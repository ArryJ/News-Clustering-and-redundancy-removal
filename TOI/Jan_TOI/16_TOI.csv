1,['16/01/2020'],Aditi Balan: Padavettu’s set is quite young and comfortable like that of my first movie Aruvi,"Her debut film was the Tamil project Aruvi , but Aditi Balan impressed many even outside the language through her performance in the film. After two years, the half Malayali- half Tamilian girl is now starting out in Malayalam too, with two plum projects in her kitty – Nivin Pauly starrer Padavettu and Kunchacko Boban’s Kolkata-based project, replacing Nithya Menen ! Aditi, who has been shooting in Kannur, shares with us more about her decision to work in Malayalam and more.The shoot of Aruvi was over in 2016 and so, it’s been three years since my first project. Quite a few Tamil projects were offered to me, but none of them interested me much. The reason was that I didn’t want to be typecast as an artiste who does only female-oriented projects or those similar to my debut film. Moreover, I am someone who landed in tinsel-ville by chance, without ever dreaming of getting into the industry. So, I didn’t feel compelled to take up anything immediately. I wanted to make sure that the film that I take up next excites me. So, I waited and that’s when Padavettu came my way.Last year, when the makers of Padavettu got in touch with me for the film, I was in Pondicherry with a theatre group named Adi Shakti, doing a workshop. There was no audition, they got in touch as they had seen my debut movie. Director Liju Krishna came over to meet me and narrated the script. Since then, we have been in touch and then I gave my confirmation. I felt that the script of this movie was simple, yet very impactful. As for the character, all I can say now is that she is quite a mature person.Yes, and we have been shooting there for a while. I reached Kannur almost a week before the shoot began, just to understand the place and language better. We shot for about 10 days in December and now, the second schedule is on, in Mattannur.Being a half Malayali, I can handle the language but I find the Kannur slang quite challenging to understand as the people here speak fast and cut many words short. I have also been spending time with people here, rather than sitting in caravans or rooms. There is also someone who comes to teach me the language.That said, the set has been quite comfortable with young people and it reminds me of the first film’s set. I was a bit nervous at first, but by the third day, I was fine.Nivin is very chilled on the sets, and is quite cooperative even when I have to go for retakes. And even to others around, he doesn’t act like he is a big star.Though I grew up in Chennai, my mom is from Mavelikara. My dad is from Chennai. We used to come here for vacations and for a few years in my childhood, we were based here. I remember going to watch Malayalam movies with my parents in my childhood. It’s with my friends that I started going for Tamil films. I have always been a huge Lalettan fan. I also had a soft corner for Jayaram sir as I always felt he looks a lot like my dad. Now, I am also learning to read and write the language.Well, from my childhood, I have been learning bharathanatyam and I have been a classical dancer. My aunt’s daughter also learns bharathanatyam with me and someone told her that the team of Yennai Arinthal wants two dancers with good height. That’s how I went for it. I was supposed to be there only for the bharathanatyam scene, but later, Gautam Menon sir asked me to be also part of a small sequence in which Trisha appears with two of her friends, in a song. I am there for hardly five seconds and I had to pause a million times to see me (laughs). At that time, I didn’t have any clue that I would be an actor one day.While I was a student, I was mostly into athletics in school and football in college, and played for our university too. And then there was dance. Though I was interested, I never got to do theatre. After finishing my graduation in LLB, I felt I should take a break and try theatre. While I was there, I was told that Aruvi’s casting is done by one of my co-artiste’s friends and that’s how I went for it. I feel I didn’t give the audition very well as I was very new to the experience. They had auditioned over 400 people, but shortlisted me. I was also asked to go for a one-day test shoot in which they made me do the basic emotions, expressions and more, which were all shot. And then, I was selected.We were supposed to start with the film’s shoot, but at the moment, its shooting is delayed.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73271187,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-740561/73271187.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/aditi-balan-padavettus-set-is-quite-young-and-comfortable-like-that-of-my-first-movie-aruvi/articleshow/73268260.cms

A month ago, BT reported that lead actor Mohit Malik was planning to quit the show, which was set to take a time leap.

Producer Nilanjana Purkayasstha confirmed the news. She said, “Yes, the show is going off air. We were planning a leap and wanted to take the story forward.

3,['16/01/2020'],"Sudeep: 'Physical injuries can be dealt with, it’s back-stabbing that really hurt'","After over two decades and an enviable repertoire of work behind him, Kannada star Kichcha Sudeep tells us he is lucky to be in the space that he is in today. “I am lucky to have people still writing roles specifically for me,” he says, as he settles in for a chat about his life now and the way ahead…There can’t be a change in career at this point. There has been a career. That way, I am lucky to be having a career like this in the first place. I guess after this point, it’s about extensions, extra feathers, extra excitement that keeps coming your way. Sometimes that doesn’t happen and that’s what we need to worry about, because life becomes monotonous. There is no journey. There is one that took place, and once you reach the destination, you tend to just be there… stagnate. It has been a journey for me, but luckily mine has not stopped. Even though there has been no deliberate attempt or plan or strategy, I continue to travel and go with the flow. If there’s a vehicle to pick me up, I just get in. Everything that has been happening has come by itself; some things I have co-ordinated and carried out, while others, I have let go. Either ways, I am happy with both. Luckily for me, there has been some excitement every year. Dabangg 3 happened last year, but more than films, it excites me to work with new people, experience new places and things.Being in a space that you never imagined you would ever be a part of, excites me. It is not about carrying baggage from your past and saying, ‘I want to do the things I have been doing back home, here as well’. It was a new experience, even though I played the antagonist. I did play a negative role in Eega, but then there was no hero to beat me up. This is about acceptance. You have accepted the role, and you need to do it whole-heartedly. I was lucky that despite there being so many people, I got my piece of cake. I came back home with a name for myself.The team gave me my space and didn’t edit or delete portions of my role, which goes to show that they respected my presence. That is probably why they wanted me to do the role. There are instances in the film for which Salman sir has written my lines. There is a scene in which I walk into a hospital and speak, and he just stands there and listens to me. This is rare, for a hero to not react to what is being thrown at him. It had happened in Kempegowda too — where Aramugam (played by P Ravishankar) walks into the police station, speaks and leaves, while I just stand there. That is bowing down to the requirement of the scene, and not doing anything extra to show that you are the hero. That made the character of Arumugam. And that is what happened with Dabangg 3 as well. If the character I played is etched in people’s minds today, I owe it to the team. They could have easily tweaked or edited out bits of the performance. They did not do that and have been sweet.Whenever you meet genuine people, and there is no agenda attached to how they are with you, bonds are bound to be created. Everybody has enough experience to understand whether, or not, there is an agenda to a connection. Maybe we do not speak about it openly, but we just know it. But when you just like the other person’s presence in your life, with zero expectations, then you start cherishing the time spent together. I have never asked him (Salman) to do anything for me. If he comes to meet me here, it has to happen organically, and not because I have called him. We text each other, and are in constant touch. It is nice when one gets a response from people who you least expect to even know. Salman too reacts to people. He has seen all kinds of people — the good and the bad. So, when he stays connected with people, then that means it is something nice.I am looking forward to the release of Kotigobba 3 . I am also excited about my new film, Phantom, to be directed by Anup Bhandari. We are doing a trial shoot to test the look and feel for this film. It should go on floors after the Bigg Boss Kannada finale; probably by the first week of February. Phantom is a thriller, the narrative of which takes place a few years in the past. It is set in a time when there was minimal commuting and communication and that brings the thrill factor to the forefront. Content-wise, it is a subject that has touched me. It is not a typical film and is new for me. The film will be shot on sets and the aim is to make a visually fabulous movie. Anup and I were to work on Billa Ranga Bhasha. But then, he shared this script with me and asked for feedback. I felt we needed to do this first. This film was not written for me, but I was drawn to the content, which is out-of-the-box. I want to do such films.It can’t be low budget anymore, right? My remuneration is already huge. But on a serious note, we discussed Phantom and I took it to another level. I insisted that there should be no changes to the story just because I am a part of it. The content is beautiful, so it was important to keep it that way, and not fill the storyline with unnecessary elements. The story should remain the way it is. What matters is having a vision about presentation– what you want to shoot at one location, should look like say… the Raiders of the Lost Ark. It is not just about creating that area, or place. The team has been working on this for almost a year now. Many shoot floors have already been booked for over six months since set work is in process at all these locations.Frankly, I have never worked on a new look for a script, I have done that for myself. There’s nothing in a script that connects it to how I should present myself onscreen. The audience does not come to watch a film with an idea of how the character in the film should look. The look is what an actor offers to his audience. I feel good if I am able to offer something new. When I see the poster of my film, if nothing apart from the title and the costumes I wear is different from my previous poster, then, for me, it is a personal disaster. I put in an effort, but by doing so I also cut down the momentum of my work too, because you can only do one film at a time. Luckily, that has worked out that way for me.There are many interesting projects that keep coming up, but I like to keep my book open because anything exciting can come up suddenly. It makes no sense to hurry up with things that excite you, as things may go wrong, by which time you find yourself too deep in it. I should be in a position where I can pull back anytime. If things are not working out fine, I do get practical about it and step out. What happens is that you tend to succumb to commitment — if you have taken a rupee, you are committed. I don’t take money till a point when I can see how a team is getting ahead with a promised script. If it is going the right way, where everyone on the team wakes up with one intention — to make a good film — then I am in for the long haul. There are a lot of projects that are being discussed right now. I am very happy that I wake up with confidence each day, because there are people out there who are still writing stories for me. That’s what has always kept me alive; not my hits, but the writers who are writing for me as it gives me a lot of security.Yes, I have; I want to do something. I have always directed my films at regular intervals. This time around, there has been a long gap. Telling a story has always excited me more than just being a part of it. I want to narrate a story now and plan to start this mid-year.Physical injuries can be dealt with. There is always a cure, and you know that it is going to be fixed. Back-stabbing hurts more; there is no medicine or cure for it and you just need to accept it. It usually comes from very beautiful places and sources you least expect it from. Those injuries have been far more. It has only made me look at everything in a different way right now. Things don’t hurt me anymore. Accept that apology that does not come, and go easy on yourself. That works out better. Anger is a very pure emotion, much stronger than love. Irrespective of whether you wake up thinking about your loved ones or not, you will surely wake up thinking about this person you are angry with. You should not allow someone to occupy that kind of space in your mind; it is not worth it. It’s better to forget about it.See, I am not here to prove a point to anyone. Life is treating me well. What more does one want? What is success to me? Today, I can go buy what I want and go where I want. I am also in a position to help people around me. Earlier, all this needed to be planned. Today, I can. And that is success for me. I don’t want to compare myself with someone else; I am out of that zone. I am quite sorted with what I have in life. But that does not mean it is over. My competitiveness towards certain things won’t stop. My Friday challenges (film releases) will still remain. I don’t intend to overtake anybody in life. But I will always protect what I am doing. I have been invaded, and that has only made me more cautious. I am not vindictive, though, and I will never do what others have done to me. I have learnt where the loopholes are. For instance, having a kingdom does not mean that we need to be at war all the time. We just need to protect our fort. I am happy with what I have and I am learning to protect it.Do you find yourself not being able to trust new people?It is better not to trust. All the people who you trusted are still around. You are here for professional reasons, there is no need to go out of your way to trust someone, unless it happens organically. But you can still be nice to each other. You need to know where to place new people in your life all of a sudden. But if you give someone a place of priority, and then crib about it — that does not make sense. Trusting them in the first place is your mistake. Nobody asked you to trust them. You need to know where you position them. If you see your life as a game, say, a chess board, you need to position people in the right place and need all the pawns to play your game right.They also say beware what you wish for. We aim big, wanting to get to a certain space, but we never ask how many people are travelling to this space with you. It is not about how many are going in the same direction. It is about an individual aim and journey. The journey becomes about individual achievements — about I, I and I. You finally reach the top of Mount Everest and put up your flag and realise that there is nobody else with you there. It’s okay. But let’s take the positive side of this, not everybody can do that also. And after a while, it is better if you are by yourself. The world is a much more peaceful place that way. It gets lonely at the top; there are fewer people left with you, but that is the norm of life.You wake up in the morning and life teaches you all that you need to learn. I am a bad reader, I don’t read books. But education comes from the least expected sources. My learning has always been from my life, and my experiences, not from anybody else’s philosophy. If you look for it, you will get your own lesson in life. We can all write our books, just that I am not interested.I have said this before, I will lead a life worth writing a book about some day. I don’t want to write about it. Others may find it interesting, somehow, and if they do, they might set about writing it — with a proper interpretation I hope.aI cannot say that I know everything that is happening in the industry, because I am not aware. The ones I am aware of, I get to know due to the small effort from my side to see what people want to show me and a huge effort from them to show me what they have done. People come home and I take time to watch their work, and even given whatever feedback that comes to my mind. If they think that my presence is going to help them in any way, then I do make that effort — as long as it is helping somebody.Living in both the cities is about what one is trying to cater to. I want to cater to cinema. Bengaluru is my hometown and I love it, but the resources required for what I am catering to do not match up now. There is traffic and a scarcity of studios. The scale of the project being made also needs to be taken into consideration. Availability of locations here does not depend on your seniority or stardom, it is on a first-come-first-service basis. That’s why I am looking at working in Hyderabad, where there are a lot of resources. I am only trying to make my film look better, richer — at the same cost. It is not about liking or loving a place for any particular reason; it is about what works best.Cricket has and will always be a part of my life. There have been a lot of speed breaks on that journey though. The moment something takes off, something else happens and we slow down again. But we always play the game, even if it is over a weekend; we have at least one match every month. We missed out on the Karnataka Chalanachitra Cup last year because of certain issues — unavailability of the grounds and some of the players. It was supposed to take place in January this year, but the ongoing police inquiry into the official game has delayed our plans too. There is again a scarcity of space. We have a window again in August-September this year. We are working towards a tournament then — if it works, it works.I used to paint, and I still do. More recently, I did a sketch of Salman. I wanted to give it to him on his birthday. I still have not, because on that day there was too much of a crowd. I will give it to him one of these days. There are certain people you really don’t know what to gift, and they don’t expect anything either. But at the same time, you can’t give them anything that they don’t already have. It has happened in my friend’s circle as well. But I think it is the presence and the thought that really matters. It is not that I don’t like gifts, but I don’t want people to buy anything big either. It is the small gestures that matter. So, what I could think of as a gift for Salman was this sketch.I love cooking. I keep cooking for people. I enjoy the process. Only baking takes a little more time and a lot of precision. It is only when you start baking that you feel bad for all the bakers in town. When you bake a bun, you realise how long it takes and the precision needed in the process of getting there. Once you have done that, you also respect what you buy from bakers. I do bake a lot. While people are busy buying souvenirs during their travels, at any new place, local food and ingredients top my shopping list. I buy the special spices and sauces available in that country, as well as traditional utensils that they use. I buy them, as that makes a difference in the authenticity of creating the dish. I do want to start an exclusive restaurant, once I retire — a quaint small place with five or six tables. I will cook and say this is my dish for the day. I don’t want to depend on it for my income, but I just want to have something like that out there because it gives me pleasure. It will probably be at a place where people will come to the restaurant, not for me, but for the food, because I don’t want to encash in on my popularity as an actor for this. So, it may not even be in this country, I don’t know.

5,['16/01/2020'],Chikkanna: I know that comedy is my strong suit: Chikkanna,"Getting a hold of Chikkanna , one of Kannada cinema’s most popular comedians, is really tough, because when he is not hopping from one set to the other, he is sleeping. When we finally got through to him, he was on a day off for Sankranti, celebrating the festival with family. So, how many films is he working on currently? “There are seven or eight films,” Chikkanna says and begins rattling off names, adding, “I think I have done close to 200 films in my nine years in the industry, so, my next goal is to turn hero. In fact, director-actor Manju Mandavya , with whom I am co-starring in this week’s Sri Bharatha Bahubali , is making my debut as hero. We have agreed on the basic premise of the story, but it is yet to be developed into a full-fledged script. I am looking at finishing my current acting commitments and then concentrating on my transition to protagonist,” says Chikkanna. Does that mean that his days as a comedian are over? “It really depends on whether audiences accept me as a hero. The truth is that most supporting actors who have made the transition successfully don’t ever return to their roots. While I do want to be a hero, I know that comedy is my strong suit and will work on films in that genre. I have no illusions that I can pass off for a romantic hero. I will do what suits me,” says the actor.Up next, though, is Sri Bharatha Bahubali, which, while introducing Manju as hero, has Chikkanna in a role that qualifies as second lead. “For a long time now, I have only been doing films in which I have had fairly substantial roles in terms of screen presence and characterization, like, for instance, the hero’s friend. In Sri Bharatha Bahubali, I am Bahubali, Bharatha’s friend. We are village lads, whose chance encounter with the heroine, Sri, and the journey they undertake, forms the crux of the story,” he explains.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73272062,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-100185/73272062.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/i-know-that-comedy-is-my-strong-suit-and-will-work-on-films-in-that-genre-as-hero/articleshow/73272062.cms

7,['16/01/2020'],Srishti students feel unsafe; college shut for 3 days,"""What happened on Tuesday was shocking. We feel scared and unsafe,” said students of Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology in Yelahanka, a day after some political workers, led by the local MLA, reportedly raised concerns over graffiti on a wall outside the school gate, ‘creating a ruckus’ near the campus. According to the workers, the two portraits were reportedly “cartoonish and insulting”, and they blamed the students for having put them up.The students, however, said that the matter didn’t end there. Questions were also raised about the institution’s dress code and vehicle parking rules. On condition of anonymity, a female student said, “We always park our vehicles outside the school, and so do our faculty members. No one has ever objected to that earlier. But, on Tuesday, questions were asked about what we wear to college and where we park our vehicles. This, we felt, was an instance of moral policing, and not just a concern about the art work.”Adding to this, another student said, “In fact, the school management has sent out a circular asking students not to attend classes for three days, until the situation returns to normalcy. We have also been instructed not to move around in a group. Although, there is no confirmation on who has painted the graffiti yet, the MLA claims that there are CCTV cameras installed, and that they are watching us 24X7. The very thought that someone is keeping an eye on you is scary and disturbing.” “We have always been taught about the importance of free thinking and freedom of expression. But when such incidents take place at our own campus, it makes us question everything that we are taught,” say the students.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73271023,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-223216/73271023.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/srishti-students-feel-unsafe-college-shut-for-3-days/articleshow/73271023.cms

WASHINGTON: The US on Wednesday signed the first phase of a trade deal with China, which President Donald Trump described as historic, concluding more than a year of tough negotiations including several months of suspension of talks between the two largest economies of the world.

The first phase of the trade deal includes Intellection Property (IP) Protection and Enforcement, ending forced technology transfer, dramatic expansion of American agriculture, removing barriers to American financial services, ending currency manipulation, rebalancing the US-China trade relationship and effective dispute resolution.

The agreement was signed by President Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, Politburo Member and Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China .

In his remarks, Trump called the trade agreement signing ""a momentous step... to a future of fair and reciprocal trade.""

The two countries are ""writing the wrongs of the past,"" the US President said, adding that he would soon visit China and thanked his Chinese counterpart for this deal.

""I'll be going over to China in the not-too-distant future to reciprocate,"" he said.

This is a transformative deal that will bring great benefits for the two countries, Trump said, hoping that this will even lead to a peaceful world.

Trump said that China has made substantial and enforceable commitment to protecting American ideas.

At the same time, he said, punitive tariffs on China would remain in place till the time the second phase of the trade deal is agreed.

Describing this as the start of new chapter in US-China relations, Vice President Mike Pence quoted an ancient Chinese proverb: ""let today be the beginning of a brighter future... more prosperous"" for both the American and Chinese people.

The agreement was signed in front of Mike Pence, several of his Cabinet Colleagues including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and top officials.

Former Secretary of State Henry Kessinger , who is considered to be the architect of the modern US-China relations, was present on the occasion.

Who's Who of the American corporate world including Master Card CEO Ajay Banga and Sanjay Mehrotra from Micron were also present in the East Room of the White House during the signing ceremony.

""This historic agreement includes a major commitment by China to make significant reforms in a wide range of critical areas and to make substantial additional purchases of American goods and services in the coming years,"" the White House said.

This agreement is strengthened by a strong dispute resolution system that ensures prompt and effective implementation and enforcement of this historic deal, it said.

Congressman Kevin Brady, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee described this as a historic day for American workers and businesses.

""President Trump, Trade Ambassador Lighthizer and Secretary Mnuchin are achieving what no White House has before them: a strong, real and enforceable commitment from China to end unfair trade practices and level the playing field for American workers, manufacturers, farmers, and businesses,"" he said.

""I hope this proves to be a turning point in our economic relationship with China, but I've seen enough history to be clear-eyed,"" Senator Chuck Grassley said.

""Not only must China follow through with its commitments in this phase one deal, but also work toward a comprehensive agreement that ends forced technology transfers, intellectual property theft and unfair restrictions on US goods, including agriculture. Only then will we know if China can be a reliable economic partner in the 21st century,"" Grassley said.

Former US Vice President Joe Biden, who is a leading Democratic presidential candidate, alleged that China is the big winner of Trump's ""phase-one"" trade deal with Beijing.

""True to form, Trump is getting precious little in return for the significant pain and uncertainty he has imposed on our economy, farmers, and workers,"" he said.

""The deal won't actually resolve the real issues at the heart of the dispute, including industrial subsidies, support for state-owned enterprises, cybertheft, and other predatory practices in trade and technology,"" Biden said.

The US Chamber of Commerce welcomed the signing and said: ""we commend both governments for staying the course and taking this important step to rebuild trust and restore some stability in the world's most important commercial relationship"".

""This deal provides much needed certainty to American businesses as they begin the new year,"" said US Chamber CEO Thomas Donohue.

The phase one agreement signals a rollback of the tit-for-tat tariff measures that have hurt American companies and consumers and includes important structural commitments from the Chinese, the chambers said.

China's commitments expand market access for American businesses in agriculture, manufacturing, and financial services; strengthen IP protection and enforcement; and address unfair technology transfer practices, it said.

Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, in a speech on the Senate floor, said Trump's ""phase-one"" trade deal with China is an extreme disappointment.

""He's conceding our leverage for vague, unenforceable ""promises"" China never intends to fulfil,"" he said.

""Based on what we know of this so called 'Phase One' deal, China hasn't agreed to substantively do anything new, and now it seems that the Trump tariffs will remain in place even after the deal is signed,"" Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said.

11,['16/01/2020'],"Chandrashekhar Azad gets bail, but can’t enter Delhi, protest here for 4 weeks","This story is from January 16, 2020

NEW DELHI: A day after it upheld Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad ’s constitutional right to protest, a Delhi court on Wednesday granted him bail but barred him from entering the capital for four weeks or holding any “dharna” here till the elections are on.

Additional sessions judge Kamini Lau recorded that there was no material to show Azad’s direct involvement in instigating violence during an anti-CAA protest at Jama Masjid on December 20, and then slapped the strict bail conditions.

Saying that “the nation cannot be exposed to anarchy”, the court gave Azad 24 hours to leave the city and return to his native UP, and pointed out that special circumstances call for special conditions.

“While in Saharanpur , Azad would mark his presence before the SHO at Fatehpur police station on every Saturday for four weeks. In case Azad has to visit AIIMS for his medical condition, he will first inform DCP crime who will provide him with an escort,” the court directed.

If Tuesday saw the court question the evidence cited by police and stress on the right to protest, ASJ Lau reminded everyone on Wednesday that “at the same time, our Constitution strikes a fine balance between rights and duties. While exercising our right of peaceful protest, it is our duty to ensure that no corresponding right of another is violated and no inconvenience is caused to anyone.”

“There is no material in the form of CCTV footage or audio recordings to prima facie show the direct involvement of the accused with the alleged violence,” the judge noted, adding that Azad maintains he read out the Preamble (to the Constitution) but police allege he made “inflammatory statements, details of which have not been placed on record, so much so that there was no statement of any eyewitness to affirm the same.”

During the verdict pronouncement, Azad’s counsel Mehmood Pracha said the Bhim Army chief faces threat in UP.

But the court clarified that the condition has been imposed till February 16, observing that “violence or destruction of property was totally unacceptable and for any kind of damage, it is the organisers who would be responsible and liable to compensate for the loss. There has to be zero tolerance for any kind of violence and lawlessness cannot be encouraged.”

It also noted that “it has to be ensured that these protests do not last for a long time at places under public use”.

While the judge agreed with Azad’s central claim that reading the Preamble cannot prima facie be taken as incitement, she took exception to a few social media posts by him, including one targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi . “This is problematic. Our institutions must be respected,” the court remarked.

Shabana Azmi and Javed Akhtar (BCCL)

Hectic preparations are going on for writer-poet-lyricist Javed Akhtar ’s Jadu’s 75th birthday celebrations that run from January 14-17th, 2020. Friends and family are trooping in from different parts of the world while wife Shabana Azmi is in Budapest trying to organise this production in between her shooting. “Yeh toh ladki ki shaadi ho rahi hai aisa lag raha hai!” says Azmi. Several activities have been planned for the writer’s birthday. Apart from an exhibition of his photo, posters and paintings curated by Pradeep Chandra and SM Ausaja on January 15, a small fun party at the couple’s home to bring in his birthday has also been planned. Also, a party will be hosted by Akhtar’s kids Zoya and Farhan and wife Shabana the next day at a Mumbai hotel.

On 14th the very successful Kaifi Azmi Birth Centenary came to a close with the screening of his son Baba Azmi’s first directorial debut Mee Raqsam. “That’s quite a handful! I’ve got into a zen kind of space,” says Shabana, who has produced the film, adding, “I definitely do not want to become a producer. It’s so much easier being an actor.”

“Not surprisingly all the conversation revolves around food. We are a family of gluttons,” she says with a laugh while talking about the birthday celebrations of Akhtar.

“It's a milestone birthday and I want to salute the man that is Javed Akhtar- his indomitable will, his tenacity, his

wisdom, and his intellect! And of course his legendary sense of humour,” she adds lovingly.

13,['16/01/2020'],How much cheaper is a tax-free film?,"Recently, several states made Deepika Padukone's 'Chhapaak', a film on acid attack survivors, tax-free, while UP made Ajay Devgn 's 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Hero', a film on Maratha warrior Tanhaji Malusare , tax-free. Maharashtra is considering making both the films tax-free, as per Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat, who said, ""Earlier, the Revenue ministry used to take a decision on making a movie tax-free, but now the tax has been subsumed in the GST."" Since GST (Goods and Services Tax ) came into effect, what exactly does a film's tax-free status mean?In December 2018, two GST slabs were announced for films – 18% for tickets above Rs 100, and 12% for tickets below Rs 100. This tax is divided between the state and central government (State GST and Central GST). When a state declares a film 'tax-free', now it exempts only half of the entertainment tax, which would be either 9% or 6%, as per the ticket price. For the multiplex audience, since there are hardly any tickets available below Rs 100, the default exemption would be 9%. Cinema hall owners say that declaring a film tax-free had a bigger impact in the pre-GST years, when every state had different entertainment tax and the state governments could exempt the whole amount. Now, a moviegoer still needs to pay Central GST even for tax-exempted films. With GST in play, now the tax-free status of a film means endorsement of a film by the state government, rather than any significant monetary benefit.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73271554,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-49085/73271554.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/how-much-cheaper-is-a-tax-free-film/articleshow/73271552.cms
14,['16/01/2020'],Malang’s romantic title track has a Sufi touch,"After the melodious Chal Ghar Chalen, the makers of ' Malang ' are set to release the film’s title track today. The Sufi number, featuring Disha Patani and Aditya Roy Kapur , is penned by Kunaal Vermaa and Haarsh Limbhachiyaa. Director Mohit Suri says, “This song captures the theme of the film perfectly. It’s one of those tracks that will instantly strike a chord with the listeners.”Ved Sharma, who has composed and sung the track, says, “It is a vibrant and romantic number with a Sufi touch. A lot of inspiration for this song was drawn from one of Amir Khusro’s dohas; there’s a deep meaning to his words. The biggest challenge for me was to bring out Aditya’s character through the song. Mohit sir wanted the vocal tone to match that of Aditya’s as well as the vibe of the character he plays in the film.” The film also stars Anil Kapoor and Kunal Kemmu.Haarsh, who has been mostly associated with stand-up comedy shows on TV, says, “Not many people know that I am a lyricist as well. When the news about the song surfaced, many asked me whether the song was in the comic or serious genre.” Talking about the Sufi touch lent to the song, he says, “Sufi gaano ki toh baat hi alag hoti hai. Maine jaise hi iss gaane ki dhunn suni main genuinely iss gaane ka fan ho gaya tha. This song is soulful, and there is another version of it in the film, which is trance and party mix. So, there are two moods — tandav and yog.”Kunaal, who has previously written songs like Hasi Ban Gaye ('Hamari Adhuri Kahani') and Lost Without You ('Half Girlfriend'), says, “This is my hat-trick with Mohit sir. He wanted a few words to be incorporated in the song, but at the same time, told me ki jaisa aur jis mood mein likhna hai likho. The title track is about surprises and adventures life throws when you are travelling.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73273812,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-65390/73273812.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/malangs-romantic-title-track-has-a-sufi-touch/articleshow/73273810.cms

Wanting to help make society better

People who hear about his mission offer him food and shelter along the way

‘People have been so warm and kind in Maharashtra’

He's received a warm welcome in the city

Where to next?

At 20, he’s not just a youngster voicing opinions on issues, but also walking the talk, ratherriding it! Chandrakanth Hodepally has embarked on a ride through the length and breadth of India — a 30,000 kms tour covering 28 States. On a mission to spread the ‘ Say No To Rape ’ message, he wants to bring about a change on that front by creating awareness on the rape crisis in India wherever he goes. We caught up with Chandu (as he is called by those around him) when he passed through Mumbai recently to talk about his journey.Having set off from his home city of Hyderabad on January 1, Chandu rode to Telangana and then headed towards Maharashtra via the Nagpur-Amravati route. So far, he has been to Nagpur, Amravati, Bheed, Solapur, Aurangabad and Pune. He arrived in Mumbai on Tuesday evening after riding through Lonavala . “I have just completed 1,900 km and was a little dehydrated, so I had to go to the hospital for a check-up,” says the cyclist , adding that he’s living his dream despite the difficulties.“I had decided to take up this mission on a cycle when I was in school in class 10,” he says, adding, “I was disturbed when I read up on the rape incidents that had taken place recently. I do not have sisters, but I felt the pain and anguish that the women and their families must have gone through. Right then, I decided to create an increased awareness about rising rape incidences on my cycle. I preferred this mode of travelling as it offers zero-pollution.” However, a mammoth ride like this is anything, but easy. “India is a huge country. When I charted my course on the map, I saw that I will have to cover 30,000 kms. Some states will have longer rides, some shorter. For instance, it will be 2,000 kms in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh as these are vast states. And in Mizoram, it might be only 500 kms as it is a hilly region, but not easy to navigate on wheels.”It’s a huge mission that Chandu had undertaken, but he isn't bothered by the money factor (or the lack of it). Says the cyclist, “I started out with empty pockets. My mother insisted I keep something at least to begin with and she gave me ` 500. I still have that amount. I am trying hard not to use it throughout the entire journey. People have been giving me food and shelter so far.”Chandu loves his experience in Maharashtra. He says, “People are so warm and kind here. Ever since I have come to this state, I have had such touching experiences. People take one look at me and see that I am doing something for society. They ask me questions and share so many words of support. They have even arranged a stay and meals for me. I’m having vada pav every day here,” he grins.Chandu will take off to Nasik and Dhule and the next leg will see him ride to Indore in Madhya Pradesh. “My aim is to meet people wherever I go and talk about the need to respect women and stop the rape culture,” he says, adding, “I had a small placard on my cycle and a cyclist friend from Mumbai, Pranay Patel gave me a dry fit T-shirt that says, ‘Say No To Rape’. When I complete my tour, I’ll have an album of pictures to share as well as stories of my experiences.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73271021,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-36311,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/meet-the-20-year-old-whos-cycling-around-india-for-a-cause/articleshow/73270558.cms
19,['16/01/2020'],From choosing homestays and public transport to carrying your own cutlery and toiletries: Make your trips eco-friendly,"The year 2017 was designated by the United Nations as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development. Two years later, in 2019, it became one of the biggest travel trends across the world. In August that year, Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg refused to take an aeroplane, which contributes to atmospheric carbon pollution, and sailed across the Atlantic – she travelled by a sailboat from Plymouth, England, to attend a UN summit in New York, US – putting climate crisis and sustainable travelling in the spotlight. But according to a global survey conducted by a leading digital travel platform, 37% respondents agreed that they do not know how to travel sustainably. If travelling tops your new year resolution's list and you have started mapping your escapes, here is a ready-reckoner you can refer to make your trips eco-friendly.As a sustainable traveller, one should aim for a zero-waste experience. Using disposable tissues and toiletries at hotels and stays generate waste which eventually ends up adding to the garbage pile. ""I travelled to Jageshwar Dham (Uttarakhand) and carried wooden tooth brush, shampoo and toothpaste. We asked the hotel staff to take away the disposable toiletries from the room,"" says Madhu Mittal, a member of a residents' group in Noida, which leads anti-plastic campaigns and promotes sustainability.Rashi Grover, who leads an initiative in her locality in Green Park, which promotes waste-segregation and discourages littering, adds, ""We carry our own hand towels in bags which we keep washing and reusing throughout our journey. Though paper tissues are considered eco-friendly, they still generate waste which we want to avoid.""In order to ensure an eco-friendly stay, Nishand Venugopal, another Delhi resident, does an extensive research before embarking on a trip. He says, ""I always look for a stay which incorporates environment-friendly practices and is constructed of mud rather than concrete. Being a birder, I also ensure that the location of the hotel or stay is not in hindrance with the natural animal habitat of the region.""Supriya Sardana, who promotes sustainability in her locality in Noida through campaigns and workshops, says that she opts for homestays rather than hotels. ""I prefer homestays as they do not contribute to wastage of single-use plastics and other fancies which hotels do.""Prerna, who is also the founder of an eco-friendly travel agency, adds that there has been a rise in the number of people preferring to stay at environment-friendly stays. ""All our stays are mud constructions and the areas have over 30% green cover. In the past one year, queries for environment-friendly stays have doubled, with many opting for places which indulge environment-friendly practices like rainwater harvesting, growing own veggies and avoiding use of single-use plastic products, among other things,"" she tells us.55% of global travellers report being more determined to make sustainable travel choices than they were a year ago, but barriers include a lack of knowledge and appealing options when trying to put this into practice41%request travel companies to offer tips on how to be more sustainable while travelling68% would like the money they spend on travel to go back into the local community52%global travellers say they now alter behaviours to be more sustainable while travelling, such as walking, riding a bike or hiking whenever possible72% global travellers are seeking authentic experiences that are representative of the local culture56% respondents say that if there was an option to offset the carbon footprint on their vacation accommodation, they would do itThough a road trip with friends in your own car may entice you to have your own 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' moment, it is not the best option when you are trying to reduce carbon footprint. ""Travelling by bus or train is an eco-friendly option for sustainable travellers. Though not all carbon emissions can be avoided, taking a public conveyance can at least distribute the emissions,"" says Vikrant Tongad, an environmentalist from Greater Noida.Ensure that you bring back any trash that is generated while travelling and recycle it. ""Even after trying our best, some trash was generated on our two-day trip to Dehradun. This included a couple of tissue papers, two paper plates and two chips wrappers, which my kids insisted on having. I brought them back home to make an eco-brick out of it,"" says Sameera Satija, a Gurgaon resident, who started a steel crockery bank in 2018.An eco-brick is a concept which recycles plastic bottles and trash paper or wrappers. ""We stuff the plastic bottles with all the trash until its full, so it becomes solid as a bricks. These eco-bricks have multiple uses.

20,['16/01/2020'],Congress govt showed no interest in nailing 1984 rioters: Panel,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court-appointed Justice S N Dhingra Commitee has slammed the then Union government and Delhi Police for showing utter lack of interest in booking 1984 anti-Sikh rioters for murder, arson and violence and for trying to hush up the criminal cases.“Despite a large number of victims approaching various agencies (including Justice Ranganath Misra Commission) soon after the riots and for a few years thereafter, still a large number of crimes of murders, rioting, looting, arson remained unpunished and untraced. The basic reason for these crimes remaining unpunished and culprits getting scot-free was lack of interest shown by the police and by the authorities in handling these cases as per law or to proceed with the intention of punishing the culprits,” the Justice Dhingra committee’s report said in a scathing indictment of the Congress government led by the late Rajiv Gandhi .“The whole efforts of the police and the administration seem to have been to hush up the criminal cases concerning riots,” it said.The committee castigated the manner in which the Justice Ranganath Misra Commission cursorily handled the hundreds of affidavits filed by victims alleging murder, rioting, violence and arson against Sikh community members in the aftermath of Indira Gandhi ’s assassination in October 1984.“This is also clear from the fact that hundreds of affidavits were received by Justice Ranganath Misra Commission in respect of killings, arson and looting done by the rioters with named accused persons. Instead of directing registration of FIRs on the basis of these affidavits by respective police stations and ordering investigation, committee after committee was formed and this further delayed registration of cases for years,” it said, and pointed out that FIRs were registered in 1991 and 1992 on the basis of affidavits filed before the Misra commission in 1985.On the shoddy manner in which trial courts acquitted the accused on the hyper-technical ground of delay, the Justice Dhingra committee told the SC, “Despite this, in almost all cases, the trial judges, to whom cases were sent for trial after investigation, rejected the testimonies of witnesses on the ground of delay in filing of FIRs, delay in recording of statement of witnesses and similar other grounds.The committee recommended filing of appeals against six judgments recording acquittal of accused by additional sessions judge S S Bal in 1995 relating to murders (four FIRs in Nand Nagri area, one FIR each in Delhi Cantonment and Nangloi area); and acquittal recorded by additional sessions judge S P S Chaudhari in 1986 on an FIR relating to an anti-Sikh riot case in Delhi Cantonment area.The committee also found that then SHO of Kalyanpuri police station, Survir Singh Tyagi, was in conspiracy with the rioters. “Tyagi deliberately disarmed local Sikhs of their licensed arms so that the rioters could make them victims and cause loss of life and property. He was suspended from service but was later reinstated and promoted as ACP. The committee is of the view that his case be referred to riot cell of Delhi Police for action,” it said.The report will reinforce the view of those who have maintained that the Rajiv Gandhi government let the violence continue in the wake of Indira Gandhi’s killing by her Sikh bodyguards. Coming during the run-up to Delhi polls, it will provide fresh ammunition to opponents of Congress, which is already lagging AAP and BJP.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta on Wednesday told a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant that the Union government accepted the recommendations of the Justice Dhingra committee and would take action as per the suggestions.The committee said the police did not register FIRs crime-wise and clubbed all complaints from one area into one FIR. “In FIR 268 of 1984 of Sultanpuri police stations, the DCP sent 337 complaints received by him soon after the riots, about incidents of burning, looting, injuries, murders etc, to Sultanpuri police station for action. Instead of recording a separate FIR in respect of each of the incident, an omnibus FIR was recorded in respect of all the 337 incidents reported to the DCP by victims and thereafter all other complaints of killing and rioting were also added to the same FIR with a result that this FIR had 498 incidents of rioting, arson, looting, burning, causing injuries and murders.“One IO was assigned to this case. It is humanly impossible for one IO to investigate about 500 cases, to trace witnesses of each crime, to prepare challan (chargesheet) and to proceed in court against all the accused persons,” the committee said.“Had the administration and police been serious in punishing the culprits, a special task force for investigating crimes committed within the jurisdiction of each police station would have been created by providing necessary infrastructure, including forensic teams and labs to this task force. Hundreds of bodies remained unidentified. Police did not preserve any forensic evidence with regard to unidentified bodies so that at a later stage, identification through forensic evidence could be done,” it added.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73282629,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-134522,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-govt-showed-no-interest-in-nailing-1984-rioters-panel/articleshow/73282446.cms
21,['16/01/2020'],Govt sending 36 ministers to J&amp;K in massive outreach,"This story is from January 16, 2020

NEW DELHI: A massive confidence building exercise is being launched by the government in Jammu and Kashmir post nullification of Article 370 as a large number of Union ministers have been tasked to reach out to people of the newly-formed Union territory and tell them how the recent legislation will be beneficial for the region.

Starting from January 18, as many as 36 Union ministers will go to 52 places in J&K. Ministers will reach out to people across the UT up to panchayat level and share with them how the Centre has planned to expedite the development process in the region, which was being affected due to some provisions of Article 370.

This will be the first high level “mass” outreach after provisions of Article 370 were scrapped on August 5, 2019. The ministers are expected to speak on development initiatives that the Centre plans to undertake in the newly-bifurcated UTs of J&K and Ladakh.

The public contact is also intended to signal to people that they are being accorded priority and the government is serious about accelerating development work. The presence of ministers will also express confidence in the abilities of the UT administration and India’s claim over its sovereign territory.

Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, railway minister Piyush Goyal , textiles minister Smriti Irani and several other senior ministers are set to visit the UT. Ramesh Pokhriyal , Jitendra Singh, Kiren Rijiju, Hardeep Singh Puri, Anurag Thakur and Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti are other ministers in the list of those likely to travel through Srinagar, Jammu and other regions.

Visit of the Union ministers, close on the heels of the recent visit of foreign diplomats and MPs from the European Union , is also a bid to showcase that the situation in the Valley is normalising and people have started accepting the legislative changes through which Article 370 was abrogated.

NEW DELHI: The last mile is always the hardest and the situation is no different for Air India as it awaits outcome of the government ’s second move to sell it off. The airline, which is yet to pay December salary, has almost completely run out of funds and is now struggling to keep flying in the absence of equity infusion this fiscal.Sample this: One of AI’s Airbus has been grounded in Vadodara for almost a week as its requires engine replacement. The Maharaja has a spare engine for this single aisle aircraft in Delhi but is unable to send it as it can’t raise the e-way bill because of GST dues. “Our GST dues are about Rs 100 crore and because of that the paperwork required to send the engine to Vadodara is not being done,” said a senior official.The airline hopes to pay the GST dues on Thursday, along with salary to employees. “We have raised the cash to pay for these things from our ticket sales. Hopefully we will be able to send the engine to Vadodara once some GST dues are paid Thursday and then we raise the E-way required for that shipment,” said the official.Amid a life-threatening fund crunch, AI and the government are trying to restore faith among flyers to book tickets. Last November, aviation minister H S Puri said in Parliament that AI “would have to be closed down if not privatised.” After that, the airline saw a sharp dip in advance bookings. “On a year-on-year basis, we have witnessed 10-15% drop in advance bookings,” said a person in the know.In the past few days, the government has been trying to assure passengers that AI will keep flying till it is sold off. “MoCA (ministry of civil aviation) reiterates that the government, while going ahead with the disinvestment , would ensure that AI continues to operate uninterruptedly and improves its operations also. There is no cause for worry to any of its stakeholders,” the ministry tweeted on Tuesday to allay concerns of both travellers and the airline’s unpaid employees.Before this, AI chairman Ashwani Lohani — who has informed the government about the airline’s frail financial health — had tweeted on January 4: “Rumours regarding AI shutting down or closing operations are all baseless. AI would continue to fly and also expand and there should be no cause for concern whatsoever to travellers, corporates or agents. AI, the national carrier, is still the biggest airline of India.” After these assurances, the dip in bookings has ebbed.Despite its financials, AI — which somehow raised funds to make nearly all its wide body Boeing 777 and 787s fly — has aggressively expanded its foreign operations in recent months. “AI has launched/announced 12 international flights since April 1, 2019, and this is indeed a tremendous achievement as well as a magnificent contribution towards international travel from/to India. This also shows the tremendous inner strength of the airline,” Lohani tweeted on Wednesday.The grounded plane in Vadodara is lucky. AI has so far not been able to raise funds to make its 12 grounded Airbus A320 family planes take to the skies again. “These aircraft require engines and we already have significant dues to engine manufacturers. That is why we have not been able to get new replacement engines for our 12 single aisles,” said an official.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73290525,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-144505,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/air-india-cant-move-engine-over-rs-100-crore-gst-dues/articleshow/73282921.cms

24,['16/01/2020'],"Exports contract for 5th month in row, imports dip 8.8%","This story is from January 16, 2020

(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: The country’s exports contracted for the fifth consecutive month in December, dragged down by a decline in shipments of plastics, gems and jewellery, leather products and chemicals.

Official data showed on Wednesday that exports fell 1.8% to 27.4 billion in December, while imports contracted for the seventh successive month. Imports fell by 8.8% at $38.6 billion in December 2019 which enabled narrowing of the trade deficit to $11.3 billion.

Exports have been under pressure due to a string of factors including the impact of the bruising global trade war between the US and China and the slowdown in key markets.

The pain was spread across sectors with 18 of the 30 crucial segments, contracting during the month. Experts have called for measures to boost exports and all eyes are now in the upcoming February budget for measures to accelerate shipments of goods from the country.

“The decline in the merchandise trade deficit in December 2019 relative to December 2018 was driven by the relatively broad-based contraction in imports, led by industrial inputs such as coal, chemicals, iron and steel, and non-ferrous metals, transport equipment, as well as consumer items such as precious and semi-precious stones,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency ICRA.

“The moderation in the pace of contraction in merchandise imports to 8.8% in December 2019 from 12.7% in November 2019, was on account of oil imports (to -0.8% from -18.2%), driven by the YoY rise in the price of the Indian basket of crude oil. This trend is expected to sustain in January 2019,” said Nayar.

Exporters said they were awaiting a relief package in the February 1 Budget. “Exports continue to be in a dismal state, as global slowdown has started biting even more severely. Rising domestic inflation is bringing additional pressure and affecting our global competitive strength. Exporters are now pinning hope on budget for fiscal relief and ease of doing business,” said Ravi Sehgal, chairman EEPC India.

25,['16/01/2020'],"npr documents: Have Aadhaar, passport? You’ll have to share details for NPR","File photo

NEW DELHI: Sharing details of Aadhaar, passport number, voter ID and driving licence during the planned National Population Register ( NPR ) exercise will be mandatory if you possess these documents, home ministry sources clarified on Wednesday.A senior official explained “voluntary” or “optional” sharing of identification documents only meant respondents would not be required to provide details of Aadhaar, driving licence, voter ID or passport number if these have not been issued to them in the first place. But if one has the documents, the information is to be provided even though no document needs to be shown as proof.While announcing the Cabinet’s approval of funding for Census 2021 and NPR 2020 on December 24 last year, commerce minister Piyush Goyal had said sharing Aadhaar number during NPR would be “optional”. However, information & broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said NPR will involve self-certification or self-declaration while home minister Amit Shah said “voluntary” would mean it is okay if some information is not there.The official explanation on Wednesday cleared a prevailing impression that a respondent can choose not to provide information relating to the documents. While the effort will be to persuade respondents to provide information, explaining its utility, a rarely invoked provision entails a fine of up to Rs 1,000 on the head of the family for not sharing correct particulars of household members.An official explained the legal implications of “optional” and “compulsory”, saying, “It is indeed optional as the fields can be left blank if you don’t possess Aadhaar number, passport, driving licence or voter ID. ‘Compulsory’ would mean that you would be required to procure these documents to enter the said details in the NPR form.”According to sources, during the Census pre-test conducted last year, more than 80% respondents had willingly shared Aadhaar details. “The only field that got adverse response was PAN, which has been dropped,” said an officer.During NPR updation in 2015, around 50 crore respondents had furnished Aadhaar details.Rule 17 of the Citizenship Rules, 2003 does provide for a fine of up to Rs 1,000, though officials said the focus will be on getting the enumerator to motivate people to share the correct data by explaining how NPR data shapes development initiatives and ensures their inclusion as beneficiaries.Even for Census, the provision of a fine of up to Rs 1,000 and jail up to three years for intentionally giving false answers has never been invoked. Instead, participation is ensured by the enumerator doubling up as motivator. “Most enumerators are local school teachers or government staff and are known to the respondents. The confidentiality clause relating to the Census data gives confidence to respondents to share correct details,” said an officer.Asked if the NPR exercise would be affected by the opposition of some states, home ministry sources said the process had already been re-notified by all the states following the Centre’s 2019 notification. While the Registrar General of India has been informed of West Bengal and Kerala ’s decision to put the NPR process on hold, an officer said the two states have not announced doing way with NPR.“There is still time (for the states to review their positions). Meanwhile, training sessions for enumeration work are going on. The RGI wrote to the states two days ago asking them to intimate their respective 45-day schedule for the house-listing phase timed between April and September,” said the officer.States may ultimately realise that opting out of NPR would put them at a disadvantage in terms of targeting of development and entitlement schemes, noted an officer.Apart from Aadhaar etc, the 2020 NPR updation exercise will, for the first time, seek additional details such as date and place of birth of parents, place of last residence, mother tongue and mobile number.An officer said the field relating to members of household availing banking services, dropped from the Census house-listing schedule, will show up in the enumeration schedule to be notified later.This is the first time census and NPR data is being captured digitally via mobile applications. Enumerators capturing census, NPR and enumeration data on their mobile devices will be incentivised with a Rs 25,000 honorarium, as against Rs 5,500 being offered to those using paper forms.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73289662,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-951544,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/have-aadhaar-passport-youll-have-to-share-details-for-npr/articleshow/73283237.cms

27,['16/01/2020'],"SC faces deluge of letter petitions, device invented by it 40 years ago","This story is from January 16, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has been inundated by thousands of letter petitions, a device it improvised 40 years ago to unburden the poor in distress of litigation costs, sent by post by Muslims from across the country challenging the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The Chief Justice of India receives, on an average, 200 letters daily from various persons complaining of violation of fundamental rights, illegal action of authorities, personal cases, suffering at the hands of community leaders and even economic hardship because of crop failure. However, sources in the post office located on the SC premises confirmed to TOI that there had been an unusual surge in letters addressed to CJI S A Bobde since protests broke out against CAA.

Interestingly, when TOI perused some of the letters, it found bunches had been sent from Muslim localities. The typed letters were identical with the name and phone number of the petitioner scribbled at the end in the same handwriting. One such lot, containing nearly 50 letter petitions, came from Davangere in Karnataka . They started by quoting the Preamble of the Constitution and termed the CAA unconstitutional.

The Davangere bunch hints at a certain orchestration in the protest against CAA. “The aim of the CAA is to grant citizenship to religious minorities — naming specifically only Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jain, Parsis and Christians — fleeing persecution in Afghanistan , Bangladesh and Pakistan , who have entered India till December 31, 2014. But it does not extend the same protection to Muslims, including minority sects... Religion cannot be the basis for granting or depriving a person from acquiring Indian citizenship,” the letters said.

Sources in the SC’s PIL section told TOI that they had received around 10,000 such letters, majority of them questioning the validity of CAA, with some also extending the challenge to NPR and NRC. The unusual deluge has put the CJI’s office staff as well as the PIL section under strain with extra hours needed to process the mail.

In 1981, the SC had decided to treat deserving letters from the poor as PILs following in the footsteps of the US Supreme Court’s 1963 decision in Gideon vs Wainwright to treat a prisoner’s postcard as a petition.

But the purpose behind the 1981 decision appears to be lost in the present deluge. In the S P Gupta case, the SC had said, “Where a member of the public acting bona fide moves the court for enforcement of a fundamental right on behalf of a person or class of persons who on account of poverty or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position cannot approach the court for relief, such member of the public may move the court even by just writing a letter, because it would not be right or fair to expect a person acting pro bono publico to incur expenses out of his own pocket for going to a lawyer and preparing a regular writ petition for being filed in court for enforcement of the fundamental right of the poor and deprived sections of the community and in such a case, a letter addressed by him can legitimately be regarded as an ‘appropriate’ proceeding.”

One letter writer from Udaigiri, Mysuru, challenged the CAA on the same grounds as the Davangere bunch and said, “It was the first time ‘religion’ has been used as criteria for citizenship under Indian law... I strongly oppose and stand against such an unconstitutional law enacted by Parliament. Kindly take my PIL into consideration.”

Another by a Chennai-based woman termed the CAA as “fundamentally discriminatory” and said, “We heard repeatedly that this will be implemented along with NRC. We have seen the result of the NRC exercise in Assam , where about 19 lakh people are kept out of NRC and among them 14 to 15 lakh belong to Hindu communities. The exercise has been painful and affected people belonging to Dalits, tribals, OBCs, Muslims and other poor belonging to other communities.”

She added, “If the NRC and CAA (are) implemented together, then the people belonging to Hindu communities, even if unable to produce the required documents, will be declared refugees and will be given Indian citizenship. This means that the real burden will be only on Muslims to prove their citizenships. This will cause statelessness and hardships on Muslims, who have been living in India for thousands of years and majority of them are the original inhabitants of India.”

28,['16/01/2020'],"Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan to get out of jail, be under house arrest","This story is from January 16, 2020

Rakesh Wadhawan

MUMBAI: The father-son duo of Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan, directors in Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL), in judicial custody for their alleged role in triggering the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank collapse, will get to go home after three months—albeit with a rider. They will continue to be “in custody” with two guards each at their respective residences in Bandra (West), as directed by the Bombay high court on Wednesday.

This is to ensure they “cooperate” with a three-member committee, which will be set up under Justice (retd) S Radhakrishnan’s chairmanship, to evaluate and dispose of HDIL’s assets. The company owes Rs 4,635 crore to PMC Bank. The Wadhawans were arrested on October 3, 2019.

The high court directed the lower courts to not entertain any bail plea by Rakesh (68) and Sarang Wadhawan (42) till the next hearing on April 30, and asked the superintendent of Arthur Road jail, where they are lodged, to arrange for guards.

The guards have to ensure the Wadhawans are not taken beyond the high court’s jurisdiction. The father-son duo would also be permitted to travel for “ensuring the compliance of the directions of the committee and for assisting in the process of the sale”.

“We are conscious of the plight of lakhs of depositors who had deposited their hard-earned money and life’s (sic) savings in PMC Bank. Such extraordinary situations warrant extraordinary measures so as to ensure speedy recovery of the monies of respondents (Wadhawans),” said a bench of Justice Ranjit More and Justice Surendra Tavade in their judgment on a public interest litigation.

The Wadhawans will provide office space for the committee and also bear the cost for the staff and the guards. “The respondents (Wadhawans) are instrumental for the huge fraud perpetuated by them through HDIL and group companies,” the bench said.

The judges also passed detailed directions on how the committee would function: It would first identify the properties of the companies owned, controlled, managed or promoted by the Wadhwans that are mortgaged solely with PMC Bank. The bank would also give details of the list of depositors. “The amount realised from the sale would be made available for direct distribution to depositors in such a manner as may be devised by the committee,” it added.

If the amount is not sufficient to meet the bank’s dues, then the committee will dispose of the properties of the companies owned, promoted or mortgaged by Wadhawans. If there is further shortfall, then the committee will dispose of all the unencumbered properties of the companies owned, controlled or mortgaged by Wadhawans as well as their properties. “Respondents will ensure that no roadblocks are created in the smooth sale and distribution by the committee,” they added.

The judges said Wadhawans would be answerable to the committee and neglect on their part would be viewed seriously. The committee has to furnish a progress report by April 30 “while specifying the cooperation and efforts shown” by the Wadhawans “for monetising the assets for ensuring the expeditious repayment of dues” of the bank.

The PIL was filed by advocate Sarosh Damania for speedy recovery of the bank’s dues and urged for a retired high court or Supreme Court judge-headed committee as the “normal process” will take years to repay the depositors.

Wadhawans, in their reply, had told the court they have no objection to the sale of encumbered properties and submitted a list of their encumbered and unencumbered assets. The encumbered assets exclusively mortgaged with PMC Bank or along with other financial institutions, are valued at more than Rs 11,000 crore based on the ready reckoner value. Also, encumbered assets where PMC Bank has no charge but are mortgaged with other financial institutions are valued over Rs 6,000 crore. The unencumbered assets are valued at Rs 2,600 crore. They agreed to the constitution of a committee and urged for bail, saying the maximum punishment under Prevention of Money Laundering Act is seven years. The judges also noted that none of the parties, including ED and PMC Bank, had objected to the setting up of the committee.

29,['16/01/2020'],Sikhs to be counted as separate ethnic group in US census for first time,"This story is from January 16, 2020

WASHINGTON: For the first time, Sikhs in the US will be counted as a separate ethnic group in the 2020 census, an organisation of the minority community said on Tuesday, describing it as a milestone moment.

President of the Sikh Society of San Diego Baljeet Singh said the Sikh community's efforts have come to fruition.

""This has paved the way forward nationally not only for the Sikh community but also for other ethnicities in the United States ,"" he said.

Describing this as a milestone, the United Sikhs said that this will be the first time the minority group will be counted and coded in the decennial US Census.

A delegation of the United Sikhs has held several meetings with the US Census in the recent past with the last one being on January 6 in San Diego.

""It's clear that a separate code is needed to ensure an accurate count of Sikhs in the United States, recognising a unique identity,"" said US Census Deputy Director Ron Jarmin.

""Working with United Sikhs, we understand how this change affects the national Sikh community, leading us to add this code for the 2020 Census,"" said Shagufta Ahmed with the Census Bureau and Office of Management Budget.

According to the United Sikhs, the current estimates of Sikhs living in the US are at 10 lakhs.

Sikhs meet the criteria for representation in the US Census as a distinct ethnic group and have a distinct unified appearance, culture, language, food and history.

The United Sikhs has advocated for the separate coding for more than two decades and filed commentary with the US Federal Register advocating for Sikhs to be added as an ethnic group, in large part, so that action can be taken to address major Sikh issues such as bullying, intimidation and hate crimes against the community.

""With the 2020 census approaching, many historically undercoded communities will be at-risk for being under-counted and under-served,"" said Ruben Singh, United Sikhs Census Manager.

""We look forward to collaborating with our census partners and other Sikh organisations and institutions to address the unanticipated challenges of the 2020 Census,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the Sikh Coalition has partnered with the Census Bureau for the 2020 census.

This is because Sikhs have traditionally been a 'hard to count' population in the United States, said Satjeet Kaur, Sikh Coalition executive director.

""Our community matters, and we want to make sure that Sikh families are appropriately counted and accurately resourced wherever they are across our country,"" she said.

31,['16/01/2020'],"Raipur in SC, makes UPA-era NIA Act a Centre-state conflict","This story is from January 16, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Congress government in Chhattisgarh on Wednesday made the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, enacted by Parliament in 2008 during the Congress-led UPA government to investigate terror and other crimes having national consequence, a Centre-state dispute alleging that the counter-terrorism law was illegally usurping police powers of the state.

The trigger for filing the suit to take on the Centre under a federal structure appeared to be the NIA’s decision to take over certain Naxal-related criminal cases.

The Bhupesh Baghel government’s Article 131 petition, settled by senior advocate Vivek Tankha, said, “NIA Act, in its present form, not only takes away the power of conducting investigation by the state through its police but also confers unfettered discretionary and arbitrary powers on the Union government. There are no rules governing the exercise of power (by the Union home ministry) which gives ample discretion to the Centre to exercise its power at any juncture without providing any reason or justification for the same.”

The NIA Act was passed by Parliament on December 31, 2008, in the immediate aftermath of the 26/11 terror attacks on Mumbai in order to break the silos in which intelligence and law-enforcement agencies worked and to facilitate a seamless response to crimes against the country.

Then Union home minister P Chidambaram had introduced the NIA Bill in Lok Sabha in December 2008. In the statement of object and reasons for introducing the bill to create NIA, Chidambaram had told Parliament, “Over the past several years, India has been the victim of largescale terrorism sponsored from across the borders. There have been innumerable incidents of terrorist attacks, not only in the militancy and insurgency affected areas and areas affected by Left wing extremism, but also in the form of terrorist attacks and bomb blasts etc in various parts of the hinterland and major cities.”

He had further said, “A large number of such incidents are found to have complex inter-state and international linkages, and possible connection with other activities like the smuggling of arms and drugs, pushing in and circulation of fake Indian currency, infiltration from across the borders etc. Keeping all these in view, it has for long been felt that there is need for setting up an agency at the central level for investigation of offences related to terrorism and certain other acts, which have national ramifications.”

The trigger for Chhattisgarh filing the suit seeking declaration that NIA Act was unconstitutional was the NIA’s request seeking transfer to itself several Naxal-related violent incidents. The state police appears to have completed investigations into them and did not want the NIA to take over the probe.

Citing that investigation into any crime by the central agency CBI required consent of the state government, Chhattisgarh said, “Provisions of the NIA Act leave no room for coordination and pre-condition of consent, in any form whatsoever, to be sought by the Centre from the state government, which clearly repudiates the idea of state sovereignty as envisaged under the Constitution.

“The provisions of NIA Act are such that once brought into motion, it completely takes away the power of the state government to investigate the offences which have been categorised as scheduled offences under the NIA Act and which have been committed within the jurisdiction of the state. NIA Act is not only unconstitutional but is also against the federal spirit envisaged under our constitutional scheme wherein both Centre and state are considered to be independent in their respective jurisdictions.”

You might know soon.The ministry of science and technology will grade higher educational institutions and research institutes that it funds on gender equality from this academic year. While 20 institutes, including some Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology (NITs), have signed up to be part of the pilot, the grading system will eventually be rolled out across all institutes — over 90 — funded partially or fully by the ministry.The ratings — gold, silver and bronze — to STEM (science, tech, engineering, mathematics and medicine) institutes will be based on the number of women occupying science faculty positions in the institute, how well the institute recognises contributions by women scientists and the number of women fellows sent to Indian Academy of Sciences and Indian National Science Academy . Other parameters will include PhD awardees among women and how many women scientists returned after a sabbatical.While gold grade is for institutes where beacons of gender equality achievement and role models exist, silver grade is for those which have identified challenges and demonstrated impact. Bronze grade recognises institutes which are working to promote equality.“Our policy will initially include 20 institutes which will adopt a self-assessment process to develop an accreditation model to help identify gender gaps and barriers to progression faced by women in science based on interviews with them,” said Sanjay Mishra , head of KIRAN division at the department of science and technology (DST) which will give the ratings to institutions in collaboration with the British Council . The total budget of the project is Rs 8 crore, of which Rs 3 crore will be provided by the British Council.Explaining what they hope to achieve with this initiative, Mishra said, “Ratings like these will not only bring about a cultural and mindset change but also encourage top authorities like vice-chancellors and directors to take all possible action to recruit, retain and promote more women in the STEM sector.”“The project aims to engage, mentor, partner and support institutions as they work towards reaching the global best praxis for gender equality,” according to the DST policy, a copy of which is with TOI.“At present, a couple of IITs and some NITs have been included in the pilot. Later, we will grade other institutes with the ministry’s approval,” added Ashutosh Sharma , secretary, DST.The policy has been modelled after Athena SWAN (scientific women’s academic network), a charter that recognises and celebrates good practices in higher education and research institutions towards the advancement of gender equality in the UK.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73283923,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-406128,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/top-institutes-will-now-be-graded-on-gender-equality/articleshow/73283922.cms
33,['16/01/2020'],Your date with monsoon set to change with IMD’s fresh reference dates,"This story is from January 16, 2020

NEW DELHI: You may soon have new ‘normal’ dates for onset and withdrawal of monsoon rains as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) is set to change the reference dates for the south-west monsoon while making its forecast for the 2020 season in April.

Though the normal onset date of summer monsoon for Kerala may remain the same as June 1, the IMD will change the reference dates for some regions as also the dates for withdrawal. The withdrawal date from north-west India may be delayed by nearly 10 days. It means the normal withdrawal date of the monsoon from north-west India (north Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana) will be changed from September 1 to September 10.

“The IMD’s report is almost ready. We will implement it (new normal dates) from this year. It will not be changed for Kerala. But for other places, it’ll be changed. It’ll arrive early at few places and late at other places. Mostly, it’ll be late in central India. There will, however, not be a drastic change in arrival dates,” said Madhavan Rajeevan , secretary, ministry of earth sciences (MoES).

The central India division comprises 10 sub-divisions -- Chhattisgarh, Odisha , west Madhya Pradesh , east Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, central Maharashtra, Konkan and Goa, Gujarat region and Kutch and Saurashtra.

Arrival of monsoon in Kerala is considered as the onset date of monsoon for India even if it hits Andaman & Nicobar Islands a few days earlier.

India had been adhering to June 1 and September 1 as reference dates for onset and withdrawal of monsoon respectively ever since it was set in 1941. The four-month monsoon season is from June 1 to September 30.

The changes, based on analysis of historical data on changing rainfall pattern across the country, will help farmers, civic agencies, hydro-power plants and disaster management authorities in carrying out better planning of their works during the season.

Rajeevan, speaking on sidelines of the IMD’s 145th foundation day function here on Wednesday, noted that the marked change may be noticed in the ‘normal’ withdrawal date of monsoon from the north-west India. “It’ll be 10 days late,” he said.

Last year, the withdrawal of monsoon commenced on October 9 which was historically the most delayed withdrawal against the normal withdrawal date of September 1. Before 2019, the most delayed withdrawal was recorded in 1961 (October 1) followed by in 2007 (September 30).

The MoES secretary, however, did not specify whether climate change was behind the IMD’s move to change the ‘normal’ dates. He said the weather agency had noticed the changes in rainfall patterns over the year but did not revise the dates.

“It may not be climate change. It must be some systemic changes. I insisted that it should be brought out. We should not continue with the same climatology of 1940s to inform people about the monsoon rainfall,” said Rajeevan

Rajeevan said the IMD is also working on to predict “impact based forecast” in case of rainfall like what it did in the case of cyclone prediction where it even advised what the authorities were expected to do to minimise its impact.

Citing example of Uttarakhand floods of 2013, the MoES secretary said the IMD was satisfied with its prediction of heavy rainfall but it could not tell the authorities about its likely impact.

“Impact of heavy rainfall could be different for different cities or regions, depending on ground situation. Therefore, it is important to come out with an impact based forecast in case of heavy rainfalls or any other weather events,” said Rajeevan.

The changes will be the second such move by the IMD to bring a new benchmark as far as summer monsoon is concerned. Last year, the country got a new benchmark that categorises ‘status’ of its summer monsoon based on the amount of rains it gets compared to the ‘normal’ rainfall during June-September period.

This ‘normal’, derived as long period average (LPA) of 50 years, had been revised downward from 89 cm to 88 cm, reflecting decline in average rainfall in India.

36,['16/01/2020'],"Interested in diplomacy, but not in negotiating with US: Iran","This story is from January 16, 2020

NEW DELHI: Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif on Wednesday said Tehran was interested in diplomacy but not in negotiating with the US which had not kept its word, indicating the bitterness and chill between the two nations. Zarif also said the killing of Iranian general Qassim Suleimani showed ignorance and arrogance.

Addressing the Raisina Dialogue here, Zarif, who was recently denied permission to visit the UN in New York, said 430 Indian cities saw protests against Suleimani's killing in a US drone strike on January 3. Indian government sources, however, said a few demonstrations took place only in Lucknow and Kargil.

On tensions with the US, Zarif said, “We are interested in diplomacy. We are not interested in negotiating with the US. The US did not keep its commitments under the nuclear deal. We had a deal and the US broke it. If we have a Trump deal, how long will it last?”

Zarif met Prime Minister Narendra Modi later on Wednesday evening. According to an official readout, Modi reaffirmed India’s commitment to its relationship with Iran. “He thanked the Iranian leadership for progress in Chahbahar project, including through designating it as a special economic zone,” the government said. Zarif met NSA Ajit Doval and will meet his counterpart S Jaishankar on Thursday.

Accusing the US of “ignorance and arrogance”, Zarif, who made the most of the platform provided by the dialogue, said the US was fuelling “mayhem” in West Asia. However, US officials have stressed they had clear indications that Suleimani was planning attacks against American interests.

“Suleimani was the single biggest threat to the Islamic State, it is now celebrating his killing,"" Zarif said. ""The US didn't like Suleimani, although he was the single most effective force against the IS. If you don't believe me, see they are celebrating. Who are celebrating the death of Suleimani? Not ordinary people, but (Donald) Trump, (Mike) Pompeo and IS,"" he added.

Describing the shooting down of a Ukrainian airline as “unforgivable”, Zarif said, “The accidental shooting happened because there was a crisis. People made unforgivable mistakes.” Calling for a new coalition against IS, he said, “The current coalition used the basis of the coalition to kill the most effective anti-IS general.”

Zarif defended the resolution passed by the Iraqi parliament which sought removal of all foreign troops from Iraq. “The US hit two bases in Iraq to carry out operations in Iraq against an Iraqi guest. It was an unprovoked attack inside Iraq’s territory,” he said.

After the Europeans activated the dispute settlement mechanism of the Iranian nuclear deal, Zarif said he was uncertain the deal will survive at all. “It depends on Europe whether the deal will remain in place after the activation of the dispute resolution mechanism by France, Germany and the United Kingdom ,” he said.

37,['16/01/2020'],"Congress: Govt favouring Adani group for Rs 45,000 crore sub deal","This story is from January 16, 2020

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday alleged that the Modi government is looking to favour the Adani industrial group in a Rs 45,000 crore defence deal to manufacture submarines despite a negative opinion of the key Navy panel which decides on eligibility of bidders.

Addressing a press conference, AICC spokespersons Randeep Surjewala and Jaiveer Shergill said Navy received five responses to its offer for building six conventional submarines under Project 75-I.

“The offer of the joint venture of Adani Defence and Hindustan Shipyard Limited was rejected. Adani has no experience in manufacturing ships and submarines, and its only claim in favour of its bid was that it had experience in setting up and running power plants,” they said.

According to Congress, the “empowered committee” rejected Adani’s bid and on examination of manufacturing facilities, financial records and other criteria, it short-listed two entities – government-owned Mazagaon Dock Shipbuilders Limited and Larsen and Toubro .

“But the Central government and the defence ministry is now seeking to overrule the ‘empowered committee’ of Indian Navy by pressuring it to consider Adani defence. A decision is likely to be taken on Friday or Saturday,” Surjewala and Shergill claimed, calling it a case of “crony capitalism”.

Targeting the government, Surjewala said, “The Submarine Project 75-I is under a cloud of suspicion owing to allegations of favouritism, crony capitalism , violations of the DPP-2016 and an alleged over-ruling of Indian Navy and its empowered committee by the Narendra Modi government.”

“The government is flouting norms and the defence procurement procedure 2016 (DPP-2016) in awarding the contract to the Adani-HSL joint venture,” Surjewala said.

Congress alleged Adani has also flouted project norms. It said there was no official joint venture till the final closure of Expression of Interest on September 11, 2019, and the companies announced formation of a JV only on September 28. It cited media reports on company’s announcement of JV to back its claim.

“According to rules, the JV has to get the clearance from the Ministry of Defence. But it had not been taken at the time of submitting the EOI. The ‘credit rating’ has also been lowered to benefit the Adani JV. The norms say every entity bidding for a contract above Rs 1,000 crore should be categorised as ‘A’ but in this case it has been diluted to ‘BBB’,” Shergill alleged.

BHOPAL: A 29-year-old youth from Bhind district of Madhya Pradesh is in shock after being handed an income-tax notice and told to explain transactions of Rs 134 crore made on a business account opened with his PAN number in Mumbai in 2011-12. Ravi Gupta says he had a salary of Rs 7,000 in those days, has no idea how the account was opened, and believes it to be a case of money laundering , which should be probed.

He says an even bigger shock awaited him when he began his own investigation into the firm — it led him to a few steps from the offices of fugitive jeweller Mehul Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi, co-accused in the Rs 12,700-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud. Gupta alleged that the transactions were made by a Gujarat-based diamond trading company.

A senior I-T official said Gupta can file a complaint and seek a probe. Gupta, a resident of Bhind’s Mohana, has been told that transactions of Rs 134 crore were made in the account of the company with a private bank's branch in Mumbai between September 9, 2011, and February 13, 2012. The PAN card linked with this company belongs to Gupta.

“I was hardly 21 when these transactions were made. I had not been to Mumbai or Gujarat in 2011 or 2012. I was then working with a private firm in Indore, earning Rs 7,000 a month, which is non-taxable,” Gupta told TOI. “I have written to MP cyber cell, Maharashtra Police, PMO and I-T officers to clear me of this tax recovery case.”

He received the first tax notice on March 30, 2019, and told that his income for 2011-12 fiscal was taxable. “I ignored it since my salary that year was not taxable. Then, I got another one in July. Rattled, I began taking leave to conduct my own investigation. I started collecting details of the case,” said Gupta. He says he went to income-tax offices in Mumbai to tell them that he isn’t at fault and that the account was not his. “Now, the I-T department has threatened to attach my properties to recover the dues,” he said.

Gupta was summoned by I-T in December and told to bring account details, account opening form, PAN card, copy account verification form, service tax registration, TIN registration and firm registration in Gujarat. “I told them that I had nothing to do with the diamond company. The account had only my PAN card, that too with a forged signature. They should investigate how transactions of over Rs 100 crore were made from an account that didn’t have a local address,” Gupta said.

39,['16/01/2020'],RJD MLA: Nitish to form govt again,"This story is from January 16, 2020

PATNA: RJD MLA Faraz Fatmi on Wednesday created ripples in the political circles by saying that chief minister Nitish Kumar will return to power in the state. He also criticized RJD’s CM face Tejashwi Prasad Yadav for his proposed ‘Pratirodh Yatra’ In Seemanchal area from January 16 against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“When Nitish ji has already cleared his stand on the NRC by saying that it would not be implemented in Bihar, then what is the necessity of Tejashwi Yadav going to Seemanchal and begin a yatra on this sensitive and contentious issue,” the Keoti MLA said after attending a ‘Dahi-Chura' feast organized by JD(U)’s state president Bashishtha Narain Singh at his residence and attended by Nitish on the Makar Sankranti day on Wednesday.

Faraz’s statement assumes significance in an election year and indicated not only his inclination to join JD(U) led by Nitish but also the political churning going on among the legislators and leaders of different political parties, who will look for safer seat and side to swim through in the assembly polls due later this year.

When contacted, Faraz told TOI that even senior RJD leader like Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has said that Nitish will be the face in the 2020 assembly polls. “As of now in Bihar’s politics, Nitish is the biggest face compared to any other leader and he will form the next government,” said Faraz, whose father represented Darbhanga four times in Parliament.

RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said Faraz has not been participating in any party activities since his father MAA Fatmi left RJD and joined JD(U). When asked if RJD will expel him from the party, Gagan said, “He is free to leave RJD.”

Senior Fatmi had joined the JD(U) in July 2019 after breaking his almost 30 years’ long political ties with RJD and its chief Lalu Prasad. Fatmi, who was Union minister in UPA-1 government between 2004 and 2009, left RJD in April after denial of party symbol to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls either from Darbhanga or Madhubani in Bihar.

After quitting the RJD, he filed his nomination papers from Madhubani Lok Sabha seat as a BSP candidate, but withdrew his papers fearing split in opposition votes as Congress rebel Shakeel Ahmed was also in the fray.

42,['16/01/2020'],Old secretariat to get facelift before Jan 26,"This story is from January 16, 2020

PATNA: The state government has decided to renovate several heritage buildings in the city, including the old secretariat . As part of their beautification, their interiors have to be decorated and façades illuminated.

While the renovation work of the old secretariat is in full swing and is likely to be completed before January 26, other buildings like the Raj Bhavan will be beautified during the next few months.

Located in the east of the Raj Bhavan, the secretariat is one of the oldest buildings in the state capital. Apart from housing a number of important government departments, it also has offices of several ministers and bureaucrats. As part of its renovation work, the interior of the 100-year-old Victorian-style building has been decorated with old artefacts as well as paintings and its façade illuminated with lights of different colours and a digital flag on Republic Day and Independence Day.

“The old secretariat will be revamped before Republic Day. It is a great example of architectural brilliance and will be thrown open to common people soon. We want them to know about one of Bihar’s oldest and most prominent buildings as it showcases various aspects of our culture,” chief secretary Deepak Kumar told this newspaper on Tuesday.

Work on beautification of other heritage structures will begin once the old secretariat is renovated. “The city has numerous heritage buildings. We have planned to adorn them so that people understand their importance,” Kumar said.

An official of the state youth, art and culture department claimed that most prominent heritage sites in the city had been built in Greek, Roman and Renaissance styles during the 20th century. “Some of these include the Raj Bhavan, which was built in Renaissance style, and the Bihar Vidhan Mandal whose architecture was influenced by Greek and Roman cultures,” he added.

43,['16/01/2020'],Mahagathbandhan netas show bonhomie over feast,"This story is from January 16, 2020

PATNA: The Mahagathbandhan leaders showed solidarity over Dahi-Chura feast organized by state Congress president Madan Mohan Jha at Sadaquat Ashram on Makar Sankranti day on Wednesday. The opposition leaders not only tried to show bonhomie, but also lashed out at the Centre and state government, especially on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register for Citizen (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) issues.

Leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, said chief minister Nitish Kumar was not even following his party’s constitution and simply doing what BJP wanted. “He has delayed the discussion on CAA and is even ready for NPR, which is a first step towards NRC. He is doing all these things for personal greed,” said Tejashwi, who advised Nitish to form a human chain on issues like unemployment in the country.

Regarding Union home minister Amit Shah’s pro-CAA rally scheduled in Vaishali on Thursday, Tejashwi said the NDA had time and again tried to disturb peace, but could not succeed in Bihar as it is the land of Buddha. Even Congress state incharge Shaktisinh Gohil rapped at the central government over CAA and NPR and ignoring inflation and unemployment issues.

“Those who think that only Muslims will be affected by NPR are wrong. Poor will be the worst affected. How will they show the documents and birth certificate of their parents to prove citizenship. People should learn a lesson from Assam, where majority of those who failed to show the documents were actually non-Muslims,” said Gohil

“I know both PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah well. They trap a person by knowing his weaknesses and they have done the same with Nitish, who is not able to speak openly despite winning the last election with secular votes,” he added.

Meanwhile, Tejashwi made the other leaders wait for the delicacies for almost an hour as he reached the venue late. RLSP head Upendra Kushwaha, HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi and VIP founder Mukesh Sahni reached Sadaquat Ashram by 12:30pm, but Tejashwi reached around 1:30pm.

While talking to media before the feast, Manjhi once again said the CM candidate will be decided by the Mahagathbandhan coordination committee. He also said his party will remain firm on its previous demand of making one chief minister and two deputy chief ministers and one each should be from Scheduled Caste, minority and extremely backward caste. Also, one of these should be a woman.

45,['16/01/2020'],Jeff Bezos tries to win over traders,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (Photo: ANI)

NEW DELHI: On a nippy Wednesday morning, traffic snarls near Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in the capital triggered angry expletives from drivers, who were stranded staring at a huge orange balloon soaring against the skyline with Amazon emblazoned all over it.

Small traders, who had threatened to greet Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with vociferous protests for allegedly taking away their business, were nowhere to be seen. Only hundreds of small entrepreneurs, who had coughed up Rs 4,000 to attend a two-day event by the US retailer, stood in serpentine queues leading up to gate number 20.

Some took to social media to vent their ire. “Suited professionals are standing on dusty roads in a long-long queue to register for a paid event. It’s not a free event which entitles Amazon to treat professionals like garbage,” said a seller.

But once inside the smallish auditorium, the expectation of seeing the world’s richest man on stage, turned frustration into excitement. Neither tedious Amazon ads playing on loop, nor a one-and-half hour delay in starting proceedings dampened their spirits. Only Infosys founder Narayana Murthy made his displeasure felt as he abruptly cut short his speech. “I was supposed to speak for 20 minutes but will try and finish it in five minutes because I am not used to delays,” he said, rather tersely.

Bezos’ entrance was preceded by the arrival of his personal bodyguards, who appeared to have been picked straight from the US Secret Service. While they flanked the stage to face the crowd, the flamboyant 56-year-old entrepreneur strolled in to join other senior Amazon executives, in a printed blue Nehru jacket sourced impromptu from a local vendor at the venue. The excitement inside the packed hall was palpable.

Chatting with Amazon India head Amit Agarwal, Bezos spoke about the impact of climate change, the need to create space entrepreneurs, his childhood fantasies, failures and the potential of India on the global stage.

The Amazon boss also made a distinction between different kinds of failures. Some experiments are high-quality failures, he said. “Innovation is about maximising the rate of experimentation,” Bezos said, “Then there is operational excellence failure that you should try to avoid. When you know how to do something, you have to treat that differently.”

Speaking about the aspirations of his space company, Blue Origin, Bezos said, “I want Blue Origin to reduce the cost of access to space by such a large magnitude that we can have two kids in a dorm room start a great space company.”

While the overawed audience, which consisted mainly of small entrepreneurs, broke into a thunderous applause at Bezos’s tips on achieving success, street food vendors outside the venue took the cue and hiked the price of a tiny plate of bhel puri by at least Rs 40.

The billionaire e-commerce tycoon wore Indian attire — topped by a Nehru jacket — and took to flying kites with children as part of his charm offensive leading the US retail giant’s fresh bid of garnering a larger share in one of the most lucrative markets in the world.

PATNA: The chancellor ’s secretariat has directed the universities to organize as many as 16 co-curricular and extra-curricular programmes during the next six months with a view to improving the academic atmosphere in colleges and university department and encouraging the students to take part in sports and cultural activities.

Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU) has been asked to organize a three-day inter-university sports meet ‘Eklavya’ from February 6 to 8. All the universities in the state would send their athletics teams in this competition and the winners would be awarded prizes. An inter-university cultural festival was organized by Patliputra University in the first week of December.

L N Mithila University (LNMU) will organize a workshop on ‘NAAC accreditation’ at Darbhanga in January itself. This workshop holds great significance as a large number of educational institutions are yet to be accreditated by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and, hence, they are being deprived of financial grants from the UGC and other funding agencies. Besides, the workshop would also train the institutions in making necessary preparations for assessment and scoring better grades following their accreditation.

Recently, the self-study reports submitted by more than a dozen colleges of different universities, including Patna and Patliputra universities, were not accepted by NAAC as they were not properly filled in. NAAC accreditation has now become mandatory for all the institutions of higher education in the country and no institution would get any financial aid from any agencies unless it is accreditated, said sources.

Jayaprakash University, Chhapra, has been asked to organize a quiz competition for students on ‘Role of Mahatma Gandhi in India’s freedom movement’ during the current month itself. Bihar Agricultural University, Sabour, will organize an agricultural exhibition in February and Munger University will organize an exhibition on the latest scientific techniques and equipment.

Patna University will organize a workshop on revision of three-year degree courses as per the UGC-NET syllabi. Universities in Bihar are also preparing for introducing semester system and choice based credit system (CBCS) at the undergraduate level from the next academic session. The universities have already adopted CBCS at the postgraduate level following a uniform ordinance assented to by the chancellor, sources added.

Besides, Raj Bhavan has directed all the universities to organize workshops, seminars and conferences at regular intervals.

Protesters enjoy a patishapta or two at Park Circus Maidan on Wednesday

KOLKATA: On the occasion of Makar Sankranti , a citi-zens’ group distributed patisapta among the women at the sit-in at Park Circus Maidan .

Mahasweta Samajdar, one of the members of the group, said, “In every Bengali household, we make pithe with rice flour, coconut, milk and khejur gur on this day and distribute it among friends and relatives. We thought of celebrating this year’s Makar Sankranti with the feisty women of Park Circus who are fighting this battle against NRC, CAA and NPR for all of us.”

Around 200 women and children were present at the maidan when members of the citizens’ group, Sohomon, arrived with packets of pithe. They interacted with them and spoke about the festival and how Bengalis celebrate it in their homes. After the brief interaction, the members of the group started distributing the patishapta to the burkha-clad women sitting in protest against NRC, CAA and NPR.

Topsia resident Tabassum Gulab, who has been coming to Park Circus every day got to taste patishapta for the first time. “I liked the sweet, as well as the gesture of the people who brought it for us. We want to live together peacefully, celebrating each other’s festival for generations to come,” she said.

Fabiha Ahmed, a Class III student who came with her mother, was seen relishing the dish. It was her first experience of tasting a traditional Bengali sweet.

Thakurpukur resident Razia Mondol, who joined the sit-in demonstration on Wednesday, described the initiative as “heartwarming and thoughtful”. She said, “This act shows that no one can divide us in the name of religion. This movement has strengthened the bond between Hindus and Muslims and given us a chance to know each other’s festivals and customs more thoroughly,” she said.

Sumaan Sengupta, another member of Sohomon, said, “It is important to know each other and take part in each other’s festivals to br-idge the differences between us, which are being used to create the chasm among communities. The initiative was taken to send out a message of inclusiveness and peace-ful coexistence.”

Uzma Alam, a homemaker, said, “It is good to see people from different religions coming here to celebrate their festivals. The unseen barrier between communities are finally melting as this is the need of the hour.”

Md Ataullah Khan, a resident of Park Circus, felt this act upheld the secular tenets of the country.

48,['16/01/2020'],Raghuvansh Prasad Singh flays ‘slip’ system under new RJD state president,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Raghuvansh Prasad Singh

PATNA: Jagdanand Singh, a Rajput, was made the RJD’s state president to woo his caste voters, but his fellow caste man and senior party leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh is frequently attacking the former over his style of functioning and defeating the purpose of party chief Lalu Prasad behind appointing a forward caste leader as the state unit head.

Raghuvansh went to the extent of comparing Jagdanand’s style of functioning with that of Nazy leader Hitler. “Office gate remains closed and people have to send a slip to meet him (Jagdanand). There is a purza (slip) system now. These things are against the functioning of RJD, which is a party of the poor. He talks of discipline, but that does not mean slavery,” Raghuvansh told TOI on Wednesday.

A party worker associated with the RJD office said after taking the charge of state president, Jagdanand brought many changes to focus on discipline. “Now vehicles are not allowed to be parked inside the office campus. Earlier, any worker could enter the campus and park his vehicle wherever he felt. Since the campus is not huge, it led to chaos. But now the main gate remains closed and even state president gets down from his car outside and walks to the office. Also, people are not allowed to simply sit and waste time inside the office campus. This has irked many who have complained to Raghuvansh Babu,” he said.

Raghuvansh has also written a letter to Lalu while criticizing Jagdanand’s style of functioning. He mentioned in his letter about lack of party’s preparedness to face the assembly election as the committees at different levels had not been formed even after a month of organizational election and just 300 days left for the assembly election.

However, Jagdanand avoids confronting Raghuvansh. He had earlier told TOI that every party member had a right to express his view in a democracy.

A senior party leader said it was a clash of ego between the two Rajput leaders. “Both are senior leaders and close to Lalu ji, who had once kept one in Delhi (Raghuvansh) and another in the state (Jagdanand). But today the situation has changed and Raghuvansh Babu feels sidelined as he thinks Tejashwi is more inclined towards Jagdanand,” he said.

Another party leader added, “This is not for the first time that Raghuvansh Babu is criticizing anyone or pointing out the mistakes in the party publicly. Even while sharing the dais with Lalu ji, he had done so. He had even criticised the functioning of former RJD state president Ram Chandra Purbey. He is a socialist and this is how most of them function.”

50,['16/01/2020'],"Experts back Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on porn ban, call for sex education in schools","This story is from January 16, 2020

Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Experts in city have hailed CM Nitish Kumar’s call for a ban on pornography , which, they believe, is one of the major causes for rise in cases of sexual assaults on women.

“Sexually explicit videos, photos, audios and games trigger brain cells, which incite the culprits to commit rapes and other forms of violence against women. Pornography also has extremely troubling effects on the mental and physical health of people from all age groups, including children,” they said.

Nodal officer and associate professor of NMCH de-addiction centre, Santosh Kumar, said watching porn is as addictive and dangerous as taking drugs. “Porn has such bad effects on people, especially adolescents, that it hinders their mental and physical health,” he said.

Kumar added, “Explicit contents available on the internet disrupt their ability to differentiate between good and bad. Contents shown on porn websites lack empathy. Children become stubborn and heartless after watching videos of rape and sexual assaults. Thereafter, they tend to commit crimes like rapes.”

He said people commit such crimes due to lack of sex education as well. “Ban on porn will definitely minimize cases of sexual harassment, but it won’t stop the crime. The only thing that can stop it is education. Teachers as well as parents should start giving sex education to children from a very young age,” said Kumar.

Binda Singh, a clinical psychologist, also said parents should start educating their children from young age. “Hiding or making sex look like taboo will only increase their curiosity,” she said, adding schools should organise awareness campaigns and hire experts to give sex education to children.

Teachers too said sex education should be made compulsory in schools. “Almost every year, I find a group of young children watching porn in the classroom in the absence of teacher. I have also caught children of Class III watching such videos. They find it extraordinary and unusual,” said Alka, a teacher.

Parents, on the other hand, said schools should start teaching children in the traditional way. “These days children get their homework on WhatsApp. Even if we try to keep them away from internet and social media, we cannot,” said Rajesh Tiwari, a resident of Bailey Road.

On culprits blackmailing victims by making their videos viral, experts said social stigma and people’s mentality play an important role in this. “Psychopaths blackmail victims by making their sexually explicit videos. The victims avoid sharing it even with people closer to them fearing backlash in society,” Binda added.

Such incidents, especially during the National Road Safety Week, show the enforcement agencies in very poor light.

All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna (File photo)

PATNA: The All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) on Wednesday felicitated 10 persons who lost their limbs after undergoing amputation during treatment there after road accidents. It was a part of the road safety week being organised by the institute.

Altogether 25 persons of different places, who met with accidents and had to undergo amputation at AIIMS-P in the last one and a half years were invited for felicitation, but only ten turned up.

Speaking to these road accident victims, AIIMS-P director Dr PK Singh encouraged them to have confidence and lead a normal life. He said everyone needed to be aware of traffic rules and cautious while driving or walking on roads as even a minor mistake could cost someone his or her life.

Head of the trauma and emergency department, Dr Anil Kumar, said out of about 1300 road accident victims who were treated at the AIIMS-P till date, 25 suffered loss of one or more limbs. “In accident cases, time and severity matter a lot. The first four hours are golden hours for survival and effective treatment of those having vascular injuries as delay in reaching a hospital may worsen the case,” he said.

The AIIMS-P trauma department requested the transport secretary cum divisional commissioner of Patna to help in providing artificial limbs to these accident survivors for making their life more self-dependent, said Anil.

Among those felicitated was a six-year-old girl Shipra of Muzaffarpur. She had met with an accident while playing in front of her school and lost both her limbs above the knees. Talking to doctors, her mother said every school must keep watch when children go for outdoor games.

Dharmendra of Patna, who lost his lower limbs in an accident while driving a bike without helmet, thanked the AIIMS-P for saving his life. “Taking a lesson from the accident, I advise bikers never to step out on the road without helmet,” he said.

Others felicitated on the occasion included Rajendra Sharma of Gopalganj, Rajendra of Khagaria, Rajesh Pundit of Fatuha, Kallu Pawan, Tau and Santosh Kumar.

PATNA: The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is gearing up to begin commercial flights from the Darbhanga airbase as the construction work on the terminal building and re-carpeting of the air strip is now in the final stage and is expected to be ready by March.

According to AAI sources in Patna, final touches are being given to the civil enclave, which can accommodate 200 passengers at peak hour. “Flight operations at Darbhanga airbase will likely begin in next couple of months after all arrangements are put in place,” sources said. The flight operations were earlier scheduled to begin in December, 2019.

Darbhanga will be the first airport in Bihar under the Centre’s ambitious UDAN scheme aimed at improving regional connectivity.

Patna airport director Bhupesh CH Negi told this newspaper that Darbhanga airbase is ready for commercial flights and two more months are need to arrange for basic passenger amenities at the civil enclave. “The bidding process for the required facilities to run the commercial airport has been completed,” Negi said.

“Basic facilities such as ticket counters, CCTV cameras, help desk, installation of baggage X-ray machine, check-in and boarding counters, arrival and departure display boards, signage and transit parking among others, are yet to be put in place,” Negi said.

He added: “The airport operations would be handled by the AAI and the security will be provided by the state government.”

Around 70 security personnel were trained to manage passengers in Patna last month. The training session was conducted by the Bureau of Civil Aviation.

The 15,000sq feet terminal building has been built at an estimated cost of Rs 92 crore. There will be six check-in counters and two aprons. The foundation for the civil enclave at Darbhanga was laid by chief minister Nitish Kumar on December 24, 2018.

Private airline SpiceJet has been selected to operate under the UDAN scheme. It will operate three flights connecting Darbhanga to Bengaluru, New Delhi and Mumbai.

Once the flight operations begin, it will benefit northern Bihar districts, including Madhubani, Samastipur, Muzaffarpur, Begusarai, Bhagalpur, Jamui, Khagaria, Lakhisarai, Madhepura, Saharsa, Sheohar, Sitamarhi and Supaul, among other areas.

Darbhanga airbase will be the state’s third airport operating commercial flights. The state government has allotted Rs 121 crore to acquire 31 acres at Ranipur-Bihatwara area for construction of a new terminal building, cargo, parking space and other auxiliary facilities.

Kochi: State government should take action against the engineers responsible for the maintenance of the road stretch at Palariavttom where a youth died in December, the high court directed on Wednesday.

Justice Devan Ramachandran issued the directive while considering a petition (WP-C No. 32680/2008) filed by C P Ajithkumar through advocate Tom K Thomas highlighting the bad condition of roads in Kochi. Yadu Lal, who was riding a motorcycle, had died when he was run over by a truck after falling off the bike when it fell into a pit.

In the interim order issued on Wednesday, the court said, “As regards the accident at Palarivattom on 12.12.2019 is concerned, this court certainly requires the government to place on record the nature of action that they propose, particularly with respect to the personal responsibility to be fixed on the concerned engineers and officials, who are in charge of the road concerned, since it is without doubt that, going by the judgment of this court in this writ petition, such action is imperative, which will act as a deterrent in future to any casual or lackadaisical conduct by such authorities.” tnn

Surat: If all goes as planned , the Diamond City will soon have air connectivity with tier-II cities like Indore, Nanded and Jalgaon.

A private airline company, TrueJet is planning to connect Surat with the tier-II cities following representation from Navsari MP C R Paatil. The company is likely to start the flight services by the end of February.

Paatil told TOI: “I had a meeting with the top management of TrueJet company for connecting Surat with Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The company has shown its willingness to connect Surat with Indore, Nanded and Jalgaon.”

According to Paatil, the company has started survey of potential traffic to these three cities and is very positive on the success of the operation. The company will be offering attractive travel fares to tap the passengers wanting to travel to these locations.

Sources said that TrueJet is already providing regional air connectivity to the cities like Ahmedabad, Goa, Mysore, Vijaywada, Salem, Hyderabad, Tirupati, Aurangabad, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kandla. Surat has been selected for the routes including Nanded, Jalgaon and Indore.

At present, the Surat airport is connected with major cities in the country including Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Jaipur, Goa and Kolkata. There are around 20 flight operations in a day, catering to more than 3,500 passengers.

Atul Gupta, owner of Shri Rani Sati Travels, said, “There is a huge potential of air travel from Surat to Nanded, Jalgaon and Indore. There is a large chunk of passengers who would prefer travelling by air to these locations than going by the train. The major benefit will come from the textile sector and other industries located in and around Surat and south Gujarat.”

Gupta added, “We are helping the airline company in the survey of the passenger traffic and they are quite happy. Nanded and Jalgaon are very important destinations for Surat for business, religious tourism and otherwise. Also, there is very less train connectivity in all these destinations and that the airline company will be able to tap the business.”

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (File photo)

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: Mounting concerns of small traders prompted government officials to give visiting Amazon boss Jeff Bezos a miss.

Although Bezos, who is among the richest men, landed in the capital on Tuesday and spent the better part of Wednesday in Delhi, he limited the scope of his second trip to India after over five years to meeting businessmen, merchants, and the film industry.

Government sources said that ministers in the Narendra Modi Cabinet did not show much inclination in meeting Bezos given the recent anti-trust probe announced into Amazon India as well as allegations of the company not complying with foreign investment rules in letter and spirit.

With Delhi elections less than a month away, the BJP government may have opted to avoid the retail giant, which is often accused of destroying small businesses.

While an Amazon spokesperson did not respond to TOI’s queries, sources close to Amazon India played down the issue, saying Bezos did not ask for meetings with government officials even though various reports earlier this month said he may meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit. Bezos had met Modi during his last official visit in October 2014 and then in June 2016 when Modi visited the US, when Amazon announced plans to increase India investments from $2 billion to $5 billion.

His visit comes as the Competition Commission of India (CCI) is probing Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart over exclusive arrangements, giving preference to a few sellers, promoting private labels and deep discounts.

During the Delhi leg of his trip, Bezos addressed small businesses, flew a kite with kids to celebrate Makar Sankranti and then also chaired a review of the India business.

On Thursday, he is expected to be in Mumbai, where he will attend a Prime Video event with Bollywood celebrities like Shah Rukh Khan and A R Rahman, besides visiting some Amazon sellers and partners in the city.

On Friday, he is expected to meet corporate leaders including Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries, which has recently launched a competing marketplace JioMart, besides Future Group’s Kishore Biyani and others.

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Troubled lender Yes Bank has appointed IDFC Securities as an adviser for raising funds and also to bring in a strategic investor.

On Tuesday, the bank had informed the bourses that it has called for an extraordinary meeting of its shareholders to approve fund-raising of up to Rs 10,000 crore through one or more ways, including institutional placements, rights offer, preferential allotment, offer of convertible bonds and debentures.

IDFC Securities, which was recently purchased by Dharmesh Mehta — who was formerly with Enam Group and Axis Bank, has, along with some other reputed investors, bagged the mandate to advise the bank during its fund-raising process. It will also look at bringing in strategic advisers, sources said.

Lately, names of a host of individual and institutional investors, some even with dubious reputations, were floating around for rescuing the troubled lender. However, none of them finally came ahead to infuse any serious money in the bank.

Uncertainty about Yes Bank’s fund raising, crucial for it to meet regulatory requirements, has taken a toll on its stock price in the past few days. The bank on Wednesday said there were baseless rumours on it not meeting capital adequacy ratio and it was on course to raise funds.From a high of Rs 48 on January 9, the stock on Tuesday had fallen to Rs 37 level only to rise 3% on Wednesday to close at Rs 40. The clarification by the bank came after the close of trading.

59,['16/01/2020'],Aurangabad: Forest officials fiddle as nylon manja continues to harm birds,"This story is from January 16, 2020

The forest department is doing nothing to curb the illegal sale of nylon and glass-coated manja in the city

AURANGABAD: Even with more powers than police, the forest department is doing nothing to curb the illegal sale of nylon and glass-coated manja in the city and state while birds continue to suffer from injuries.

Traditionally, only the police have been carrying out crackdowns on such vendors, who are often invoked with various sections of Indian Penal Code and CrPc. The forest department, on the other hand, can book an offender through various section of the Environment Protection Act 1986, Prevention of Cruelty of Animal Act 1960 and Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972. Notably, the responsibility of ensuring necessary compliance with all these legislations falls on the shoulder of the Forest department.

For records, the Maharashtra government introduced the ban on such threads in June 2015 while the National Green Tribunal had declared a country-wide ban on these manjas almost two-years later in July 2017. The Maharashtra government had also invoked section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 to introduce the ban in question and the forest department has a key role to play in the implementation of the said legislation in a letter and spirit.

Several birds have been found injured due to the banned nylon manja and synthetic manjas being used for kite flyers during the ongoing Makara Sankranti festival.

Bird-expert Kishor Pathak said every year at least 200 birds receive injuries due to banned threads used for the kite flying in the city of Aurangabad , which is known for having more penchant for the kites. “Even if the festival of Sankranti is observed on only one day, revelers indulge in the kite flying for at least a total couple of months. These dangerous threads remain tangled on branches of different trees which serve as the dwelling for the feathery-creatures. Many birds get trapped and injured by banned manjas throughout the year and some of them die eventually,” he said.

Pathak said that the Forest department must deal with the banned manja vendors with stringent norms. “Going by the ruling of the NGT, the Forest department has more onus that the police to curb the sale of banned threads. The police have a limited legal framework, but the Forest authorities have multiple laws at their dispense to deal with the issue effectively,” he said.

Besides birds, the banned manjas are also posing a huge potential to humans. It may be recalled that a 26-year-old woman Ayurvedic doctor Krupali Nikam was killed after her throat was slit by manja at Kasarwadi area of Pune during October 2018.

Chief Conservator of Forest P K Mahajan said he would go into the details of NGT order concerned. “We have legal limitations in carrying out the stock verification and the same can be done by the police or revenue officials effectively. Still, we will study the NGT order carefully and decide the future course of action,” he said.

State higher education director Rekha Kumari asked the VC to send a proposal to state government for implementation of ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali’ programme in all PPU colleges.

Senate member Bijendra Kumar raised the issue of faculty crunch in Bikram college. The VC said guest teachers selected by the university would be sent to all colleges facing faculty shortage. Senate member Shyam Patel demanded PPU students’ union election at the earliest. The VC said the university would seek a directive from Raj Bhavan in this connection.

While senate member Radhe Syham raised the issues related to registration of PhD scholars for the session 2017-19 and availability of adequate number of books in the university library, PPU teachers’ association president Prof A K Singh Thakur welcomed the VC’s announcement to ensure payment of three months’ salaries to teaching and non-teaching staff in the revised payscales by the end of this month.

Kolkata: Cops probing a complaint lodged by a Jadavpur University student and her friend, who were allegedly beaten up by BJP supporters during the party’s street-corner meeting in Bikramgarh on Tuesday night, have registered two separate FIRs against the accused and booked them under multiple IPC sections, including non-bailable ones dealing with molestation.

“We have started a probe into the complaint. We recorded statements of the victims and took them to the incident spot on Tuesday night itself in order to identify the accused. However, none was found there. The complainants, too, haven’t mentioned any particular person. However, we are speaking to local residents and other witnesses to establish the offenders’ identities,” said an officer.

According to the complaint, around 9pm on Tuesday, the two friends — a second-year sociology student of Jadavpur University and a 26-year-old professional musician — were allegedly walking past a BJP street-corner meeting near Bikramgarh market when an altercation broke out between the two and the party workers.

“We were walking past the meeting when we heard the man on the dais speak foul against Jadavpur University students and the entire movement against CAA and NRC led by the students. We were angered by the comments but we didn’t say anything to them. We spoke among ourselves and criticised the speech. However, some in the crowd overheard us and after we had crossed the meeting venue, a group of 40-odd men came running from the meeting and blocked us,” said the musician, adding that he could identify some of the attackers by their faces, but didn’t know their names.

The couple allegedly tried to reason with the men, but they allegedly called the duo “naxals” and began assaulting them. “They hit my friend and, when I tried to stop them, they also assaulted me. They cornered us and began calling more people till a local shopkeeper came to our rescue and moved us out of the area. The entire situation was scary and I am suffering from a sense of insecurity and want the men to be arrested,” said the woman.

A day after the incident, students of Jadavpur University organized a protest rally from the University’s Gate 4 till the Bikramgarh market. “Both of us have been regular faces in all the anti-NRC and anti-CAA rallies in the recent past and we believe it was an organized attack because of that,” said the musician.

Meanwhile, senior BJP leaders said they will cooperate with the investigating agency in the particular case, but none of the local leaders who had organized the meeting responded to repeated calls made by the newspaper. “There are a few people who are trying to instigate BJP workers. But we do not support any violence. Let law take its course and our leaders will cooperate with the investigating authority,” said BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu.

MUMBAI: MSEDCL , which supplies power to Bhandup, Mulund, Thane, Navi Mumbai and the rest of the state, has proposed a 5-8% tariff hike for up to 300 units of consumption. This would be the costliest power tariff in the state. There will be no hike in tariff for high-end domestic users of above 300 units, but it will still be the highest among all power utilities in the state.Last week, BEST proposed the cheapest power tariff for its domestic consumers despite a hike, followed by Tata Power while Adani Electricity proposed a dip in its.The latest MSEDCL petition has offered sops to industry as it proposed just 1% hike in electricity every year for the next five years while commercial establishments, including shops and traders, will face no tariff hikes. This is being done in a bid to woo industries and ensure they do not migrate out of Maharashtra.For residential consumers with a monthly consumption of less than 100 units, 8% hike in tariff was proposed from Rs 3.05 per unit to Rs 3.30. For those in the 101-300 unit consumption category, a 5% hike was proposed from Rs 6.95 to Rs 7.30. For high-end residential users, there was a “zero” hike for 301-500 units for five years at a stretch and for above 500 units consumption, none for three financial years and a marginal hike of 1% for the next two years.“We have to pay huge electricity bills despite the fact that the power utility firm is being run by the state whereas private operators offer cheaper rates in Mumbai,” said Sharmistha Mitra, a Vashi resident. “The sad part is we do not have any alternative to switch over to another supplier unlike in the island city where there is Tata Power and BEST and in the suburbs where there is a healthy competition between Adani Electricity and Tata,” she said.A few activists had warned if MSEDCL continued to hike tariffs , it may compel industries to shift out of Maharashtra. A senior government official has rubbished this saying as per the latest tariff petition, the overall hike in the industry tariff was proposed from Rs 7.07 to Rs 7.11 per unit — or just 0.5% for 2020-21.

Officials said the motive is to provide services, including application for issuing documents related to residence, caste, old age pension, widow pension among others, apart from routine works such as delivering letters, mails, accepting deposits under small savings schemes, providing life insurance cover under Postal Life Insurance (PLI) and Rural Postal Life Insurance (RPLI).

Arvind Kumar Singh, postal superintendent of Bhagalpur division, said the one-stop CSC would start functioning by March 31. “People in rural areas at times feel harassed, while running from office to office to seek various certificates and avail services. Our endeavour is to provide various possible services under one roof to the customers,” he said.

Singh said the postal officers and staff would be trained to understand the procedures and work assigned to CSC. “A nodal officer in the rank of associate postal director will be made overall incharge of the CSC, whereas master trainer will look after the working of the CSC,” he said.

He said the CSC would not only cater to customers but also unburden government departments from the additional works. “The post offices have already started banking services, besides providing ATMs, credit and debit card facilities,” he said.

Its daily bulletin stated that weather remained dry across the state during the last 24 hours, while dense fog was observed in West Champaran, East Champaran, Gopalganj, Siwan and Saran areas. “Cold day condition was observed at few places over Bihar during the last 24 hours. The minimum temperature in Patna was recorded at 9.4 degree Celsius and maximum was 20.7 degree C on Wednesday,”” the bulletin said.

Sabour had the maximum and minimum temperatures at 22.4 and 6.6 degree Celsius on Wednesday.

The cyclonic circulation, which brought snow and rainfall in northern plains are now positioned near Madhya Pradesh and adjoining east Uttar Pradesh. It would affect several parts of Bihar between January 16 and 19. Its eastward movement will bring northwesterly wind and extend the fog cover over Bihar.

Hyderabad: Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy on Thursday pulled up railway officials and Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel after he found the door frame metal detector at Secunderabad railway station to be defunct.

Kishan Reddy was at the Secunderabad station to catch a train to a municipality as part of BJP municipal elections campaign.

Kishan Reddy was on his way to Bellampalli, Narsapur, Godavarikhani and Ramagundam municipalities.

SCR principal chief security commissioner GM Eswara Rao told TOI, “The door frame metal detector is supposed to beep when a passenger walks in with a metal item. It was not working when minister Kishan Reddy came to the station due to a technical issue. We have replaced it. We have also asked for more door frame metal detectors.”

Secunderabad railway station handles around 1.25 lakh passengers during festive season.

“We will be deploying additional forces from Railway Protection Special Force (RPSF). Currently, the RPF is short-staffed. We have sought 780 new personnel for RPF and they are undergoing training. There will soon be greater security at the railway stations and platforms. To temporarily sort out the problem, we are roping in special forces,” said Eswara Rao.

A member of an anti-terror cop squad said, “Secunderabad was on Lashkar-e-Toiba’s hit list. During Sankranti, there is huge rush of passengers. RPF and Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel shall ensure the safety and security of passengers.”

KOLKATA: The city turning into the epicentre of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), besides Delhi, has posed a new challenge for Kolkata Police . With multiple protests being lined up at a very short notice across multiple locations every day, the cops are getting just a few hours to prepare themselves. What’s worse, some of the prominent anti-establishment faces in the country, like former JNU leader Umar Khalid, psephologist and Swaraj Abhiyan founder Yogendra Yadav, Jamia student Ayesha Renna and ex-IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan, are regularly coming to Kolkata, keeping cops on their toes.

The cops are now walking the extra mile to collect information — consulting the protesters themselves, keeping tabs on social media and connecting with campus representatives. “The calls for permission are coming in really late. On certain occasions, they are merely being mailed to divisional DCPs or Lalbazar with intimation that the protest would be organized later in the day,” said an officer.

Cops said that with several protests lined up from Thursday — including a gathering of Jamia and Aligarh University students at JU and central Kolkata — Lalbazar has decided to set up an SOP to be followed for all short-notice protests.

All divisions have been provided with extra forces, a few police stations close to the protest sites have been asked to pitch in whenever required and OCs and additional OCs have been asked to help neighbouring police stations whenever required. For example, at the Bikramgarh Market protests organized on Wednesday by JU students, at least four different police stations were asked to pitch in. The police have advised people to follow the last-minute changes in traffic flow. “We have adopted a practical model. We want to stop traffic only when a rally reaches close to that spot. There is also an effort to keep at least one flank open,” an officer said.

Reserved battalions have been posted at sensitive areas and there is special vigil at certain spots. Senior IPS officers are also slated to meet religious heads on Friday.

Surat: A doctor in Sarthana lost Rs 10 lakh cash , which he had arranged to pay for his daughter’s fees in a Canada university, when two burglars targeted his clinic on January 14.

Dr Kirti Patel, 42, who runs a clinic in Swaminarayan Nagar Society, had put in Rs five lakh from his own savings and borrowed an equal amount to pay for the fees. On January 12 evening, he kept Rs five lakh of his savings in the drawer in the clinic, thinking that it would be safe. The next day, he borrowed Rs five lakh from his father-in-law and kept the cash in the same drawer.

He was planning to take take the whole amount and sent it for fee payment on January 14. However, when he reached there from his house in Utran and opened the drawer, Dr Patel was shocked to find the entire cash missing.

CCTV footages showed two persons coming near the clinic on a motorcycle. “We tracked their movement through CCTV, but the bike’s number was not seen due to poor resolution and absence of proper night vision camera. We are searching for more clues,” said Sarthana police station officials.

The thieves entered after breaking the lock of the shutter. The doctor told police that no one else except him knew about the cash kept in the drawer. “It seems to a handiwork of some professional thieves. They have not left any any marks in the clinic.”

68,['16/01/2020'],Bihar: Attempt to grab Magadh University land foiled,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Magadh University

GAYA: Attempt to grab nearly three acres of land belonging to the Magadh University was foiled on Wednesday as VC Prof Rajendra Prasad, registrar Sidnath Prasad Deen along with other university officials and local police reached the site where land grabbers were engaged in the construction of a boundary wall.

Confirming the incident, the registrar said that it was a serious matter and the state government as well the Chancellor’s office is being informed about the incident. “An FIR has also been lodged against the land grabber,” said the registrar. The land is located at Sripur Tand village of Mocharim panchayat to the south of MU campus.

As per available information about 100 acres off campus land donated to the university by philanthropists is currently under adverse possession. The university pays land rent to the government and the land produce including fruit and grains are usurped by land-grabbers. Successive VCs have requested the state government to evict the land usurpers but the complaints have largely gone unheeded. About 71 acres of the land is located at Zindapur village.

According to university insiders, the estate department staff of the university entrusted with the upkeep of the varsity assets has been hand in glove with the land-grabbers for obvious reasons.

Meanwhile, the university syndicate on Tuesday decided to convene the annual meeting of the senate. Senate is the apex body of the university and it functions through the syndicate. The senate meet has been scheduled for 16 February. The annual budget of the university for the financial year 2020-21 will be presented for approval. Once approved by the senate, the budget proposals will be forwarded to the state government.

The most important budgetary provision pertains to the salary of nearly 1700 teaching and non-teaching staff working in the university headquarters, 19 constituent and one government-funded minority college. Besides the emoluments of teaching and non-teaching staff, provision is also made for nearly 4500 pensioners including family pensioners.

The pension liabilities of the staff of 17 constituent colleges of Veer Kuer Singh University (VKSU), Ara, who retired before October 1992 and 25 constituent and three government-funded minority colleges of Pataliputra University reaching the superannuation age before March’2018 rests with the MU.

Both Veer Kunwar Singh University and Pataliputra University have been carved out of undivided MU. VKS University was established in October 1992 and Pataliputra University was established in March 2018.

The MU headquarters, as of now is over staffed as division of non-teaching employees between the parent MU and its off shoot, the PPU has yet not been finalised on account of differences between the senior functionaries of the two universities.

Earlier, the then MU VC Prof Qamar Hasan complained that the Pataliputra University wants to cherry pick from the list of MU employees, while he favoured staff division under some structured formula as was done in the case of VKS University.

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: India’s antitrust agency has directed a probe into alleged competition law violations by Asian Paints following a complaint by new entrant JSW Paints .

In its order, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said evidence provided by JSW Paints is prima facie sufficient to indicate that Asian Paints denied access to distribution channels to the former by threatening and coercing dealers through various means and the actions appear to be in contravention of fair trade rules.

The competition watchdog has instructed its investigative wing to submit the report in 60 days. JSW, which launched its decorative paints in May 2019, complained to the agency that Asian Paints pressurised dealers to not stock and display the former’s products in their outlets, thus preventing it from establishing a presence in the country. “Asian Paints is not only denying market access to a competing entity but also restricting the freedom of contract to dealers.”

The three-member CCI bench noted that the alleged restrictions on dealers not to deal with JSW Paints can create barriers for suppliers of paints, who compete against each other, besides not allowing the benefit of better prices to consumers.

Kolkata: The movement of Anglo-Indians against the decision of the Centre to de-reserve their seats in Parliament and the state legislative assemblies, which that started in the city last week, received an impetus on Wednesday when over one lakh Anglo-Indians from Kerala wrote to All India Anglo Indian Association president Barry O’Brien, joining the national movement.

The Anglo-Indians from Kerala joined the movement under the banner Union of Anglo Indian Associations. They had been protesting the decision in Kerala, but after they got the news of all other similar associations uniting after the clarion call in Kolkata, they decided to join in.

“In Kerala, the movement has already attained quite a status and we have been able to make some headway,” said chief of the union Marshal D’Cunha.

The assembly of Kerala had passed the de-reservation bill unanimously, but immediately thereafter, a resolution was taken that the Anglo-Indian reservation in Parliament and the state assemblies be restored.

The association now has 12 representative bodies in the movement. It has written separately to the President, Prime Minister, and the home and law ministers, for an appointment so that a team of Anglo-Indians can meet and explain why the reservation is a must for the community. “We have decided to include a member from the union as well. The movement has definitely gathered more steam now that the Kerala Anglo-Indians have joined us,” O’Brien said.

The letter has stressed that the appointment be given between January 21 and 24 because the reservation comes to an end on January 25.

72,['16/01/2020'],"IMA, IPA differ over PM’s reported remark of ‘pharma cos bribing docs’","This story is from January 16, 2020

Prime Minister Narendra Modi (File photo)

MUMBAI: There is fresh debate around Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s meeting on January 1 with pharma industry honchos, where he is reported to have lambasted the medical fraternity over unethical marketing practices.

The Indian Medical Association ( IMA ), the apex lobby representing doctors, has sought a clarification on whether the PM had stated that “pharma companies bribed doctors with women”. However, drug industry body Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ( IPA ) said the issue of code of marketing practices was not discussed at the meeting.

In an unprecedented “confrontation of sorts”, the IMA issued a communication on January 14 titled ‘Deny or Prove or Apologise’. It said it was skeptical of the government being able to prove allegations of (unethical marketing practices) and, if based on “unverified information, it is only appropriate that PM apologises” to country’s doctors.

Health activists and industry observers feel this has put the issue on the radar, further creating a trust deficit between healthcare stakeholders and the government. “We have now written to the PM”, a senior IMA official told TOI on Wednesday evening.

The January 1 meeting was called to hammer out a strategy for future road map for growth of the healthcare industry, and the next level of innovation, according to an industry executive who attended. The focus of the discussion was research and development, building innovation ecosystem, improve access to high quality medicine and strengthen global competitiveness of the industry. India is rightly described as the pharmacy of the world with a 20% volume share of the global market.

The purpose was to take industry to the next level, and leverage opportunities going forward in pharma sector, besides discussing growth opportunities in medtech and hospital sector, the IPA said in a statement.

Commenting on the development, Anant Bhan, researcher at Bioethics, Global Health and Policy, said, “This has put the issue on the radar, and will further create a trust deficit between healthcare stakeholders and the government, and the public, unless it leads to concrete, urgent regulatory oversight reform of pharma marketing.” Further, the IMA communication said, “The purpose seems to divert the attention from unresolved issues regarding health and medical education.”

Flaying government on the healthcare front, the communication says allocation for health has hovered around 1% to 1.3% of GDP for past few years, with no new investment in infrastructure or human resources. It even criticised Modi ’s ambitious flagship insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat, saying it’s a non-starter, and operates more in government hospitals where treatment is already free. “15% of the money paid to hospitals including government hospitals is siphoned off by insurance companies.”

The meeting was attended by Dr Reddy’s chairman Satish Reddy, Piramal Group promoter Ajay Piramal, Cadila Healthcare chairman Pankaj Patel, Sun Pharma promoter and MD Dilip Shanghvi, Wockhardt chairman Habil Khorakiwala, Cadila Pharma CMD Rajiv Modi, Torrent’s Sudhir Mehta, medtech industry representative Pavan Choudhary, and Apollo Hospitals executive vice-chairperson Shobana Kamineni.

MUMBAI: Credit card balances and personal loans have recorded the highest growth rates as lenders expand the market, providing finance to those who had not borrowed before. Credit cards and personal loans recorded growth rates of 40.7% and 28%, respectively, year-on-year (YoY) in July-September (Q2FY20).Unsecured loans are growing even as secured retail advances such as auto loans , loans against property (LAP) and home loans saw moderate rates of balance growth at 10.3%, 11.6% and 10.0%, respectively, according to TransUnion CIBIL’s Q2FY20 Industry Insights Report.Credit card balances and number of accounts increased YoY by 40.7% and 29.8% respectively taking total balances to Rs 1,09,000 crore and number of active cards in circulation to 44.5 million (see graphic). Balances of private card issuers increased by 50.7% YoY, while for other card issuers increased by 26.9% YoY.In the case of personal loans, outstanding grew 28% to Rs 4.3 lakh crore, which is now almost on a par with auto loans which have a base of Rs 4.38 lakh crore (10% growth). Personal loans are still less than a fourth of home loans, which stood at Rs 19 lakh crore (growth of 10% again).According to bankers, the growth in unsecured loans is driven by an expansion of the market, given that personal loans (excluding mortgages) as a percentage of gross domestic product is much lower than other emerging markets. Lenders like HDFC Bank have been expanding this market using technology in the form of analytics to automate lending. Besides banks, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) have a large chunk of unsecured finance loans.“Our findings suggest the shift toward consumption lending categories is becoming more sustained and is supported by a strong demand for these products. Consumer inquiry volumes for personal loans and credit cards increased significantly over the period, whereas we saw inquiries were broadly unchanged or slightly down for loans against property and home loans.” said TransUnion CIBIL vice-president (research and consulting) Abhay Kelkar.“This change in demand might, in part, be driven by consumer sentiment and wider macroeconomic pressures. Flattening demand for large-ticket asset purchases is causing slower asset finance loan originations, while consumers may be increasingly turning to consumption credit products to help finance day-to-day living expenses. This shift in consumer credit demand warrants ongoing monitoring to understand the impact on lender portfolios.”Also, growth in consumer lending is no longer concentrated in metro locations. Lenders have increased credit penetration to less densely populated geographies as part of their expansion strategies. Consumers in semi-urban and rural areas have also shown increased willingness to seek loans from formal lending institutions.The increase in delinquency rates was not uniform and was most pronounced for loan against properties, which was up 52 basis points (100 bps = 1 percentage point), home loans (up 13 bps) and credit cards (up 10 bps). Overall delinquencies actually improved for auto loans (down 22 bps) and personal loans (down 5 bps).",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73293997,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-54564,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/unsecured-consumer-loans-grow-most-credit-card-dues-at-rs-1l-cr/articleshow/73282292.cms

75,['16/01/2020'],Dehradun: IIT team finds new anti-bacteria drug,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Researchers from IIT-R

DEHRADUN: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (IIT-R) have claimed to have discovered a novel chemical compound that can act against multi-drug resistant bacteria. The researchers said that they had “screened a library of 11,000 compounds against ‘gram negative bacteria’ and identified a small molecule ‘IITR06144’ that can kill highly multi-drug resistant strains of Escherichia coli (that causes diarrhea), Acinetobacter baumannii (causing infections that occur due to hospital stay), Klebsiella pneumonia (bacteria that typically colonizes human mucosal surfaces of the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract) as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (bacteria causing tuberculosis).”

The study conducted by a team of 13 researchers from the institute started in 2010 and its report was published in the ‘Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy’ in October last year. Ranjana Pathania, professor at the department of biotechnology, IIT-R, one of the researchers involved in the study, told TOI, “Antibiotics are considered as the cornerstone of both basic and modern medicine and it is difficult to envisage a world without them. However, injudicious over-the-counter sales and excessive use and abuse of antibiotics in poultry, livestock and agriculture has given rise to the global problem of antibiotic resistance. With the ever-increasing rise in drug resistant superbugs and lack of effective antibiotics against them, it has become imperative to search for novel antibacterial molecules.”

She added that “the molecule that we have discovered has a broad-spectrum activity and it can kill all kinds of bacteria including gram negative pathogens which are very difficult to kill because they have a complex boundary outside the cell and molecules cannot get inside them.”

“For the past 30 years, there hasn’t been a new class of antibiotics that has been discovered against gram negative pathogens. We tested our molecule on strains obtained from AIIMS Delhi, Bhopal and a government hospital in Chandigarh, and also on animals, and its performance was found to be better than other similar antibiotics already in the market,” Pathania said. She added that “unlike conventional antibiotics, IITR06144 kills bacteria by targeting multiple pathways in the bacterial cell such as DNA repair and cell division machinery.” “Since multi-targeting antibiotics are less prone to resistance generation, therefore IITR06144 holds immense therapeutic potential. Also, while most of the antibiotics currently prescribed in clinics seem to kill the healthy gut bacteria, IITR06144 did not inhibit them, this being one of its most desirable properties,” the professor said.

76,['16/01/2020'],Puppalaguda land row reaches apex court again,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Supreme Court

HYDERABAD: Hinting at another round of fresh litigation over 200-acre prime land at Puppalaguda that was accrued to the state just three months ago, the Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its orders on hearing a plea filed by a few persons claiming a portion of the land as protected tenants .

They said that they were tilling the land since the British era as tenants and have hence become protected tenants under law.

A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta opined that the petitioners should first approach the high court rather than the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court had in October 2019 dismissed the plea of an alleged kin of an evacuee claiming 200 acres of land towards an unfulfilled claim. It also set aside two orders issued by Andhra Pradesh in 2003 and 2006, that were aimed at unduly enriching two private individuals who fraudulently laid claim over the land five decades after the evacuee claims were settled.

The high court too had quashed the allotment orders in 2016.

One of the claimants, Ramesh Malani, approached the Supreme Court challenging the order of the high court. During the country’s partition, Parasram Ramchand Malani left his property in Pakistan’s Sindh and settled in Hyderabad, India.

As per the provisions of the Displaced Persons (Compensation & Rehabilitation) Act and Administration of Evacuee Property Act, the central government and the state government allotted him 323 acres of land at Hyderabad’s Bata Singaram and Boinpally areas in 1956. Ramchand never claimed that he was entitled to any extra piece of land till his death in 1988, but during 2003, an application was made in the name of his alleged son Ramesh Parasram Malani seeking 200 acres more on the ground that they were entitled to get more. Ignoring the bar under the Limitation Act, the state of AP gave two orders in favour of the claimant in 2003 and 2006. However, the Hyderabad high court in 2016 concluded that this was a huge fraud and said that a police probe was needed.

Hyderabad police had also started investigation into these claims and the orders issued in their favour by IAS officials in 2003 and in 2006.

Now, the claims of a group of persons, Kundan Bai and others, in the name of protected tenants, have come to the fore. The SC bench reserved its orders on whether to hear them or to remand them to high court.

Representative image

PUNE: Maharashtra State Women’s Commission chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar is planning to request the state government to ensure more stringent rules to prevent sale of acid and curb the rising incidents of acid attack.

Rahatkar stated that there were several shops still selling acid. “Easy availability of acid is the primary reason for our failure to prevent such attacks,” she said.

While the Supreme Court had banned over-the-counter sale of acid, it is being done rampantly and this needs to be curtailed. “I shall be writing to the government to introduce checks,” she told TOI.

In 2013, the Supreme Court in the case of Laxmi vs Union of India and Others, had directed state governments and the Union territories to make appropriate rules for the sale of acid. The SC also directed states to implement stringent norms for retail of acid, treating it as a poison under the Poisons Act, 1919. Banning the sale of acid to minors, the court said the corrosive substance could be sold to only those who have valid identity cards issued by the government and that too after specifying the purpose for the purchase in writing.

While National Crime Records Bureau data has shown an increase in the rise of acid attacks, the chairperson said the incidents would continue unless there was strict implementation of the SC ruling.

The commission had earlier arranged a confidence walk. It has helped acid attack survivors find jobs as well. “We helped a girl from north India get re-married as well as provided assistance in meeting the medical expenses. We have also helped the survivors get jobs,” said the chairperson.

In December 2013, the SC directed all states to formulate specific rules regarding the sale of acid and for payment of compensation and provision of free medical treatment for survivors of acid attacks and notify the same before April 2014. The bench asked respective states to ensure that every police station, immediately after registering an FIR about an acid attack should intimate the sub-divisional magistrate concerned, who would inquire how assailant procured the acid.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Food and Drugs Administration on Tuesday seized gutka and paan masala worth around Rs50 lakh.

SS Deshmukh, the joint commissioner of the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), Pune, said the drive was conducted after receiving a tip-off. “A four-member team of the FDA raided a godown at Jambhe village of Mulshi taluka, near Pimpri Chinchwad city, and seized gutka/paan masala worth Rs49.75 lakh,” he said.

The banned goods were stored in a rented godown, located right behind the house of the man who had stowed them.

Deshmukh said, “Two rooms of the godown have been sealed to prevent future sale of banned goods from there. A complaint has been lodged at the Hinjewadi police station against the man who sold these goods and the person who rented out the godown.”

He said the samples had been sent to the state government laboratory to confirm if the seized stock comprised banned gutkha and paan masala. If it is confirmed, the accused can be sentenced to life imprisonment and fined up to Rs10 lakh.

Aurangabad Municipal Corporation

AURANGABAD: Amid the uproar over the proposal of cutting trees for the Bal Thackeray and Gopinath Munde ’s memorials, which are kept on hold, the tree authority of the civic body has not held a single meeting since April last year.

The multi-member body, comprising nature councillors and nominated members is headed by the municipal chief. They are expected to meet at least after a gap of 45 days.

The body regulates the felling of trees for development work and charts out plans for planting an adequate number of saplings in order to increase the green cover. The tree authority every year is expected to prepare a budget estimate on or before October end and forward it to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation for the final approval. The tree authority was scheduled to have its meeting after a long gap, early this week in presence of the municipal commissioner , but it was put off due to some reasons.

As many as 31 proposals seeking cutting of over 400 trees in different parts of the city were scheduled to be tabled during the meeting. The proposals included the fate of 110 trees to be axed for raising Munde’s memorial near government milk dairy on Jalna Road and 225 teak wood trees in Nakshatrawadi area.

Environmentalist Pankaj Shakkarwar said it remains a mystery which authority allotted the permission for tree-cutting within the jurisdiction of the AMC in the past nine months.

The city has not witnessed a single tree census within the municipal limits in the history of the AMC and the alleged poor presence of the tree authority is blamed for the lapse.

AMC acting garden superintendent, Vijay Patil, who is the ex-officio member of the tree authority, did not respond to phone calls and text message sent to him seeking his comment on the issue.

Environmentalist Kishor Pathak , who is one of the nominated members of the tree authority, said, “The civic authorities were reluctant to hold the meeting despite repeated follow-ups.”

Municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pande could not be reached for his comments.

80,['16/01/2020'],Savitribai Phule Pune University mulls over on-demand exam system for the benefit of students,"This story is from January 16, 2020

SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar

PUNE: The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) is contemplating an on-demand examination system to usher in flexibility and allow students to appear for exams as per their convenience.

The vice-chancellor of SPPU Nitin Karmalkar said while the choice-based credit system and an open learning centre were introduced to bring flexibility in the learning process, he had been thinking of taking it a step further by making the examination system “need-based”. This would also enable students, who participate in sports or other activities and are unable to appear for the scheduled examinations, to appear for them when they have the time.

“The choice-based credit system was introduced for flexibility in choosing subjects. The idea was that a science student could take up a humanities course or vice versa if s/he wanted. Unfortunately, that level of flexibility was not achieved. There were problems with rigid timetables and a general mindset against unconventional systems,” he said.

Karmalkar also spoke about how the next step would be to make examinations flexible. “If a sports student wanted to appear for the examinations at a later stage for any reason, it would be easy if there was a need-based examination system in place. We have been thinking about how it could be implemented,” he said.

Arvind Shaligram, controller of examinations at SPPU, said the need-based exam system was only an idea and no committee was working on its execution. It was something the university officials were serious about, he said.

“As per the present system, we prepare a schedule and students appear for the examination. The problem here is that the students who have not prepared for the examination also have to appear for it, which defeats its purpose. Examinations are to check how much a student has understood. A slow learner may require more time and hence s/he should be able to demand examination when s/he is ready. Similarly, a fast learner can appear for the exam early so that s/he can use the time to do something else or opt for more courses. At present, as the examination dates are fixed, it is a disadvantage for both groups of students,” he said.

Shaligram said a small step in this regard was taken during the semester-ending examination of the MBA students in December 2019. “We tried using a computer-generated question paper for MBA students. A question bank was created by the panel of paper-setters and fed into the system. When the paper pattern was decided, the software randomly picked the questions from this bank and generated a paper. This was then approved by the panel and used for the examinations. This was just one step towards on-demand examination system. More needs to be done and the SPPU would look into it,” he said.

81,['16/01/2020'],"CAA row: I’m not a rubber stamp, says governor","This story is from January 16, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Governor Arif Mohammad Khan , who has been at loggerheads with the state government ever since the state assembly passed the resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ), has made it clear that he is not a “rubber stamp”.

As a head of the state he has constitutional powers and duties to perform. “The state government had approached the Supreme Court against CAA. But I came to know about this only through the media. As a head of the state, the government should have informed about moving the SC,” the governor said.

“It is a breach of protocol and breach of courtesy. I will have to look whether the government can go to the court without the permission of the governor,” he added.

Khan has also denied the nod for an ordinance to delimit the local bodies ahead of the elections. The governor, who met local body minister A C Moideen on Wednesday, said that the government should have brought out a law for the delimitation instead of coming out with an ordinance.

He was upset over the state government convening a special one-day session of the assembly to pass a resolution against the Centre for passing the CAA.

The governor had openly criticised this resolution and had said that the resolution has no value.

Khan is learnt to have told the local body minister that if the state government has time to convene a special session of the assembly to pass a resolution, then the same should be adopted in passing the legislation too.

“I have not said I will not sign the ordinance. I have raised some queries to the state government on this and they are to come back with the explanation. I need time to go through the ordinance and I will act only as per the Constitution,” the governor said.

Even though he refused to comment on the queries he has raised against the ordinance, the governor said, “Anyway the assembly session is going to be convened this month itself. Then the government can bring out a legislation in that session.”

However, minister Moideen said the government was not ready to go into a direct confrontation with the governor. “The government has no issues with the governor. There is nothing illegal in the ordinance. This is not the first time that the government is going with an ordinance,” he said.

The government had gone for a legal opinion if the government returns the ordinance. It is learned that the government has decided not to send the file back to the governor again. The government is likely to come out with a legislation in the assembly session which is beginning this month end for the budget session.

DEHRADUN: As mark of protest against the state government, anganwadi workers in Dehradun performed a ‘ buddhi shuddhi yajna ’ to purify the minds of state government officials who, they alleged, are not acting on their demand of pay hike. Thousands of anganwadi workers from across the state have been protesting in the state capital for almost 40 days now.

Over 100 anganwadi workers took part in the yajna, in which women prayed that the government considers their plight and agrees to their 10 demands .

The state has 20,070 anganwadi centres in 13 districts, in which around 33,850 anganwadi workers, their assistants and helpers, work. Hundreds of anganwadi workers from various districts are sitting in protest at Dharna Sthal for 40 days, leaving their family and children behind.

“Our main demands are accordance of status of government employees, and salaries raised to Rs 21,000 per month. Our helpers, who do no less work than us, should get Rs 11,000 per month. We work 24 hours and in all areas, from health, education to administration. We deserve salaries that ensure minimum living standards at least,” said Rekha Negi, president, Uttarakhand anganwadi workers association.

Kochi: State government should explore the possibility of leveraging crowd sourcing and corporate social responsibility (CRS) for extending free treatment to children with rare diseases.

The suggestion was put forward by a division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly while considering an appeal filed by the government challenging a single bench’s order to provide free treatment to a child suffering from a rare disease. It is estimated that around 200 children are suffering from rare diseases in the state and their treatment requires Rs 1 crore per child annually.

Responding to an affidavit filed by the government stating that its own funds are not enough to extend free treatment, the division bench asked the government to inform whether it can come up with a solution by utilizing the funds allotted by the central government, state government’s own ‘WE CARE’ scheme, funds through CRS schemes of corporate establishments, and crowd-sourcing. Government should inform its views by Monday, the court directed.

Opposing the single bench’s directive to provide free treatment, state government had informed the court that such an option is too expensive and that a policy by the central government as well as central funding is required to extend free treatment.

In order to provide free treatment to children with rare diseases, more than 48% of the budgetary allocation for treatment of the poor has to be set apart, government had pointed out.

Even after providing such costly treatment, the survival rates of children with rare diseases is very low, government had submitted. While the average treatment cost of a single child with a weight of 20kg would be Rs 1 crore annually, around 20 renal transplantations or five liver transplantations or eight bone marrow transplantations can be carried out using such a fund.

These are life-saving medical interventions, government had informed. Thus, it would be highly unethical to divert the limited funds to provide free treatment to children with rare diseases while many kids are waiting for definite medical interventions with proven prognosis, the court was told.

He said such complaints are increasing in the state and the Synod’s demand that strict action be taken should be welcomed. “However, finance minister Thomas Isaac is learnt to have rubbished the claims made by the Church. This shows the CPM-Congress jihadi nexus,” he said.

The BJP leader said it is a serious allegation and the state government is turning a blind eye towards the issue.

Hundreds of complaints have been filed in various police stations across the state on the Love Jihad. But no arrests have been made so far in such cases, he alleged.

Meanwhile state police chief Loknath Behera said that they do not have any information on the matter. “If there is anything specific, the police will take necessary action,” he said. tnn

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has redirected a social media influencer to take down an allegedly disparaging video of a fast-moving consumer product while impressing upon them that influencing through social media is a responsibility that should be handled carefully.

The bench was hearing a plea by an oil-manufacturer, who claimed that the influencer had denigrated their product on a video. It also directed the vlogger (a person who creates and uploads video blogs) to not put up such posts in the future.

“Today, influencing through social media is one of the most impactful and effective ways of marketing and advertising…but it is a responsibility that must be assumed carefully,’’ said Justice S J Kathawalla.

The HC, after hearing hearing the company’s counsel Virag Tulzapurkar, found merit in the case.

“The defendant (vlogger) cannot, under the garb of educating / bring the true facts to public, provide misleading information to disparage the plaintiff’s (company’s) product,’’ said the judge in an interim ruling in the suit on January 15.

It found no merit in the vlogger’s counsel Abhinav Chandrachud’s plea who relied on a US Supreme Court decision that the company, if aggrieved, could always produce and upload a counter video of its own.

“Any campaign to educate the public by placing before them the true and correct facts may be welcomed. However, under the garb of educating…, no one should put misleading information which disparages or belittles someone else’s product or influence the consumer not to buy it.’

“A social media influencer who has or claims to have a sound knowledge in what they claim is their niche, and uses it to influence people into believing and subscribing to the same set of ideas or thoughts, has the power to influence people, to change attitudes and mindset. This mindset can be changed for the better, and scarily, for the worse,’’ said the judge adding “But first of all, there needs to be a deep awareness about the basic fact that this indeed is a responsibility.”

Kochi: The concluding session of the first meeting of the 28th Synod of the Syro-Malabar Church here on Wednesday again urged the central government to resolve the apprehensions the Citizenship (Amendment) Act has caused in the country.

The Synod observed that Christians were facing discrimination in the schemes for minorities and condemned acts of violence against Christians in the country as well as around the globe.

In the meeting, major policy decisions, including the appointment of Mar Jose Pulikal as the bishop of Kanjirappally and Fr Peter Kochupurackal as the auxiliary bishop of Palghat, were taken.

Cardinal Mar George Alencherry, the head of the Syro-Malabar Church, signed the declaration of the new appointments after receiving authorization from Pope Francis.

With the debate getting intensified over the two different styles of liturgies existing in the Syro-Malabar Church, the Synod on Wednesday made it clear that they prefer to use the same text through-out the Church. As a result, a revised text of liturgy has been submitted for the approval of Rome.

Other important decisions made, include a demand to raise pension of farmers to Rs 10,000 per month and other schemes for helping farmers who the Synod observed were reeling under a crisis.

Fifty-eight bishops, invited guests, priests, the religious and the laity were present at the meeting when the announcements were made.

An excavator is used to spray water on the debris of Holy Faith H2O, at Maradu on Wednesday

KOCHI: With the dust pollution near the four demolition sites at Maradu increasing as the steel removal progresses, residents complain that the measures taken by the authorities were not helpful. The agency removing the steel from the concrete debris started pumping water on the rubble pile at the directive of Pollution Control Board, but dust is still spreading to nearby places. Residents said that the authorities are not even distributing multi-layer masks to protect themselves from the unseen dust and they have to buy the masks on their own, which for many are unaffordable.

“Doctors said that the normal single-layer mask will not be of use as the size of the dust particle is very small and can easily enter the body through the pores of these masks. They suggest using the N95 mask, which is around Rs 90 per piece. Even if we buy it once or twice we have to buy new ones as these masks are getting dirty very easily due to dusty winds. We cannot afford buying it for all the family members until the debris is cleared off, which could take at least 60 days. The municipality or health department should distribute the masks for free,” said Antony Joseph, a resident near Alfa Serene.

Meanwhile, municipality officials said that they have started distributing three-layer masks to neighbouring residents of demolition sites and free medicals camps are being organized by the Primary Health Centre (PHC), Valanthakkad. They also said masks will be distributed to more people in the coming days.

“The municipality and health department are coordinating pollution control measures. Two medical camps have been conducted at Alfa Serene and Holy Faith H2O. At Jains Coral Cove, a pulmonologist from a private hospital conducted an awareness class for the residents to clear their doubts about the pollution. We have conducted inspections at all four sites and ensured that water is sprayed on the debris frequently. The demand raised by the residents for wind curtains around the site has been intimated to the agencies concerned and they said it will be done,” said a PHC official.

Meanwhile, the steel-removal work at Golden Kayaloram is yet to be started. Kayaloram has the least amount of debris — nearly 6,900 tonnes. But the amount of brick debris is higher at Kayaloram compared to other three buildings. Sources with the debris removal contractor said that the brick debris will not be of much use, except landfilling, compared to concrete debris which could be turned into M-sand.

Resident have complained that the brick dust from the uncovered site is settling down on their houses and vehicles. “I will have to repaint my house as its colour has changed from white to brown due to the brick dust. We can see orange dust flying in the air whenever wind blows. The work is yet to be started at Kayaloram and hence water is not being sprayed on the debris here unlike other sites. Now we are breathing dust,” said Saju Karukayil, a resident near Golden Kayaloram.

Health officials have been asking people to keep their doors and windows closed. They have been advised to keep their surrounding areas wet to settle dust, frequently vacuum the houses and take bath and wash eyes at regular intervals.

“Risk of throat and chest infection and sinusitis is high. Around two people from the neighbourhood have complained of eczema, a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked and rough,” said Dr Rahul Antony Simon, pulmonologist, Lakeshore Hospital.

Residents queue to pay house tax at DMC office in Doon on Wednesday

DEHRADUN: On the last day to avail discount on the submission of house tax for residents of old wards, the Dehradun Municipal Corporation ( DMC ) saw a big rush and many residents claim that they had to wait for several hours in queue to file their house tax.

Radhey Shyam, a resident of the Danda Lakhond ward, said, “I came here (DMC office) to submit house tax at 11 am but it took me around six hours to get my work done. As it was the last day to avail discount on house tax, a large number of people came to file their taxes and because of this, I have lost an entire working day.”

Echoing similar sentiments, another resident said that the civic body should have made better arrangements for the people. Joginder Pal, a resident of Karanpur ward, said, “I have been here since 12.30 pm and it seems that I will get free only after 5 pm. The DMC appeals constantly to the residents to submit their house tax but they should also make better arrangements for us. If it is taking them so much money to collect it, imagine how long it will take them to tabulate it.”

Sandeep Sharma, a resident of Race Course ward, said, “It took almost three hours to submit house tax today. The entire system is haywire. Not only there was insufficient stuff to collect taxes but those present were also very confused. They were also not prepared to handle such a big crowd.”

The civic body had announced that the residents of old wards will be given a discount of 25% on house tax if they submit it by January 15, 2020. Originally, 60 wards came under the old ward category but eight of the 40 new wards were also included in the old ward category.

Now, the number of wards coming in the old ward category has gone up to 68 wards. The owners of the commercial properties of the 32 new wards, which previously came under the rural area, can avail 25% discount on property tax if they submit it by January 31, 2020.

Meanwhile, a DMC official said that residents could have availed off the online facility to pay house tax. “If they had paid taxes online, the rush could have been avoided. However, despite today’s rush, our staff managed it well,” said a civic official on the condition of anonymity.

Varanasi: Construction work in ambitious Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) project took off on the occasion of Makar Sankranti on Wednesday.

Priests performed Neev pujan at the site where land for the foundation of proposed city museum building has been dug-up.

Talking to TOI, divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “The company, which has been assigned the contract for KV Dham construction under the supervision of PWD, has been given the deadline of 18 months to complete the project.”

PSP, a Gujarat-based company, was awarded contract for quoting lower price (Rs 339 crore) against the only rival Shapoorji Pallonji which quoted Rs 422 crore during the bidding process in December 2019.

The company’s officials reached Varanasi a week ago.

“Before the commencement of construction, the state government had approved the revised budget of project from Rs 318.6 crore to Rs 347.5 crore by including GST cost and some other components,” Agrawal said, adding that the budget of Rs 318.6 crore, which was initially approved for construction work, had been sanctioned without including GST charges.

KV Dham project was approved by the Yogi Adityanath government in December 2017. After purchasing over 70% buildings of 296 structures identified for demolition, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid foundation of the project on March 9. The project is proposed to come up in an area of 5.30 lakh square feet.

After the submission of a detailed project report of the Ahmedabad-based firm HCP Designing Planning and Management Private Limited to Sri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board in July 2019, working agency Rajkiya Nirman Nigam had forwarded an estimate of Rs 461 crore to the state government.

“To examine the estimate submitted by RNN, the state government had formed a three-member committee of technical experts. The panel examined the DPR and RNN’s estimate after which the budget of construction and other work reduced to Rs 318 crore from Rs 461 crore. After approving the revised budget, the state government replaced RNN with PWD to execute the project,” said Kashi Vishwanath temple’s chief executive officer Vishal Singh.

“Over Rs 300 crore has already been spent on purchase of 296 buildings in the project area. With the demolition of all purchased buildings, the ground of entire project area has been cleared and isolated by installing an enclosure,” said Singh.

KOCHI: The dust emerging from the demolition sites at Maradu is not just affecting the people in the vicinity. More residents in the city are complaining of breathing ailments, asthma, cough and fever. People living in areas like Vyttila, Giri Nagar and Chilavannoor as well as those living along the banks of the backwaters at Edakochi have complained of dust pollution.

P D Martin, councillor representing Giri Nagar, said: “The concrete dust is a major concern. However, it is unsure whether the ailments are a result of dust arising from the building debris at Maradu or whether it is due to the prevailing climate conditions.”

According to the online live data available on the pollution control board’s (PCB) website, the particulate matter (PM) levels are high. This is the real-time information from ambient air monitoring station situated at Vyttila Hub. It indicates the amount of fine dust particles present in the air. The PM 2.5 standard is 60 microns per cubic meter, and that of PM 10 is 100 microns per cubic meter. According to PCB officials, data over the years indicate that PM 10 levels have been occasionally high, but JPM 2.5 averages have stayed within limits of 60 microns per cubic meter in this station.

Meanwhile, those living along the sides of backwaters at Edakochi North division of Kochi corporation complain about increased level of dust pollution. Indira Gandhi Road residents’ association president K A Benny said: “Several people have started complaining about breathing ailments and fever. At least four persons from the region have been admitted at various hospitals in the past couple of days.”

District medical officer Dr M K Kuttappan said this being a dry season and with a fall in temperature some people might experience breathing ailments and asthma. Moreover, there can be issues related to the presence of pollens in the air. However, he said local bodies are taking measures to contain the dust arising from the debris at the demolition site. “If people experience health issues because of the concrete waste, they can report it to the local bodies or health officials. Instructions have been issued in this regard. So far no major public health concerns have been reported.”

95,['16/01/2020'],Antenatal homes in Wayanad to help tribal women avoid home deliveries,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Kozhikode: In a unique healthcare initiative aimed to address the continuing home deliveries and resultant medical complications among tribal women , the health department opened the state’s first tribal antenatal home (Garbhakala Gotra Mandiram) built as a replica of a traditional tribal house in Wayand on Thursday where pregnant woman can come and stay with their family in their final months of pregnancy .

Wayanad district, which has the largest tribal population in the state, has been witnessing around six home deliveries among tribal communities every month. Health officials say that many tribal women still prefer home deliveries mostly due to cultural factors and traditional beliefs associated with pregnancy and childbirth and the reluctance for institutional delivery often came in the way of providing immediate medical care in the case of high-risk births or postnatal complications.

“Tribal communities used to follow their own customs with respect to deliveries like having a dedicated building (pura) for child birth in the colonies. Also, taking delivery used to be responsibility of an elder woman and in many communities husband has to be near the woman during the pregnant days. Moreover, many find it difficult to adapt to hospital settings. Due to such factors many tribal women have been showing reluctance to come to hospitals especially for their second and subsequent deliveries, which made us think of having a tribal antenatal home next to the hospital,” National Health Mission district programme manager Dr B Abhilash said.

He said that there have been instances of tribal pregnant women running away from their homes to homes of relatives and even into the forest when health officials went to meet them to get them admitted to hospitals.

“Once we had to seek the assistance of a woman police officer to get a tribal woman in Vellamunda get admitted to a hospital. She was against hospital admission and the fully pregnant woman ran away when she saw us,” Dr Abhilash said.

The first tribal antenatal home set up next to the Vazhavatta public health centre was inaugurated by state health minister K K Shailaja. Six other such homes are under construction in various tribal areas of Wayanad. The minister said that the infant mortality rate in Wayanad has come down from 12 to 7 during the last four years and she hoped that the initiative would help bring it down further.

Tribal pregnant women can stay in these homes from their eighth month of pregnancy along with their families. The building has two rooms and a kitchen where they can cook and have their own food. Health officials said that the families staying in the homes would be provided rice and other food material if needed.

The building has been built the tribal way using mud by Habitat Technology Group.

96,['16/01/2020'],CAA will make India Hindu Rashtra: Activist,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Protesters take oath at the rally organised by Muslim Central Committee in Mangaluru on Wednesday

MANGALURU: It was a show of strength against CAA and NRC: Over a lakh people participated in the rally against the Union government’s Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR), at the Shah Garden opposite Central Juma Masjid in Adyar, Kannur, on Wednesday.

The rally was organised by the Muslim Central Committee and supported by nearly 30 organisations, including the Congress party.

Addressing the gathering from the ‘Shahid Abdul Jaleel Kandak and Nauseen Kudroli stage’, former IAS officer, author and activist Harsh Mander said this was a fight to save the Constitution. “Indian Muslims are Indians by choice,” he said.

Mander said for the Union government the issues of Ram Mandir and Kashmir are over, and that they are trying to convert India into a Hindu nation.

“People are now aware of the government’s agenda. Humanity is my religion. In case the government wants to decide my religion on the basis of documents, I will register as Muslim,” he said.

He asked the people to stay united, and that this movement should be taken up on the lines of Mahatma Gandhi’s Civil Disobedience Movement. The movement will be taken forward, with the Constitution and tricolour in our hands, and loads of love in our hearts, said Mander.

Human rights activist Shivasundar requested the opposition parties, including the Congress, to see that NPR/NRC is withdrawn during the budget session. Several Congress leaders from the district, including MLA U T Khader, were present.

The CAA is pending before the Supreme Court. He criticised the Union government for spreading lies with regard to NRC,NPR and CAA.

He mocked home minister Amit Shah for not knowing Indian history, and called him confused because anti-CAA, NPR and NRC protests are turning violent only in states that are ruled by the BJP.

“When 200 people protested in Mangaluru on December 19, there was firing, and CCTV cameras and DVRs were taken away by the police, because the police are taking orders from Nagpur and Kalladka republic,” he said.

He also called the Prime Minister confused for spreading lies, and called upon RSS leader Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat to follow the ideals of B R Ambedkar as enshrined in the Constitution.

“The hidden agenda of implementing CAA is to convert the nation into a Hindu Rashtra, and the government has been misleading the people by saying that CAA and NRC have no connection. CAA is being implemented to save non-Muslims who have no documents. With implementation of the new rules, the government will follow the ‘3D principle’ that is doubtful citizen, declared foreigner, detention centre and deaths. At least 30 people have died in six detention centres in Assam,’’ he claimed.

Former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan, hitting out at the Union government, said the government thought it could scare the people, but there is a limit for everything.

“Now that people have taken to the streets, the government is scared. The fight to save the Constitution and secularism must be the responsibility of all citizens, including non-Muslims,’’ he added.

Advocate Sudhir Kumar Maroli questioned why the government is not speaking about the benefits of demonetisation. He said it is important to go to villages and spread awareness against NPR, NRC and CAA.

The protest and awareness rally was carried out under the theme ‘Save Constitution Save India’ and ‘We the people of India’.

Thiruvabharanam being received by the tanthri and melshanti at Sannidhanam

SANNIDHANAM: Thousands of devotees witnessed the ‘ Makaravilakku ’ amid reverberating Ayyappa chants on Wednesday.

The ‘Makaravilakku’, which flashed three times from 6.52pm at Ponnambalamedu, marked the culmination of the over two months of Mandala-Makaravilakku pilgrimage season.

Pilgrims thronged Sannidhanam from Tuesday itself for witnessing the ‘Makaravilakku’—or the holy flame—forcing the police to restrict the devotees from Wednesday morning.

Vehicles ferrying pilgrims to Pamba, the base camp, were stopped at Nilackal from 9am. Devotees at Pamba were prevented from trekking from 11 am to evening, to avoid rush at the hill shrine.

Officials of the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) received the processing carrying the Thiruvabharanam, the deity’s ornaments and attire, at Saramkuthy at 5pm. Only the 25-member team accompanying the Thiruvabharam from Pandalam palace were allowed to proceed further to Sannidhanam, where TDB president N Vasu received the procession at 6.30pm.

After adorning the idol with the ornaments, the sanctum santorum opened for ‘deeparadhana’ at 6.50pm. Pilgrims with folded palms waited for the ‘Makaravilakku’, and once it became visible, Ayyappa chants, rose from Sabarimala.

Minister for devaswom Kadakampally Surendran, TDB president Vasu, Pathanamthitta district collector P B Nooh, devaswom secretary K R Jyotilal, IGP S Sreejith, and other senior officials were present.

After the darshan, police allowed devotees to trek back in batches to avoid rush.

“We have arranged 750 buses for pilgrims to various destinations from Nilackal. The pilgrimage season went smoothly and was incident-free,” Nooh said.

Violence marred the previous pilgrim season after the Supreme Court allowed women of menstruating age—defined as those aged between 10 and 50—also to offer prayers at the shrine.

Earlier in the morning, minister Surendran presented musician Illayaraja the Harivarasanam Award at Sannidhanam. Illayaraja also had a darshan at the temple after receiving the award, comprising a cash prize of Rs 1 lakh, citation and a plaque.

98,['16/01/2020'],Uttarakhand: Bhotia dogs' sale down markedly in Uttarayani Mela,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Locals blame tight regulations for the dip in the sale of Bhotia dogs

BAGESHWAR: Shobhram, 50, a local trader, travelled over 130 kilometres with two dozen Bhotia dogs to reach Bageshwar so he could sell them at the annual Uttarayani Mela . But he could only sell a few of them and still has 15 Bhotia dogs left with him.

Shobhram is among the many such traders who make yearly trips to the upper reaches of the Himalayas to buy the Himalayan dog and sell them at the annual fair. However, the sale of Bhotia dogs has been dwindling over the years.

“I bought two dozen dogs this year. They were one to two months old. These dogs came for Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,000 each and on a good day, can sell for Rs 20,000 each,” said Shobhram, ruing the fact that the number of tourists coming to the Uttarayani Mela had been dipping for many years.

Another local trader told TOI that the mela, held every year on Makar Sankranti, has for centuries been a cheap market for purchase of Bhotia dogs. “Tourists from all over North India used to come to this mela but their footfall has decreased in the past few years and so has the sale of Bhotia dogs,” the trader added.

The locals also blamed tight regulations for the dip in the sale of the dogs. “A few days ago, officials told some of us that we cannot sell dogs in the mela as we don’t have registration. They added that we may be booked for selling dogs here,” said BS Mehta, who had been selling dogs in the fair for 15 years now.

Notably, the market isn’t sanctioned by the administration. “I came here to buy a Bhotia dog but locals told me that this market is illegal,” said Aslam, who came to the mela from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh.

When queried on the issue, a district official told TOI, “The market isn’t registered and we have received several complaints of animal cruelty. We are ensuring that no animal is treated badly.”

Meanwhile, Bageshwar district magistrate Ranjana Rajguru said, “We understand the cultural and the economic value of the market. We are trying to regularise the market and the sellers so that business is conducted fairly.”

The exhibition titled ‘Fantasy 2020’ has attracted more than 100 visitors since its inauguration on Sunday.

“It is not easy for a woman, especially a homemaker, to pursue her dreams and aspirations. When I was as a teenager, I used to draw just a hobby.

Today, I am here hosting eighth painting exhibition of my career,” Geethkarthika said.

“After dispensing my duties as a mother and wife, I guess time has come for me to pursue a career as an artist. I am still a student. I try to learn new things every day and try to bring a difference in each of my exhibitions,” Geethkarthika added.

Geethkarthika said she has made it to this phase of life by constantly motivating herself and taking strenuous efforts to learn and perfect her craft.

After the exhibition of contemporary figurative paintings and murals at Vyloppilly Samskrithi Bhavan, Geethkarthika will be focusing on Indo-Arabic paintings. “The appreciation and criticism that I receive from these exhibitions help me grow as an artist,” she said.

Students painted the walls to speak out against the police action on Jamia campus on December 15

NEW DELHI: Students of Delhi University , Jawaharlal Nehru University and Ambedkar University Delhi (AUD) on Wednesday made their way to Jamia Millia Islamia to show solidarity and be a part of the “Jamia Chalo” protest marking one month of the violence that erupted on the campus.

As the protesters raised slogans against CAA-NRC, the Jamia administration called a meeting of the executive council and decided that they would file an application in court under Section 156(3) of CrPC seeking direction to police to register an FIR in the December 15 violence.

Hundreds of students assembled in front of gate number 7 (Bab-E-Maulana Abul Kalam Azad) to raise their voice against CAA and NRC. Traffic on the road leading to Jamia had to be diverted to the opposite carriageway. Along the road, students had set up an open library with a wide variety of donated books and a photo exhibition titled “Hum Dekhenge”. The walls of MAK Pataudi Sports Complex were painted with graffiti and protest art.

“We painted the walls to raise our voice against police brutality and the violence that erupted on our campus. Not just students of Jamia’s fine arts department, but even volunteers joined in to paint the walls,” said Jamia fine arts student Simi Anjum.

Harshita Singh, a BA (programme) student from Lady Shri Ram College said, “Me and others from my college have come here to express solidarity with the Jamia students. If the people in power were logical and could see the struggle of the people, they would not have acted in this manner.” A film studies student at AUD, Anya Ramananujam said the attack on students touched a raw nerve.

Several local residents also took part in the protest march. Holding a banner, Haji Mohammad Zahid, a photographer from Okhla Vihar, said, “I have been a part of the protest for the past one month. We want this black law to go away as it will be good for India. The protests will continue.”

JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh thanked the Jamia students “for showing love and solidarity” during her struggle. “The women of Jamia are our inspiration. If women of Shaheen Bagh are out on the streets and are not scared, then how can I be scared of the goondas who came to the campus and attacked us? Our spirit is strengthened by our unity,” she added.

Attacking Delhi Police for destroying the Jamia campus and the library, Ghosh said, “It is against law to destroy the property of a university. What is happening in Kashmir is wrong. We must not forget about Kashmiris because that is where the government started their attempt to take away our constitutional rights.”

Meanwhile, as exams were cancelled on January 13, the Jamia administration said that the new datesheet will be declared by the controller of examinations in consultation with all the deans.

Allahabad: A 19-year-old youth was allegedly murdered while he was out with his friends near Devghgat Jhalwa area, under Dhoomanganj police station, late Tuesday night.

Police said the deceased was identified as Vishal, a resident of Kalindipuram.

Morning walkers spotted Vishal’s body on Wednesday and alerted the police. The body was found with a slit throat and hidden behind bushes.

SSP (Allahabad) Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said, “One of Vishal’s close friends Suraj called him around 5pm on Tuesday evening. Suraj asked Vishal to accompany him to Pattupur. While stepping out of the house, Vishal told his family about where he was heading and that he would be back in 10 minutes.”

The SSP said that the deceased youth used to help his father in making furniture and odd plumbing jobs.

After an hour, Suraj reached Vishal’s home and handed over the keys of the latter’s motorcycle to his father Nand Lal. Suraj told Nand Lal that Vishal would return shortly.

When Vishal didn’t turn by 8pm, his family called him and he assured them that he would return at the earliest. However, that was the last time Vishal’s family heard of him as he was was found dead the next morning.

The SSP said that the police have picked up two men for interrogation. A case under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code has been lodged and the body has been sent for postmortem examination. Police said that Vishal and Suraj met with a couple of other friends on Tuesday night and suspect that they might have murdered him.

Meanwhile, a 24-year-old woman was found hanging at her home in Malviya village, under the limits of Industrial area police station, late Tuesday night.

The deceased was identified as Kajal. Her family alleged that her husband and in-laws had strangled the woman to death and then hanged her body to make it appear like a suicide. Police said Kajal and one Sanjeev Nishad had been married for two years. Apart from sending the body for postmortem examination, police have lodged a case under Dowry Prohibition Act.

Kanpur: The five accused, who were arrested by the police during the recent riots in the city to lodge a protest against CAA, moved their bail applications in the sessions court here.

According to the police record, four accused were arrested from Babupurwa and one from Yateemkhana during the riots. They were identified as Pervez Alam, Shahzad Alam, Adil, Mustqim (Babupurwa) and Mohd Tahil alias Mohsin. As their bail applications were earlier rejected by the lower court, they preferred the same in the sessions court.

To recall, the additional district and sessions judge (XII), Kanpur Nagar, Vinay Singh, who had heard the bail applications of the two accused--Pervez Alam and Shahzad Alam--on Monday last, rejected them on the ground that there was no ground to grant them bail.

During the hearing of the bail applications, the police had produced the evidence and the investigation report. On the other hand, the kin of the arrested persons pleaded that the accused were innocent and had been fabricated by the police after using third-degree against them.

The bail applications of three other accused--Adil, Mustquim and Mohd Tahil alias Mohsin--are still pending for hearing and might be heard this week.

According to police sources, more than 20 identified accused are absconding, and efforts are being made to seek a non-bailable warrant from the court against them for further legal proceedings.

The Colonelganj police station too had registered a case under heinous violence offences but no one has been arrested so far. According to police, the investigation was going on and evidence against the accused were being collected.

Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala state coastal area development corporation(KSCADC) is set to undertake two major shore protection works at Poonthura and Muthalapozhy . The projects will be implemented at a cost of Rs 31 crores. The work at Poonthura involves shore protection and providing beach landing facility at a cost of Rs 16.96 crores. The offshore breakwater will be constructed using geo-synthetic tubes. Tenders have been called for both the projects.

The work at Muthalapuzhy which is being funded by KIIFB includes shore protection at Muthalapozhy fishing harbour near Thazhampally side and Kadinamkulam backwater. The project which will be implemented at a cost of Rs 14.53 crores involves shore protection with rubble mount groynes and river side protection with geo tubes.

The project is proposed to construct rubble mount numbering ten groins of length varying from 95 to 40m. Groins are proposed with different category of granite quarry stones. The shore works near kayal side have been proposed with geo tubes.

As per the document prepared by KSCADC, this area was a vulnerable stretch of beach and was protected with a massive sea wall. The construction of breakwater has restricted the long shore sediment transport resulting in massive accretion on the southern bank of the estuary and severe erosion on the northern coast up to a distance of 3.00kms from the break waters.

The existing seawall is found to be inadequate to withstand the fury of monsoon waves. The seawall is damaged at many places. Already a groin is constructed by the Harbour Engineering Department has constructed a groyne at a distance of 300m North of North break water. This was effective in preventing the beach erosion for a distance of 300 meters. The studies proposed here is to find suitable solution for the beach erosion issue in the region, the tender document noted. Beach nourishment at Poonthura will be done after completing the placement of Geosynthetic tubes. As per the project document, Poonthura sandbank where the Killiyar discharges in to the sea is situated at the south side of the coast line to be protected.

Unprotected beach measuring 750 m lies north of the existing sandbank. This beach is being used by the fishermen community for fish landing operations. High waves resulted during Ockhi and subsequent depressions washed away the beach and the fishermen lost their beach for landing the vessels.

The beach is protected with sea wall for a length of about 400 meters. Beyond this there are 8 groynes of length less than 50 meters. The head portion of these groynes have almost washed away. The existing shore protection systems were found ineffective and in many places the sea wall is collapsed and severe wave overtopping is observed.

PUNE: In a blink-and-miss theft, a truck was stolen within five minutes in the early hours of Tuesday at Somatane village near Talegaon Dabhade , about 30km from the city.

The truck driver, Sohanlal Sharma, had gone out of the vehicle’s cabin for answering nature’s call leaving behind the ignition key. When he returned after five minutes, the vehicle was missing.

Sharma immediately alerted the truck owner, Bahalsingh Bal (50) of Kalamaboli in Raigad. Bal later lodged an FIR with the Talegaon Dabhade police.

Sub-inspector Dnyaneshwar Bajgire of the Talegaon Dabhade police said Sharma was returning to Kalamboli on Monday night after delivering some consignment at Karad. “As Sharma felt drowsy, he stopped the truck near a petrol pump at Somatane and slept inside the vehicle,” Bajgire said.

He said Sharma woke up around 3.20am on Tuesday for answering nature’s call. “He came out of the cabin without removing the ignition key. When he returned, the truck was not there,” Bajgire said.

Sharma searched the truck in the vicinity and then informed Bal. “We checked the CCTV footage from the toll plazas at Talegaon Dabhade and near Lonavla. The truck did not pass through them,” Bajgire said.

The PMPML is set to get the corporation’s Aundh octroi post land for developing a dedicated parking lot and setting up charging points for new buses to be added to its fleet soon

PUNE: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited is set to get the corporation’s Aundh octroi post land for developing a dedicated parking lot and setting up charging points for new buses to be added to its fleet soon.The proposal to hand over the land of the octroi post measuring 7,000sqm to Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) was approved by the civic body’s standing committee recently. It is now awaiting the nod of the general body of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).The PMPML has been facing shortage of space to park its buses during night hours. It does not have a depot in the Aundh area at present. The buses are often parked on the university road during night hours because of space constraints.The transport utility had approached the civic administration seeking land of the octroi post, lying vacant after the state government abolished octroi. The PMC has not utilized the plot so far for any other purpose.“The PMPML is in process of procuring more buses in phases. It will require more land because the existing depots are proving insufficient. A proposal was tabled before the standing committee to allot the land at the earliest for the next five years and sign a contract with the PMPML for the same,” said an official from the civic administration.The standing committee, while giving a go-ahead to the allotment of the land, said it was a step towards strengthening the public transport system and to improve the PMPML services.The PMC had initially told the PMPML to pay Rs40 lakh against the land and its utilization for five years. The transport utility had expressed its inability to make the payment as it was facing financial challenges. The PMC has now proposed to recover the rent amount through the grant, given to the PMPML to make up for the operational losses.A source from the PMPML said with increasing fleet, it has already started exploring the options of utilizing its existing land more effectively. The PMPML is utilizing the PMC’s land of octroi post in the Hadapsar (Shevalewadi) area. Handing over the PMC’s plots for bus operations would be vital for improving the public transport services, the source added.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73291673,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-135383,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-to-get-civic-bodys-aundh-octroi-post-land/articleshow/73281453.cms

The programme was finally held on campus

NEW DELHI: Delhi University’s Ramjas College witnessed a major drama on Wednesday when the students protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) came across a notice that no programme could be held at the institute’s amphitheatre without prior permission.

They accused the administration of trying to disrupt their public meeting and the reading of the preamble of the Constitution while the principal claimed it to be the rule of the college. As large numbers of both pro- and anti-CAA/NRC students gathered on the premises, police were called in to avoid any untoward incident. The programme was finally held after a march inside the campus. The protest was organised by the Young India coordination committee, a student platform that has been organising anti-CAA/NRC events across the country.

Abhigyan, a second-year political science student, said, “We had invited DU teachers Laxman Yadav and Hany Babu but they didn’t come because of the situation. The administration issued the notice on Tuesday though the amphitheatre is used for public meetings. Another group had organised a programme on Swami Vivekananda on Tuesday.”

Principal Manoj Khanna said, “If any department wants to hold a function, it has to take the administration’s permission. Is it possible that anybody can come and do anything at the amphitheatre? If something goes wrong, who will be responsible?” The college would have made proper arrangements if the permission was taken, he added.

The students admitted that they had not sought permission, though they had been campaigning in the college. After reading the preamble and singing the national anthem, “we did a sit-in in front of the amphitheatre as a mark of protest. When police asked us to disperse, we did so peacefully,” said a student.

The principal said, “If you want a debate on anything, there has to be both views. It should be an open debate, where each side gets a chance to convince their audience.”

NEW DELHI: Sealed locks, dust-covered shutters and dogs idling on near-empty streets — the lanes of the once bustling Suit Market at Amar Colony in south Delhi are almost deserted today. In a single day on March 8 in 2018, 350 shops there were closed down, making it the site of the biggest sealing exercise since December 2017 when the Supreme Court revived the committee to monitor illegal commercial establishments. But other places too have suffered similarly.The triple whammy — sealing, economic slowdown and infrastructure woes — has Delhi’s traders, considered traditional BJP supporters, in a fix as February 8 approaches and they have to opt for the party to vote to power in Delhi. With estimates of 15 lakh in its fold and another 20-25 lakh as employees, the trader community is a significant ‘influence group’ in Delhi politics, and the parties cannot afford to alienate it.With the Gross State Domestic Product of Delhi logging Rs 7.8 lakh crore in 2018-19, the city bustles with economic activities, both manufacturing and services. There are 18-20 assembly constituencies, among them Karol Bagh, Chandni Chowk, Sadar Bazar, Wazirpur, Rajouri Garden and Rohini, populated by a large number of trading families.

Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary, Confederation of All India Traders, asserted that merchants also wanted infrastructure development. “While the municipal corporations rake in crores of rupees in parking and conversion charges, no infrastructure has been developed. Traffic congestion and parking affects consumer patterns,” he said.Expressing similar frustrations about the cess collected by the municipal bodies not leading to development, Sanjay Bhargav, president, Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, added, “Lack of infrastructure in markets is the main issue highlighted by the Supreme Court.”Khandelwal said CAIT was also demanding further simplification of the Goods and Services Tax set-up because complicated forms and monthly filing requirement still rankle. “Small shop owners are forced to spend money on accountants for this,” he said, while pointing out that Delhi’s godown policy too continued to be faulty with storage not allowed in urban areas under Master Plan Delhi 2021.Yogesh Singhal, head of Bullion and Jewellers Association in Chandni Chowk, one of Delhi’s biggest gold markets, too summed up the traders’ woes by stressing on the need for tax reforms and a tax system based on transaction tax. Other problems that traders drew attention to included the absence of functional amenities like washrooms in markets, unfair practices of e-commerce giants, shifting of 14 wholesale markets to new complexes and the notification of 351 streets for mixed and commercial land use.BJP will bank on the support of three lakh petty shopkeepers and small scale industrialists in unauthorised colonies, where land ownership rights have recently been granted. But recent public events have shown that the party cannot take this support for granted. “I participated in the Vyapari Mahasammelan in Talkatora Stadium in April last year when PM Narendra Modi came.

115,['16/01/2020'],Maharashtra: An adult who has not lost childlike qualities,"On the eve of his visit to Nagpur, here are some nuggets about Chief Justice Sharad Bobde penned by his childhood friend Vijay Dandige

“What’s the real name of Pele?”The question was flung at me by a boyish face as we sat in my friend Vinod’s spacious house in Civil Lines. It was 1965, the first year of college. The question had come from Vinod’s younger brother, Sharad. As I struggled to come up with the answer, pat came the reply from him, “Edson Arantes do Nascimento.”That was my first meeting with Sharadbhau, as we call him now.Although Vinod was my friend, I developed over the years a singular bond with Sharadbhau, even though I was almost a decade older than him.I believe everyone should have a friend with whom one can spend hours discussing, sharing new books and authors, new tenets and philosophies and many other things. That’s the bond I have shared with Sharadbhau.It was only years later that I understood his penchant for asking questions. It was not meant as a prank or a trick. It sprang from his innate nature, his intense curiosity about everything.Today, decades later, he has not changed at all. He is the only adult I know who has not lost his childlike qualities : Insatiable curiosity to know and to understand everything, a sense of wonder, the joy of discovery of new things. He is the only one I know who is passionately driven by a desire to find out why things happen, how things work and how they can be improved. He is like a man who is perpetually in awe of the magnificence of life, as reflected in all beings and things around us, and whose ravenous curiosity impels him to fully drink in and savour that beauty in myriad forms.Sharadbhau’s interests and passions have been breathtakingly vast and universal, astounding in their sheer breadth, ranging from, among others, Oscar Wilde, Jiddu Krishnamurti’s philosophy, Sun Tzu’s The Art of War to the grand vision of the Upanishads, Jim Corbett’s hunting skills, the Beatles to Koran’s teachings, quirks of singer Bhimsen Joshi, dribbling skills of Irish footballer George Best to the dialogues between Lord Shiva and Parvati from Tantra, Harley Davidson bikes, the power of Gayatri mantra to Ernest Hemingway, parables of the Bible, Guru Gobind Singh to bisons and their strength, how Moses wrote the Torah, Ilie Nastase's tennis wizardry, to Sant Tukaram’s abhangas, the secret behind Marilyn Monroe’s stunning impact, the concept of dharma in the Geeta and Scriptures to Chanakya's brilliance, general Rommel’s conquest of Africa, the purifying qualities of gou-mutra to the uplifting vibrations of Rudra chanting, the medicinal qualities of snakes' venom, Colin Wilson's the Outsider to the Japanese ritual of seppuko, the parables of Ramkrishna, the tenets of ancient Indian Nyaya system....just to mention a few. This kaleidoscopic list could go on.Back in the 70s, captivated by the reptile and animal world, he once caused hilarious consternation in his household by keeping a non-poisonous snake in his room as a pet. On another occasion, at the house of a friend who collected snakes, to get a closer look he came within the striking range of a fully-grown king cobra, sending his friend into a panic.Remarkably, he has done this wide-ranging reading of his, in addition to the voluminous legal reading he has had to do as a lawyer and a judge. And he has been a deep reader, his intensely curious mind devouring facts and details. This is evident from his phenomenal memory that enables him to recite verbatim, even today, some lines from a Shakespeare play, an Art of War tenet, a Brahma sutra couplet or Sant Tukaram’s abhanga. He also remembers in exact words, even today, some strange or unique incident narrated to him by a friend decades ago.And this terrific memory of his also serves to make him an enchanting storyteller who embellishes his stories with quaint facts and colourful details. In lighter moments, his delightful sense of humour, too, comes out.Normally, one would expect such a diversely read person to be arrogant and snotty. Not him. If anything, he has a strange, endearing kind of humility. He is, more often than not, likely to effusively praise some accomplishment or special talent of one of his friends to others, sometimes much to the discomfiture of the person being praised.Another extraordinary quality is his fierce drive to improve things, to find solutions. He is not only constantly trying out new ideas, new concepts in his personal life but has no ego or hang-ups about enlisting the help and cooperation of anyone who might contribute to making things better. As he often says, “If it works, what does it matter where it comes from.”Sharadbhau is the only true Renaissance man I have come across, a Universal man — represented as an accomplished man, limitless in his capacity for development who embraces all knowledge and develops his own capacities as fully as possible. He is a true cosmopolite who views all human beings as just that, nothing more and nothing less. He is a deeply spiritual man who is impervious to the allure of the usually sought-after baubles: money, power, prestige, wealth, status, position, name and fame.As for his legal knowledge and expertise, that, undoubtedly, is his forte, both inherited and acquired.As for his integrity, honesty, incorruptibility, those are his inheritance, embedded in his DNA, passed down from an illustrious grandfather and an equally renowned father.And as for his fearlessness, it is the offshoot of his moral values and yogic qualities.And so, I am sure that under Sharadbhau’s stewardship we will see a throbbing, pulsating, questioning, prodding, vigorous, innovative, proactive, avant-garde judiciary.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73311354,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-56031,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/an-adult-who-has-not-lost-childlike-qualities/articleshow/73311355.cms

Thiruvananthapuram: It was a day meant to make them feel different. A host of cultural programmes, medical care and refreshments awaited them at the venue. However, on Palliative Care Observance Day, more than 1,250 patients under palliative care were made to wait for nearly two hours as the guests failed to turn up on time.

The occasion was ‘Arike-Saanthwana Sangamam 2020’ which was jointly organised by the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, Aardram campaign, the National Health Mission and the Department of Health Services of Kerala. The function was scheduled to be inaugurated by district panchayat president VK Madhu at 11am in the PKV Memorial Open-Air Auditorium at the Government Higher Secondary School for Girls in Cotton Hill and mayor K Sreekumar was to preside over the function. The organisers were forced to play songs one by one as both the guests were held up due to other commitments.

The patients started arriving at the venue from 10am in various ambulances from different parts of the district. A medical corner was set up to tend to their needs, in case of an emergency. Since the organizers were able to arrange entertainment programs and provide refreshments and food on time, it did not lead to any tense situation. Nevertheless, the long wait wore them out.

“They had told us earlier that the program will be held only in the evening. I cannot sit still for a long time. I don’t usually go out for functions. I am too weak for that, but since I was told it was a government programme, I decided to come,” said Kunjan from Kallara, a patient.

The organisers were left helpless. “The mayor’s office informed us that he had a function at Chackai. I don’t know why he is late. We had planned for a cultural event right after the inaugural function. Now, we will have to postpone the inaugural function after noon,” said Roy Jose, district coordinator of Palliative Care.

However, at 1:10pm, during the lunch break, the panchayath president arrived at the venue and immediately left, assuring the organisers to come back in the evening. When he was asked about being late for more than two hours, he replied: “I had to go to my ward due to an emergency”.

The vice-president of Thiruvananthapuram district panchayat, Shailaja Beegam had arrived on time. Since the function was getting late, she delivered her keynote address and left.

The car was allegedly involved in an accident, which claimed two lives, near Sasthamangalam on December 29

Thiruvananthapuram: Police have managed to track down the mysterious car and its driver who were allegedly involved in the accident near Sasthamangalam, that claimed two lives two weeks ago. The car, a brown Maruti Suzuki Zen Estilo , belongs to Sadanandan (47), a clerical staff of Raj Bhavan, who stays in its staff quarters. On Wednesday, police met Sadanandan and confiscated his car.

Museum SI (Crimes) Syamraj J Nair said that the car was tracked down after an elaborate probe. He also said that the owner turned out to be the same person who was caught on the surveillance camera installed at a shop near the accident spot. Earlier, police had circulated the visuals to locate the suspect. Police are yet to ascertain how the accident happened.

“Sadanandan claimed that his vehicle was not involved in the accident. He told us that he heard a loud noise while passing the spot and slowed down his car. He saw a youth who was flung in the air after a collision. He also saw a motorcycle without a rider rolling in front of his car (left to right) and then crashing onto a lamp post on the median. A passerby rushed to his vehicle and accused him of causing the accident. He claimed that he explained the sequence of events to that person and that person let him go as he was convinced that Sadanandan had not caused the mishap,” Nair said.

“He claimed that he was afraid to speak about the accident as he was afraid of the media trial. News reports had portrayed him as a villain, who knocked down two innocent youths and sped away,” he said.

Police found his car after compiling a list of all Zen Estilo cars registered in city. There were over 1,600 cars in the list. Police filtered the list down to those registered near Vellayambalam and Sasthamangalam region. They found that Sadanandan’s car was registered under the address of his residence at Raj Bhavan staff quarters and it matched the description of the suspected vehicle.

Earlier, police had received statement from witnesses that the car was brown in colour and the registration number started with the KL-20 series. When police approached Sadanandan, he admitted that he was indeed the one who was caught on the surveillance camera.

‘’We haven’t booked him as we need to ensure that his vehicle was involved in the accident. Hence, we have confiscated it. We will be seeking the service of forensic experts to examine it,” Nair said. Sadanandan was let off after his statement was recorded.

The accident occurred at 9pm on December 29. Online food delivery executive Abdul Rahim (44) from Nedumangad and Aditya B Manoj (21) from Sasthamangalam were killed in the accident.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a first in the country, the state government will soon introduce career and skill policies to enable the youth and students to develop and take their talents to higher levels and tap job opportunities awaiting them, said labour minister T P Ramakrishnan .

The minister who was inaugurating the district-level competitions of India Skills Kerala 2020 at Government ITI, Chackai, here said, “A seminar was conducted recently to discuss the draft for the career policy. The government is consolidating the suggestions that emerged from the deliberations to give final shape to the policy and announce them at the earliest. Steps are also afoot to draw up the state skill policy to open doors of opportunities for youngsters.”

Seeking to tap job opportunities that require various skills, the connect between the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and the industry has been strengthened. Thousands of placements are expected to be clinched through job fairs, placement cells and entrepreneurship clubs. For ITI trades, Spectrum 2020 Job Fair was conducted in all the 14 districts last week. As many as 641 companies turned up for that and 5,671 candidates were hired by various companies as trainees, he said.

The government’s approach is to find out each individual’s talent and encourage it and create opportunities. India Skills Kerala 2020 will give a fillip to these efforts. Around 16,293 contestants have registered for participating in the district-level competitions.

This marks a big jump from last year’s 7,422 participants. This shows the rising enthusiasm of students for receiving training in trades. The aim of the competitions is to enable the youth to give expression to their skills and encourage them to scale new heights, said Ramakrishnan.

NEW DELHI: It has been almost a month since traffic coming from Kalindi Kunj toll point has been hampered due to the protests at Shaheen Bagh . Municipal corporation officials say the blockage is now impacting operations at other border points by increasing the congestion.On an average, the border point receives 1,800 trucks every day. This entire traffic volume has now been diverted to other border points since the last month. The stretch between Mathura Road and Kalindi Kunj has been closed for traffic movement since last month over the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests in the area.A South Delhi Municipal Corporation official —the nodal agency for toll tax collection among three civic bodies — said that the revenue collection is not expected to be impacted as private toll collector is obliged to pay them Rs 1,200 crore annually. “The trucks that arrive in Delhi come on demand basis, as non-destined vehicles have to pay both toll tax and environment compensation cess mandated by the Supreme Court. We are diverting such vehicles to DND border and other nearby entry points. This is causing jams on other toll points,” the official said.Delhi has 124 border points and Kalindi Kunj toll is among the busiest ones. A 15-day long traffic inflow analysis commissioned by the municipal corporation last year had shown that the toll point has an overall weekly tax collection potential of more than Rs 12.4 crore. The study had shown that border point receives 2,963 double-axle trucks and 3,471 triple-axle trucks. It also gets more than 4,038 double-axle light commercial vehicles and 1,871 four-axle heavy trucks. This entire volume is now diverted to other borders.While municipal officials are expecting that the Shaheen Bagh-blockade will not cause any revenue loss for the corporations, the past experiences show that private toll tax collection agency can ask for exemption and reduction in the obligatory amount it has to pay. Last month, the private toll collector had sought similar exemption of Rs 240 crore in the lieu of commercial vehicles running away through free lanes during the enforcement of RFID system.The women’s protest at Shaheen Bagh has attracted nationwide public attention. It had started on December 15 with a group of 50 residents who took to the roads and blocked the traffic. Besides Gate number 7—the main protest point in Jamia university — Shaheen Bagh has served as the second key site for the anti-CAA protests in the region.On Sunday, a large number of people had staged a protest in Delhi’s Sarita Vihar, demanding the removal of barricades that have been placed on the road linking Mathura Road and Kalindi Kunj for the past few weeks.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73285322,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-222007,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shaheen-bagh-takes-toll-on-other-border-points/articleshow/73281531.cms

Sonia Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Former Delhi minister Rajkumar Chauhan , who had switched to BJP immediately after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, is all set to return to Congress.

Chauhan, who represented Mongolpuri assembly constituency four times from 1993 to 2013, met interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi at her residence on Wednesday where he agreed to work for the party in the upcoming assembly polls. He, however, added that no discussion on his candidature took place at the meeting, which was also attended by Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra.

“I was called to Sonia ji’s office to meet her. We had a long discussion about the upcoming polls. I told her I will follow her orders and work for the party in whatever capacity she wants me to,” said Chauhan, who held important portfolios in Sheila Dikshit’s cabinet.

Meanwhile, Delhi Congress functionaries also said that he might officially rejoin in a ‘couple’ of days.

Chauhan was tipped to contest the last Lok Sabha election on a Congress ticket from the reserved constituency of North West Delhi but was reportedly denied just before the nominations were to be filed. He joined BJP a month later in May 2019.

Sources said Chauhan was shortlisted by BJP and was set to contest the upcoming assembly election from the reserved seat of Mongolpuri. His sudden exit may disturb BJP’s calculations. He was also made the co-convener of the manifesto committee of Delhi BJP.

While BJP sources said Chauhan was not picking up the phone to clear the air about his meeting, the Dalit leader said he had informed the organisational secretary and Delhi unit chief about his decision to not contest the upcoming polls.

The party election wing chief, Balwant Singh Bhauryal, issued the notification for the state chief election and on Thursday two senior party leaders — vice president Shivraj Chauhan and Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal — would make the final announcement.

BJP insiders said that the party’s central leadership has made its mind to handpick a legislator which means the MPs and contestants having experience of organisation working of the saffron fold are unlikely to be considered.

Thiruvananthapuram: Thousands of devotees, Vedic scholars and tourists from across Kerala and from neighbouring states thronged Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple here on Wednesday to witness Lakshadeepam marking the conclusion of Murajapam, a 56-day long and centuries-old ritual.

By 6pm, the temple and its entrance tower shone in golden colour with traditional earthen lamps, revolving oil lamps and electrical lamps.

Being the first Murajapam and Lakshadeepam (lighting of one lakh oil lamps) after Supreme Court took over the management of the temple, there was strict security on the premises.

Despite this, devotees, including elderly people, thronged the temple to have a glimpse of this once-in-a-six-year event and to pay respect to their Lord Padmanabha, the main deity of the temple.

Malathyammal, 82, of Aryasala, who arrived at the temple along with her grandchildren, said she has been witnessing Murajapam and Lakshadeepam from the age of 12.

“Participating in the 56-day-long ritual and witnessing its finale Lakshadeepam was our favourite timepass during my childhood, which now had turned into a serious devotion. At that time, we used to light the lamps. Once you attend the ritual and witness its culmination, I swear next time one cannot resist to be a part of it. Over these years, I have only missed one Lakshadeepam. This year due to health issues, my son asked me to stay at home and see it live on television. But I emotionally convinced him by telling that I don’t know whether I will be alive for next Lakshadeepam,” said Malathyammal.

Nussrath Beevi, 55, from Malappuram said she has been witnessing Lakshadeepam since 1984. “My best friend Thara is a native of Enchaykkal and it was through her I witnessed Lakshadeepam for the first time at the age of 36. Since then, it is kind of a reunion to us and we attend every Lakshadeepam together. This time I took my daughter-in-law too,” said Beevi.

For Kinjal Mehra from Maharashtra, who arrived at the temple along with her five friends, it was the crowd and the chanting of mantras that attracted them to the festival. “On Monday, we reached Thiruvananthapuram to attend my friend’s bachelor party in Kovalam. When we went through the area on Tuesday evening, we saw thousands gathered here for Murajapam. Through an organizer, we heard about illumination of one lakh lamps and didn’t want to miss this opportunity. But we failed to obtain entry pass, but are happy to see it from outside,” Mehra said.

NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday directed Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), Nagpur Improvement Trust ( NIT ), Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) and Armors Builders to pay Rs10 lakh each towards expenses of its expert committee to study electrocution cases.

The HC also asked both civic bodies and power utility to recover the cost from violators who illegally constructed their homes flouting all rules.

The directives came while hearing a suo motu PIL based on TOI reports on death of 11-year-old twins Priyansh and Piyush Dhar and five-year-old Umesh Pande due to electrocution from HT wires in June 2017.

The experts panel is working under convener Gauri Venkatraman, who’s also president of High Court Bar Association (HCBA). The panel having experts from civic and power entities has so far submitted five reports which bared massive violation of rules.

In last hearing, the NMC informed that it had partially demolished 79 out of 432 illegal structures, whose portions were coming directly under the HT wires. It further informed that it has received as many as 16 applications from 22 violators who have expressed willingness to share the cost of remedial measures.

Bombay high court’s Nagpur bench on Tuesday issued a notice to BJP’s Hingna MLA Sameer Meghe on a plea filed by former MLA Vijay Ghodmare challenging Meghe’s victory in the last year’s assembly polls held in October. He was asked to file reply before February 14.

According to petitioner, large scale bogus voting took place in Hingna constituency which helped Meghe win the seat comfortably. After researching the voters’ list, it came to light that almost 50,000 fake voters cast their vote in the constituency. Even after complaining to election officer several times, no action was taken forcing the former MLA to knock judiciary’s doors through counsels — Anand Deshpande and Alpesh Deshmukh.

A Delhi police barricade

NEW DELHI: Rumours of police action led to a near standoff between police and anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protesters at Khureji village in east Delhi early on Wednesday.

A team of cops had reached the site following information about a scuffle between the protesters and another group which was supporting the implementation of the CAA. Upon reaching the place, the cops found that no such incident had taken place there. But the agitators suddenly started accusing police of high-handedness and this led to a tense situation for a while. Senior officers had to intervene to pacify the protesters.

DCP (Shahdara) Amit Sharma said that the matter was resolved immediately and there were no incidents of violence or attack on the policemen. “We have asked the organisers to maintain peace at the venue,” he said.

Senior police officers said that they are looking for a solution to avoid any further confrontation between the two groups.

Khalid Saifi, co-founder of United Against Hate, said that police had called him to enquire about the protest. “I informed them that the women of the village were the ones carrying out the protest, and then I came back home. Meanwhile, my wife had received a call from a protester who alleged that the lights at the venue were switched off and the cops were trying to break the tent. However, when I reached the site, things were normal,” said Saifi.

Sara Javed, one of the organisers of the protest, said: “We have been sitting here peacefully since Monday. On Wednesday, the lights suddenly went off. Women are staying here with their children and they got scared. Policemen tried to disperse us, but they left after we stood in protest.”

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: City police busted a four-member gang, including two women, who allegedly enticed and robbed men. Police identified the accused as Nazeer (33) and Aslam (25) of Beemapally; Sheeja (35) from Pallithura and Bindu (35) from Rajaji Nagar. Their arrests were recorded at Fort police station on Wednesday.

Police said the accused persons were arrested based on a complaint filed by a young man who fell into their trap. As per the complaint, the alleged crime took place on Sunday night. The women approached him as he was passing by Ajantha Theatre road and invited him into an auto rickshaw. As soon as he entered the vehicle, the two men in the gang attacked and overpowered him, while the auto was on the move.

The gang took Rs 7,500 and a mobile phone worth Rs 11,000 from the complainant and left him near Pulimood Junction on MG Road. He immediately approached the police and filed a complaint.

Police conducted an investigation, examined visuals from surveillance cameras installed along roads and identified the suspects. On Wednesday, police took them into custody. Police recovered the stolen money and mobile phone from the accused. The arrests were made by a team led by Fort station house officer inspector AK Sherry, SI S Vimal and SI B Jaya.

Sherry said the main accused, Aslam, was involved in a few robbery cases. All the four accused used to roam around East Fort region at nights. Hence, police could identify them easily from surveillance camera visuals. They were taken into custody from different parts of East Fort, he said.

All the accused were produced in court and remanded in judicial custody later.

Vikram Bhosale holds the manja in his right hand that the rescued eagle was entangled in

PUNE: Manja, the banned glass coated kite string, continued to injure birds and animals this Makar Sankranti , city-based wildlife and animal rescuers said.

On Wednesday, the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Research Centre was swamped with bird emergencies caused by sharp kite strings, a zoo official said.

Vikram Bhosale, a volunteer with Wildlife Welfare Association, Pune, on Tuesday rescued an eagle stuck on a tree after it had got entangled in kite string. The bird was later released.

“I got a call on Tuesday around 1.30pm about the eagle stuck on a 100-ft tree. It was entangled in kite string since 6am. The Chinese nylon manja had cut through its wing and stomach. I called the fire brigade, but their ladder could not reach the height. A woodcutter climbed the tree and lopped off the branch upon which the bird was stuck. We cut the manja and the bird was sent for treatment to the Katraj zoo,” Bhosale added.

He has looked into 16 cases in the last two days involving manja-related injuries to birds, dogs, cats among other animals. He also rescued a cat ensnared in manja in a building in Alandi on Tuesday and another dog entangled in it in Wagholi on Wednesday.

Veterinary surgeon at Indian Herpetological Society Suchitra Suryavanshi Patil, who works at the animal rescue shelter and snake welfare park in Katraj, told TOI that there has been a surge in manja-related bird injury cases since a month.

“We were swamped with these cases on Wednesday. Chinese manja is very sharp and is glass-coated. So it can easily cut through the bird’s wings and skin. We have been receiving cases of injured eagles and black shouldered kites, both Schedule I species,” she said.

Patil said the manja string had cut through the left wing of a black shouldered kite which had resulted in profuse bleeding. “We will have to take an X-ray to check for bone injuries as well. The bird’s survival chances are 50-50 as there has been massive blood loss,” she said.

Arvind Salve, another wildlife and bird rescuer, said he has been receiving over three to six calls each day since the last one month reporting manja-related bird injuries.

“On Wednesday, we tried to rescue a badly injured kite in Gokhalenagar. The manja had cut through her wing and the bird had been stuck on a tree for three days. The kite later succumbed to injuries,” he said. Most manja-related injuries are being reported in birds like kites, eagles, wild pigeons and crows, he added.

PUNE: It is still too soon to know how severe this season will be, but swine flu claimed its first victim in the city and the state this year on January 10.The 40-year-old man from the rural parts of Satara died after he tested positive for the contagion at KEM Hospital in Rasta Peth.Currently, a 64-year-old woman of Sangvi in Pune is critical and undergoing treatment at the intensive care unit of Sahyadri Hospital in the city.As many as six patients from Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane and Pune have tested positive for the virus in Maharashtra between January 1 and January 13, this year.Symptoms of swine flu are similar to a common cold and people often take it lightly in the initial stages till it turns critical.In 2019, as many as 2,287 people in the state were diagnosed with the H1N1 infection. Of them, 246 people succumbed to the contagion, accounting for a significant mortality rate of 10% calling for vigilance and also initiation of early treatment for influenza-like illness, say experts.“Scientists at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) confirmed the presence of H1N1 virus in the man's throat swab on January 2. He succumbed to swine flu-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with septicemia around 5.50am on January 10. He was diabetic,” a doctor from the KEM Hospital said.The deceased man was from Nirgudi village in Phaltan taluka of Satara district. He had developed influenza-like illness from December 24.“Initially, he had fever and cough. Later, he developed high grade fever with breathlessness. He was admitted to KEM hospital in Rasta Peth on December 28. Despite medication, the man's condition kept worsening. He was also kept on ventilator support during the course of treatment,” the doctor said.Experts say that since the symptoms of swine flu are quite similar to common cold, people often don’t take it seriously in the initial stages until it becomes critical.“A swine flu patient usually suffers from a burning sore throat, abdominal pain and cough and the additional symptom of shortness of breath.

Rajnath Singh

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Considering the increasing strategic importance of Indian Ocean Region (IOR), where all major powers of the world have established their bases, Indian Air Force (IAF) has decided to induct a maritime strike squadron – a fleet of Brahmos equipped Sukhoi-30 MKI – under the Southern Air Command (SAC).

Defence minister Rajnath Singh will dedicate the newly-resurrected 222 Squadron to the nation. It will become operational with Sukhoi-30 air superiority fighters, armed with indigenously-built BrahMos missiles, at the Air Force Station in Thanjavur on January 20, said Air marshal Amit Tiwari, also the Air officer Commanding-in-Chief at SAC, said on Wednesday.

Tiwari said it was incumbent upon the IAF to protect and defend ‘the IOR’s natural resources and the sea lines of communication for the nation’. “IOR, the third-largest waterbody in the world with a presence in 28 countries and 35% of world population, makes up 80% of seaborne oil transit. The region has many existing and potential conflict zones, including piracy. India, with a shoreline of over 7,500km and an exclusive economic zone of over 2.1 million sq km, has a huge stake here,” he said.

IOR has an important role to play in regional peace, security and prosperity, and IAF, an intrinsically strategic force, is all set to extend its reach, he added.

Initially, the new squadron under SAC will have four Sukhoi-30 MKIs and their numbers will increase, Tiwari said.

IAF, currently has 272 Sukhoi-30 MKIs (4th generation), ‘which are good as any other fighter’.

The Air Marshall said there were expansion plans in Thiruvananthapuram for which procedures are on to acquire more land. “The expansion could be realized in three to four years and this will be one major base from where we can operate,” he said.

Also present during the news conference were Group captain Prajul Singh, Station Commander, Thanjavur AF station and Group Captain Manoj Gera, Commanding Officer of Sukhoi-30 squadron.

Police sub-inspector P P Chavda

RAJKOT: Panic gripped city’s GSRTC bus stand when a 30-year-old spa owner died after a cop's service revolver accidentally went off inside the police chowky located within the depot premises on Wednesday.

The incident happened at Shastrinagar where a temporary ST bus stand has been functional for the past one-and-a-half years in wake of the old one being renovated.

Senior police officials said at around 4pm, deceased Himanshu Gohel, who was a friend of probationary police sub-inspector P P Chavda and had gone to hand over tickets for the India-Australia one-day match to be held on January 17.

""Chavda told us that the revolver went off accidentally when he was cleaning it. The bullet pierced through Gohel's forehead and he died on the spot,” said N K Jadeja, police inspector, A-division.

Gohel, who lived in Vrundavan Society on Ankurnagar Main Road, ran a spa in Malaviyanagar Chowk.

PSI Chavda of 2017 batch was deputed at the bus depot police chowky for the past six months. Chavda was immediately detained in A-division police station and the revolver was sent for forensic examination.

Ravi Saini, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), said, ""We are investigating the exact reason for the firing.""

The bus depot is extremely crowded with at least 1,000-15,00 people being present, especially during the day time. A huge crowd gathered outside the chowky as the news of the firing and death spread.

Representative image

PUNE: A family court in the city on Tuesday granted divorce by mutual consent to a techie couple barely eight days after they moved the petition.

“The court relied on a 2017 Supreme Court judgment, which held that the mandatory six-month cooling-off period, the norm for divorce by mutual consent, can be waived,” said lawyer Vikrant Shinde, who represented the woman in the case.

“The couple, in the instant case, have been living separately for over a year-and-a-half before they decided to apply for divorce by mutual consent,” he told TOI.

Shinde said, “As of yet, there is no known case prior to this in which a divorce by mutual consent was granted in such a short span. A few months ago, we had a case where divorce was granted in 13 days. The SC directives provide that the first date of hearing of a divorce plea by mutual consent cannot be granted inside eight days. As such, this appears to be the least term in which a divorce order has come through.”

“The couple were working with a leading IT firm in Pune when they got married in 2015. Later, they shifted to Bengaluru. They have no children. The couple had differences over many issues and would often quarrel before parting ways on June 30, 2018,” he said.

“The woman has since returned to Pune and taken up a job with an IT firm. The man continued with his job in Bengaluru. On January 6, they moved the divorce plea and it came up for hearing on Tuesday before family court judge SR Kafre. In between, they also went through a counselling process,” he added.

The flight (SG517), scheduled to depart from Goa at 2pm, was airborne around 4.20pm and arrived in the city at 5.15pm. “The flight was delayed because of a technical problem,” a SpiceJet spokesperson told TOI.

“Many passengers were going to Pune or Bengaluru to celebrate with their families and the delay frustrated them. We were told that the engineers were checking a technical issue, which led to a further delay,” a passenger said.

State police are continuing their probe to find whether the accused had received help from anyone within Kerala. However, top cops here remained tightlipped as the probe is being done by Tamil Nadu police.

State police have already questioned several persons as part of the probe. This includes relatives of Thoufeek who reside in Parassala region and the staff of a mosque at Neyyatinkara, where the two accused stayed hours before they allegedly committed the murder.

The Q branch officials of Tamil Nadu Police too had taken two men, who are known to Thoufeek and Abdul Shameem from the capital and Palakkad as part of the probe. Hence, police suspect that the accused might have received help from elements within the state and hence they are continuing the vigil.

Ahmedabad: Advanced systems installed at an ATM and alertness by a bank helped cops reach the ATM near Polytechnic in Ambawadi while two burglars were still busy cutting it in the wee hours of Wednesday.

At around 2.18am, the manager of State Bank of India (SBI) Polytechnic branch, Kuldeep Garg, 43, received a call from their Mumbai-based E-surveillance team informing him that two burglars had entered the ATM.

The surveillance team detected the men as burglars, as they were wearing helmets inside the ATM and covered the CCTV cameras with a cloth. Further, when they tried to tamper with sensors installed in the ATM the sensors sent a message to the e-surveillance team. The e-surveillance team also spotted gas-cutters in the hands of the two burglars and informed Garg.

On being warned of the crime in progress, Garg called up police control room and rushed there. When Garg reached there, he found the shutters of the ATM were closed. After a while, a police team also reached and opened the shutters. As the burglars heard the shutters being opened, they tried to flee but the police caught them, states the FIR.

The accused were identified as Aloksingh Rajput, 25, and Uttam Savalia, 32, who live in Punyakoti Apartment in Vejalpur area. Rajput and Savalia are partners in construction business, said an officer of Ellisbridge police.

They had tried to cut the machine with a gas-cutter due to which the ATM machine was filled with smoke. They damaged the ATM machine but failed to get any money from it. The two were also equipped with a screwdriver, a small gas cylinder and pliers.

AHMEDABAD: Is it possible now to type ‘Thank you’ without that tiny symbol of folded hands or proclaiming love without a string of yellow faces winking or blowing kisses or simply smiling while chatting with our near and dear ones?The ubiquitous emojis have taken the form of an independent language for the youth of today, claims a paper titled ‘Mapping Emoji Usage Amongst Youth’ by Dr Reena Shah, assistant professor with Indus University and Dr Ruchi Tewari, associate professor, MICA, at MICA ICMC 2020 recently.The study, which encompassed a focused group discussion (FDG) and subsequent survey, found that the emotive faces and pictorial representation of various objects are used extensively across the platforms for multiple purposes — ranging from conveying an emotion or mood to supplement, complement or substitute the central message in texts.“There were several revelations of the exercise — for a start, elderly were found to be using emojis in equal proportions, if not more. The primary reason for it is believed to be keeping up with the native users,” said professor Tewari.“What appears to be a casual pictorial addition to textual messages holds the power to be developed as a standalone language with its unique set of norms which could impact the usage of language-dependent communication,” states the paper.It’s no more a light-hearted exchange of symbols, claim researchers. In one of the instances, it cost a youth a relationship as he apparently did not use any appropriate emojis with a ‘Happy Birthday’ message. The recipient claimed that the message was just a formality for the sender, they added.“It is sometimes used as a replacement for language. It’s widely perceived that if a person is chatting just using emojis, he or she wishes to close a conversation. There are also etiquettes involved — if it’s a formal (social or professional) relationship, use of emojis is less and limited. But as the relationship gets matured, the usage gets extremely informal,” added Tewari. “Each individual has a unique pattern of using emojis including before, after or in between the text.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73285993,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-256975,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/evolving-emotions-behind-use-of-emojis/articleshow/73281719.cms

According to JP Solanki, Patan anti-corruption bureau (ACB) inspector, accused PSI Chetan Kumar Barot had seized liquor with a two-wheeler a few days ago.

Rajkot: The kite festival of Makar Sankranti was marked by three incidents of group clashes in Rajkot and Jamnagar on Tuesday. Also, 60 people were injured after banned manja strings came in contact with commuters’ throats in Rajkot city and district.

While in most of the injury cases, the patients were discharged from hospitals after preliminary treatment, three persons who received grievous injuries from manja and three others who fell off terraces while flying kites, had to be admitted to Rajkot Civil Hospital.

Four other persons were injured in a group clash that broke out between two communities in Shramjivi Society of Bedipara locality in Rajkot. Police said the clash was triggered by a petty matter of a member of the one group asking member of another not to talk loudly over phone.

“Ramzan Sheikh (22), Taufiq Sanghar (22), Imran Baloch (26), Bilal Mehtar (26) and Shahrukh Junaj (24) were arrested for allegedly leading a group of nine people to attack Mansukh Kolia, Hitesh Kolia, Mayur Kolia and Jayashree Kolia who were injured in the incident,” said G M Hadia, inspector with Thorala police station.

The second clash was reported from Shantinagar in Raiyadhar locality of Rajkot where one person was injured. “A group of eight people led by Dharmesh Rathod attacked Firoz Kherani (42) with knives after the latter objected to Rathod hurling abuses near his house. Irked at being reprimanded, Rathod stabbed Kherani in his back and stomach. He has been admitted to Rajkot Civil Hospital in a seriously injured condition,” said an official from University police station.

Police arrested Rathod, Sunil Rathod, Sanjay Parmar and Jai Makwana for the crime.

145,['16/01/2020'],Aromal aims for a Guinness record in Kalaripayattu,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Kannur: Aromal Ramachandran is just 22 and has already earned plaudits for wielding ‘ urumi ’ ( sword with flexible blade ) for five hours and four minutes. This earned him a place in the High Range Book of World Records on November 21, 2019 in the presence of officials from the organization based in Hyderabad with offices outside the country. Though the certificate was issued on December 24, it was formally handed over to him by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on January 13 at Thalassery.

Aromal, who learned Kalaripayattu from his father Ramachandran gurukkal at the age of three, decided to pursue his passion after completing his graduation in computer science. “I come from a family of Kalaripayattu practitioners; my father, mother (Shailaja), sister (Amrutha) and brother-in-law (Sanal) are professionally active in this field and hence it was natural for me to follow their path,” said the youth, who runs a kalari in Alappuzha.

Aromal’s mother, who also runs a kalari, was the first woman gurukkal to get recognition from the Sports Council in Kerala. “If Kalaripayattu is made a part of sporting activities and introduced in National Games, it would attract more people,” he said, adding that his family has training facilities in 17 states.

Aromal has now set his sight on a bigger prize. “My aim is to win a Guinness world record by performing for eight hours. For this, I should have a record first and there is no entry in the name of Kalaripayattu in the Guinness Book. Hence, I tried for High Range Book of World Records first,” said Aromal, for whom Kalaripayattu is a passion.

Ahmedabad: A 35-year-old man from the Saraspur area of the city allegedly murdered his wife’s paramour and dumped his body near Sterling City in Bopal on the outskirts of Ahmedabad in the wee hours of Wednesday.

The deceased was identified as Mayankgiri Goswami, 22, a resident of Ghuma, who worked at a private hospital in Bopal.

According to the complaint lodged by Bopal police, the accused, Alpesh Patel, threatened Mayankgiri a year ago.

On Tuesday evening, Mayankgiri received a call from some person and left home. When he got near Sterling City, Patel and four of his aides had abducted him and taken him to an unknown place.

As Mayankgiri was unreachable for the entire night, his cousin Kaushikgiri, a temple priest, went looking for him. At around 7am on Wednesday, Kaushikgiri saw people gathered around a body and found that the deceased was his cousin.

Mayankgiri had injuries on all over his body and had a deep wound on his head. On checking CCTV footage, police found that he had been abducted by Patel and his aide.

A police official said Patel may have killed Mayankgiri at some other place and dumped his body near his house. “Two days ago, Patel’s aide had warned Mayankgiri that he would be killed if he did not stop meeting Patel’s wife. Patel had learned about his wife’s relationship with Mayankgiri a year ago and had threatened to kill him,” said a police official.

At present, Bopal police registered a case of murder against Patel and began an investigation.

Police also claimed that they had inputs that ABVP members were also set to go to Vidyapith to oppose the anti-CAA protests.A Vadaj police team entered the Gujarat Vidyapith campus on Ashram Road and questioned students. Cops justified their action saying it was to avert clashes between the pro and anti-CAA factions.“We got a message from social media and a telephone call that Gujarat Vidyapith journalism students were going to fly kites with anti-CAA and anti-NRC messages on them. We also got a message that the RSS’s student wing, the ABVP (Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad), was also going to protest at Gujarat Vidyapith. In such a situation, we rushed to the varsity to maintain law and order,” said Rathwa.Students and alumni of the varsity objected to police action, terming it arbitrary. A student of Gujarat Vidyapith said that nine or ten cops came to the ground on the campus and began asking students for their identity cards. “The tone of the cops was also intimidating for the students. They spoke to us as if we were criminals even though we did not break any law,” said a student.A police official said, “We rushed there after seeing a message that some 30,000 such kites were going to be flown.

NEW DELHI: The government’s Central Vista revamp project may see shifting of Indira Gandhi National Centre of Arts (IGNCA) from its present location on Janpath to Jamnagar House , where around 15-acre land is currently occupied by hutments housing various government offices.As per the plan, the Prime Minister’s Office and residence will be located next to each other on Dalhousie Road, just behind South Block .While officials refused to comment on PM’s residence at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg after the revamp of Central Vista, sources said the government may continue to keep both the residential complexes earmarked for the PM. They added that the design of the project is still in the works and nothing has been finalised. TOI had on November 3 reported on the plan to bring PM’s residence closer to South Block.Sources said as per the plan, IGNCA will come up on around 15 acre land near Jamnagar House and the government has told the architect and design planner to ensure state-of-the-art facilities at the new IGNCA which will also have a National Centre for Performing Arts.The present IGNCA complex will pave way for new office blocks. The government has planned to build 10 new office blocks on both sides of Rajpath. “The new buildings will come up where the current buildings exist. We will not cut a single tree for this project,” an official said.The revamp plan also includes construction of a new triangular Parliament building next to the existing one, common central secretariat and the revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate. “The plan includes building several subways for safe movement of pedestrians and for office-goers there will be a transit system to transport them from Metro stations to each office building,” he said.Officials also said the new Parliament with seating capacity of around 1,000 MPs in Lok Sabha and 500 in Rajya Sabha will have more space for comfort of the law makers. The new Parliament will have seating in pairs instead of the current plan of a continuous row. “Each bench will have two MPs, though three members can also be accommodated. That will be enough to meet the requirement when a joint session is held in Lok Sabha,” said an official. The new Parliament won’t have a Central Hall.“Currently, you have over half a dozen MPs seating together and all members find it uncomfortable when a single MP goes out. The whole idea is to have a better functional complex that meets all requirement,” said an official.The official said the Central Vista revamp plan also includes extension of the Vista up to Yamuna, which was the original plan. “We will develop pedestrian walkways and cycle paths so that people can go up to the river and there will be a New India Garden on the river bank. The design of which would be finalised through a competitive process. Yamuna will also get cleaner by then,” he added.The ministry officials said there will be no dearth of fund for this project, which is being built for the next couple of centuries. “Obviously, this will be completely funded by the government since it will be the biggest beneficiary of the project,” a source said.North and South Blocks are likely to be converted into museums— one to capture history of India till 1857 and the other since the First war of Independence.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73293956,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-178017,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pms-office-and-residence-within-walking-distance/articleshow/73281665.cms

Malappuram: While child welfare authorities in Malappuram are engaged in a rigorous campaign to prevent child marriages across Malappuram, the ChildLine authorities have blocked the underage marriage of a 17-year-old girl in Tirurangadi.

The girl, who is a higher-secondary student , was produced before child welfare committee (CWC) and has been shifted to Snehitha shelter home in Malappuram. The ChildLine Malappuram has forwarded the case to police for further actions.

The action was initiated after the ChildLine received a complaint regarding the marriage through its toll-free helpline number. When ChildLine volunteers conducted an investigation based on the complaint, the girl revealed that her Nikah which was with a 30-year old-man was held recently and the marriage function is scheduled to be held after March. She had also revealed that the marriage was fixed without her consent. He had been married once before. Following this the ChildLine summoned parents of the girl and they were produced before CWC.

Child marriage prohibition office (CMPO) of Tirurangadi, P Prasanna said that the Nikah was conducted neglecting the warning issued by child welfare authorities and the case was handed over to Tirurangadi police for further action.

As per the statistics of Childline a total of 34 cases of child marriages were reported in Malappuram during the period of January to December, 2019. Recently the district child protection unit (DCPU) in association with women and child welfare department had launched a campaign with an aim to make Malappuram a child marriage-free district.

Shajesh Bhaskar, chairman of child welfare committee (CWC), said that the poor economic background of families is one of the major reasons for the child marriages in Malappuram. “Lack of awareness of parents especially those who are living in rural villages is also a reason for under-aged marriages”, he said. The district child protection unit (DCPU) has already appointed 30 child marriage prohibition officers and 90 supervising volunteers in various parts of the district, to report child marriages. The child marriage prohibition officers have the power to prevent any incident of under-aged marriage, register cases based on a complaint and to seek support of police to prevent the marriage function.

155,['16/01/2020'],‘State govt deceiving people on NH-766 issue’,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Kozhikode: The Nilgiris-Wayanad NH and Railway Action Committee , which has been spearheading the campaign to revoke the decade-old night traffic ban on the forest stretch of NH-766 passing through the Bandipur National Park , has said there were gross mistakes in the draft of the additional affidavit prepared by the state government to be filed in the Supreme Court demanding lifting of the ban.

The committee alleged that the state government was trying to once again deceive the people of Wayanad and was pitching for making the alternative Mananthavady-Kutta-Gonikuppa-Mysuru road as a permanent alternative to the NH-766. They said that while the draft of the affidavit says that the alternative road does not pass through any reserve forest or wildlife sanctuary, the fact is that it passes through two major wildlife sanctuaries in the states. The draft was recently circulated among the people’s representatives from Wayanad.

Committee convenor T M Rasheed said that the state government has also tried to present another road –– Panamaram-Payyambilli-Kutta-Gonikuppa –– as an alternative road in the draft of the additional affidavit. But it is clear that this road cannot be an alternative to NH-766 and it also passes through forests, he said.

“A lobby which has influence in the state government is trying to establish the Kutta-Gonikkupa road as a permanent alternative to the NH-766 so that it would result in better road connectivity from the Kannur airport to Kodagu and Mysuru even if it is at the cost of the permanent closure of NH-766,” he added.

The earlier affidavit submitted by the Kerala government in December had sparked a controversy after it emerged that the affidavit was submitted a day before the ministerial level meeting was a held in Thiruvananthapuram to finalise the points to be included in the affidavit.

After the legislators from Wayanad raised the issue, it was decided that an additional affidavit will be filed after consulting them.

The MLAs from Wayanad are expected to point out the mistakes in the draft of the revised affidavit before it is filed before the apex court.

The Supreme Court is set to consider the case next week. The affidavit of the state is crucial in the case as Supreme Court had in August asked the MoEF to submit a report on upgrading NH-275 and SH-90 (alternative route from Wayanad to Mysuru through Kutta and Gonikuppa) so that the NH-766 can be closed down in the long run.

NEW DELHI: AAP MP Sanjay Singh on Wednesday got into a confrontation with BJP parliamentarian Gautam Gambhir alleging that the saffron party would stop free essential services, like electricity, water and bus rides for women, if it came to power in the capital.Hitting out at chief minster Arvind Kejriwal , Gambhir said that he was not against free services for poor, but those who could afford them should pay nominal charges. Singh alleged that BJP leaders were continuously opposing the free welfare schemes of the AAP government.Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari joined in by saying that no existing subsidy started by the AAP government would be altered. He alleged that AAP leaders were “habitual liars” and “misrepresented the facts” to suit their political interests.“I have repeatedly said that we will give five times the benefits given by the AAP government. Several central schemes like Ayushman Bharat and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, which were stopped by the AAP government, would benefit people five lakh times, if implemented,” Tiwari said. Calling the AAP government’s free electricity and water scheme an election gimmick, Tiwari said the Kejriwal dispensation didn’t have any plans to give the facilities after March 31 as no such notification had been issued in this regard. “The order issued by the power department says consumers will get free electricity only till March 31. What we will give to people will be for 60 months,” he added.Singh challenged Gambhir to give up all the free facilities he received as an MP before opposing the benefits being provided to Delhiites. “Several BJP leaders have time and again conveyed their anti-development and regressive stance, including opposition to free basic services. It is good that their true intentions have been revealed before the election,” he added.The AAP leader stated that BJP MP Vijay Goel had recently announced that all free schemes would be stopped if his party comes to power. This was reiterated by Union minister Prakash Javadekar. “BJP leader Anil Jain stated that his party is against any kind of free services to people. Now, Gambhir has contradicted the claims made by Manoj Tiwari,” Singh said.“After coming to power again, the AAP government will continue the free services for the next five years. The inflation rate has been consistently rising due to the unfavourable policies of the central government. Instead of focusing on resolving inflation, they have been criticising the AAP government. In the current economic scenario, the free welfare schemes have provided a huge relief to people,” Singh stressed.New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi said BJP will spell out all benefit schemes it intends to launch in its election manifesto. “BJP will bring better schemes,” she added.

NEW DELHI: On December 28, police found an unidentified body in Dwarka . The next day, a woman approached the northeast Delhi police saying that her husband was missing. Apparently, the two incidents had no connection as reported from two distant corners of the city.

However, Delhi Police’s Crime Branch has claimed that the man found dead in Dwarka was Mohammed Dilshad — murdered by his wife and her lover. DCP (crime) Rajesh Deo said the woman, identified as Bilkis Begam and her lover, Sabir Ali, have been arrested. Ali’s friend Rohit, who helped them in the crime, has also been arrested. Dilshad and Ali were cousins.

Deo said that the breakthrough was achieved after head constables Sudhir and Parveen received a tip-off from an informer that a person reported missing from Nand Nagri was murdered and his wife may be involved in the crime. A probe was initiated and cops got to know that Bilkis was involved in a relationship with Ali.

Officers detained Ali and questioned him. He gave conflicting answers in the beginning but later confessed to the crime. Cops then arrested Bilkis and Rohit. Cross examination revealed that Ali and Blikis hatched a plot to eliminate Dilshad and roped in Rohit by promising him Rs 1 lakh for helping in the murder.

On December 27, Rohit called Dilshad, a caterer by profession, to a vacant plot in Dwarka on the pretext of giving him a contract for a wedding. Ali was already hiding at the spot. While Rohit tied a wire around Dilshad’s neck, Ali attacked him with an awl. Later, they dumped the body in the bushes.

KOLKATA: A private bus conductor , Sajal Halder (36), was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly pushing a woman off the bus after the two had an altercation over Rs 2 .

The incident occurred near B C Roy Children’s Hospital on Wednesday afternoon, when the victim had boarded the Route 44 bus, plying between Baguiati and Howrah.

The woman, a resident of Lake Town, lodged a complaint at the Beliaghata police station that the conductor had demanded Rs 9 from her when the fare was Rs 7. She reportedly refused to pay the extra Rs 2 and this led to an altercation between the two. The conductor allegedly outraged her modesty and pushed her off the bus, her complaint stated.

Halder, a resident of Rajarhat’s New Colony area, was later arrested and the police seized the journey sheet of the bus. He has been charged under IPC Section 354 and different sections of the West Bengal Motor Vehicles Act.

Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said the woman’s statement would be recorded before a magistrate at the earliest. “We are looking into all aspects, including the fact that the accused might have had committed such a crime earlier,” he said.

Such incidents prompted the police to ask private bus owners to install CCTV cameras like on WBTC buses. “If we have video evidence, we can probe such cases better,” said the officer.

Rajkot: A man poisoned his brother-in-law to death in order to usurp his property in Bhawaninagar locality in Rajkot. Though the incident occurred on August 24 last year, the complaint in this connection was lodged on Monday night after receiving the viscera report.

Police said the accused, identified as Ashwin Dodia along with his friends Naresh Sarvaiya and Amit Chauhan, offered poisonous alcohol to Devubha Sakaria (26).

“According to the complaint lodged by Sakaria's father Ramesh Sakaria (65), Dodia intended to usurp the property of Sakaria, hence he plotted his murder,” said N K Jadeja, inspector with Rajkot A division police station.

Ramesh is a multi-millionaire owning land, plots, a restaurant and a bungalow. Sakaria was his only son after eight daughters, who was likely to inherit his property.

Ramesh alleged that Dodia was eyeing his property and had hatched the conspiracy to kill Sakaria.

“On the night of the crime, after Sakaria consumes liquor laced with poison, the accused brought him to Ramesh’s restaurant and told him that Sakaria was heavily drunk. They arranged a folding bed for Sakaria in the restaurant where they had dinner and left the place. However, when Ramesh tried to wake Sakaria up, he found him dead,” added Jadeja.

Meanwhile, viscera reports confirmed presence of poisonous substance in the alcohol. On the basis of the viscera reports, murder complaints have been registered and the police have launched a manhunt for the accused.

An advance team from US inspects the historic Taj Mahal

AGRA: About 30 security personnel from the United States , along with their 25 Indian counterparts, visited the Taj Mahal on Wednesday for a security review ahead of the proposed visit of US President Donald Trump to Agra in February.

The advance team arrived in Agra on a special flight and went back in the evening after visiting the Taj Mahal. They inquired in detail about the venue, security forces deployment, cameras placement, public movement and details of the last visit of VVIPs to the monument. They also checked various routes and golf cart facility on the monument’s campus.

According to sources, once the visit of the US President is finalized, the security arrangement will involve an intense ground-to-air paraphernalia to ensure that there is no untoward incident during the visit of the world's most guarded leader.

ASI’s superintending archeologist (Agra circle) Vasant Swarankar said that no one from the US team contacted him officially, but confirmed that some persons from the American embassy inquired about the monument from the ASI staff.

A security personnel team from US will be camping here for almost two weeks before the VVIP visit, said a senior official. He, however, did not confirm who would be visiting the monument.

According to reports, the US and India are in touch to work out mutually convenient dates for the visit of US president Donald Trump. India had invited Trump to grace the Republic Day parade as the chief guest last year but the US President could not come due to scheduling issues.

""Both sides are in discussions to finalise the dates,"" said a source. During his visit to the US in September last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reminded Trump of his invitation to him to visit India along with his family.

Aligarh: Aligarh MP Satish Gautam has said that the AMU VC’s and Registrar’s futile bid to file an FIR against security forces was an afterthought and aimed at misleading the investigating agencies.

He said that while the university authorities on one hand had allowed police inside the campus, on the other hand they are filing complaints against them for what they legitimately did inside to disperse the violent mob. He said that VC and the registrar have woken up after a month to register a complaint, which itself is questionable.

He said on the ill-fated day, DIG Preetinder Singh and security personnel were also injured during the violence and they had resorted to use of force in self defence.

Praising the district police action, the MP said that if police had not controlled the situation on December 15, anything could have happened. He said educational institutions are for imparting education not for protests and “gundagardi”. He said that police doesn’t need any permission for maintaining law and order situation in the town.

The MP said that he has urged the government to check the university’s hostels completely and allow entry from one gate only in order to block illegal access of people inside the campus. He warned the VC that if he registers an FIR against security personnel then another FIR will be registered against him for allow students to shout anti-national slogans in the campus.

With the skill development mission, PM Modi has opened up new avenues for the youth,” Shah said.

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, and deputy CM Manish Sisodia at a party office, in New Delhi on Monday (ANI photo)

New Delhi: With AAP taking a lead over other key players, announcing its full list of 70 candidates for the assembly polls on Wednesday, the party has started expanding its campaign on the ground. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is likely to file his nomination from New Delhi assembly constituency on January 20. His deputy, Manish Sisodia , will file his papers from Patparganj on Thursday itself, followed by transport minister Kailash Gahlot (Najafgarh) a day later.

Both Kejriwal and Sisodia are eying a hat-trick from their respective assembly segments. AAP has repeated all the ministers from their respective seats.

Young gun Raghav Chadha launched his campaign in Rajendra Nagar even as MP Sanjay Singh inaugurated an election office at Naraina Vihar. Party supporters were joined in by hordes of locals as they danced to the tunes of AAP’s campaign song, “lage raho Kejriwal”. Chadha told the gathering: “I won’t become an MLA alone. We will all become MLAs. I was born in Rajendra Nagar and not only my parents but also my entire family lives here. My mother’s family is also from Naraina Vihar and the whole of the area is like a family to me.” A local Congress worker joined AAP at the event, saying she was impressed by Kejriwal’s work.

Chadha is now planning a door-to-door campaign and ‘padyatras’ to seek votes. Party functionary Atishi, fielded from Kalkaji, meanwhile, began her campaign by seeking blessings at Kalkaji Mandir.

The confirmation of a party ticket has reinvigorated Model Town candidate Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, who had faced some protests recently. “All sections of people have come out in my support and they are campaigning for me,” Tripathi said. Matiala candidate Gulab Singh said he was undertaking door-to-door campaigns every day, covering more than 20 kilometres. Okhla candidate Amanatullah Khan will have a “silent” nomination. “In the wake of the Shaheen Bagh protest, I have decided not to carry out any procession or bike rally. I will go from door to door to seek votes,” Khan said.

With AAP making development its main poll plank, the candidates are focusing on their campaigns accordingly. Volunteers have been asked to take AAP government’s report card of five years to the doorsteps of the people.

Representative image

ALIGARH: A day after the Aligarh Muslim University ( AMU ) authorities claimed that the Aligarh police had refused to accept their complaint for registration of an FIR against security forces for their highhandedness at Morrison court Hostel on December 15, DIG Aligarh on Wednesday said that no such complaint had been received from the varsity.

Talking to TOI, DIG Aligarh Akash Kulhary said that the varsity has not given any such complaint till date. He said that it was wrong to say that the police had refused to accept the complaint, as without investigations they cannot refuse or accept any application. He refused to comment further on the issue.

However, registrar of the university, Abdul Hamid, claimed that the cops refused to receive their application “verbally”. He said that no one can force them to accept or reject the application in writing.

According to a senior police officer, if the university claims that police had rejected their application verbally then they could have sent it by a registered post. However, university officials did not comment on this and said that they will discuss about it. So far, they have not decided anything in this regard.

Police said that no separate FIR would be registered even if they receive the application, since a FIR has already been registered in this matter, so it will be only forwarded to the investigation team.

A senior administrative official in the university claimed that police is diverting the issue, as they don’t want any case against security personnel.

Earlier, on Tuesday, varsity VC Tariq Mansoor had clarified that the university administration had given permission to police to “only restore normalcy and restore public order and to clear the main road” and that they were “not supposed to enter any residential hostel”. He had added that evidence brought to the knowledge of the university administration suggests that the “police personnel might have crossed their mandate by entering the Morrison Court hostel premises”.

177,['16/01/2020'],Nagpur: Police in quest of ‘white Bullet man’ in mayor firing case,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Representational image

NAGPUR: Multiple city police teams are on the lookout for a man in a white leather jacket riding a white Bullet in the mayor Sandip Joshi firing case. The man is reportedly one of the two helmet-wearing bike-borne shooters who fired three rounds on Joshi’s car in December last year.

Joshi, who had received two threat letters for his anti-encroachment drive , was with his friend Aditya Thakur in his personal car when he was fired upon near Empress Palace banquet hall on the Outer Ring Road.

City police have questioned notorious goons with firing cases against their names, but have been unable to find any connection.

Cops have also tried to reach out to their inter-state counterparts, including the Chitrakoot-based syndicate which had fired upon hawala traders Lakhotia brothers in 2008. The crime syndicates based at Kanhan, Kamptee, Khaparkheda and such places — who use firearms or deal in them — too have been scrutinized, but there has been no headway.

With cyber experts having to scan through lakhs of mobile phone numbers at critical stretches between different strategic towers, the city police top brass are trying to stress more on criminal intelligence to narrow their focus on suspects who prefer leather jackets and Bullet bikes — especially white ones.

It is learnt that the ‘ white Bullet man ’ was captured on CCTV cameras at two different places where the threat letters to Joshi were posted. The police have passed on the 'white Bullet and leather jacket' theory to their crime information network, along with the video footage to some key contacts.

The police are yet to figure out why the sharp shooters used helmets to hide their identities. ""Why did they wear helmets at a place where there is no CCTV coverage? Does that mean that the shooters were worried that Joshi or Thakur might identify them, or was it done for the purpose of dramatization?” pondered a cop.

In a recent interview, Joshi said that he would demand a CID or CBI probe if the case was not solved soon.

Three years ago, architect Eknath Nimgade’s murder case was transferred to CBI, but nothing has come of it till date.

On Makar Sankranti at around 5.26am, gang rape victim gave birth to baby girl in Firozabad district hospital.

FIROZABAD: A glance out of Firozabad district hospital ’s window sent shivers down the spine of Surya (name changed) who was firmly holding her newborn she can’t call her own outside.

Staring at an uncertain future and an “unsparing” society, the 16-year-old rape survivor has decided to part ways with girl child she just gave birth to. Hired as a contractual teacher at a kindergarten school at a meagre salary of Rs 3,000 a month, she was allegedly gang-raped by her principal and her co-worker - who used to call her ‘beti’- in May last year.

Turning her gaze away from the child, Surya told TOI that she doesn’t have the means and the courage to keep her. “I kept her in my womb for nine months. Though she is my part and I love her, I don’t have the means to take care of her and neither the society will accept us. I have decided to leave my daughter in orphanage,” Surya said.

She has just one hope. “Someday, someone will adopt her and she will get a better life.”

Hidden from the society for the last several months in a small rented room, Surya was admitted to district hospital after the intervention of TOI and child welfare committee (CWC) Firozabad on late Tuesday night.

Hailing from a poor family with no father, the girl was eldest among two siblings and had joined private school to support her family.

“I wanted to become a police officer. But due to financial constraints joined the kindergarten school. I was raped by the school principal and a colleague for several times inside the school basement. They filmed the act and continued to threaten me of dire consequences if I reported the matter,” said the survivor. She added, “Those two men are vultures.”

In the FIR lodged at Shikohabad police station of Firozabad district, the accused were identified as Harveer, 29, the school principal and Rameshwar, 38, the teacher and colleague of the girl. The duo were charged under IPC section 376-D (gang rape), 506 (criminal intimidation) and under POCSO Act. They were arrested and sent to jail.

“Seeing the family’s financial condition, Rameshwar, who used to call my daughter ‘beti’, offered to provide a job of teacher with Rs 3,000 per month in local kindergarten school. My daughter joined the school in September 2017. But, in May 2019, on pretext of giving her advance teacher’s training, he raped her inside school premises. Couple of days later, the school principal Harveer too raped her,” said survivor’s mother.

“It was in September 2019, I came to know about my daughter’s condition after she fainted,” said the 37-year-old woman, with tears rolling down her eyes.

“I was hurt and shocked to see Rameshwar’s wife and Harveer’s mother plead to spare the two accused for money. I don’t understand, how as women, they can be so heartless towards a girl who was victim of brutality,” added the survivor’s mother who runs her family by stitching clothes.

Meanwhile, speaking to TOI, chief medical officer Dr Sadhana Rathore of Firozabad district hospital said, “The baby and the victim are in good health. Our team is providing constant care to the duo. I am also writing to SP Firozabad to provide adequate security cover to the survivor and her child till the court trial in gang-rape is going on.”

Zafar Alam, Firozabad’s child welfare committee member said, “Soon the district administration will deposit Rs 3.5 lakh as compensation amount into the survivor’s bank account, as almost all paper work has been completed. We respect her decision. The gang-rape survivor will file an appeal in court asking to put the baby for adoption via CARA (Central Adoption Resource Authority).”

Taking cognizance of the case, ADG Agra zone Ajay Anand and IG Agra range Satish Ganesh, also extended help to the survivor. “We have asked civil society members to make financial contribution in order to help the victim, as she is from poor background. Every possible help would be provided to the teenager and her child by police,” said ADG Ajay Anand.

Sambalpur: Though a target was set to complete construction of the building, which will house the offices of Sambalpur Municipal Corporation (SMC) and Sambalpur Development Authority (SDA), by December last year, the work is far from completion.

The work on the building, which will be a replica of the Hirakud Dam, had started in November 2017. A Sambalpur-based firm is executing the building work. The four-storey building for the two offices is being constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 14.89 crore. A Kolkata-based architectural firm prepared the detailed project report (DPR) and design of the four-storied building. All the required facilities to run the two offices will be available in the composite office building, construction of which is being executed by the SMC itself.

An official of the SMC said the building was completed structurally. However, the finishing work is yet to be carried out.

Enforcement Officer of SMC, Subhankar Mohanty admitted that a target was set to complete the work on the building by December. However, he said, due to fund constraint, the pace of the work had slowed down and as a result the work could not complete before the deadline. However, the problem has been resolved and the work s going on in full swing now. It will take some time for the completion of the work, he said.

At present, the office of the SMC is operating from the building, where the office of the Sambalpur Municipality was running. The Sambalpur municipality was constituted in the year 1867. And the existing office building of the Sambalpur municipality was constructed in the year 1927. However, Sambalpur was accorded corporation status in the year 2014. But the existing building of the Sambalpur municipality does not have sufficient space to accommodate all the sections of the municipal corporation.

Volunteers attend to injured birds at one of the many camps in Vadodara.

VADODARA: At least 465 birds were injured by kite strings on Uttarayan in the city on Tuesday and Wednesday. The injured birds included some uncommon varieties as well as migratory birds.

The state government has, for the first time, started the Karuna Abhiyan in the city to ensure that injured birds are rescued and treated as part of coordinated efforts. Government veterinary clinics, forest officials and NGOs were actively involved in the entire process.

Forest department officials said that 305 injured birds were brought to the three facilities started at veterinary clinics in the city on Tuesday. On Wednesday, another 160 were brought for treatment till early evening and the numbers are expected to rise till night.

District forest officer Kartik Maharaja said that 38 camps were started at various locations across the city. “This time 200 more volunteers were working in these camps this year compared to last year’s 500,” he said. According to Maharaja, a major change observed this year was people rushing to the camps with injured birds.

Till Tuesday, 445 injured birds were treated under the Karuna Abhiyan camp that started on January 10. The figures for Wednesday, were being collected by volunteers and officials till the night.

A major respite for birds was the low breeze on Tuesday evening ensuring a lesser number of kites in the sky. “The situation, however, changed on Wednesday evening and we will have to wait for the details of injured birds till Thursday,” said Vishal Thakur, a wildlife and animal rescue activist.

Arvind Pawar, another animal rescue activist, too pointed out that the number of birds injured on Wednesday evening may be higher than Tuesday. “My group was operating from six locations and got several calls on Wednesday evening,” he said.

Apart from pigeons and other common birds, Spoon Bill, Northern Shoveler, Common Kestrel and other species were also rescued during the festivities. From January 10 till Tuesday, 71 birds died before they could be treated.

The autopsy revealed that apart from a gunshot wound, Duhan did not have any indication of a scuffle on his body. “There was a single bullet wound on his temple that was fired from a close range. Someone had noticed him lying on the footpath and informed police about it,” said his brother Sunil.

Police failed to find any eyewitness or a CCTV footage during their probe.

“It is unlikely that my brother would have been murdered due to an enmity,” said Sunil.

Family members say that a day before the incident he had returned with his family to Delhi. “He was on leave for 15 days and was travelling to Chandigarh and Rohtak. If anyone was tracking him, they would not have been aware of his whereabouts,” said a family member.

The family members have urged eyewitnesses to come up with any clue that could help the cops crack the murder mystery.

Meanwhile, cops have detained a few local criminals from the Shahbad Dairy and Samaipur Badli areas. Anil’s mobile phone location is being tracked to get some clues. “We are probing into all possible leads to solve the case. Footage from the CCTV cameras along the road are being scanned,” said a police officer.

183,['16/01/2020'],"Rly job racket that duped more than 1,000 aspirants busted","This story is from January 16, 2020

Bhopal: Bajaria police on Wednesday busted a major fake Railways job racket that was being operated in the city and nabbed two members of the gang, including the kingpin, a terminated policeman, and his nephew. Four members of the gang are still at large.

Police said that the accused duped more than 1,000 job aspirants on the pretext of jobs for the post of assistant station master at Rs25 lakh per candidate and ticket collector at Rs15 lakh per candidate. The accused were running the racket since the past 17-18 years and defrauded job aspirants to the tune of Rs80 to Rs90 crore.

The accused were operating a parallel fake railway training centre near Bhusawal railway junction in Maharashtra at a rented accommodation where they provided training to the selected candidates and even paid them monthly stipends in their bank accounts during the training period.

Police seized more than 20,000 fake railway documents, including application forms, appointment letters, training call letters, character certificates, medical certificates, along with forged seals and other documents from their possession.

The accused gang members led a luxurious life and maintained high-end SUVs. They loaned the fraud money at high interest rates and earned further illegal profits. They operated in Uttar Pradesh also and have two cases registered against them in Jalaun district of the state.

DIG Irshad Wali said that the arrested accused were identified as Sudhir Dohre, the kingpin of the racket and his nephew Rajesh Dohre, both residents of Bhopal. Sudhir was appointed as constable in Sehore police in 1997 and was transferred to GRP, Bhopal. In 2009 he was terminated for his involvement in a similar fraud case. The absconding members of the gang are identified as Santosh Guha, history-sheeter Amit alias Pintu Markandeya, Santosh Halwai, Dilip Kumar — all resident of Bhopal and Manik Mathe, a resident of Mumbai.

DIG Wali said that the gang was busted on the basis of a complaint filed by victim Gopal Singh Thakur, (33), a resident of Krishna Nagar in Bajaria area.

Gopal in his complaint stated that he ran a readymade garment shop in his native town Piparia in Hoshangabad district, while his father worked at the Railway Coach Factory in Bhopal. He said that he came in contact with his father’s colleague Santosh Guha, who introduced him to kingpin Sudhir in 2018. Sudhir lured Gopal into his trap by promising to get him TC job in the Railways on payment of Rs15 lakh.

Gopal told TOI that he fell into the trap and on October 10, 2018, accused Sudhir provided him postal order, railway question booklet and answer-sheet which he filled and returned.

Four days later Sudhir gave him call letter and a roll number form on which he took his thumb impression. A month later Sudhir took the first instalment of Rs5 lakh from Gopal and next month gave him a training letter after taking Rs3 lakh.

Gopal said that in January 2019, Sudhir sent him for training to Bhusawal, where 14 more candidates took training with him. In the meanwhile, Sudhir took Rs4.5 lakh from Gopal’s family in Bhopal. The remaining payment of Rs2.5 lakh was to be paid after joining the job.

Gopal said that he stayed at the training centre in Bhusawal for two months and got stipend in his bank account. Before the training completion, Sudhir asked all the trainees to leave. When he and other candidates were at the railway station, they were detained by police and released later. When Gopal reached Bhopal, he came to know that Sudhir duped two more relatives using the same modus operandi to the tune of Rs5 lakh.

DIG Wali said that preliminary investigations suggest that the gang had contacts with local police in Bhusawal. The volume of candidates duped by the gang is very high and the fraud may run into crores. Investigations are underway and the number of accused may increase.

Koraput: The 105-km stretch of the state highway (SH) 39, which passes through Nabarangpur district, is yet to be declared a national highway (NH) even though a notification in this regard was released two years ago.

According to a notification issued by the ministry of road transport and highways on December 5, 2018, the stretch from Papdahandi to Likima in the district was to be declared NH-130 CD — a part of NH-30 that connects Sitarganj in Uttarakhand with Ibrahimpatnam in Andhra Pradesh.

Sources said the authorities concerned was yet to hand over the road widening work to the NH authorities for its development. The stretch is under the control of the state public works department (PWD).

“Being a tribal belt, the move will boost the economy of the region and expedite development activities. However, it is unfortunate to see that even after two years of issuing a notification, the state government has not taken any step to convert the stretch into an NH,” Nikunja Patnaik, a Nabarangpur resident, said.

As per the notification, NH-130 CD (214 km) will start from Kurud in Chhattisgarh (North) and pass through Likima, Kundei, Hatabharandi, Raighar, Beheda, Umerkote, Dhodra, Dhamanaguda, Dabugaon before connecting Papdahandi (South). Once the stretch is converted in to an NH, work to make it 10 m wide will start.

When contacted, officials of the Nabarangpur PWD division said the notification was yet to be implemented and refused to cite a reason behind the delay.

Superintending engineer of Jeypore PWD circle, Arun Kumar Sahoo, said, “I came across the notification and wrote to the regional officer of the NH department in Bhubaneswar to take over the road.” All required formalities would be completed before handing over the road to the NH authorities, he added.

JAIPUR: The multi-level parking project in C-scheme, Ashok Marg area , which started nearly nine year ago, will be inaugurated on Thursday.

The project, which will accommodate 400 cars, will be opened by urban development and housing (UDH) department minister Shanti Dhariwal. The parking is expected to provide relief to number of office-goers as there is no space in the area.

An official source at the JMC said, construction of the multi-level parking project started about nine years ago on public private and partnership mode. The contractor was given rights to construct a commercial space on government land in exchange.

“The project was embroiled in controversy after the contractor moved an application to raise the height of building (commercial space) from 15 metre to 22 metre. However, objections were raised by the department for the same. The project was delayed for this reason,” sources said.

Parking has been a major issue in the fast-growing Jaipur as the number of registered vehicles increases by 12% annually. “Vehicles parked on roads not only obstruct traffic, lack of parking space also creates a difficulty for the visitors at the major markets.

Ajay Maken

NEW DELHI: Former Union minister Ajay Maken is unlikely to contest the upcoming Delhi assembly election ,which is expected to see several old-timers with some young faces challenging the incumbent AAP and BJP.

Sources said Maken, a two-term MP from New Delhi constituency and a minister in Manmohan Singh’s cabinet, has “indicated” his unwillingness to enter the fray to the central leadership.

Interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi met four leaders — Maken, Jai Prakash Agarwal, Arvinder Singh Lovely and Rajesh Lilothia who contested the last Lok Sabha election — along with former MLA Naseeb Singh at her residence on Monday and asked them to contest.

Sources claimed that while the other four agreed, Maken expressed his “reservations” on contesting. “He clearly told Sonia that he was not keen to contest. While leaving the meeting room, she reconfirmed that Maken will not be contesting this time,” said a source privy to the development. Maken could not be contacted for comments as he was travelling. The former Union minister had contested the last assembly polls from Sadar Bazar assembly segment and lost by over 50,000 votes. He also lost the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls from New Delhi constituency.

The other party leaders who attended the January 13 meeting at Gandhi’s residence have agreed to “follow” the instructions of the Congress president. While Agarwal, who was Congress MP from Chandni Chowk may contest from his traditional seat, Lovely may fight from Gandhi Nagar. Though Lilothia expressed his desire to challenge chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on New Delhi seat, sources said he might contest from Patel Nagar. The central election committee of Congress is likely to meet on Thursday to discuss the names of the candidates.

Governor Kalraj Mishra during the function in the city on Wednesday

JAIPUR: Author and historian Rajmohan Gandhi , who is the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi , said the Father of the Nation was always against the division of India.

While delivering the keynote address on ‘Understanding Gandhi’ on the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on the Founders’ Day of a private hotel group here, he said, “His efforts to prevent the Partition were incomparable to any other. He always tried to spread happiness and eradicate hatred.”

“In this mission, he visited villages in various parts of the country to spread the message of friendship and unity. Gandhi left behind the power of Satyagraha, taught people to think of the poor when in conflict and made people realise that not only should India be free, every Indian should also be free. He taught people to be fearless, brave and educated them about the true meaning of ‘Ahimsa’ (non-violence),” said the former West Bengal governor.

He said there was some truth to the statement that Gandhiji did not devote as much time to his own family. This was perhaps because he adopted all of India as his family. But Gandhiji loved his family and his grandchildren very much.

“As the ‘Father of the Nation’, he considered all children of the country his own and had to sacrifice spending time with his own family. As his family, we also realised that although Gandhi is in our blood, his soul lives in all children of the nation,” he added.

Governor Kalraj Mishra said Gandhi taught us that we are not lesser than anyone else and giving inferiority complex any space in our minds was a crime. He forced the decolonisation of a huge empire through the power of Satyagraha and Ahimsa.

Mishra said, “Satyagraha is not for the weak, it is for the brave . Gandhi has always instilled Swabhlamban (self-reliance) among the youth. This was a combination of Swabhiman (self-respect), Swadeshi (indigenous) and Gram Swaraj.”

Bapu taught us the sins of our society - politics without principles, business without ethics, deeds without character and science without humanity, Mishra said.

BIJNOR: A day after two missing brothers – aged 23 and 16 years – were found murdered, police have detained two men for interrogation on Wednesday.

What initially looked like gun shots were found to be injuries due to repeated stabbing with sharp-edged weapons in the postmortem report.

According to sources, two men — Ankit and his friend Salman — were picked up by police on Wednesday in connection with the murders. One of them is a relative of the girl who had earlier filed a harassment case against one of the brothers. Police said that the accused have confessed to the crime.

City superintendent of police Lakshmi Nivas Mishra said, “We have detained two persons in connection with the double murder case at Baankpur village. The deceased were identified as Shubham and Ashish. The former had two cases against him including one related to harassment.”

“We have detained two persons — Ankit and Salman. They have confessed to the crime. The cause of murder is yet to be ascertained. We suspect that more people are involved. The interrogation is going on as they are changing their statements again and again,” he added.

Animal husbandry minister Lakhan Singh Yadav

BHOPAL: Animal husbandry minister Lakhan Singh Yadav on Wednesday called RSS a “dangerous organization”, triggering protest from BJP.

Responding to questions from mediapersons in Kanhar village of Morena, Yadav said: “The Congress manifesto said RSS activities would be prohibited in government premises. An order in this regard will be issued soon.”

“RSS is a dangerous organization that creates chaos in the country and spreads misinformation,” the minister said, adding: “By attending RSS shakhas , government employees stop working for the government. We are monitoring their activities and will ban government employees from attending RSS shakhas.”

The Congress government had banned RSS activities on government premises in Madhya Pradesh in 1981. The ban was revived in 2000 by then chief minister Digvijaya Singh, and it continued under BJP chief ministers Uma Bharti and Babulal Gaur, before then CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan lifted it in 2006.

Reacting sharply to Yadav’s remarks, BJP said RSS is a patriotic, disciplined and cultural organisation. “Congress has a tendency to oppose RSS for political benefit. Those who do not think good about India are afraid of RSS. But, Congress always gives political patronage to those who talk ill of the country,” said BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal.

Bhubaneswar: With Class X and XII board exams hardly a month away, schools in the city are busy conducting doubt clearing sessions and taking extra classes for students. WhatsApp groups, house visits, mentorship and mock tests are being taken by city schools to ready students for the board examinations.

However, teachers and students feel they don’t get adequate time as the examination has been pre-poned this year. The board examinations are starting from February 15 instead of the usual March first week.

“Though courses have already been completed, revisions, doubt-clearing and practice of sample question papers require more time. If students do not get adequate time for practicing then their confidence level will get affected,” said Prajna Paramita Mishra, a teacher in a city school .

Besides by conducting the practical board examinations in January instead of February has again reduced the preparation time for students which otherwise would have been used for revision classes.

Teachers in DAV Public School, Chandrasekharpur, said apart from doubt clearing sessions they are conducting very similar tests and making them practice as many question banks.

“Apart from CBSE sample papers, our teachers have also prepared question banks for students to practice. The tests are highly beneficial for slow learners. Teachers have been asked to WhatsApp groups and to address doubts of students immediately. Besides, there is zero mark test where scoring will be done in minus and the highest mark is zero,” said Debendra Pati, senior teacher of the school.

Due to shortage of time many schools are also conducting extra classes during Saturdays. “The board examinations have been preponed by almost 15 days but revisions have to be done within the time. Teachers are asking us to come to school on Saturdays and holidays too. There are also model examinations which we have to attend before the board examinations,” said Rakesh Pani, student of Class X.

“We have assigned 10 students under one mentor or teacher, who will look after the doubts and revisions of those students. Besides there are regular practice and mock tests going on for students besides counselling sessions to reduce their stress and boost their confidence level before the examinations,” said Sarat Kar, spokesperson of SAI International School.

KOLHAPUR: The traders from the district protested against the “unethical and unfair business practices” of e-commerce firms Amazon and Flipkart on Wednesday.

They held dharna against the functioning of these companies at Bindu Chowk.

This was the nation-wide protest organised by the Confederation of All India Traders ( CAIT).

Sanjay Shete, president of Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce, the organisation that led the protest in Kolhapur, said, “Central government in January 2019 had passed a rule that had prohibited these companies from granting a discount to only some sellers. These companies followed the rule until the completion of the general elections. But during the festive seasons including Dasara and Diwali, they violated these rules by granting huge discounts to some sellers.”

“Apart from this, these companies have affected the local retail business in cities, towns and villages. It has affected local businesspersons involved in trading of mobile phones, garments, shoes and electronic goods,” he said.

These companies have abused the government’s foreign direct investment (FDI) policy.

“These companies have earned huge profit through record sales during festivals and providing offers but have always claimed that their business is at loss. This is to cheat the government and not pay the tax. Government is losing tax which could have been recovered if the consumers purchased from local retailers,” he said.

“There are more than 2,800 shops rented by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation to various traders for their small and retail businesses. These all are affected directly or indirectly due to these e-commerce companies,” he said.

“There are more than 2.5 lakh small and retail businesses in Kolhapur district that are affected due to these companies. The diversion of consumers to e-commerce sites will again increase their loss which will ultimately slow down the economy,” he said.

Bashir Jhankhra grows fodder in three bighas of the total six bighas land that he possesses.

SAVARKUNDLA (AMRELI): At a time when self-styled gau rakshaks are unleashing fear, a group of Muslim friends in Savarkundla not only set a example of communal amity but also immortalized their friendship with a Hindu by following the tradition of feeding cows on the pious day of Makar Sankranti.

On January 14, Bashir Jhankhra and his friends went around the town and fed nearly 650kg fodder to cows as a homage to his Brahmin friend, Nilesh Mehta, who died of cardiac arrest a fortnight ago.

“Nilesh was like my brother. As he was a Brahmin, the priests who performed his last rites told me that if I wanted to pay tribute to him, ‘gau seva’ (service to the cows) was the best way,” said Bashir who lives in Maninagar locality in the town.

Jhankhra grows fodder in three bighas of the total six bighas land that he possesses. Had he sold the 650kg of grass in the market, he would have easily earned anything around Rs 25,000. But he was not lured by money. Such was his bonding with Nilesh that Jhankhra even refused help from his farm labourers and harvested the entire grass all by himself. He was assisted by his friends – Junaid Jhankhra, Arif Sheikh, Idris Sheikh, Mohammed Hanif and Imtiyaz Pathan – in this activity.

Jhankhra’s farm is located exactly opposed the local municipality office where Nilesh worked as a temporary staffer and that’s how their friendship blossomed.

“I was helped by five of my friends in cutting the 650kg of grass from my farm. And what can be the best occasion but Makar Sankranti to feed the cows in my locality fresh fodder on the day,” said Jhankhara.

Parag Trivedi, vice-president of Amreli District Bramha Samaj, said, “We salute Jhankhara for the commendable way in which he paid tributes to a friend. He has truly produced an example of communal harmony.”

“We joined Bashir in feeding cows as we believe all religions and their cultures should be respected,” added Mehboob Qadri, his friend.

Jhankhra doesn’t support animal slaughter and said that if the cow has been given the status of the mother in Hindu culture, other communities can at least desist from it causing any harm.

206,['16/01/2020'],Nagpur: Read English for accurate drafting said Judge,"This story is from January 16, 2020

<p>Representative image</p><p><br></p>

NAGPUR: The easiest way to perceive new words, correlate them in a grammatically correct structure and expand vocabulary is to religiously read a good English newspaper right from the top left column on the first page to the bottom right column on the last page, said high court judge RV Ghuge, on Wednesday.

He said use of English is inevitable in legal field and lawyers need to make efforts for improving their presentation in this language. Otherwise, they would be restricted to using colloquial parlance, he added.

He was delivering a lecture on ‘Importance of language and pleadings for lawyers’ organized by Study Circle of High Court Bar Association (HCBA) at HC auditorium, Civil Lines. Present at the lecture were HCBA president Gauri Venkatraman, vice-president PB Patil and secretary PS Khubalkar.

Ghuge gave general guidelines pertaining to legal language one must incorporate while writing prayers and synopsis.

“Ultimately, it is about a person’s skill when it comes to drafting prayers. I tried to evolve myself in this area by ensuring that the synopsis does not exceed in length, is crisp for the judges to understand without them having to shuffle through countless pages,” he said.

Speaking about the synopsis, Ghuge said, “It has become an integral aspect as you cannot expect the judge to read several files before he gives his statement. It is humanly impossible. If you prepare the synopsis well, we get the picture of what you wish to say in the matter.”

Other essential steps that Ghuge mentioned were to write short sentences and paragraphs, and knowing when to change paragraphs. He said, “The skill of pleading should be such that the judge does not call the lawyer to understand facts. You should aspire to reach this level of drafting.”

Ghuge said, “The respect shown to the court in the context of conduct is pleasing to witness as far as the Nagpur bar is concerned. The earlier members of the bar have enabled it to mature to such a level. It is on the national map because of CJI Sharad Bobade and Uday Lalit and Bhushan Gavai serving as Supreme Court judges. This stature was not achieved by fluke. It has been earned by Nagpur bar. I hope that Aurangabad bar prospers in the same manner.”

The lecture was organized by Nagpur University at Convocation Hall. Present at the programme were vice-chancellor SP Kane and officiating pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande.

Speaking about Dewey, Stroud said, “He is known as a philosopher of democracy and education in the American context. He might be the best known philosopher over the course of America’s short history. He is an important figure for India because of his writings about democracy and his struggles in America.”

Stroud said Ambedkar was a diligent student of Dewey while studying at Columbia University from 1913 to 1916. He said, “I believe one cannot understand Ambedkar’s pragmatism without talking about Dewey. At the same time, one cannot comprehend the strengths and weaknesses of Dewey’s thoughts without seeing how Ambedkar shaped those ideas uniquely in the Indian context.”

“You can be influenced by people in a way that does not entail you to replicate them. When Dewey died, Ambedkar said that he owed all of his intellectual life to Dewey,” he said.

“Ambedkar’s key concepts in pragmatism like caste as a habit and religion as a means was inculcated through Dewey’s philosophy,” he said.

Stroud said, “My thesis highlighted that Ambedkar’s Buddhism serves as a pragmatic means to develop each individual’s personality. Ambedkar put forth the concept of conversion as a group and individual means for freedom. He addressed how conversion can function as an intelligent means for emancipation.”

On the first day of the lecture series on Monday, Stroud said, “America is dealing with same issues regarding democracy in India, and we need to understand and make others also know how to get along with one another in society.” He was speaking on ‘Teaching of Lord Buddha’.

He spoke about Ambedkar’s concern that “The moment we stop talking and thinking about issues like democracy and what Buddhism taught us about equality and pragmatism, we tend to stop caring about them and they don’t really matter us”.

Stroud said he researched many articles, books and papers to understand Buddhism and how it is connected to American pragmatism and how Dewey influenced Ambedkar.

KOLKATA: Police have busted a gang of conmen, who had travelled around 1,700 km to the city— all the way from Bidar in Karnataka—and targeted jewellery stores in Bowbazar, Entally and Beliaghata. According to the cops, while one of them, Amzad Hussain, was arrested, three others were identified.“The Entally police anti-crime teams were on their rounds around 8.30pm on Tuesday, when they noticed three men roaming around suspiciously in the Sealdah station VIP parking area. As the cops tried to approach them, they began running. Three of them managed to give them a slip but Hussain was intercepted. We found gold chains in his possession and he did not have any satisfactory explanation for it. Suspecting they had been stolen, we cross-checked and found a link,” said Ajoy Prasad, DC (eastern suburban division). The chains were seized and the accused was arrested from the spot, booked under IPC sections 413 (habitually dealing in stolen property) and 414 (assisting in concealment of stolen property).Police said the gang would visit Kolkata for a few weeks, when they would first carry out a recce of jewellery shops and then, strike. The gang would reportedly keep moving from one Kolkata destination to another to evade suspicion. “Snatchers and pickpockets from Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Karnataka have made Kolkata their hunting ground. During their stay, this gang, like the others, had also rented accommodations away from the city to dodge police attention,” said a detective department officer.While Entally police station cops have alerted the OC watch section, detective department officers are likely to question him.The police pointed out that tracking kepmars was difficult as they kept shifting their places of operation. After a couple of operations here, they move to Mumbai or Delhi and may resurface here after about six months, police said, adding that two months ago, a conman from Maharashtra, Gulam Hussain Mallick Irani, who had accosted a man carrying Rs 1 lakh from a Gariahat-based bank branch and tricked him into giving him away Rs 36,000. He was subsequently arrested. “Kepmars are smooth operators. They strike up conversations with their targets and win their confidence by offering help. Some vendors or customers, whom they target, do not always keep a sharp eye out, especially when three to four men operate in tandem. Within seconds, the new-found ‘friends’ melt in the crowd with the stolen items,” an officer said.Read this report in Bengali",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73285742,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-421254,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ktaka-gang-travels-1700km-to-rob-kol-jewellery-stores/articleshow/73281904.cms

KOLHAPUR: The Karveer police are yet to trace the husband responsible for the murder of his pregnant wife in a private hotel in Wadange village on Tuesday.

Police have booked her husband under section 302 of IPC and have launched a search operation to find his whereabouts.

The victim identified as Sarika Vittal Mahanoor was found lying dead at her residence in a private hotel. The couple was married on June 12, 2019, and her husband was working as a cook in the same hotel. The couple was also residing in one of the hotel rooms.

Prashant Amrutkar, deputy superintendent of Karveer the division said, “We have launched a search operation to find out where the accused is absconding. Several teams have been formed that have been deployed to various places where the accused is likely to hide. We are also communicating with the accused’s family members and relatives to find out if he has contacted them since the incident.”

“We have received the post-mortem report from the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) a civil hospital that has confirmed the death of the woman due to strangulation,” he said.

According to police officials, as per the complaint lodged by the victim’s family members since marriage, Sarika’s husband was suspecting her character and used to beat her. He was also a habitual drinker and used to consume liquor regularly. These issues strained their relations and her husband allegedly strangulated her to death.

JAIPUR: The annual board exams is barely a month away but teachers of government schools are engaged in election duties leaving students to their fate. Currently, there are around 50,000 government teachers on poll duty working 24 hours to prepare voters’ lists and attending training camps. This, however, is against the orders of the 2007 Supreme Court that clearly states that government teachers must not be put on election duty during working hours.

Rajasthan government teachers, however, have been hired for poll duty since the last two years for state assembly and urban body elections.

Harendra Singh (name changed), a government teacher appointed for election duty, said it gets tough for the students preparing for board exams. “We have been busy in panchayat elections since September, 2019. In December, schools were closed due to winter vacation and now we are on election duty. There was no time to finish the syllabus. Teachers are always soft target for the government and students’ suffer due to this,” Harendra said.

A senior election commission officer said they have to use the state machinery to conduct elections. “We try to appoint teachers to work after school timings but conducting elections is a huge task and teachers have to be given duties. They are not appointed outside their tehsil or areas they have been working so that they can balance timing with school,” the officer said.

Vipin Sharma, general secretary of the Rajasthan Primary and Secondary Teachers’ Association, said the government always promises not to send teachers for election duty, but in the end nothing is followed.

Kahar with the rescued pigeon

Vadodara: Love for birds led this Barodian to risk own safety after he jumped into the Sursagar lake to save a pigeon injured by a kite string on Uttarayan on Tuesday.

Satish Manga Kahar (43) and his daughter Asha Kahar had gone to Sursagar to witness kite flying festivities in the old city. However, they came to know about a pigeon that had fallen in the pond. Satish did not waste any time and plunged into the water to save the bird.

“I was there with my daughter when the pigeon fell in the pond. I heard policemen were looking for a boat to go into the pond and bring it out. This would be a wastage of precious time during which the bird may drown or die,” said Satish, a resident of Kakasahebno Tekro in Dandiabazaar.

Satish decided to jump into the pond immediately. “Cops asked me if I was able to swim. I told them not to worry about me, but for the bird,” he said. The entire incident was recorded on mobile cameras by people present there. Satish said that later people cheered him for his efforts and even clicked selfies with him and the pigeon.

A member of the Kahar community, Satish is in the business of fishing in Mahi river. “I know swimming and so brought out the pigeon easily,” he said.

BHOPAL: Police busted a major racket of identity thieves and fraudsters who stole identities of people and purchased new vehicles on loan through forged documents. The racket was unearthed after a cop who had lost his wallet received a loan recovery notice for non-payment of EMIs of four two-wheelers.

The constable had lost his wallet and ATM card in 2018. Fraudsters found the wallet and used the constable’s documents to get four two-wheeler vehicles financed from various automobile showrooms in the city.

Hanumanganj police on Tuesday after investigating the constable’s complaint filed in October 2019, registered a case on charges of fraud against four accused and arrested one of them. Police suspects that the accused were involved in several similar frauds and are on the lookout for the three others.

Investigation officer Satyendra Choubey said that complainant constable Santosh Verma, 25, a resident of Teela Kheri village in Khajuri, is presently posted in Police Lines Raisen. He told police that on August 17, 2018, he lost his wallet containing his aadhar card, driving licence, PAN card and photographs along with two ATM cards at a market in Raisen. He had lodged a written complaint in this regard with Kotwali police station in Raisen.

The accused got hold of the wallet and used his documents to finance four two-wheeler vehicles from different automobile showrooms in Bhopal . The first vehicle was financed from an automobile showroom located on Berasia Road merely 10 days after the cop lost his wallet.

Choubey said that Verma was unaware that his documents were being used by fraudsters to finance vehicles. Six months later, in 2019 he came to know about the fraud when he started receiving recovery notices.

Later, on October 10, 2019 he filed a written complaint with Hanumanganj police on which police conducted investigations and registered a case on Tuesday.

Choubey said during investigations police found that accused Rahil Khan and Khalid Khanfound Verma’s documents and used them to open a fake bank account in his name.

Representative image

NAGPUR: Alleging that central government has withdrawn proposed law for protection of medicos, doctors attached to Indian Medical Association (IMA) have decided to “replicate” Mahatma Gandhi’s iconic Dandi March .

Thousands of doctors are expected to participate in the march to be taken out from Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat. This march will start on March 12 — the date on which Mahatma Gandhi had started Dandi March from the same ashram in 1930. However, unlike 384km march by the Mahatma, the doctors’ rally will be a symbolic 4km walk around Sabarmati Ashram.

IMA Maharashtra unit president Dr Avinash Bhondwe told TOI that Union home minister Amit Shah has withdrawn Health Care Service Persons and Health Care Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Bill 2019, which was to be tabled in Parliament.

“The draft of this act was finalized by ministry of health and family welfare. Even the government had agreed that such law was necessary. But, recently, we have been told by home ministry sources that the proposed bill has been withdrawn,” said Dr Bhondwe. “The home ministry said such a law for a particular profession cannot be passed by the Centre,” said the IMA unit president.

“Medical profession and health care services are indeed unique and are comparable to no other professions. Any violence on doctors is indirect violence on patients. The home ministry should reconsider its stand,” he added.

Apart from the central law for prevention of violence, doctors are demanding that only MBBS qualified doctors should be allowed to provide health services in both villages and cities and government should not allow medicos from other streams to head any health centre.

The doctors also have reservations against several provisions in the new National Medical Council (NMC) Act like exit exam after MBBS course and provision that allows non-doctor health care professionals (ANMs, pharmacists etc) to prescribe medicines in some cases.

“IMA Maharashtra has 210 branches, with more than 43,500 members. They will be contacted and sensitized about the March. We also have network of undergraduate medical students and postgraduate students as youth wings of IMA. The students will also be made aware about the injustice. Various NGOs, clubs and associations will also be told about the March,” he said.

Bareilly: A 20-year-old girl fainted and died soon after completing a 2,400 metre run during a physical efficiency test (PET) for Uttar Pradesh armed police’s Pradeshik Armed Constabulary (PAC) entrance exam held at Bareilly’s Nakatiya on Wednesday.

The young girl, who dreamt of working in the police, has been identified as Anshika Singh, daughter of a farmer from Fazalpur village in Baghpat district. And not just Anshika, another girl fell unconscious in the middle of the strenuous running discipline and was rushed to a hospital. Her condition is said to be stable.

PAC commandant Vikas Kumar Vaidhya said that Anshika had qualified for PET but collapsed immediately after she completed the run. In PET, female aspirants need to complete 2.4km run in 14 minutes while male aspirants require 4.8km in 25 minutes.

Anshika had arrived for the entrance test with her father Ramveer Singh who was waiting outside the PAC ground. Anshika was healthy and physically fit and she had easily completed the race, but suddenly fell down on the ground. She was provided medical aid by the doctors present at the ground and sent to the district hospital where she was declared brought dead by the hospital’s emergency medical officer. Her body has been sent for autopsy. Anshika is survived by two younger brothers who study in school. She was preparing for the entrance exam for past two years.

Dr Jitendra Singh, one of the doctors who provided immediate aid to Anshika, told TOI, “Anshika suddenly collapsed and we rushed to take care of her. She did not have any pulse. We provided her CPR [cardiopulmonary resuscitation] and took her to the district hospital. She had died on her way to hospital. Another girl named Shalini Singh, 21, also fainted moments before completing the race. Her condition is stable.”

Anshika’s father told TOI, “My daughter’s dream was to wear a police uniform and she was confident of qualifying the physical test. I was waiting outside the ground when someone told me that my daughter fell ill after qualifying the physical test and she had been taken to the hospital. When I reached the hospital, I was informed that she has passed away.”

A total of 272 aspirants took part in the run on Wednesday where a girl collapsed just after crossing the finishing line, said PAC commandant Bikash Kumar Baidhya. “We had kept two ambulances and deployed trained doctors. The girl was provided medical aid but she couldn’t be saved. She had qualified the physical test and was a bright candidate. We have informed her father about her death,” Baidhya added.

KOTA: Jhalawar district special team seized a cache of arms being smuggled in an ambulance from Madhya Pradesh, to supply for panchayat elections in Baran and arrested four at Teendhar-Mandawar Road under Mandawar police station of Jhalawar district on Wednesday.

District special team (DST) on Wednesday noon seized 11 pistols, three country-made revolvers, four cartridges from an ambulance and arrested four notorious criminals — identified as Fogmal Meena (58), Hansraj Kushwa (41), Kasturi alias KD (26) and Morpal Meena (37) — all residents of Chabda police station of Baran district, SP Jhalawar Rammurti Joshi said.

Acting on a tip-off about a huge stock of arms being smuggled from MP to Hadauti region, the DST, led by inspector Digvijay Singh, carried out operation on Wednesday noon at Teendhar-Mandawar Road where the team stopped the ambulance for checking, but the driver accelerated instead. However, the DST rounded up the ambulance at a distance, he said. The smugglers avoided Indore–Jhalarapatan highway and chose the route that had no police check posts. All the seized arms were sophistically manufactured with fine finishing and four of the nine pistols were marked as ‘Made in USA’, he added.

In interrogation, it was revealed that one of the four arrested smugglers Fogmal alias Foggiya, while in jail at Chabda, came in contact with notorious arms smuggler from Gwalior identified as Mahesh Bhadoriya, who was lodged in Chabda jail, the SP said and added that Bhadoriya shared details of illegal arms network in Hadauti with Foggiya, following which he hatched the conspiracy of smuggling the arms from MP with three others of his town, to supply them in Baran for the demand of arms in panchayat elections.

Bareilly: A Dalit man whose niece was gang-raped and killed by three persons in 2012, and later his son was allegedly killed by the cousins of the accused, has now threatened to sit on a hunger strike at Jantar Mantar in Delhi.

The man was repeatedly thrashed and forced to leave Bareilly district. In 2019, he was allegedly beaten up and his wife was kidnapped and gang-raped by the cousins of the accused to build pressure on the family.

FIR was registered in that case but the accused were not arrested. Instead, police later booked him for raping the wife of one of the accused. The Dalit man was sent to jail but granted bail by court. Now, he and his family are being repeatedly harassed and threatened to reach a compromise in all the cases by the accused, who were all granted bail, as the court trial in gang-rape and murder case is approaching its judgment.

Police are yet to take any action and failed to provide any security to the family which is why he would be sitting on a hunger protest with family in Delhi from January 22.

The man visited the SSP Bareilly office and shared his grievances with senior cops. He told TOI, “My entire family is scared because the accused are repeatedly harassing and threatening us for a compromise. I was assured by the police that the accused will be arrested soon but no action has been taken so far.”

SP (crime) RK Bhartiya said, “The murder case of his niece is pending in court while the gang-rape case registered by his wife is investigated by circle officer Aonla. This case was registered at Bisalpur police station in Pilibhit district where the concerned circle officer had filed a closure report but the case was later transferred to Bareilly. We will look into the status of the investigation and take necessary action. The family can always seek security if they are threatened by the accused.”

The real issue is development.The Seelampur assembly constituency , with a predominantly Muslim electorate, has been a Congress stronghold. Former Congress MLA Chaudhary Mateen Ahmad, who didn’t lose a poll for two decades till 2015, is still a name to reckon with. Ahmad bucked anti-incumbency in the 2013 assembly elections, but couldn’t counter the Aam Aadmi Party juggernaut in 2015, losing to that party’s Mohammad Ishraq Khan by a big margin.

The road in front of my house used to fill up with sewage whenever it rained, but the government increased the road’s height and improved the drainage system. The MLA doesn’t matter, we will vote for Kejriwal.”Aas Mohammad, 68, spoke of what mattered to ‘poor people like us’. He said, “Most families here now pay zero for electricity. The water quality was somewhat bad earlier, but both quality and supply have improved. This is what is important to us. The smallest saving in our monthly expenses means a lot to us.”The constituency has colonies of all sort — unauthorised, regularised and resettlement — plus a sizeable number of slums. Most people TOI talked to said they did have complaints about improper drainage and broken roads but were satisfied overall with progress in their localities.“Choked sewers are an issue in our area and though new pipes are being laid, it will take time,” concurred Jalaluddin, a resident of Jaffrabad. “But the AAP government has done a lot of other work. CCTV cameras have come up, many medicines are now available for free at hospitals and bus travel is free for women.” After some silence, he added, “The most important change in the last five years, however, is that no one asks for a bribe now.”The Muslim electorate is substantial, but there is sizeable Hindu vote in areas like Brahampuri and Maujpur. Naresh Kumar Sharma, a Brahmapuri resident, pointed out their own problems. “Sealing of commercial spaces is a big issue here. Many shop owners and their workers no longer have work. Many small household industries have also been terminated and though unauthorised, these did provide livelihood to many,” Sharma said.He acknowledged that roads had become better and streetlights had been put up. “This is a lower middle class area and what might seem basic facilities in other parts of the city are big boons for us,” he reasoned.The road from Brahmapuri narrows as one approaches Maujpur and vehicle speed dwindles. It doesn’t help that the potholed road is uneven and slushy. The sentiment also changes. “There may have been development in other areas but roads and drainage in Maujpur are in terrible shape,” grumbled Avnish Kumar, 33, who migrated to Maujpur from Haryana’s Kosi a decade ago.Another resident, Vinit Sharma, muttered, “The AAP government has only distributed freebies, but they haven’t come for free. They were paid for by the taxes we pay.” His assertive declaration: “This election, we are going to vote in Modiji’s name.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73289110,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-203200,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/big-divide-which-way-will-the-electorate-go/articleshow/73281949.cms
226,['16/01/2020'],Imam in UP ‘bars’ CAA-backer from offering namaz at mosque,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Representative image

BAREILLY: An elderly man, who had purportedly backed the recently amended Citizenship Act (CAA), alleged that he and his son were barred from offering namaz by the imam of local ‘Chand’ mosque in Siraskheda under Mudhapandey police station limits of Moradabad district . The imam, however, has dismissed the man’s allegations.

Idris Ahmad has now approached the cops in Moradabad with his complaint. Ahmad said after his support for the CAA, the imam has threatened him with dire consequences, if he or his family tried to step into the place of worship. His son, Mohammed Khakan, was also not allowed to enter, alleged Ahmad. The imam claimed that Ahmad had some personal issues with him for which he was being targeted.

Notably, Ahmad reached SSP office on Tuesday evening along with his son and a few friends and demanded action against the imam. In his complaint registered with SSP of Moradabad Amit Pathak, he stated that imam Anees Miyan had been misleading the public on CAA, national population register (NPR) and national register of citizens (NRC). “The imam also instigated locals with his anti-national sermons in the mosque,” Ahmad alleged. SP (city) Amit Kumar Anand said that they were probing the matter.

On Wednesday, the imam made counter allegations, “I have certain differences over theological matters with him. We had an argument once and his son was also present. Upon confronting them, his son started manhandling me.” He also clarified that nobody was stopped from entering the Chand mosque to offer namaz.

Inspector Shakti Singh, the house officer at Mudhapandey police station, said that both complainant and the imam have been asked to pay them a visit on Thursday. “Prima facie, it seems the issue is more about some personal grudge,” Singh added.

Bijnor: A day after two missing brothers – aged 23 and 16 years – were found murdered, police have detained two men for interrogation on Wednesday.

What initially looked like gun shots were found to be injuries due to repeated stabbing with sharp-edged weapons in the postmortem report.

According to sources, two men — Ankit and his friend Salman — were picked up by police on Wednesday in connection with the murders. One of them is a relative of the girl who had earlier filed a harassment case against one of the brothers. Police said that the accused have confessed to the crime.

City superintendent of police Lakshmi Nivas Mishra said, “We have detained two persons in connection with the double murder case at Baankpur village. The deceased were identified as Shubham and Ashish. The former had two cases against him including one related to harassment.”

“We have detained two persons — Ankit and Salman. They have confessed to the crime. The cause of murder is yet to be ascertained. We suspect that more people are involved. The interrogation is going on as they are changing their statements again and again,” he added.

Panaji: CM Pramod Sawant urged teachers to organise science, technology and research-oriented field trips for students, so children get early exposure and are able to develop an interest in science. He was speaking at the inaugural of the 5th edition of SCI-FFI ( Science Film Festival of India) 2020 organised by Vidnyan Parishad, Goa on Wednesday.

Sawant lauded the work by Vidnyan Parishad, Goa, a unit of Vigyan Bharati, and said science film festival was the need of the hour.

“Science films are a very easy and effective medium to further the cause of science as it has the largest potential to attract students to science with the cinematic experience, visual effects and voice modulation that is fantastical and can feel real in the movie theatre,” he said.

Vice-chairman of Entertainment Society of Goa Subhash Phal Desai, chairman of Dempo Charitable Trust Shrinivas Dempo, director SRFTI (Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute Kolkata) Dr. Debamitra Mitra, director IIRS (Indian Institute of Remote Sensing) Prakash Chauhan, and National Organising Secretary, Vigyan Bharati, Jayantrao Sahasrabudhe were also present.

229,['16/01/2020'],Corporators threaten to protest over inadequate water supply,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Kolhapur: Corporators from Rajarampuri and Shahupuri on Wednesday threatened to hit the streets with the locals if the civic body fails to resolve the issue of inadequate water supply .

During the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation’s (KMC) standing committee meeting on Wednesday, the corporators claimed that in Rajarampuri water is being supplied at low pressure for the last 15 days and Shahupuri has got no water for the last five days.

The corporators claimed the locals are angry and despite repeated complaints the civic officials are not doing anything.

Sandip Kawale, corporator from Rajarampuri, said, “Every time we ask the civic officials about the inadequate supply, they ask us to wait for some day. People are angry as they are not getting adequate water even for drinking. We are going to hold protests if the water supply situation does not improve in the next couple of days.”

An official from the water supply department attending the meeting said water level of Panchaganga river has declined and the civic administration has written to the water resources department (WRD) to release the water from the dams.

“The water level has come down. Letters have been written to the WRD to release water. Inadequate pumping of the water is taking place at Shinganapur and Puikhadi. The work of repairing the barrage at Shinganapur pumping station will start soon for which we have to stop water supply for at least two to three days,” the official said.

The corporators, however, claimed that a couple of weeks ago the officials had maintained that the WRD has started the release of the water.

Chairman of the committee Sharangdhar Deshmukh said, “The officials should take an appointment and meet the WRD officials on Monday. Some of us will also remain present and request them to release water. Work of repairs of the barrage and thereby planning for water cuts should not be done before the release of water from the dams.”

The water department official also claimed that the motors at Shinganapur and Aptenagar pumping stations have become old and need to be replaced. The corporators reminded the official that Rs 22 lakh have been allocated in the budget and asked the official to use the same for procuring new motors.

Kolkata: Dr. Oetker, the Euro 7-billion German conglomerate, is looking at Rs 500crore revenue from its Indian business in the next two years. The MNC which has global presence in food, beer, sparkling wine, banking, entered India in 2008 with spreads and pleasure foods. Currently, the India business of the company is at Rs 300 crore. It is present in peanut butter, continental sauces and other spreads.

Oliver Mirza, managing director & CEO of the company, said that mayonnaise is the biggest and top-growing segment for Oetaker and contributes over 50% of its revenue in India. Peanut butter has a share of 20%-25% followed by other products.

Mirza who was here to launch a variant of peanut butter pointed out that in 2008 when, the German MNC had entered India, mayonnaise was a Rs 8crore market compared to Rs 600 crore for Ketchup. “But, now mayonnaise has become Rs 300crore market while ketchup is now Rs 1,200 crore segment, so the growth of mayonnaise was much more,” added the Oetker MD.

He claimed that the company is the market leader in mayonnaise with over 60% marketshare, while in peanut butter, it has a marketshare of 20%. “These are two biggest categories in new age spreads,” he added. Incidentally Sundrop is another major player in the peanut butter segment.

Commenting on Kolkata market, he added that Kolkata is its 8th largest market globally and could become 6th largest in future.

232,['16/01/2020'],KMC to appoint expert to monitor solid waste processing plants,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation ( KMC ) is going to appoint an independent engineer to operate the solid waste processing plants and install an online system for continuous monitoring of biomedical waste processing unit.

The KMC is operating several solid waste processing plants and according to a health department official, several technical glitches are being reported now. “The workers at these units and the administration lack the expertise to resolve the glitches,” he said.

Dilip Patil, chief health officer of the KMC, said, “We felt the need of an expertise to keep a close watch on the processing units. We are operating processing plant, slurry units and bio-gas units at several locations and require expertise of an engineer who will help us keep a watch on the amount of waste brought to the processing plant, the quality of the processing and the end product.”

He added, “We are also planning to sell the by-products generated from the waste processing plant. Marketing of the by-products will be carried out with the help of the engineer and selling the by-products will help the KMC earn revenue.”

The KMC is planning to set up bio-gas units at several locations in the city as part of its decentralisation of the waste processing. The engineer will have to ensure proper running and check the wear and tear of the machineries in the plant. “Regular watch and speedy addressing of technical issues will reduce the time and inconvenience to the citizens,” Patil said.

Since the last two years, the civic body is operating the biomedical waste processing plant that is located at Kasba Bawda. The health department has also proposed to upgrade the machineries for processing of the waste generated in hospitals.

At present the waste is subjected to various processing methods such as autoclaving, incineration, disinfection and shredding. “We are going to install online system to monitor each of the process, the amount of green gasses emitted and keep tab on the amount of biomedical waste processed in the plant. The machineries and other systems too will be upgraded soon,” said Patil.

A section of students is learnt to be not very keen on continuing the protests (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: The leaders of the protests against the hostel fee hike in Jawaharlal Nehru University complained that the increase was decided without consulting the stakeholders. Now they are being charged with the same offence by four independent councillors. This possible divide among the agitationists seemed to be confirmed on Wednesday when the JNU Students’ Union council meeting was postponed.

The letter of dissent was written by councillors Farhat Salim of the Centre for Law and Governance , Himadree Sonowal and Vishnu Prasad K of the School of International Studies and Afreen Fatima of the School of Language and Literature.

“We, the four undersigned councillors, have been forced to take out this pamphlet in deep anguish against the JNUSU following the press meet where they gave the call for ‘original registration’ (with just the registration fee). We are not members of the Left Unity alliance and we want to explicitly state how undemocratically the union has pushed through this mandate without any consultation with us or with the school faculty committee of various centres. The unorganised way with which information is being disseminated presently undermines the trust that students have put in their elected representatives,” the letter said.

The quartet questioned the union about its January 11 stand that students should only pay the semester fee of Rs 108 and Rs 120. “… by paying this fee a day scholar is put in sharp contrast with the campus residents who have to undergo a two-fold process of hostel clearance as well as semester fee payment. Non-resident scholars in a single click can now have themselves registered if they heed the JNUSU’s green light. In most hostels the total dues are inclusive of increased fees (hiked room rent) where distinguishing the registration fees becomes difficult. It goes without saying that a considerable section of students has registered solely out of the sheer confusion manufactured by the union’s message. Does a unilateral step as this one not affect the solidarity which this moment in our sustained movement against fee-hike requires?” the statement said.

It added, “… there remains no clarity on reconvening the IHA (Inter-Hall Administration) meeting at the core of the issue, the proposed 10% annual hike on room rent, demands for rescheduling of end semester assessments and facilitating a buffer period before examinations.”

Speaking to TOI, Salim elaborated, “When JNUSU said it would ask students to register, they did it without going through a democratic process. Many students said yesterday that though JNUSU seemed keen on ending the struggle, they were ready to continue. There is also no clarity for those who are yet to register, while many facing proctorial inquiry are scared.” A call has been given for a sit-in by those facing such inquiries on Thursday.

A senior NSUI leader on the campus added that most student organisations, specifically the leftist ones, did not wish to continue the protests “though the students want to go on till the hike is fully rolled back”.

In response, JNU Students’ Union vice-president Saket Moon said, “All decisions will be taken after listening to the students and GBMs. We will call a council meeting to decide on these issues.” Regarding the uncertainty of students who haven’t yet registered, he said, “Students can still register in the middle of the semester.”

As for the pending proctorial action, Moon assured, “We will ensure the inquiries are dropped and that no registration will take place until those who have been named for questioning have their names dropped. The Union HRD ministry has asked the university administration not to take punitive action against protesters.”

KOLKATA: If you are asked to provide your thumb impression to buy a mobile SIM card, be careful lest you fall victim to identity theft. In, perhaps, the first such case in Kolkata, a 58-year-old homemaker from Bhowanipore was shocked when she discovered that her biometric data had been misused to obtain a SIM card and commit crimes in Rajasthan.The victim, mother of a college student from Chakraberia Road, lodged complaints with both Bhowanipore police and the cyber cell. She has now moved court, asking why the mobile service provider should not be held guilty for failing to protect her identity. A local court has now directed the Kolkata Police’s cyber cell to conduct a thorough probe, said her advocate Bivas Chatterjee.“Frauds using data and forms provided by customers are common. But biometric data theft is a sign that the data can be used for many other illegal activities,” said Chatterjee. Police refused to share details of the case saying it was an extremely sensitive case.The woman said that on January 2, officers from Civil Lines police station in Ajmer, Rajasthan, knocked on her door. An officer from Bhowanipore police station, who was with the team, informed her that a mobile phone had been used to carry out cheating and forgery and that the number was registered in her name. “On my repeated requests for further information, the Rajasthan cops showed me a copy of the forged prepaid customer application form. When they left, I lodged two complaints with the police the same day,” the woman stated in her application to the court.The woman recalled that on February 22, 2019, she had gone to a store on Sarat Bose Road to apply for a new SIM card. “The agent there asked me to provide KYC documents. He also asked me to give my register my fingerprint on a biometric scanner for verification prior to activating the new SIM card.“The agent — after taking a photocopy of my Aadhaar card — asked me to provide my fingerprints again, claiming that the first attempt was unsuccessful as the thumb impression was unclear. The gap between taking the first and last thumb expression was at least 10 minutes. Not suspecting anything, I agreed. I believe that is when the manipulation took place,” the woman stated in her petition. Investigators are likely to question the agent soon.An officer said that her identity had been recorded twice on purpose. Her identity was compromised at the source, he said.

“After Kumar got his finger inked, he took the ballot paper. And while he was casting his vote, he took the selfie,” said an official on poll duty. A case has been registered against Kumar at Jangaon police station for violating secrecy. Telangana State Election Commission officials had already instructed voters not to carry mobile phones inside the polling booths.

Representative image

PANAJI: Work to fit solar panels atop all 33 government and aided colleges in the state will begin with Government College, Borda. The Goa Energy Development Agency (GEDA) has already carried out a feasibility report and has found the college buildings suitable for the fitment of solar panels.

First government colleges will be taken up for the work and then aided colleges, officials of the directorate of higher education (DHE) said.

Similarly, solar panels will also be installed at Goa University.

The idea is for institutes of higher education to set an example and create awareness among students and faculty about the process by switching over to a renewable source of energy.

As the government provides subsidy to solar power generators and users, it will reduce electricity costs for the institutes. The initiative will also help the state as it will reduce dependency on state power supply network.

The move is especially important as institutes of higher education are moving towards smart classrooms where gadgets are used in the teaching process, increasing electricity usage.

“Any excess solar power will be sold to the local state grid,” said a DHE official.

The scheme, known as ‘sourya sangath’ or friendship with the sun, will be implemented from the current academic year 2019-20 and will be carried out in a phased manner, officials said.

Eastern Command GOC-in-C Lt Gen Anil Chauhan at Fort William on Wednesday

KOLKATA: You may soon get to tour the Army’s Eastern Command headquarters at Fort William . On Wednesday, on the occasion of Army Day, Eastern Command GOC-in-C Lt Gen Anil Chauhan flagged off such a tour for select invitees. He said the tour will be opened to the general public soon.

An official said the first tour for the general public is likely to be conducted on February 2. The modalities are now being worked out and people will soon be informed from where they can collect passes for the tour.

“During the Vijay Diwas celebrations of 2019, we had opened up the war memorial — ‘Vijay Smarak’ — to Kolkatans who wanted to pay homage to martyrs of the Indian Army . We now intend to open up selected areas of Fort William to people interested in the history of the city. The history of Kolkata and Fort William are almost synonymous. This will be done through an organized, guided historical walk on Sundays,” Lt Gen Chauhan said after laying a wreath at Vijay Smarak to pay homage to martyrs.

The tour will be organized by an agency. Charges for refreshments that will be served midway through the tour are yet to be fixed. However, sources said that only a limited number of people will be allowed per tour to prevent rush and confusion.

“The new Fort William was constructed nearly 250 years ago after the old structure near the present GPO was sacked by Nawab Siraj ud-Daula’s troops. Unfortunately, history about this fort is sketchy, but we have tried to collate details from some books in our library and various other sources,” an official said.

Areas that will be made accessible to visitors include the famous Dalhousie Barracks that can house nearly 1,000 troops along with their equipment. People can also visit a cell where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was supposedly imprisoned for three days.

They would be able to get close to the 100-foot-high Ball Tower which was originally used for semaphore signalling to passing ships on the Hooghly. Later, a large ball was placed on top to mark time for the ships. The ball would be raised at 12.55pm every day and lowered at 1pm for ships to mark the time.

Visitors will also be taken to the magnificent Kitchener House, the official residence of Herbert Kitchener, who became commander-in-chief of India in 1902. The building was later used to house Lt Gen AAK Niazi of the Pakistan Army after his surrender in Bangladesh on December 16, 1971. There will also be a visit to the Fort William museum that has several interesting displays.

The decision over blacklisting the agency appointed to install LED streetlights will be taken in the Kolhapur ... Read More

KOLHAPUR: The decision over blacklisting the agency appointed to install LED streetlights will be taken in the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation ’s meeting of general body on January 22.

The standing committee of the KMC has recommended blacklisting of the agency. The earlier government had made it mandatory for the civic administration to get into an agreement with the agency to install 22,874 LED bulbs replacing the sodium vapour lamps.

The agency has appointed around 18 months ago. The agency claims that it has completed the task; however, the corporators are not satisfied with the work done and want the agency to be blacklisted .

A senior corporator of KMC, requesting anonymity, said, “In the standing committee, we had taken the decision about the wattages of the bulb to be installed on the poles. The more the road width and distance between the poles, more would be the wattage of the bulbs.”

“However, when we commute on the roads at night, black spots are created on the roads because of the installation of bulbs with less wattage. The black spots are one of the reasons for the accidents. We want action to be taken against the agency for not abiding with the agreement and neglecting the suggestions of the corporators,” the corporator said.

The agency is expected to maintain the LED lights for next seven years. The agency has claimed that the move will help bring down the electricity bills of the KMC.

The corporators had claimed that at the end of seven years, the KMC will end up paying more to the agency that the amount the KMC will spend on its own to operate the street lights. The deadline for the installing the LED lights has ended on December 31.

In the standing committee meeting held on December 12, the corporators had demanded blacklisting. The corporators even claimed that the LED bulbs do not operate properly and they are not replaced even after registering the complaint with the agency.

A senior official of KMC requesting anonymity said, “The GB ’s decision will be referred to the state government’s urban development department. The state government had signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the agency and it had asked all the urban local bodies to sign up the agency to install the LED lights in their jurisdiction. If the decision is taken for KMC, it may have ramifications for all other civic bodies that had signed up with agency”

KOLHAPUR: Shopowners from Mirajkar Tickti obstructed the civic body’s action of removing the illegal hoardings .

A couple of days ago, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) had instructed the shopowners to remove the illegal hoardings on their own. However, very few shopowners responded to the appeal. The KMC then decided to remove the hoardings and fine the shop owners as per the provisions in the Defacement of the Public Property Act. Shop owners can be fined up to Rs 5,000 and they may have police complaints lodged against them too.

A senior official of the estate department, requesting anonymity, said, “We do not allow the hoardings at locations that can obstruct vision of the public or damage public property. Our team went to Mirajkar Tickti to remove the hoardings. But some shopowners obstructed our staff and vehicles. We had police security and warned the shopowners that they will be detained. We had planned to remove illegal hoardings from other places too, however, the obstruction at the Mirajkar Tickti led to delays.”

The shopowners claimed that they had sought some time to remove the hoardings. One of them said the KMC staff damaged his shop while removing the hoarding, which was the major reason for the shopowner’s opposition. The official, however, said the notices were issued at least twice before initiating the action.

The official claimed that they will carry out the action at full force from Monday onwards.

PM Narendra Modi

NEW DELHI: The IMA’s statement demanding clarification from the Prime Minister over his alleged statement that top pharmaceutical companies bribed doctors with women drew a sharp retort from Delhi Medical Association (DMA) on Wednesday.

The office bearers of DMA said they strongly condemned the statement issued by Indian Medical Association criticising the PM as the very basis of the statement was wrong.

“Association of Pharmaceutical Companies has clarified that no such discussion took place at all in the meeting that was convened by the PM on January 1,” Dr Girish Tyagi, president of DMA, said even as others spoke about the misuse of the apex body of doctors by some of its officers for their partisan purpose.

“It is very deplorable that a few IMA office bearers for their political compulsions are carrying out a defamatory campaign against our Hon’ble PM which is against the national interest,” said Dr Harish Gupta, member of National Medical Council and a former president of DMA.

Gupta said PM Narendra Modi had discussed with top people in the healthcare industry about steps needed to take Indian healthcare to a new level in the coming years to benefit the citizens.

IMA had said if the government had details of the companies involved in supplying women to doctors, why it chose to invite them for a meeting in PMO rather than initiate criminal proceedings. The statement, which stood out because of its tough tone, went on to dub Ayushman Bharat, the Centre’s flagship health project, as a non-starter that is confined to government hospitals where treatment is in any case free.

But DMA said, “We applaud the efforts of our PM in reducing prices of drugs, stents, implants, opening Jan Aushadhi Kendras and bringing Ayushmaan Bharat for the welfare of our nation.”

Some members also pointed out how IMA had been issuing statements without due diligence. “IMA had issued a statement condemning the attack on doctors and nurses who went to attend to the injured students at JNU. They had demanded the home ministry to ensure security in such cases. Later, none of the medical professionals levelling such allegations was found to be working in any official capacity,” Dr Tyagi said.

Rampur: Similar to several women-led anti-CAA protests across the country, around 200 Muslim women of UP’s Rampur have now assembled at the city’s historical Jama Masjid to protest against the local police and administrative officials.

The women have remained at the protest venue for over 48 hours. They are raising their voices against the alleged police atrocities and demanding an immediate release of their family members and the “innocent protesters” of the anti-CAA violence on December 21. The women protesters had also taken up the issue with the local imam and other ulemas.

Rampur district magistrate Aunjaneya Kumar Singh (DM) told TOI on Wednesday, “A protest is going on inside the Jama Masjid. The people are still being instigated by those who were behind the December 21 violence. We have collected enough materials as well as scientific evidence.”

“When we had asked the Jama Masjid committee to send us a list of the innocent protesters, they had actually sent names of all those accused persons against whom we have evidence. The people were all involved in the crime. So, this makes the task of investigating officer difficult, especially to initiate the process under section 169 CrPC,” added the DM.

The DM further said, “I am working around the clock with the police and other administrative officials so that the innocent people can be released from jail.”

On registering section 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) against more than 2,000 protesters when the postmortem report of deceased’s Faiz Khan, an alleged protester, revealed that he died due to gunshot injury, the DM said, “We have found evidence against some of the offenders who were involved in Faiz Khan’s death. We have instructed police officials that murder charges should not be slapped against any innocent people. They should be granted bail. People should not be charged without any proof.”

Rampur Jama Masjid committee secretary Mukarram Inayti said, “The police and the administrative officials had assured us that those who were found to be innocent during the probe will be released under section 169 CrPC after the application of release is produced by investigating officer.”

He added that the matter related to the protesters’ release is still pending.

One of the protesters, Soni, said, “My 20-year-old brother Rahil was arrested and sent to jail illegally by the police.”

Social activist Faisal Khan Lala said, “A list of 13 people who were booked and sent to jail had been given to SP Rampur Santosh Kumar Mishra and he had assured that innocents will be released.”

More than 60% students have registered despite a boycott call by JNU Students’ Union. The administration claimed that classes had also started and the centres had uploaded their time tables. However, students of social science and language schools boycotted the classes.

To register for the current session, students have to clear the mess dues of the previous semester, library dues and pay the room rent for the next six months. They then have to pay the academic registration fees. A folio is generated and the students have to get it signed by the chairperson of the centre and dean and submit it.

There was confusion among students regarding registration as JNUSU had at first asked them to boycott it, but on January 11 told them to just register and pay the academic fees. However, on January 12, the union said the boycott was on as a few students were under academic suspension.

“In most hostels, the total dues are inclusive of the hiked room rent. Because of this, distinguishing between the different charges in the registration fees becomes difficult. A considerable section of students registered solely because of the sheer confusion,” a dissent note by councillors stated.

258,['16/01/2020'],Tourists will curse Goa if we impose steep MV fine: Mauvin,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Panaji: A day after Goa transport minister Mauvin Godinho said the state government would not be able to reduce fines under the amended Motor Vehicles Act, he expressed fears that the steep fines would damage the state's already-fragile tourism sector.

The minister said that with Goa receiving as many as 75 lakh tourists a year, imposition of fines on tourists could hurt Goa’s image as a tourist-friendly destination. “If we fine them, they will curse Goa and they will not want to come again,” Godinho said. “Yes, they should follow the rules, but it has to be reasonable, and that is something I will try to convince the Centre about,” he said.

This isn't the first time Godinho has spoken about reducing the fines. In September, he said the government would reduce the fines under the Act as the government “didn't want to trouble our people”.

On Thursday, Godinho will head to New Delhi for a meeting of transport ministers, where he said he would ask the Centre if Goa could relax some of the fines.

“We will see if we, in tandem with other transport ministers, can ask the Union transport minister to relax some fines if necessary,” he said.

The 18th road safety council meeting and 39th transport development council meeting will see transport ministers of all states meet Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari to discuss improvement in the nation’s transport network.

Godinho said he had already held informal consultations with transport ministers of other states, particularly Gujarat and Maharashtra, who also expressed concern over the heavy fines being imposed on violators.

“I met transport ministers of Gujarat and Maharashtra and they all said that it is very harsh to implement, and that it has to be done gradually,” he said.

Godinho said that based on the Centre’s response, the Goa government would take a call on implementing the new MV Act . The minister said that he would inform the Centre why Goa chose not to implement the amended act with its steeper fines.

“After the meeting, at the next cabinet meeting, we will take a call on it,” Godinho said.

“Central laws cannot be circumvented. I took it on my personal self, which may not be 100% correct, but we had very bad roads, so bowing to public sentiment, we kept it on hold. I will tell the Centre that we have not implemented it, but that we are implementing it now, and also ask them if they will give us any leeway to reduce the fines.”

Satej Patil

KOLHAPUR: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray finally solved the issue of guardian minister for Kolhapur district by appointing Congress’s Satej Patil to the post.

Patil was earlier appointed as Bhandara district guardian minister against the wishes of Congress leaders. Vishwajeet Kadam of Sangli district will be the new guardian minister of Bhandara district. Maharashtra government issued a resolution to this effect on Wednesday evening.

Patil’s appointment has brought much cheer to the Congress unit of Kolhapur. His appointment to Bhandara district had surprised supporters. Kadam was the only Congress minister in Thackeray ministry, who was not given the responsibility of district guardianship.

The latest government resolution says it was making some minor changes in the January 8 order by which Patil was appointed as Bhandara district guardian minister. As per earlier order, Balasaheb Thorat was appointed as Kolhapur guardian minister while Patil was given the responsibility of Bhandara district.

Thorat, who is also holding the post of state Congress chief and is the revenue minister, expressed his inability to take the responsibility. Thorat has maintained that he was over burdened and would like to give opportunity to some other minister. Thorat had even expressed surprise over his appointment as he had communicated his decision to Thackeray.

Patil supporters were upset with the developments for two reasons. Firstly, he was not promoted as full cabinet minister and secondly , he was not given the responsibility of his home district.

Kolhapur also witnessed some political drama between NCP leader Hasan Mushrif and Patil. Both were claimants for the post and their supporters were indulged in verbal duals over the issue. Mushrif, however, continues to be in-charge of Ahmednagar district. Congress and NCP had strained relations over the issue but post went with the former as Congress has more number of MLAs in the district.

A glass gate is seen vandalized inside the JNU campus (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Special Investigation Team ( SIT ) of Delhi Police on Wednesday asked Jawaharlal Nehru University student Dolan Samanta and alumnus Chunchun Kumar to join the probe into the clashes.

While Kumar did not join the probe on Wednesday, Samanta was quizzed for an hour. Both of them might again be called for questioning, as their claims are to be verified, police sources said.

Samanta, who was seen pointing a finger at someone inside the Periyar hostel, was asked why she had entered the hostel premises with her face covered and the conversation she was having with the person she was pointing her finger at, they added.

Kumar, who was allegedly seen pelting stones, will be questioned about the reason of their presence during the clash at the Periyar hostel, the sources said. He would be quizzed on how he had entered the campus and whether he was invited by someone, they added.

The entry logs at the gates are being scanned to find out the reference Chunchun had provided while entering the varsity. The person would also be asked to join the probe.

So far, police have questioned five students— Sucheta Talukdar, Priya Ranjan, Jawaharlal Nehru University Students ’ Union president Aishe Ghosh , Pankaj Mishra and Vhaskar Vijay Mech in connection with the clashes. Notices have been sent to others asking them to join the probe as well.

Meanwhile, a cyber and forensic team visited the university premises and tried to retrieve the recordings of the CCTV footage that was saved on the server which went offline on January 4.

The entire CCTV system at the university premises was affected due to the damaged server. “Once the server is shut down, it has to be completely reset after being switched on. Due to this, the data stored in it is likely to be affected. However, the cops are probing whether an automatic backup had been created,” said a senior police officer.

Nashik: Dengue cases in the city have come down for the first time in the last three months.

In the first two weeks of January this year, a total of 26 people tested positive for dengue. In the last three months, around 60-65 dengue positive cases were reported per week from hospitals in the city.

Last year, as many as 1,125 dengue cases were reported in the city and two people lost their lives to this disease. A Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) official said that dengue cases have started to come down as rainfall has stopped and there has been no waterlogging in any part of the city.

“Moreover, during winter season, dengue cases are bound to go down,” he said. The city recorded 33% rise in dengue positive cases in 2019 as compared to the previous year (2018). However, number of people falling victim to this disease came down in 2019.

In 2018, as many as 844 dengue positive cases were recorded in the jurisdiction of NMC with three deaths. In 2017, the city had registered 949 people testing positive for dengue with no deaths.

A total of 68 and 82 dengue positive cases were reported in the first and second week of December 2019, respectively. Later, the total number of cases registered in the whole month went up to 253.

Last year, there were only 12 dengue positive cases between January 1 and June 30, but there was sudden outbreak from July onwards. The city had recorded 48 dengue positive cases in July and the number rose to 165 in August. In September and October, the number of positive cases was recorded at 117 and 207, respectively. The cases, however, spiked to 322 in November.

“Continuous rainfall with gaps between July and October were the major reason for rise in dengue positive cases. Such weather is favourable for creation of mosquito breeding spots,” the civic official said.

“Usually, winter begins from November, but it was not the case this time around. This had led to rise in dengue positive cases. We have already increased spraying and fogging activities across the city. We are also checking whether the contractor deployed for the work is doing the job properly and regularly,” he added.

Bhosale had on Tuesday condemned the publication of a book authored by BJP member Jay Bhagwan Goyal calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a modern day Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. He said political parties were using the Maratha king’s name for gains.

Bhosale, without naming Pawar, who is often referred to as “Janata Raja” (a wise and aware king) in political circles, said Shivaji Maharaj is the only one who can be called “Janata Raja”. The former Satara MP, who had switched over to the BJP from the NCP, said he felt dejected about the release of the controversial book.

Addressing a function in Satara, where Bhosale recently lost the Lok Sabha by-poll to NCP, Pawar reiterated that Saint Ramdas was never a ‘guru’ of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. “Anybody, who has studied Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj honestly, will come to know that real title of Shivaji Maharaj was Chhatrapati,” he said.

Pawar added that Shivaji Maharaj was described as Janata Raja was Saint Ramdas, who was never a guru of the Maratha king. Pawar said Jijamata was the real guru of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

Pawar said that a few people, who had pen in their hands, wrote such history.

PATNA: In a first-of-its-kind case since prohibition was imposed in the state, two excise officials have been arrested for links with liquor smugglers in Saharsa.

Excise inspector Mohammad Faiyyaz Ahmed and assistant sub-inspector Virendra Pathak posted in Saharsa were arrested on Wednesday, while their district superintendent Mohammad Ashraf Jamal is absconding.

“The inspector and ASI were called at the police station for interrogation after which they were arrested. But the superintendent did not turn up. He will be arrested soon,” Saharsa SP Rakesh Kumar said.

The case relates to a seizure of 2,000 litres smuggled liquor from a truck in Saharsa town on October 12 last year in which the trio reportedly failed to follow procedure while producing accused in court in their bid to shield the culprits.

“An arrested accused Vibhishan Mehta was produced in court after a delay of 72 hours while production must take place within 24 hours,” the SP said.

“The judge was so furious that he refused to forward Mehta to judicial custody and instead ordered the ASI Pathaka, who was the investigating officer in the case, to explain the accused’s illegal detention,” the SP said.

“The list of seized items got prepared at 1.15am on October 13, within two hours of raid. The excise officers had entire day on October 13 to submit the FIR copy before court along with producing the accused. But nothing was done till October 15. The IO turned up in court with the accused on December 16,” the SP added.

Kumar said during an internal inquiry, it also came to light that the excise officers had held a press conference on October 13 and had taken names of three accused for their involvement in the case but none were named in the FIR.

“In addition, seized truck’s registration number mentioned in FIR did not match with the actual vehicle,” he said.

All these irregularities were probed by a team from IG (Prohibition) office. “Later another inquiry was conducted by Saharsa ASP and SDPO.

Bareilly: After seven Congress members were on Tuesday booked under IPC section 307 (attempt to murder) for allegedly clashing with BJP functionaries during the bypoll for Ward 37 of Moradabad Municipal Corporation (MMC), police on Wednesday registered a counter FIR under the same section against several BJP members based on a complaint lodged by Congress functionaries.

On Tuesday, functionaries of both parties scuffled, severely injuring one member each of both the parties at a polling station under Majhola police station. BJP’s Rahul and Congress’s Anmol were admitted to the district hospital with severe injuries. They were later referred to a medical higher facility.

Majhola SHO inspector Rakesh Kumar said, “On Tuesday, an FIR was lodged against seven Congress members, including the party district head and its candidate. However, a counter FIR was registered against BJP members under the same section on Wednesday.”

The position of Ward 37 councillor has been lying vacant since the death of Nannu Singh Saini who passed away around three months ago. Saini’s son Deepak is the BJP candidate from the ward, while the Congress has fielded Surendra Kumar.

Congress district head Vinod Gumber alleged the BJP of deliberately creating a dispute during the polling. “After getting information about the scuffle, we thronged the polling booth and requested BJP functionaries to maintain peace. But, instead of maintaining peace, they started thrashing Congress supporters. It was a pre-planned move to create a dispute.”

Panaji: The state directorate of health services (DHS) is expected to introduce a new vaccine—pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)—in the state in April . On Monday, the DHS signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with United Nations Children’s Fund ( Unicef ) for procurement of PCV .

A DHS official said the orders have been placed for procuring the vaccine and payment has also been made.

“With the introduction of PCV, the state will complete covering 12 vaccine-preventable diseases under the universal immunization program (UIP). It will be administered in three doses,” she said, adding that shipments are expected to arrive in a month or two.

The cost to the government for procuring vaccines will be Rs 1.2 crore. This has been in line with the Union ministry of health and family welfare’s request to facilitate the procurement of PCV for Goa at the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) price.

Unicef officials will arrive in Goa to examine the cold storage facility for the vaccines. The new vaccine however, will be released for use only after it has been tested. “Testing will be carried out by Unicef itself,” she said.

The DHS official added that they have appropriate storage facility and with regards to storage of other vaccines too, proper precautions are taken. Temperature monitoring is done to optimize vaccine potency and spoiled ones are discarded.

The PCV has already been introduced in some northern states with a high mortality rate. “The Goa government has taken the initiative to introduce PCV on its own and will pay from its pocket,” she said. In December, the cabinet gave its nod to singing the MoU with Unicef.

VASCO: A former footballer from Kerala along with his associate was arrested by the Vasco police for running a prostitution racket at a spa-cum-massage parlour in the port town on Tuesday.

Nidhinlal, a goalkeeper who has played for leading I-League clubs in the country including Mumbai FC, Shillong Lajong FC, Minerva Punjab FC and even Indian Super League ( ISL ) champions Chennaiyin FC, was nabbed by the Vasco police along with Shyni Joseph.

The raid was conducted after police received information that sexual services were being offered to customers at the establishment under the pretext of spa treatments. A decoy customer was subsequently sent and women were caught red-handed.

Three women — a local, a Nepalese and one from Sangli in Maharashtra — were rescued. Police said the accused lived off of the women’s earnings.

A case has been registered under provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Immoral Traffic Act. Joseph and Nidhinlal were produced before the Vasco JMFC and were remanded in six days police custody.

A fortnight ago, Nidhinlal was in the news after he accused Minerva Punjab FC of not paying his dues for eight months and denying him the no objection certificate (NOC) that would have allowed him to ply his trade with another club.

The former goalkeeper has been residing in Goa for over a year now and claimed he started a saloon to make ends meet. He also said he was training children from the locality.

274,['16/01/2020'],Forest dept rescues female leopard from Sinnar,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Nashik: The forest department has managed to trap a five-year-old female leopard from Sinnar area in rural Nashik on Wednesday morning.

Many villagers spotted the big cat along with her male counterpart in the sugar cane field of Vinchur-Dalvi village on Bhagur road around ten days back. Although the six-year-old male leopard was caught a week back, the female big cat was still on the run.

She was finally trapped at around 5.30 a.m. on Wednesday at the Vinchur-Gavli farm of the farmer Ramesh Kanade. Earlier, the labourers working at the farm refused to work on the farm after spotting the cats.

Acting on the complaints by the villagers, the forest department had put up a cage on the farm last week.

The forest department officials conducted a medical examination in which the male leopard was found fit and healthy. The leopard was then immediately released in forest areas following some official paperwork.

Finally, after a week, the five-year-old female leopard was caught by the forest department. “After completing the medical check-up of the female leopard, she will be released in the forest area shortly,” said an official from forest department.

Lately, many leopards have been spotted in different areas of the district.

In November, residents had spotted leopards at four locations in Sinnar taluka of the district. The forest department officials had put up cages and managed to trap them and release in wild.

Residents of Sulewadi village, Harsul village, Kanambe and Vinchur Dalwi village in Sinnar taluka also witnessed leopards in their vicinity.

Nashik: State-owned aerospace and defence company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited ( HAL ) has sought district administration ’s intervention to ensure that all highrise projects planned near the airport must seek a No Objection Certificate ( NOC ) from the company.

A meeting of HAL’s aerodrome committee, aerodrome emergency committee and airfield environment management committee was recently held with the district administration.

During the meeting, HAL officials reminded that since commercial flights operate from HAL airport at Ozar, all highrise projects coming up near the airport must get prior approval from the local airport authorities as instructed by Airports Authority of India ( AAI ).

The airport runway is 3.5-km-long, starting from Ozar and ends at Janori village. “We had a meeting with the district administration on safety issues. We are in discussion with them to make HAL’s NOC mandatory for construction of highrise buildings, but nothing has been finalised yet,” an official from HAL said.

“Safety guidelines for airports have been laid down by the AAI. It was just a primary discussion with the district administration. The height limit and areas where HAL’s NOC will be required is yet to be decided,” the official said.

The runway is in the east and west direction. “There are Janori and Mohadi villages on the east side of the airport that is a hilly area. Hence, there is not much issue on this side,” the official said.

“There is HAL township and Pimpalgaon area in the west direction of the runway. The issue of NOC will be only for highrise constructions on this side of the runway. Nashik city will not be affected as it is towards south of the runway,” he added.

The HAL will now prepare a proposal as per the civic aviation guidelines that will include the areas where the HAL’s NOC will be needed for highrise constructions.

Currently, TruJet and Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India, are operating flights from Nashik airport. Alliance Air is operating on the Hyderabad-Nashik and Nashik-Ahmedabad sectors, while TruJet is operating on Nashik-Ahmedabad route.

276,['16/01/2020'],Elephant attack deaths in state may cross 100,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Bhubaneswar: The human casualty in elephant attack in the current financial year (2019-20) is likely to cross the 100 mark, the highest ever since man-elephant conflict started becoming alarming in 1982.

Till January 12, 2020, 93 people have already been killed in the attack unleashed by the pachyderms. Last year (2018-19) till March 31, the casualty stood at 92. With more than two months to go for the current financial year to end, more people may fall prey to jumbo attack. This rate of human casualty is not even reported in elephant-rich Karnataka, where the average annual human casualty is 45.

Mostly in Dhenkanal, Angul, Athgarh, Baripada, Deogarh and Keonjhar forest divisions, the elephants have killed more persons compared to other divisions. The reason is that all these areas come under the three elephant reserves of Mayurbhanj, Mahanadi and Sambalpur, which accounts for 77.73% of total elephant population in the state.

In the three reserves, which have 18 divisions, the 2017 census had recorded presence of 1,536 elephants. In Dhenkanal division there are only 169 elephants, the second highest after Mayurbhanj district, which had recorded presence of 330 elephants in Similipal Tiger Reserve.

Sources said the one of the major reasons of the conflict is shrinking elephant habitat, resulting in them straying into human habitation in search of food. In the elephant-rich areas, the pachyderms move in herds and destroy standing paddy. The panicked and aggrieved villagers resort to chasing away the elephants using different means, which backfire.

The elephant show aggression and launch attack. Last year in July, forest minister Bikram Keshari Arukh told the assembly that 369 persons died in elephant attack between January 2015 and June 2019. Maximum deaths during this period were reported from Dhenkanal division.

Biswajit Mohanty, secretary, Wildlife Society of Odisha (WSO), a private body working for conservation of wildlife, said in many cases, depleting elephant habitats and transformation of land pattern in human habitation can be blamed for rise in the number of human deaths due to elephant attack.

“Lack of quality fodder is forcing pachyderms to leave their parent habitat and look for food elsewhere, especially in adjoining areas such as agricultural field in elephant-concentrated areas. This results in elephant confronting human population,” he said, adding the 14 elephant corridors identified are yet to be restored.

“If the government secures the elephant corridors, stop mining activities and building railway tracks, the elephant won’t stray into human habitation.”

The state has lost more than 1,500 elephants since 1990 due to reasons such as electrocution, poaching poisoning, gun shot, electrocution trap, train and road accidents and natural deaths. Despite repeated attempts, none from the forest department was available to comment on the matter.

NEW DELHI: The National Commission for Women (NCW) has accepted a complaint from Komal Sharma , a 20-year-old Delhi University student, who has accused a TV channel of allegedly “defaming and identifying her as one of the attackers in the violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University” on January 5. While approaching NCW on Wednesday, Sharma also claimed that she had not been approached by the media company to confirm its information.

TOI had reported that the woman was identified by a television channel after a sting conducted by it appeared to show her admitting to her involvement in the mob attack on students and teachers of JNU. The channel claimed that in a mobile phone photo of the violence in the university campus, Sharma could be seen holding a stick but had her face masked with a blue scarf. Based on the claims made by the TV channel, the student, who is believed to be a member of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, was asked by Delhi Police to join the probe into the events of January 5.

While identifying her, the TV channel had played an audio clip purportedly of Sharma admitting that the mobile phone shots of her had gone viral. She was then identified by another student of her DU college, who claimed Sharma was her junior in school. The sting also showed her pleading with the senior student not to disclose her identity.

The senior student has not yet stepped forward to confirm that the conversation between Sharma and her actually took place. The cops will probe this as well.

Police have not named the woman, though it said it had sought the video from the TV channel and will scan it to establish the person’s identity. The video aired by the news channel will also be sent for forensic analysis.

Panaji: The government’s decision to withdraw the panchayat department circular is a victory for panchayats and an admission by the government that the circular would not stand the test of judicial scrutiny, the Congress and the AAP said on Wednesday.

Opposition leader Digambar Kamat also welcomed panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho ’s decision to rescind the circular, which Kamat described as illegal.

“Our party had made this demand and it had to be withdrawn as it would have been struck down by the court and various panchayats were ready to approach the court,” Kamat said.

Chairman of Goa Panchayati Raj Sanghatan Joseph Sequeira also welcomed the development on behalf of the Congress. “This is a victory for the Panchayati Raj movement and the local self-bodies. We also warn the government not to play such gimmicks for the purpose of corruption,”he said.

AAP was also of the view that the circular violated the Panchayati Raj Act.

“The reasons adduced by the minister indicated that the government was convinced that the circular would not stand the test of judicial scrutiny and that the BJP risked alienating even their own panchayats,” AAP general secretary Pradeep Padgaonkar said. The party also criticised Godinho’s “intemperate language” against panchayats.

“The minister also says that the government will wield the stick against errant panchayats. He is not the schoolteacher to think that elected panchas are his school boys to wield a stick,” Padgaonkar said.

Panaji: Now, infrastructure like portable toilet blocks, changing rooms, cloakrooms, and solid waste management plants will be allowed within the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) at Miramar beach . A new notification by the Union environment ministry has relaxed CRZ norms for Blue Flag certification shortlisted beaches.

The Union environment ministry has listed 18 infrastructural facilities that can come up “maintaining a minimum distance of 10m from the high-tide line (HTL)”, in the January 9 notification. The other amenities for which CRZ norms have been relaxed are shower panels, grey water treatment plant, solar power plant, purified drinking water facility, beach access pathways, landscaping lighting, seating benches and sit-out umbrellas, outdoor play and fitness equipment.

The ministry, with a view to protect and conserve the environment and control and abate pollution in coastal beaches and sea waters, had identified beaches for the internationally recognised Blue Flag certification, which calls for responsible and sustainable amenities and infrastructure development, cleanliness, safety and security services.

The CRZ norms also stand relaxed for CCTV surveillance and control room, first-aid station, safety watch towers and beach safety equipments, beach layout, environment information boards and other signages, fencing (preferably vegetative), parking facilities, entry gate, tourist facilitation centre. Any other associated facilities or infrastructure, as per Blue Flag certification requirement, can also come up provided the minimum 10m from HTL is maintained.

The project is already being opposed by some local groups and fishermen stating that work on raising infrastructure at Miramar for Blue Flag certification should not begin until the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) for Goa is finalised.

Blue Flag certification from the Foundation for Education, Denmark, is a voluntary certification, where countries have to meet 33 criteria for chosen beaches. It is one of the most stringent certification related to sustainable ecotourism development of beaches encompassing high quality standards of water quality, safety of beach goers, public amenities, sound waste management plans, focus on renewable energy and water conservation, environment education, information on biodiversity and beach ecology.

The central government is helping fund the creation of infrastructure at identified beaches to prepare them to meet the certification standards.

Certified beaches are known to have increased footfalls from foreign tourists due to their cleanliness and preservation of the natural beauty.

In India, states were asked to nominate a beach and Goa had nominated Miramar, after an initial selection of Velsao. Goa is the only place where implementation of the project is delayed and Goa is set to ask for extension from the Centre in the two-year period during which central government funds infrastructure on the identified beaches.

Indian sellers on Amazon India platform exported goods worth $1 billion in a three-and-a-half year period ending May 2019, according to the company. Last year, Amazon India set a target of reaching $5 billion of exports by mid-2023.

“We are going to use Amazon’s size, scope and scale--we are going to use our global footprint to export $10 billion of Make in India goods by the year 2025,” Bezos said during an event organised by the Seattle-headquartered company in the capital.

As part of this exercise, Amazon will establish ‘Digital Haats’ in 100 cities, villages, and communities. These will provide services like e-commerce onboarding, imaging and cataloging, warehouse space, logistics, digital marketing, and compliance, Amazon said in a statement.

Amazon has emphasized that it is witnessing a steady rise in Indian sellers on its domestic platform selling more during major global events in the US, such as, Cyber Monday and Black Friday.

The company’s exit from China could also be a major reason behind its heightened focus on small businesses in India, where labour costs are relatively cheaper, said a senior industry executive, who did not wish to be quoted.

While the export target of $10 billion is ambitious, Ankur Pahwa, partner and national leader – e-commerce and consumer internet, EY India, said digital expansion through this initiative will certainly help propel the company towards the revised target.

“Globally, this is aligned to their small and medium business strategy which has been mentioned in their shareholder communications. They have a good commerce layer built already and this will help expand it further, including logistics, fintech and services,” he said.

Amazon, which launched operations in India in 2013, had committed an investment of $5 billion in India in June 2016, an amount which it has already surpassed. Bezos, whose personal net worth is currently pegged at $116 billion, has revealed his focus on small businesses even in Amazon’s home market, the US, where regulators are questioning the retailer’s dominance.

282,['16/01/2020'],Note on nods to mega projects withdrawn,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Porvorim: The state panchayat department blinked first as it withdrew a circular that had made it mandatory for builders of mega projects to approach block development officers (BDOs) and the department for construction nods and occupancy certificates instead of going to the village panchayats directly.

Though panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho claimed that the decision was taken to give panchayats a “second chance”, sources said that pressure, not just from the opposition, but from within BJP ranks, forced Godinho’s hand.

“We thought it prudent to withdraw the circular for the time-being, till we have our system in place, which means a technical cell and two more garbage treatment plants ready and MRF facilities in 90% of the panchayats,” Godinho told reporters at the ministerial block.

The panchayat department circular, dated January 7, had said that residential projects spread across over 200sqm have to submit applications for construction licenses and occupancy certificates to BDOs, who would inspect the project to check if it was compliant with garbage management norms.

Panchayats were up in arms over the move as they saw it as an encroachment on their powers. The real estate sector also expressed concern over the development as the circular could have led to an increase in delays and graft.

“I found out that this procedure will delay files as far as housing complexes are concerned. This will hit the real estate sector, which is the worst affected in the present slowdown,” Godinho said.

Sources said the chief minister’s office issued directions to the panchayat department to withdraw the circular, though Godinho insisted that he had not succumbed to political pressure. “We have not been forced by anyone. The government in its wisdom has decided to withdraw the circular,” he said.

He went on to say that the panchayat department was in the process of amending the Goa Panchayat Raj Act to introduce norms pertaining to garbage management and approvals for large residential or commercial projects.

“I can safely say there will be a proper system in place of the circular. Whatever we have to achieve can also be done by appropriate legislation and this means amending the Panchayat Raj Act. The emphasis is on managing garbage scientificallyand we have to move forward,” he said, adding that the department would release funds to all panchayats to set up material recovery facilities at the village level.

Representative image

NASHIK: The district canal advisory committee under the chairmanship of district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal has decided that the farmers would be given five rotations of water through the Gangapur Left Bank Canal.

In a meeting held in Mumbai, it was decided that the allocation of water would be given before July 31st, 2020. The committee looking at the availability of water and the demand for irrigation and drinking purposes schedules the tentative dates for releasing of water through the canal – referred to as rotation.

Due to an extensive monsoon season, the committee decided to give five rotations of water for agriculture as the dams also had good water collection in them.

Given the demand for water for irrigation purpose, the Water Resources Department (WRD) has said that there is ample water availability in the reservoirs yet they are taking precautions in the water consumption.

The district collector Suraj Mandhare said that the water storage in the reservoirs across the districts was 65.4 TMC this year during October 2019. The irrigation would get 10TMC water out of the 12TMC excess water in the reservoirs this year.

The advisory committee has said that the two rotations during rabbi crop cultivation would be given through the Gangapur project. And three remaining during the summer which means there would be ample water and thus the availability of vegetables during the summer season this year.

Since there were very fewer rains in the year 2018, there was a drought in the district and the administration had cut down the use of water for irrigation purposes during the summer and it had also regulated the water being used for rabbi crops.

On the other hand, the Godavari Left and Right Bank Canals that provide water to Kopargaon taluka in Ahmednagar and Vaijapur taluka in Aurangabad districts will also get three rotations for irrigation and one rotation for drinking water. Similarly from Palkhed Left Bank canal water will be released once for irrigation and twice for drinking the purpose during rabbi period and during summer season one rotation is being reserved for non-irrigation and contingency purposes. If the rains fail to arrive on time, a rotation of water may be reserved for Yeola, Manmad, and regional water supply scheme for 38 villages.

Two rotations of water for irrigation from Ozharkhed dam and one for drinking purpose has been scheduled during the rabbi season, the WRD officer said.

TimesView A portion of the city, where about a fifth of its population lives, has been choked for several months now. Work needs to be stepped up.

KOLKATA: Whether the new Majerhat bridge meets its April deadline or not now depends on the civil aviation ministry and not the railways.The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), under the ministry of civil aviation, has asked the state PWD to address some crucial construction issues before it approves the launching of the bridge’s superstructure over railway tracks. Delay in the CRS ’s sanction may push back the bridge’s commissioning further. The project has already missed its September 27 and December 31, 2019 deadlines. PWD’s revised internal deadline is April 2020.The commute lifeline for residents of Behala and beyond collapsed on September 4, 2018 and is being rebuilt since last January. It being a road overbridge ( ROB ), the structure needs the zonal railway’s nod at various steps. Certain approvals are also supposed to come from the CRS, which gives safety clearance to any railway project in the country.Last Friday, PWD, which is implementing the Majerhar ROB reconstruction project, gave a presentation to the CRS, which sought clarifications on how the structure would be under vibrations, on the precautions being taken for girder launching, design nitty-gritty of the cables—the ROB will be a cable-stayed bridge with pylons or towers on both sides supporting the deck—and finally, the instrumentation scheme. State officials said they would take some time, addressing the queries. “We may have to make an animation of the vibration analysis on getting accurate calculations,” a state official said. PWD must also prepare the ROB’s instrumentation scheme. TOI had reported in March that the bridge would be equipped with “instrumentation” or sensors to monitor the structure under static and dynamic vehicular load.Some time has already lost preparing the multi-media presentation. It’s been more than a fortnight since the commission asked PWD for the presentation on the Majerhat bridge construction as the latter applied for permission to start building the superstructure. The superstructure will be a continuous girder system spanning the railway tracks, built with the launched-girder erection technique or sequential erection of the girders, using high-capacity cranes.Last month, Eastern Railway (ER) cleared 22 designs related to this launching scheme, after PWD got them vetted by IIT-Bombay. But the final nod must come from CRS.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73295034,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-485102,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/crs-nod-delay-may-defer-majerhat-date/articleshow/73282117.cms

Panaji: Vice-chairman of the State Minorities Finance and Development Corporation Ashma Sayed resigned on Wednesday as a mark of protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ). Sayed is a member of GFP, which is part of the NDA .

Sayed presently heads GFP’s women wing. She was appointed vice chairperson on the reconstituted body in October 2018.

“I have resigned as vice chairman, Goa State Minorities Finance and Development Corporation as a mark of protest against CAA,” Sayed tweeted .

The corporation provides loans and other assistance to members of minority communities for entrepreneurship and education purposes.

GFP was part of the BJP-led Goa government till July 2019 when its three ministers were abruptly dropped from the Pramod Sawant-led cabinet in order to make way for MLAs who switched over from the Congress to the BJP .

GFP has also opposed CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The Centre has introduced the CAA, which came into effect on January 10, to grant Indian citizenship to refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, except Muslims, who migrated to India in a bid to escape religious persecution.

Massive protests have erupted across the country against the CAA and the NRC since its passage by Parliament in December last year.

A fortnight earlier, three Congress office bearers quit the Congress and joined the BJP in order to show support for CAA.

Nashik: Food, family and flying kites took the centre stage on Wednesday as people in Nashik celebrated the harvest festivals of Makar Sankranti and Pongal with great fervour .

The celebrations for the Maharashtrains had a distinct sweet note with til-gul (sesame and jaggery) being exchanged. People also took dips in the Godavari to mark Makar Sankranti — the day when the Sun begins its Uttarayan journey towards the northern hemisphere.

“The Sankranti festival marks several important things with respect to nature and the Cosmos. The Sun, after winter solstice on December 21, begins its northward journey and this is celebrated as sankrant (transformation) period,” Sanjay Khatale, a school teacher, said.

Meanwhile, the cloudy skies and a warm day failed to dampen the spirits of the kite flyers who started thronging terraces early in the morning. “I have been waiting for the festival for long. I bought a dozen kites about a month ago, but had promised my parents that I would fly them only on Sankranti. Today I am enjoying flying these kites,” said Krishna Nikam, a Class XI student.

Women prepared a mixed vegetable delicacy known as ‘Bhogi’. “It is typically a mixed vegetable dish, but the ingredients are the choicest,” said Sanjeevani Kulkarni. Made using carrots, fresh green chickpeas, flat green beans, tomato — generally all winter vegetables — the dish is the special preparation for the day and is enjoyed with millet bread or bhakri.

The Sun is also worshipped during the period as Ratha Saptami is celebrated 15 days after this festival. During this period, Suryanamaskar, a set of yoga asanas, is practised. “Suryanamaskar is the 12-count exercise and 12 names of Surya (Sun) are recited. It is the best exercise and this period is sort of a campaign for this exercise,” said Ramesh Kadam, a yoga teacher.

Members of the Tamil community, meanwhile, celebrated Pongal by making sweet dishes and offering prayers.

“Today is the first day of the three-day Pongal celebrated by Tamilians. The day beings with traditional prayers and sweets are offered to the Sun before it rises in the morning,” Kannan Murugan Pillai, vice-president of the Tamil Sangam in Nashik, said.

The people get up early, offer prayers, prepare special food and offer the same to the Sun god. Thereafter, people exchange greetings. Sweet Pongal or Chakkara Pongali (Telugu) or Sakkarai Pongal (Tamil) is the sweet dish prepared on the day with moong dal, ghee and jaggery. “The next day will be celebrated as harvest day. We will also have cultural programmes for the community on January 26,” Pillai added.

288,['16/01/2020'],South Western Railway proposes underpasses for wild animal safety,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Margao: Apart from a number of road overbridges and subways for vehicular traffic along the Kulem-Vasco route, the South Western Railway ( SWR ) has planned several underpasses and canopy bridges to facilitate safe movement of wild animals . The route cuts across forest areas between Castlerock and Collem.

General manager of Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd, Shashibhushan Sahoo, told TOI that the work of planning and designing suitable engineering structures for animal crossing was under way as per the mitigating measures recommended by the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (IISc) which conducted the environmental impact assessment for the Collem-Margao railway line doubling project and submitted a mitigation plan.

The report suggests construction of some underpasses along the railway track on the stretch between Collem and Sonaulim railway stations owing to “concentration of gaur signs” in the area.

“Low fencing can be erected on both sides of the railway track at certain places to funnel smaller mammals towards an underpass. Specific stretches, except for high terrain, may also be fenced where needed to guide larger animals towards a bigger underpass,” the report reads.

To facilitate safe crossing of arboreal species like Malabar giant squirrel and primates such as bonnet macaque and South Indian grey plains langur over the railway track, the IIS report has recommended construction of a canopy bridge using low cost material. The report also suggests designing of appropriate types of structures for allowing animals of different body sizes to cross.

As regards the Collem-Kalay stretch, the IIS, in its report, recommended construction of one large underpass “considering the passage for large mammals such as gaur, and a “suitable engineering structure to allow animal funneling along the adjoining stretch to increase the chances of them crossing the underpass.” Two more underpasses, one for passage of small mammals and the other for passage of large animals have also been recommended.

“Most of the recommendations as regards to construction of underpasses and canopy bridges are being implemented along the route,” Sahoo said.

GURUGRAM: The residents of sectors 80-92 on Wednesday filed a complaint with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) informing them about the rampant encroachment along the green belt in the area. The residents alleged that squatters have destroyed the green belt in the area and have also illegally set up makeshift shops.

The area houses several highrises that include Mapsko Casa Bella, Sare Homes, Royal Ville, Antriksh Heights, Vatika India Next and Lifestyle Homes and at least 10,000 families are residing there.

GMDA is responsible for the maintenance of the green belts in these sectors. “Encroachments on the green belts is growing at a fast rate. If they go unchecked, the will soon turn into permanent structures. Grocery stores, horticulture shops, smalls markets are coming up on the green belt, slowly turning into a commercial area,” said Praveen Mallik, a resident of Sare Homes.

“The green belts act like a protective layer against the dust pollutants. We need more green cover in the area. As these sectors are still being developed, lots of construction is going on here leading to dust pollution. Some of the vacant plots too have been encroached upon where slums and illegal markets have come up,” said Sandeep Kumar, a resident of Sector 88.

Another resident of Sector 91, Jasvinder Singh, said, “Even as civic agencies had carried out survey in these sectors for development and protection of green belts, no action was taken against the squatters.”

When contacted, GMDA officials confirmed that they have received complaints about encroachments in new sectors and are working towards a solution. “We will soon conduct a survey of the area and remove the encroachments. At present, we are working to develop the green belts in the newly developed sectors,” a senior GMDA official said.

NASHIK: Ambad police on Wednesday arrested a man, while detaining two juveniles, in connection with five house break-in cases committed in the past two months.

Police have also recovered stolen articles worth Rs 6 lakh from the suspects. “A case of house break-in was registered with us on December 22, 2019. The complainant in the case, a cushion maker, had lost cash and articles worth Rs 1.27 lakh,” a police officer said.

“Subsequently, we plunged into action to trace the suspects. While patrolling the Ambad area on Sunday at 6am, we came across two juveniles moving suspiciously near the Cidco post office. They were carrying sports shoes in their hands. When we stopped and asked them about the shoes, the duo said they had stolen it up from a house,” he added.

Later, the juveniles informed the police that two of their acquaintances were into committing burglaries and they are staying in the Pandav Leni area of Ambad.

When the police scanned the forest area of Pandav Leni, they found some clothes, sports shoes and beer cans. On Monday, police started inquiring about the suspects and got the address of a juvenile in Vaitagwadi slum area of Ambad.

“When the juvenile was detained and grilled, he gave the name of his associates and confessed to have committed burglaries in Bhagat Singh Chowk, Shivaji Chowk, Ashwin Nagar and Ambad MIDC areas,” the officer said.

Police then detained the other juvenile and recovered gold articles, LCD TV, two gas cylinders, copper wires and copper utensils and a pressure cooker. “We later arrested a 24-year-old man from whom we recovered gold jewellery worth Rs 1.15 lakh,” he added.

Valpoi: Villagers of Sattari, under the banner of Sattari Bhumiputra Sanghatna (SBS), have decided to march to the forest department’s office at Valpoi on Friday to protest the harassment meted out to them by forest officials in Sattari.

At a meeting held at a temple in Caranzol late on Tuesday, members blamed the forest department for the tiger deaths at Golauli. “The department has been blaming people from the Dhangar community (for the tiger deaths), when it has not taken the matter seriously despite attacks on livestock by the big cat. This shows that forest officials are inactive,” SBS president Harishchandra Gawas said.

SBS member Antonio Pinho said a chargesheet had been filed against four active members of the group — including Gawas and himself — last year, after unidentified individuals set fire to the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary office at Kumthol, on May 28, the same day that SBS held a protest rally over land rights issues. “We have been issued summons to be present before the Valpoi JMFC on Friday. On the same day, SBS will hold a protest dharna in front of the Valpoi forest department office,” Pinho said.

293,['16/01/2020'],Traffic congestion becomes even more serious at Central Bus Stand after smart road construction,"This story is from January 16, 2020

NASHIK: The Central Bus Stand (CBS) junction, one of the busiest in the city, has become even messier after the pilot ‘smart’ road project work.

Despite the junction being thrown open to traffic over a month ago, after the smart road ’s construction, incidents of traffic snarls have only increased.

The smart road project, which began in June 2018, is still underway. Currently, work near the Ashok Stambh junction has been taken up. However, the rest of the road has been thrown open to vehicular traffic.

While the place may visually look good, the smart works have done little to streamline the traffic on this busy stretch. Motorists coming from the Trimbak Naka side are finding it difficult to take a free left towards the Sharanpur Road from the CBS junction.

Many commuters said the footpath has been extended too much on the corners of the junction. As a result, the free left has become a 90-degree turn. To make matters worse, autorickshaw operators are also seen waiting for passengers right at this 90-degree turning.

Further, even the free-left from the Shalimar side toward Trimbak Naka has been blocked by an autorickshaw stand. Thus motorists from Shalimar are having a tough time taking a left from the junction.

A senior police officer said about three weeks ago, the signal at the CBS junction was opened. However, taking into account the vehicular chaos it caused, we decided to shut it down. The traffic officer said that motorists coming from the Trimbak Naka side and looking to move towards Sharanpur Road on their left, were continuously honking at the motorists in front of them at the road signal. The situation was the same even for motorists moving from Shalimar towards the Trimbak Naka side. In view of the huge chaos, the traffic signal was closed down.

Police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil said, “A report about the problems being faced at the CBS junction will be sought from our traffic officers to take the necessary measures.”

The police said if needed, they would also speak to the officials of the Nashik Municipal Corporation to take the corrective measures at the junction.

294,['16/01/2020'],Love jihad making Kerala girls sex slaves: Church,"This story is from January 16, 2020

KOCHI: Keralite Christian girls are being targeted and killed in the name of “love jihad”, the 28th synod of the Syro-Malabar Church has said.

“Many are even scared to use the term ‘ love jihad ’ but the synod has now come out and said the exact words. There are reports of Christian girls getting converted and taken abroad. They are not living an ideal pious life either. They are made to live with more than one person and some are even pushed into becoming sex slaves,” said Syro-Malabar media commission secretary Fr Antony Thalachelloor on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, the church said it would begin a sensitisation campaign against the issue through Sunday schools. Sources within the church said they were planning to use all their lay organisations to make Christian youth cautious about the “threat”.

Fr Thalachelloor said the recent incidents in Kozhikode in which a 19-year-old woman was sexually abused and blackmailed into converting and instances of Christian women joining Islamic State were examples that got the church worried. “It has also come to our notice that a Christian teenager was brutally stabbed to death after getting lured into an affair. Love affairs used to happen earlier as well, but the church cannot overlook girls, especially Christian girls, getting targeted and later murdered on the pretext of ‘love’,” he said.

The synod said if movements like “love jihad” grew stronger they would endanger communal harmony in Kerala . It pointed out that around half of the 21 youths recruited to IS from the state were Christians. “It is a concern that several girls who are not accounted for in official records are being used for terrorist activities through love jihad. Statistics show that love jihad is not an illusion. It is a sad fact that police are not taking appropriate action in complaints,” it said.

Synod, however, said that they don’t observe Love Jihad in a way that it would affect the friendship between religions in the state. It said the authorities should look at it as a menace that would negatively affect the society.

NASHIK: The Nashik rural police have arrested three more people, including the main suspect , in the attempt to murder, sodomy and atrocities case that took place in Dari village — around 14-km from Nashik city, on Thursday night.

The main suspect, a 29-year-old resident of Mataji Chowk, and two others were arrested by rural police from Nandurbar district on the night between Tuesday and Wednesday.

A total of nine people had assaulted the two victims, who had gone to play music at the birthday party of the main suspect organised at a farm house in Dari village.

After the party got over, the suspects picked up an argument with the victims over sound quality of the music system and started assaulting them with sticks and belts. They also administered electric shocks on the victims through a battery like equipment in order to kill them.

After stripping the victims, they were forced to indulge in unnatural sex. Meanwhile, the suspects also made casteist remarks after they came to know that one of the victims belonged to scheduled caste.

The victims managed to escape from the place and returned home after the suspects had fallen to sleep. Later, in the afternoon they got admitted at the Nashik civil hospital.

By Saturday evening, a total of six suspects were arrested who were later remanded in five-day police custody. Under the guidance of SP Arti Singh, four teams were prepared and sent to Dhule, Jalgaon, Thane and Nandurbar districts to arrest the remaining three suspects.

298,['16/01/2020'],Petition for night public transport in Panaji support garners support,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Panaji: Over 100 citizens have signed a petition to Kadamba Transport Corporation and the transport minister, by Goa Road Safety Forum seeking public transportation at night in the capital city of the tourist state.

Public transportation is almost non-existent after 8pm in the capital city which hosts a slew of national and international programmes and caters to a large number of tourists.

The forum is pushing for KTC to start regular bus services between 7pm to 11pm along the inner roads of the city which will also connect residential zones.

The petition has also provided a set of routes marked on a map to connect major residential zones with important locations in the city.

“Panaji witnesses several events throughout the year. Several of these events are organised late into the night. Additionally, there are social gatherings and family functions which are mostly organised during the late hours,” the petition reads, adding that attendees are currently left with no choice but to use their personal vehicles.

Several businesses operate that operate late night too require secure and reliable public transportation for their employees. The buses need to have accessibility features as well as sufficient inner illumination for safety reasons, the petition states.

“The use of personal vehicles out of helplessness is resulting in a severe burden on the city in terms of congestion, pollution and overall disturbance of peace. The capital city of a state deserves much better public transport facilities than this,” says founder of Goa Road Safety Forum, Dilip Naik.

“Initially there may not be demand but once people know that public transportation is available late night, they will avail of it,” Naik adds.

The petition with over 100 signatures has been sent to the KTC chairman Carlos Almeida, transport minister Mauvin Godinho and Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate, among others.

“A service such as this will prove to be a boon to both locals as well as tourists and help in getting rid of traffic congestion,” the petition further states.

Panaji: The Congress on Wednesday chided chief minister Pramod Sawant for criticising India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and asked Sawant to instead study the role played by RSS in India’s Independence movement.

Addressing a press conference, state Congress president Girish Chodankar said that Sawant’s statements had exposed the latter’s ignorance.

“When India got its independence, the RSS was sad because they wanted the British to remain in India. He (Sawant) should explain how many RSS leaders participated in the Independence struggle, and what was their contribution?” said Chodankar.

A day earlier, Sawant blamed the first prime minister of India for the delay in the Liberation of Goa. Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginald Lourenco also expressed his disappointment with Sawant’s remarks.

“The statement is in bad taste and this speaks volumes of the status to make such a hollow statement. The world knows Nehru’s contribution to independence of India and later Liberation of Goa,” said Lourenco.

Meanwhile, Chodankar also called for Sawant to step down due to his inability to handle the state’s finances, resolve the Mhadei water diversion issue and restart Goa’s mining operations.

“He cannot control the state as he has not studied anything, whether it is finance, mining, Mhadei or law and order, and he should resign in the interest of Goa. He wants to blame Nehru for everything, and soon he will blame Nehru for shutting down mining and for Mhadei,” said Chodankar.

300,['16/01/2020'],Maharashtra: Two sloth bears rescued from Chimur farm well,"This story is from January 16, 2020

A net was used to cover the well

CHANDRAPUR: Two sloth bears were rescued from a farm well close to Savri village in Chimur tehsil during wee hours of Wednesday after an overnight rescue operation.

The adult bears, male and female, leaping to pluck berries in the farm of Rajendra Nikose had accidentally slipped into the well having no parapet wall on Tuesday afternoon.

Chimur range forest officer Bhavik Chiwande informed that the well was partially closed and was out of use. After the matter came to the knowledge of Nikose, he informed range forest office.

A team led by RFO Chiwande immediately reached the spot. Rescue was quite easy as the well was just 10 feet deep. Putting a ladder inside the well would have solved the problem and bears would have come out. However, villagers were opposed to this type of rescue, he said.

The villagers claimed that the bear couple was roaming in the area for the last several days and people working in the farms around were terrified, said Chiwande. As the villagers wanted the foresters to capture the bears and release them in a distant jungle, they opposed use of ladder.

“I talked to senior officers in the light of new situation and they agreed to take up capturing operation. However, veterinary doctor refused to tranquillize the bears as there was some water in the well and the beats could have drowned. Hence, we covered the entire well with a net and bamboo mats and slid a couple of ladders inside. Cage was put at the mouth of the well in such a way that when bears come out, they have no other way but to walk into the cage,” said Chiwande.

The bears climbed out during the wee hours of Wednesday and were trapped into the cage. They were removed from the spot and released in a distant forest after mandatory medical examination, he told.

Patrolling team, staff of Special Tiger Protection Force and foresters of Chimur range jointly undertook the rescue operation under the supervision of ACF RM Wakade.

A rescued bird being treated

JAIPUR: Over 400 birds were injured because of kite strings on Makar Sankranti on Tuesday. Throughout Wednesday, bird camps were held in various places with volunteers rushing to help save the avians.

In Jain Pakshi Chikitsalaya in Johri Bazar, more than 350 injured birds including eagles and owls have been brought to their hospital. “Their feathers have deep cuts caused by Chinese manjha that have glass coating. We have advised people to get the birds to our hospital as soon as possible to avoid blood loss,” said Pramod Jain, doctor at the bird hospital. Volunteers rescuing injured birds were ferrying them in boxes to temporary medical camps, but the baskets fell short as the number of injured birds increased as the day progressed. At Ramniwas Bagh bird camp by RAKSHA NGO, volunteers from all over the country were working all day operating the birds. “We have been getting calls for injured birds till late night. At around 10pm on Tuesday, we rescued a barn owl from Raja Park. We have two four wheelers and 15 bike ambulances working in the city. Since, our camp was organised on January 13, we have rescued more than 400 birds,” said Ushma Patel, avian medicine specialist.

Though the birds are grievously injured, strictness on curbing the Chinese manjha by police reduced incidents.

According to different NGO, as compared to last year, the number of birds injured have gone down.

Saligao: The authorities on Wednesday demolished 12 structures at Guirim as part of the national highway expansion project.

The exercise was carried out in the presence of engineers of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and the joint mamlatdar. A strong police force was deployed to maintain law and order.

Seven structures located along the stretch from Guirim to Panaji were brought down entirely by heavy earthmoving machinery while a portion of five structures located on the other side of the highway were also demolished.

Demolition notices were served in December last year to the owners of the houses that were demarcated for demolition. They were told to vacate the structures.

Those affected were supported by the local panchayat and Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar.

“The affected people were promised rehabilitation. But the demolition was carried out beforehand,” Salgaonkar said.

The four- and six-laning project is part of the Union ministry of road transport and highways’ plan to widen NH 66 from Panvel right up to Kanyakumari.

The expansion work includes a 3-kilometre elevated corridor at Porvorim, an underpass-cum-overbridge at Karaswada, two underpass-cum-overbridges at Colvale, one at the Camaracazana-Gaunsavaddo intersection, and one at the Green Park junction.

While one underpass-cum-overbridge structure has already been thrown open for traffic at the Tar-Bastora junction, the structure at Guirim is nearing completion.

The entire project is being funded by the road ministry and the NHAI.

In 2009, the court ruled in favour of the farmers, agreeing with the complainants and ordering the mining firms to compensate farmers for the loss of agricultural farms and for causing pollution.

The verdict pronounced a compensation of Rs 3.4 crore to around 761 farmers. The then deputy collector, Arvind Bugde had distributed Rs 16 lakh from this amount among 34 farmers after verifying their documents.

The balance amount was retained by the high court and this has now risen to Rs 7.8 lakh.

NAGPUR: Both factions of Save Merit Save Nation (SMSN) movement, which had originated at Nagpur, have decided to file an objection to the application by an Aurangabad group with the Election Commission of India (ECI) to register a political party named ‘Save Merit Save nation’ under the Representation of People’s Act 1951.

A notice has been published in a local Marathi newspaper at Jalna on January 14. It reads that any organization or individual having objection to this name may register a protest with the ECI. One Meena Avadheshkumar Singh is national president while Shrushti Shivkumar Ram is designated as treasurer of this proposed party. Both are residents of CIDCO, Aurangabad.

The Save Merit Foundation at Nagpur has claimed that the name ‘Save Merit Save Nation’ and its logo are their intellectual property and they will file an objection with the ECI.

“Our logo was designed by creative designer Harshad Bhisikar of Nagpur and we officially purchased it. We are using it till date. We won’t tolerate any misuse of this logo or name to gain political mileage to confuse people,” said Dr Sanjay Deshpande, president of SMSN.

“We have an official bank account in the name of ‘Save Merit Save Nation’ with a nationalized bank. But growth of the movement is bringing in politically inclined people to exploit our goodwill for furthering their selfish political agenda,” said Dr Anup Marar, SMSN secretary.

The SMSN movement was initiated in 2019 to protest excessive reservation in education after the state government implemented SEBC and EWS quotas. In 2019 assembly elections, SMSN forum got divided into two factions. One appealed to its members to exercise NOTA option in election while others preferred to stay apolitical. The political party’s move coming from Aurangabad has surprised both the factions.

“Irrespective of political stand during elections, we are sure that SMSN movement is a social movement and we are not going to fight elections. Some people who want to take advantage of the popularity of this name want to register it as a political party. Our team from Aurangabad will raise objections against it,” said Dr Anil Laddhad, state president of the SMSN faction that had appealed to members to select NOTA option.

Demand for general category census in 2021

Office bearers of SMSN have demanded census 2021 should collect separate information on general category people. “MLAs in state have unanimously asked the Central government to collect data regarding OBCs in the upcoming census 2021. We support this demand. With SC, ST and OBCs, government should also include all categories comprising open/general category for data collection,” states a memorandum SMSN submitted to Nagpur district collector Ravindra Thakre.

They also sought that the data collection should be more comprehensive and must include a precise assessment of present social, economic, cultural and educational status of all categories with a regular phase-wise, timely review mechanism in place.

JAIPUR: The IAS officer was duped of approximately Rs 2.5 lakh, though the police managed to recover most of the amount. In the second case, an official of the secretariat was duped of Rs 50,000, which is yet to be recovered. Both the incidents happened on January 12.

In both the cases, a person had messaged asking the fraud victims to update their Paytm KYC details and make an online transaction of Rs 1. The accused had already hacked the victims’ phone and used it to take the One Time Password to withdraw money from their bank accounts.

The advisory said that no information regarding bank accounts should be shared over phone even if the caller knows the name as well as other details of the person who is being called. Also while shopping online, no advance amount should be paid and in case if this is done, then the shopper should take a photo id of the person who is being paid. Also cases have been reported when the conmen have pretended to be a defence personnel and people should be cautious of such people without confirming their identity.

While selling on sites like OLX, Quicker and others, people also have to be careful as in many instances the conmen pretend to be buyers and claim that they will transfer the money in the seller’s account but instead money is withdrawn using various methods of hacking if account details are shared.

The advisory also says that a person should always use ATM card alone without taking help from strangers in the booth. Also ATM machines in isolated locations should be avoided as these are easy target for fraudsters who put schemer machines on these ATMs.

Unconfirmed and dubious SMSs and links should also not be forwarded. Apart from these the advisory says that one must not search for customer care numbers online as they can be of the fraudsters who ask to download particular apps which helps them in hacking the targets bank account or e-wallets.

Cyber police has advised to refrain from falling into the trap of winning online lotteries and to be extremely cautious if someone calls asking for payment for approving a bank loan or for jobs. One time passwords must not be shared.

Work of water diversion from the Mhadei to Karnataka in connivance with the Centre has already begun

PANAJI: Work of water diversion from the Mhadei to Karnataka in connivance with the Centre has already begun, yet the ruling in Goa, including chief minister Pramod Sawant, continue to pay lip-service with rhetoric like not a drop of Mhadei water will be diverted, Goa Suraksha Manch president Subhash Velingkar said. Only two years are left for the state assembly elections and the issue will spell doom for the ruling in Goa, he said.

To create awareness about the water diversion issue, 108 couples will worship a pot full of water collected from all nine tributaries of Mhadei river, at Shree Saptakoteshwar temple in Narve on February 9, he said. The programme was initiated on the occasion of Makar Sankranti on Wednesday, Velingkar said.

“This programme has been taken up under the organisation Bharat Mata Ki Jai and we have called it Mhadeimata Poojan Abhiyan. The programme began informally at Shree Sateri Mandir in Surla, Sattari on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. The programme will be held in 15 villages one by one, where water from the nine tributaries will be collected locally and worshipped in each of the local temples. Finally, the pot full of water from all these programmes will be worshipped at Shree Saptakoteshwar temple by 108 couples,” said Velingkar, adding that 105 organisations, including GSM, will be participating in the programme.

Altogether, 1500 men and women will be part of the Mhadeimata Pooja Abhiyan and take an oath to ‘free Mhadei’, Velingkar said.

“The water collected will go to all 12 talukas and it will be worshipped at each place. Devotion forms an important part of life in Goa and therefore we decided to create awareness about the Mhadei water diversion issue through this route. Meeting of workers of all the participating organisations will also be held to mobilise them for Mhadeimata Poojan Abhiyan, on January 20 in Swami Vivekanand hall in Porvorim and on January 21 at Lingayat hall in Margao,” he said.

Velingkar also appealed to all opposition political parties in Goa to shed their party affiliations and come together to fight for the lifeline of Goa, Mhadei, on a common platform. “If that happens, it can shake this government out of its complacence,” he said.

311,['16/01/2020'],"With BSY facing financial crisis, policy paralysis hurting K’taka","This story is from January 16, 2020

Bengaluru: Last year’s floods, which ravaged 22 districts, have proved a massive stumbling block for BS Yediyurappa’s administration since it has laid bare the state exchequer. This is reflected in the fact that the CM is unable to announce fresh policies or envisage populist schemes.

While he inherited the populist Rs 42,000 crore farm loan waiver scheme from the previous coalition government, Yediyurappa further reduced room to manoeuvre by announcing an additional Rs 4,000 for each beneficiary farmer under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Yojana and Rs 5 lakh for reconstruction of each house destroyed by the floods. Incidentally, those are the only “magnanimous” announcements by the CM in the last six months.

Finance department officials say the enhanced compensation and the farm loan waiver have taken a serious toll on the fiscal situation in Karnataka, which is also facing an economic slowdown.

“We admit the initial few months have been quite slow. However, over the past couple of months, we have been doing a decent job on disbursing relief for flood victims,” said law minister JC Madhuswamy, confirming the lacklustre start to Yediyurappa’s fourth stint at the helm.

However, finance department officials suggest the worst is yet to come.

“With our own revenue collection at 70% and with the economy showing no sign of picking up pace in the fourth quarter, allocating funds for the 2020-21 budget will be a tough ask,” said one official. “If central funds do not amount to at least 70% of what was promised, we are likely to see a serious financial crisis.”

Yediyurappa admitted as much during the fiasco at the Davanagere Panchamasali Mutt on Tuesday. “Everybody knows the toll which the floods extracted. If I admit there is a financial crisis then it will be headlines in every newspaper. Please understand my position and support me,” Yediyurappa said at the function.

Added to the fiscal crisis, the political predicament also appears to be taking a toll on Yediyurappa and governance. With lack of support from the central leadership, his hands have been tied for even the simplest of decisions like expanding his cabinet.

Party sources say the cadre is unhappy, thanks to the delay in expanding the cabinet and appointing presidents to boards and corporations.

“The writing on the wall suggests further delays. Despite threats from new legislators and our own party functionaries, the CM is unable to expand his cabinet without the central leadership’s assent. So where is the question of appointments to boards and corporations which we cadre have been eagerly waiting for?” said one party functionary.

Ahmedabad: A 36-year-old man from Sarkhej on Tuesday filed a complaint with police alleging that he was beaten up by four men on Monday, when he objected to them selling Chinese manja.

In his FIR, Mohammed Firoz Shaikh, who works for a private security agency, said that he had learned from his friends that a man named Zaheer Dalal was selling Chinese manja. “I went to meet Dalal about this tried to persuade him not to sell Chinese manja as it could end up killing human beings,” Shaikh stated in the FIR.

Shaikh alleged that Dalal did not like the advice and began abusing Shaikh. As Shaikh remonstrated, Dalal and three of his family members assaulted him and one of them slashed Shaikh on his biceps.

Dalal also filed a complaint alleging that Shaikh was no activist but rather wanted Chinese manja from Dalal.

Dalal alleged that Shaikh and three others had come to his shop on Monday night asking for Chinese manja from him. “As I told him that I do not sell Chinese manja and could give some other good quality manja, Shaikh began alleging that I sell Chinese manja. When I told him not make baseless allegations, he began beating me,” said Dalal.

Dalal alleged that Shaikh and his three aides attacked him and his family members with swords and iron rods. Sarkhej police also registered an FIR for assault, criminal intimidation and abetment against Shaikh and three others.

313,['16/01/2020'],Nagpur: High Court to start final hearing of irrigation scam PILs from Feb 13,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Irrigation scam

NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court would be commencing final hearing of multi-crore irrigation scam cases from February 13.

On Wednesday, a division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Milind Jadhav informed the respective counsels for petitioners and respondents that all their contentions and applications would be heard regularly from February 13.

Earlier, Janmanch counsel Firdos Mirza argued on a new application filed by him demanding institution of probe under sitting/retired judge from the Supreme Court or high court under the Commission of Enquiries Act, 1952. He explained the circumstances behind the demand to handover the probe from state’s Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to the judge.

Justifying the NGO’s prayer, Mirza stated with change of guard in the state, it’s pertinent to witness change in the agency as those made respondent in the PILs were occupying top positions in the government and there was every possibility of manipulation.

Opposing the demand, senior counsels — PK Dhakephalkar and Anil Sakhare — appearing for deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and Engineers Welfare Association, respectively, contended that investigating agency couldn’t be changed at this stage. According to them, the probe has already progressed significantly and many FIRs were lodged by the ACB and charge sheets also filed in some cases.

Responding to the arguments, Mirza said people wouldn’t get justice unless an independent inquiry is conducted into the entire scam.

Both senior counsels, however, demanded rejection of the applications filed by the petitioners — Janmanch and social worker Atul Jagtap through counsel Shridhar Purohit.

The judges, however, clarified that they would be considering both applications by the petitioners. They asked the respondents to file their reply on merits of both the applications which would be heard with all five PILs — first by Janmanch (PIL No. 12/2016) and four others by Jagtap (PILs No. 141, 142, 172 & 173/2016) — from February 13 onwards.

Earlier on Tuesday, Ajit Pawar broke his silence by filing an affidavit wherein he opposed the petitioners’ demand to handover the probe into Rs70,000 crore scam case to either Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or Enforcement Directorate (ED). Demanding dismissal of both applications by imposing pecuniary costs on the petitioners, the deputy CM granted a “clean chit” to himself by refuting all allegations against him.

Janmanch, in its latest application, contended that since Pawar is in influential position as deputy CM, it doesn’t trust the investigating agency (ACB) anymore, as it’s directly functioning under the state government. The NGO, through its adviser Sharad Patil, accused ACB of making all out efforts to save the Baramati MLA by “creating incorrect records and misleading the judiciary”.

Janmanch said in the changed political scenario where Pawar is playing a major role in the government, it doesn’t have faith in ACB or CBI which is in direct control under the state or central governments, respectively.

Gujarat high court

AHMEDABAD: A division bench of the Gujarat high court has dismissed an appeal filed by a member of the Sikh community seeking compensation for the damages sustained by the community in Ahmedabad during the riots that followed the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

Sardar Jagjitsingh Khanuja filed the appeal in October last year after a single judge had rejected his petition for compensation for 60 Sikh families in Gujarat. The division bench last week said that the collector had then submitted a detailed report after examining the complaint of losses suffered during the riots. The report did not indicate “any loss having been suffered by the appellants”. Moreover, there is a long lapse of time, almost 30 years, by now and there are no factual details provided to justify a claim in such a situation, when the questions of fact were highly disputed and require a threadbare examination, the HC said.

In 2015, Khanuja had approached the HC seeking directions to the Ahmedabad district collector to compensate members of the Sikh community for the losses sustained during the 1984 violence. The HC was not convinced with an FIR and few statements to substantiate the claim of damages and loss of the properties.

The single judge as well as the division bench noted that a PIL was also filed in 2012 with similar prayers, but it was not entertained. Moreover, the district collector’s report also did not indicate that there was any loss recorded during the riots. This led the HC to raise question on veracity of claims. Moreover, the HC said that the cause for 60 families was espoused by a few “non-suited” persons.

Margao: Two years after shifting the Shigmo parade to the Colva circle-Ravindra Bhavan route, Margao Municipal Council (MMC) opposition councillors during Wednesday’s meeting demanded that it be shifted back to the earlier route within the town, from Holy Spirit Church square to MMC square.

However, with chairperson Pooja Naik stoutly rejecting the demand, opposition councillors threatened to have their way thereby indicating that a showdown with the ruling councillors over the issue was on the cards.

“The route has been approved by traffic police and the district collector. It has been made into a permanent venue for holding Carnival and Shigmo parades. We can’t change the route now,” Naik said.

Later speaking to reporters, Opposition councillors adopted a defiant stand. “This year the Carnival and Shigmo parades will be held on the streets of Margao. We will make it happen,” BJP councillor Ketan Kurtarkar said.

The face off between ruling and councillors over the parade route signifies a turf war. The parade route was shifted to the present route by then deputy chief minister Vijai Sardesai. With Sardesai out of the cabinet now and Margao MLA Digambar Kamat not on cosy terms with the Fatorda MLA, the BJP intends to regain lost ground by relocating the parade venue to the traditional route.

The controversy over MMC’s jaunt to Mt Abu, Rajasthan, came to the fore at the meeting, with opposition councillors questioning Naik’s decision to cancel the study tour bowing to objections from certain quarters. After a fiery discussion, Naik said those willing to go to would be permitted to do so, but stressed that she along with the other 10 Fatorda councillors wouldn’t participate in the tour.

316,['16/01/2020'],MSEDCL proposes moderate hike in power tariff,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Nagpur: State discom MSEDCL has proposed a moderate hike in power tariff for 2020-21. This time, it has proposed a slight increase in energy charges for domestic consumers, but fixed charges will depend on your consumption now.

There is some relief for consumers as the wheeling charges have been reduced. The higher-end consumers have been spared sharp hikes as MSEDCL fears that they may switch over to solar.

MSEDCL has filed a tariff petition for the next five years. Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) will fix the tariff based on objections and suggestions given by consumers. The consumers can submit the same to MERC by February 4. The first public hearing will be held in Pune on February 6 and final one in Nashik on February 15.

The Nagpur hearing will be on February 11. The copy of detailed petition can be obtained from the local chief engineer’s office by paying the stipulated charges.

Currently, the fixed charges were Rs90 per month for domestic consumers irrespective of the consumption. MSEDCL has proposed to levy it depending on your consumption. If your consumption is up to 100 units, it will be Rs100, if it is between 101 and 500 units, it will be Rs110, and if it’s above 500 units, then it will be Rs120 per month.

The wheeling charges have been reduced from Rs1.21 per unit to Rs1.15 per unit. As for energy charges, there is no hike for below poverty line (BPL) consumers and modest hike for domestic consumers.

MSEDCL has sharply reduced the fixed charges for small commercial establishments. Currently, it is Rs391 per month. For connections having load up to 20 KVA, it will now be Rs207 per month. However, it has been increased for loads more than this.

The variable charges for small commercial establishments has also been reduced for high consumption. At present for loads up to 20 KVA, the tariff is Rs6.10 per unit up to 200 units, and Rs9.25 per unit above that. Now, a flat tariff of Rs7.90 per unit has been proposed. There is a 2% increase for consumers having load between 20 KVA and 50 KVA and no increase for those having load more than 50 KVA.

As usual, industries will bear the brunt of MSEDCL’s tariff hikes. An increase of 10% has been proposed for high tension (HT) industrial consumers in Rs/KVA/month tariff. There is, however, negligible increase in variable charges.

The proposed hike for metered agricultural consumers is 5%. The tariff for public services (government institutions) having load up to 20 KVA is flat at Rs3.70 per unit while that for non-government institutions is Rs5.80 per unit. There is a hike of 4-6% for loads above this. The electrical vehicle charging stations’ tariff has been increased from Rs4.72 per unit to Rs5 per unit.

JAIPUR: State education minister Govind Singh Dotasra ’s email account was allegedly hacked and a mail was sent from it early on Wednesday. The minister took to Twitter to share this information and posted a screenshot of the sent mail. He asked the recipients of the mail to delete it.

In the tweet, the minister said, “Today morning at 3.50am, my email account was hacked and a mail was sent to everyone in my contact list. I would request everyone to delete the mail. A complaint in this regard has been lodged with cyber security department. Inconvenience is regretted.”

Dotasra also shared a screenshot of the sent mail but link for the same could not be opened when TOI tried to access it.

The complaint addressed to the cyber cops said that the email account was used by the minister for important government works and there are high chances that the unidentified accused can the account for causing harm because of which it is crucial that the accused be found. “It is a cause of concern that people are hacking accounts and we were advised to not open the email that was sent from my account as it might corrupt more data on the system. This is the reason I tweeted so people become aware of this. We changed the password so that the account can be used again. It is difficult to understand the purpose behind this hacking”, added the minister.

Cyber police confirming the incident said that they will serve a legal notice to Google so as to find the source from where the hacking was done and further investigation is underway

According to cyber experts, hacking accounts and creating fake accounts of dignitaries and further demanding money from their friends via message chats is one of the most common ways of online fraud. Experts said that the fraudsters use hit and trial method to target people as the mobile numbers and email ids of dignitaries are easily available on various platforms.

Colva: Tourism director Menino D’Souza said on Wednesday that the newly appointed beach cleaning agency Karnataka Commercial and Industrial Corporation (KCIC), will not be allotted a permanent transfer station to collect wet waste gathered from beach shacks in South Goa before sending it to the treatment plant.

“They have been allotted several spots to temporarily store the wet waste, which is collected from beach shacks from Cavelossim to Arossim, before sending it for treatment,” D’Souza said.

Waste is collected from 96 shacks allotted by the tourism department, besides private shacks.

A month ago, TOI had reported that children’s park at Colva had turned into a garbage transfer station. At the time, KCIC’s Goa head Parveen Farooqui had said that this was a temporary arrangement and that they were in the process of getting a transfer station from the tourism department. After this, she had said, they would shift the unit to Benaulim.

Justifying the temporary transfer stations, the authorities said that the wet waste that arrives at the transfer station is not unloaded on the ground. It is directly moved to a larger vehicle for transfer to the treatment plant.

Since the report, however, the agency had stopped using the children’s park, which fronts the iconic Colva beach, as a temporary transfer station. It now only keeps bins there. A hotelier in the vicinity on condition of anonymity said the entire area was stinking of decomposed food.

Asked what would happen once Colva beach is developed under the central scheme, the director said the transfer station would be moved as these are temporary measures.

AHMEDABAD: For Jay Parmar, 30, a resident of Asarwa, a trip to his brother’s residence to celebrate Uttarayan proved to be near-fatal when his throat was slit by a glass-laced manja coated thread on Tuesday. Parmar received 15 stitches as the front and side of his throat were cut.

He was among the 24 persons who were admitted to the Civil Hospital on the day of Uttarayan due to injuries caused by kite threads — either manja or nylon thread, popularly known as ‘Chinese manja.’

Dr M F Shaikh, head of the plastic surgery department at Civil Hospital, said the department received a total of 41 cases of Uttarayan-related injuries including 24 by kite threads. “Out of the total, 21 were superficial and three were deep. Among overall injured, 31 were males, nine children and one female,” he said. “Others sustained injuries due to fall from height.”

While LG Hospital recorded 35-odd cases of Uttarayan-related emergencies, Sola Civil Hospital received 12 cases, said senior hospital authorities.

JAIPUR: To facilitate smooth flow of traffic at the toll plazas in the national highways, FASTag norms for 65 toll plazas, including three in Rajasthan, with high cash transactions have been relaxed to allow them to convert up to 25 per cent of ""FASTag lane of fee plaza"" into hybrid lanes for 30 days, the Centre said in a statement on Wednesday.

With FASTag toll collection at 68.63% in Rajasthan, the number of vehicles (the ones that use national highways) with FASTag has touched 59.92% in the state. Among the three plazas in Rajasthan include Negadiya plaza in Udaipur, Gagal in Ajmer and Kishangarh in Jaipur. The move, a road ministry statement said, is temporary for 30 days and has been done on the request of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) so that the citizens are not put to any inconvenience. As per NHAI chairman SS Sandhu, Jodhpur toll plaza in Rajasthan has outperformed others in implementation of FASTags with around 91 per cent of toll collection taking place via FASTags.

Accused Sultan Padri in police custody on Wednesday

JAIPUR: City police have arrested the prime accused in the murder of a 75-year-old mother-in-law of a senior police officer.

She was brutally murdered by a gang of three masked and armed robbers at her Mansarovar residence in September 2018. The accused is said to be a member of the Padri gang. The elderly lady was thrashed by the three hardcore criminals when she resisted the robbery bid. Sharp injuries on her head and neck, along with profuse bleeding, had led to her death.

While cops had arrested five members of the gang previously, 23-year-old Sultan Padri was the kingpin and the main accused in the elderly woman’s murder.

Anand Shrivastav, Commissioner of Police, Jaipur, said, “Sultan had absconded after the murder and we had been looking for him since 2018. While other members of the Padri gang had been arrested, Sultan was the main accused and a team was constituted to trace him. A reward of Rs 25,000 was also announced on his arrest.”

Cops arrested Sultan from Madhya Pradesh’s Ratlam after receiving information about his location. He is also involved in robbery cases in Jhunjhunu district.

Three robbers, clad in underclothes and vests, attempted to rob two houses on the intervening nights of September 14-15, 2018, before finally breaking into the house of victim Pushpa Bisaria. The senior citizen lived in the house with her grandson while her son-in-law, additional SP (SOG) Sanjiv Bhatnagar, stayed next door. The victim’s ears and nose had sustained injuries after the robbers snatched her gold earrings and nose ring.

The gang had tied up her grandson Shaurya Vardhan Bisaria, whose parents live in Delhi, to a chair in his room. Shaurya has been living with his grandmother for the past four months, since the death of his grandfather. The incident came to light when Shaurya, who managed to free himself, informed Bhatnagar and his family.

BJP state president Sadanand Tanavade

MARGAO: BJP state president Sadanand Tanavade on Wednesday said the party would win both—Fatorda and Margao—assembly seats which are currently with the opposition in the 2022 assembly elections.

“We will definitely win Fatorda constituency. Margao too will be in our kitty, and we will start working towards that soon,” Tanavade told reporters during his first visit to the party’s South Goa office in Margao after taking over the reins of the party earlier this week.

Squashing speculations about Margao MLA Digambar Kamat joining BJP, Tanavade said, “It’s a misfortune of Congress that its president has no trust in his own MLA.” He was alluding to the recent statement by state Congress president Girish Chodankar to the effect that BJP was attempting to induct Kamat into the saffron party.

“This isn’t an issue in the party. There hasn’t been a discussion regarding any such thing in the party. We have 27 MLAs, we are safe and enjoy a comfortable majority; we don’t need to induct anybody,” Tanavade said.

Referring to Kamat’s ongoing door-to-door campaign, Tanavade said, “He has become insecure, and therefore he is going door-to-door. He is in confusion.”

He added that the party’s aim would be to come to power on its own strength with absolute majority in the 2022 polls. Asked about the party’s preparation for the zilla panchayat elections which are likely to be held in March, Tanavade said that while BJP would win the ZP polls, the party wouldn’t turn it into a “prestige” issue.

“Our aim is to win the 2022 assembly elections,” he said.

Replying to a query, Tanavade said a mechanism would soon be put in place to ensure that all ministers and officers interact with party workers at BJP offices.

NRI commissioner Narendra Sawaikar and BJP general secretary Damodar Naik were also present.

Bareilly: District magistrate (DM) Nitish Kumar has set up an inquiry in the matter of a woman, who was allegedly roughed up by police during Sampurn Samadhan Divas organised at Meerganj subdivision on Tuesday. The DM said he has asked the additional district magistrate (ADM) V K Singh to investigate the police role in the matter and report to him.

On Tuesday, one Soni Devi had reportedly created a ruckus at the hall. She subsequently got injured after being dragged outside by cops. According to officials, she had repeatedly made false complaints in the past, and had again reached the tehsil hall on Tuesday with a complaint.

However, Devi alleged that a lekhpal was demanding bribe for measuring the piece of land allotted to her by district administration. The drama over her manhandling continued for half an hour and was videographed by people who had gathered there on cell phones, which later went viral.

While reacting to the incident, the DM on Wednesday said, “I’d heard that this woman has created nuisance on several occasions before even taking charge in the district. My predecessor had to call up police to control her when she had once created a ruckus at the collectorate. I’ve asked the ADM (executive) to examine the matter and report to me.”

The DM said Devi was allotted a small piece of land for few years. After the lease period expired, she was allotted two more land parcels, bigger in size, in the same village.

According to sources in the administration, years ago, plots of around 2.5 bigha size were allotted for 5 years to eligible SC people. Devi had got a plot then. After the lease expired, a fresh allotment took place.

“This time, Devi was allotted 6 bighas, for good, as well as another one acre plot for tree plantation near the river. We learnt she now wants that 2.5 bigha plot too, whose lease has expired,” DM said.

On asking why her nose was bleeding after the police action, the DM said, “It was a minor accident. Senior officers were present there and she was immediately provided first aid.”

Prakash Bora is the descendant of Dungar Singh, who helped Jim Corbett hunt the man-eater of Champawat

PITHORAGARH: A resident of Gaudi village in Champawat district of Kumaon, Prakash Bora, has claimed to have found a ‘ khukri ’ (carved knife) and sword given by famous hunter and environmentalist Jim Corbett to his ancestor Dungar Singh who had helped Corbett pin down the location of a fearsome man-eater tigress on the Champawat-Gaudi road in 1907. Corbett also mentioned Dungar Singh in his book ‘Man-eaters of Kumaon’ in which he described the hunt for the tigress who had killed an estimated 436 people in the region. This was apparently the first man-eater killed by Corbett. The ‘khukri’ and sword were discovered by Bora’s family last week in the godown of their home.

Taking note of the villager’s claims, the Champawat district administration said that they will have the ‘khukri’ and sword examined and also carbon-dated, if possible, to determine their antiquity. “If it is indeed found to have a Corbett connection, we will highlight this in the Corbett circuit of Kumaon being planned for tourists,” said a district official.

Speaking to TOI, Bora said that his ancestor, Dungar Singh died almost 30 years ago. “Occasionally, some people, mostly tourists, used to come to our house asking about him and his association with Corbett since they had read his name being mentioned by Corbett in his book. They also used to ask us if Corbett had given anything to him for his help in tracking the man-eater since the hunter was known to gift things to his associates,” Bora said.

Although the family knew that Dungar Singh had been given a ‘khukri’ and sword by Corbett, they were not sure where these items were kept. However, last week, both the items were discovered in a godown under a pile of wood. “We have informed government officials regarding the find,” Bora said.

Lata Bisht, district tourism officer, Champawat, told TOI that the items can be a big attraction for tourists in the region. “We are planning to develop a ‘Corbett circuit’ in Champawat and have identified four places where he tracked and subsequently killed the man-eater tigress of Champawat. These items can add to the things that tourists can see,” Bisht said.

PUNE: The Maharashtra government plans to replicate the Kochi model to pull down the illegal structures by roping in demolition expert S B Sarwate, a senior official in the urban development department said on Wednesday.The official told TOI that talks were on both at the local- and state-level to use Sarwate’s expertise to demolish the structures through controlled implosion (see box), for which the administrative nod is in place.The Kerala government had roped in Sarwate (70), a mining engineer and demolition expert from Indore holding the Guinness world record for imploding the maximum number of buildings in India, to help it guide the demolition of the Maradu apartments in Kochi. The Supreme Court had ordered the demolition of the apartment buildings — Jains Coral Cove, H2O Holy Faith, Golden Kayaloram and the twin towers of Alfa Serene — as they violated the Coastal Regulation Zone norms and were located dangerously close to the Vembanad Lake.“The demolition was done without any damage to any nearby structure. It was a humungous task, as it required a lot of follow-ups and there were five buildings,” Kochi sub-collector S Snehil Kumar Singh told TOI.Sarwate told TOI over phone that the Kochi demolition method could be used to bring down huge illegal structures in Maharashtra too. “The demolition in Kochi required over 400kg of explosives.

332,['16/01/2020'],Nirbhaya case convicts unlikely to hang on Jan 22,"This story is from January 16, 2020

NEW DELHI: The scheduled hanging of the four Nirbhaya convicts on January 22 is set to be postponed, with the AAP government on Wednesday informing the high court that state’s jail rules make it mandatory they await outcome of a mercy plea filed by a death row convict.

The government told a bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal that the date fixed by the trial court for executing the convicts is now only “academic” as the rules further specify that 14 days’ time must be given to the condemned man to “make peace with God” once the President rejects mercy petition and all remedies under law are exhausted.

All four convicts — Mukesh, Vinay, Akshay and Pawan — are currently on death row after a trial court issued the black warrant on January 7, fixing 7 am of January 22 to execute them.

Opposing Mukesh’s plea that HC stay his impending execution, the prison authorities submitted the petition is “premature” since the jail manual prohibits carrying out capital punishment awarded to more than one person in a case, even if only one of them moves a mercy plea. Hanging can be done only once the mercy plea of all convicts in the case is decided, standing counsel Rahul Mehra told the bench.

“Then your rule is bad if you cannot take action till all the co-convicts have moved a mercy plea. It seems there has been non-application of mind (while framing the rules). Every mercy plea is on different grounds, you can’t allow them to frustrate the judicial finding which has attained finality,” an irked bench responded. Only Mukesh has moved a plea seeking mercy before the President. It, however, refused to tinker with the January 7 order and said it was without any error, declining the prayer of Mukesh that the death warrant should be set aside as being un-executable as he has moved a mercy plea before the President.

The HC pointed out that there is no error in the trial court’s decision as on that date, none of the convicts had moved a curative petition or a mercy plea. It left it to Mukesh’s counsel, senior advocate Rebecca John and advocate Vrinda Grover , to approach the trial court if he wants the date of execution to be set aside based on a subsequent event — moving of the mercy plea. The HC took a dim view that despite the Supreme Court dismissing Mukesh’s appeal, review and curative petition and confirming death sentence, his lawyers moved the high court against a death warrant that is only taking the SC’s ruling to a logical end.

Taking a cue from HC’s observations, the lawyers didn’t press the plea and instead approached the trial court on Wednesday evening. The hearing also saw the HC tick off the jail administration and the Delhi government for delay on their part. The bench highlighted that even though the SC’s final verdict came on May 5, 2017, the jail authorities acted a year later in October, when they informed Mukesh he has seven days time to file a mercy plea.

“Put your house in order. It is in disarray. The problem is people will lose confidence in the system. Things are not moving in the right direction. The system is capable of being exploited and we see a stratagem to exploit the system, which is oblivious about it,” the court observed.

Mehra agreed that the system was being exploited by the convicts to “frustrate” and “defeat” the process of law but hinted that delay happened at the end of the court too when it came to issuing the death warrant. He said the rules say if by noon of January 21, no decision is taken on the mercy plea, the prison administration will have to move the sessions court for a fresh death warrant.

National award-winning actor Vikram Gokhale

PUNE: National award-winning actor Vikram Gokhale on Wednesday said he supported the Prime Minister for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The veteran actor interacted with reporters during the Pune International Film Festival (PIFF). The festival honoured him last week with a Distinguished Award for his work in film, television and theatre.

“I am pro-CAA. I support (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi on this issue. All infiltrators, who are exploiting the taxes paid by the people of India, are being encouraged and provoked by the Leftists,” Gokhale said during the interaction.

Gokhale’s answers to the press were no-holds barred. “I have read Vinayak Damodar Savarkar’s works, his books. People, who haven’t read Savarkar’s works or understood it will not understand him ever. People criticize Savarkar for apologizing to the British, but he did that to come out of prison and aid in the Independence movement. What is the need to consider people like Savarkar and Mahatma Gandhi as gods? They were humans and they had their flaws,” he said, in response to a question.

While speaking about the release of a book that dubbed Modi as a modern day Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, as well as the NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s comments on Ramdas Swami and his role in the rise of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, he said, “I didn’t hear what Pawar said. I consider him to be one of the few visionaries within the NCP, as well as in Indian politics. The book wasn’t the right move. I don’t know who wrote the book, but he should have had better sense. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj cannot be compared with anyone,” he said.

The festival this year was dedicated to the actor and thespian Shreeram Lagoo, who passed away in December 2019. In a chat with festival director Jabbar Patel, who has also been his colleague, Gokhale spoke of Lagoo as a mentor, colleague and friend.

“He saw me performing on stage once. He mentioned it to Shantabai Jog (senior actor) that I wasn’t simply “acting”, but I was natural and spontaneous. That was one of the biggest compliments I have ever received,” he reminisced, adding that a list of the greatest ever actors would be incomplete without Lagoo’s name.

Toughest role

“I would say that over all of the roles I have played on stage, film, or television, the toughest role I have ever played is in the play Barrister, by Jaywant Dalvi. The role I played was very tough and complex. I also liked the role I played in Jabbar Patel’s Mukta, which also had actors like Dr Lagoo himself, as well as Reema Lagoo and Sonali Kulkarni.”

PUNE: Most schools in the city have completed teaching the Class X syllabus but have an additional task ahead.

Schools have planned more than one set of prelims and remedial classes for the next two months. Special sessions to counsel parents of the Class X students are underway as are ways to familiarize students to take the examinations with a clear head and patience,

Principals said they were worried about the decreasing ability of students to sit for three-hour examinations and the impatience while attempting English and social studies papers.

Principal Teresa David of Laxmanrao Apte Prashala and Junior College affiliated to Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education said, “Over the years, we have noticed our students losing patience to take three-hour examinations. It is worse while they are attempting subjective papers like language and social studies.”

The fear of mathematics remains. “We are organizing special classes for mathematics and we are counselling parents to ensure that students attend them,” she added.

Principal C V Madhavi of DAV school (affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education) also spoke about the growing restlessness among students.

“We would be conducting three prelims to familiarize our students with the setting of the board examination. Besides, we would be having a one-to-one session with their parents,” she said.

The school started extra classes in August.“We identified students who were weak in some subjects and topics where they scored less and followed it up with extra classes,” Madhavi said.

Sujata Mallick Kumar, principal of St Mary's School spoke about extreme competitiveness among parents as one of the reasons for making board examinations a bogey for their wards. “We are counselling students regularly,” she said.

Mallick said they were also inculcating time management skills in students. “ Restlessness among the younger generation is evident and we are doing everything to address it,” she added.

Tomorrow it may be the minority status which may be threatened. Catholics should be vigilant. BJP says you require a strong leadership. Strong leadership means removal of minority status. This is their hidden agenda which could prove costly for Goans. Goa’s asmitai is actually a shield against all these divisive elements and divisive laws.

A satyagrahi will have to stand alone, says Tushar

ALWAR: BJP is misusing the words of Bapu for its public awareness campaign on Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ), alleged Mahatma Gandhi’s great-grandson Tushar Gandhi on Wednesday

“CAA is the most dangerous law of independent India and the first which attempts to divide the country. This law is contrary to the Constitution,” he said, calling on the youth to come forward in the fight against CAA. Tushar was speaking at the headquarters of the NGO Tarun Bharat Sangh at Bhimakpura, headed by water man and Magsaysay award winner Dr Rajendra Singh.

Tushar was speaking at the headquarters of the NGO Tarun Bharat Sangh at Bhimakpura after honouring 150 people working in the field of environment on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma.

How can those who killed Gandhji understand him, he asked, attacking the Centre and alleging that BJP was misusing Gandhi's name.

""After Partition, Gandhiji had said that if any person was suffering in Pakistan, whether Muslim or from other religion, they too can come to India. But BJP has been using these words selectively and dividing the country,"" he said.

Speaking to journalists, Tushar said that after the enactment of this law, the nation itself has no meaning. ""Nation does not consist of just land mass. There should be unity, equality and justice in the nation. But the way the NDA government is functioning, there is danger on all three counts,"" he said.

He advised citizens to adopt satyagraha and devise a systematic resistance movement. ""A satyagrahi will have to stand alone; his inspiration can be anyone. The nation which Mahatma Gandhi had envisioned has to be saved,"" he said.

Arun Gandhi, grandson of Gandhi, said the atmosphere prevailing in the country was worrisome and hoped that it would return to the old soon.

On the question of the ongoing protests to save the Constitution, he said that if Gandhi was alive, he would have been a worried man. ""He would have been concerned about the current situation,"" he said, adding that Indian polity was going through a stage similar to the one under British rule.

“The country will have to be saved. Bapu had the dream of equal economic development for everyone. But now the poor are becoming poorer and the rich becoming richer,” he said.

JAIPUR: Power supply to major parts of the city snapped on Wednesday after Chinese ‘manjha’ played havoc with the power distribution system.

Sources in Jaipur discom said power supply from the 220kV Nala power house was disrupted, resulting in power outage and preventing supply of power from feeders to major parts of the city in the afternoon.

The old city and neighbouring areas were the most affected.

Supply from the power house was hit at about 2.40pm for about 90 minutes, the time which the agency took to restore supply from Nala, said an official.

All feeders from the power house were affected. Some feeders were supplied power from alternative sources. In some places, local disturbances also resulted in supply disruption.

Most of the disruptions occurred due to Chinese ‘manjha’, which have metallic and plastic coating, that got entangled in power lines, resulting in short circuits and supply failure.

Incidentally, the Chinese ‘manjha’ has been banned in the state. But the administration failed to enforce the ban effectively.

Bombay high court

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday gave the state government two weeks to prepare and submit brief documents identifying wetlands in Maharashtra.

“Complete the job,” said a bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Burgess Colabawalla, which did not accede to a request by Anil Digikar, principal secretary, environment department, to allow a month’s time to complete the task.

The court heard a public interest litigation filed in 2013 by NGO Vanshakti to preserve wetlands and was miffed that despite the high court’s earlier orders and even reminders by Digikar to district collectors and divisional commissioners, there was no progress.

The judges asked Digikar what action he proposed against erring officials. “They are not bothered about the court’s orders or your directions...And if you take it lightly, they will not obey you,” said Justice Kathawalla. Digikar told the court that he had informed chief secretary Ajay Mehta, who, in turn, has directed all district collectors to finish the work of preparing the brief documents of wetlands as soon as possible.

But when Digikar asked for month’s time, the bench said it must be completed within 15 days.

The brief document provides characteristics and features of a particular wetland . Wetlands include marshy areas, estuaries, creeks, tanks, ponds, reservoirs, lakes and other water bodies.

Government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade submitted the state’s affidavit in which it has stated that other than Nagpur and Parbhani, even Nandurbar has no wetlands.

The NGO’s advocate Zaman Ali countered it is incorrect that these three places have no wetlands.

Ali said the national wetland atlas of Maharashtra shows Nagpur has 1,054 wetlands, Parbhani has 276 and Nandurkar 735, respectively. He said the national wetland atlas of Maharashtra was prepared by the State Application Centre, which is at Ahmedabad in Gujarat and is the research wing of the Indian Space Research Organisation.

The bench sought the information to be given in writing and posted the next hearing to January 29 for an update.

Nita Kanwar moved to Jodhpur from Pakistan's Sindh province in 2001

JAIPUR: In November 2001, she had migrated to Jodhpur from Sindh in Pakistan nurturing hopes for a better education and finding a perfect match. Eighteen years later, educated and confident, Nita Kanwar (36) received her Indian citizenship in September 2019.

And now, she will contest for the post of sarpanch in the local elections, to be held on January 17, from Natwara gram panchayat in Tonk district.

This has come at a time when there have been widespread protests across the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

Nita’s father-in-law Thakur Laxman Karan, who has been sarpanch thrice in Natwara, is her inspiration and guiding her to contest the panchayat polls from the village. Karan was also the district Youth Congress president earlier.

“I was granted citizenship at the Tonk collector office in September last year. It took me at least three years to complete the process of citizenship. My father-in-law is guiding me in the panchayat election,” said Nita, who has a daughter and son.

Nita and her elder sister Anjana Sodha (who also got Indian citizenship) migrated from Sindh’s Mirpur-Khas 19 years back.

She completed her BA degree from the Sophia College, Ajmer, in 2005, and later got married to Punya Pratap Singh, who runs a travel firm in Tonk, in 2011. Her sister also got married and settled in Jodhpur.

Since Sindh is pre-dominated by Rajput Sodhas, who cannot marry another Sodha as per tradition, the sisters had decided to migrate to Jodhpur to find a match from the Rajput community here. “Initially, I stayed with my aunt in Jodhpur before moving to Ajmer for graduation. Till Class XII, I had studied in Sindh,"" she added.

“I am contesting from a general seat, which is reserved for women. I want to work towards promoting gender equality, women’s empowerment, providing good education and proper medical facilities for the girl child and helping them find employment. I am getting a lot of support from my family members and villagers,” Nita told TOI.

While Nita’s father Swaroop Singh and brother Rajawant Singh Sodha still live in the Sindh province and continue doing agriculture, her mother Mohan Kanwar lives in Jodhpur.

But for kitists, a lot depends on Uttarayan and Vasi Uttarayan, constantly changing wind speeds and direction. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the wind direction constantly changed and at times there was no wind, leaving kitists disappointed. Only in the evenings did many get to enjoy the festivities.

Akash Solanki, a resident of Jivraj Park, said: “Flying kites is my favourite part of the festival and even though the winds were fluctuating from morning till afternoon, I stayed put on the terrace.” Solanki went on to say: “It was tiring but fun. But come evening, the spirits were instantly up as the wind was good.”

The wind does not matter, said Kushal Dani, a 23-year-old resident of Vejalpur. “ I love flying kites and try to ensure that I make the most of the festival,” Dani said. “This is the only day when I meet family and friends and spend the day on the terrace.”

Others, however, chose not to work too hard trying to fly kites and decided to gorge on festive delicacies. “Generally, we get to the terrace as early as 8am but because the wind was weak in the morning, there was no point going to the terrace,” said Shreyanshi Shah, a resident of Paldi. “Thus, we decided to devour scrumptious Uttarayan food.”

“We went to a friend’s place in the pol but the winds were a disappointment in the morning. The arms got a good exercise. But the evening was fun as we not only flew kites but also tukkals once it got dark.” Tasmay Dholakia, Satellite resident

PUNE: Three attendants of a petrol pump in Pune Camp and their handler were arrested on Tuesday for installing skimming sensors on debit/credit card readers and using the data to siphon off money from the accounts of the card holders.

The cyber crime branch of the Pune police, who made the arrests, said the loss to customers may run into lakhs of rupees.

The crime involves skimming of card details, noting down PIN numbers and selling the data to two Delhi-based men who cloned the cards and swiped them to transfer money into their accounts.

A team headed by assistant commissioner of police (crime) Shivaji Pawar and police inspector Jayram Paygude arrested Mithun Ali, Noel Shaikh, Saimuddin Ali and Zulfikar Ahmed, all residents of Malda in West Bengal, after receiving as many as 60 complaints of the same nature in the last two weeks.

Seven cellphones, 20 fake debit cards, 12 original debit cards, ID cards, Aadhaar cards and Rs 1,230 in cash have been recovered from them.

Citizens had complained that their cards were used to withdraw money from their bank accounts without their knowledge. The investigating team found that all the complainants had used their cards at the same petrol pump. They then focused their investigation on the attendants employed at the fuel station.

They found that Mithun, Noel, and Saimuddin had started working at the petrol pump three months ago and were from the same village. All three used a skimming machine to steal data from the cards that customers used at their petrol pump to pay for the fuel, the police said.

The three would peek into the machine while customers were keying in the PIN and note it down. They would sell the data to Zulfikar, who in turn, sold it to two Delhi-based men who paid all four between Rs 20,000 and Rs 30,000.

The Delhi duo would make duplicate cards and transfer the money to their own accounts, the police added.

Ahmedabad: A 15-year-old boy from Dahod, who had come to the city a montha go to earn a livelihood by ragpicking, was crushed by a truck contracted by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) when he was picking rags at the Pirana dump on Wednesday.

A complaint filed with K division traffic police said that the incident occurred at around 7.30am on Wednesday.

Police said that they have seized the truck and driver is still absconding.

According to the FIR, “He was picking through the waste with his elder brother, uncle and aunt. A garbage truck, going in reverse, crushed him.”

The deceased’s uncle said, “His parents were not able to properly feed the four-member family at Jhalod in Dahod district, as they are farm labourers. They recently sent their son to rag pick so he could make some money. For around a month, he was working with me at the Pirana dump yard.”

The investigating officer, sub-inspector of K division traffic police, B B Vaghela, said they have questioned the contractor about the driver’s whereabouts. “It seems that the truck driver did not see the boy, who was carrying a large plastic bag to put whatever he salvaged in plastic, and reversed the truck. The right rear wheel crushed him,” said Vaghela.

Police have registered a complaint of negligent driving causing death and began an investigation into the case.

Earlier, a 15-year youth from Dahod had come to Ahmedabad and worked at Pirana for three months to pay his fees. There are 1,000-odd labourers working at the top of the Pirana mound, salvaging things to be recycled or reused. Most make between Rs 10,000 and Rs 12,000 a month. Some are here with their families, including little children.

This business activity at Pirana is, however, illegal. Only 60 women have been authorized by SEWA, an NGO, to salvage plastic or paper from teh garbage. With corporation officials refusing to speak about this business at Pirana, there has been a long-standing turf war between SEWA women and other ragpickers.

Officials said that most rag-pickers know about dumptruck movements, but this 15-year may not have been aware ran behind it as it reached the top to empty its load.

Immediately after Goplani posted his comment on social media against the CAA as well as the National Register for Citizens (NRC), the detection of crime branch (DCB) Vadodara issued him and another person a notice. He was asked to give explanation for the post which the cops claimed was intended at spreading enmity among communities.

Goplani, chairman of Minority Development And Protection Foundation, reportedly deleted his post after he felt it was perceived by the administration as one creating rift among communities.

After the CDB, Vadodara filed an FIR against Goplani, and he unsuccessfully approached a sessions court in Vadodara.

Later, he moved the high court seeking anticipatory bail.

The state government took time to reply to the court’s notice. Hence, the HC has posted hearing on the anticipatory bail plea on January 30 and directed police not to arrest him till then.

THRISSUR: The move to migrate entirely to FASTag system of toll collection became a flop at Paliakkara toll plaza on the opening day on Wednesday because of the unprecedented crowding of vehicles on the national highway stretch between Kuttanellur and Amballur.

The toll plaza authorities had to convert six counters to cash payment system by afternoon following traffic block.

According to police, about 50,000 vehicles pass through the toll plaza everyday and more than half of them were yet to change over to the FASTag system even though the decision was announced much earlier.

Many vehicles were opting for cash payment, but the toll plaza authorities had made arrangements to introduce the FASTag system in 10 of the 12 counters from Wednesday.

Police had warned the toll plaza authorities that they would also be held responsible if ambulances and emergency vehicles are not able to move freely because of the traffic block. The queue of vehicles had extended on either side to nearly 3 kms choking the traffic on the main road itself.

The situation became very tense by afternoon as the drivers and passengers started questioning the toll plaza staff.

Even though acute traffic blocks were reportedly witnessed in several other toll plazas across the country, the situation at Paliakkara was worse as local residents were agitated that the toll waiver concession enjoyed by them would be stopped.

Congress district vice-president Joseph Tajet alleged that it was the indifference of the state government that had led to the crisis. He said the government has not taken steps to pay the toll on behalf of local residents, violating the assurance given earlier.

However, the education minister C Raveendranath said smartcard holders in the area will continue to enjoy the toll waiver. But he conceded discussions will have to be held about those vehicle owners whose smart cards have expired.

Kochi: The high court on Wednesday ordered state police chief to direct station house officers (SHOs) to directly register cases against those violating the ban on illegal flex boards, banners, and flags.

Justice Devan Ramachandran issued the order after noticing that the earlier direction to the secretaries of local self-government institutions to report violations to the police has not been effective in dealing with the menace.

As the mechanism put in place is ineffective, the state police chief should issue necessary instructions to all SHOs to ensure that the court’s order on the ban is implemented in letter and spirit, including registration of cases against violators and also the officials who failed to take timely action, the interim order said. “The state police chief will issue such circular to all the station house officers asking them to invoke necessary provisions of the Road Safety Act, the Indian Penal Code and such other applicable penal provisions, including for violation of the orders of this court; and this shall be done not later than four days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order,” the court ordered.

Through the circular, the state police chief should require all the SHOs to be personally responsible for removal of all unauthorized boards, banners, flags, and such other offensive materials and against all the culprits under the fullest warrant of law and that they are prosecuted, the court directed.

Further, the court asked the government to give wide publicity to the circular by publication in prominent newspapers.

MYSURU: More than four-decade-old district Jawahar Bal Bhavan , which used to attract hundreds of children, is currently not only in a pathetic condition, but has also become a den for anti-social activities.

Jawahar Bal Bhavan, which is spread over 13 acres and located opposite to Torchlight Parade Ground in Bannimantap, is maintained by Mysuru Urban Development Authority. Two years ago, the authority took up renovation work at an estimated cost of Rs 4.12 crore but little work has been done on the ground. Due to lack of maintenance, it has become a place for anti-social activities, the residents said.

Earlier, classes for drawing, painting, clay modelling, drama, craft work and dance were conducted for school children during the week-end.

Apart from this, the Bal Bhavan, which was opened in 1979, was also famous for running toy train, art gallery and film screening. Due to quality training and right ambience, children used to attend in large in numbers.

Cut to present: All these activities have been completely stopped.

MUDA, which owns the property, had given 30 years lease to Bal Bhavan Society that lapsed in 2007. Since then, though the Bal Bhavan Society is interested in continuing with it, it is yet to get renewed by MUDA authorities, sources said.

After the criticism, the authority chalked out a plan to upgrade it by adding new attractions. The facilities planned were swimming pool, waterfalls, park and modern amusement games along with facilities to educate children. Development work to the tune of Rs 4.12 crore was initiated and taken up in October 2014. On the ground, after constructing canteen, stage and multipurpose hall, the work has come to a standstill since mid-2015. The constructed buildings too are getting spoiled, putting Bal Bhavan in shambles.

The employees who work there are also in a piquant situation as they are paid just Rs 5,000 even after working for more than 25 years. There are five employees working in Bal Bhavan including the manager, who is working for more than 35 years and getting Rs 7,000. The other staff members who are working for more than 25 to 30 years are paid Rs 5,000 per month.

K Jyothi, CEO Of Zilla Panchayat, assured to bring it to the notice of district minister V Somanna and do her best to both Bal Bhavan and the employees.

Will do best to revive it, says chairperson

Chikkamma Basavaraj from Mysuru, who took charge as chairperson, Bal Bhavan Society, Karnataka, recently assured to do her best to revive district Jawahar Bal Bhavan. “I took charge a few days ago and will definitely pay a visit to Bal Bhavan and take stock of the situation at the earliest. Will also see and look into employee’s issues who are paid a meagre salary,” he said.

Aditya Birla Memorial Hospital

PUNE: Chinchwad-based Aditya Birla Memorial Hospital (ABMH) has invested Rs 45 crore to upgrade the healthcare facility from tertiary to quaternary.

“A majority (about 80%) of the investment has gone into equipment upgrade that will enable the hospital to use artificial intelligence, robotics and assist terminally ill patients. The investment is about 6-8 times the usual investment that the hospital undertakes on upgrades every year,” Rekha Dubey, chief executive officer of ABMH, said.

The hospital is designing a new paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with child-friendly designs and play area elements embedded in the unit, giving a separate entrance to those coming for deliveries (which is a happy occasion), and opening up the gym and wellness centre even to outsiders for preventive care.

“It was not easy in the beginning when we started in 2006. It was too huge for a hospital and all our doctors were not a very known name then. People preferred to go to the doctors they knew,” Dubey said, adding, “Over time, the hospital has managed to retain all its doctors and they are very much known among people, at large.”

She said it had an in-house team of 115 full-time consultants, who do not go to any other hospital. Only 2-3% of its doctors are visiting doctors, which means most of the doctors are available for a longer period in the hospital.

The corporate hospital, she added, is not bound by government regulations as it takes no government aid and is a part of Aditya Birla Health Services. “There is a perception that the services are too costly but on a comparable basis, it is not costly for the kind of cutting edge technology that the hospital uses,” she said.

Aurangabad: The special railway court at Aurangabad discharged a suspect arrested in a theft case after the investigating officer admitted that the man was in their custody at the time of theft.

Police sub-inspector Mahadev Gopal Kasbe of the railway protection force (RPF) made the confession while evidence was being recorded during his cross-examination before the judicial magistrate first class (railways) P H Joshi.

According to the RPF, a team of led by Kasbe nabbed Gautam Bhimrao Kirtane at around 5.45am on March 21, 2012, when he was spotted moving around suspiciously at the Parbhani railway yard. Police team claimed to have found stolen railway cable on him. The RPF team then recorded the suspect’s confessional statement and produced him in court the same day.

Contesting on behalf of Kirtane, lawyer Akshay Radikar cited police station records that showed that his client was handed over to RPP by Parbhani local crime branch on March 20, 2012 at 2 pm. Records with the RPF police station corroborated that lawyer’s claims.

During cross-examination, Kasbe admitted that the suspect was in the custody of the RPF when the theft was alleged to have been committed.

Taking serious congizance of the development, the court observed ‘It is seen that the accused was in custody of the complainant himself at the time of incident which falsifies the case of complainant.’ The court went on to state that ‘no prima facie case is made out against the accused and there is no sufficient material to proceed against the accused.’

Kasbe further admitted that the accused was produced on next day in the court and also stated that the accused had no opportunity to commit the alleged offence between March 12, 2012 till 6 am of March 21, 2012.

Railway court went on to observe that ‘It is seen that the accused was in custody of the complainant himself from March 20, 2012 till 6am of March 21, 2012. Thus, the said material fact creates serious doubt regarding the allegations of commission of offence by the accused on 21.3.2012 at 5.45 am. Further facts testified in cross-examination is also contrary to the facts deposition that on March 21, 2012, the accused was found in suspicious manner at 5.45 am at Parbhani railway station.’

In recent past, maximum number of injuries witnessed in a single day was this year

NAGPUR: The kite festival of Makar Sankranti turned out to be a bloody affair in the city on Wednesday with five people and dozens of birds and animals sustaining serious injuries from the manja. In recent years, these are the maximum number of injuries the city has witnessed in a single day.

32-year-old Satyendra Tiwari, who works as an assistant manager in a bank, suffered perilous injuries on the right side of his neck and left hand fingers. The accident took place around 9.30am at Manewada Square when Tiwari, a resident of Narendra Nagar, was on his way to the bank.

Tiwari was driving a two-wheeler when a stray manja inflicted a cut on his throat. According to his wife Rucha, he started bleeding profusely and passers-by rushed him to a nearby hospital.

Later, Tiwari was shifted to Orange City Hospital and Research Institute (OCHRI) where he was immediately rushed to the operation theatre for surgery. “He underwent neck exploration and wound reconstruction of neck along with repair of his left thumb and fingers. He had a close call and is now under observation in the ICU,” said hospital director Dr Anup Marar.

In the second mishap, media photographer Jasprit Tuteja’s lips and tongue got deeply cut from a manja. Driving a two-wheeler, Jasprit’s face was fully covered with a cloth when the accident took place at Mecosabagh flyover.

“The manja was so sharp that it tore the cloth and injured both sides of his lips. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he received around eight stitches,” informed his family members who suspect that the injury could have been caused by the banned nylon manja.

TOI has been repeatedly reporting that despite multiple bans, nylon manja continues to be sold discreetly in the city.

Fireman Makarand Satpute was the third victim of the deadly thread. Around 9.30am, he was on his way to office when his neck suddenly got entangled in a stray manja at Sanjay Gandhi Nagar. “It came right in front of me out of nowhere and I immediately stopped my two-wheeler. I received a cut in the middle of my neck but thankfully it was not very deep,” said Satpute, who too stated that manja must have been the banned nylon.

It is also learnt that contractor Ramzan Sheikh’s neck got slit by a manja while he was on his two-wheeler near Mahal.

In the fifth case, Adnan Ali, who hails from Chhindwara and is studying BCCA at Ambedkar College, sustained neck injuries near Shatabdi Chowk while he was on his bike.

Apart from humans, several animals and birds too came under the deathly trap of the killer thread. Founder director of Wild-CER Dr Bahar Baviskar, who has set-up a special critical care unit for injured birds at Friends Colony, informed that more than 10 cases of bird injuries from manja have come up till now. “We have been treating barn owl, koyal and other species. Birds get easily entangled in manja which cuts away their feathers or other parts,” he said.

Smita Mire, founder of Save Speechless Organisation (SSO), informed that a cow sustained injuries after its neck got completely entangled in a manja hanging from a tree. “The legs of two dogs got severely cut from manja. Also, we spotted few dead birds,” she said.

Five injured birds were rescued through the ‘Mood of the Group — Safe Birds’ group so far.

As per available records, in 2012 three citizens sustained severe injuries and in 2011 manja claimed 4 lives including that of 2 children.

Bagalkot/Belagavi/Shivamogga/Haveri: On a day when he was roundly criticised for openly seeking cabinet berths for members of the Lingayat community, Panchamasali Mutt seer Vachanananda Swami, on Wednesday, apologised.

“I did not mean to hurt anyone. Please treat me as your child and forgive me,” the seer said, seeking to put a lid on the controversy. His apology came hours after BJP MLA and community leader Basanagouda Patil Yatnal and some religious heads denounced his conduct and backed Yediyurappa.

The seer was involved in a spat with chief minister BS Yediyurappa at a public function on Tuesday in Davanagere when he demanded cabinet berths for Lingayat leaders and warned that the community would withdraw its support to the CM if he did not acquiesce. An incensed Yediyurappa responded by berating the seer and threatening to quit the function.

Yatnal criticized the seer saying: “Religious leaders should not interfere in political matters, that too in public, or blackmail a chief minister. Yediyurappa is not the chief minister of the Lingayat community alone. He represents all communities in the state. The seer’s conduct is unbecoming of a religious leader.”

Prominent Panchamasali mutt seer, Basava Jaya Mrityujaya dubbed Vachanananda’s warning “an insult to the entire community”.

“There is nothing wrong in suggesting names or requesting the CM to appoint community leaders to the cabinet,” Mrityujaya said. “Even I have requested the CM to include at least three Panchamasali Lingayat leaders to the cabinet including Nirani and Yatnal. But you cannot dictate terms. Our community is solidly behind Yediyurappa.”

Endorsing Yediyurappa's stand against the Lingayat seer, former KPCC president and legislator Dinesh Gundurao said religious leaders of any community should not threaten a chief minister on political matters. Channamalla Veerabhadra Swami, the pontiff of Nidumamidi Mahasamsthana Mutt and Dingaleshwar Swami, the pontiff of Balehosuru Dingaleshwar Mutt also extended support to Yediyurappa.

KOCHI: The city and its suburbs have been facing severe shortage in supply of drinking water due to the delay in setting up more hydrant points at the Kerala Water Authority’s (KWA) plants at Maradu and Aluva. As the tanker trucks supplying drinking water too have come under the scanner over the quality of water they supply, residents are struggling to get enough potable water.Somanathan VS, secretary, Kerala Apartment Owners’ Apex Association (KAOAA) said: “For the past two days, several apartments have been hardly getting any water supply. The district administration should act on a war footing and come up with solutions.”Residents say tanker truck operators have been demanding increased rates and insisting on passing vehicle tax to consumers. They want the amount paid to the drivers to be passed on to the consumers. VK Shankarankutty, president, KAOAA, said: “The tanker trucks do not want to register with the district administration. They are bargaining by denying water supply to the public.” According to the apartment owners’ association, the tankers have increased the rates for truck with 6,000 litres capacity from Rs 750 to Rs 2,000. “The truckers say that they have to wait in queue for long hours to connect with the hydrant point,” added Somanathan.Chandrika Devi, chairperson, Tripunithura Municipality, said the local body has raised the issue with the district collector. It’s not just apartment complexes that have been hit by water shortage. Even individual houses and commercial complexes face a similar issue.Regions like Mekkara, Chathari, Eroor and Irumpanam are the worst affected due to the shortage in water supply.“One of the reason for the shortage is that pumping force has come down due to frequent power disruption. Damaged pipes can also be a reason. Water should be pumped forcefully, only then will these regions get enough supply,” said Devi.Meanwhile, the district collector has taken measures to temporarily address the crisis in the city and suburbs. Large-scale consumers like hospitals, apartment complexes and residents’ associations, who face shortage of drinking water supply, can submit applications to the collector. The district administration will verify the veracity of the claim and make immediate measures to supply water to the affected people.KWA officials said vending facilities are limited at Aluva and Maradu and more tankers are coming to the treatment plant at Aluva. As the number of vehicles increase, it will take a long time for the vehicles to fill water. “If there are more hydrant points, it may bring down pressure and cause delay in filling the trucks.

NAGPUR: Sadar police on Wednesday detained a woman lab assistant at the Government Polytechnic (GP) college, Sadar, for around three hours, after she allegedly threw liquid ammonia on the head of the department (HOD) of IT department. The presence of mind of the HOD saved her, as when the liquid ammonia was thrown at her, she used her dupatta as a shield, preventing any of the liquid from reaching her.

Senior PI of Sadar police station Mahesh Bansode said, “The victim HOD has refused to press charges, so we are not filing any case at this moment. We have recorded the statement of the alleged attacker and let her go.”

In-charge principal Deepak Kulkarni confirmed the incident. “Currently I cannot take any action against the attacker as she was appointed by the joint director. I will be submitting a report about the incident to the joint director. The attacker has not denied the attack in front of our Women Grievance Cell, and also submitted a written reply in which she admitted the attack.”

Sources said Shalu (name changed) used to work as a lab assistant for Deepali (name changed), HOD at IT department, from September till December. Deepali and Shalu were not getting along as the latter used to take unsanctioned leaves. So, Deepali had given a written complaint to Kulkarni.

“After receiving the complaint, I shifted Shalu to the chemistry department, to keep her away from Deepali. We had also held back Shalu’s payment for December as she had not attended college for even one day, without submitting any leave application,” added Kulkarni.

It is learnt that Shalu had on Tuesday submitted a complaint to Kulkarni against Deepali for alleged harassment. Kulkarni had sent the complaint to the Women’s Grievance Cell of the college.

On Wednesday, Deepali was sitting in her cabin when Shalu approached her carrying liquid ammonia in a beaker and threw it at her. Deepali used her dupatta to shield herself. Other teachers rushed to the spot after Deepali raised an alarm. Shalu was taken to a different room.

“Members of our Women’s Grievance Cell also inquired with Shalu, in whose purse they also found a knife,” added Kulkarni.

Soon, Sadar police led by PI Bansode were summoned to the spot and detained Shalu. The cops waited till evening but since Deepali did not show up to file a complaint, they let Shalu go after recording her statement.

AURANGABAD: Cracking a whip on the illegal trading of banned nylon manja in the market, the city police have registered nine cases in the past 24 hours against the suspect traders.

Most of the cases were registered on Tuesday on the complaints lodged by the officers of the anti-terrorism cell. The police after seizing ‘adequate’ amount of nylon manja, have slapped the traders with charges under section 188 of IPC for allegedly disobeying to the orders duly promulgated by the public servant.

On Tuesday, five offences were registered including one at Cantonment police station and two each at Jinsi and Pundaliknagar. On Wednesday, two offences were registered by the City Chowk police station. The process of registering offences at two more places was under till late on Wednesday evening.

In the past couple of days, the city police have seized nylon manja to the tune of Rs 50,000. About a month back, the Aurangabad city police issued a notification, about the blanket ban on the use of Chinese strings or nylon manja for flying kites in the city limits. Despite the ban, the strings were found to be sold rampantly in the open market.

The city police started acting against them only for the past couple of days. The police authorities have cited the dangers including these strings being good conductor of electricity, are also coated with harmful chemicals and pose grave threat to the flying birds, moving commuters and kids.

369,['16/01/2020'],KMRL yet to to pull down bund,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Kochi: Though coastal regulation zone violations have been rampant, authorities are yet to get their act together. A bund constructed across Kaniyampuzha, which falls under CRZ -I, for facilitating the work on the Metro’s viaduct along Vyttila-Thykoodam stretch, is still to be demolished even after the completion of the work. The work on the viaduct and the Metro pillars were completed almost two years ago and the Metro began services along the stretch a few months ago.

When TOI brought the issue to the notice of Kochi Metro Rail Ltd managing director Alkesh Kumar, he said: “We will check on it.” The bund has been causing waterlogging in the area. Moreover, the bund obstructs the flow of the tidal-influenced waterbody.

Local residents allege that the authorities have been reluctant to demolish the bund as they want to provide road access to a nearby island, where several realty projects are progressing.

“The bund constructed by the KMRL has the width of a four-lane road. Though the island can be accessed on road from Tripunithura-Vyttila Road, it is a small one. The bund can be transformed into a wider road. So, land value in the island will rise,” a local resident who requested anonymity, said.

“Moreover, the tidal impact on the backwaters will also be obstructed. Over the years, it will help in exempting these areas from the ambit of CRZ rules,” he said.

But I am not in a state to talk,” said Saif, who along with two of his friends spent a day at the hospital.

Saif, 21, and his friends were picked up from the gate of their apartment complex when they were heading out for tea around 1am on Monday. Police allegedly stopped them, questioned them aggressively and manhandled them when they objected to the snatching of their phones.

The patrol police also asked them if they were Pakistani after learning their names and eventually took them to the police station. The students claimed the cops rained lathis on them from 1.30am to 3.30am and they were released only after getting an undertaking signed that they wouldn’t venture out late in the night. The incident went viral on social media, inspiring many others to share similar experiences they’ve had with police in and around the city.

371,['16/01/2020'],Nagpur: Vidarbha’s first winery uncorks in Bhandara,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Representational image

NAGPUR: In a first of its kind business venture for Vidarbha, a full-fledged winery started its commercial operations a few months ago in Bhandara with port wine bottles being marketed in that district.

SP Wineries is now finalizing its plans to market the product in Nagpur by next month and also to foray into the premium wine segment by next year. Shashichandra Jaiswal, whose family owns retail liquor shops, broke tradition and forayed into wine production just to “follow his passion”.

It all started as an idea almost a decade ago when Jaiswal took up a hobby of ‘home made wines’. Though a teetotaller, Jaiswal was always fascinated with wine as a ‘classy’ drink.

“My home made wines were tasted by friends and the feedback I got was that it tastes better than most commercial products. Finally, in 2015, I got a licence for a winery,” said Jaiswal.

With guidance from his Nashik vineyard-owner friend Rajesh Borse, who is also an office bearer of the All India Wine Producers’ Association (AIWPA), Jaiswal started work on his factory in 2017. Luckily, he had an in-house expert as well. “My nephew Shaurya has done his M.Sc in wine and alcohol technology and that proved to be a major advantage at our small unit in which his father Prakashchandra is also a partner,” said Jaiswal.

The next big question was sourcing of grapes. “I decided to buy grapes from Nashik so that the commercial production of port wine could start immediately. Port wine is made from non-premium grapes and accounts for 95% of all wine sales in India,” said Jaiswal.

In June 2019, the first batch was bottled. Jaiswal prefers taking small steps in this new business. “Right now, we are selling only in Bhandara, but by the end of February, our products will be available in Nagpur. It takes time to scale up the business as the volume of wine sales is very low compared to whiskey and beer,” said Jaiswal.

He has a plan in place to climb the value chain in the winery business. “Premium grapes will be grown here in Pauni in the next few years after which we will foray into the upper segment,” said Jaiswal.

While a bottle of port wine sells for around Rs200-230, a similar sized bottle of premium wine will go for at least Rs750. But to make it commercially viable, Jaiswal can’t rely on grapes coming from other cities.

He is convinced about grapevines flourishing in Vidarbha’s weather. “A few decades ago, I have seen grapes growing in Pauni alongside ‘paan’ leaf plants. So there is no doubt in my mind that the basic ecosystem exists. Of course, I will be taking advice from agriculture experts to further simulate conditions on vineyards for optimum quality of grapes,” said Jaiswal.

Deepak Khanuja, director of Nagpur Wine Club, said, “It is a matter of great pride that wines being made in Vidarbha are available in the market. This will help promote wine culture and moving up the value chain will also prove economically beneficial to farmers.”

Representative image

AURANGABAD: Aurangabad rural superintendent of police Mokshada Patil recently swung into action, following a tip-off, and scuttled the marriage of a minor girl at a village in the district.

“The 17-year-old girl, who was being married off by her parents, is a std XI student in a Marathi medium educational institution, and wants to become a police officer after completing her education,” Patil told TOI on Wednesday.

The officer explained to the girl’s parents and family members, as well as the would be in-laws, that they would face legal consequences for forcing a minor girl to get married.

“The girl’s family and others called off the plan to marry her as they were convinced that this is not the right time for it,” said Patil.

Patil personally went to the village and spoke to the girl and her relatives. “The girl’s marriage was being fixed on her grandmother’s insistence. The minor pleaded with her parents to let her study and fulfil her dream of becoming a police officer, but nobody listened to her.”

The officer said the girl’s aunt is works for Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA), but she too could not do anything to stop the marriage.

“The minor girl even told her teacher that she was not ready to get married, but they too expressed helplessness. The girl seemed to be scared of backlash from her family, especially grandmother,” said Patil.

The officer said that a photocopy of the girl’s school transfer certificate shows that she is a minor.

“The girl comes from a very poor family and her parents, who are illiterate, work as labourers. We did not reveal our source of information to them. Besides counselling her relatives, we also warned them of the consequences.”

The SP said the local area police station has been tasked to keep a close eye on the developments. Moreover, the officer also shared her personal number with the girl so that she can be alerted if she is forced to get married.

Patil appealed to citizens to alert police if they come across any proposed child marriage anywhere, especially in their areas.

KOCHI: In what can be seen as a big blow to Kochi Corporation authorities, the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) has denied approval for Padmasarovaram Project, which envisages construction of a cycle track and a walkway across Chilavannoor backwaters connecting Subhash Chandra Bose Road and Sahodaran Ayyappan Road. According to the KCZMA , the construction of the cycle track and the walkway across the backwaters will obstruct the flow of the tidal-influenced waterbody in the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) and flood-prone area.The Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) had begun the work on the project in December 2018 on behalf of the Kochi Corporation. The work on the Rs 9.5-crore project was started without even submitting an application before the KCZMA for getting CRZ clearance. Later, the local body authorities submitted an application for CRZ clearance after environmentalists and local residents raised objection against the project and moved the court. The KCZMA rejected the application as it was filed without following the prescribed specific format. Subsequently, the local body authorities submitted a fresh application for securing a CRZ clearance for the project. “A detailed presentation was made by the project proponent (Kochi Corporation). The authority decided to decline approval since the construction of the walkway and the cycle track will obstruct the flow of tidal influenced waterbody in the CRZ and flood-prone area,” the minutes of the last meeting of KCZMA held in December 2019 states.Cheshire Tarzan, an RTI activist, has moved vigilance court alleging CRZ violations and corruption in the project. “The project was being carried out in violation of CRZ norms. Chilavannoor backwaters fall under CRZ-I. So, no construction can be allowed in the area. The intention of the authorities was to get Chilavannoor backwaters out of the ambit of the CRZ. The idea was to help those who constructed buildings off Chilavannoor backwaters in violation of CRZ norms,” Cheshire said. “The bund constructed across the backwaters will obstruct the tidal influence, and the high tide line (HTL), based on which the CRZ is fixed, will begin from the middle of the backwaters. So, the distance to the HTL from the shore will increase, and as a result, buildings off the backwaters will be exempted from CRZ limits. The authorities began the project after accepting bribe from builders,” Cheshire said.“Moreover, the fund for the project is availed from the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut). As per norms, Amrut funds should not be used for any projects, which cause damages to the environment,” he said.“The bund was constructed by placing trunks of coconut trees on the backwaters at fixed distances. It will be very difficult to demolish the bund,” Cheshire said.Kochi Corporation authorities said they would appeal against the KCZMA’s decision. “We will file an appeal challenging the decision,” mayor Soumini Jain said. But sources with the KCZMA said the appeal petition is also likely to be rejected. “If the appeal raises any technical problems, there would have been a scope for reviewing the current decision. But the reason for declining the approval for the project is that it was being carried out in violation of CRZ norms,” a source said.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73285502,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-887829,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kczma-declines-nod-for-padmasarovaram-project/articleshow/73281318.cms

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has granted anticipatory bail to an army jawan in an attempt to murder case in Pathardi village of Ahmednagar district in November last year.

Granting conditional bail to Narayan Suryabhan Garje, Justice RG Avachat observed: “The injury certificate rules out an assault with a knife. If the applicant is arrested, his services would be at stake. The nature of injuries suffered were simple.”

Defence counsel NB Narwade argued that Narayan had come to his village on leave. “The complainant and Garje have a dispute over using a road from their farms and the parties have history of registering criminal cases against each other.”

The jawan has been booked under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation).

In the FIR registered on November 20, 2019 with the Pathardi police station, the complainant alleged that Narayan asked him to withdraw the court cases he had filed against him from time to time.

“It was after he refused, the army jawan felt offended and he allegedly assaulted him with a knuckle duster before trying to stab him with a sharp knife,” stated the complainant.

Lawyer Narwade said that after going through the medical records about the injuries suffered by the complainant, the HC observed that “If the applicant is arrested, his services would be at stake. Considering the nature of injuries suffered by the informant, it appears to be a case of bailable offence.”

Kochi: Central police probing the murder of a 17-year-old girl would take the accused to Valparai in the coming days to recover evidence, including the weapon used for the crime.

The accused, Safar Shah (26) of Kumbalam, was sent in police custody on Tuesday and on Wednesday he was taken to his house and the store in Ernakulam where he bought the knife for committing the crime.

“As per our investigation, the murder was pre-planned. The accused had bought the weapon ahead of taking the girl to Valparai and started stabbing her as soon as an argument happened over the nature of their friendship. The girl sustained numerous wounds on her body and bled to death,” said a senior police officer.

Police said the accused had travelled abroad and they have collected documents in connection with his travels on Tuesday. “Evidence collection on Wednesday was basic in nature and was limited to the city. On Thursday or Friday, we would take the accused to Valparai in Tamil Nadu where the crime was committed. The major objective is to recover the weapon, which he had tossed into a deserted location near the tea plantation where he had dumped the body,” said an officer with the investigation team.

The accused took the girl to Valparai and stabbed her to death on January 7. Advocate BA Aloor has said that he would appear for the accused in court.

Residents of Bharat Nagar celebrated the cancellation of the proposed road going through Bharat Van as they ga... Read More

NAGPUR: It took massive mobilization of people, multiple Chipko movements, year-long agitations, weekly activities and the state’s largest human chain to win the battle of Bharat Van. But a bigger green war still goes on.

Bharat Van is a small manifestation of a much larger problem of city’s depleting green cover. While the festival of Makar Sankranti brought the much-awaited good news of authorities dropping the proposed Bharat Van road, those celebrating are yet not completely content.

Proud of the citizens for “shunning sham development by building public pressure”, ad-guru Sanjay Arora feels that the city needs to be constantly vigilant and build further momentum to ensure that the other green zones too are saved. “Across the world we see two forces lined up against each other; on one side are the governments wanting to roughshod over environmental concerns in their greed and on the other side are citizens rising against it because they can already see the havoc climate change has started to cause,” he said.

Adding that these movements for most part are leaderless and spontaneous, Arora says, “This is just the beginning and we all should continue to fight for our right to a cleaner, greener city.”

According to intensive care physician Dr Abheek Ghosh, the city is now more vigilant than ever. “We have a large section of citizens who are passionate about environment conservation. To win the bigger war, people’s participation is needed,” he says.

Areas like Bharat Van should now be fenced and well-protected, suggests green activist Baba Deshpande. “Agencies like Nagpur Municipal Corporation and forest department should unanimously frame strict policies against tree felling. Hefty fines should be imposed on erring departments,” he adds.

Pointing out that approaching judiciary or organizing mass protests is not always possible, chartered accountant Sandeep Agrawal says that only education can help in winning the real war. “Right from primary level, the inter-dependence of trees and human lives should be stressed upon in curriculum. Why do we need thousands of people to stand in human chain? Isn’t it common sense that such age-old trees should not be cut,” he asks.

Green areas of the city should be converted into ‘no development zones’, said consultant Ashfaque Ahmed. “Like the city’s heritage committee, there should be a body of experts whose approval should be taken before executing any project-threatening green cover,” he says.

Demanding that trees should be given precedence over development, Bharat Nagar resident Shashi Kanoria says, “The concerned authorities should support individuals and NGOs while planning cities to ensure low carbon footprints. Like playgrounds, I hope that the judiciary gives protection to city’s green cover too, be it the green pockets at Empress Mill or Neeri.”

Not wanting to expect much from politicians or authorities, another resident Amit Heda believes that it is for the citizens to understand that “together we can”. “While politicians need to have genuine empathy towards the well being of the public and take care of their ambitions that come in the way of retaining natural resources, authorities should not bow down under political pressure. However, the real game-changers are the people who need to keep fighting to raise their voice,” adds Heda.

Calling the Bharat Van victory “a powerful shot in the arm” for green activists, Supantha Bhattacharyya, associate professor & director of PG English at Hislop College says, “All such myopic projects which cause long-term eco vandalism must be relentlessly resisted till they are withdrawn. We owe it, if not to ourselves, then to our children.”

378,['16/01/2020'],Mussoorie: Bad roads a blot on the Queen of Hills,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Mall Road was repaired under a year ago but has still developed potholes

MUSSOORIE: Several roads in the Queen of Hills have been badly damaged and are crying for urgent repairs even as roads at several places lack crash barriers and could lead to a risk for motorists.

Of utmost concern to residents and businessmen of the town is the condition of the Mall Road, which is regarded as the heart of Mussoorie .

“The Mall Road was re-laid by the Public Works Department (PWD) in March-April last year but just after the rains, it was damaged and developed deep potholes at several places,” said Pradeep Bhandari, a resident.

In fact, at several places, potholes in the road have been filled by simply paving with bricks. Residents complain that for a tourist town, these brick-paved potholes are a big eyesore.

Other roads similarly affected include the road between Kincraig to Picture Palace, Waverley Convent to Dhumman Gunj, Tehri bypass road and Barlowganj to Jharipani and Gandhi Chowk to Zero point, to name a few.

Another cause of concern is the lack of crash barriers along the side of the road at many places posing a risk of major accidents.

“At several places on the Kincraig-Gandhi chowk road, Tehri bypass road and near Bataghat, the road does not have crash barriers and even the cement parapets have broken down, posing the risk of accidents,” said Vinod Semwal, a former member of Mussoorie Municipal Council.

Moreover, at Kincraig, where a large parking is being constructed, the road has been in a bad shape since several months. Due to construction of the parking, the width of the road has also been reduced, leading to traffic bottlenecks.

After the recent snowfall in the town, the roads have become further damaged during the process of removal of snow by JCBs which residents say has damaged the surface of the road at several places across the town.

Meanwhile, with tourist season expected to commence in a few months, the local businessmen are demanding that the PWD must repair all the roads connecting the town.

“Tourist influx begins to pick up from March onwards and it is desirable that the roads are repaired before the tourist season so that tourists do not face any inconvenience,” said Jagjit Kukreja, secretary of Mussoorie Traders Association.

When contacted, officials of the Public Works Department (PWD) chose to play the blame game.

“The Peyjal Nigam had dug up large stretches of roads in and around Mussoorie several years ago but till date, they have not made the compensatory payment to PWD. It is issues such as these that are causing a paucity of funds for the department,” said Jagmohan Chauhan, superintending engineer of PWD.

When asked about the poor condition of Mall Road which was laid less than a year ago, Chauhan said that damage must have occurred owing to heavy rainfall and waterlogging.

If this is the condition of roads in a premier hill station like Mussoorie, one shudders to think of the state of roads in other hill regions of the state.

379,['16/01/2020'],IIIT-Raichur may soon shift to its hometown,"This story is from January 16, 2020

BENGALURU: The International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Raichur , currently functioning out of IIT (Indian Institute of Technology)-Hyderabad campus, is likely to come to Raichur, turning the long-cherished dream of the city to have an institute of importance into a reality.

According to Subodh Yadav, regional commissioner and Hyderabad-Karnataka Regional Development Board (HKRDB) secretary, a temporary arrangement has been made at the Government Engineering College, Raichur, to accommodate the institute. HKRDB will fund the renovation of the college besides other additional facilities that are required for the shifting of the IIIT to its hometown.

“We had proposed the same place last year when they were commencing the first batch. However, the institute wanted to go to its well established mentor institute centre and had requested some additional facilities in the engineering college,” Yadav said.

“This included approach roads, additional water facility and some other basic infrastructure. We have added these features. The team from the institute visited the college and were satisfied,” he added.

The Karnataka government is also opening a hostel facility for the engineering college that will have sufficient rooms to accommodate two batches of IIIT-Raichur students.

According to Subodh, the state government has handed over 60 acre land for the permanent campus — complete with basic facilities such as water and electricity. The construction has to be taken up by the Centre. Its first batch of students is being taught mostly by the faculty of IIT-Hyderabad and the institute is also yet to get a full time director.

IIIT-Raichur was announced by the MHRD in 2016. It came as a relief for Raichur which had by then lost to Dharwad in the race for an IIT.

380,['16/01/2020'],"Four decades on, no rules for Maha Irrigation Act 1976 yet","This story is from January 16, 2020

In 2015, the government authorities had assured the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court that the necessa... Read More

AURANGABAD: More than four decades after its enactment, the Maharashtra Irrigation Act , 1976, still does not have a set of rules for effective implementation.

During one of the hearings of a PIL filed by water management expert Pradeep Purandare in 2015, the government authorities had assured the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court that the necessary rules would be framed within one year.

With the new government coming into the power in Maharashtra, experts and activists have demanded that the needful be done at the earliest.

On Wednesday, Purandare said that the Maharashtra Irrigation Act of 1976 (MIA 1976) is considered the parent legislation as it provides for the foundation, framework and structure of water management in Maharashtra. “MIA 1976 has a bearing on other key laws including the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA) Act, Maharashtra Management of Irrigation Systems by Farmers Act (MMISF) and Irrigation Development Corporation Act (IDC). These Acts refer to the MIA 1976 in policy wordings. The implementation of these Acts, therefore, depends on the implementation of MIA 1976 — which itself has been without rules for around 40 years,” he said.

The operative part of any law includes a set of rules and the MIA 1976, therefore, is dubbed as least effective in the absence of the desired rules. The MIA 1976 deals with vital areas such as bringing the river water under the legal jurisdiction of water resources department (WRD), issuance of the command area and appointment of canal officers to specify their jurisdiction.

During the hearing of the PIL, the government authorities had told the court that a fresh committee was then set up on December 5, 2014, to suggest amendments in MIA 1976. The authorities had told the court that the government would be in a position to frame rules only after the committee submits a report. The government had specifically said in 2015 that the needful would be done “possibly within a year”.

While no progress has taken place in the legal case, water activists have now pinned their hopes on the new government. Water right activist Abhijit Dhanorkar said the new government must give priority to the framing of MIA 1976 rules. “Climate change manifestations are being witnessed in the form of extreme weather events, including droughts. Marathwada, especially, has witnessed a few deficit runs of monsoon in the recent past. Water could become a major issue in the near future and stoke regional and inter-state disputes. Having a sound legal framework for the government functioning could only prove beneficial in such a scenario — failing which, legal tangles are inevitable,” he said.

When contacted, senior officials from the Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC) pleaded ignorance about the issue. Maharashtra water resources minister Jayant Patil could not be reached for a comment on the issue.

381,['16/01/2020'],Love jihad making Kerala girls sex slaves: Church,"This story is from January 16, 2020

KOCHI: A day after the Syro Malabar church officially acknowledged that ""love jihad wasn't an illusion in Kerala "", it said it would begin a sensitisation campaign against the issue through Sunday Schools. Sources with the Syro-Malabar Church said that they are planning to use all their lay organisations to make Christian youth cautious about the ‘threat’.

On Tuesday, the 28th Synod of the Syro-Malabar Church released a public statement saying that Keralite Christian girls are being targeted and killed in the name of 'Love Jihad'. Priests said that Christian girls who are being converted to Islam and taken abroad are not living a dignified pious life, but are forced to become sex slaves.

“Many are even scared to use the term ‘Love Jihad’ but the Synod has now come out and said the exact words. There are reports of Christian girls getting converted and taken abroad. They are not living an ideal pious life either. They are made to live with more than one person and some are even pushed into becoming sex slaves,” said Syro-Malabar Media Commission secretary Fr Antony Thalachelloor.

Fr Thalachelloor said that the recent incidents in Kozhikode in which a 19-year-old woman was sexually abused and blackmailed into converting and instances of Christian women joining the Islamic State are examples of instances that got the Church worried. “It has also come to our notice that a Christian teenager was brutally stabbed to death after getting lured into an affair. Love affairs used to happen earlier as well, but the Church cannot overlook girls, especially Christian girls, getting targeted and later murdered on the pretext of ‘love’,” said Fr Thalachalloor.

The Synod, in its statement on Wednesday, said that movements like Love Jihad getting stronger would endanger communal harmony and peace in Kerala. It pointed out that around half of the 21 youths recruited to ISIS from the state were Christians. “It is a serious concern that several girls who are not accounted for in official records are being used for terrorist activities through Love Jihad. Statistics show that Love Jihad is not an illusion. It is a sad fact that police are not taking appropriate action in complaints,” the statement said.

Synod however said that they don’t observe Love Jihad in a way that it would affect the friendship between religions in the state. Instead of looking at it religiously, the authorities should look at it as a menace that would negatively affect the society.

BJP demands probe into issue

BJP leader Kummanam Rajasekharan has said the complaints raised by the Synod should be taken seriously and there should be a probe into the allegations.

He said such complaints are increasing in the state and the Synod’s demand that strict action be taken should be welcomed. “However, finance minister Thomas Isaac is learnt to have rubbished the claims made by the Church. This shows the CPM-Congress jihadi nexus,” he said.

The BJP leader said it is a serious allegation and the state government is turning a blind eye towards the issue.

Hundreds of complaints have been filed in various police stations across the state on the Love Jihad. But no arrests have been made so far in such cases, he alleged.

Meanwhile state police chief Loknath Behera said that they do not have any information on the matter. “If there is anything specific, the police will take necessary action,” he said.

Hazaribag: A man serving life imprisonment was found hanging in his prison cell at Hazaribag ’s Jai Prakash Narayan Central Jail around 2:30am on Wednesday. Yogesh Kumar Chauhan (32), a resident of Dhanbad, was in prison since 2015, after a local court found him guilty of murdering a relative, the jail authorities said.

Jail authorities said some inmates in the adjoining cell saw Chauhan hanging from the ceiling by a pajama in the early hours of Wednesday. Jail guards have sent the body for autopsy to the district hospital. The body was handed over to Chauhan’s relatives later in the day. Jail superintendent Hamid Akhtar said a case of unnatural death was registered with the Hazaribag sadar police station and a probe has been initiated. Akhtar said Chauhan may have hanged himself due to depression as he was being taken to Ranchi Institute of Neuro Psychiatry and Allied Sciences for treatment since the past few months.

383,['16/01/2020'],Open to induct JVM-P MLAs if Babulal joins BJP: Oraon,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Ranchi: State Congress president Rameshwar Oraon on Wednesday said the party is willing to welcome JVM-P legislators in its fold if they are willing to come on board, provided “they are willing to agree to certain pre-conditions of the party”.

Speaking at the sidelines of a Dahi-Chuda feast hosted by the grand old party on the occasion of Makar Sankranti at its state headquarters here, the 72-year-old IPS-turned-politician said, “Our party always welcomes like-minded people with open arms. Therefore, if JVM-P legislators want to join, they are welcome, but they must agree to certain conditions.” When prodded about the conditions, Oraon, who is a minister in Hemant Soren’s cabinet, did not divulge anything.

Notably, JVM-P insiders said Poriyahat MLA Pradeep Yadav and Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey are in touch with several opposition parties since speculations surfaced that party chief Babulal Marandi is contemplating merging the outfit with BJP. While Marandi has been tight-lipped about the issue, BJP sources said that he is in touch with its national vice-president Om Prakash Mathur. The BJP sources added that Marandi has been offered the post of leader of opposition in Jharkhand assembly if he comes on board.

Tirkey is in touch with Oraon for a possible switch since speculations began earlier this month. Yadav, who claimed he will not join BJP, had met Soren prior to the state assembly polls and sought to contest from Poriyahat on a JMM ticket after he was isolated within JVM-P after being released from jail on bail in a sexual assault case lodged against him in Deoghar in April last year. Yadav was eventually fielded by JVM-P. When contacted, Tirkey declined to comment. “I will speak at the right time,” he told TOI.

JVM-P insiders are waiting for Marandi to return from his overseas trip on Thursday. Marandi, the first chief minister of Jharkhand, had left BJP in 2006 following differences with the state leadership and floated JVM-P.

JVM-P made its electoral debut in 2009 assembly polls and won 11 seats in coalition with Congress. Over the next decade, Marandi and his party’s popularity waned as it won eight seats in 2014 state assembly polls and three in last year’s assembly election. “Realising that his popularity is waning, Babulal Ji has begun thinking of his political future and may be looking for a win-win situation thinking the BJP will project him as its CM face in the 2024 state assembly election,” a JVM-P functionary close to Marandi said on Wednesday.

Ranchi: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Wednesday sought the Centre ’s help to bring back the mortal remains of Jay Prakash Mahto (30), who died at his workplace in UAE on December 28 after an accident. Mahto’s family members had been running from pillar to post to bring back his body, but to no avail. Mahto was a resident of Manohartand in Dhanbad’s Sindri.

Reacting to an appeal on Twitter by Mahto’s nephew, Hemant Tweeted, “Would like to draw immediate attention of .@IndembAbuDhabi .@MEAIndia & .@DrSJaishankar 'ji to the plight of this family in Dhanbad. State administration through @dc_dhanbad has already sent all necessary documents to expedite the procedure. Our thoughts are with the deceased's family.”

Later, the CM said, “I sought help from the central government to ensure that Mahto’s mortal remains is brought back to India so that his family members can pay their last respects. I have also contacted the Indian Embassy of UAE, located in Abu Dhabi, Union ministry of external affairs and Dr S Jaishankar. The deputy commissioner of Dhanbad has also initiated the necessary formalities with the foreign ministry to expedite the matter.”

Dhanbad DC Amit Kumar said, “We have furnished all details to the Union ministry of external affairs. In UAE, it takes three to four weeks to complete all legal formalities in cases of accidental deaths. We are expediting the matter and I have taken UAE’s contact details. The body will be brought home soon.”

Jay used to work as a pipe fitter in Saudi Services for Electro Mechanic Works Company in Al-Qassim region of UAE. His brother Om Prakash Mahto told TOI: “Jay went to Saudi Arabia on June 24, 2019 through a private agency in Gujarat. He used to work in an industrial unit in UAE as a pipe fitter. While on job, he met with an accident and died on December 28. It has been 18 days, but we are yet to pay our last respects or complete the final rites.”

Mahto is survived by his wife and two young children, aged nine months and three years. Om added, “All our efforts to bring my brother’s mortal remains back home failed. Finally, when my nephew Tweeted on this matter, the chief minister took note. We are hopeful that the body will be brought back to us at the earliest.”

The Mahto family has lost its sole breadwinner in Jay. “I am unemployed and our family of six members apart from our three married sisters used to rely on the money that Jay used to send from there. I lost my beloved brother and we lost our only source of sustenance. We hope the state government comes to our aid and helps us by providing a family member with a job,” Om said.

Bokaro: Gupteswar Mahto won a farmland for a year in a unique annual competition organised at Manjura village in Kasmar Block on Makar Sakranti.

Representational image

NAGPUR: With dwindling revenues and precarious financial position, the Maharashtra government has decided to mop up funds through additional mobilization. A meeting was conducted under deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Tuesday where various departments came out with their respective proposals.

Excise Department too, put up its proposal where it suggested to lift the liquor ban from Chandrapur. It was also proposed to stretch wine shops closing time by one hour till 11.30pm in the state.

According to senior excise officials, state was earning Rs242 crore annually from Chandrapur district from excise duty till 2014-15, which it was losing out since last five years. They asserted that the ban failed to serve its purpose as illicit smuggling cases jumped to a new high. On condition of anonymity, they told TOI that Pawar and other ministers responded positively to the proposal and planning to discuss it during next cabinet meeting.

After large-scale demands from women in Chandrapur, the previous BJP-led government led by ex-chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had imposed the liquor prohibition in 2015. It was third district in state and Vidarbha as well after Wardha and Gadchiroli where liquor consumption was prohibited. The large scale resentment due to the ban had led to shocking loss of former union minister and six times MP Hansraj Ahir from liquor baron Suresh alias Balu Dhanorkar, who is demanding lifting of ban since his victory.

Excise officials told TOI that their proposal was discussed in detail where they presented statistics of last five years which included losses suffered and amount of illicit liquor seized. “We informed them on investigations by the cops in liquor smuggling cases, both in terms and number of crimes and as well as amount confiscated which surged in last five years.”

They also pointed out that the revenue figures would have increased in last five years if the ban wasn’t implemented. “We’re losing out on precious revenue of over Rs250 crore since last five years. This amount could have been utilized for better purposes like for farmers. Large-scale smuggling of illicit liquor is defeating the very purpose of prohibition.”

The government’s move however received mixed reactions from the public representatives and other netas from the district.

Social activist Paromita Goswami, the main leader who started the movement to prohibit liquor in Chandrapur through her organization Sharamik Elgar Parishad, said she and her organization would steadfastly oppose any such move by the government. “I am going to conduct a press meet on Thursday in this regard. We will inform on how the liquor ban has immensely benefited the people here and why it should be continued.”

Netas like MLA Kishor Jorgewar stressed on that a thorough review must be conducted before relaxing the prohibition. “The government needs to take a look on pros and cons of the ban in last five years. Not only the revenue losses, but also incidents of illegal smuggling and sale of illicit or spurious liquor should be taken into account. I’ve heard that over 40,000 offences have been lodged against illegal consumption.”

Defending BJP government’s move of prohibition in Chandrapur, former excise minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule said decision was taken after 90% Gram Panchayats passed a resolution in this regard, which was well supported by majority of women. “They can’t lift the ban by simply citing revenue losses. Instead they should strengthen the mechanism to prevent sale of illicit liquor by combining the police and excise force to launch the operations. I think the womenfolk there would strongly oppose any such move,” he said.

NEW DELHI: The abrogation of Jammu & Kashmir ’s special status under Article 370 is “a historic step” that will help J&K integrate with the mainstream, while also disrupt the cross-border proxy war being fuelled by Pakistan , Army chief General MM Naravane said on Wednesday.

He also said the Indian armed forces have “zero-tolerance against terrorism” and are fully capable of exercising “many options to counter those who promote” it. “We will not hesitate to use the options...We will respond in equal measure,” said Naravane, addressing the annual Army Day parade here.

He had earlier told TOI that there were enough viable and effective options to teach punitive lessons to Pakistan for aiding and abetting cross-border terrorism without crossing its nuclear red-lines, as was done during the “surgical strikes” of September 2016 and the Balakot air strikes in February last year.

On Wednesday, he said, “The scrapping of Article 370 is a historic step, which will connect J&K with the rest of the country. The decision has adversely affected the plans of the western neighbour and its proxies.”

The Army chief also said that he would ensure the 1.3-million strong Army continues to be “operationally ready” to meet any challenge of conventional warfare or threat posed by cross-border terrorism.

390,['16/01/2020'],Audi India to sell only petrol cars for now,"Audi India head Balbir Singh Dhillon (left) cricketer Virat Kohli during Q8 launch.

MUMBAI: Audi India will sell only petrol vehicles this year with all Volkswagen Group companies still reeling under the ‘Dieselgate’ crisis that had hit the group in Europe five years ago. With diesel engine powering 70% of Audi cars sold in India in 2019, its absence combined with a severely depleted portfolio as the company migrates from BS IV to BS VI emission regime, may see the German luxury brand’s sales slide to a 10-year-low mark.From a high in 2015 when it sold 11,192 cars, sales have slipped to 4,595 units in 2019. The carmaker had till 2013 led the pack of luxury carmakers, beating both Mercedes-Benz and BMW . However, its sales have plummeted since 2016.Speaking on the sidelines of the launch of premium SUV Q8, only its second BS VI model after sedan A6 launched last year, Audi India head Balbir Singh Dhillon acknowledged that the year would be a challenging one. It is only from 2021 onwards when its portfolio will be replenished and strategy on both diesel and electric firmed up that the turnaround can kickoff.“This year will be a challenging one, not only for Audi, but the entire industry.

MUMBAI: Audi India will sell only petrol vehicles this year with all Volkswagen Group companies still reeling under the ‘Dieselgate’ crisis that had hit the group in Europe five years ago. With diesel engine powering 70% of Audi cars sold in India in 2019, its absence combined with a severely depleted portfolio as the company migrates from BS IV to BS VI emission regime, may see the German luxury brand’s sales slide to a 10-year-low mark.

From a high in 2015 when it sold 11,192 cars, sales have slipped to 4,595 units in 2019. The carmaker had till 2013 led the pack of luxury carmakers, beating both Mercedes-Benz and BMW . However, its sales have plummeted since 2016.

Speaking on the sidelines of the launch of premium SUV Q8, only its second BS VI model after sedan A6 launched last year, Audi India head Balbir Singh Dhillon acknowledged that the year would be a challenging one. It is only from 2021 onwards when its portfolio will be replenished and strategy on both diesel and electric firmed up that the turnaround can kickoff.

“This year will be a challenging one, not only for Audi, but the entire industry. I see a flat year in the luxury market. The change from BS IV to BS VI cannot happen overnight. These are among the headwinds that we will face. The absence of diesel will also be felt. But we hope to emerge from all this stronger,” said Dhillon.

Indian Envoy to UN Syed Akbaruddin at UNSC in New York

NEW DELHI: In yet another bid to raise Kashmir at UN Security Council, China on Wednesday gave notice for discussion on issue. The discussion was slated for late in the night after informal consultations on other issues.

However, the move is likely to be thwarted again with French diplomatic sources saying the issue could only be resolved bilaterally. French sources said France knew a UNSC member wanted to raise the Kashmir issue but it was opposed to it. “France’s position has not changed and is very clear: The Kashmir issue must be settled bilaterally — as we have stated on several occasions and will continue to reiterate it to our partners on the UNSC,” a French source said.

Last month, France, the US, the UK and Russia had foiled an attempt by China to discuss Kashmir at a closed-door meeting of the UNSC. A closed-door meeting had been called to discuss an issue relating to an African country. China made a request to deliberate on the Kashmir issue under the agenda of “any other business points”.

393,['16/01/2020'],"Mangaluru City Corporation council will be constituted soon, says Vedavyas Kamath","This story is from January 16, 2020

Mangaluru: The council of Mangaluru City Corporation ( MCC ) will be constituted soon, said Mangaluru City South MLA D Vedavyas Kamath . The delay in this regard was on account of byelections to assembly constituencies across Karnataka, he said. He said the government could not take a decision in this regard earlier due to the byelections, and not any other reason, hitting back at the Congress leaders who had demanded that the government constitute the council soon.

The MLA wondered if the Congress had forgotten the past when the last time it came back to power and elections to the post of mayor and deputy mayor for the first term of the council’s five-year term was delayed by a year. Congress leaders must also admit to their failure to mop up much needed revenue to shore up the civic body’s finances when it was in power from 2014 to 2019, he said, adding they can’t shift the blame on the BJP for this.

The Congress leaders have alleged that the civic body that was ranked sixth or seventh in the All India Swachh Survekshan rankings had slipped to the 152nd position. This is a tacit admission of its failure to meet the benchmarks set up by the Union ministry or urban development department that determined nationwide Swachh Survekshan ratings during its tenure. The BJP that is yet to take charge of the council has no connection with this accusation, he said

Asserting that the people of this coastal city will witness a qualitative change in administration once the BJP-led council assumes power, Kamath said the party being in power at the state and Centre will help make this difference. The BJP had won more than two-thirds majority in the election to the council held on November 12, winning 44 out of the 60 wards for which the election was held, with the ruling Congress winning only 14 wards and SDPI two wards.

HUBBALLI: The chopping of as many as seven Ashoka trees, and the pruning of branches of Gulmohar trees at the entrance of Nehru Stadium purportedly for security purposes has irked Union minister for parliamentary affairs Pralhad Joshi . The minister reprimanded the officials of the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation ( HDMC ) for allowing the trees to be felled.

Terming the loss of trees ‘unfortunate, Joshi told the officials, “You do not have any concern for trees that take more than 10 years to grow. You have completely disregarded the fact that they too have life.”

Directing officials of the forest department to initiate stringent action against the errant HDMC officials, Joshi clarified that chopping of trees was not part of the BJP’s preparations for Union home minister Amit Shah ’s rally at the venue. “The forest department must ensure that those responsible for the loss of trees, regardless of what influence they have and the seniority of their positions, are held accountable. We are not here to organise rallies by cutting trees, and disrupting the ecological balance,” the minister said.

When Joshi questioned the police inspector entrusted with making security arrangements for Shah’s rally about the chopped trees, the cop replied that police had suggested that a few branches be pruned. “We were not aware that entire trees would be felled,” the inspector said.

HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said that the civic agency had decided to prune some of the branches of trees at the entrance of Nehru Stadium in order to ensure hassle-free movement of Shah’s convoy. “I had no idea that trees would be chopped. I have directed the zonal assistant commissioner concerned to look into the incident and submit a report,” Itnal added.

Shettar, Bommai take stock of preparations

Meanwhile, Dharwad district in-charge minister Jagadish Shettar, accompanied by Joshi, visited Nehru Stadium to take stock of the preparations for the Union home minister’s rally scheduled on Saturday.

Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai too paid a visit, before Shettar and Joshi, to the venue and inspected the arrangements being made. Expressing satisfaction with the preparations, he said, “Adequate arrangements have been made to keep order during the rally.”

The proposal for a flyover to decongest traffic is still on the backburner.The team of Vivekanand Vishwadanya, divisional controller of HDCTD; Mahadev R Munji, divisional controller, Belagavi; Ashok Patil, divisional traffic officer, and assistant traffic manager RL Kumarswamy; have prepared the report as part of their one-year programme on leaders in urban transport organised by IUT, New Delhi.Their study has suggested long-term, short-term and immediate steps, including regulatory and enforcement measures. The study factors in data provided by different departments such as public works, RTO, NHAI and police.The team suggested restricting the movement of buses based on demand, performance and time. Many buses can be diverted and long-route ones kept off the busy intersection, they said. While curbing bus movement, adequate public transport facilities have to be provided. The study also called for a clampdown on unauthorised parking and improving pedestrian infrastructure. No-parking and one-way rules must be strictly enforced, it said.The call for better public transport facilities comes on the finding that private transport makes up 84% of the traffic at the circle while the share of intermediate public transport (autos, cabs) is 7.3%. Public transport makes up barely 2%, says the study. More than 70% of the private vehicles are two-wheelers while four-wheelers are 14%. Auto-rickshaws and cabs have a share of 6.3% and 1% respectively.Poor traffic planning, the study points out, has caused multiple and overlapping movements, leading to congestion at the meeting point.Another major factor is encroachment of roads and footpaths by hawkers and illegally parked vehicles. Too many public and commercial activities are also held at the circle, leading to crowding.To improve the lot of pedestrians on the Dharwad, Niligin and Bijapur road – on average there are 35 pedestrians a minute, the study found – the NWKRTC team said a subway was required to ensure smooth flow. Pick-up and drop-off zones for auto and cab passengers should also be demarcated to ensure vehicles don’t lurk at all points.",hubballi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73304127,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-155247,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/build-subway-restrict-movement-of-buses-to-decongest-rani-channamma-circle-says-study/articleshow/73281089.cms
396,['16/01/2020'],Angadi bats for naming Belagavi airport after Rani Channamma,"This story is from January 16, 2020

BELAGAVI: Union minister of state for railways Suresh Angadi on Tuesday wrote to the deputy commissioner (DC) of Belagavi requesting that the Belagavi airport be renamed Veer Rani Kittur Channamma.

His communication comes in the wake of state government’s letter to DCs of five districts -- Mangaluru, Mysuru, Kalaburagi, Dharwad and Belagavi-- on December 13 and a reminder on January 7. However, the central government had rejected the name for Belagavi airport in 2018.

On December 13, 2018, the then chief minister answering a question of then chief whip of the opposition in the legislative council, Mahantesh Mallikarjun, said “the state had sent a proposal to rename the airport as Veer Rani Kittur Channamma. But the proposal was rejected by the Union civil aviation ministry.”

Suresh Angadi in his letter (copy available) stated that “it is requested to initiate necessary measures towards the naming of Belagavi Sambra Airport as Veer Rani Kittur Channamma Airport and fulfil the long-standing dream of Belagavi district residents. But, so far, no steps seem to have been initiated.”

C T Ravi, Minister for Tourism, said the state government is gathering feedback from all these districts for renaming of airports and the cabinet will sit and deliberate on the same. The finalised names will be sent to central government.

Ashok Chandaragi, a pro-Kannada activist pointed that Angadi in his letter has mentioned that so far, no steps were initiated to rename the airport. This is blatantly untrue, he added. “The previous coalition government headed by H D Kumaraswamy had made a proposal and it was rejected. The statement of Angadi suggests he is trying to take credit for the renaming, if it happens,” he claimed.

Angadi was unavailable for comments when ToI contacted him while Congress leader H K Patil said Rani Channamma is a deserving name for the airport.

397,['16/01/2020'],‘Muslims have sacrificed themselves in cause of freedom struggle’,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Dharwad: The Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) is a ploy by the BJP to divide the country on religious lines, charged social activist Kavita Reddy here on Wednesday. Participating in a protest at Anjuman-e-Islam Grounds, Kavita sought to remind the BJP of the sacrifice of the members of Muslim community in the cause of the Freedom Struggle.

Pointing out that neither the BJP nor the RSS had participated in the struggle for independence, Kavita set the martyrdom of Muslim freedom fighters in stark relief. “The BJP is using the CAA to invoke hatred in the minds of youngsters, and provoking them to render the social fabric of our country weak,” she said.

Kavita said that, regardless of differences in traditions and customs, all religions stressed the tenets of humanity. “It is interesting that the Indian Flag is seen flying high at all events organised to protest the CAA, while in those rallies organised to endorse the law, we only see BJP flags. The BJP is adopting divisive policies to garner political mileage. The people must come forward and express their opposition to the CAA and the National Register of Citizens most vehemently,” she added.

Najma Nasir, an activist who participated in the rally, underscored the marginalised position of Muslims in Indian society. “Muslims are even more suppressed than Dalits. They do not want our Aadhaar cards, but are asking for the birth and domicile certificates of our forefathers. Collecting documents is not an easy task, which is why opposing CAA and NRC has become compulsory,” Najma said.

Basirat Mulla, meanwhile, pointed out that all citizens of the country were the children of Mother India. “The people are being patient with the government despite the economy being in the doldrums. The government must not discriminate between people based on religion and must ensure that everyone has equal opportunities,” she said.

Bhavya Narasimhamurthy, Isabella Xavier, Rajeeja Begum Sangolli were among those who participated in the protest.

HUBBALLI: Overturning notions of literacy, road sense, road condition and traffic management, data shows among tier-2 cities in the state, Mangaluru was the worst on rash and negligent driving leading to deaths, followed by Belagavi, Mysore and Hubballi-Dharwad .

Overall, though, predictably, congested Bengaluru city led the pack, registering four times the number of deaths in Mangaluru due to rash and negligent driving between 2015 and 2017.

Across the state, nearly 30,000 people were victims of rash and negligent driving in that period, data from the State Crime Records Bureau shows. Data for 2018 and 2019 is yet to compiled.

A comparison of the five top cities shows 2,164 people died in accidents in Bengaluru caused by rash driving while 536 people were killed in Mangaluru.

Mysuru has shown a spike between 2016 and 2017, from 102 deaths to 132 while it dropped sharply in Bengaluru (794 to 629) and Hubballi-Dharwad, from 104 to 87.

“It has been observed that most drivers, whether driving others’ vehicles or their own, are rash in the coastal region and Kerala. Probably private buses, which have been synonymous with rash driving due to intensified competition, have contributed to this,” said Dr Shivanand Hiremath, a psychiatrist at KIMS. “This shows that the people of North Karnataka may be seen as brash but they are diligent drivers compared to their coastal counterparts.”

However, Dr MC Sindhur, a medical practitioner and civic rights activist, said even these figures must be questioned. “Where are the roads in Hubballi-Dharwad? Road digging and repair works have been going on for the past 5-6 years and people are struggling to reach their destination in time. It’s good to know that such incomplete roads are saving lives at least,” he quipped.

Vijay V Mayya, former national vice-president of Association of Consulting Civil Engineers in Mangaluru, said roads in the city do not have any technical or civil engineering faults. “Almost all roads have been widened enough and have met all technical requirements. Road accidents are more here because of behavioural issues among drivers,” he said. “Though the education level is high in Mangaluru, on road rules, it is a city of educated illiterates. Wiser people are not behaving wisely on roads and becoming a threat for themselves and others.”

Representative image

NAGPUR: Contrary to the popular perception about Laxmi Nagar and Dharampeth zones being tony localities, 27 out of 31 water samples found unfit for human consumption in all 10 zones in the city were from these two areas.

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s water works department, however, can heave a sigh of relief as nearly 92% of 381 water samples collected from across the city in December last year have been found fit for drinking.

The water works department (WWD) had carried out the exercise against the backdrop of water testing in metro cities last year by Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS).

NMC water works department executive engineer Shweta Banerjee told TOI that the department carried out the tests with the help of Regional Public Health Laboratory and Government Medical College and Hospital in the city.

As a first step, the department identified 381 water sampling points in the city’s 10 zones covering entire city. Subsequently, the team collected samples from five sources of raw water, covered 184 slum areas and outlets of 64 elevated reservoir storages and 128 localities other than slums strictly following the standard operating procedures. The samples were tested in the RPHL on 19 parameters including turbidity, hardness, fluoride, colour test and odour etc, she said. “Out of the 381 samples, 350 were tested satisfactory and 31 proved unsatisfactory,” said Banerjee.

“Water supplied by the NMC is potable and if residents ensure their sumps or tanks are regularly cleaned, they can drink water straight from the tap,” she added.

Though Ashi Nagar, Satranjipura and Lakadganj zones are infamous for illegal connections, samples tested from these localities were found perfectly okay. The highest number of contaminated water samples were found in Dharampeth zone. Here, the tests revealed 17 different spots where residents are getting contaminated water in their taps. It was followed by Laxmi Nagar zone. Here, 10 locations were found where residents received contaminated water from the taps when the samples were collected.

In Dharampeth zone, the samples were collected a day after shut down announced to carry out some repair work. In all the 17 samples, the tests found no chlorine content. About Laxmi Nagar zone, Banerjee said the source of contamination was leak in the sewerage network and water pipeline.

One each unfit water sample was found under Gandhibagh zone, Nehru Nagar zone, Hanuman Nagar zone and Dhantoli zone, respectively. The test also showed that most slum dwellers are getting safe water. Of the 184 samples, only 12 were found unfit.

Besides this, Orange City Water – the company entrusted with 24x7 water supply and maintenance — regularly collects water samples and tests the quality. To a query, Banerjee claimed that the response time to every complaint of contamination that was received has been reduced significantly.

“Whenever a complaint is received, we immediately collect samples, supply to the area is stopped and water is being supplied through tankers. After rectifying the fault, we flush out the network and then charge it. Samples are collected once again and only if the contamination has been removed, we restore the supply,” she said.

403,['16/01/2020'],Nagpur: MSEDCL proposes astronomical Grid Support Charge for solar rooftop,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Representational image

NAGPUR: Even as solar rooftop consumers were celebrating the relief given to them by Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), MSEDCL has dropped a bombshell. It has proposed astronomical grid support charges, which will make solar power costlier than its own power.

The discom, it seems, is hell bent on scuttling the nascent solar sector in the state. MERC will have to once again reject its petition to save solar consumers.

MERC had recently dismissed the discom’s petition to make net billing compulsory instead of net metering. It had, however, allowed MSEDCL to levy grid support charge (GSC) for consumers having load more than 10 KW.

The discom has proposed GSC ranging from Rs 4.46 per unit to Rs 8.66 per unit for domestic consumers, between Rs 5.06 and Rs 8.76 per unit for commercial consumers and between Rs 3.60 per unit and Rs 4.08 per unit for industrial consumers.

A senior MSEDCL official admitted that if these charges were allowed by MERC, it would make solar rooftop power costlier than the discom tariff.

MSEDCL, in its petition submitted to MERC for making net billing compulsory, had stated that it has incurred a loss of Rs 224 crore so far. Moreover, solar rooftop load had increased from 20.44 MW in 2016-17 to 288.80 MW in 2018-19. The company feels that if paying consumers go out of its net, it will have to increase the tariff for remaining consumers.

The discom conveniently forgets that solar rooftop power is only 0.3% of its total power purchase. In 2018-19, solar rooftop consumers generated 330 million units (MU) against 1.2 lakh MU purchased by it.

More importantly, MSEDCL is unable to meet its solar renewable purchase obligation (RPO) target. It was able to meet only 40% of its RPO solar target in 2017-18.

MSEDCL itself is not getting any response to its bids to buy solar power. It had recently floated a tender for buying 1,350 MW but only one generator supplied a bid for 5 MW.

On the other hand, MERC has increased MSEDCL’s solar target from 2.5% in 2019-20 to 13.5% in 2024-25. MSEDCL has protested this increase and told MERC that it is unachievable.

Commenting on the GSC, solar expert Ajit Ganguly said, “MERC had allowed MSEDCL to levy GSC so that it does not incur any losses. However, the proposed charges are so high that solar power will cost between Rs 14 and Rs 15 per unit. This is ridiculous. No other state in the country has done this.”

An industrialist said on the condition of anonymity, “MSEDCL wants to land the new government in trouble. Industries are finding it difficult to survive in the state due to high power tariff. Solar was the only option but MSEDCL wants to make it unviable.

405,['16/01/2020'],Nagpur: Central team quietly begins Swachh survey,"This story is from January 16, 2020

NAGPUR: The team appointed by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs arrived in Nagpur on Monday to inspect the city’s cleanliness based on various parameters of the Swachh Survekshan 2020. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials remained completely unaware about the number of people in the team and the locations they visited.

Nagpur is one of over 4,000 cities in the country which would be ranked on cleanliness in the survey. Some of the previous surveys witnessed poor ranking for the city. The parameters of the survey include segregation of waste, waste processing facilities, treating and reusing of waste water, and cleanliness at community and public toilets among others.

“The team is seeking information about the NMC’s measures based on all parameters of Swachh Survekshan 2020,” said a senior official of NMC’s solid waste management department.

It is learnt that the team is visiting markets and localities in the corporation limits to collect necessary information about the works or projects undertaken and completed by the NMC. The members are expected to continue their survey for the next 2-3 days, the official said.

Nagpur did not perform well in the Swachh Survekshan 2019 as its ranking had dropped from 55 in 2018 to 58.

The team will also collect citizens’ feedback which accounts for 1,500 marks in the survey. According to the data compiled by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, there had been a fair response from Nagpur citizens about their feedback related to cleanliness and sanitation status in their areas. Besides, the NMC has already secured 200 marks as over 20,000 citizens had downloaded Swachhta App.

“The NMC is taking all necessary measures to improve sanitation in the city and its ranking in the upcoming survey. However, it is impossible without citizens’ feedback,” the official said.

Mayor Sandip Joshi has warned owners of open plots in the city to ensure their properties remain clean or else the NMC will seize it. Currently, open plots across the city have turned garbage vulnerable points.

There is a rule under which the NMC can seize such plots, the mayor said during Walk and Talk with Mayor at Jijamata garden in Chhatrapati Nagar .

406,['16/01/2020'],Nagpur: Anglo Indians stand up to prove they aren’t going extinct,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Barry O' Brien ( President of AIAIA)

NAGPUR: Amid the protests over NRC and CAA , the micro minority of Anglo Indians too is gearing up for what it calls a struggle to keep their identity alive. A recent statement in Lok Sabha by Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad , that only 296 members of the community are left in the country, has left the Anglo Indians worried.

A bill that proposes to do away with the reservation for Anglo Indian community, two seats in Parliament and one in each state assembly, has been moved on the grounds that not many of the community are left.

As Anglo Indians prepare to prove their numbers, and show their tribe is not on the way to extinction, they say there are easily over 300 in Nagpur alone, leave aside 296 across the country.

The All India Anglo Indian Association (AIAIA) has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that a section of the community is feeling that a second betrayal is at hand, this time by the country’s elected government. The first is a reference to what happened after independence, when the British left them to their own fate. An appointment has also been sought from Modi, apart from Union home minister Amit Shah and the law minister.

Barry O’ Brien, president of (AIAIA), said a general estimate in the community is that there must be at least 3 lakh Anglo Indians in the country. “The Constitution defines any person whose father was a European and mother an Indian to be Anglo Indian. Despite the varied descent from father’s side, all types of Anglo Indians have a single culture and a common mother tongue, that is English,” he said.

The AIAIA is now bringing all state and city-level associations on one platform, so that a confirmed number can be reported. Brien, who was in Nagpur, also attended one such meet of the city unit of Anglo Indians association.

“After the developments, we have been approached by an association in Kerala, which has over 40,000 members. So far there had not been much coordination between the different associations spread across the country, which are now coming together for the cause,” he said.

Antony Besterwitch, president of the Nagpur unit, said the association here has 110 families as members. This means the number easily crosses 297 here in Nagpur itself. Apart from this, there are 25 families that are not members of the association, yet part of the community.

“Some choose not to be part of the outfit only because of reasons like lack of time to attend meetings or they stay far away,” said Besterwitch. There are Anglo Indian pockets in other cities like Bhusawal, Pune, Jabalpur and Bilaspur too, he said.

407,['16/01/2020'],Maharashtra: Excise revenue up 10% as liquor sales increase,"Liquor sales in the state have increased since last year. (File photo)

More dry days but liquor sales rose

MUMBAI: The economic slowdown has impacted many sectors, but liquor sales in the state have increased since last year. State excise collections have risen by almost 10% in the nine-month span between April and December 2019-the first three quarters of the 2019-20 financial year -compared to the same period in 2018. But the collections remain short of the target and by the end of the financial year, the shortfall could amount to Rs 810 crore.The sale of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) rose by 5.8%, country liquor by 4% and beer by 2.5% in 2019, latest data shows. Wine sales in the state rose by 1.2% during this period.The highest volume of sale was from country liquor, which was 2,713 bulk litres, followed by beer sales at 2,342 bulk litres. IMFL sales were 1,624 bulk litres and wine sales were 54 bulk litres in April-December 2019.State excise collections during the first three quarters of 2019-20 totalled Rs 11,555 crore, up from Rs 10,546 crore during the same period in 2018. Sales rose despite additional dry days on account of the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections.But the fact remains that excise collections have fallen short of the target for the cash-strapped state, for which this is a key revenue earner. The state excise collection target for 2019-20 is Rs 17,477 crore. But the collections by year-end are expected at Rs 16,667 crore, amounting to a shortfall of Rs 810 crore.Although excise collections have grown by nearly 10% since 2018, the annual growth target was 14%. Indeed, state excise collections grew by this much during the previous financial year, when the highway ban on liquor shops was lifted, resulting in a surge in alcohol sales.Between April and December 2019, the monthly excise collection was Rs 1,284 crore as against a target of Rs 1,456 crore. That’s a shortfall of Rs 172 crore per month. To meet the annual target, excise revenues for the remaining three months of the financial year will have to rise to Rs 1,974 crore per month.State excise commissioner Prajakta Lavangare says excise collections are likely to pick up in the coming months. “Liquor sales have gone up compared to 2018 and we expect an improvement in excise collections in the remaining three months of the financial year,” she says.Officials say while sales may not have met the excise target so far, the target needed to be more aligned to the sales trend. They also say the main factor affecting liquor sales in the state was the higher tax rate than in neighbouring states like Goa, which have much lower MRPs.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73285391,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-683568,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-excise-revenue-up-10-as-liquor-sales-increase/articleshow/73285324.cms
408,['16/01/2020'],CBI team in J&amp;K for Patnitop probe,"This story is from January 16, 2020

NEW DELHI: The CBI has dispatched a special team of 30 officers to probe alleged violations of the master plan in the Patnitop area in Jammu & Kashmir, a fortnight after the state high court directed the agency to complete the investigation within eight weeks and submit its report.

Sources said the role of a former minister was under the scanner and he may soon be asked to join investigation. The agency had registered a preliminary enquiry to probe complaints that 59 hotels and resorts were violating the master plan, officials said.

The special team was rushed to cover the “exhaustive probe” even as the agency faces a tight deadline. The officials are learnt to be stationed in Patnitop, Udhampur and Jammu and have collected documents of 50 properties in question from various authorities of the newly created Union Territory.

It has been alleged that 70% of hotels in Patnitop were running without registration and authorisation from the competent authority. “Non-compoundable deviation by property owners in Patnitop area was illegally compounded by a special tribunal which was not challenged in most of the cases by the Patnitop Development Authority,” an official said.

The authorities took no action despite non deposit of compounding fee by the hoteliers, he said. The tribunal compounded violations even in instances where no permission was taken for raising buildings , he said. Hotel owners had put electricity and water connections obtained for domestic use to commercial use and the properties were being run on the licences for guesthouses, the official added.

On December 31 last year, a Jammu & Kashmir high court division bench of Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Rajesh Bindal had directed the CBI to start an investigation into all aspects of the case, including issue of licences and permissions granted within the jurisdiction of the Patnitop Development Authority. The bench, taking note of a report prepared by the CEO of Patnitop Development Authority on its October order, had said the report detailed the permitted land use, existing use, violations as well as encroachments.

The bench was hearing a PIL filed by Harcharan Singh, owner of Krystal Hotel and Restaurant in Patnitop, seeking demolition of illegal and unauthorised buildings raised in the green buffer areas of the hill resort.

The bench noted that the report showed several of these guesthouses and hotels were misusing the land, which was earmarked for agriculture and where the Jammu and Kashmir Agrarian Reforms Act, 1976, was applicable.

409,['16/01/2020'],Indo-Pacific a divisive concept meant to contain China: Russia,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Describing the Indo-Pacific as a divisive concept, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday said the initiative was meant to contain China.

The new Indo-Pacific concept being pushed by the US, Japan and others was an attempt to reconfigure the existing structure, he said. “Why do you need to call Asia Pacific Indo-Pacific? The answer is evident — to exclude China. Terminology should be unifying, not divisive. Neither SCO nor Brics is exclusionary,” Lavrov said. The Russian minister also backed India and Brazil to be permanent members of the UN Security Council.

Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue, he also said an equitable democratic order should not be influenced by use of brutal force. “When we asked the initiators how Indo-Pacific is different from Asia Pacific, we were told it is more democratic. We don’t think so. It is rather tricky. We have to be careful about the terminology which looks benign but is not,” he said.

The Indo-Pacific has been a major focus area of India’s foreign policy in the last few years as the country pushes for peace and stability in the region.

Lavrov later called on PM Narendra Modi and conveyed to him that President Vladimir Putin looked forward to the PM’s visit to Russia in May to participate in the 75th anniversary celebration of Victory Day, and in July for the Brics and SCO summits.

“The PM noted that several important decisions and outcomes were reached between the two countries in 2019. He suggested that the year 2020... should be the year of implementation of those decisions,” the government said in a statement.

LUCKNOW: Making the fifth change in the leadership of her party in Lok Sabha in less than a year, BSP chief Mayawati has now appointed first time MP Ritesh Pandey (38), a foreign educated Brahmin from Ambedkarnagar, to head the party in the lower house.

Pandey has replaced Danish Ali, who joined BSP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and was being perceived as the party’s Muslim face.

While announcing Pandey’s appointment, Mayawati said that since a Muslim was already heading BSP’s state unit, she needed to give representation to other communities. Incidentally, with Pandey’s appointment, two Brahmins are now heading the party in Parliament — Ritesh Pandey in Lok Sabha and SC Mishra in Rajya Sabha .

Ali’s removal, his second since August, comes in an apparent bid to ensure “equal representation” of all communities within BSP, though sources in the party said Mayawati was unhappy with his frequent challenging of her hold over the party. “To bring about social equality in BSP, we have had to make some changes in the party since the Lok Sabha leader and UP state president are both from the same community. Ritesh Pandey is now the leader of the party in Lok Sabha while Malook Nagar is the deputy leader. BSP state president Munqad Ali will remain in his position,” Mayawati said. Ali, who was earlier the Janata Dal (Secular) general secretary in Karnataka , has experienced a rocky ride in BSP. Appointed leader of the party in Lok Sabha in June, he was first removed in August 2019 when he reportedly disagreed with the party’s support to the Centre on revocation of Article 370 .

Behrampore/Barrackpore: A block development officer in Murshidabad’s Domkal has written to the district magistrate to suspend social audit phase II in 151 gram panch-ayats across 15 blocks fearing ground-level resistance to the audit over “NRC scare”.

The audit is a mandatory programme conducted by the district administration to examine entries of beneficiaries of central schemes PMAY, MGNREGA and NSAP. The programme was scheduled from January 12 to March 20 in Murshidabad district.

The BDO’s letter said: “Village pradhans of my block have informed me that the situation is unstable due to the NRC issue. People are scared about NRC and are not cooperating with the administration. In some areas, we are not able to run government schemes sm-oothly. I request you to put the social audit on hold till the situation improves.”

The letter came a day after villagers in Birbhum’s Nalhati mobbed the BDO, who had reached out to households to find out what went wrong when a Delhi-based NGO asked them for some documents.

But the letter issued by the district nodal officer (social audit) to panchayats on January 10 doesn’t mention household survey. The officer instead asked pradhans and upapradhans to come to the block office with beneficiary lists.

CPM’s Domkal area committee secretary Mustafijur Rahman is not buying the BDO’s plea. “Why are the pradhans scared of furnishing beneficiary lists? At a time Trinamool has been speaking about corruption-free implementation of schemes, its pradhans don’t feel safe presenting the lists. Watch out for the panchayats where the audit was planned up to January 16: Farakka, Domkal, Kandi and Samserganj,” he said.

Under pressure from residents scared about NPR in North 24 Parganas’ Kamarhati that has a high refugee population, civic boss Gopal Saha has put up billboards in front of the municipality that NPR work has been “put on hold”.

The city woke up to a very smoggy morning on Wednesday, with AQI shooting past the 350-mark (indicating very poor quality air) across most monitoring stations for the first time this year

Avoid strenuous exercises early in the morning: Docs

KOLKATA: The city woke up to a very smoggy morning on Wednesday, with the air quality index (AQI) shooting past the 350-mark (indicating very poor quality air) across most monitoring stations for the first time this year.A combination of meteorological factors — thermal inversion, low vertical air movement and low radiative temperature of the ground — caused pollutants to hang low in the atmosphere, turning the air quality foul. This is typical winter condition — when the ground is cool and there is no or little heat transfer from it, West Bengal Pollution Control Board officials said.Track the pollution level in your cityVertical air movement, for example, was as low as 2 m/s on Wednesday. In such calm conditions, dispersion of particulate matters — PM2.5 and PM10 — become very slow. As the particulate matters linger in the lower atmosphere, the next day’s pollutants are added to the already toxic air. There is unlikely to be any respite from the spiralling pollution in the next few days as the wind speed will continue to be between 2m/s and 1m/s on Thursday as well, the officials said.Untimely rain on January 2 and 3 had done the city immense good, with the AQI moving within the satisfactory-moderate range. But the meteorological conditions rapidly changed from Tuesday night, affecting the ambient air quality.At Ballygunge monitoring station, the AQI shot past 400 after 10pm.At stations like Victoria Memorial, Rabindra Bharati University and Fort William, the air quality remained severe with the PM2.5 index staying over 400 between 3am and 7am.This is particularly alarming because Kolkata’s AQI is primarily driven by PM2.5 — particulate matter of diameter less than 2.5 micrometre — which are about 3% the diameter of a human hair and travel straight into the blood stream causing severe respiratory diseases.Worried doctors have advised citizens to avoid strenuous exercises in the open during early mornings when the ambient air quality is particularly foul.“Such ambient air can trigger a series of health issues even for a healthy person and worsen pre-existing conditions like asthma and COPD,” said Dr Debasish Basu, a preventive medicine expert.“We are hoping for a change in the meteorological conditions from next Monday,” a WBPCB official said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73289228,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-446155,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-year-old-problem-aqi-tops-350/articleshow/73283205.cms

A social activist has uploaded a video of the young actor violating traffic rules while riding a two-wheeler, which has a Bengal registration number, and urged Kolkata traffic police to act on it.In the video, the actor is seen riding a bike for a very short distance before bringing out a flower even as the song ‘Chale Ride Pe’ played on in the typical TikTok style. The video has already garnered over 6 lakh ‘likes’.The complainant, Aman Zaidi, has also tagged chief minister Mamata Banerjee in his complaint and provided a link to the TikTok video . “@MamataOfficial @KPTrafficDept He is a young famous Indian Tik-Tok star. He was born on 27 October 2003 and his age is 16 years. His nationality is Indian,” he wrote, adding: “He’s riding a Bullet and he isn’t wearing a helmet.” The two traffic violations are all too apparent — a minor riding a bike, that too without a helmet.Kolkata traffic police reacted to the complaint and stated in Twitter: “Thanks for info. Your complaint will be examined by our dedicated cell and adequate action shall be taken.” The social media cell of Kolkata Police has forwarded the case to Kolkata traffic police.“We have found in our preliminary investigation that the bike has been registered in February last year and it has been registered at the Alipurduar RTO in North Bengal. However, the video is inconclusive. It shows the actor riding a short distance, which can well be inside a compound. Even if this might be bad advertisement for safe driving, it does not mean that there was a crime prima facie. The possibility of the video being shot outside Kolkata is high since the actor hails from a neighbouring country and is now settled in Mumbai with Indian citizenship. In fact, several of his other videos show him wearing a helmet. We are waiting for clarifications before we proceed further,” said an investigator from the Special Raids Section. An IPS officer said they would comment only after they come up with some substantial leads.Cops have been using memes and spoofs for raising awareness on safe riding and the results have been phenomenal last year. The number of deaths due to bike accidents has fallen significantly from 82 in 2018 to 58 in 2019. Even among the victims who lost their lives, just 20 were found without helmets.“It has been over two years that Kolkata police has taken to memes to send across their message on the Safe Drive Save life campaign. The memes have been planned and designed by a social media team. But if such videos become popular, it sends the wrong message,” said the investigating officer.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73285749,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-95581,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-helmetless-bike-stunt-lands-tiktok-teen-under-police-lens/articleshow/73283174.cms

KOLKATA: The Bengal BJP will begin a campaign telling people they do not need to show any documents to prove citizenship under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The party will reach out to nearly a crore people in the state to spread awareness about CAA over the next fortnight, starting Thursday.

The campaign, which comes on the heels of a “we won’t show our paper” campaign by a section of intellectuals in the city, will help dispel myths about the amended citizenship law, BJP functionaries felt.

An 87-second video, in which actors such as Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Swastika Mukherjee, Konkona Sen Sharma and Dhritiman Chatterjee declined to show any document, went viral after it was released on Sunday. This prompted Bengal BJP to launch an intense counter-campaign.

“No one has to show any paper during CAA drive. Neither will they have to show proof of the fact that they were subject to religious persecution. They will need to give a declaration that the person was subject to religious persecution in Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan,” a BJP office-bearer said.

Union minister Babul Supriyo tweeted a dig at the video. “Nobody will ask for a paper. What kind of a paper? Why would anyone ask for a paper? Are you an immigrant?”

Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh, who felt the video was part of the Left’scampaign, said: “A section of intellectuals is campaigning against CAA. One of them unfortunately has a tainted background. Such campaigns will become counter-productive for Leftist outfits,” he said.

Kolkata: In a major reshuffle in Bengal, CBI has transferred officers holding key charges in the Saradha , Rose Valley and Narada case investigations. After a reshuffle of superintendent-rank officials a few days ago, the agency has now made changes at the DSP-level and of inspector-rank officers looking after daily developments in the Ponzi probes.

DSP Tathagata Bardhan, who has been playing a key role in the Rose Valley and Saradha cases apart from other Ponzi investigations, has been transferred to Delhi. Bardhan had played a major role in the Rose Valley probe in interrogating key accused such as Trinamool MPs Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Tapas Paul. He had also quizzed former Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar in Shillong.

Inspector Bratin Ghoshal, who has been involved in Saradha and other Ponzi case investigations, has been transferred to Bhubaneswar. Ghoshal had played a crucial role during the interrogation of Saradha accused such as Trinamool’s Madan Mitra.

Chuzom Sherpa, investigating officer in the Rose Valley Ponzi probe, too was transferred to Bhubaneswar. Sherpa was part of the team that quizzed Rajeev in Shillong. CBI sources indicated these two officers might continue with the Rose Valley probe while stationed in Bhubaneswar.

The investigating officer in the Narada sting probe, Ranjit Kumar, has been transferred to Delhi.

Earlier this month, the agency had transferred DIG Abhay Singh, who was looking after Special Crime Branch in Kolkata, to the Economic Offences Wing in Delhi. Partha Mukherjee, who was SP of Economic Offences IV in Kolkata, was posted as AIG (policy).

On Wednesday, CBI sources indicated that the transfers were a routine exercise. The rejig decision was taken last month when the agency’s director, Rishi Kumar Shukla, had held a meeting to take stock of the cases in Delhi. “Some of the new officers have already joined (in Bengal). Others will be replaced soon, making the team stronger. The transfers will not, however, impact the progress of the investigation,” an official said.

424,['16/01/2020'],Lt Gen Anil Chauhan : Army to withdraw some troops from northeast,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Lt Gen Chauhan pays tribute at Vijay Smarak on Wednesday

KOLKATA: Given the improved law and order situation in insurgency-hit northeastern states, the Army has decided to withdraw some troops from active counter-insurgency/counter-terrorism (CI/CT) duties and move them to the barracks, Eastern Army commander Lt Gen Anil Chauhan said on Wednesday. He was speaking after paying homage to martyrs at Kolkata’s Vijay Smarak on the occasion of Army Day .

This decision has far-reaching implications because the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) is also likely to be withdrawn from areas as troops withdraw.

“So far as the operational situation is concerned, the northern border remained quiet last year due to the Wuhan Summit of April ’18 and the Chinese Summit of October ’19. Now peace is being maintained without compromising on legitimate claims or positions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). I am also happy to say that the situation is rather stable in insurgency-affected states,” Lt Gen Chauhan said.

“Incidents of violence have come down drastically and a decision has been taken to withdraw some troops from active CI/CT duties and move them to barracks. The focus for the coming year will be to maintain a high degree of operational preparedness and train ourselves to fight in a technologically intensive environment,” he added.

According to him, nearly two battalions have been withdrawn from the CI/CT grid in districts of upper Assam. The Eastern Command GOC-in-C also said that there has been significant improvement in the situation in Manipur and Nagaland from 2016. While AFSPA is in place in several parts of upper Assam and Manipur, it was extended to the whole of Nagaland for another six months in December 2019.

The Army has maintained that the act is crucial for its proper functioning whenever it is deployed in a ‘disturbed area’. As troops are withdrawn, there will no longer be any need for the act that curbs certain civil rights.

Speaking on how Integrated Battle Groups (IBGs) would come in handy in the Eastern theatre, Lt Gen Chauhan said: “Our Army follows the legacy of the British army that prepared for longish wars in distant lands. An effort was made in the 80s to prepare the Army for modern conflict. That is when infantry divisions were converted to rapid divisions. Not much happened after that. Now, we are concentrating on organisation of formations that are more deployable, employable and capable of performing tasks. This can be effective along our northern border. We are looking at the 17 Corps (Brahmastra Corps) for this and some exercises have been held to validate the concept, organisation and deployment.”

File photo of Ejaz Lakdawala

MUMBAI: No jail wants to lodge Ejaz Lakdawala . Taloja jail authorities have requested that the gangster be not lodged with them. This comes a day after Arthur Road jail authorities wrote to the magistrate and Mumbai police commissioner saying Lakdawala, who was arrested by Mumbai Police from Patna on January 8, be kept at Taloja jail as they feared he could be attacked by members of Dawood or Chhota Rajan gangs lodged there.

“On Thursday, we will write to the 37th metropolitan magistrate court as well the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court requesting them not to sent Lakdawala to Taloja jail as hardened criminals—Abu Salem, Ashwin Naik, Kumar Pillai, J Dey killers Satish Kalai and D K Rao, Pune gangsters Gajya Marne, Sharad Mohol Pappu Nair and many others— are lodged here,” said an official of Taloja jail.

Superintendent of Taloja jail Kastubh Kurlekar confirmed that they will be writing to the court regarding this matter, but refused to divulge further details.

On January 14, TOI had reported that Dawood or Chhota Rajan men may attack Lakdawala inside jail.

With Arthur Road and Taloja jails raising safety issues on lodging Lakdawala, police are likely to explore the options of sending him to either Thane or Kalyan prison.

There is time for the final decision as Lakdawala will be in the police custody for a while as he is to be arrested in 26 different offences, including MCOCA offences registered in Mumbai alone. An accused is sent to jail once the court remands him to judicial custody.

Meanwhile, the 37th metropolitan magistrate on Wednesday granted bail to Lakdawala’s daughter Shifa Shahid Shaikh in a fake passport case. However, she will continue to remain in police custody in an extortion case in which she has been booked along with her father. Lakdawala had allegedly called up Bandra builder Khalid Qureshi and threatened him to pay Rs 25 lakh. The father-daughter duo is likely to be booked under the MCOCA.

Lakdawala was originally a member of the Dawood gang, but later joined the Rajan gang and killed one of the 1993 bomb blasts accused, Razi, at Rajan’s behest. He later left Rajan’s gang and began operating independently from 2001.

MUMBAI: Theft is the most prevalent crime in Mumbai, according to data for 2019 released by the city police on Wednesday, though it has dropped by about 6% from the year before. Causing hurt too figures high on the list, occupying the second spot (4,372 cases in 2019), followed by vehicle theft (2,693) and molestation (2,678).In all, 41,932 cases of crime were registered with Mumbai Police in 2019, a 0.1% increase from 41,901in 2018. Though rape forms a fraction of the cases, its absolute reported number is disturbingly high: 1,015 in 2019, up from 889 in 2018. The police have also shown a high rate of cracking cases, having solved 28,802 of the total 41,931 cases in 2019 and 28,812 of the total 41,901in 2018. In both instances, the police’s rate of solving crime cases is around 69%.Disturbingly, like for rape, there has been an increase in other serious offences. Molestation rose from 2,586 in 2018 to 2678 the next year, robbery from 931 to 987, extortion from 228 to 253, attempt to murder from 280 to 343. Murder cases remained more or less the same: 165 in 2019, up by just one case.Offences that registered a dip included theft (from 6,260 cases in 2018 to 5,888 in 2019), hurt (5,198 to 4,372), vehicle theft (3,203 to 2,693), and house breakin (2,244 to 2,058). Chain snatching (171 to 157) and dacoity (32 to21) dropped too, but the figures are not high enough for a city as populous as Mumbai to establish a trend in any statistically significant way.Joint commissioner of police (law and order) Vinay Choubey said the force has come out with several initiatives to tackle street crime and to solve cases. “The dip in some crimes is the result of prompt action, added with the use of technology to solving crime. The installation of CCTV cameras at various points in the city has also been a deterrent to criminals.”However, RTI activist Jeetendra Ghadge said that the crime data doesn’t reflect financial wrongdoing and real estate fraud. “We need to reform our criminal justice system to make sure such crimes are also taken seriously,” he said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73285505,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-162139,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/theft-rules-mumbais-crime-chart-but-drops-6-over-a-year-rape-cases-increase-14/articleshow/73285508.cms

MUMBAI: Mumbaikars spend an average 85 minutes a day stuck in traffic snarls and the situation gets worst in the evening with over 90% people being affected, found a survey conducted by a non-profit as part of a study on effects of congestion on people.The study, which covered 1,200 respondents including private car users, motorcyclists, office car users, kaali peeli taxi and app cab drivers, found that 75% of the respondents supported congestion pricing-a tool to decongest clogged roads by charging a fee that is sufficient to deter some motorists from taking out their private vehicles. For those not willing to pay a congestion charge, 27% of car users and 18% of motorcyclists showed willingness to shift to high-quality public transport.While 42% respondents said they suffered health issues due to congestion, 46% said they compromised on personal time. Productivity loss was a concern for 52% people. The survey showed that 65% of the trips were for work and the average distance travelled by an individual was 20km a day.

429,['16/01/2020'],Navy to rejig acquisition plans with eye on technological advancements &amp; fiscal prudence,"This story is from January 16, 2020

NEW DELHI: In keeping with futuristic weapon technologies, coupled with the need for fiscal prudence, the Navy has gone in for a major rationalization and re-prioritization of its long-term force level plans and arms procurement projects.

Defence ministry sources say the Navy is the first among the armed forces to finalize a rationalization plan for its capital acquisition projects, which ranges from withdrawing some tenders or Request for Proposals (RFPs) to reducing numbers in other mega programmes. “The Defence Acquisitions Council (DAC), to be chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh on January 17, will discuss all this,” said a source.

Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh had himself recently declared his force was “committed to progress modernization using available resources optimally”. The Navy would endeavor to get the “maximum bang for the buck, with prioritization, rationalization and economy of expenditure”, he said.

The maritime force currently has 125 warships and 15 diesel-electric and two nuclear submarines, along with 235 aircraft, helicopters and drones. Given the budget constraints, it would be reasonably happy to become a 175-warship force by 2027 despite the earlier 212-warship plan.

For starters, the RFP for the construction of four large amphibious warfare warships or landing platform docks (LPDs) at a cost of over Rs 20,000 crore by the Indian private sector is going to get scrapped. “The Navy requires LPDs but the existing RFP was based on technical parameters drawn over 12-13 years ago. New up-to-date technical specifications will be drawn for a fresh RFP,” said a source.

The long-pending mega project to build 12 Mine Counter-Measure Vessels (MCMVs), or warships designed to detect, track and destroy enemy mines, at the Goa Shipyard for Rs 32,000 crore will also get slashed. “The project will be limited to eight MCMVs now. A hunt for unmanned minesweepers will also be launched in keeping with technological advancements around the world,” said the source.

Another step will be to cut down the Rs 3,621 crore acquisition of 10 Kamov-31 AEW (airborne early warning) helicopters from Russia to six choppers, while the force will also drop the case for a survey training vessel.

TOI was the first to report last November that the Navy’s case for 10 more Poseidon-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft from the US had also been reduced to just six planes for around $1.8 billion. These six P-8Is will add to the 12 such “submarine-hunting” aircraft already ordered from the US at a cost of over $3.1 billion.

The reduction in the P-8I aircraft will be offset by the proposed acquisition of 30 weaponized Sea Guardian or Predator-B armed drones from the US, with 10 drones each for Navy, IAF and Army to hunt and destroy targets on land and sea.

Ashok Lahiri (File photo)

KOLKATA: Member of 15th finance commission and former chief economic adviser to the Centre, Ashok Lahiri , has slammed the goods and services tax ( GST ) as it could be ""messy and disruptive in the short run"". He has also indicated that the economy needs some corrective action.

""While GST will prove to be a game-changing reform over medium to long term, in the short run, it has proved to be messy and disruptive and poor in revenue performance,"" he said while speaking at a conclave organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce & Industry (BCC&I).

Lahiri pointed out that the GST Network (GSTN) was not fully ready when the new tax regime was launched in July 2017. This has assumed significance because some of these points are often raised in the last two years by Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra, who used to be the head of the empowered committee of state finance ministers during the GST rollout and a strong critique of the hasty rollout of GST.

Barely six weeks before the launch of GST, the tax rates were not decided and the specific rule needed to enforce the CGST, SGST and IGST laws were not settled, he said. Lahiri came down heavily on the hurried decision of providing compensation package for the states, which is now being considered as one of the lifelines for many states following a slow GST collection.

Lahiri, however, argued that even a deferred rollout could not have been better, as claimed by the Opposition parties.

Deepa T was killed by her husband Venkatesh G after she questioned him about his affair with another woman.

BENGALURU: A 30-year-old employee of a district government hospital was arrested on charges of murdering his wife by injecting pesticide on Monday night.

Ijoor police said Deepa T, 24, a resident of Ramanagara town, was killed by her husband Venkatesh G after she questioned him about his affair with another woman. Venkatesh is an on-contract data-entry operator with the hospital. ""He poisoned her when she was asleep,"" the police said.

According to police, the incident took place around 11pm on Monday and Deepa was declared dead on arrival by doctors at the hospital around 1am on Tuesday. ""Her parents had taken her to the hospital after learning that something was amiss,"" p olice said.

Deepa's father Timmaiah filed a murder case against Venkatesh, suspecting he may have injected poison. Based on the complaint, Ijoor police brought in Venkatesh for questioning and he confessed to the crime. ""He told us she'd cheated on him,"" police said.

Venkatesh and Deepa got married on March 23, 2019. Police said she learnt about Venkatesh's illicit relationship and told her parents about it in July.

""Both their parents met and advised him to discontinue the illicit relationship. But Deepa recently found out he hadn't done so and questioned him,"" police said, adding that they were yet to determine the chemical, syringe and other items used.

Venkatesh Kumar

BENGALURU: Chikkaballapura police have arrested a 21-year-old man on charges of murdering his 17-year-old girlfriend. Investigation revealed the minor was forced to consume poison to prove that she did not have an affair with another man.

Chikkaballapura superintendent of police (SP) Abhinav Khare told TOI they arrested Venkatesh Kumar of Kamalapura village after he confessed to the crime. Earlier, the family of the minor had thought the girl had committed suicide and police had registered a case of unnatural death.

“They were in a relationship for two years. Kumar, who had recently started suspecting her, took her to Tondebavi in Chikkaballapura on January 6 under the pretext of discussing some personal matter,” police said.

There, he repeatedly interrogated the girl about her alleged affair with another man from her village. “...Kumar had seen the girl speaking to a man and assumed that she was in a relationship with him,” Khare said, adding that when the girl denied the charges, he forced her to consume poison.

“While she kept saying she wasn’t in any other relationship, Venkatesh pulled out two plastic bottles from his pocket and asked her to drink from one of them. He told her that both bottles had poison mixed with the drink and that he would kill himself if she refused to oblige,” said Khare.

However, he had mixed poison in only the bottle he gave her. “The girl consumed the drink laced with poison,” Khare said, adding: “Kumar was shocked too and couldn’t stop her in time.”

Kumar then brought the girl back to her home on his two-wheeler and she told her family that she had consumed poison. She was first rushed to a local hospital and then shifted to Victoria Hospital in Bengaluru. She died on January 8.

“Just to give an impression that he too had consumed poison, Kumar laced his lips with it. However, when we found the second bottle that had only the soft drink, he confessed to his crime,” Khare added.

NOIDA: As many as 17 builders in Noida and Greater Noida, including Supertech, Ajnara and Mahagun, have applied for the stress fund offered by the Centre to complete their stalled real estate projects in the twin cities.

Besides Supertech, Ajnara and Mahagun, other builders who have applied are Capital Infra, Earthcon Constructions, Fusion Buildtech, La Residentia, Newtech, Nirala India, RG Group, Rudra Buildwell, Sikka Group, Royal Gold Link Projects, Skytech, Rajhans, KV Developers and Jyotirmoy Infracon, TOI has learnt. While some have asked for funds through their lenders to complete a single project, others for the delivery of a few of them. Supertech, for instance, has alone sought Rs 1,500 crore for the completion of 20,000 flats across 12 housing projects in the twin cities, sources said.

According to builders’ body Credai, these realtors have prima facie declared that they are eligible for the last-mile funding from the Union finance ministry as the value of their assets is more than their liabilities. The applicants are now waiting for their proposals to be approved.

Amit Modi, vice president, Credai-western UP, said, “The builders have placed their requests through financial agencies which invested in them. Now the applications will be up for scrutiny to see if the builders are actually eligible for the central funding. The assets and liabilities would be weighed.” “With the applications sent, the builders are now waiting for a response from the government on the same,” he added.

In November 2019, the Centre announced a Rs 25,000 crore stress fund to help complete over 1,500 stalled housing projects in India, including those that have been declared non-performing assets (NPAs) or facing insolvency proceedings.

However, only Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Rera)-registered projects that fall in affordable and middle-income group segment with positive net worth are eligible for last-mile funding. And the maximum funding a developer can avail for one project is Rs 400 crore. “The last-mile fund has come as a great relief to those builders who are stuck for want of cash flow and have completion deadlines to meet. The sooner the funds are disbursed, the better,” Modi said.

This came as a ray of hope for several homebuyers who have invested in projects of embattled developers in the twin cities. “We finally see a light at the end of a tunnel after a wait of nearly 10 years,” said Abhishek Kumar, president, Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association. Developers said they are looking forward to this fund not only to bail out the ailing real estate sector but also to help boost the sluggish demand in residential property market, particularly across NCR.

Like hundreds of devotees who had queued up to seek Baba’s blessings, they offered flowers to Natbali Sarkar and sought his blessings for eternal togetherness, after a dip in the river Ken. Every year on Sankranti, the tiny hamlet of Nat gypsies, Sarbai, in Banda breaks into a celebration. For 160 years, a colourful ‘aashiqon ka mela’ or fare of lovers is being hosted here to celebrate the eternal love between Natbali Beeran and the nameless daughter of Arjun Singh, the commandant of Bhuragarh Fort, which stands a few kilometres away.

According to folklore, Nat artist Beeran fell in love with the daughter of Singh but the commandant objected to the prospective union. On his daughter’s insistence, Singh mellowed but offered to agree on one condition. He told Beeran to make a rope of cotton (a weak thread) and walk over it across his village, crossing the river into the fort. Beeran’s success would mean ‘yes’ to the marriage. The Nat gypsy agreed and worked very hard to make several attempts, recalls Bhan Singh, a resident of the town.

“After failing many times, on Makar Sankranti, he attempted again and seemed to be nearing success. As he proceeded, the entire community sang and danced along the river to boost his morale. However, just as Beeran was about to reach the fort, the adamant father cut the rope. Beeran fell into the river, cracked his head on a rock and died on the spot.

Shocked and broken, the commandant’s daughter jumped after him.

Memorial now an icon of true love

Members of the Nat community built a memorial for Beeran and the woman. With time, this memorial became a temple of the icons of true love.

It is believed that while Beeran and his beloved could not unite, they bless young couples with eternal companionship and togetherness.

“Our families were against our wedding because we were relatives. But we prayed in this darbar and our marriage was finalised,” says Suresh.

“Beeran and his beloved are like Heer-Ranjha or Laila Majnu for this region. Newly married couples, especially from the Nat community, visit the temple and participate in the fair for blessings,” says Ruksana Hashmi , a social activist.

Banke Ram and his wife Ratna, who were at the temple, had come to ask for togetherness too.

“He stays in Mumbai while I stay in the village. I prayed to Babaji to bring us together,” says Ratna.

BENGALURU: On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, a group of citizens organised a silent protest by flying kites bearing anti-citizenship law messages at Russell Market in Bengaluru.

As many as 50 people assembled on a terrace in the market on Wednesday afternoon and flew kites with messages like ‘NO CAA’, ‘NO NRC’ and ‘NO NPR’. The protesters, however, refrained from shouting slogans.

At another off-beat protest, people from across faiths gathered near Mahatma Gandhi statue near Maurya Circle and recited prayers, readings, poems, hymns and verses from numerous religious texts.

“I was born into a Christian family but didn’t visit church often so my father advised me to visit a temple or any other religious place. No religion teaches you to do wrong. I can’t see why the government wants to tell us otherwise,” wondered an organiser.

LUCKNOW: A 26-year-old student of Lucknow University was allegedly molested and assaulted outside a mall opposite Gomti Riverfront.

The incident occurred on Saturday but the student could not muster courage to lodge a complaint out of fear of stigma. When her family members came to know about the incident, they encouraged her to report the matter to the police.

The woman lodged a named FIR at Gomtinagar police station on Tuesday night against two men.

The Niralanagar resident said that two men-—both residents of an apartment building in Mall Avenue—had been harassing and stalking her for a few days. On several occasions, they had also tried to intercept her and asked her to accompany them.

On January 11, she said, she was in the mall with her friends. When she came out around midnight, the two accused were standing outside the mall, she said.

They allegedly grabbed her hand and when she objected, they punched her multiple times before snatching her phone and throwing it away, she said in the FIR.

“The entire incident has been recorded in the mall CCTV camera. When I called the police on 112 through my friend’s phone, they fled, threatening me with dire consequences,” she said.

The woman added that she was initially scared to file a complaint or tell her family, but after the two accused continued stalking her, she told her family on Tuesday.

Her family members then encouraged her to lodge a complaint.

Gomtinagar SHO Amit Kumar Dubey said, “We are investigating the incident and collecting evidence.”

Gomtinagar sub-inspector Sanjay Gupta said, “A medical examination of the woman is being done.”

GHAZIABAD/NOIDA: Investigators have finally recovered the stolen SUV, belonging to murdered 39-year-old senior healthcare executive Gaurav Chandel, from Ghaziabad’s Masuri area, some nine days after his body was found near his house in Greater Noida’s Gaur City.

I soon informed the police control room,” said Nehra, the former cop. “However, I didn’t see who all left the SUV there.” Police said they had found a receipt of a shop in a Noida mall in the car, which could eventually turn out to be a vital clue.

Naresh Kumar Singh, SHO of Masuri police station, said, “Even as there was no number plate on the vehicle, the slip of the high security number plate affixed to the glass of the vehicle helped us in identifying the car as well as its owner, Gaurav Chandel.”

Subsequently, Noida police, a forensic team and a dog squad reached the spot and collected several evidences from the spot. Investigators later towed the car to Noida. Cops said they were checking the CCTV cameras in the area to identify who had parked the vehicle in Akash Nagar.

Deputy chief minister and guardian minister Ajit Pawar has asked the PMRDA to build alternative roads to reduce the traffic congestion as soon as possible

The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority is set to build a 2 km road in Hinjewadi to reduce traffic congestion along the notoriously busy Wakad-Hinjewadi stretch.Speaking to TOI, Vivek Kharwadkar, a planner with the PMRDA, said set a of alternative roads has become a priority project for the agency. “Deputy chief minister and guardian minister Ajit Pawar has asked the PMRDA to build alternative roads to reduce the traffic congestion as soon as possible.”The Wakad-Hinjewadi road, from Wakad chowk on the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway to Shivaji chowk in Phase I of the Hinjewadi IT park area is the main road, which currently has two to three lanes. Nearly 4 lakh IT workers use the road daily for their commutes. As a result, Hinjewadi has some of the most gridlocked junctions in Pune. A year ago, then Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner RK Padmanabhan had set in place a one-way rule on the road to ease congestion. But there are fears that urbanisation could further impact the carriageway width. A more immediate worry is the Metro project.The PMRDA’s Shivajinagar-Hinjewadi metro route is set to come up along this road and commuters said the work will only increase congestion on the road.“Even the smallest roadwork can throw traffic out of gear here,” said Vishwas Kaul, who works with a startup in the IT area. “So imagine how much chaos a giant Metro project can cause. Hinjewadi definitely needs more roads.”Officials said plans for the alternative road are afoot.Giving details of the project, an official from the PMRDA said: “A meeting between farmers, officials from the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation and PMRDA was held on Wednesday, during which discussions were held about the project. About 1.5 km of the proposed road lies within PMRDA limits, while the remaining 500 metres are within the neighbouring Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits. According to the development plan of the PCMC, the road is 18 metres in width, so we wrote to the civic body to increase it to 30 metres.”The official added that the agencies will get consent of farmers for land acquisition within the next 20 days.“We also plan to invite bids for the road project in March this year,” he said.Nagesh Sakhare, a member of the Hinjewadi gram panchayat said: “Around 200 to 300 agriculture families are expected to be impacted by the road project. The exact number will be known when the demarcation process is completed by the agencies.”An MIDC official said as per preliminary discussions held on Wednesday, the PMRDA will provide land while the MIDC will bear expenditure for this project.Dnyanendra Hulsure, president of the Hinjawadi Employees and Residents’ Association (HEART) said: “Around 47,000 vehicles pass through the Wakad-Shivaji chowk during the peak morning hours. There will be severe traffic congestion when the Metro work starts along this stretch in March this year. The proposed alternative road from Surya hospital to Hinjewadi post office will take at least two to three years to be built. So we quickly need an alternative road to reduce traffic congestion.”Others said the alternative roads were key to reducing Hinjewadi’s infamous traffic jams. Jaydeep Soni, an IT worker said: “Smaller lanes can be developed to accommodate cars and other light vehicles. Buses can use the main roads. Smart planning can ease congestion in Hinjewadi. With each passing day, it is starting to resemble congested cities like Bengaluru and Mumbai.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73286107,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-757106,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-two-km-road-promises-to-ease-hinjewadi-congestion/articleshow/73286108.cms

468,['16/01/2020'],Plot nod: Religious trust’s reputation will be examined,"This story is from January 16, 2020

GREATER NOIDA: From now, reputation of a religious trust will be evaluated before it is given permission to start operations in Greater Noida. The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) has revised the rules for allocating institutional land to religious trusts in the wake of limited availability of such plots in the city.

Apart from reputation, the trust will also have to convince the Authority as to why religious activity needs to be promoted in a certain part of Greater Noida, officials said. Till now, land allotment to religious trusts was done as per availability on a first-come-first-serve basis. Some 13 religious trusts are currently operational in Greater Noida.

Deputy general manager (institutional) of the Greater Noida Authority, AK Sharma, said that rules for allotting plots to religious trusts were revised on January 10. “Among other changes, a committee will take an interview of the trust’s management to gauge the needs,” Sharma said.

The 13 trusts had taken up land in Greater Noida before May 31, 2016, the day the last institutional scheme comprising 60 plots closed, while five more trusts are interested in opening a centre in Greater Noida. However, these five may have to compete with each other as GNIDA does not have that many plots to offer at the moment.

Depending on the size of the plot , GNIDA charges between Rs 8,700 and Rs 15,005 per sqm from institutional allottees. Larger plots command lesser premium, while the smaller ones cost more. The rates are same for trusts, societies or educational institutes, said Sharma.

The Authority would also ask the interested applicants to submit their income certificates and annual income tax returns. The officials would then run background checks on the key members of the trust’s management to ensure that they were not involved in any controversy in the past.

The committee would also try to ascertain how many members of a particular community stay in the vicinity of the proposed religious centre before taking a decision.

“The purpose of the centre and general perception of the trust would be taken into account as well. The religious centre would be allowed only after the district administration and the police department issue no-objection certificate to the trust,” another official said.

469,['16/01/2020'],Donald Trump: Book claims Trump has no idea India has a border with China,"This story is from January 16, 2020

US President Donald Trump (file photo)

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump , a “very stable genius” by his own account, is so clueless about history and geography that he does not know India and China share a border, according to a new book chronicling his howlers in what is presented as a chaotic, unhinged presidency.

One of the gaffes featured in the 417-page “A Very Stable Genius: Donald J.Trump’s Testing of America” by Washington Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig involves the US President and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi early in the Trump presidency. Trump is quoted telling Modi during a meeting ""It's not as though you have China right on your border..."" prompting then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to cover part of his face with one hand so as to signal something to Modi without Trump seeing it.

For the record, India and China share the ninth longest border (at 3380 kms) between two countries, longer than USA’s 3,141 kilometers border with Mexico. The border dispute also led to a war between the two countries in 1962.

According to the authors citing people familiar with the incident, ""Modi’s eyes bulged out in surprise"" at Trump’s remark. His ""expression gradually shifted, from shock and concern to resignation,"" according to excerpts from the book in the US media. One Trump aide concludes that Modi probably ""left that meeting and said, ‘This is not a serious man. I cannot count on this man as a partner.’?""

The aide also explains that “the Indians took a step back in their diplomatic relations with the United States,” although from all accounts, ties between Washington and New Delhi, and the personal relations between Trump and Modi, have gotten even closer since then, leading to the ""Howdy Modi"" rally in Houston last year and a prospective Trump visit to India in February.

The book also suggests Trump is clueless and ""at times dangerously uninformed"" about history, citing an anecdote from Trump's 2017 trip to Asia which involved a stopover in Hawaii and a tour of Pearl Harbor. The authors relate how, while en route to the memorial for US service members killed in the December 7, 1941 attack that brought the US into World War II, Trump ""pulled Chief of Staff John Kelly aside for a quick consult.""

""Hey John, what's this all about? What's this a tour of?"" Trump reportedly asks him. Kelly, the authors say, was momentarily stunned. Trump had heard the phrase 'Pearl Harbor' and appeared to understand that he was visiting the scene of a historic battle, but he did not seem to know much else.

From all accounts, Trump knows very little about geo-politics, including issues relating to India. He repeatedly interjected himself in the Kashmir issue last summer, offering to mediate between India and Pakistan , and in a public repudiation of Washington’s stand that it is a bilateral matter, claimed Prime Minister Modi had invited him to do so.

US officials had to contain the fallout from the clumsy public grandstanding, and one US lawmaker apologized for the President’s amateurish and embarrassing mistake.

Sector 22 residents have asked the Noida Authority to find an alternative way to build the school without remo... Read More

NOIDA: Residents of Sector 22 have started a campaign against the plan to cut several trees on a plot that has been allotted for the construction of a school.

Residents said the mature trees are essential for the area and they help prevent the stench from a nearby sewer line from reaching the sector. They alleged that the Noida Authority had earlier promised to earmark the plot for a park. But it was later given to a school. “The plot is earmarked for a school according to the master plan. But since 1987, multiple CEOs of the Authority have been promising that the area will be earmarked as a park and the trees will not be cut. However, the allotment was suddenly done in 2016 and the allottee is now trying to cut all the trees here,” said Pradeep Vohra, president of residents welfare association (RWA), Sector 22.

The 2, 500 sqm area is a vacant plot used by the local residents as a park and a common area. There are 25-30 large trees lining the boundary of the plot.

The allottee has been given permission by the forest department to remove 26 trees, of which nine can be cut and 17 have to be transplanted.

However, residents are demanding that either the school be allotted a different site or the construction be done in such a way that the trees are not removed. “The trees are very close to the boundary wall and the allottee has to leave a gap of around 10 ft for construction, according to the norms. This way the trees can also be spared. But they said that the trees will affect the building’s foundation even if they are not very close. We have asked the Authority to intervene and find a way so that these trees are not removed. People living here have planted these trees and seen them grow,” Vohra added.

The Authority has now put a hold on the plan to cut the trees. Officials said, the matter will be discussed with the school owner.

“We have called the allottee to discuss the matter. However, they have not turned up yet. We will talk about how the building can be designed so that fewer trees are affected,” said SC Gaur, the general manager (planning) at the Noida Authority.

Meanwhile, residents’ bodies like FONRWA, sector RWAs and environmental groups have also joined the protest and are asking the Authority to find a middle ground so that the trees can be saved.

Environment activist Vikrant Tongad said, “It is unfair that over 25 fully grown trees are being removed from a busy locality within the city without looking at an alternative. Even if it is legal, we need to consider the environmental cost of this move, when we are facing constant challenges of air pollution in Delhi and NCR.”

AHMEDABAD: For Nilanshi Patel, a 5'6"" teenager from Modasa in north Gujarat , her crowning glory is eight inches longer than her physical frame!

Modasa-based Nilanshi, a class XII (science) student who aspires to become an engineer has broken her own record by growing 20 cm hair in a year. Nilanshi has recently recently been named in the Guinness Book of Records 2020 for being the teenager with longest hair measuring 190 cm (6.2 feet).

Most people I meet want to know the secret to my luxuriant air growth but I rarely do anything out of ordinary. I wash my hair once a week which is a two hour long ritual,"" says Nilanshi who has to spend half hour drying it and an hour to comb.

Now, the team will have nine senior IPS officers and experts from different fields

GREATER NOIDA: The first police commissioner of Gautam Budh Nagar, Alok Singh, took charge at the Surajpur police station on Wednesday.

The state government had approved the upgrade of the Gautam Budh Nagar district to a commissionerate on Monday.

“The new system will be like that in Delhi. The 25-lakh-strong population of Noida is a mix of the rural and the urban, which is why there was a need for change. With the new system in place, senior officers who usually supervise from a distance will get to work on the field to ensure implementation of community policing,” Singh said.

Under the previous system, he said, there was only one SSP to look after the day-to-day tasks. Now, the team will have nine senior IPS officers and experts from different fields. “These officers will ensure that policing becomes citizen-centric … The team’s major objective will be ensuring the safety of the floating population of Noida and Greater Noida, including the 4.5 lakh working women who travel to Delhi and Gurgaon,” he said. Traffic management will also be a priority, which will start by identifying points that have structural and enforcement problems.

Restructuring under the new system is under way, with three SPs redesignated as additional DCPs and seven circle officers named assistant commissioners of police. More officers reached Gautam Budh Nagar to join the team. “Once the new officers settle in, a meeting to finalise the structure and responsibilities will be held,” Singh said.

Representative image

GHAZIABAD: All cases related to assault and criminal intimidation will be lodged as FIRs from now on, instead of non-cognizable offence reports (NCRs) for which a magistrate’s permission is needed to carry out probe.

Ghaziabad SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said the current system of lodging such cases as NCRs stalls probe and also fails to redress the complainants’ grievances. “In Uttar Pradesh , except for Ghaziabad, cases related to IPC sections 506 (criminal intimidation) are registered as FIR. This should not be done and I have directed all police stations to register FIRs under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), besides IPC Section 506, and start the investigation immediately,” he said.

Police officers said that in NCR cases, a preliminary inquiry is conducted to check if the allegations are correct and if it is found that further probe is needed, a permission is sought from the magistrate. A complainant can approach the magistrate and seek a directive on the basis of an NCR for police to register a case.

Naithani said the move is aimed at providing comfort to the complainants, who have already suffered injuries and had been threatened.

The SSP has also directed all SHOs to lodge cybercrime cases at police stations and not make complainants go to cyber cells.

Representative image

GHAZIABAD: The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) has floated a tender for the construction of a tunnel on the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) route between Delhi and Ghaziabad .

The 5.8km-long tunnel will start ahead of Anand Vihar station and terminate near Bharat Electronics Limited, near Sahibabad station. It is part of the 17km priority section of the corridor — from Sahibabad to Duhai — for which NCRTC has set a March 2023 deadline.

“Work on the underground tunnelling system will start shortly as the global tender for it has been floated,” said Sudhir Sharma, the chief public relation officer, NCRTC. “Unlike tunnels on other metro corridors, the diameter of the tunnel here is bigger at 6.5 m, as it will have the rapid rail travelling at 100kmph. Along the 5.8km tunnel, there will be one station, Anand Vihar,” he added.

The broad parameters of alignment and station will be dictated by the NCRTC but it is for the company to decide on the design and structural operations that it may wish to employ while carrying out the work. “The tender will be awarded under design and built mode, which means that the company will have free hand in designing the route and proposed station and thereafter, it will construct on its own,” Sharma added.

Along the total 82 km Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor , only 11.5 km will be underground, which will have four stations — Anand Vihar in Delhi, and Meerut Central, Bhaisali and Begum Pul in Meerut.

“The other underground section (5.7 km) is in Meerut and tender for that will be floated later,” said Sharma.

The entire corridor is likely to become operational by March 2024 and the estimated cost of the project is Rs 30,274 crore .

According to a detailed project report, the daily ridership is expected to be more than 8 lakh and once completed, the 82km distance between Meerut and New Delhi via Ghaziabad can be covered in less than 55 minutes.

Ludhiana: A Ludhiana Police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) shot at the wife of his friend with his service revolver in front of her two daughters at her house in the city on Tuesday afternoon.

ASI Sukhpal Singh, who was deputed at Jamalpur police station, then took her to a nearby private hospital in his car and threatened her daughters to keep mum.

The family informed the police on Wednesday morning.

Jamalpur SHO inspector Harjinder Singh said ASI Sukhpal Singh was present on duty on Tuesday. Thereafter, he left the police station and did not return.

Police said the ASI was a family friend of the 45-year-old woman for the past 10 years.

The woman’s elder daughter, 18, who is an eyewitness, said her father worked at a firm here as a supervisor. On Tuesday, her father was at work while she, her 16-year-old sister and mother were at home. In the afternoon ASI Sukhpal Singh came home and her mother prepared tea, which they had in the lobby. She and her sister were inside their room.

“I heard them arguing, but ignored it. Minutes later, I heard a gunshot and rushed out with my sister. The shot had missed its mark. In front of our eyes, the ASI again shot at our mother. When we raised the alarm, the ASI flashed the weapon at us and threatened to kill us all. He then took our mother to a hospital,” she added.

Out of fear, the girls did not even call their father. At night, they informed him and he rushed to the hospital.

“The ASI has threatened my wife that if she gave a statement against him, he would kill our daughters. We want strict action against him. He remained in the hospital with us till 2.30am to ensure that we do not call the police,” the woman’s husband said.

Assistant commissioner of police (east) Devinder Chaudhary said, “The family informed the police on Wednesday morning. The woman, in her statement, said the family had good relations with the ASI and they also borrowed money from each other. On Tuesday afternoon, the ASI told her that he wanted to purchase a new car for which he needed money. The woman told him that they didn’t have money and this triggered an argument between them. The ASI then opened fire. According to her daughters, they heard two gunshots. However, we have not found any bullet shells from the spot… the ASI may have taken those along. We are trying to trace the accused.”

The Division 7 police have booked the ASI for attempt to murder on the statement of the woman.

‘The two had an affair’

Later in the day, the police claimed that the ASI had an affair with the woman. “After her husband learned about it a few months ago, he asked the ASI to stay away from his wife,” said a cop.

Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “The ASI had an affair with the woman for long. At the hospital, he had deposited Rs 2 lakh for her treatment. A Special Investigation Team, comprising ADCP-4, ACP (East) and Division 7 SHO, has been formed to look into the case and arrest the accused, who has been suspended.”

CHANDIGARH: Considering high cash transaction at four toll plazas each in Punjab and Haryana, the Union ministry of road transport and highways has granted 30-day exemption to these toll plazas to convert a maximum of 25% Fastag lanes into hybrid lanes to collect cash from vehicles. There are nine toll plazas each in Punjab and Haryana.Toll plazas exempted in Haryana are at Chandimandir, Gharonda, Panipat, and Shambhu and those in Punjab are at Dapar, Ladowal, Berhampur and Dhareri Jattan. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has identified a total of 65 toll plazas across the country with high cash transactions and has given them an exemption of 30 days more. In other non-exempted toll plazas, just a single lane on each side would continue to be cash lane.In an another important decision, the NHAI has also decided that various concessions, like in case of villages close to toll plazas or vehicles returning within 24 hours, would only be offered to vehicles with FasTags. The NHAI’s national electronic toll collection (FasTag) programme has achieved around 58% target in Punjab and Haryana.NHAI regional project director K L Sachdeva informed TOI that on an average 500 FasTags are being sold from each toll plaza in Punjab on a daily basis. He said that around 40,000 vehicles pass through Dappar toll plaza on daily and around 55% of them now have FasTags. “I would also request those vehicle owners who have purchased FasTags, to ensure that their prepaid wallet linked to FasTag has enough money so that they are not stuck at the toll plazas and cause inconvenience to others,” said Sachdeva.The letter issued by the Union ministry on January 14 reads, “Depending on the traffic pile up at these 65 fee plazas, not more than 25% ‘FasTag lane of Fee Plaza’ may be temporarily converted to hybrid lanes. This is to be considered and decided on a case-to-case basis not below the level of the regional officer concerned.”At least 75% of lanes at these 65 toll plazas would remain operational as FasTag lanes in order to incentivize vehicles carrying FasTag.

Rohtak: Concerned over a large number of cyber fraud cases being reported in the district, police here on Wednesday issued an advisory to curb such crimes.

In 2018, 268 fraud cases were registered. This number swelled to 465 in 2019, said police.

Police said fraudsters were now misleading people by creating a website bearing the names of similar major companies. People who shop online remain under their radar. “Fraudsters are now hacking bank accounts through QR codes (quick response codes),” police said.

Explaining the modus operandi, police said to win the trust of people, cyber criminals pretended to be military personnel and put Army photos on their profile.

Once they defraud a customer, the their number in the phone’s blacklist. “They make a whatsApp call instead of a normal call to avoid getting caught,” it added.

Kurukshetra: Recent hailstorm and rain have damaged wheat crop on 652 acres of land belonging to 306 farmers of 23 villages in Ladwa block of Kurukshetra district, an agriculture department official said on Wednesday.

Kurukshetra deputy director of agriculture (DDA) Pardeep Meel said the worst-affected villages included Niwarsi, Sultanpur, Gudha, Sonti, Halalpur, Dugari, Lohara, Jogi Majra, Dabkhera, Gudhi, Bir-Sonti, Bhallari, Ghrolla, and Bakali.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, farmers of these villages started applying for compensation under the crop insurance scheme. The agriculture department is expecting more applications on Thursday. “As per the report till Wednesday, 306 farmers of Ladwa block applied for compensation,” DDA Meel said.

When asked about the loss to vegetable crops due to hailstorm, he said, “As of now, insurance is available for only the wheat crop. There is severe loss to vegetables, including potato, peas and tomato, but these are not covered under the crop insurance scheme. A different survey would be conducted by the government for that.”

Chandigarh: A Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) delegation on Wednesday met Punjab governor V P Singh Badnore and urged him to direct the Congress government to order a CBI probe into alleged nexus between ministers, Congress leaders and officials in allged “Rs 4,100-crore power scam”.

The move comes at a time when the government has finally asked Punjab advocate general to review the power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed during the previous SAD-BJP government. The incumbent Congress has been long been accusing SAD dispensation of signing PPAs that were in favour of the private power generators and harmed the state. Yet, it ordered a review only after facing lot of anger over repeated power tariff hikes.

On Wednesday, the delegation, led by SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, urged the governor to direct the state government to dismiss all ministers and officials who had dealt with relevant files which had allegedly caused Rs 4,100 crore loss to Punjab. It raised the demand for sealing all relevant files to ensure they were not tampered with. The governor was also requested to ask the state government to pay the additional “power tariff hike due to the scam” from the government treasury, instead of charging people for the same.

Sukhbir claimed that the state government had deliberately lost important cases in the court and tribunal after hefty amount had allegedly been taken by certain persons from private companies. The state government had concealed important information from courts and misrepresented facts to benefit private players, the SAD alleged.

The delegation said in the case of coal washing charges, for which the state was forced to pay Rs 1,400 crore immediately and Rs 1,100 crore soon, the erstwhile SAD-BJP government had clarified to the Rajpura thermal power plant management that the amount was to be arranged by the successful bidder. Once contractual obligations started, the private player started claiming costs of washing coal, which were rejected even at the level of Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC), and even the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) during the SAD-BJP government.

However, the delegation alleged, after the Congress government came into power, it adopted a dishonest approach in the Supreme Court stating falsely that there was no methodology to measure calorific value of coal at the project site. “This was a blatant lie as para 68 of the Supreme Court judgement of 2017 in Nabha Powers Limited versus PSPCL clearly states that calorific value of coal should have been measured at the project site,” the delegation submitted.

The governor was told that in the case of judgment of an arbitration tribunal related to charges of a coal company, it was revealed during a hearing in the high court that the Congress government did not challenge the award which granted Rs 1,602 crore to a coal company for two-and-a-half years.

The delegation also alleged that electricity consumers had been burdened by an additional Rs 22,000 crore in the last three years of the Congress tenure. Sukhbir later told mediapersons that the party would exercise its option to approach the Punjab and Haryana high court in case it did not get justice in the matter.

Ludhiana: Residents continued to enjoy the mild warmth of the sun on Wednesday, which brought in a certain pleasantness in the city. However, there is bad news in store for residents as the meteorological department has predicted rainfall activity in the city in the next three days.

Even as the sun was around for most part of the day before the sky turned cloudy in the evening, it failed to push the maximum temperature much higher, which was recorded at 15.4 degrees Celsius (three degrees below normal, and 0.7 degrees less than on Tuesday). However, the minimum temperature on Wednesday was recorded on the higher side at 6.6 degrees Celsius (a degree above normal, and 0.8 degrees more than on Tuesday).

Meanwhile, fog that appeared in the city on Wednesday morning did bring down visibility to 300 metres at 8.30am, which increased slightly to 400 metres at 11.30am. By 2.30pm visibility jumped to 1,000 metres, and further to 1,200 metres at 5.30pm.

As residents had barely started rejoicing in the pleasant weather after the recent rains, the Met department threw a wet blanket on their plans. A department official at Chandigarh said that for three consecutive days from Thursday, the weather forecast is ‘generally cloudy sky with a few spells of rain or thundershowers’. He added that the day temperature is expected to fall in the next three days, but the night temperature might rise. The maximum temperature is expected to fall to 14 degrees until Saturday, while the night temperature might rise to 9 degrees by the same day.

489,['16/01/2020'],"Cops go hi tech in issuing challan, violators remain indifferent","This story is from January 16, 2020

Harleen Walia

In a bid to smoothen the process of traffic violations while the city police has introduced e challaning system and is even sending the copy of challan to the violators through speed post, a large number of violators continue to remain indifferent in paying the fine for challans.

As per the data available with the police, only 23% of total 3,404 challans issued till December 2019, have been paid by the violators to the Police. The city police collected Rs. 2.71 lakhs till the month of December from 775 violators, while the fine for the remaining 2,629 challans is yet to be paid by the violators.

Senior police officials said out of these 2,629 challans, as many as 518 have come back to cops for various reasons, the primary being the incorrect address or change in the address of the violator. In such cases, challans are distributed to the zonal-level police personnel who then traces the violator and delivers these challans.

When contacted ACP Gurdev Singh said, “The number of people paying their challan is quite low, despite the simplification of the process of payment in a violator can make the payment in an easy way.

“Every effort to make this process public/user friendly has been made and violators can even pay through payment gateway using debit and credit cards. They they don’t need to stand in long queues in order to pay the challan. Ludhiana is the only city in Punjab with this advanced facilities to the violators. After a challan is issued to violators, they are given a time frame of a month to pay the fine and if they still fail to do so, the challan is sent to the court for judicial proceedings. After that, depending upon the orders the violators are ssued summons. If fine is not deposited, first bailable warrants are issues and and then non bailable warrants are issued to the violators.”

While senior police officials claimed that the facility was rare in Ludhiana and will go a long way in smoothening the process of challaning besides, curbing corruption to a great extent, some locals felt that there was need to spread awareness about it amongst the residents.

Some locals also felt that the system would help curbing the corruption and manage system with less manpower.

Amanpreet Kaur, a resident of Preet Nagar said, “This initiative is quite appreciable. People used to take the traffic rules quite lightly. Many thoughts they could get away by paying small amount, but with the advanced system, people will now have to follow the traffic rules or have to pay higher fines. So, this system will definitely help curb the corruption.”

Kamaljot Singh, a resident of Tharike however said due to lack of awareness the the advanced system may make things more complicated and lead to waste of funds.

Pay Rs 50 as postal charges with challan

In a meeting which was held with District Road Safety Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Deputy Commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal, the traffic police raised the issue of postal charges which were incurred by the police to send the e-challans to the violator of traffic via speed post. In order to solve this issue, Deputy Commissioner directed that the postal charges are now to be paid by the defaulter. So, a violator is now supposed to pay Rs.50 as postal charges along with the amount of fine.

Ludhiana: Two trucks caught fire after a collision due to dense fog on Ludhiana-Malerkotla road, near Khanna, on Wednesday. Driver of one of the vehicles, Gurjinder Singh of Muktsar, was injured in the accident.

“One of the trucks was going towards Malerkotla from Khanna. Near Fatehpur bus stand on Khanna-Malerkotla road, visibility was poor due to dense fog. As a result, it collided with another truck coming from the opposite direction around 10am,” said a cop of Isru Police Post.

Following the crash, the fuel tank of a truck burst and diesel spilled on to the road. “It triggered a blaze that engulfed both the vehicles. Onlookers rushed to the spot and tried to douse the fire,” the cop added.

An eyewitness said, “A passerby soon called up the fire department.”

In the meantime, an SUV, which was coming from Malerkotla side, suddenly jammed on the brakes on spotting the accident. This took a milk van that was behind it unawares, and it rammed into the SUV.

Khanna fire officer Yashpal Rai said, “Three firemen were sent to the spot along with a fire tender. The blaze was soon brought under control.”

Police said Gurjinder Singh was under treatment at Khanna civil hospital, where his condition was stated to be stable.

The crash led to traffic chaos on the road. Police had to divert the traffic to a Fatehpur village road to clear the logjam.

He said that around 40,000 vehicles pass through Dappar toll plaza on daily and around 55% of them now have FasTags. “I would also request those vehicle owners who have purchased FasTags, to ensure that their prepaid wallet linked to FasTag has enough money so that they are not stuck at the toll plazas and cause inconvenience to others,” said Sachdeva.The letter issued by the Union ministry on January 14 reads, “Depending on the traffic pile up at these 65 fee plazas, not more than 25% ‘FasTag lane of Fee Plaza’ may be temporarily converted to hybrid lanes. This is to be considered and decided on a case-to-case basis not below the level of the regional officer concerned.”At least 75% of lanes at these 65 toll plazas would remain operational as FasTag lanes in order to incentivize vehicles carrying FasTag. The Union ministry has directed the NHAI to take necessary measures within 30 days to ensure smooth flow of traffic through toll plazas and ensure declaring all lanes as FasTag lanes.",ludhiana,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73286243,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-684519,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/fastag25-lanes-in-8-toll-plazas-in-punjab-haryana-to-collect-cash/articleshow/73295963.cms
495,['16/01/2020'],Acute staff crunch bogs civic body down,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Ludhiana: The announcement of property tax inspectors and clerks that they would observe three-day mass leave can be seen as an alarm for the civic body, which is facing acute staff shortage. This has been affecting not only public dealing at the offices, but also the field works. Just as the property tax inspectors did, there is a danger that other branch employees can also dissent, making it difficult for the civic body to do its work.

Against sanctioned posts of 124 inspectors/senior assistants, only 37 are filled while 87 posts are lying vacant. Similarly 423 posts are sanctioned for clerks, but only 168 are filled and 255 posts are vacant.

The civic authorities claimed that they have taken up the issue of staff crunch several times with local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra and other seniors but it is not getting resolved. There are many branches in Ludhiana civic body where not even a single vacancy has been filled and additional charge has been given to the existing staff for handling the work.

The worst affected is building branch where the post of senior town planner is vacant, against six posts of assistant town planners not (ATP) even a single ATP is available. The head draftsman has been given the charge of ATPs of four zones.

There is already problem of illegal buildings and encroachments in city and enforcement is not possible without required staff in the civic body. There is no executive engineer in electricity branch, no executive engineer in computer branch, no junior engineer in light branch or workshop.

Requesting anonymity, one of the civic officials claimed that there is serious problem of staff crunch as city has grown tremendously. But instead of increasing the number of regular employees, the MC is opting for contractual staff, who are not competent enough to handle the job. He said one employee has been given several jobs at a time, which he alleges, is affecting the mental health of the employees.

When contacted, mayor Balkar Sandhu said the matter of staff crunch has been raised several times with senior authorities in Chandigarh and fresh recruitment has to be done at state government level. He said he has called up the employees union members for discussing the issues, which are troubling them so those can be taken to the right platform.

4 secretaries against sanctioned 2 posts

Where in other wings there is scarcity of staff against sanctioned strength, of two posts four secretaries are working at the moment. The officials, however, claimed two of these four are drawing salary against vacant posts of assistant commissioners.

496,['16/01/2020'],"Despite mayor’s assurances, property tax staff still on mass leave","This story is from January 16, 2020

Ludhiana: The property tax inspectors and clerks did not return to their work even on Wednesday despite mayor Balkar Sandhu assuring them on Tuesday evening that he would get their issues resolved. The inspectors and clerks have now approached the union of MC employees to raise their matter with mayor and commissioner. On Thursday, a meeting has been fixed regarding this.

Meanwhile, the rooms where inspectors and clerks do their duty wore a deserted look and visitors were asked to come again another day. Only those who had come to deposit water supply and sewerage bill, were able to get their task done as two employees were made to sit specifically for this.

A union member said the property tax inspectors and clerks were being told to recover water supply and sewerage dues, collect data of properties to match with UID number data by clicking the pictures of properties, issue the blue cards and also perform the duty of block level officer for voter cards process. Property tax inspectors also complained that they were being humiliated by the senior officials and despite doing work they were being targeted, he said adding that they did not get credit of their work. On Thursday, they will meet mayor Sandhu and hopefully, the issues will be resolved, he added.

Meanwhile, mayor Sandhu, said before going on mass leave, the employees should have first come to him. He said without recovering the dues from the public, the employees should not ask for salary from the department.

Nearly 50 property tax collectors/inspectors have gone on mass leave since Tuesday, claiming that they are being overworked and that they were assigned many tasks at a time and it was affecting their personal lives as well.

497,['16/01/2020'],Peda upgrades bio-CNG plant at Hambran Road,"This story is from January 16, 2020

Ludhiana: To put an end to pollution in Buddha Nullah being contributed by the dairy industry at Hambran Road, the Punjab Energy Development Authority (Peda) has upgraded the bio-CNG plant in the dairy complex. Peda will hand over this plant to private player for operation and maintenance (O&M). Earlier, the plant was not fully functional due to which the cowdung waste was not being utilised properly in the plant and the drain was getting polluted. Peda officials claim the plant is fully operational now.

The 1MW capacity bio-gas plant is running at Haibowal dairy complex in 2.42 acre of land since October 2004 and from 2012 the construction of CNG plant was started. Peda also conducted a trial run of this plant for almost a year. Now, this plant has the capacity to generate 4,000kg of CNG gas in one day and they are producing 42 quintals of organic manure for the fields as well. Almost 160 tonnes of dairy waste is produced in the Hambran Road unit for converting it into manure.

Peda district manager Anupam Nanda said, “We have completed the trial run and its fully operational now. We will hand it over to the private company for further operation.” He said it will help in utilising the waste in proper manner without harming the environment.

Meanwhile, for establishing a second bio-CNG plant at Tajpur Road, Peda has signed an agreement with municipal corporation (MC) and they will be signing the lease agreement with Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (Glada) this week. Glada has reserved land for such a plant for long time, now. Total chunk of land available is four acres, but Glada will give 2.5 acres for the plant.

These plants are required to curb the pollution level in Buddha Nullah because the dairy farmers, in the absence of any other source of disposing off the cowdung, were throwing the waste directly into the drain or in the sewage system, choking the system.
