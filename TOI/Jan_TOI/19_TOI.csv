1,['19/01/2020'],What’s wakei-seijyaku?,"Tranquillity is going to be the biggest wellness term of 2020. All over the world, people are trying to find joy in a single moment of peace and calm. Experts say it’s the first step towards finding tranquillity in the longer run. The Japanese call this wakei-seijyaku – a crafted tranquil moment. It could be that moment when you light a candle and get into bed at the end of the day. It can be the sound of birds chirping as you step out of your house in the morning, or, it could be those moments you create for yourself during the day to calm yourself – like making a cup of tea, silencing your mind for a minute, listening to your favourite song...Author Mari Fujimoto describes wakei-seijyaku as “the sum of its four individual characters: harmony (wa), respect (kei), purity (sei) and tranquillity (jyaku)”. He says, “Wakei-seijyaku is about taking the time, and care to care for a moment of inner calm. To live by wakei-seijyaku is to linger. To notice. To be present. The traditional teaceremony of Japan best exemplifies how this quiet, attentive peace might be achieved.”The idea is to do things in order to find moments of harmony – from the gap between breathing in and breathing out, to that second you find yourself alone on a the train platform... As you go about your day, keep these wakei-seijyaku moments in mind, and you’ll be in harmony and peace wherever you go.Be a silent observer. Sit in a cafe. That can be your wakei-seijyaku. Read a book. Observe others; you can actually learn a lot about yourself just by observing things and people around you. If you want to further disconnect yourself from the mad rush, go and sit on the grass at the edge of a river or a lake close by. To be near a body of water brings about serenity and helps you think more clearly.Says Monisha Doley, confidence coach and author of Get a High on Spirit, “Find tranquillity in moments whenever your heart feels easy. Just allow yourself to be present. Look for tranquillity to overtake your mindand spirit. Feel at peace.”To pursue a calmer life, energy healing encompasses several different types of healing practices – from Reiki and chakra clearing to acupuncture, the list goes on. Though each is different, the essence of each treatment is the same – they are trying to restore balance to the body. The body is made up of seven chakras or centres – each responsible for a different source of energy.Try some vibrational therapy with vibrations from the earth and sounds from specific objects to helprestore peace within the body. All this will elevate your sense of wakei-seijyaku and help your body reach an optimum level of wellness.TEDx speaker Shruti Chatur Lal Sharma said during her talk on Euphonic Yoga (yoga combined with music and dance), that this form of yoga helps people discover tranquil moments in life. It has cultural nuances, and helps you create an atmosphere, where you can reconnect with your inner self – through stotra (hymn), beej mantras, breathing exercises, asanas, therapeutic mudras etc.“This step towards tranquillity includes guidelines mentioned in our ancient texts that are still relevant.It shows you a path that leads to a calm and serene life. It’s a healing and uplifting cycle, where practitioners sing, dance, perform yogic postures and feel each other’s vibes to find balance,” she says.Wakei-seijyaku is about taking the time, and care to care for a moment of inner calm. To live by wakei-seijyaku is to linger. To notice.

2,['19/01/2020'],Bengaluru is the rock capital of India: Antariksh,"Led by vocalist Varun Rajput , Hindi rock band Antariksh experiments with musical genres like rock, pop, reggae, Carnatic classical and funk music. The band also features Joshua Peter (vocals and keyboards), Shrikant Biswakarma (guitars and vocals) and Dan Thomas (drums). Talking to us at a recent college festival , where the band performed, Varun says, “Bengaluru is definitely the rock capital of India. When we started performing, I remember how every musician or band would perform here to see how well their music is received by audiences. The city’s response to new music is genuine, unbiased and comes straight from the heart. People here have good taste in music and enjoy listening to various genres as well. If the audience in Bengaluru doesn’t like your music, it’s a definite no in other cities as well.”That’s not the only reason Varun likes the city. “Bengaluru has excellent weather when compared to Delhi. We hit the roads to try dosa and chai when we arrived in the city. One can have a hearty South Indian breakfast here for just 40 bucks! That’s quite a steal. Bengalureans are also warm, gentle and courteous. There are many good rock bands in the city, like Thermal and a Quarter for instance. That’s why we’re always keen to visit the city,” he says.Varun further says that Antariksh aspires to make a bigger name in the Indie rock community. “We are very lucky, as our debut album Khoj and one of our singles from the second album, Kaaha Re, were appreciated by our fans and by many people from the music industry. We are planning to release our second album by the end of October. We hope to get an even better response,” he sums up.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73355584,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-223663/73355584.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/music/people-in-bengaluru-have-a-great-taste-in-music/articleshow/73355584.cms

Heels are considered empowering; falling on your face wearing one is not really the effect you are aiming for. To figure out your heel height, try on a pair with 3-inch heel and work your way up. You can borrow from a friend or family member.Whenever you wear heels, know that your feet will be pushed forward. So it’s important you tryyour heel out for the right size. It’s prudent to pick a size bigger than what you wear to avoid pinching.Try different styles from open to closed-toe shoes. While pumps are a good everyday pick, you don’t want a shoe that forces your toes together. Some feet are not shaped to be fitted in tapered styles and wincing in pain is not a good look.High heel shoes can make your legs look fetching but before you try on the heel for size, it’s important to stand up in them. Experts advise breaking in your heels by wearing them for about 10-15 minutes a day, couple of times.Just like the stand test, practice walking. Walking in heels is a major adjustment – for your feet and entire body. Attempt to walk in them for about 20 minutes a day.

6,['19/01/2020'],Will it be Santhanam versus Santhanam on January 31?,"It is common practice in the film industry to ensure that two films of the same actor don’t release on the same day as it would split the business and affect their box office collections. But now, the makers of Dagalty and Server Sundaram , both of which star Santhanam , have announced that their films will be releasing on the same date January 31.We spoke to the producers of the two films and both say that while this has been a surprise to them as well, they are hoping that things will get sorted.“We have been working towards this release date since December, coming out with the first and second singles, the teaser and so on. But it was only after we had announced our release date that the Server Sundaram team has announced theirs,” says SP Chowdhary, producer of Dagalty. He admits that the other film’s team did call and check with him on when he was planning on releasing his film. “I’d told them we were looking at January 31. So, it was a shock when they came out with the announcement that they would also be releasing on the same day. And since then, they haven’t gotten in touch with us,” he says.Meanwhile, J Selvakumar, the producer of Server Sundaram, has a different story to tell. “Our film was ready two years ago, and we have got it censored first. We were waiting for the right time to release it because we had a lot of issues that had to be sorted out. We were just coming out of that mess and thought we should release the film when things were looking good. So, we had informed the various players that we were hoping to release on this date. I’m not sure why the makers of Dagalty also want to release their film on this date, despite us having passed on the information about our film’s release to them,” he says.But the two producers remain confident that their films will do well even if they release on the same date. “I’m depressed because this is my first film, and I’m facing such a situation. I feel that if I back out after announcing the release date, it might affect my equation with the trade in the future. But I don’t have any problem if that film also releases on the same day. It could even be a double treat for Santhanam sir’s fans,” he says and adds that he has so far managed to confirm 350+ screens.“As far as we are concerned, this movie has a different content — a food-based commercial film. Santhanam sir had helped us get this title from the AVM family. The title itself has a value. And Santhanam sir is playing a chef. So, we are confident on our content. Also, ever since we announced the release date, we have been getting great response. The person who has bought our film is also confident that they can release the film on their own on this date. They have assured us that they will get the film to theatres,” says Selvakumar.Chowdhary says that he hasn’t spoken about this issue with Santhanam because it would be wrong of him to ask the actor to mediate. “I cannot ask him to support my film and not back the other one because both are his films,” he says. Meanwhile, Selvakumar says he is waiting to meet Santhanam and discuss this issue with him. “We couldn’t reach him; we were told he is out of station for a meditation programme,” he informs.However, Selvakumar has requested the Tamil Film Producers Council to help out. “The council actually helped us sort out our previous issues, so I’m looking to them for guidance. I hope we will get a better clarity in the coming week — since the Pongal holidays are now over,” he says, and adds that he isn’t averse to requesting the Dagalty team to reconsider their decision. “Since we are coming out of a struggle, both myself and my director have already requested their help. The struggle that we have been through in the past two years cannot be described in words. So, we want everyone’s help,” he says.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73355785,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-778756/73355785.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/will-it-be-santhanam-versus-santhanam-on-january-31/articleshow/73355785.cms

8,['19/01/2020'],Should you try skin fasting?,"The field of skincare is probably one of the most vibrant areas of research currently. From organic to natural to new compounds, modern-day skincare is an evolved science that has something for even the tiniest epidermal evils. Just like nutritionally, fasting has emerged as the detox tour de force – it was only a matter of time before the concept crept in to skincare. People started talking about skin fasting in 2019. Skin fasting is a period of time when you give your skin a breather from any products – but different experts have different interpretations. Celebrity dermatologist Dr Shefali Trasi Nerurkar suggests taking a break from any chemicals in the form of moisturisers, cleansers, toners, night creams and of course, make-up for a day. Dermatologist and aesthetic physician Dr Pallavi Sule advises doing away with application of one of the skincare products (her pick is a night cream) for one or two nights. Mumbai-based dermatologist Dr Soma Sarkar, however, debunks detox completely as it doesn’t hold any science behind it. “The skin needs a detox if the products you are using are not right or causing an issue like irritation,” she says. Yet skin fasting is a bonafide trend.Experts can see some merit in giving the skin a breather from products. Trasi says, “In this era, we are at times overdoing or over treating the skin. Every once in a while skin has the right to breathe without any cream or cleanser or toner. This may improve the skin quality.” Sule mentions how going off one product for a day or two can help the skin recover from the weakened process of production of natural oils. She adds, “It can work as a way to detox but the skin does not need detox from ‘all’ products. Different skin types have different skincare needs. For instance, dry skin will need a moisturiser. Plus skin changes its needs according to seasons.” A good way to ease in to this fasting routine is to do away with products that do not suit you that season.The concept was started by Koko Hayashi, founder of a US beauty brand Mirai Clinical that aims to bring in Japanese ideas of beauty to the western world. He claims that the Japanese have studied the skin’s regeneration on a monthly basis and proved that ‘skin fasting’ improves your skin’s condition and detoxify skin impurities. Even though Hayashi’s claims don’t find any scientific backing, many are ready to give it a whirl.Sule suggests seeking advice from your dermatologist to know the right course for you. “If one is not following a good regime or we observe any overuse of products, go off that product, not the routine,” she cautions. Sarkar suggests taking a break from routine make-up once in a while but not skincare. She says, “What you can do is to not overdo skincare regime – keep it simple yet significant.”A new-age technique where a person avoids every kind of skincare product like lotion, toner, and serum. Skin produces a natural oil called sebum for countering moisture loss and products hinder it from doing its work. It allows your skin to “breathe”Stop using products for a certain duration and once your skin returns to its natural state, slowly re-introduce themIt apparently strengthens your skin and helps it develop its own fighting mechanismIf you have a skin condition or use medicated products, ask your physician first. You will experience dry or oily patches at first- Duration depends on skin type and season like spring (not too hot or cold) l Ideal time is once in 1-2 months. Or even one day in a week- Go off all or some products depending on your skin type- Drink lots of water, fresh juices and don’t step out in the sun-If you have dry skin, try partial skin fasting and use coconut oil l If you have oily skin, use a towel and not a cleanser— Dr Shefali Trasi Nerurkar, dermatologist",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73327777,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-652729/73327777.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/beauty/should-you-try-skin-fasting/articleshow/73327777.cms
9,['19/01/2020'],How we socialise in 2020,"We don’t socialise over dinner parties anymore. Our friends aren’t just the ones we meet now and then over laidback dinner parties or quick coffee breaks. That happened in 2002. In 2020, there is no barrier in age or gender when it comes to friendships. A 25-something is best friend to a 55-something because they can relate to the same things. The world we live in has become far more unstructured and fluid, thanks to digital revolution.The 2020 principle of socialising is all about diluting yourself in a group for a greater impact. Young professionals are flocking to these playgrounds because ‘raising the self’ is the zeitgeist of our times. Our meetings or purpose of meeting people ismore intense in nature and unstructured in form – mostly because this is a Seeker’s Generation.Since the world became a global village, we started to find things far more common with a complete stranger than an old friend. Whether through Insta hashtags or FB hobby groups, people eventually started to form new friendships. This is a paradigm shift from the times when people used to meet old friends annually in an alumni group or once in a while. Says author and life coach Anand Chulani, “Far more people these days have started out in new cities and alien cultures because age isn’t a factor to decide where or how we want to live anymore. The best way to bond in such a scenario is to make new friends through joining a community. It doesn’t matter anymore whether you like to dance or cook, if you come together, you form new habits and friendships to last a lifetime.” Page 3 parties, once the toast of town, are now almost embarrassing to be spotted at, let alone being photographed for posterity. These days, people prefer going rock-climbing with friends, meet like-minded health freaks on a four-hour marathon or a yoga studio, or socialise on a food/heritage/culture walk.Gurpreet Wasi, founder of SuperSikh Run, says, “The socialising in my running group comes more naturally... the conversations are easy. It’s less about training, more about bonding, a fun way to interact with like-minded people. We don’t network, that’s very last decade. We are like a community which cares about our own spiritual growth by learning from one another.”The need for ‘engaged socialisation’ is emerging as the biggest way people bond in 2020. If you look at last year, people on a large scale came together all over the world — whether it was the Hong Kong democracy protests, the climate extinction march or the students’ march in India — to fight for common causes. The way we interact with one another is fundamentally changing. But this feeling wasn’t born in a day.Professor Antarpreet Singh, expert of digital learning, ISB, puts it simply when he says, digital platforms with a social setting have provided an excellent environment for people to bond, share views, have fun, cultivate new relationships and learn from each other. “We are witnessing the rise of ‘communities of interest’ – these are groups of people with common interests and a very strong motivation to learn from one another through interactions within a community framework,” he says.According to researchers this kind of ‘soul bonding’ is the way people live longer – much like the Japanese concept Moai (meeting for a common purpose), a term that originated from social support groups in Okinawa, Japan. They follow the Buddhist idea of ‘itai doshin’, which means “many in body, one in mind”. People, from every age, have learnt, that it is essential to start building your Moai. It can be done through running, food, heritage walks, travelling groups, dance classes…Chulani says this urge to raise the self is a result of all of us turning into “human doings” rather than being “human beings” over the last few decades. “Driven by corporate goals, we became activity managers obsessed with being busy. Most people used to find it difficult to be present in the moment. Community socialising is actually people’s way of rebelling against that old culture,” she says.These hobby groups are a good thing because they force people to come together physically to connect and spend time with each other. Reading a book alone is fulfilling, but being able to go to a book club and sharing ideas with people can make the experience even richer.Says Navina Jafa, a Delhi-based historian who conducts heritage walks in the city, “There’s more depth in interacting and socialising in small groups. In any culture walk, people come together to create collective memories, which eventually turn into beautiful friendships.” This is how we socialise in 2020; by creating new forms of intimacy.There’s more depth in interacting and socialising in small groups.

10,['19/01/2020'],"Tovino: Despite my role being small or big, I am totally committed to it","For Tovino Thomas , work is workout these days. The actor, who is currently shooting for Basil Joseph ’s superhero film Minnal Murali in Wayanad, has been getting in shape for the role doing a mix of cardio, core and strength routines and high intensity interval training along with CrossFit. And it is clear, even as we catch up with him at 10.30 pm after a gym session, is that he is willing to go the whole nine yards for his characters with a no-excuse approach. Excerpts from the conversation:It’s a comedy (laughs). Even if you take out the superhero elements in the movie, I can assure you it will still be an enjoyable film. Like Basil’s previous films Kunjiramayanam and Godha, the story is set in a fictional village and that’s where its hero Jason is struck by a lightning and gets his super powers.We have had fantasy movies like Njan Gandharvan, O' Faby, Athisayan and Sakshal Sreeman Chathunni that have worked. In this film too, we have tried to present the fantasy element convincingly. If you search online, you would find several instances of those struck by a lightning, experiencing differences in their lives like being able to make a bulb glow for a second or their watches stopping. So, when high voltage courses through the body its dynamics change somewhat. In that way, it’s also a realistic movie.That’s what I have been doing for a while now. Take my next release, Kilometres and Kilometres. I play an ordinary Kottayam guy named Josemon who has to look after his family. He has studied only till Class 10 and his intellect is limited. But in Forensic, I am playing a medico-legal advisor. So, his thoughts and way of approaching things are more refined. It’s also the first time I am doing a crime thriller. Minnal Murali is set in the 90s and my character is sort of a freaken, so there are different possibilities on how I can interpret the role. Meanwhile, Muhsin Perari’s Thallumala is set in Malabar and the story spans from a guy’s college years to mid 30s and in Jude Anthany Joseph’s 2403ft, I play an ex-soldier who ran away from the military. In Ajayante Randam Moshanam , I will have to put in the effort of doing three movies to play the triple role so I can convince the audience that all three are not the same person. So, the roles I am getting to play are all exciting and something that I haven’t done before. It’s very much in line with my criteria of not repeating myself.The film’s plot takes a turn when a foreigner enters the life of Josemon and he travels with her from Kerala to Khardung La on a bike, via Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Daman and Diu, Gujarat and Ladakh. We have tried to avoid the cities and focused on the interiors of the country. Everyone involved in the movie have been asking when are we doing its sequel? The entire cast and crew travelled on a bus, which we had used to sleep, store our costumes, art props as well as the bike and a dismantled rickshaw.If we had shot it the same way we usually do, it would go over budget. But for this film, everybody stood united to make it work; we ate, stayed and travelled together. In some places like Goa, we only shot in the morning and people were free to go anywhere after the shoot, provided they were back for the next day’s shoot. So, it was like going on a tour and the shooting was just part of it.She and her boyfriend Eden are artistes. They threw no tantrums and were in sync with us. I think people from outside the country understand us better. Even for them, it was a unique experience. While we were travelling, we encountered several varied climatic conditions. It was freezing in Ladakh, scorching in Rajasthan and raining heavily in other places.Our diversity is what makes India stand apart. Every 400km, our culture, food habits, dressing styles and languages change. You can’t see this diversity anywhere in the world. We have tried to include all this in the movie.I don’t completely agree with that. You can say that I had a release a month, if I was playing the lead role in all the films. But I did movies like Lucifer, Virus and Uyare. For me, every project is important. My job is to perform and promote the movies well. I do my homework for each role well and then go by what the director demands of me. Last year, I have done some good films like Luca and Kalki, which I still believe deserved a better run at the box office if not for certain circumstances. I also won an international award for And The Oscar Goes To…, so my conscience is clear. I give my full commitment when I am doing a film, despite the length of my role. In the past month, I haven’t gone home for my daughter’s birthday or for Christmas because I was busy with shoot.When you are working with established directors, you know what they are capable of and you can rely on them. But in the case of newcomers, you must blindly trust them. There’s nothing else you can do. When they come to me with their scripts and tell me they can confidently pull it off, I trust them. I can’t tell them to come to me after gaining more experience. If they must get experience, somebody will have to work with them. I’m here because people put their faith in me when I was starting out. So, I am aware of that and try to balance that while choosing the projects.I have always tried to react when it comes to political issues. Considering the ongoing protests, it’s not just me but a lot of people in the industry who have expressed their solidarity because it’s the need of a generation. However, I am not against those who are not taking a stand. Maybe that’s what they are used to and I am fine with that. Everyone cannot react to a particular issue the same way; we aren’t all robots.

11,['19/01/2020'],The return of repair,"Picture this: there’s a broken china cup in your kitchen. Would you try to repair it? Or maybe there’s a shawl with a hole. Do you throw it away or take it to a rafugar? It could be a copper utensil turned black. Would you go to a qaliywallah (polishers) to make it look brand new? If the answer to all of the above is yes, then you are a part of the quiet movement against ‘throwaway culture’ in home décor. Terms like repair, improvise, recycle, upcycle and mend are coming in to interior design. Homeowners are following the ‘buy me once’ motto to get products that last a lifetime – from cookware to hair brushes to toys.Francisco Martínez, an ethnographer at University of Helsinki, in his research found repair was “helping people overcome the negative logic that accompanies the abandonment of things and people”. Repair made “late modern societies more balanced, kind and stronger”. It was a form of care, of healing wounds, binding generations together. Martínez feels that repairing things establishes continuity, endurance and material sensitivity. He writes in his research: “Contemporary mending and the reluctance to dispose off material possessions can also be a way to resist dispossession and adapt to convoluted changes; the act of throwing away is perceived as a threat to memory, to security, and historical and ecological preservation.”British anthropologist Daniel Miller observed residents who fixed their kitchens. Those with strong and fulfilling social relationships were more likely to do so than those with shallow relationships. Architect Rishabh Sarpal says, “We are witnessing homes where people want structures of modernity that last a lifetime. From doors to furniture people seek designs that are forever. They don’t want to change their homes every other year. It’s considered uncaring and with no attachment.” Here’s all you can do to get in to the mending mindset…Rafugari is an age-old practice where craftsmen repair antique shawls and clothes with tender love and attention. Rafugars study antique patterns closely to repair clothes. They match the thread and finish the product in a way that it is hard to find any traces of repair. Rafugari needs patience and a clean hand to make the end product look neat. Most rafugars take out threads from the same piece of cloth which needs repairing. A trained rafugar also embellishes design when necessary to make parts of a piece look more eye-catching.Repair cafés are free meeting places where people meet to mend. It’s all about repairing things together. Such places are kitted out with tools and materials to help you make any repairs you need – on clothes, furniture, electrical appliances, bicycles, crockery, toys, etc. You’ll also find expert volunteers to assist you with some technical knowhow. The idea is to bring broken items from home and mend it together with the specialists. If you have nothing to repair, you can enjoy a cup of tea or coffee or help someone else with a repair job. A repair café in Bengaluru is reviving the dying skill of repairing things. Started by Antara Mukherji and Purna Sarkar, the idea is that repair economies don’t regard material things as expendable. The duo organise workshops, DIY classes and work tirelessly to relocate value in the working, relation and meaning of things.To celebrate longevity, and as a reaction to throwaway culture, there’s a rise of repair parties. Master fixers throw a party where you can go and get your household things repaired. You can repair everything from tables and lamps to jewellery and clothing. Interior stylist Bhawana Bhatnagar is a staunch believer in the power of repair. She says that even solitary acts of repair can create ripples. “Through acts of repair we experience products as expressions of our collective knowledge. We learn the art of cherishing things for a longer time, hence building a connection. Repaired products become bearers and extensions of personhood,” she notes.Sashiko is Japanese embroidery where intricate, typically geometric, designs are made using running stitch, commonly white stitches on indigo fabric. It started as a means to repair and strengthen old clothes to prolong their life, as earlier, fabric was very scarce in Japan and the poor had to conserve every scrap. These repairs soon turned into patterns, presumably because craftsmen wanted to make a dull necessity more interesting. Sashiko is not meant to be invisible. Rather, it highlights the rips, tears, frays, and fringes of garments with stitches in a contrasting thread and reinvent it to turn into something better than before – be it stronger fabric or a more beautiful design.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73330196,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-139027/73330196.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/home-garden/the-return-of-repair/articleshow/73330123.cms

With the one-day international series between India and Australia reaching its deciding match today, all eyes are on the game in Bengaluru. The demand for tickets to watch the game has gone up and those who have extra tickets, don’t seem to be complaining either.

With India registering a comprehensive win on Friday against Australia in Rajkot, fans’ expectations have doubled. “This was a convincing victory and we think the form is at its peak. There are great chances of them winning the match. That’s why I chose to buy the tickets. Luckily, I found someone in my company who had posted a message saying that he had extra tickets. It did cost me a tad more, but it is worth it,” says software professional Karthik S.

The prices of tickets that are being sold on Facebook and WhatsApp groups or other internet forums are up. From 25% to even 500%, the hike varies according to the stadium stands and the buyer profile. “I saw this group of enthusiasts from Chennai who were constantly texting on groups asking for tickets. So, I chose to sell the extra tickets that I had for twice the price. It's a win-win for both me and the buyer,” says one of the ticket sellers.

Another reason for local cricket fans to watch the game is the good form of KL Rahul . “Those boundaries that he smashed on Friday were just amazing. He knows Chinnaswamy Stadium well and it would be great to see him put up another amazing show for his local fans,” says Priya V, a home entrepreneur.

Cops warn of legal action against people selling tickets in black

Joint Commissioner of Police, Crime, Sandeep Patil says, “People are advised to buy tickets online only on the platforms that have tied up with The Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) or directly over the counter at the stadium. Anyone found selling tickets in black, online or in person, will face legal action. I’ve already directed the force in Central Bengaluru to keep an eye on the stadium.”

The Kannada film, which has Vikas and Sindhu Loknath in the lead, follows a ghost who is out to seek revenge, but turns out to be powerless to do so. “Though the protagonist is a ghost, the movie is in no way a horror story. There is a cute love story, along with lots of humour, emotions and action sequences. There are no jump-scares or horror elements. It is an entertainer that the full family can watch,” promises director Raj Pathipati. Filmmaker Som Singh, who is backing Kaanadante Maayavadanu adds that while there were offers to release the film in Tamil and Telugu as dubbed versions, he has decided to remake it. “We have approached Jayam-fame Nitin for Telugu and Siva Karthikeyan for the Tamil version. We should have confirmations soon,” he says.The movie is slated for a January 31 release, but had been in the works for about four years. “It has taken time, and tested our patience too, (laughs). There are days when we very worried that the project might get shelved, but we pulled through and believe that it the film has shaped up well,” says Vikas. Sindhu echoes this and adds, “I’ve been asked often if I’ve taken a break from films. Honestly, this project has kept me busy over the last few years. People may call this my comeback film, but as far as I am concerned, it is a project that will be a benchmark in my career.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73356035,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-209163/73356035.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/kaanadante-maayavadanu-to-get-tamil-and-telugu-versions/articleshow/73356035.cms
14,['19/01/2020'],Gut health and stress,"Stress has an almost immediate effect on our gut and digestive system. This is why we are likely to experience spasms in the stomach when we are stressed, or feel butterflies when we are nervous. The gut and brain are connected to each other via a system of nerves called the Enteric Nervous System and are thus constantly communicating with each other. This is exactly why the gut is also called the second brain. What happens in our mind directly affects our gut and vice versa.- Cause inflammation of the gut lining and increase intestinal permeability leading to leaky gut. Leaky gut is the core of most of health issues today.- Shift body from a state of “rest and digest” to a state of “fight and flight”, thus shutting down all digestive processes.- It can alter the ratio of good and bad gut bacteria and lead to dysbiosis, thereby dampening the immunity as 80% of the immunity lies in the gut. - Affect the production of hormones and neurotransmitters that are produced in the gut. A hormone called serotonin is a happy hormone and is made in the gut.- It can alter bowel movements and either result in watery stools or constipation.- Unmanaged stress can also result in behavioural changes when it comes to eating and make us binge eat, overeat or reach out for excess sugar, tea, coffee, fattening foods, fried foods that can further damage the gut.- Maintain a good probiotic ratio in the gut. One can focus on the intake of probiotics as well as prebiotics. This helps replenish the good bacteria in our gut and get rid of excess bad bacteria.-Practice deep breathing.-It is the quickest way to calm the mind and hence the gut.-It helps shift our body from a state of stress to a state of calm in a matter of a few deep breaths.-Add natural gut healers like pure cow ghee, coconut oil, omega 3 rich foods, L-glutamine, zinc, and selenium to your diet. Minerals like zinc play a vital role in keeping your intestinal lining healthy.Since stress is an inevitable part of life, the only precaution is to develop a better handle over stress by adopting effective stress management techniques. Deep breathing, yoga, meditation, gratitude practice, positive affirmations, visualisations, acceptance, sound therapy, art, are some of the best and most effective ways to manage stress levels on a day-to-day basis. Such stress-relieving activities should be practiced every day to ensure that your gut isn’t affected by the stressors you may encounter on a daily basis.By Luke CoutinhoHolistic Lifestyle Coach- Integrative Medicine",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73330508,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-244519/73330508.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/diet/gut-health-and-stress/articleshow/73330343.cms

Producer Siddharth P Malhotra replies, “Gaurav is joining the cast, but Namit’s character will be equally prominent. Gaurav’s entry will result in a love triangle between Surbhi Chandna , Gaurav and Namit’s characters. While Namit is a hustler, Gaurav will be seen as a principled and righteous man.

It’s not going anywhere for another three months.”Talking about his new project, Gaurav says, “Joining a show midway is 10 times tougher than associating with a project since its inception.

19,['19/01/2020'],Govt to revamp official data for clearer picture of economy,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Prime Minister Narendra Modi. (Reuters)

NEW DELHI: Faced with criticism over quality of data as well as allegations of manipulation, the government has begun discussions on a much-delayed revamp of official statistics, which have been at the centre of a political slugfest during the last few years.

The focus is to capture economic activity more accurately, particularly in the unorganised sector, and move to updated bases using the latest technology. The initiative came after a series of meetings by NITI Aayog , ministry of statistics and other government agencies revealed major gaps that need fixing immediately to improve the quality of official statistics.

There have been fierce political skirmishes over official data with opposition and a section of experts questioning the higher growth figures in the tenure of the Modi government. Former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramaniam claimed that GDP was actually 2.5 percentage points lower than the official figures. Though criticism tapered as official figures reflected a growth slowdown, and Subramaniam’s assertion was questioned, the government felt the need to take a long, hard look at official data.

For instance, much of the services activity – which accounts for over half of India’s gross domestic product (GDP) – is largely estimated on the basis of the output of organised sector entities making up just a little over quarter of the sector. Of the 11 lakh active Indian companies, seven lakh are engaged in services.

In case of transport and restaurants segments, the situation is worse as the estimated output is based on an assessment of 15% of the entities, again in the organised sector. “What is happening in dhabas and small eateries is not captured,” said an official source. In certain cases, such as sugar, production is calculated on average yield data which is over three decades old.

When it comes to calculating agriculture produce prices, agencies depend on “farm gate prices”, which government economists admit is faulty given that it is now possible to get mandi rates of various commodities, as data is available online and increasing digitalisation is making information available more easily.

Similarly, when measuring the price of water as an input for farm production, the government goes by the budget spending number instead of looking at electricity supply for running tubewells as a proxy.

While data with the ministry of corporate affairs is seen to be reliable in measuring organised sector activity, sources said, the picture is different when it comes to capital formation or several other financial parameters where numbers may be deficient. For instance, value of land or paid-up capital does not often capture the market value, especially when the entity has been in business for years.

Sources said that successive statisticians have failed to implement recommendations of the C Rangarajan committee, which submitted its report during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. While the idea is to use that as a starting point, including enacting a legislation for which a draft bill has been floated for public consultation, the government is expected to rope in the World Bank to use global best practices. Besides, the states will be an important partner in data collection with technology to be harnessed, said sources familiar with the discussions.

The Rangarajan committee had recommended these steps, while pointing out data gaps and duplication leading to conflicting statistics and delay in transmission and publication of data. But over the last 19 years, the government has failed to act on a bulk of the recommendations.

Pronab Sen, who was the country’s first chief statistician, blames lack of resources for some of the problems. “A substantial number of recommendations of the Rangarajan committee have been implemented,” said Sen, who later became chairman of the National Statistical Commission. “You need more manpower. Getting additional resources in the government is a major problem,” he added. Sen is now heading a panel set up to revamp statistics.

Asked whether there was an underestimation of GDP as a result of the outdated parameters, Sen said: “You have no idea which way the bias is.” Another former chief statistician, who did not wish to be quoted, said a significant number of recommendations of the Rangarajan Committee had been implemented but the actual number cannot be computed.

20,['19/01/2020'],Patna now has a unique air ambulance kiosk,"This story is from January 19, 2020

A view of Air Ambulance service at outside Jai Prakash Narayan International Airport in Patna on Saturday.

Patna airport — among the tiniest in the country and often in controversy for its dangerously short runway — now has a unique feature that even its larger counterparts can’t boast of. Jay Prakash Narayan International Airport is running a regular air ambulance service from a dedicated round-the-clock counter.

An air ambulance is a small plane loaded with specialised equipment, medication and a trained team which is used to ferry critically ill patients. But such is the growing demand for air ambulances in Bihar that one enterprising individual decided to offer the emergency service as a regular feature at the airport.

Anshu Aman, whose company operates the counter, told TOI on Saturday that up to 12 patients on average use the air ambulance service in Bihar per month. “I have seen people running from pillar to post to book air ambulance services and getting hassled with documentation. The idea is to provide a one-stop solution for those seeking such services,” he said.

The counter was inaugurated by Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey on Thursday while the Airports Authority of India has given its nod to similar counters at airports in Gaya and Ranchi, according to Aman.

One reason for the high demand for air ambulances to the national capital is that a number of super-specialty hospitals are located in and around Delhi. But it is also a reflection of the crumbling health infrastructure in Bihar. According to the National Health Profile 2019, the number of registered doctors in the state has increased by a mere 3,281 individuals between 2010 and 2018, with around 40,600 doctors in the state now. In 2018, Bihar reported 11,664 beds in 1,147 government hospitals. This would mean about 10 beds on average in each hospital to cater to a population of 10.41 crore (according to Census 2011).

D M Diwakar, professor of economics at Patna-based A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies, said that hospitals in the state lack doctors as well as infrastructure. “The Patna Medical College and Hospital suffers from an acute shortage of beds for patients, including in the ICUs.”

Dr Rajeev Ranjan Prasad, former superintendent of PMCH, admitted that Bihar lags in super-specialty hospitals equipped with the latest technology, advanced life support and crisis management services. He added this wasn’t the case only with Bihar. “Many of our cities lack the latest medical technology and manpower, thus patients are often recommended to large, multi-specialty hospitals in other regions.”

And yet, people in this low-income state are shelling out anywhere between Rs 4.8 lakh and Rs 6 lakh for air ambulances. At Patna airport, two bookings have already been made at the counter in the three days that it has been functional.

Mukesh Kumar, whose company also runs an air-ambulance service in Patna since 2011, added that the charges for renting the service have gone down in the past few years as more players entered the market. “The charges for air ambulance from Patna to Delhi were in the range of Rs7 lakh to Rs 8 lakh until a decade ago, but it now costs between Rs 4.75 lakh and Rs 5.75 lakh.”

Principal secretary (health department) Sanjay Kumar admitted that people often go to larger cities from Bihar to get treatment but added that this was because they have “sufficient purchasing power” and were choosing to do so. He said the health department also has a provision for sending people to other cities for advanced treatment through air ambulances.

Kumar added that a super-specialty hospital was being built at Kankerbagh in Patna while a Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital would be opened at Muzaffarpur and a cancer institute would come up at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna.

Can’t believe prof is absconding: CJ

HYDERABAD: Telangana police on Saturday arrested an associate professor of Osmania University from his official residence on the campus in an early morning raid in connection with a four-year-old Unlawful Activities Prevention Act case for alleged links with Maoist groups.The arrest of Ch Kaseem upset Telangana high court Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan, who warned of a CBI probe against police for detaining people unlawfully in various cases. Justice Chauhan, after hearing an urgent plea at his home on Saturday afternoon along with Justice A Abhishek Reddy, ordered the police chiefs of Hyderabad and Siddipet to produce the professor at his residence by 10.30am on Sunday. He also asked whether police had informed the vice-chancellor before entering the campus. While the petitioners claim no one was informed, police officers claimed they had informed the registrar.The CJ also asked what was the urgency in raiding the academic’s house when the case was four years old. Telangana counsel Harender Pershad told him that Kaseem had been on the run since the case was filed in 2016.Telangana special counsel Harender Pershad told the chief justice that Kaseem would be produced before a magistrate in Gajwel. The state also claimed that investigating officers had found more evidence now.“Has the detenue failed to respond to your notices? Did you give him any notice in the first place?” Justice Chauhan questioned.“A professor who is conducting classes for the last four years is now shown as absconding,” the CJ said. “This is unbelievable. You are doing this in many cases. If you do not produce him before us by tomorrow morning, we may have to think in terms of entrusting the matter to the CBI. We did so in Rajasthan in the past.”Since October 4 last year, Telangana police have arrested 17 people, including Kaseem, for alleged links with Maoists. Besides under UAPA, the professor has also been charged with sedition, attempt to wage war against the country and criminal conspiracy.Kaseem, an associate professor in the Telugu department, is also general secretary of Viplava Rachayitala Sangham, or the Revolutionary Writers’ Association. The association was once led by well-known Telugu writer Varavara Rao, currently in jail for his alleged involvement in the Elgar Parishad case in Maharashtra.At around 7am on Saturday, a police team from Siddipet led by Gajwel ACP Narayana reached the 43-year-old professor’s house with a search warrant. His wife, Snehalata, alleged that about 50 policemen forcibly entered their house by breaking open the rear door. “The case was filed at Mulugu police station in Siddipet district in 2016. We have seized incriminating evidence from the house,” Siddipet police commissioner Joel Davis said.In January 2016, one Shyam Sundar Reddy, who the police claim worked as a courier for Maoist groups, was arrested after a car he was driving hit and killed a girl at Mulugu. “After the accident, Shyam Sundar abandoned the car and fled. In the vehicle officials found incriminating evidence, including correspondence between Kaseem and the Maoist party leadership,” Davis claimed.Davis claimed that Kaseem had been collecting funds from the Maoist party’s central committee and using the money to organise meetings with various frontal organisations to propagate the party’s ideology.Snehalata alleged that her husband had been arrested for creating awareness about disparity, caste discrimination and unemployment in Telangana. “I appeal to the government to close the case and release him immediately,” she said.Retired professor and Civil Liberties Committee state president G Laxman, retired professor G Haragopal, convener of the Forum Against Repression, and other civil rights activists spoke at a meeting in the city to condemn the arrest.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73364732,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-662740,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/osmania-professor-held-for-maoist-links-cj-slams-police/articleshow/73364718.cms

Representational photo.

MUMBAI: Rising levels of air pollutants are a worry in winter, but fungus growing on the walls or air-conditioner ducts and/or pigeon droppings are a perennial cause for concern for lung health, say chest specialists.

Exposure to pigeon droppings was cited as one of the main causes for lung failure in two women — a 38-year-old from Borivli and a 68-year-old from Breach Candy — who recently underwent lung transplant at a hospital in central Mumbai.

""These women suffered from a condition called chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or environment-related lung fibrosis, for years,” said pulmonologist Unmil Shah. The medical history jotted down by Shah and other pulmonologists these patients visited over the years record that both reported pigeon droppings in the common duct areas of their building.

The Borivli patient, Hemali Shah, said her breathing problems started soon after she moved into a new home in 2012. “My sister who is a doctor noticed my breathing patterns were different and a pulmonary function test showed as much,” she said. Her family got the housing society to clean up the pigeon droppings in the duct “where our air-conditioning machine was fitted” and put up special nets and spikes, but the hypersensitive reaction Hemali suffered in 2012 had brought about lung-scarring that continued to worsen despite medicines over the years. She underwent a lung transplant on September 20, 2019 at Global Hospital in Parel.

Pulmonologist Sujeet Rajan said hypersensitivity pneumonitis is emerging as the most common cause for interstitial lung disease . “It accounts for almost 47% of all ILDs, with pigeon droppings as a very common cause, besides chronically damp environments seen in homes with cracked walls and leakages, recent renovation and plastering work, and close to construction sites,” added Dr Rajan.

Delayed diagnosis is one of the main problems with lung failure (interstitial lung disease), said doctors. “Around two lakh lung failure cases are identified every year in India alone, but there is little that can be done,” said heart and lung transplant surgeon Sandeep Attawar, who operated on Shah.

While lung transplants are not as common as kidney or heart transplants even in the West, there have been only a few hundreds or fewer lung transplants conducted in India. “There is little awareness about the fact that lung transplants are performed in India,” said Dr Attawar, who has conducted 124 lung transplants in the last 34 months.

The other patient, 68 years old, is among the oldest to be operated for double lung transplant. She too had similar exposure to pigeons in her building and was diagnosed to have progressive lung fibrosis and was dependent on oxygen support.

Dr Rajan said he sees at least six patients with interstitial lung disease every day at his clinic. “Half of them have chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis,” he added.

24,['19/01/2020'],Contractual workers also entitled to PF benefits: SC,"This story is from January 19, 2020

NEW DELHI: Holding that an employer cannot differentiate between contractual and permanent employees, the Supreme Court has ruled that casual workers are also entitled to social security benefits under the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act.

“As per Section 2(f) of the EPF Act, the definition of an employee is an inclusive definition, and is widely worded to include any person engaged either directly or indirectly in connection with the work of an establishment, and is paid wages,” a bench of Justices U U Lalit and Indu Malhotra said.

The order, which is essentially clarificatory, is part of the SC ’s directions to public sector unit Pawan Hans Limited to bring all contractual employees under its PF scheme and provide benefits from January 2017, when the workers’ union had approached court.

The apex court held Pawan Hans liable to pay a simple interest of 12% per annum on the amount payable by it towards PF contribution from January 2017 to December 2019.

Former labour secretary Shankar Agrawal said that labour laws do not discriminate between permanent and contractual employees and employers are mandated to give benefits under PF scheme, even when workers are engaged through other firms.

The labour reforms proposed by the government also include various benefits like health cover and PF for workers in the informal economy like “gig workers”, such as food delivery riders. The proposal is likely to be endorsed by Parliament’s standing committee on labour, which is examining the codes.

Of its 840 employees, the company engaged 570 on a regular basis, while 270 were contractual. The Centre had in 2001 issued a notification making the EPF Act applicable to aircraft or airline establishments employing 20 or more people but exempted government-owned airlines.

The bench, after examining the provisions of the act, said an organisation has to the pass twin conditions to be exempted under the law — the establishment must either belong to or be under the control of the government, and employees of such an establishment should be entitled to the benefit of contributory PF or old-age pension in accordance to any scheme or rule framed by the central or state governments.

The court said Pawan Hans failed to fulfil the second condition as it restricted the PF scheme to only regular employees. It said that since PF Trust regulations are in force and are applicable to all employees of the company, it would be preferable to direct that members of the union and other similarly situated contractual employees are granted the benefit of PF Trust regulations so that there is uniformity in service conditions of all the employees of the company.

26,['19/01/2020'],Not bullish! India plans to fix its cattle sex ratio,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: India has a skewed sex ratio problem. No, we’re not talking about humans but cattle. With bull numbers rising rapidly, especially after strict implementation of anti-cow slaughter laws, and no easy fixes in sight, the Centre now hopes to find a solution in ‘sexed semen’ (sex-sorted semen) technology to ensure birth of female calves through artificial insemination.

Besides limiting population of male cattle which often destroy standing crop, the ‘sexed semen’ technology will also help in increasing milk production — a key component of farmers’ income as they depend on dairy operations to supplement their farm earnings.

The ambitious artificial insemination programme, which aims to cover 1.2 crore cows, was launched by PM Narendra Modi in Mathura in September for 600 districts. Nearly, 17 lakh inseminations have already been done as part of this programme. Asked how many of them have been inseminated with ‘sexed semen’, secretary in department of animal husbandry & dairying (AHD), Atul Chaturvedi, said, “We are targeting 5% of insemination activities with sex-sorted semen. Though its coverage at present is very minimal, we are working to increase availability of sex-sorted semen and also subsiding the cost to an extent so that farmers are ready to pay the balance money.”

Noting that the sex-sorted technology is right now not indigenously available and expensive, Chaturvedi told TOI that farmers will not be willing to pay for it unless they find it profitable. “Many progressive farmers have, however, started bearing the cost of sex-sorted semen on their own,” he said.

The AHD secretary explained that unlike the 50:50 chances of male-female calf in normal conventional semen, the chances of having female calf would be over 90% with the use of sex-sorted semen. At present, there are two US-based companies — Genus ABS and Sexing Technologies (ST)—which have the technology. Unlike non-sexed semen, which is made available to farmers free, the cost of sexed semen can range from Rs 700 to Rs 1,200 per dose. Since farmers may end up using three doses to have a female calf, the high cost remains the biggest deterrent for small and medium farmers.

ABS India’s managing director, Arvind Gautam, however, argued that the returns of using sexed semen are much higher than their cost and that’s why “we are fully booked for the next few months”. There’s also a push to ‘make in India’. “We are now trying to set up labs across the country where sex-sorted semen can be produced using bulls in India. We have already set up 14,” said Chaturvedi.

The sanctioned semen production stations are located in Gujarat, Haryana , Kerala , Karnataka , Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, UP, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.

The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) is also currently involved in the sex-sorted semen project with the support of department of AHD. The board undertook a pilot project using sex-sorted semen from indigenous breeds like Sahiwal, Gir and Tharparkar in five districts — Amreli, Jodhpur, Purbi Champaran , Shahjahanpur and Varanasi. Till December last year, total 591 calves (522 female and 69 male) have been born with percentage of female calves at 88%.

“Although we have progressed considerably in genetic improvement of our livestock through artificial insemination, embryo transfer and in-vitro fertilization (IVF), we need to develop indigenous technology for semen-sexing. We also need to record other important traits like heat tolerance, disease resistance and feed efficiency in cattle to select better cattle using genomics,” said NDDB chairman Dilip Rath.

28,['19/01/2020'],Gudiya gang rape: 2 convicted for ‘extreme brutality’,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: Terming it a case of “exceptional depravity”, a Delhi court on Saturday convicted two men of gang-raping and brutalising a five-year-old at Gandhi Nagar in April 2013. The men had repeatedly inserted candles and bottles into the girl’s private parts and left her to die in a room from which she was rescued two days later. The court is likely to announce the quantum of punishment on January 30.

The incident occurred four months after the Nirbhaya rape-murder in December 2012, and came to be known in the media as the Gudiya case.

The accused, Manoj Shah (29) and Pradeep Kumar (26), were also held guilty of kidnapping, attempt to murder and unnatural sexual act. While being escorted out of the courtroom, accused Manoj attacked mediapersons and slapped a woman journalist.

While pronouncing the judgment, additional sessions judge (ASJ) Naresh Kumar Malhotra observed, “In our society, minor girls are worshipped as goddesses on certain occasions but in the present case, the victim child...had experienced exceptional depravity and extreme brutality…The collective conscience of the community was shaken.”

Soon after the judgment, the survivor’s father said he was happy justice had been delivered. “This could have been completed in just two years but it took them almost seven years.”

The incident had happened on April 15, when ‘Gudiya’ by the media later was kidnapped from her house by the two men and locked up in a room nearby. The parents of the girl had approached the police who refused to take a complaint and instead asked the family members to look for the girl themselves.

The girl was finally recovered 40 hours later from Manoj’s room after a neighbour heard her cries. She had several injuries and a bottle and three pieces of candle shoved into her private parts. Her neck had strangulation marks as well as a slit mark.

The trial took an interesting turn in 2014 when one of the accused, Pradeep, moved court claiming he was a juvenile at the time of his arrest. The trial court took three years to decide his application and on April 12, 2017, transferred the case to Juvenile Justice Board (JJB). Pradeep was granted bail by the JJB in June.

Following this, the mother of the rape survivor moved Delhi High Court against the trial court's order. In 2018, the high court declared that Pradeep was not a juvenile and sent him to trial before the sessions court.

The judgment which is yet to be made public, is learnt to have given credence to the prosecution’s circumstantial evidence and material evidences lifted from Manoj’s room where the survivor was found. Accused Manoj was traced through electronic surveillance and arrested from Muzaffarpur on April 19. The bloodstained clothes recovered from the room matched with him. A key in his pocket also matched the lock on the door of his room, as per sources.

As per the prosecution, when Manoj was arrested, he put the onus of the crime on Pradeep who was also arrested from Darbhanga in Bihar on April 21. Before fleeing, Manoj who is also known as Raj, gave him a piece of paper with a number and ‘Raj’ written on it to communicate. The diary from which the paper was torn belonged to Manoj and was recovered from him, besides this the forensic examination revealed that the paper slip was torn from the very same diary and the handwriting analysis matched with Manoj’s writing.

Virender Verma, lawyer for the survivor, said “We are happy that the judge pronounced them guilty but on the other hand, what accused Manoj did to a woman journalist when he was being taken out of the courtroom is shameful. It is sad to see the accused do such a thing even after being convicted. We will now press for life imprisonment for the accused.”

Chandrashekhar Tyagi, Pradeep’s lawyer, refused to comment.

Though the chargesheet was filed by the Delhi police on May 24, 2013 against the two accused — Manoj Shah and Pradeep Kumar— and charges were framed against them by the court on July 11 the same year, it took more than five years to complete recording of the statement of 56 plus 3 other prosecution witnesses in a Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) court.

29,['19/01/2020'],Sanskrit to replace Urdu at Uttarakhand stations,"This story is from January 19, 2020

DEHRADUN: The railway authorities have decided to replace Urdu language on signboards at state platforms with Sanskrit. The signboards which have names of railway stations written in Hindi, English and Urdu will now be written in Hindi, English and Sanskrit.

According to railway officials, the decision has been taken as per provisions of the Railway Manual, which says that names of the railway stations should be written in Hindi, English and in the second language of the state. In 2010, the Uttarakhand government had become the first in the country to give Sanskrit the status of second official language of the Himalayan state. The then chief minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank had said that he intended to promote Sanskrit in the state. Himachal Pradesh followed suit in 2019.

The order to this effect was issued by Moradabad railway division after a local neta pointed this out, said officials. Deepak Kumar, chief public relations officer, Northern Railway, told TOI, “As per the railway manuals, the names of railway stations are to be written on signboards in the state’s second language other than Hindi and English.”

Asked why it took the railways a decade to decide on this, Kumar said, “Earlier, Urdu was used on signboards since Uttarakhand was part of UP where Urdu is the second language. We are now making the change after someone pointed this out.”

Rekha Sharma, senior divisional commercial manager (DCM), said, “It was pointed out to us recently that Sanskrit is the second language of Uttarakhand. Hence, names of railway stations should be in Sanskrit too. However, it is a daunting task for us to know how the names of cities will be written in Sanskrit.”

SK Agarwal from the commerce and tax department at Dehradun railways said, “We have written to all the district magistrates of Uttarakhand where railway stations exist to give us the right spellings of their railway stations in Hindi, English and Sanskrit. We are awaiting their replies.”

A local Sanskrit teacher, however, pointed out the names of railway stations in Hindi and Sanskrit will mostly be the same but for an ‘m’-sound in the end since both languages use a common Devanagari script. “So, Dehradun will become Dehradunam, Haridwar Haridwaram and Roorkee Roorkeeh,” he added.

The names of railway stations which will be changed from Urdu to Sanskrit are Dehradun, Haridwar, Roorkee, Laksar , Raiwala, Doiwala , Rishikesh , to name a few.

32,['19/01/2020'],Bhushan firm promoter's Rs 204 crore assets attached,"This story is from January 19, 2020

NEW DELHI: Currently in jail, Bhushan Power & Steel promoter Sanjay Singal faced another setback on Friday when the Enforcement Directorate attached his assets worth over Rs 204 crore in a money laundering case, taking the total attached assets so far to Rs 4,230 crore. The agency also filed a chargesheet against him and 24 others in a Delhi court which has taken cognisance of it.

The agency has accused Singal of diverting bank funds out of loans taken by Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd from 33 banks and financial institutions during 2007-2014 which were used for creation of assets, including equity investment in BPSL and properties in Delhi and London in the name of firms controlled by Singal. ED has identified assets worth over Rs 4,229.54 crore and provisionally attached them under PMLA. Further probe is on.

The 23 others accused in the money laundering case are entry operators based in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata who had provided accommodation entries to Singal, facilitating the process of money-laundering, ED said. Singal was arrested by ED on November 22 last year and has been in judicial custody. ""Investigations under Prevention of Money Laundering Act had revealed that an amount of Rs 204.31 crore was diverted out of bank loan funds of BPSL, which were utilised for acquisition of assets in India and abroad by Sanjay Singal,"" ED said in its attachment order. The ED had registered a PMLA case against Singal and BPSL based on an FIR by CBI dated April 5, 2019.

ED has accused Singal and others of criminal conspiracy. ""They did not use bank funds for the purpose for which they were sanctioned, committed forgery for the purpose of cheating, used forged documents and falsified accounts causing wrongful loss to the lending banks, financial institutions, government exchequer and corresponding wrongful gain to themselves,"" ED said.

33,['19/01/2020'],It’s tempting to think that justice is served by hanging some ‘bad apples’,"In a flawed criminal justice system, the burden of death penalty falls on the poorest and most marginalised sections of society, says Anup Surendranath, executive director of Project 39A at National Law University who has spent years researching and interviewing inmates on death row. Ahead of the Nirbhaya hangings, he tells Sunday Times that the system fails both victims and accused equally

After seven years, the convicts in the 2012 gang-rape case were handed down death warrant recently. Many people feel that justice will be done only when these men are hanged on February 1. Do you agree?



After cases of gang-rape or child sexual assault, we often hear cries of outrage and demand for exemplary punishment ranging from castration to hanging. Do you think severity of punishment acts as a deterrent?



Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru had claimed that he was tortured and set up by the recently arrested J&K cop Davinder Singh. Your own research has thrown light on the lax policing system where confessions have been coerced. Can you elaborate?



The standard in levying death penalty in India has been 'rarest of rare' cases but that is interpreted differently by different judges. What has your research shown?

A principle in the criminal justice system is that the severity of the punishment should not be greater than the gravity of the crime. But what about those who are found innocent after long years of incarceration?



Do you think convicts land up on death row less due to the heinousness of crime and more from extraneous social circumstances?



What are the systemic changes required to ensure that our criminal justice system can be rid of this inherent bias?



I have no doubt that for a vast number of people, justice would necessarily mean hanging the four convicts. And I suppose that would be even more so for Asha Devi and Badrinath Singh (Nirbhaya’s parents). One can certainly understand these reactions. While it is difficult for any society to confront such uncomfortable truths, it is tempting to want to assert that we, as a society, are not responsible. Sexual violence is a product of various social, cultural, and economic dynamics and we would be misleading ourselves if we thought it is just about some ‘bad apples’ in our midst.Rather than the severity of punishment, it is the certainty of punishment that is likely to be a deterrent. We have a criminal justice system that is in severe crisis. It is a system burdened with archaic policing and investigating practices that routinely indulges in torture, wrongful prosecutions and manipulation of evidence. At the same time, victims of crime also struggle to file cases, get them appropriately investigated and prosecuted. We have a system that fails both victims and accused equally.Torture is an integral part of our investigation methods and unfortunately our Evidence Act permits the use of torture-based evidence indirectly. Our police and investigation agencies suffer from an acute lack of modernisation. Our lack of police reforms incentivises the use of torture and world-over we have seen the unreliability of torture-based evidence. I do not think we have even scratched the surface on wrongful prosecutions in India. Initiatives like the Innocence Project in the US have shown the extent of innocent people being convicted and punished. Unfortunately, in India, we barely acknowledge the phenomenon of wrongful convictions in our crisis-ridden criminal justice system.The Supreme Court has itself in various judgments expressed grave concern about the arbitrariness with which the 'rarest of the rare' doctrine has been applied. The 40-year history of using the 'rarest of rare' doctrine is rife with inconsistency and has been extremely judge-centric. The search for consistent principles in the SC's death penalty jurisprudence is a futile one. The Law Commission of India has also flagged this concern extensively. The 'rarest of rare’ doctrine as a judicial standard has completely broken down and is barely recognisable.The Akshardham case is a perfect example. Three individuals were acquitted by the Supreme Court in May 2014 after being in prison for 11 years, nine of them on death row. While acquitting them the court explicitly noted that they were innocent and that the investigating agencies had deliberately framed them. But the court rejected their plea for compensation and said that this would ‘open the floodgates’. That is a shocking admission by the SC where it is essentially saying that if they gave compensation to these innocent people, it would have to give the same to many more similarly situated people. The state of our criminal justice system must really worry us.Like in all countries that have the death penalty, the burden of the death penalty in India falls on the poorest and the most marginalised sections of our society. We have empirically shown this through the Death Penalty India Report 2016. Death row prisoners receive terrible legal representation and everyone in the system knows that. These are not people who can ensure that their cases are fought properly and that procedural protections are strictly adhered to.We are playing with fire by using death penalty in a criminal justice system like ours. Ours is not a system that is capable of ensuring the highest standards of fair trial and due process. In addition to that, crime in our society is a particularly complex phenomenon. It might be comfortable to think that it is ‘bad people’ that commit crimes and just not worry about how society and state produce crime. It is the poor that always face the harshest treatment by the state in terms of punishment and criminal law. Removing that bias requires a social transformation that is so deep and so profound that it is barely imaginable from where we stand today.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73361962,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1285407,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/its-tempting-to-think-that-justice-is-served-by-hanging-some-bad-apples/articleshow/73361651.cms

NEW DELHI: The government has said lawyers are exempt from service tax and there is no move to impose the levy on them for providing legal services .

The response came after some lawyers raised the issue with the finance ministry following notices from tax authorities. Sources said some of the lawyers, who had received notices for divergence between their income tax and service tax returns, had registered as service tax payers. ""There is a possibility that they may have provided other services since there are chartered accountants who are also qualified lawyers and provide consultancy services,"" said an official. In such cases, the service provider has to respond to the notices.

The tax department has issued notices related to short or non-payment of service tax for financial years 2015-16 and 2016-17, leading to some of the lawyers practising in Delhi and Mumbai flagging their concerns to the finance ministry.

Lawyers were exempted from paying service tax and enjoy the same status under GST regime. Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs said it appears that such service tax notices have been issued only to assessees registered with the department for the purpose of paying service tax. As per law, advocates are exempt from paying service tax for services rendered to individuals.

SRINAGAR: The director general (DGP) of J&K's 85,000-strong police force has been divested of all powers to deploy cops in the Union Territory . These powers will now be vested with the Centre, a government order (GO) issued by the UT's general administration department said.

Henceforth, transfer of station house officers (SHOs), which used to be done by superintendents of police (SPs), will be executed by lieutenant governor (LG) Girish Chandra Murmu's adviser Rajeev Rai Bhatnagar, in consultation with special security adviser (SSA) to the ministry of home affairs (MHA) Vijay Kumar. Earlier, the practice was that the DGP could transfer anyone below the rank of SP, while postings of SPs and above ranks were done by the Cabinet or the state advisory board, in consultation with the police chief, keeping in mind requirements for anti-militancy operation and needs at the district level.

Though DGP Dilbagh Singh was unavailable for comments on the development, the ""impugned order"", which came just three days after deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Davinder Singh was arrested along with two terrorists on January 11, has created a sense of consternation in the police force.

""This will take away discipline from the force as its chief can no longer effect even the transfer of an SHO without the approval of the LG's advisor and the SSA of the home minister in Delhi,"" said a police officer on condition of anonymity.

Senior Congress politician and MP Kapil Sibal said on Saturday that no state government can take the stand that it will not implement CAA .

Speaking at a Kerala Literature Festival session, Sibal said “if CAA is passed no state can say we will not implement it. That is not possible, that is unconstitutional”.

“You can oppose it, you can pass a resolution asking the central government to withdraw it, but to say I will not implement it is problematic. What we can do is to politically get together and fight it,” Sibal said.

His unambiguous view comes as a shot in the arm for the Kerala governor who has over the last few days been engaged in a war of words with the LDF government which has been consistently claiming that it “won’t implement CAA”.

CHENNAI: DMK president M K Stalin and TNCC chief K S Alagiri on Saturday called a truce after a 30-minute meeting at the DMK headquarters in Chennai. The meeting comes in the wake of recent hard-hitting statements by senior leaders of the two parties on alliance issues, including sharing of seats in the just-concluded rural local body elections .

Stalin later urged both party leaders to refrain from making public statements on alliance matters. He said there was no strain in the alliance and all issues have been resolved. Alagiri said the alliance was strong as ever and will continue for the 2021 assembly elections as well.

The DMK-led alliance won in the rural local body elections for which district-level leaders were asked to discuss seat-sharing with allies, Stalin said in a party press release soon after the meeting. ""Except in some areas where there were certain problems between the two parties, in all others, the alliance won. But I request both party leaders to stop speaking on this issue. There is no rift in the alliance,"" he said.

Stalin said the issue became public after a statement was issued by Alagiri where he referred to DMK not adhering to coalition dharma in the civic polls. After this, leaders of both parties began debating publicly on it. ""Now, Alagiri himself has said there are no differences between the parties. In today's meeting, he clarified that Congress will continue to be with DMK in opposing anti-secular parties. I don't want any more debate on this by both party leaders,"" said Stalin.

Talking to reporters after the meeting, Alagiri began on a lighter vein saying Stalin greeted him by asking him if he had watched Rajinikanth-starrer 'Darbar' and told him that he himself liked it.

It all began when Alagiri and Congress legislature chief K R Ramasamy criticised DMK for not sharing a reasonable number of seats in the rural local bodies polls and asked if it was 'coalition dharma'. Following this, DMK boycotted the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act meeting convened by Congress in New Delhi.

On January 15, DMK treasurer S Durai Murugan said the Congress could leave the alliance if it wanted to and its exit won't affect the DMK's prospects in future elections. Congress MP from Virudhunagar Manickam Tagore criticised Durai Murugan and said if DMK did not want Congress as its ally, it should look for alternatives.

Tender Hearts International School students rehearse for human chain formation on Saturday

PATNA: The state is geared up to break its own record and form the longest human chain of the world from 11.30am to 12 noon on Sunday. The human chain, third of its kind in the state, is being formed this time at the behest of CM Nitish Kumar to promote the state government’s Jal Jivan Hariyali campaign and prohibition as well as to garner people’s support against dowry and child marriage.

The human chain is targeted to be 16,200km-long, 20% longer than the previous one. The first human chain (11,285km) was formed in 2017 in favour of prohibition and the second human chain (13,660km) in 2018 against dowry and child marriage. The government is expecting participation of around four crore people in the human chain this time.

With just a day left for the mega event, authorities of all districts were busy giving final touches to the preparations on Saturday. Micro level monitoring of the preparation was done and stages were made at different venues.

“One person has been given the charge of 1km. There will be at least 2,000 people standing in 1km length,” said Vinodanand Jha, director of training and research directorate of education department.

“To make the event colourful, stages are being set up. Rangolis are also being made. Banners have been prepared using bamboo and paper. There will be two banners in a stretch of 1km. Songs based on environment have been composed especially for this event. These songs will be played at different places on Sunday,” Jha added.

He said people associated with Limca Book of Records and India Book of Records have already reached the state to document the programme.

At Gandhi Maidan , the epicentre of the event where Nitish will inaugurate the event and participate in it, all necessary arrangements have been made. Patna DM Kumar Ravi said there will be medical camps and water tanks at a distance of every 1km.

Schools, both government as well as private, were busy with rehearsals on Saturday. Private Schools and Children Welfare Association president Syed Shamael Ahmad said 20 lakh students studying in different schools under the association will take part in the human chain. “The human chain is for a good cause and children have been exhorted to participate in it actively,” he said.

Bihar Chambers of Commerce and Industries has also appealed to the businessmen to participate in the human chain.

VARANASI: Union minister Smriti Irani said it was well known till now that Congress party was anti-Hindi and anti-Sikh, but it has now proved to have become anti-Christian also by opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Addressing BJP cadres and supporters at Sampurnanand Sanskrit University ground in Varanasi on Saturday, Irani said, “Congress chief Sonia Gandhi never made any comment when places of worship of Christians were attacked in Pakistan, although she had time to shed tears on Batla House encounter. Nobody knew that Congress will also stand against Christians just like it always used to be against Hindus and Sikhs.”

“The massacre of Kashmiri Pandits and brutalities against them in Kashmir had started on January 19, 1990 and it is a coincidence that I am addressing this rally on the eve of such an unfortunate date. The cries of the families, women and girls, who were raped and forced to convert and marry, in Pakistan for being minority were never heard by Congress.”

Questioning Congress leaders for opposing CAA , she said former PM Manmohan Singh and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gahlot supported granting citizenship to minorities from Pakistan, who had taken shelter in India.

“Congress is opposing CAA now just because PM Narendra Modi gave a helping hand to the minorities facing persecution in neighbouring countries,” she said.

She asked the Congress to explain why it is sympathetic towards Pakistan by promoting mobs to attack police and damage public property.

Targeting Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra without taking her name, Irani said, “A parachute politician had come to Varanasi to protest against CAA but showed her dual character when she was seen performing namaz in Bareilly after offering prayers at a temple in Varanasi. During 2019 Lok Sabha elections, she kept asking people when they asked her to do so.”

Slamming Rahul Gandhi for his remarks against Savarkar, Irani said he can’t match his courage even after taking 10 births.

“Rahul Gandhi recently said he will not apologize, since he is not Rahul Savarkar. I want to tell Rahul Gandhi today that you will not be able to match the courage of Savarkar even after you take 10 births,” she said.

44,['19/01/2020'],Abhay Chhajed asks deputy CM to not scrap HCMTR plan,"This story is from January 19, 2020

<p>Ajit Pawar <br></p>

PUNE: The state Congress general secretary and former corporator, Abhay Chhajed , has advised deputy chief minister and district guardian minister Ajit Pawar against scrapping the High-Capacity Mass Transit Route (HCMTR) project.

In a letter to Pawar, Chhajed — a former city Congress president — said the 24-metre HCMTR was vital to easing the city’s mounting traffic problems and claimed it would also improve the public transport scenario.

At a review meeting on Friday, Pawar had asked Pune Municipal Corporation to study the ‘Metro Neo’ option as an alternative on the HCMTR’s alignment. ‘Metro Neo’ — a hybrid of Metro, tram, bus and BRTS — runs on rubber tyres and is powered by overhead electrical cables.

Chhajed, in the letter, said he was in favour of the HCMTR project — an elevated “inner ring road” with 8m wide lanes for public buses, with the rest dedicated to private vehicles. The route will be connected to most of the areas in the city. “The road will help bigger vehicles to travel faster, reducing the burden on the existing roads. The Execution of HCMTR is necessary for the city. A proposal to replace HCMTR with Metro Neo will defeat the purpose of a high-capacity elevated road,” Chhajed stated in the letter.

To make his case, Chhajed cited the examples of the Eastern and Western Express Highways in Mumbai and claimed that these facilities have proved vital to speeding up the movement of vehicles and reducing traffic congestion.

PMC has initiated tenders for the HCMTR project, but has yet to allot the work, as the tender applications were received at an inflated cost. The HCMTR project was proposed in city’s 1987 development plan (DP). The project was a part of the 2017 DP as well.

Wedding card of MLC Ritlal Yadav’s daughter

PATNA: Wedding cards with ‘no gifts please’ messages are common enough, but here’s a card with an explosive message for the guests— ‘please don’t bring in any weapons’.

This unusual request message is printed on the wedding cards of Bihar MLC Ritlal Yadav ’s daughter, who is set to get married on February 4 at the family’s residence in Kothwa village in Danapur on the outskirts of Patna.

The don-turned-politician is currently in Beur jail for his alleged involvement in a double murder case and has applied for bail to attend his daughter’s wedding.

“Yah suchna kewal kuchh logon ke liye hai, dusre logon par lagoo nahi hoga,” says a close aide of the MLC, who is a former mukhiya of Kothwa.

Sources say at least two dozen cases of murder, extortion and kidnapping are lodged against Yadav, who was elected as an MLC from behind bars.

According to a family member, Yadav has been given a 14-day provisional bail by the Patna High Court and he would be released after furnishing a bond of Rs 50,000 on January 25 to take part in his daughter’s wedding.

Beur jail superintendent Jawahar Lal Prabhakar said, “Though I have heard about his provisional bail, I have not yet received any order from the high court. Once the order comes to my office we will release him after completing the legal formalities.”

Yadav’s name had also figured in the killing of BJP MLA from Danapur Asha Devi’s husband Satyanarayan Sinha in 2003. His supporters had created a ruckus outside the residence of RJD chief Lalu Prasad for denial of ticket to him. “Lalu ji then kept his promise and paved the way for getting him elected as MLC,” says a die-hard supporter of the jailed politician.

DARBHANGA: The Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University (KSDSU) senate approved a Rs 591.62 crore deficit budget for the 2020-21 fiscal on Saturday.

The budgetary proposal, which was presented by pro-vice-chancellor (VC) C P Singh at a meeting held under the presidentship of VC Sarvnarayan Jha, entailed an annual expenditure of Rs 594.32 crore and an income of Rs 2.61 crore only.

The VC claimed that the university had succeeded in regularizing the academic session, holding fair examinations, conducting research activities as per the guidelines of the University Grants Commission and introducing choice-based credit system.

“Since students from different parts of the state study here, it is not easy for the passouts to come back for their certificates and marksheets after they are employed. We, therefore, signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Academic Depository (NAD) so that all examination-related documents are stored at one place,” Jha said and added that companies hiring KSDSU students could verify their certificates on the NAD website.

The VC also pointed out that the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan had provided Rs 20 crore for the first time for the renovation of old buildings in KSDSU.

The diamond unit in Surat’s Gotalawadi where the theft occurred on Thursday

Surat: Two employees of a well-known diamond company located under the jurisdiction of Katargam police station in the city were on Friday booked for alleged theft of Rs3.5 crore worth of polished diamonds. Police said the employees, among the trusted ones , were employed in the company for the last 15 years.

Raju Luhar, a resident of Lal Darwaja, and Prakash Kunwar, a resident of Mahidharpura, allegedly stole 1,300 carats of polished diamonds from H.Vinod Kumar (HVK) diamond company located at Gotalawadi in Katargam on Thursday evening.

According to the complaint filed by Hitesh Vaghasia, manager of HVK diamonds, the parcel of 1,300 carats of polished diamonds was given to Raju Luhar for boiling process. After polishing work is completed, the diamonds are kept in boilers for cleaning purpose. Luhar came out of the boiling room located on the second floor of the factory at about 7.30pm and handed over the keys of the locked room to the manager of the second floor, Dipak Vadhel.

On Friday morning at about 8.30am, Dipak Vadhel heard the alarm from the boiling room. He went inside the boiling room to discover that the diamonds that were given to Luhar were missing. The manager inquired about Luhar in the factory, but was told that he has not reported for duty.

The manager called up on his mobile number but found both his numbers were switched off. On checking CCTV footage, it was found that Luhar had removed the diamonds from the packets and kept the empty boiler equipment on the machine and went outside the factory carrying his tiffin box.

Kolkata: Residents of Park Circus have demanded sound barriers be installed along the link arm of the connection between Maa and AJC Bose Road flyover for two reasons — to mute the noise from traffic and to prevent people from chucking plastic waste into the homes right next to the ramp.

The local traffic guard has been approached and cops said they have decided to approach Lalbazar in this regard. KMDA — which had earlier decided to install six-feet-high view cutters — has said that there was a “minor delay” as some “technical details” are being worked out. “We have gone ahead with erecting view cutters on Garden Reach flyover. But here, a couple of issues, including the material to be used, is being worked out,” said an official.

The development comes almost a year after Kolkata traffic police had proposed the installation of nets, view cutters and advanced crash barriers on the southern flank of Maa.

People protects themselves from cold near roadside a bonfire in Patna. (File photo)

PATNA: Overcast conditions are likely to continue in the state on Sunday, but meteorologists have claimed that the cloud cover will be cleared by the evening. This, in turn, will lead to a plunge in the mercury column and a dense fog cover from Monday.

The daily weather bulletin issued by the Patna Meteorological Centre on Friday stated that moderate rainfall took place in some parts over north-west Bihar and light showers occurred at few places, except south-central and south-east Bihar during the past 24 hours.

Private weather agency, Skymet Weather, also reported on Saturday that light rain and thundershowers were recorded at some places over Bihar and adjoining parts of north Jharkhand in 24 hours. There was also dense fog at one or two places during the early morning hours.

Skymet attributed the rainy conditions to presence of a cyclonic circulation over the northern parts of Uttar Pradesh. It also stated that another cyclonic circulation was being seen over northern parts of Chhattisgarh region.

“Since these systems are moving east-northeastwards slowly, a light spell of rain and thundershower will continue at scattered places over Bihar and Jharkhand,” the Skymet report said.

The private weather agency claimed that places like East Champaran, West Champaran, Chhapra, Siwan, Sitamarhi, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Supaul, Kishanganj, Purnia, Patna, Aurangabad, Lakhisarai and Gaya, among others, were likely to witness showers.

“Some places may even witness hailstorm activities. These weather activities are likely to prevail for the next 36 to 48 hours. As time progresses, the rainfall activities will decrease,” the Skymet report stated.

It added, “Due to the presence of moisture conditions, there are chances of formation of a dense fog layer engulfing Bihar and adjoining parts of north Jharkhand. After 18 to 24 hours, the fog layer will intensify and the night temperature decrease gradually.”

Officials at the Patna Meteorological Centre also claimed that the temperature was likely to fall from Monday.

“Cold westerly winds, which started blowing from Saturday evening, will lead to a dip in the temperature as soon as the cloud cover clears by Sunday evening. It may also be followed by a dense fog cover in the morning hours,” an official at the local Met centre said.

Representative image

AGRA: Around 10 localities suffered inadequate water supply on Saturday due to leakage in the main supply pipe near Jeevani Mandi water works station. The Jal Sansthan has not been able to put a tab on leakages in the water supply pipelines.

Jal Sansthan officials have been making temporary arrangements to stop leakages. However, no permanent solution has been made. Meanwhile, several localities received foul-smelling water supply on Saturday.

Senior councillor Ravi Mathur said, “The 28mm main supply pipe connected to the Jeevani Mandi water works station suffers frequent leakages. The Jal Sansthan administration has not been able to provide a permanent solution even after much delay.”

The areas where water supply was affected on Saturday are Jeevani Mandi, Kala Mahal, Peepal Mandi, Baluganj, Kacheri Ghat, Pathwari, Dhuliyaganj, Gudri Mansoor Khan, Rawatpara, Chipitola and Awas Vikas.

General manager of Jal Sansthan RS Yadav said, “Repair work of the main pipeline connected to Jeevani Mandi has been initiated. Adequate water supply will be ensured from Sunday onwards.”

According to the sources, frequent leakages in the pipeline take place due to lack of maintenance. More than 12 major leakages in water supply pipelines, maintained by Jal Sansthan, are causing wastage of water in different parts of the city on a daily basis.

As per an estimate, atleast 50 million litres (MLD) of water is wasted in the city due to pipeline leakages. The leakages have only increased in the past two years. So far, Jal Sansthan has not been able to devise a city-wide plan to curb the situation.

For supply of treated water, city depends on river Yamuna which gets water discharge from Gokul barrage. According to Jal Sansthan officials, compared to the demand of 1500 cusecs per day, around 1000 cusecs of water is being discharged in the river from Gokul barrage since past two months. It has resulted in the water level reaching close to the minimum level of 480 feet. This is also one of the reasons of inadequate supply of water in various localities of the city.

Water supply in old city areas is dependent on Jeevani Mandi water works whereas nearly half of the city gets water supply from Sikandra water works. The pipelines connected to the Jeevani Mandi water works are in a hapless state.

The main points where leakages happen are Jeevani Mandi Road, Transport Nagar, Kailash road, Balkeshwar Locality and Ghatia Azam Khan, Belanganj, Daresi, Rawatpara, Noori Darwaza, Idgha, Trans-Yamuna localities.

The focus of the institute is to provide academic excellence to kids. Of four common service centres, one is dedicated to meditation, yoga, and indoor sports while the other centres would provide basic facilities like food material, vegetables, bank counters/ATMs, laundry, spa and courier among other things.

“There would also be one agro-ecological farm. The whole campus will be eco-friendly as most area would be green. The campus will be earthquake resistant,” he said.

KOLKATA: The Philippino who had developed chest pain mid-air, leading to the aircraft making an emergency landing in Kolkata on Wednesday, underwent a craniotomy on Friday after the patient’s wife gave consent to the surgery . Doctors at Charnock Hospital , where Ramos Virgilio, 44, is undergoing treatment, said the patient is recovering.The Dubai-bound flight from Manila was diverted to Kolkata after Virgilio complained of chest pain and uneasiness. After a medical team at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport checked him, the patient was rushed to the hospital on VIP Road where doctors found he had suffered a stroke. Investigations in the hospital revealed Virgilio had suffered two strokes — haemorrhagic and ischemic — because of which there was bleeding in the brain while the main artery on the right side had stopped supplying blood to the brain.Initially, he was conscious and alert and doctors kept managing him with medication. However, despite medication, when Virgilio’s condition did not improve, doctors decided to go for a repeat CT scan. This time they found the swelling in the brain had increased.“Ultimately, we had to conduct a craniotomy to release pressure on the brain,” said Rohit Mishra, the neurosurgeon who conducted the surgery. The hospital management, however, had a tough time convincing Virgilio’s wife Loraine in Manila that he needed to undergo immediate surgery. Loraine refused to consent to the surgery in a foreign country. That is when the hospital decided to make a video call and show her his condition. The hospital also consulted the Philippines consulate. On Friday, doctors explained why Virgilio had to be operated on immediately, and Loraine finally agreed.“The insurance agency, however, refused to pay. But saving the man’s life was the need for the hour. We could not have delayed the surgery over finances,” said Prashant Sharma, managing director, Charnock Hospital.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73371470,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-119190,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/philippines-flyer-undergoes-skull-surgery-at-city-hospital/articleshow/73363178.cms

PATNA: The East Central Railway (ECR) is likely to throw open newly built Kosi rail bridge for traffic by the end of February-March this year. The bridge, which was badly damaged in the 1943 earthquake, had been closed much to the inconvenience of people.

ECR GM L C Trivedi, who conducted annual inspection of the Saharsa- Mansi and Khagaria-Samastipur routes under Samastipur division on Friday, said railways has targeted to run passenger trains up to Saraigarh in the current fiscal, thus paving way to run passenger trains on Supaul-Saraigarh route extending up to Nirmali by the end of this year.

Trivedi said railways has also planned to lay new lines between Supaul and Araria. “The Railway Board has approved the proposal and efforts are on to acquire land for the execution of this ambitious project. Rail electrification work is being carried out in full swing on each route of the newly laid broad gauge rail lines under Sonepur and Samastipur divisions in north Bihar region.

The GM visited Sonebarsa Kachari station where he inspected station premises and availability of passenger amenities. He also inspected railway crossing gate numbers 22, 24 and the track condition between Sonebarsa Kachari and Simri Bakhtiyarpur. He later visited Olapur, Salauna and Dr Krishna Singh Nagar stations and took first-hand information about passenger amenities available at these roadside stations, ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said.

The GM thoroughly inspected the condition of the Burhi Gandak rail bridge located between Rosera Ghat and Narhan station. At Samastipur, the GM inaugurated a newly built hall at the Samastipur’s DRM office and held discussions with senior officials of the division.

Meanwhile, railways has granted temporary stoppage to Rajendra Nagar Terminal-New Tinsukhiya Express (13281/13282) at New Cooch Behar station from Saturday to facilitate passengers either boarding or alighting from the train at this station, the CPRO said.

Minister Pratap Chandra Sarangi addresses media on Saturday.

SURAT: Pratap Chandra Sarangi , Union minister of state for MSME , animal husbandry , dairying and fisheries , on Friday stated that those who do not accept India’s ‘azadi, akhandata and Vande Matram’ have no right to live in this country.

Sarangi was in the city to attend an interactive session on MSME organized by Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) on Friday.

Talking to media persons on Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Sarangi said, “CAA is an act of atonement for their sin of dividing the country before Independence. They must congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi for washing off their sins. Those who do not accept India’s azadi, akhandata and Vande Mataram have no right to live in this country.”

Sarangi said, “CAA should have be been implemented 70 years ago. The country was divided on communal lines and not politically, geographically or economically. We are living with Muslims since ages and never said we don’t want to live with them.”

Coming down heavily on Congress, Sarangi said, “They formed the two-nation theory. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was roped in to initiate talks and reach a settlement. Partition was unaffordable. This country is not anyone’s property. Congress is igniting fire in the country in the name of CAA. They should congratulate us for washing off their sins. They (Congress) are doing this as they are on verge of extinction”

Sarangi stated that during Independence, there were 2.5 crore Muslims in the country. At present, Muslim population is more than 23 crore. On the other hand, Hindu population in Pakistan has decreased from 23% to 3% and Bangladesh from 28% to 7%.

“Hindus were forced to leave Pakistan and Bangladesh due to mass killings and to save their religion. Thus, minorities who have come from other countries due to communalism have right to live in India. CAA provides Hindus , Jains, Christians, Buddhists and Parsees right to live in this country,” the minister added.

Initially, they were given a deadline of January 10 to give a reply, which was extended to January 16, after a demand by the accused. This was again extended to January 27. As of now, only 23 have given a reply to the notices and most of whom have denied their involvement.

According to officials, thousands of people staged protests against the CAA on December 20. Protests in eight towns, including Bijnor , Nehtaur, Nagina, Najbabad, Sherkot, Jalalabad and , Chandpur, turned violent. Protesters allegedly hurled stones at policemen and burnt vehicles. They also caused damage to public and private properties. Now, the administration has estimated the total loss at Rs 21.90 lakh.

Administration had served show-cause notices to 52 “troublemakers”, including nine in Bijnor city, 39 in Nehtaur and four in Nagina. An explanation has been sought from them over damage to public properties.

Additional district magistrate Avdhesh Kumar Mishra initially set the deadline as January 10 for the submission of their reply to the administration. Later, on the pleas by accused, the administration extended the deadline to January 16. But so far only 23 accused have replied to the notices. According to sources, they have claimed that they are innocent.

The rest of the “troublemakers” have sought time from the administration to submit their replies over properties damaged by protesters. Showing magnanimity, the administration has again extended the deadline to January 27.

On being asked about the matter, ADM Mishra, said, “We are providing appropriate opportunity to the accused to explain their side. All the claims will be resolved properly. We are waiting for their explanation. After completion of hearing in this connection, further action will be taken.”

PATNA: Super 30 founder Anand Kumar exhorted the non-resident Indians from Bihar residing in Kuwait to contribute to the progress of Bihar and Jharkhand . He was speaking as the chief guest at a function in Kuwait to mark 25 years of Bihar-Jharkhand Association – ‘ Maurya Kala Parishad ’ – on Friday.

He said Bihar, once considered a laggard state, and Jharkhand have made rapid strides in the last decade and this needed to continue in the decades to come to catch up with other developed states.

“Education is the most powerful medium to bring about turnaround in society. But apart from education, the NRIs can also contribute by getting involved with income and employment generating activities in the state,” he said.

He added that with strong and successful community from the two states, there is no reason why the two states cannot be at the top of ladder on all parameters of human index.

“Bihar has a huge population of youth. There is a progressive government. The climate is good. There is no problem in electricity supply. All these factors make it a favourite destination for businessmen and industrialists,” Anand said.

He added that strong Bihar and Jharkhand community, which have made a mark for themselves by doing hard work far away in Kuwait and yet kept their roots and values alive, must think of giving back to the society.

“It is not just money that matters. Your involvement and concern could lead to small innovations to change the lives of thousands of needy. Bihar today makes good business sense due to a number of positives. I urge you all to contribute your mite in that direction,” he added.

BHAGALPUR: Realizing the shortage of gynaecologists at primary health centres (PHCs), referral hospitals and other government hospitals, the state health department has decided to give choice posting to women doctors near their respective dwelling places.

Of late, women doctors either remain absent from duty or do not give proper time citing that they have been posted at far-off places from their homes or their professional commitments at private clinics.

Sources said major health schemes for women, including maternity schemes, have taken a backseat in view of shortage of gynaecologists at the hospitals.

In Bhagalpur district, there are only 16 gynaecologists against the requirement of 28 in 17 PHCs, sub-divisional health centres, referral hospitals and district hospital, sources said, adding the state health department has been informed about the shortage of gynaecologists and the problems the district has been facing in providing medicare to women patients.

Bhagalpur civil surgeon Dr Vijay Kumar Singh said the matter has been brought to the notice of the state health department. “We are hopeful that the government will take steps to address the issue in the interest of women patients visiting different government hospitals from and sub-urban areas.

67,['19/01/2020'],"Four RJD legislators praise Nitish’s work, create flutters","This story is from January 19, 2020

PATNA: As political parties in state are girding up loins to fight the assembly elections due in October-November this year, some RJD legislators have started heaping praises on CM Nitish Kumar , sending the rumour mill into overdrive in political circles. In recent months, at least four RJD legislators openly defied the party’s line and praised Nitish, who is also the JD(U) chief.

While RJD’s Gaighat MLA Maheshawar Prasad Yadav had been singing paeans to the CM for more than three years by describing him as ‘vikas purush’, the latest to join the list is Keoti MLA Faraz Fatmi.

Faraz, son of former Union minister MAA Fatmi, on Wednesday joined a ‘dahi-chura’ feast organised by JD(U)’s state president Bashishtha Narain Singh at his residence and declared that “there is no bigger face than Nitish in political arena of Bihar and only he will form government in the state after 2020 assembly polls”.

A few months ago, RJD MLC Sanjay Prasad had attended a JD(U) pragramme in Munger division and praised the development works undertaken by the CM.

While talking to TOI on Saturday, Sanjay Prasad said, “Nitish is a visionary leader. He is thinking about the welfare of 12 crore people of Bihar by launching a revolutionary campaign like Jal Jivan Hariyali. Some schemes initiated by him were adopted by the Centre. The RJD netas should thank the CM for his good works instead of criticizing him.”

Prasad, who was elected to the legislative council from Munger local body seat, even dared the RJD leadership to take disciplinary action against him. “What type of action they will take? I have not even renewed the membership of RJD,” he said

Insiders in RJD said Prasad was looking for an alibi to say good bye to the party. “He is planning to switch to the ruling JD(U) with the help an influential neta of Munger division,” an RJD source said.

Another RJD legislator who recently created flutters in state’s political circles by praising the CM is Suryagarha MLA Prahlad Yadav. Considered a loyalist of RJD boss Lalu Prasad, Prahlad not only shared dais with Nitish when the CM reached Suryagarha block on December 26 as part of his Jal Jivan Hariyali Yatra, but also praised him for “development works” and total prohibition.

Prahlad told TOI on Friday that had the RJD forbidden him from attending the CM’s meet in advance, he would not have shared dais with Nitish. “There was no such instruction. I went to the CM’s programme to raise certain genuine issues of my constituency,” he said.

RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said the party’s three legislators – Maheshawar Yadav, Sanjay Prasad and Faraz Fatmi – didn’t renew their membership of the party. “The trio neither renewed their membership nor made any new member during the party’s membership drive last year. Hence, they are not primary members of the party, but still the legislators of RJD,” Gagan said.

He added that the RJD leadership was watching the activities of these legislators. Gangan, however, said the party would not take any step to expel the three legislators from the organization. “Prahlad went to attend the CM’s programme due to a communication gap,” he said.

Education department additional chief secretary R K Mahajan talks to TOI’s Sheezan Nezami about the programme and how awareness was created among people for it. Excerpts.

Are you all fully prepared for the event?

Yes, all preparations have been made for the final show. There is a lot of excitement among people for this event and they are eager to create a history.

How did you create awareness regarding this human chain, especially among the people residing in rural areas?

Awareness programme had started at least a month back and 124 ‘kala jattha’ members were went to each and every corner of the state to promote the initiative. They informed people about the importance of environment through songs and nukkad natak. Apart from cultural programmes by ‘kala jattha’ members, various competitions were also organised in schools for children.

How many people do you think will take part in the human chain this time?

We expect four crore people to join it. The number might also increase. At least one crore Jeevika didis will participate in the human chain. Even members of nine lakh self-help groups will take part apart from common people, businessmen and government staff. Everyone is excited to be part of the event. This time, one human chain will also be formed from the main secretariat till Bailey Road, where secretariat staff will stand.

Will the basic facilities be available for the participants?

The participants will be provided with all the basic facilities like drinking water and toilets. In fact, health camps will also be set up and there will be one ambulance at a distance of 10km to meet any eventuality.

What about documentation of this mega event?

We are using 11 helicopters and three planes for recording the entire event. At least two drones will be used in each district for photography. The number of drones will be higher in Patna and some other districts.

How will you ensure safety of participants, especially schoolchildren?

Safety is our prime concern and traffic will be regulated for certain time period on the road where people will be standing in human chain. Only essential services like ambulance and fire tenders will be allowed. Police personnel will also be deployed.

What is the need to form a human chain to promote Jal Jivan Hariyali or any other social issue?

Any social issue can be addressed in a proper way only when people connect it. It is important to get people involved in such event because so that they can realize the importance of the issue. The idea behind this human chain is to take the message to the panchayat and ward level.

69,['19/01/2020'],Politics is being played over human chain: Congress,"This story is from January 19, 2020

PATNA: Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader in the state assembly, Sadanand Singh, said on Saturday that he would not participate in the much-hyped human chain proposed by chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Sunday. He alleged that “certain kind of politics is being played” in the name of the awareness drive on environment and climate change.

“It is true that I had extended my support to the state government’s Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Abhiyan because it is meant for the welfare of all living creatures. I will, however, not join the human chain because certain kind of politics is being played over it now,” Singh told TOI on Saturday and rejected reports suggesting that he would participate in the human chain.

State Congress chief Madan Mohan Jha had earlier opposed the human chain and alleged that the government funds were being misused.

“A meeting on the bad impact of climate change was convened in the central hall of the assembly, in which members of all political parties had participated few months ago. Moreover, the CM had visited all the districts as part of his Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Yatra recently and held meetings and rallies. All that was enough to create awareness about the campaign,” Singh said.

He added, “Instead of spending money on the human chain, the government should have focused on planting more saplings and protecting them. Are even 10% of the saplings, which were planted before, alive?”

Meanwhile, three RJD legislators — Gaighat MLA Maheshwar Prasad Yadav, Keoti MLA Faraz Fatmi and MLC Sanjay Prasad — will join the human chain on Sunday. They have also urged their followers to come forward to support the government’s initiative to protect the environment.

“I have openly declared that I will join the human chain at Chakai in Jamui district,” MLC Prasad told TOI.

Faraz said, “The human chain will be formed to create awareness and protect the environment. It, therefore, has my full support. I even went to Keoti with the district magistrate of Darbhanga to appeal to people to join the human chain.”

The RJD’s top leadership, including its president Lalu Prasad and leader of opposition, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, have opposed the human chain and asked their supporters not to join it. Tejashwi, in a tweet, attacked the CM for hiring 15 helicopters and spending crores only to take photographs of the event.

72,['19/01/2020'],Ichhapore SNZ declared customs area for rough diamond trading,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Surat: Leading diamond mining companies from around the world will descend in Surat by the end of February to sell their rough diamonds directly to city’s diamantaires.

The Surat International Diatrade Centre’s (SIDC) Special Notified Zone (SNZ) located at Gujarat Hira Bourse (GHB) in Ichhapore has been declared customs area for carrying out import, trading and re-export of rough diamonds.

The annual import of rough diamonds in India is pegged at $18 billion. About 70% of the rough diamonds are procured from the big diamond mining companies including De Beers, Alrosa, Rio Tinto, Dominion etc., while the rest comes into the country from the secondary markets in Antwerp and Dubai.

After the Bharat Diamond Bourse (BDB) operated SNZ in Mumbai, this will be the second SNZ in the country for rough diamond trading. The diamantaires will be able to participate in viewing and auction of the goods at the SNZ by the diamond mining companies and also close deals.

Talking to TOI, chairman of SIDC, Dinesh Navadiya said, “We are in the process of getting the clearance of customs custodian at the SNZ for carrying out trading and auction, which we are expecting to happen soon. We will start the SNZ after the permission.”

Navadiya added that they have already intimated to the diamond mining companies about the SNZ in Surat and they have expressed their willingness to come down to Surat for direct trade in rough diamonds.”

The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) has partnered with GHB for setting up of the special purpose vehicle (SPV) in order to facilitate the trading, import and re-export of rough diamonds from SNZ.

73,['19/01/2020'],‘Giving 5G trial to Huawei a major setback for sector’,"Gandhinagar: Dr V K Saraswat, a member of Niti Aayog — the policy thinktank of the Government of India — on Saturday said that the country should focus on developing capacity in 5G technology. He expressed his apprehension about awarding the trial of 5G technology to a Chinese major. The move by top officials had sparked a debate in 2019 over security concerns. Dr Saraswat was the chief guest at the 16th convocation of DAIICT in Gandhinagar.“Developing indigenous electronics components should be our main focus. Many Indian companies perform ‘screwdriver assembly’ to maintain competitive costs,” Dr Saraswat said. “Hardware is becoming a major threat to cyber security. We don’t know what malware is embedded. I believe the permission granted to the Chinese company Huawei for the 5G trial is a major setback.” He went on to say: “The trials will score over the indigenous sector. We should ensure that more companies and educational institutes quickly start 5G development.”Dr Saraswat, who is also the chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), termed the university a ‘battleground for political parties’. But he said that he is never in favour of closing it down. “It’s not the answer. But we are drawing a tough line,” he said. “Their (students’) demands are not logical. Is Rs 10 rent for a hostel room logical? Even Delhi University charges Rs 1,800. Some professors today at the university had paid Rs 10 when they were students.” The former DRDO chairman defended the government on its economic policies and said that Niti Ayog is working on both demand and supply side of the economy for its revival. He said that the economic slump is a global phenomenon and India is doing the best it can.He said that India today needs to find a balance between scientific solutions for societal needs and big projects for advancement of sciences. When asked what stops the government from spending on research and development, Dr Saraswat said that the government doesn’t have resources today as the budget was slashed for all departments in December. He said that the ‘freebies’ offered by the state and central governments are eating into major government revenues.‘Net shutdown had no impact on Kashmir economy’In an answer to a question on the prolonged internet shutdown in Kashmir, Dr Saraswat said that the reason for the shutdown was to maintain peace. “Otherwise what’s happening on Delhi’s streets would happen in Kashmir. Net shutdown doesn’t have a bearing on Kashmir’s economy,” he said. “Do you think it’s used for e-tailing? No, it’s used for watching dirty films.”475 get degrees at DAIICTIn all, 475 students, including eight PhD candidates, were conferred degrees at the 16th convocation of DAIICT in Gandhinagar on Saturday. During the event, four students received the president’s gold medals for academic excellence. The officials announced two new courses — BTech in mathematics & computing and MSc in data science — from the next academic year.

Surat: Various teams of the city police have left from the city to various destinations in north India in search of the two employees of the diamond firm who escaped with 1296.38 carat polished diamonds worth Rs 3.51 crore on Thursday evening.

The accused are suspected to have fled towards New Delhi and from there they might escape to Nepal, believe the police.

The police got a specific information that the accused — Raju Luhar, a resident of Lal Darwaja, and Prakash Kunwar of Mahidharpura — boarded a train on early Friday morning. Police investigation revealed that they boarded Golden Temple Mail during early hours on Friday and reached Delhi. They left the unit H Vinod Kumar (HVK) at around 7.30 pm on Thursday.

Luhar had kept the diamonds in his tiffin box to avoid getting caught in security check. The complaint was lodged with Katargam police station by Hitesh Vaghasiya, an official of the unit.

“Police teams have left the city in search of the accused. Police are hunting for them in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh from where they may escape to Nepal,” said an official from Katargam police station.

Along with the teams of Katargam police station, teams of the crime branch have also joined the search of the accused. The cops are trying to ensure that the accused must not sell the stolen diamonds or cross the border.

The police investigation revealed that the accused had planned the theft well in advance. “They had booked their train tickets in advance. Luhar had already sent his wife and daughter to Nepal,” said the official.

Kunwar was unmarried and lived in a rented accommodation. Luhar had been employed for the past 15 years and was a trusted employee. He had recently brought Kunwar for work. The employer informed police that Luhar worked on diamond worth over Rs 8 crore in the past but there was no complaint against him. The employers are also surprised that why did the accused resort to stealing.

AGRA: National Human Right Commission (NHRC) team, which is probing the alleged police aggression on AMU campus on December 15, will revisit the university after it starts functioning fully as many students who were injured or detained by police are yet to record their statements.

Talking with TOI, SSP Manzil Saini, who heads the team, said almost 80% of work has been completed but many students injured during the violence were not available for recording their statements as the university is opening in phases. She said a few reports, including forensic analysis of Morrison court hostel where a room allegedly caught fire, is also awaited.

Till now, 48 students, including the petitioner, have recorded their statements. Besides, 38 university employees, including guards, gate keepers and proctorial team members, 52 police personnel along with RAF and district administration officials have also given their statements to the team.

The SSP told TOI that three-four-hour CCTV footage of the ill-fated day is also being analyzed. There were lot of instructions issued by AMU authorities and district administration on the intervening night of December 15 and 16 and a few days before the violence took place. All documents that have been provided to the team will also be considered while preparing the report.

The tanker sourced water from a pit near Thiruvallam and supplied it to hotels and hospitals in the city

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The corporation’s health squad seized a tanker lorry which was found collecting water from a contaminated source to supply hotels and hospitals in the city. The squad seized the tanker when the water collected from a pit near Thiruvallam was being pumped into the tank of a hotel in the city.

The hotel was ordered to close down for the day as the water was labelled ‘for drinking purpose’. The city corporation has mandated that only tankers registered with it shall be authorised to distribute water from February 1. Mayor K Sreekumar said tankers found to be distributing water collected from unhygienic sources and charging exorbitant rates would be penalised.

The registration of private water tankers had begun on Tuesday. The initiative is being jointly implemented by the corporation and Kerala Water Authority. All private tankers distributing drinking water and water for commercial purposes have been directed to register with the corporation by January 22. All tankers failing to register will be considered unauthorised and be levied a fine of Rs 25,000-50,000.

The corporation had recently passed a bylaw to monitor the functioning of private tankers in the city. The water being collected from filling stations will be monitored daily and water samples from tankers will be tested every three months.

Tankers can be registered via the Smart Trivandrum mobile app. The facility can be availed at health circle offices, Akshaya centres, and the call centre at the corporation’s main office.

The water required for agriculture and industrial purpose can be collected from Muttathara sewage treatment plant and septage treatment plants in flats and industrial institutions.

VARANASI: The Kotwali police of Azamgarh on Friday filed an FIR against jailed criminal Akhand Pratap Singh and an unidentified person on the complaint of additional district judge (ADJ) Lalta Prasad. The judge has alleged in his complaint that a youth had unauthorisedly entered his government accommodation after dodging the security personnel.

In his complaint, the ADJ said that following surrender of Akhand Pratap in December, a threat letter was thrown in his court asking him not show hurry in his case. Later, on January 12, a youth entered his government quarters after dodging the security personnel, he mentioned adding, he could not see the youth as he was in the washroom. Before he could come out of washroom, the youth left his quarters, the ADJ said and added that he knew about the youth from the security personnel.

Ahmedabad: Chandan Vidi, 67, a resident of Teen Murti Bungalow at Surdhara Circle, lodged a complaint at Vastrapur police station on Friday stating that cyber criminals siphoned off Rs 94,677 from his credit card, after extracting information from him by pretending to be updating his “Know Your Customer” (KYC) details for his e-wallet.

Vidi is a trustee of Asia School and College, located on Drive-In Road.

According to the complaint, at about 2.30pm on January 1, 2020, Vidi got a call from a man who identified himself Kumar and said he was calling on behalf of an e-wallet company.

The man told him to update his KYC details, or his e-wallet would be deactivated. He told Vidi that depositing a nominal amount in his e-wallet would do the trick. Vidi proceeded to deposit Rs 101 from his credit card to his e-wallet.

‘Kumar’ then told him to download an Android application called ‘Viewer’ and click yes to a certain prompt. In no time, Rs 40,800 and Rs 48,960 was automatically deposited from his credit card to his e-wallet.

Vidi was shocked and immediately called his bank to block his credit card, but by the time he did so, Rs 94,677 had been transferred from his e-wallet to three other e-wallet accounts in 17 different transactions.

86,['19/01/2020'],Resettled families got only one of 12 aid installments: Study,"This story is from January 19, 2020

CHENNAI: A study conducted by researchers working with families displaced from informal settlements in the city to the outskirts found that a majority of the beneficiaries received only one of 12 instalments of Rs 2,500 monthly subsistence the government is mandated to give under law.

The study was conducted by researchers from Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities (IRCDUC) and Housing and Land Rights Network (HLRN), who work with the families and the government. Since November 2016, the state government has resettled more than 10,373 families (41,500 people) from 40 informal settlements on banks of rivers and canals in the city to tenements of Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) at Perumbakkam and Navalur on the southern outskirts and Gudapakkam in the north.

The families were evicted under the Integrated Cooum River Eco-Restoration Plan implemented by the Greater Chennai Corporation , public works department and TNSCB.

The study was conducted after complaints by residents during meetings with the researchers. A questionnaire covering the rehabilitation and resettlement package was given to the families. The data was collected in December last and in early January. The study was conducted for families evicted from Navalar Nedunchezhiyan Nagar and Pallavan Nagar — the largest settlements comprising 150 families each. A sample size of 8% was used.

The survey found that most families received only one instalment of the monthly amount of Rs 2,500. None had received all instalments, it said. “This has increased the vulnerability of the communities which are already displaced from their place of livelihood and lost a family income,” the study said. It also found that 96% of the families received irregular payments, while only 4% said they received it once in three months. “As the families didn’t know when the payment would be made to their accounts, they were forced to take loans at high rates in anticipation of money from the government. This has put them into heavy debt,” the study said.

Among other issues raised by the residents were high electricity bills, poor construction quality of the buildings, lack of elevators and dark roads which are havens for drugs and alcohol. The residents echoed a demand for bus stands in both the front and rear of the new phase in Perumbakkam for quicker access. The researchers also quoted residents complaining about lack of a proper grievance redressal mechanism.

Responding to the study, a senior TNSCB official said he hasn’t received any complaint on monthly subsistence. “It is credited directly into the bank account every month. I shall look into it,” he said. On construction and safety, he said the buildings were designed by the best architects and they would not have any dark spaces.

Sanjay Raut (left) at an award function in Belagavi on Saturday

BELAGAVI/PUNE: Shiv Sena’s Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut on Saturday sought to pacify the border dispute between the Maharashtra and Karnataka after he snubbed the neighbouring state on micro-blogging site Twitter.

Raut said the Maharashtra government was committed to obey the Supreme Court’s order on the dispute but to protect the interest of language, culture and identity and maintain harmony, he would mediate between Karnataka and Maharashtra chief ministers to bring them on one table.

“I shall mediate a talk between Uddhav Thackrey and B S Yediyurappa to come on one table and work on harmony on these issues.”

Earlier in the day, he slammed Karnataka on Twitter saying “Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Rohingyas can easily enter India, but it is becoming difficult for people of Maharashtra to enter Belagavi.”

The borders on both sides remained a little tensed since Friday afternoon when Maharashtra’s minister of state for health Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar was detained and sent back for entering Belagavi allegedly without any information. Raut had slammed the Karnataka government for this move. Besides, Kolhapur saw sporadic protests by Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti and Shiva Sena cadre.

At an award ceremony function held at Belagavi, Raut altered the tone over the prevailing border issue. He was escorted by the Belagavi city police from Sambra airport to the main event as a measure of precaution.

At the award ceremony organised by Marathi public library in the city, he attended the interaction session with two senior Marathi journalists Narendra Kotekar and Anand Mense. Responding to the question of the scribes on the border issue, he said, “The matter is sub-judice. Raking up the issue again and again is not good. The Maharashtra government has employed one of the best advocates of the country, Harish Salve, to fight the legal battle and it will go on.”

The dispute over 865 villages in the border area and Belagavi city has been simmering for over six decades between Maharashtra and Karnataka.

Raut’s statements to play down the row assumes significance considering that soon after taking charge as the chief minister, Uddhav Thackeray had termed Belagavi as “Karnataka-occupied”. He also appointed ministers Chhagan Bhujbal and Eknath Shinde as coordinators to oversee his government’s efforts to expedite the petition related to the border dispute in Supreme Court.

Karnataka chief minister Yediyurappa immediately declared that not even an inch of the state’s land would be given away. Bus service from Karnataka to Maharashtra was suspended owing to tension in the border area.

On Friday, Patil-Yadravkar was stopped from reaching Belagavi to participate in the “Martyrs’ Day” event organized every year in remembrance of those who died in a firing on January 17, 1956, following massive violence over the border dispute. The Karnataka police took Patil-Yadravkar back to Kognoli check post on Maharashtra-Karnataka border on the NH4.

Patil-Yadravkar told TOI that he had been going to Belagavi every year to attend the event and had intimated the police there about his arrival this time too.

“I had gone as a minister and representative of people of Maharashtra, but the Karnataka police detained me and dropped me at border area. It indicates that the Karnataka government is ill-treating Marathi-speaking people residing in the border area of Karnataka,” he said after reaching Kolhapur.

Terming the incident of minister’ detention as unfortunate, Raut said, “if anything happens to Kannadigas in Maharashtra and ministers from the neighbouring state want to visit the state, we shall welcome them. This culture should be reciprocated by the Karnataka authorities too.”

Belagavi SP Laxman Nimbargi clarified, “He (Yadravkar) was not technically detained. But the city police asked him to go back to his state as the situation in Belagavi was a little tense. He was escorted by the district police till the Maharashtra border, from where he went in his own vehicle.”

91,['19/01/2020'],Corp withholds occupancy certificate for building,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The state government has been caught between legality and its mission to promote business while dealing with an application for occupancy certificate for a high-rise construction at Thampanoor.

The file had come up in an adalat convened by LSG minister A C Moideen to clear pending applications a few months ago and the corporation was directed to process the application, subject to norms. However, authorities are in a stalemate over a decision to be taken in the wake of pending case pertaining to alleged encroachment of puramboku land and illegal access to the property.

The building owner’s demand for issuing occupancy certificate is backed by a decision of former minister P J Joseph who had issued a special order allowing construction of a path over Amayizhanjan canal to provide access to the property. But, the corporation is yet to issue occupancy to the building – the construction of which is almost complete – as there is a pending case in the high court demanding quashing of the government order. A legal opinion received by the corporation recently has advised against issuing occupancy to the construction until the case at the high court is settled.

The issue dates to 2009 when the department of minor irrigation entered into an agreement with a private party to construct a slab over the Amayizhanjan Canal to gain access to the proposed building in Thiruvananthapuram. The agreement was signed incorporating 14 conditions. Later, the irrigation department in a series of communications reported that the proposed construction was done without complying with the major conditions in the agreement and that demarcation of puramboku land was not done. The irrigation department forwarded the communication to then district collector pointing out violations and requesting steps to assess the puramboku land and to demolish the construction. With the irrigation department raising objections to illegal construction of access, the corporation had cancelled the permit which was later reinstated following a high court order.

Irrigation department had issued an order allowing retention of slab and citing that permission of the construction of slabs with structural stability over drains to interconnect properties without causing obstructions to the flow of water and on conditions to dismantle it at one’s own risk and cost is an infrastructural necessity to provide access for developmental activities. “This is highly essential in making Kerala a global business hub. If at all any thodu or puramboku is involved for the purpose, it will be of minimal extent,” the order issued during the rule of previous LDF government led by V S Achuthanandan said.

93,['19/01/2020'],Handling of plastic waste must be shared responsibility: Corp,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Branded packaged items will be brought under the extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) plan from February. The city corporation has initiated steps to make suppliers of branded items being sold in supermarkets, shops and retail chains register with the civic body. According to officials, with the plastic ban exempting branded items, the task of having to recycle packaging waste from various shops is enormous and the corporation is riding on the plastic waste management rules 2016 to introduce registration of branded items.

The government order banning single-use plastic has excluded branded items/products. It was directed that manufacturers/producers of these products are bound to comply with the EPR plan submitted to the Kerala state pollution control board . All the producers/retailers/importers are mandated to comply with EPR guidelines, the order said.

It directed that the waste generated from plastic packaging of branded items and public sector undertakings be dealt as per the EPR plan and that they be channelized through existing waste collection facilities set up by local bodies.

When the Union government issued plastic waste management rules in 2016, producers and brand owners were directed to work out modalities within a period of six months from the notification of rules. They clearly state that the main responsibility for collection of used multi-layered plastic sheets or pouches or packaging rests with producers, importers and brand owners who introduce the products in the market. However, a concrete EPR plan is yet to be submitted by brand owners. PCB has been striving to get it done with regard to electronic goods producers.

The corporation runs 53 centres and spends nearly Rs 4 crore annually on manpower, transport, maintenance for periodic collection and disposal of dry waste, mainly plastic. “Registration will be done to assess the quantity of branded plastic items in shops every month. The responsibility will have to be shared equally. Even the retail chains which sell provisions in their labelled covers will also be brought under EPR,” a corporation official said.

The corporation officials said that it is highly imperative for suppliers and producers of branded items to share the responsibility of handling the waste. In 2018, the first-ever brand audit for plastic waste conducted by the Green Army as part of the national level audit launched by Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA) in the city showed that large-scale milk manufacturers and producers of kitchen provisions account for the lion’s share of plastic waste being dumped by households.

The brand audit which was conducted in 134 households covering 100 wards in the city revealed that plastic products with maximum recycle value are less used in the city while items like Tetra Paks, which are multi-layered products, are hugely dumped out of households and these have little or no recycle value.

The audit mainly featured plastic bags, composite/multi-layered packaging, single layer plastics, polystyrene, hard plastics (HDPE/LDPE/PP) like shampoo bottles, lotion bottles, bottle caps, PET plastics like soda bottles, water bottles and juice bottles.

Police sources said that on Friday, the girl lodged a complaint that Chaudhary, after coming out on bail, is still harassing and threatening her.

In a separate case filed at Sola police station, a 16-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a youth. The youth had threatened the girl to keep her mouth shut or he would kill her family.

PUNE: Prakash Ambedkar-led Vachit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) has called for a state-wide bandh on January 24 to oppose the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens.

Ambedkar on Saturday said the bandh call has received support from 35 organizations. “All these organizations will participate in the bandh against the Union government, which was attempting to terrorize citizens and was acting against constitutional rights,” he said.

Ambedkar said the protest was also against BJP’s failure to tackle prevailing severe economic crisis in the country. “We want to make citizens aware about the social and economic challenges that the country is going to face because of the BJP’s undemocratic style of functioning. The bandh will be held in a peaceful manner,” he said. Asked if the NCP and Congress would join the bandh, Ambedkar said he wanted everyone to rise against the government’s stand. “The government cannot take decisions in an abrupt manner. The issue is not only confined to Muslims, but also a large Hindu population who will be affected because of NRC and CAA,” he said.

He said the government should explain if it had adequate money to run the system. The recent reports on financial status have pointed out that the government was facing a deficit of Rs 3 lakh crore and there was little scope of revival before the forthcoming annual budget.

CM Yogi Adityanath

GORAKHPUR: Work on Bundelkhand expressway will begin next month and the Expressway will be open for public by the end of 2020. This was informed by chief minister Yogi Adityanath during Kisan Samman Samaroh in Gorakhpur on Saturday.

CM Yogi also honoured first 40 farmers who registered their land for the construction of Gorakhpur-link Expressway. “Farmers who gave their land for Gorakhpur-link expressway have been good compensation and the money has been transferred directly in their accounts, said the CM.

CM Yogi thanked farmers for their cooperation and explained that without development migration can’t be stopped. “Every one’s support and cooperation with the government is needed for development and Gorakhpur is an example as government could propose Bundelkhand Expressway and Gorakhpur link expressway with people’s support,” added Yogi.

Over 500 farmers attended the programme.

The CM advised to start skill development classes at Gorakhpur Industrial development area (GIDA) to check migration of youth.

“Gorakhpur was out of the reach of expressway but now work on Gorakhpur link expressway and industrial passage has been initiated. Without land, industry couldn’t be set up and without industry and development, migration can’t be stopped,” the CM added.

While enumerating the state government’s achievements, he said: “For two years, there was no air connectivity in Gorakhpur but now eight flights are running from Gorakhpur. This is the same city, where 10 years before, Air India officials used to complain of few passengers, but now they feel the need of more flights. The industrial corridor will be developed. Already the construction of bio-fuel plant at Dhuriapar has started and 15 lakh ton sugarcane pressed at Pipraich sugar mill so far. With AIIMS people will get better medical treatment here. Zoo is being developed in Gorakhpur and we are getting positive support for development and we’ll move forward in this direction.”

Visitors at a stall at YMCA Grounds, Nandanam on Saturday

CHENNAI: Non-fictions, current affairs, children’s books, environment and ecology are some of the titles seeing a lot of demand at the 43rd Chennai Book Fair . As the fair entered the 10th day on Saturday, many publishers and book sellers said sales have exceeded compared to last year.

The Booksellers and Publishers’ Association of South India (BAPASI) said 9lakh to 10lakh people have visited the fair so far.

Sahitya Akademi winning novel “Sool” by Cho Dharman is one of the favourites. “So far, we have sold more than 6,000 copies. We expect the number to cross 10,000 before the end of the fair,” said Sadhiq, a publisher of the book. He said the sale of books at his stall almost doubled compared to the previous year.

“Non-fiction books including history, social issues, and current affairs are moving out fast,” said writer and publisher S Ramakrishnan. He said lack of marketing and space for selling books are a major concern for the publishers. “Top institutions Anna University and IIT Madras do not have a separate book store for students who want to study beyond textbooks. The government should consider opening book shops in all districts on the line of Amma canteens and sell books at subsidized rates,” he suggested.

BAPASI president R S Shanmugam said so far, footfalls at the fair has seen an increase of 30% compared to last year and people’s interest in books has increased in the last few years.

However, Parthi Balu of Vasaka Saalai publishing house said greater footfalls may not translate into sale of books.

Manikandan, one of the publishers of children books, said the sale of children’s literature is brisk.

AKBARPUR (KANPUR DEHAT): The original case diary of Behmai massacre , in which 20 people were allegedly shot dead by ‘ Bandit Queen ’ Phoolan Devi ’s gang nearly four decades ago, was found to be missing on Saturday when a special court was about to pronounce its verdict. This prompted the judge to defer the matter to January 24.

Special judge, Dacoit Affected Area Court of Kanpur Dehat, Sudhir Kumar hauled up the sessions clerk for the absence of the case diary and asked him to place it before the court on January 24. District government counsel (criminal) Rajeev Porwal said no judge could pronounce a verdict in the absence of an original case diary.

The court is likely to give its verdict on the role of four of the 35 accused — Posha, Bhikha, Vishwanath and Shyambabu. While Posha is in jail, the other three are out on bail. Three others, including Man Singh, are on the run.

Many of the rest, including Phoolan Devi, are dead.

KOCHI: The state-level monitoring committee (SLMC) on environment appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has expressed its dissatisfaction with the situation at the demolition sites in Maradu . Members of the panel interacted with contractors and found that most of the instructions regarding management of debris were not being complied with.The team headed by chairman Justice (retd) AV Ramakrishna Pillai visited all the four demolition sites on Saturday. The members also inspected the backwaters on a boat.“I am not at all satisfied with the debris management at Alfa Serene about which nearby residents have also been complaining. Dust is still hanging over these areas. We had interactions with contractors as well. The situations looks a little better at Holy Faith as the contractors said that they will be able to immediately make use of the debris to make hollow bricks and pavement tiles. It appears that they have already identified potential buyers to transfer the material,” Justice Pillai said.He said that as of now, water is being sprinkled only in places where the debris is being broken down. “But from the rest of the area, dust is still moving around. They have to put in the sprinkler just like it would be during a rainfall so that the entire dust in the entire area would get settled. Also, specific instructions were given asking that 30ft barricades be put up around the debris spot. That has also not been done. People are very uncomfortable around Alfa Serene. Nearby houses trees are also completed covered with dust,” he said.SLMC has sought a technical report from the contractors. “We have asked them to be present at the meeting likely to be held on January 24 in Thiruvananthapuram. We will issue further directives after seeing their action-taken report,” the chairman said. The RDO, Fort Kochi who now has additional charge as secretary, Maradu municipality will also have to attend the meeting, according to the SLMC chairman’s directives.Earlier, he specifically instructed the pollution control board to follow up on the directions already given to the local body. PCB chief engineer MA Baiju informed the SLMC that the contractors who are engaged in removing the debris have submitted applications seeking authorization for storage and processing of debris into useful products like sand etc. The PCB is likely to conduct a session to hear the contractors on how they plan the safe removal of debris.However, officials have expressed apprehension as to whether the clearing operations could be completed within the time frame.PCB officials said that the local authority is responsible for satisfactorily completing debris removal, as per the directions of the Supreme Court. They were instructed to report the plans proposed, including to where this debris is being transferred and which units are engaged for reprocessing of debris etc, by the local body.Chief engineer MA Baiju, Mini Mary Sam, environmental engineer, assistant engineers of PCB and Maradu municipality were also part of the inspection team.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73367485,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-896317,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/questions-over-debris-management-at-maradu/articleshow/73363656.cms

File photo of Kannan Gopinathan

ALLAHABAD: Former IAS officer from Kerala, Kannan Gopinathan , was on Saturday detained soon after he touched down at Allahabad airport to participate in an event on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Gopinathan, who was detained 2 hours at the airport, tweeted he would soon return to UP after he was forced him to board a return flight to Delhi.

“Not allowed to get out of Allahabad airport and put on a flight to Delhi. Independent Banana Republic of Uttar Pradesh offers free Delhi travel every time. @myogiadityanath is so afraid of free speech. Will be coming again. Make your bookings in advance this time @Uppolice,” he tweeted. This was the second time he was detained by UP Police. Earlier, he was stopped from attending an event on citizenship law in Aligarh.

Gopinathan was scheduled to address a symposium organised by All-India People’s Forum on ‘Nagrikta Bachao, Samvidhan Bachao, Loktantra Bachao’ (Save Citizenship, Save Constitution, Save Democracy)’.

Talking to TOI after landing at Delhi airport on Saturday, Gopinanathan said: “As soon as I came out of the plane, 10 policemen approached me and asked my identity. They swiftly escorted me to VIP lounge and then to a security room.”

“Police asked me about my schedule after leaving Allahabad. When I told them I have to catch a flight for Bokaro from Delhi, they sent me back to Delhi at 4pm,” he added. Gopinathan said he would visit Varanasi on January 20 to participate in an event titled ‘Young India Dialogue’.

The former IAS officer hogged the limelight after resigning from his post, claiming people of J&K were being denied their fundamental rights after revocation of Article 370.

Meanwhile, convener of the symposium Kamal Usri said: “Gopinathan called me before boarding the flight for Allahabad. We were waiting when we noticed his tweets. In one tweet he said ‘detained’ and in the other he wrote ‘at Allahabad airport’.”

He said the administration was informed about the event in advance. “We were not agitating on roads or causing disturbance. We were holding the programme inside a hall in Alopibagh area,” he said.

However, police claimed Gopinathan was not detained. “We did not detain the former IAS officer. We only told him that the situation in the city was not calm and his presence may lead to a law and order problem. After this, he went back on his own,” claimed Allahabad SSP Satyarth Aniruddh Pankaj. The SSP said, there were intelligence inputs that Gopinathan was also planning to visit Roshan Bagh, where women are staging protests against the citizenship law since a week.

PUNE: The cut-off percentile for general students to qualify for JEE Advanced was expected to remain similar to last year’s at 90, experts said.

The Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains results were declared on Friday night.

“This year, there was almost a 35-40 marks range in the test that corresponded to the same percentile point, which implied that the difficulty-level of the tests varied significantly across slots. Last year, the difficulty-level was more or less uniform. For example, a student with 166 marks scored 99.3 percentile and another student with 201 marks also scored 99.3 percentile,” Durgesh Mangeshkar, the founder-director of IITian’s Prashikshan Kendra, said.

He said the difference in difficulty-level did not challenge the existing process as the mathematical way in which percentile points were calculated for each slot was fair for all students.

As of now, the National Testing Agency has only given percentile scores. The final JEE Mains rank would be allotted after phase II of the JEE Mains exam in April.

“Assuming only a few new students will write the phase II of JEE Mains and there won’t be much change in the order of ranks, 99 percentile will correspond to 9,500 rank in the common merit list. The cut-off for the general category should be close to 88 percentile,” Vaibhav Bakliwal of Bakliwal Tutorials said.

Lalit Kumar from Prime Academy, Pune said there was not a single candidate with 100 percentile from the entire state this time around.

Yateesh, who is in his early 30s, was transferred to the school a year ago. Earlier, a few students had complained to other teachers about Yateesh passing lewd remarks. However, as school authorities failed to act on the complaints, students informed their parents about the matter.

On Friday afternoon, angry parents and local villagers gathered outside the school and demanded an explanation from Yateesh.

“Seeing the crowd, Kumar locked himself up in a classroom. Parents locked the door from outside and called us. We booked him under IPC Section-354 (outraging modesty of women),” said police. On Saturday, the education department suspended Yateesh.

A beautification drive is underway in Bhopal

BHOPAL: The Swachh survey 2020 got underway in the state capital on Saturday. A team appointed by the Union ministry of urban development is expected to inspect a minimum 5% of locations in all 85 wards under the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC). The civic body is aiming to improve its ranking, which slipped from second to 19th in the last survey.

BMC officials claimed they are not being intimated about the team movement.

The survey team will inspect around 60 locations across all BMC wards. It is expected to take four days. This is for the first time that the Swachh survey, being carried out in 4,370 cities in a period of 28 days, would be digital and paperless. On Saturday, a few wards were inspected by the team, including slum areas.

Direct observation carried the most points in the overall 6,000 score of the survey. It includes a check of nine indicators. Assessors do not interact with the civic body until cross-verification of audit, said a BMC official. It includes a check on cleanliness in residential and commercial areas. Physical verification of residential areas is picked from slum, Old city and unplanned areas.

The survey team also visited vegetable and fruit and fish markets. They checked for litter bins, which should be available at every 50 metres. Catchment areas of both railway stations, bus stations and ISBT, including transport hubs and airport would be checked in the next two days, said sources.

Measures undertaken to reduce the level of dust in the air would also be inspected. The Swachh survey mandates zero tolerance on encroachment around storm water drains and water bodies in the city.

Open dumpsites near the lakes is expected to be a challenge for the BMC. The civic wireless system was buzzing through the day with officials keeping a vigilant eye on sanitation works.

Madra high court

CHENNAI: The Madras high court has made it clear that the right to admit a nationalised bank employee as a member of a particular union vests with the union concerned and that the bank has no say over it.

Justice K Ravichandrabaabu made the observation while modifying a circular issued by the Union finance ministry directing all the nationalised banks to facilitate auto deduction of membership subscription of employees’ unions from the salary of their staff.

Disposing of the pleas moved by Canara Bank Employees Union and Canara Bank Officers Association, the court said such banks cannot auto debit such subscription fee without the concurrence of the union/association concerned.

The issue pertains to a circular issued by the finance ministry dated November 25, 2019 to all nationalised banks regarding online facility for recording/modifying employee mandate for deduction of association membership subscription from salary.

Claiming that the circular is against the basic tenets of trade union rights to admit the members and regulate the same, the associations has approached the court seeking to quash the circular.

“By enabling auto admission of members by accepting their subscription fee automatically from their salary, the union concerned is deprived of its right to accept or reject membership of an individual applicant on valid grounds,” the petitioners said.

Responding to the plea, the finance ministry submitted that the ultimate deduction from the salary of an employee towards subscription of union is only at his/her written request and not at the request of the union.

Such request for deduction of subscription from salary was hitherto submitted in physical format which is now digitalised, and the employees are advised to submit the same through their office application. The said guidelines are only to align with the advent of technology and seamless movement of such request and for immediate implementation of such request of deduction of subscription and therefore, there is no violation of any legal right of the petitioner, the ministry said.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The corporation council that met here on Saturday approved resuming daily collection of waste from households based on a monthly fee of Rs 800. The agenda by health committee cited that community facilities may be set up in coastal areas and backward housing colonies. Expression of interests will be invited from service providers willing to set up facilities for processing of waste collected on a daily basis from households. BJP councillor Girikumar raised apprehensions regarding collection of Rs 800 as user fee.

He said the corporation should write to the state government to relax the user fee or else people from humble background will not be able to avail the facility. The councillor also sought clarity on having a dual system — source-level waste management based on kitchen bins and door-to-door collection for centralised treatment. He asked the council which package should the public opt for.

Mayor K Sreekumar said the corporation has the obligation to provide door-to- door collection if anybody demands it as per the decision of state-level monitoring committee constituted in accordance with the NGT directive. Fifty households will be taken care of by one service provider under door-to-door waste collection .

The civic body plans to make use of 414 aerobic bins installed in 55 places in the city to process the waste being collected from households. The spill-over waste will be handed over to 19 authorised agencies who run pig farms and specialise in pit composting. The council meeting held in October had approved the list of bulk waste collectors at a rate of Rs 5/kg.

In 2017, the corporation had pitched slab-based user fee for waste management; however, it was forced to withdraw the decision to impose Rs 800 as collection and processing charges for waste management. The user fee which was fixed at Rs 250 per month for collection of recyclable waste and maintenance of kitchen bins had to be slashed to Rs 200.

Knapp, chairman and global create officer, Landor, and a global leader in brand consulting was one of the keynote speakers at Ahmedabad Design Week, organized by Karnavati University. According to Knapp, education and communication with the public is the key to improving sustainability in cities.

“People will not do what they don’t know. Local authorities need to show the benefit and understand what the motivation will be for the public. Not just creating a law, but show through some sense of invention, creativity, motivation what the benefit is,” Knapp told TOI.

“If you motivate them there is a very good reason to do it and there is a benefit from it, then the communication has more value; it touches people’s hearts,” he said.

Knapp emphasised on the education of children on sustainability. “Educating children with a sense of responsibility means getting to the root of the problem. They then become the advocates of tomorrow. If the young population can understand the importance of their future, then that is a very meaningful place to start,” he said.

AHMEDABAD: Most kids who have hearing impairment since birth tend to face major trouble with speech too. But the journey of Vidisha Baliyan , who was the Miss World Deaf for the year 2019, was different! Baliyan, a hearing impaired since childhood, became the first Indian to have won a beauty pageant for the specially-abled (deaf). She was in Ahmedabad on Saturday at an interactive session organized by Apollo Hospital, where she shared her eventful and inspiring journey from being an athlete to a beauty pageant winner.

“Despite being hearing impaired since birth, the disability was detected when I turned 8. But soon, I started therapy and was gradually able to hear. My parents never enrolled me in a school for special children; and instead sent me to a mainstream school. That’s when I realized that I didn’t want my disability to be my weakness. I went on to pursue playing lawn tennis which interested me,” said 22-year-old Baliyan, who bagged two silver medals at the 2016 National Games in lawn tennis.

A year later, she stood fifth in the 2017 Summer Deaflympics. Even as she was forced to retire from lawn tennis – her only passion since childhood – because of a back injury; it did not impact her confidence. A year later, she began preparing for the beauty pageant.

“The secret to winning battles is inner strength. I believe that most hurdles can be overcome by turning one’s mind, which I did during that one year. Everyone who is hearing impaired must seek medical advice and treatment and should not feel embarrassed to use assistive devices as and when needed,” she further added.

According to experts, Indians are often not aware that hearing impairment is a disability that can be overcome with treatment and therapy. “Hearing impairment accounts for 20% of the disabled people in India. We want to spread awareness about hearing impairment and the importance of early detection of the disability so that timely medical assistance can be provided,” said Dr Rajesh Vishwakarma, president, Cochlear Implant Group of India.

MEERUT: Despite the ambiguous guidelines, Uttar Pradesh has become the first state to officially kickstart the implementation of controversial citizenship amendment act (CAA). In a report to the state home department, local administration in Hapur district have sent a list of 522 persons belonging to 120 families who have settled in Ganganagar and Premnagar area of Garhmukteshwar tehsil in the district.

In their testimonies, refugees claim that they had come to Kolkata from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1952 and later settled in Ganganagar and Premnagar areas of Hapur’s Garhmukteshwar tehsil in 1980s.

""Ganganagar resident Ganpati Vishwas (son of late Brijwasi Vishwas) in a statement claimed that his ancestors migrated to Kolkata from East Pakistan in 1952. Later, they spread to different parts of the country and 120 families relocated to Ganganagar and Premnagar areas of Garhmukteshwar tahsil in 1984-85. These families now have Aadhar card, pan card and bank accounts,"" the letter to additional chief secretary (ACS) home mentioned.

Despite massive protests in several parts of the country, UP has kickstarted the implementation of the controversial law. ""There are old reports, including that of then SSP Ghaziabad (Hapur was part of district Ghaziabad then) in 1993, where it was claimed that the refugees, who fled after suffering atrocities, have been staying since 1986,"" said Vijay Vardhan, sub-divisional magistrate (Garhmukteshwar).

""Even before the exercise of CAA began, these people have been approaching local administration claiming that they are facing difficulties in procuring identification cards and other documents essential for securing benefits under government schemes. Some of the testimonies of the refugees revealed that they migrated to Kolkata from East Pakistan in 1952 and later migrated to other places in country. Some of them also show old certificates that were issued to them at the time of migration,"" he said.

Meanwhile, other districts of Meerut zone are yet to warm up to the exercise. District administration in Meerut, Bijnor and Saharanpur categorically denied undertaking any survey to identify non-Muslim immigrants and refugees who could fit the criteria for citizenship under the new act.

NAGPUR: After a series of protest rallies that predominantly had Muslims’ participation, outfits representing SC/ST, OBC, Marathas and some civil society organizations announced forming an alliance to carry out anti-NRC/CAA movement.

A couple of events including a ‘cadre-training workshop’ has been planned in the city during this month. Contents of a document shared by one of the organizers indicates that the focus of the event will be to stress that the entire NRC-CAA exercise was being carried out in order to establish a Hindu nation dominated by the upper caste.

The key speakers include former high court judge B G Kolse Patil and former chairman of the University Grants Commission Sukdhev Thorat. Leaders of organization like Jamat-e-Islami-e-Hind along with Congressmen like Praful Gudadhe Patil and Baban Taywade will also take part in the sessions.

The first seminar will be held at Maratha Sewa Sangh on January 19 followed by another on January 29 at Vasantrao Deshpande Hall.

The paper forwarded as a prelude to the events said it needs to be examined whether NRC and CAA would impact only Muslims or whether other communities will be affected too. “If the government has shown a gesture of humanity towards persecuted Hindus from other countries by allowing them Indian citizenship, what about the treatment being meted out to SC/ST and OBC communities since centuries. They are the original inhabitants of India,” said the message.

Only to escape the persecution faced from upper caste, a large numbers of lower caste people converted to Islam and Christianity or became Buddhists in 1953. As many as 90% of the members of these communities who are otherwise original inhabitants of the country had converted into these religions, the document added.

“Who opposed the Mandal commission over reservations to OBCs, were they not Hindus at that time? Who kept the Dalits deprived of education,” asked the document in an indirect reference to BJP.

“The Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari questioned the opposition to the idea of having a Hindu nation if there are other countries having a state religion. However, it appears that the idea of Hindu nation is only to serve the interest of upper caste,” the document shared through social media said.

Support to the campaign has been pledged by 38 organizations that includes Jamat-e-Islami-e-Hind apart from some employees association and a number of Ambedkarite outfits.

A member of the Federation of Organisations for Social Justice , Secularism and Democracy, one of the organisations taking part in the event said the cadre training will involve awareness programmes on the law.

PUNE: A 36-year-old inmate of the Yerawada open prison disappeared from the jail premises on Friday afternoon. The incident came to light at night while counting of the inmates.

The open prison is located near the Yerawada central prison and is not fenced.

Prison officer Hemant Patil has lodged a complaint with the Yerawada police, stating that the inmate, ,Sanjay Ramjit Bhuiya (36) of Bokaro in Jharkhand, was working in the agricultural field when he managed to escape the prison.

“He was lodged in the barrack number 2 of the prison. Around 8.30pm, the prison authorities conducted a head count and subsequently it was found that Bhuiya was missing, following which an enquiry was conducted,” he said.

As per the FIR, the inmate was shifted to the open prison on September 20 last year from the central prison after he maintained his good conduct in the walled prison.

PUNE: A huge manpower crunch of community health workers in PMC limits has left the urban poor in the lurch.As per civic records, there are 564 sanctioned posts of community health workers or Ashas within the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. Of these, only 165 have been filled, leaving over 71% posts vacant. This turns out to be a huge setback for a city like Pune, which houses around 20 lakh urban poor, primarily from the slum areas.“The response to our recruitment drives of Ashas (Accredited Social Health Activists) has been poor over the years. This is because the money given to an Asha is incentive-based, which simply means it is calculated based on various sundry jobs that they do in a month. Considering the cost of living in the city, many workers find this amount measly,” Ramchandra Hankare, chief of the civic health department, told TOI.Ashas play a vital role in ensuring that the benefits of the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) — comprehensively known as the National Health Mission — reach the urban poor. “Over the past two years, we recruited 357 Ashas, but many left as they found the work to be less rewarding. Cities provide many job opportunities. Hence, women in cities are not ready to work on honorarium. A policy decision needs to be taken at the government level to increase the honorarium given to these workers,” Hankare said.The Centre determines the allotment of money to municipal corporations under NUHM, which then trickles down to urban local bodies via the state governments.Community health workers in the city area can earn up to Rs2,000 to Rs15,000 per month if they work for all health indicators, including child health and immunization, among others.Medical expert Vaishali Jadhav, head of the Pune NUHM, said, “As per the government diktat, we will decentralize the recruitment process of Ashas in the city.”Health activist Sanjay Dabhade said besides money, lack of motivation and will at the officer-level were among the reasons why urban poor were deprived of health benefits under NUHM in the city.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73370081,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-855492,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/71-asha-vacancies-strip-urban-poor-of-health-gains/articleshow/73363669.cms

PUNE: Residents of housing societies near the Sasanenagar railway crossing are up in arms over problems plaguing their area. They now demand a monthly compensation from the civic body to offset their daily troubles.Around 200 residents gathered at the crossing for a protest on Saturday to draw the attention of Pune Municipal Corporation to the daily traffic jams and unsafe road conditions there.The protesters said the commute on the road — a vital link between Sasanenagar-Sayyednagar and Handewadi — has turned unsafe. “The encroachments along the road are adding to the chaos,” one resident said.Last month, the residents had submitted a letter of complaints and demands to municipal commissioner Saurabh Rao, seeking immediate action. While submitting the letter, they had also warned of an intensified agitation, should the civic administration fail to address their complaints.Vaibhav Mane of the Federation of Housing Societies, Hadapsar, who headed Saturday’s agitation, accused the PMC of not doing anything substantial to resolve the woes, forcing people to take to the streets.“Over 200 residents from various societies, in a 3km radius of the crossing, participated in the agitation. Most of us are angry as they spend a lot of time at the crossing and suffer from massive traffic jams on both sides of the road regularly. PMC has not completed the subway project since 2013-14, though we were told that funds have been allotted,” Mane said.PMC had proposed subways to eliminate waiting at the crossing. Work started, but has progressed at a slow clip, further adding to the difficulties, residents claimed. They have demanded that PMC pay each affected family Rs15,000 per month as compensation.“Since we deal with traffic jams and other difficulties caused by the civic administration’s failure in resolving the issue, we want PMC to provide us compensation and declare us ‘railway crossing and traffic problem-affected’ residents. We pay taxes, but are deprived of civic services. Water shortage has been another issue plaguing the area,” Mane said.The protesters submitted a fresh memorandum to the civic officials at the Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward office. Sunil Yadav, joint commissioner at the Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward office, said that the municipal commissioner had visited the area on December 30, 2019, to review the situation and directed the authorities to complete the subway work by March 15.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73368417,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-812202,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-seek-monthly-compensation-from-pmc-for-woes-at-railway-crossing/articleshow/73363687.cms

ALLAHABAD: As all the openings on the three-kilometre divider on the busy GT Road have been shut by the district administration, the daily commute of a large number of students, businessmen and office-goers is hampered.

Local residents had shut their shops on Friday as a mark of protest against the administration’s decision.

The entire stretch of GT Road, from Mahilagram area (near Chaufatkaa) to PAC Battalion, Meerapatti is dotted with densely populated localities and markets, largest being Preetam Nagar. Besides, the road is also used by commuters going to the airport, headquarters of North Central Railways , students of IIIT-A, KV Jhalwa and employees of Indian Air Force (IAF) Bamrauli.

The divider, which has several openings for the ease of traffic flow in different directions, is shut since the past three days. The authorities said they took this step to prevent traffic jams due to the ongoing Magh Mela.

Despite the thin traffic of pilgrims on the first two bathing days, the openings remain barricaded by portable concrete slabs, thereby derailing the otherwise smooth commute of people.

For instance, a Preetam Nagar resident going towards Jhalwa or Subedarganj has to only cross the road through the opening near Dhoomanganj police station and his destination is only one kilometre away. But now he has to travel for around six kilometres to reach the other side of the road.

Same is the trouble caused to commuters going towards Bamrauli.

Excise department officials said they would investigate the other four other lounges — in Hinjewadi, Mulshi and Hadapsar — for serving liquor beyond the 1am deadline.The excise team that conducted the raid was headed by a vigilance team under the excise commissioner.“We received information that a newly opened lounge in Wakad was serving liquor without a licence. We went to the lounge and saw them openly sell liquor at the counter. The manager told us that the establishment had neither a licence nor a one-day permit to serve liquor,” D R Parab, inspector (flying squad), excise department, said.The team searched the premises and found a room next to the liquor counter, which had several kinds of liquor, including IMFL, scotch, wine, beer, fruit-based alcoholic drinks and champagne. “The manager was later arrested under the Maharashtra Prohibition Act, 1949, for illegal possession of liquor and the establishment’s bar was shut. The liquor seized from the premises amounted to Rs8.33 lakh. If this lounge has to sell liquor again, they would have to possess the necessary liquor permits,” Parab said.Parab further said the department has registered cases against the four other lounges. “A chargesheet has been filed in their names, after which the district collector will send them showcause notices. The administration will then take a call on whether to revoke their licences or levy a fine,” he said.The excise department is also keeping an eye out for other establishments that might be serving liquor without valid permits or operating beyond the liquor-serving deadline of 1am.A source from the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association said a lot of establishments in Hinjewadi-Wakad, Baner and Katraj serve liquor even till 3-4am. “While food can be served till 1.30am, the last order for liquor is 1am. But many bars flout this rule. Also, many lounges and bars in the city have been operating illegally without valid permits.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Activists have raised concerns over the Smart City project, alleging that they would benefit only 3% area of the Pimpri Chinchwad.

Representatives of NGOs in the advisory committee of the Pimpri Chinchwad Smart City Limited expressed this concern while addressing a press conference in Pimpri on Saturday.

Dhananjay Shedbale, a member of the advisory committee of the Pimpri Chinchwad Smart City Limited, said, “We have sent letters to the municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar, directors of Pimpri Chinchwad Smart City and local MLAs expressing the concern. We have also sent letters by Speed Post to chief minister and Prime Minister as well.”

He said, “The total outlay for Smart City projects is Rs 1,149 crore, of which Rs 593 crore is allocated for projects under area-based development component of the Smart City project. This money will be spent for the development of Pimple Saudagar and Pimple Gurav , which forms only 3% area of the city.”

Tushar Shinde of Pimpri Chinchwad Citizens’ Forum said, “There are 17 members in the advisory committee who are representatives of various NGOs. Their views are sought after the projects are already finalized, which is wrong.”

Thiruvananthapuram: Commander Abhilash Tomy , who had to quit the 2018 Golden Globe Race midway following a serious injury, is planning a second attempt in 2022. Interacting with students of Sainik School , Kazhakkoottam on Saturday, Tomy, who is the first Indian to complete a solo, unassisted and non-stop circumnavigation under sail as part of the Sagar Parikrama II project, said he wants another go at the demanding solo race.

“The first time I told my mother that I propose to circumnavigate the globe, she started crying. To console her, I said I would get married on my return. She couldn’t refuse. Today, she is very encouraging and the boat has become my second home,” he said.

There were questions about his family and the life threatening accident of September 2018 during the Golden Globe Race. “There was one storm which was really bad and that was the one which caught me. Otherwise, it was pretty much like I had anticipated. But this storm was a very nasty because it moved very fast over a vast area of the ocean,” said Tomy, recalling the accident which pummelled his yacht, Thuriya, and left him with multiple spinal fractures.

He said life at sea is less complicated than surviving on land. “When sailing, the resources you can carry along with you are limited. For the Golden Globe Race, a non-stop event where you cannot carry any modern equipment, more resources will only slow you down. But compared to problems on land, issues at sea are manageable. There you learn to manage with little resources,” he said.

On why he prefers to sail alone, Tomy said, “It’s not that I am against group task or anything like that. But spending extended periods of time in the space of a boat with the same set of people is very difficult for me.”

BHOPAL: Day two of the IAS Service Meet saw officers having a gala time with several sports and cultural activities lined up at Boat Club and Arera Club on Saturday.

“It was amazing to see so many people come out and make such wonderful delicacies at the event. It was a neck and neck competition as the participants gave their best shot.

I loved how everyone had a good time together,” said Sonali Mehta, ADM tourism, who was also the coordinator of the cookery competition.

“It was amazing to ride the dragon boat in the lake. The teamwork by all members of the house was remarkable,” said Manoj Shrivastav, chief secretary of culture department, who captained the Blue House. Officers teamed up in four houses — Blue, green, red and yellow — for the event.

To make the event interesting, this year, the IAS officers flew colourful kites in the afternoon during an event titled ‘patangbaazi. This rekindled in some officers fond memories of their childhood when they flew kites from the roofs of their houses.

Upending convention, another experiment this year saw Foot-cricket, where teams scored runs by kicking a football instead of hitting the cricket ball with a bat.

“This game is like a combination of football and cricket. Both cricket and football fans enjoyed it. This was a new experiment that we did this year,” said additional chief secretary of commercial tax and chairman of IAS Association, I C P Keshari.

As night descended, the teams sang songs in Antakshari. Quizzes gave everyone a chance to rack their brains.

The bus service and Metro connectivity to the airport will have to wait for now. The main objective is to create the infrastructure to ease the commute experience,” said Bapat, during a meeting held with the city airport officials recently.The bus services to the Lohegaon airport came to a halt in June 2019 after the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) incurred losses. The authorities also claimed that the change in the parking system at the airport in March last year had a direct impact on the termination of the services.For months before the MP’s statement, the PMPML and the airport authorities were holding talks to revive the bus services.Former PMPML chairperson and managing director Nayana Gunde, who was recently asked about the proposal to set up a terminus and the revival of bus services, had said, “The airport authorities have agreed to set up one such facility. Once it is constructed, the services would be functional again.”Given the MP’s recent remark, who is also the chairman of the Pune airport advisory committee, the plan seemed to have been effectively put on back-burner.The Pune airport director, Ajay Kumar, refused to elaborate on the MP’s remark. He, instead, said, “Every service is run on a commercial basis.”MLA Siddharth Shirole, the former director of the PMPML, reinforced that the bus services to and from the Lohegaon airport were not generating desired revenue.Frequent flyers remained unimpressed with Bapat’s downplaying of the proposal submitted.“What makes the politician think that the passengers coming to the city airport don’t use buses? If the service incurred losses in the past, it was mainly because the authorities never took its upkeep seriously,” said Vatsal Jain, a frequent flyer.Sanjay Shitole of the PMP Pravasi Manch said the authority’s apathy was responsible for the poor performance of the earlier service.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73370225,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-225386,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bapat-unimpressed-with-airport-bus-bay-proposal/articleshow/73363690.cms

KOCHI: The Kochi corporation ’s campaign against single-use plastic ( SUP ) seems to have stalled: No seizures of banned plastic items are being carried out nor are public awareness programmes being organized.According to corporation officials, they are awaiting the order of the Kerala high court , which is looking into the ban. “We will be able to act decisively only after the court gives a clear verdict on the issue. A case filed by a manufacturer against the ban is scheduled to be taken up on January 20. Until then, we are unable to take stringent action against the use of the banned items,” an official said. On why the local body is not organizing any awareness programmes for the the public, the official said, “It is up to the political leadership to plan such things. We officials have not role in such matters.”At the same time, health standing committee members said that it is up to the mayor, Soumini Jain, to clear their proposals. “The mayor has promised awareness programmes on the negative effects of single-use plastic,” committee chairperson Prathibha Ansari said.Local body authorities who say that they are waiting for a court order don’t have any clear answer as to why they are not taking action against those dealing in plastic carry bags below 50 microns. The government had banned the use of such carry bags a few years ago. “We have given strict instructions to officials to seize plastic carry bags below 50 microns ,” Prathibha said.Plastic carry bags below 50 microns are readily available at shops in the city. “The issue hasn’t been brought to our notice. We will ask junior health inspectors to look into it,” a top corporation official said.Interestingly, the Kochi corporation secretary is yet to delegate powers to allow health inspectors to slap fines on those violating regulations. As of now, the secretary alone can fine offenders. So, all the cases being booked will have to be brought to the notice of the secretary. This is resulting in delays and lower number of cases being reported. “The secretary will sign the order delegating the powers once the court gives a clear verdict regarding the use of banned items,” an official said....BLURBLocal body authorities who say they are waiting for a court order don’t have any clear answer as to why they are not taking action against those dealing in plastic carry bags below 50 microns, which were banned a few years agoENDS",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73367248,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-963521,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/city-corporation-drive-against-banned-plastic-grinds-to-a-halt/articleshow/73363662.cms

PUNE: The gold medal Tukaram Sannake had won for topping the BA (English) exam from Shivaji University , Kolhapur , in 2011 is gradually losing its shine, while quite a few years have passed since he completed his masters and MPhil degrees and cleared the National Eligibility Test (NET).

The 30-year-old man from Sangli now works as a temporary college teacher appointed on the clock-hour basis and is into some odd jobs for survival.

“I earn some extra money by working at a relative’s book store, my parents’ farm and as a freelance writer. I have been teaching for six years, but the stay on the teacher recruitment process is in place for almost three years now. Most of the colleges and universities are struggling to fill the vacancies,” he said.

Sannake, who had once aspired to be an English teacher, is currently pursuing PhD and is among hundreds of temporary teachers appointed on a clock-hour-basis in colleges across the state and have not been paid for their services since July 2019. Most of them are compelled to work as farmers ghost writers and private tutors.

As per a government resolution, the teachers appointed on a clock-hour-basis in bachelor courses should be paid Rs500 per hour with a maximum of 9 hours per week. This adds up to an income of around Rs18,000 a month.

“But I get paid Rs300 for a day’s work and I have to look after my parents and my wife. I have qualified both NET and SET (State Eligibility Test). I work as a daily wage agriculture labourer to support the family,” a BA (Hindi) teacher with a Kolhapur college said.

“It is sometimes depressing to ponder why I studied so much,” he said.

Another teacher from Kolhapur, Pravin Sorte (38), worked as an electrician at his village after clearing his Std X exams. He saved money, with which he completed his bachelor and postgraduate degrees in economics. “I have been working as a teacher for five years now. I first tried my luck with the MPSC and then switched to this, hoping for a secure job. Now I wonder if I should just leave everything and work as an electrician,” Sorte said.

The authorities also do not appear to have any words of hope for the likes of Sannake and Sorte. Mohan Khatal, joint director (Pune division) of the state higher education department, said, “We had told the respective universities to verify the number of temporary teachers appointed on a clock-hour-basis. Based on their reports, we have sent a bill to the higher education directorate for sanction.”

He added, “We will forward the rest of the bills only after the approval from the higher education directorate for clearance. The teachers’ salaries will then be credited. I am, however, not in a position to pledge the time the process will take. I have recently joined the department and will need to review the matter to get the exact number of temporary teachers in the division.”

Mulayam addressed party workers on Saturday after a long gap

LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav struck an emotional chord with yoing party workers on Saturday by saying senior leaders and veterans have to make way for the younger lot.

Addressing party workers at the party office on Saturday after a long gap, Mulayam said party needs young leaders and the old guard cannot carry the party on their shoulders beyond a decade.

The octogenarian was happy to see a crowd of youngsters among workers and gave them several tips on becoming a good leader.

Mulayam indicated that senior leaders cannot cling to posts for long and have to pave way for young leadership and said that young blood has to come forward to take place of aged leaders.

“Bhavishya mein party tumhare hathon mein hogi. Hum log kitne din tak yahan baithein. Kayee neta hain, koi 10 saal, koi 8 saal, koi 9 saal, koi 11 saal bhi ho sakta hai. Hai to party aap ki. Isliye tayyari kariye. (The party will be in your hands in some time. How long can we carry on. Those sitting here on the dais, some can lead for next 10 years, some eight, nine or maximum 11. The party is yours),” he told youngsters.

“So prepare for it, read the constitution of the party, ideology, regional language. Do not discriminate among castes, regions, gender. These are the things to focus on,” he added. He said shift of guard is visible everywhere and in other countries as well.

“Samajwadi Party has always welcomed change and is doing politics to bring change,” he said, adding the youth should know that country can progress only when farmers, youth and businessman prosper.

PUNE: Mumbai-based Chalet Hotels Limited (Chalet) said that it has signed a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) for the purchase of Pune-based Novotel Hotel and another affliliate entity for aggregate enterprise value of Rs 290 crore.

Chalet Hotels said, the aggregate enterprise value represents the base consideration, largely adjusted for net liabilities and cash for both the entities being acquired.

Novotel in Pune is a 223-room five-star hotel and has capacity to add another 88 rooms which are currently in bare-shell condition. The other entity that Chalet brought is Seapearl Hotels Private Limited (SHPL), an affiliate of Novotel.

Chalet Hotels spokesperson told TOI that the company will be fitting out the extra 88 rooms post the acquisition and is expected to cost Rs 22 crore.

Further, the company said that it will continue to work with the existing operating partner of Novotel i.e. AAPC India Hotel Management Private Limited (part of Accor Group).

“Chalet will work with the Accor team to improve market share for the hotel. Additionally we plan to complete the unfinished rooms and increase the room count to over 300 over the next 6-8 months. This increase in room count is expected to significantly improve financial performance of the hotel,” the company said in a reply to a TOI e-mail.

The hotel will continue as a Novotel post the acquisition and the company said that it has no plan to restructure the “hotel team as of now”.

""This move is in line with our growth strategy of strengthening and expanding our portfolio to new geographies with strong demand potential. We believe Pune is an attractive market and has sizeable commercial office development, resulting in a strong hotel demand dynamics,” said Sanjay Sethi, MD and CEO, Chalet Hotels Limited.

Experts and market players, peg the current occupancy rate in five-star hotels in the city at 60-70%.

PUNE: A 25-year-old man was rushed to a private hospital late on Thursday evening after he complained of being unable to breathe. He died due to intracerebral bleeding on Saturday morning. The police said that the man had been constantly engaged in an online game on his cellphone just before he was brought to the hospital.

The Dehu road police have identified the deceased man as Harshal Devidas Memane, a resident of Ravet near Dehu Road. Senior inspector Manish Kalyankar said, “The medical report states that Memane died due to intracerebral bleeding with brain tissue necrosis.”

The officer said Memane’s relatives told the police that he was continuously engaged in an online game over the last few days. “The relatives said that the game had many battlegrounds and several players,” he added.

“Late on Thursday afternoon, Memane was playing the game on his cellphone at his residence. Suddenly, he started making gestures and screaming. After screaming aloud, he became unconscious and his relatives rushed him to a private hospital,” Kalyankar said.

The police investigation has revealed that Memane would remain awake at night as he was engaged in the game. He had not slept properly over the last few days, the police said. The police has called in medical practitioners and other experts to investigate the case. Primarily, medical practitioners told the police that there was ‘high tension on the man’s brain nerves owing to heavy excitement caused by the game and due to sleep deprivation’.

The deceased man’s parents are farmers. “He took an interest in the game as he was unemployed. He had cleared his HSC examinations,” Kalyankar said.

Cong MLA Munnalal Goyal stagies a dharna outside a ssembly

BHOPAL: In a bid to remind the government about its promise to provide land pattas to poor, Congress MLA from Gwalior (East) constituency Munnalal Goyal on Saturday sat on a `dharna’ outside the state assembly building. Goyal had even boycotted the special House session on Friday. BJP was quick to latch on to the ‘fissure’ in the ruling party, with senior party leaders slamming the government for its apathy towards poor people in the state.

Before boycotting the special session on Friday, Goyal had shot a letter to chief minister Kamal Nath informing that he would sit in protest on Saturday. “I have tried to draw your attention to the issue of poor landless families as the government had promised to give land pattas to landless poor. But you have no time to listen to MLAs. I can understand your burden of work, but as MLA it is my job to take care of the people,” Goyal had stated in the letter.

Speaking to reporters outside the assembly gate on Saturday, the MLA said, “My protest is not against the government or against chief minister, as he has fulfilled many promises that the party made in the election manifesto. I have been repeatedly raising the issue of 1200 landless families in my constituency, but I have got no response from the government.”

Goyal said that he raised the issue in the state assembly and was assured that the matter would be addressed. “For six-months we have been waiting and no land patta has been given, neither has the process been initiated. Moreover, homes of poor are being razed to the ground. The government has completed one year and we have still not been able to give pattas to the landless poor which we promised in the manifesto,” he said.

Munnalal Goyal, known to be close to the Jyotiraditya Scindia, in his letter to the chief minister dated January 17, had said: “In Gwalior constituency, there are 1200 landless families who have been residents there for 20 years. They have no land pattas. The previous BJP government had conducted a survey for distribution of land pattas to landless. The government should cancel the survey and order a new one. Moreover, Gwalior ADM Anoop Singh has been misbehaving with Congress workers. There are numerous complaints against him and he should be transferred immediately”.

Reacting to the MLA’s dharna, state Congress spokesman Durgesh Sharma said, “Kamal Nath is very sensitive to issues regarding the poor and development of the state. Munnalal Goyal has made some suggestions which will be seriously considered by the government.”

Meanwhile, former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, leader of opposition Gopal Bhargav and state BJP president Rakesh Singh took to Twitter to slam the government over the issue raised by Goyal. In a tweet, Chouhan said that the ground reality has started coming to light gradually. “Now the ruling party MLAs have started protesting against the government. For how long, can the truth be covered in darkness. The state seeks a reply”, he said.

Bhargav tweeted that the “dumb and deaf government is not listening to its MLAs, forget about the opposition and public. Earlier it was MLA Sunita Patel and now Munna Lal Goyal is reminding CM about the promises he made. It is a fact that Congress MLAs are unhappy with the functioning of their own government”.

The state BJP president Rakesh Singh slammed the government for lawlessness in state. Referring to the Sagar incident where a Dalit Dhaniram Ahirwar was beaten and burnt on January 14, Singh said that the chief minister and ministers are silent over the issue.

As of now, Agra has a microbrewery

LUCKNOW: Lucknowites will finally get to sample locally brewed draught beer after April this year. Three applications for setting up microbreweries in the state capital are pending with the excise department, and are likely to get clearance on April 1, the start of the new financial year. Along with these, three more applications are set to get the nod for one microbrewery each in Agra, Noida and Bareilly.

Agra enjoys the distinction of being the first city in the state to get sanction for setting up a microbrewery when it got a nod in November last year. Since then, one more microbrewery has been sanctioned for the Taj city and another in Indirapuram, Ghaziabad.

“The MB-5 licence was issued to a restaurant in Agra for setting up a microbrewery under the newly-amended UP Brewery Rules of 1961. Since then, we have received more applications and are ready to give licences to six more units. Because the licence fee is applicable from April 1 to March 31 under the financial year system, the licences will be issued accordingly,” said a senior official in excise department.

Besides, the government is also planning to make its excise policy competitive with that of the neighbouring states of Delhi and Haryana. “If liquor is cheaper and available for more hours in Delhi and across the border in Haryana, those living in cities like Noida would cross over for their liquor supply. This would result in loss of business and revenue to us. Liquor is already highly priced in UP than in Delhi and we have to consider all these issues in the next excise policy,” the official added.

Ahmedabad: The AMC on Saturday sealed 12 shops located at Jankinandan Society in Nava Vadaj for illegal construction. “The shops were not in the original building plan,” said an AMC official.

“Someone had complaint to the AMC about the illegal construction and parking issues. Civic body officials sealed the shops in the morning. There is an internal dispute in the society which has resulted in the action,” said a shop owner.

Amar Patel, who owns five shops in the society, said, “I have documents of all my shops. I am surprised why the AMC sealed the shops without giving any notice.”

“I have been doing business at my shop for two years. There have never been any issue over documents. We have a proper space for parking too,” said a medical shop owner.

He said that one of the groups in the society is against redevelopment and another is for it. “This is the main reason for this move,” he said.

PUNE: Work on the long-awaited ropeway to the Sinhagad fort is likely to commence by February end, bringing down the journey time to the historical structure to just 5-7 minutes.The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) has already given its nod to the project, which is second such scheme in Maharashtra after the one at Raigad fort .Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is expected to lay the foundation stone for the project. Once completed, it would ferry tourists from Atkarwardi village to Doordarshan tower, covering a total distance of 1.8km.The PMRDA had earlier directed Shivai Krishna Ropeways, the agency involved in the project, to commence the work after receiving all the clearances and approvals. PMRDA officials said the project was pending since 2014-15 and it was only last year that the approval was granted to it, followed by other clearances.Shivai Krishna Ropeways had sought a chopper to speed up the project work. But, they have yet to get the official clearances from the aviation ministry. Director and chairman Udayraj Shinde of Shivai Krishna Ropeways said if the approval for using chopper was given, it could be completed within eight months, as against three years. “If chopper use is allowed, it will be the first in the country for such a project,” he said.The agency will involve Austrian company, Doppelmayr, for the ropeway. It had also provided its services for the similar project between Vaishnodevi and Bhairavnath temple at Katra in J&K.

Lucknow: Special Judge A K Ojha of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) court on Saturday granted seven-day custody of two directors of Amrapali Group, Anil Kumar Sharma and Shiv Priya, to ED for their interrogation. The custody period started on Saturday evening and will continue till January 24.

The special court passed the order on the application of ED which brought the two accused from Delhi jail on production warrant. Supreme Court had earlier permitted ED to interrogate the two in custody in pursuance of which ED had moved application before the special court.

ED’s special counsel Kuldeep Srivastava said the two directors are accused of misappropriating and diverting the money deposited by homebuyers to buy flats for their own personal use.

The ED is inquiring the matter on the directions of the SC which had passed an order in this regard on July 23, 2019. The SC had earlier got forensic audit of the company done and then issued directions for probe against the company.

Many investors had lodged FIRs against the company and its directors and officials. Later, the two directors were arrested and sent to jail.

In the alleged multi-crore fraud, the Amarpali group diverted money of 42,000 homebuyers.

The Lucknow zonal office of ED had registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 against the firm in July 2019.

An ED official said various projects at Noida and Ghaziabad are being probed since 2010. Besides, probe is also on to look into how officers gave permission to the firm for one project after another despite multiple complaints of non-completion of its projects.

“Our role is not only to find out where the money was diverted but also probe the channel through which crores were transferred,” he said.

Anil Sharma was grilled on Saturday while Shiv Priya will be questioned on Monday.

Women protest against new citizenship law at Clock Tower on Saturday

LUCKNOW: Sitting on a thin sheet of styrofoam with a blanket drawn up to her waist, 72-year-old Rabbo’s wrinkled face showed no tiredness as she chanted slogans of ‘azadi’.

Braving the winter chill and fog, the Husainabad resident was among a number of elderly women who had left their homes on Friday afternoon and spent the night in the open at Clock Tower to oppose the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise.

Inspired by the women in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, these first-time protesters, some along with their grandchildren, say that they will not move until their demand for revocation of CAA is not met.

“My parents and grandparents were born in India and they did not leave any papers for us to show to the government. We have assembled with our children and it is our fight for our rights,” she said, referring to NRC.

Ishat Jahan, 75, said she was protesting to support her nephew and many others arrested on December 19 after a protest against CAA in Lucknow had turned violent.

By evening, women from all faiths and ages had started to gather, pushing the number to 300. In the evening, some members of the Sikh community distributed tea and snacks among the people.

Holding posters of Mahatma Gandhi, BR Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh, women raised slogans of ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ and Ram Prasad Bismil’s ‘sarfaroshi ki tamanna’. Youngsters brought them food, tea, quilts and warm clothes.

“Police tried to stop us yesterday when electricity was snapped and public toilets were locked. A few people offered us their toilets to use. Today, they stopped men and even young boys from joining us. Since we do not want any violence, we appealed to them to stay back,” said Rahila, a protester.

Late in the evening, police personnel reached the site and allegedly took away blankets and water bottles form the women at the dharna site. Sdditional deputy commissioner of police (west zone) Vikas Tripathi said, “We did not take away any belongings from the protesters. We only stopped those who were setting up tents at the spot because it is not a designated dharna venue. Hence, such arrangements cannot be allowed.” Companies of RAF were also on guard at the spot.

140,['19/01/2020'],"It’s student anger, no end in sight, Kamal Nath warns on CAA","This story is from January 19, 2020

NEW DELHI: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath has warned BJP that there appears no end in sight for the seemingly unceasing protests against the CAA-NRC-NPR, saying that the agitation is in the hands of students who are angry over not just the divisive policies of the central government but also the economic collapse.

In an interview with TOI, Nath said, “It is difficult to say how long will the agitation continue once the students’ unrest starts. It shows their anger. The Citizen (Amendment) Act is only one manifestation of their anger. There are many reasons for their angst, the key being the prospect of a bleak future, their reduced purchasing power.”

Nath said the “divisive” CAA-NRC was cleverly introduced by the Modi government to divert attention from the economic mess but the tactic has compounded the anger of the people.

“It has been brought to divide the society and divert attention of people from a collapsed economy. But people of India are realising the motive of the BJP government They will not be thugged,” he said, adding: “The government is not talking about farmers, small business or traders. The fact is there is a complete collapse of economy and economic activity is at its lowest ebb.”

The comments from the CM of a state known as BJP stronghold suggest that the political class is not anticipating an end to the issue which has roiled the society and reduced the national debate to a single issue. However, there appears a bid by the Congress-led opposition to frame the CAA as a diversionary tactic of BJP, in a bid to divide the frame with politically beneficial and less polarising economic slowdown. It was also one of the major suggestions made in the recent meeting of Congress Working Committee and in of the opposition parties’ brainstorming last week.

“Is there a war going on? People have Aadhaar numbers, ration cards. What was the desperation to rock the boat?” he asked.

Strongly backing the opposition to CAA, the Congress veteran said contents of the law as well as omissions in it are dangerous for the society. “What is in the Act is bad but what is not in it makes it even worse. There are no safeguards in the law. People will not have documents like birth certificates of their father to prove their religion. And anyone can claim to belong to any religion or he can be wrongfully ascribed a religion,” he argued, suggesting that people would be at the mercy of officials in-charge of the exercise to identify citizens.

Nath said BJP will use the Union budget to further distract people. “I expect the budget to be a desperate one which will promise many things but nothing will be executed or be executable,” he said.

141,['19/01/2020'],4k women protesters step out for ‘second freedom struggle’,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Bengaluru: At least 4,000 women gathered at Eidgah-E-Jadeed on Tannery Road on Saturday to stage a protest against Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), National Population of Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). They called it ‘the second freedom movement’. The massive all-women crowd sang patriotic songs and called for solidarity with protesters across the country and with students of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Millia Islamia and other colleges.

Kanaka Chavan, a designer, told TOI the continuous struggle is unreal. “How is the government dismissing such a widespread movement as an Opposition tool? They are underestimating the power of people’s logic and overestimating Opposition’s grasp. They must stop being in denial and see the reality,” said Kanaka, who took half-day leave from work to participate in the protest.

Some like Amreen and Sara, both homemakers, left behind their children as young as two, to lend their voice to the stir. “We might be perceived to be conservative, but here we are stepping outside our homes, protesting for what is right,” said Sara.

Her relative Amreen said Kerala has shown the way by passing an anti-CAA resolution and they want Karnataka to follow suit. “They think we know nothing and are out protesting just like that. The truth is, they underestimate us because of the ‘purdah’, but it’s no hurdle to progressive thoughts. We are well-read and understand the divisive act and how the community is being sidelined,” said Abida Begum, also a homemaker, said saying that they are against anything that divides people and that they want ‘Azaadi from CAA’.

“In a way, this is the second freedom struggle,” Abida said. Khurath, a teacher, added that soon there’ll also be a civil disobedience movement. “We will not show any papers for NPR or anything related. There will be complete disobedience in such matters,” she said.

Talat Yasmeen, the state general secretary of Welfare Party of India, said this is not just for one community, but for all the oppressed sections of the country. “It’s to protect our Constitution and our rights,” said Talat.

Khurath and Abida said the government must focus on education, economy and employment rather than legislations that reflect ‘divisive’ ideologies.

“The Constitution is what protects us and we will fight for it. The combination of CAA, NRC and NPR will be devastating for millions people,” said MD Pallavi, a singer by profession.

Silent protest at Koramangala

Hundreds of people turned up for a silent protest near Forum Mall ,Koramangala on Saturday evening. The protesters called upon people to stand against NRC, NPR and CAA. It was organised by The Human Collective. Many who were present at the Tannery Road protest later joined the Koramangala stir. Kanaka, for instance, attended both the protests with two of her friends.

Student protesters denied permission

Meanwhile, high drama played our at Russell Market in Shivajinagar on Friday night after a group of students decided to stage a protest against CAA. Heated arguments broke out between students and police, who tried to disperse the crowd as they hadn’t obtained prior permission. Police threatened to initiate action and the crowd dispersed at 2:30am. Saqib Idrees from Bangalore Student Alliance, a student group, said they dispersed on Friday night after police promised to give them permissions for protest on Saturday. “However, when we approached them on Saturday, we were yet again denied permission.”

JABALPUR: Unidentified accused abducted a two-year-old girl from her house, while her parents were asleep in Jabalpur on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday. Cops are yet to trace the girl.

The incident took place at Bhairav Nagar under Tilwara Ghat police station of the district. The accused broke into the house by removing a pile of bricks in the makeshift wall.

“Monu Valmiki and his wife Preeti were sleeping with their two-year-old daughter Devika in their house at Bhairav Nagar. When they woke up on Friday, they found their daughter missing. Subsequently, they lodged a complaint with police,” Tilwara Ghat police station in-charge, Reena Pandey said.

“One wall of the house was made by piling bricks upon each other. It was not cemented and the bricks of that pile were removed. The accused had probably entered the house from that end. A case of abduction has been registered and investigations are going on,” Pandey said.

143,['19/01/2020'],Future leader’ from Uttar Pradesh learns from UK lawmakers,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Shambhavi Singh with UK MPs (extreme left & in green) and other FLC scholars at UK Parliament. The 50 ‘future ... Read More

Working as an assessor of public health facilities in remote villages of Uttar Pradesh, Shambhavi Singh had never thought her work would give her an opportunity to visit the UK Parliament, let alone address its members.

A public health researcher, the Lucknow girl had started out by conducting free health camps in deprived areas and schools of Lucknow. From there, she went on to villages in neighbouring districts and soon realized that pregnant women and infants were in the need of urgent care in the state.

With that becoming her focus, there was no looking back.

Shambhavi, 35, has led an evaluation of one of the most extensive community-based maternal and newborn health trials conducted in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and also presented her work at WHO headquarters in Geneva.

Apart from co-designing solutions for improvement of public health facilities in UP, she is also mentoring a team working in rural and tribal parts of Maharashtra to address address malnutrition.

An alumna of La Martiniere Girls’ College and City Montessori School, Shambhavi first trained to be a dental surgeon at King George’s Medical University. However, founding her calling elsewhere, she went on to pursue a master’s in public health from Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai.

It was while working under the Centre’s Kayakalp scheme for public health that Shambhavi got to know of the British Council’s Future Leaders Connect programme.

Being a platform for ‘young leaders’ to share policy ideas at a global stage, Shambhavi saw this is an opportunity to share her work as well as learn from other like-minded changemakers from across the world.

After a rigourous selection process, Shambhavi was selected among 50 candidates from India, Canada, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco, Tunisia, US and UK to visit UK and not only exchange ideas with other leaders working in fields of public policy but also visit prestigious institutions like Møller Institute and University of Cambridge, says director for north India at British Council Tom Birtwistle.

The jewel in the crown, of course, was a discussion at UK Parliament, meeting MPs themselves.

“FLC has has added immense value to my experience. It has helped me map my leadership skills and made me aware of my gaps. I shared with other FLC leaders the challenges that new mothers and infants in UP face on numerous issues. Now, I can reach out to my network to seek guidance, information and opportunities,” says Shambhavi.

She adds, “I interacted with Baroness Alison Suttie, a member of the House of Lords since 2013. We had a discussion on my policy ideas. In a session with Lord Desmond Browne (former member of the cabinet of UK) at the British Council office in London, we discussed leadership skills. His words that stuck with me are ‘spend a lot of time talking and discussing ideas and strategies with people who do not agree with them’. This is a quality every leader must have. Listening to senior leaders who had served at important positions in the UK government was a valuable experience.”

“The British Council has equipped me with the tools and skills to transform my community. The programme made me realise how we face challenges, shape our life journey. It allowed me to learn from global leaders and made me aware of the limitless opportunities. We should always think of ‘what more can I do’ to bring about a positive change,” she further adds.

Shambhavi also recently participated in the LonWHO 2019 (London World Health Organization) where the paper presented by her was adjudged the ‘Best Position Paper’ at EMRO, Eastern Mediterranean Region.

Additionally, some of Shambhavi’s ideas were presented in Research for Nutrition (R4NUT) conference held in Paris in November 2019 and as a continuation of this work, a new proposal has been developed and submitted to a competitive grant, the results of which are due to be declared in the coming weeks.

“With my training and experience, I am working towards finding strategies to improve quality of care in public health facilities, especially for mothers and newborn babies,” says Shambhavi.

Shambhavi has worked under the guidance of Dr Vishwajeet Kumar and Aarti Kumar, co-founders of Community Empowerment Lab (CEL), their team and experts from World Health Organisation. She has worked on two major large-scale studies- BetterBirth trial and Quality+ research, recently concluded at CEL.

144,['19/01/2020'],Madhya Pradesh: Security measures for SBI ATMs to counter rising frauds,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Representative image

BHOPAL: Alarmed with the rising cases of automated teller machine frauds, including cloning of debit cards, the State Bank of India (SBI), which has the maximum share of the ATMs across Madhya Pradesh , has come up with a massive operation to make them ‘tamper proof’.

Termed as “baseline cyber security controls for ATM switch application service providers of RBI regulated entities”, it is being introduced across all SBI ATMs .

SBI sources said work has been completed in almost 85% of the ATMs across the state. “The whole operation of making ATM mechanism “more robust and fool proof” is likely to be over by February 15”, said a senior bank official seeking anonymity.

As rising ATM frauds continue to victimise customers, an elderly retired government teacher was duped to the tune of about Rs3.50 lakh in Khurai town of Sagar district. The cops told that his debit card was cloned and cash withdrawn. Reports of a fraud committed by a Ugandan national in Bhopal has also sent shockwaves across the state capital.

There are about 630 ATMs in Bhopal, out of which 440 belong to the SBI. The number of SBI ATMs in MP is about 3,500.

ATM modernisation operation is being carried out under the supervision of the Reserve Bank of India , bank officials said, adding that it would require implementation of several measures to strengthen the process of deployment and changes in application software, continuous surveillance, implementation of controls on storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, building capacity for forensic examination, and making incident response mechanism more robust.

The RBI, bank sources said, had also mentioned these measures in its statement on ‘Development and Regulatory Policies’ released during its bi-monthly monetary policy review last month.

The e-surveillance is monitored centrally and alerts are sent immediately in case of an attempted tampering, sources emphasised. “Even the local police is also being involved in the process”, sources added.

Cameras are also being fitted inside the machines and the work is also being done on fast track mode, sources said. The idea is to enable the machines to detect and stop the moment tampering is attempted, they reiterated.

“One might have noticed that some ATMs are being shut for a period of time, this is actually done to modernise them”, sources added.

Around a couple of years back, when banks started withdrawing security guards from ATMs, Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) had raised serious concern. They also held withdrawal of guards responsible for the frauds.

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court has taken up the cause of residents of Sainikpuri, Kapra, Yapral and nearby areas affected by the foul smell emanating from Jawaharnagar dumpyard . The High Court took up a letter, written by Col. Sitarama Raju of JJ Colony narrating the woes of residents in these areas, as a Public interest litigation (PIL).

Along with the letter, Col. Sitarama Raju also enclosed a copy of an article published in TOI on November 12, 2019, highlighting the problems faced by the residents. The residents had complained that the stench is entering their houses, forcing them to keep the doors and windows shut throughout the day.

The dumping of garbage in Jawaharnagar dumpyard has now crossed 7,000 metric tonnes. Earlier, it used to be 5,000 metric tonnes. On its part, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) had identified three alternative locations — Lakdaram of Patancheru , Papireddyguda of Keshampet and Pyaranagar at Dundigal — to set up dumpyards. However, the civic body says that they are helpless because locals at these newly identified locations are resisting to their plan. Now, the GHMC says that it can only think of alternative methods of waste disposal at the existing dumpyard.

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy issued notices to the district collectors of Hyderabad, Medak and Ranga Reddy , commissioners of Kapra and Yapral municipalities and state pollution control board. The High Court has asked them to explain as to how they are planning to resolve this problem that is causing ill health to scores of people.

146,['19/01/2020'],Parking fee row: Sanjay Place traders flood AMC with RTIs,"This story is from January 19, 2020

AGRA: Traders of Sanjay Place market here who have been on an indefinite strike for the last five days on Saturday sent a barrage of Right to Information (RTI) querries to Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC).

RTI activist Naresh Paras, on behalf of the traders, submitted 30 RTI applications at AMC concerning the parking fee charged by the civic body in Sanjay Place, the commercial hub of the city. Besides, at least 300 shopkeepers are going to file RTIs on the subject next week.

Traders claim that AMC administration’s move to charge parking fee at 44 places in the market violates norms, as they had already paid a fee for parking at the time of purchasing the property.

The dispute over parking fee between traders of Sanjay Place and Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) is sub judice. The traders want AMC to cancel the parking contracts till the court delivers its final orders in the matter.

Talking with TOI, Naresh Paras said, “The civic body administration has failed to take cognizance of the traders’ protest and address their legitimate questions over charging parking fee in Sanjay Place. Therefore, traders have decided to make them answer using the RTI Act. All the shopkeepers of Sanjay Place will make RTI queries with AMC.”

On Saturday afternoon, the traders staging dharna in the parking area raised slogans against the AMC administration and created a racket by beating empty utensils. Traders also criticized Mayor Naveen Jain for “backing the parking mafia”.

Hiren Agarwal, secretary of the Sanjay Place Market Association, said, “AMC has flouted norms, as traders of Sanjay Place market has already paid a fee forparking space at the time of purchasing property. It is clearly written on the registry available with the shopkeepers. The details sought under the RTI Act will reveal all the malpractices being done by the AMC administration to exploit the traders and common people.”

Association's treasurer Vinay Mittal alleged, “Despite the ongoing case at the sessions court, AMC administration had issued parking contracts for three years to people associated with BJP. AMC officials also get a share of the parking fee illegally collected from the market. We will not withdraw our protest till the AMC rolls back its decision.”

Meanwhile, BJP councilors Amit Agarwal and Deepak Agarwal along with a few businessmen organized a press conference in favour of the parking system enforced by the AMC in Sanjay Place. They said it will help curb vehicle theft, which is a major problem in Sanjay Place. Besides, systematic parking of vehicles in the busy market will ease traffic congestion.

Premadas Jalaram Hospital

VADODARA: A city-based hospital has come under the scanner after it allegedly botched up medical reports of kidney patients who come to the hospital for dialysis, showing them to be HIV positive.

After the anomaly surfaced, the state health department on Saturday suspended Premadas Jalaram Hospital’s affiliation for Mukhyamantri Amrutam (MA) yojana for its alleged negligence in preparing the reports.

Sources said that reports of five patients who have their dialysis done regularly at the hospital located on Harni-Warasiya Road were shown as HIV positive in December. The patients, all from poor financial backgrounds, lodged their complaints on ‘MA’ scheme’s toll number.

The MA scheme – a health insurance initiative by the state government - was introduced so that poor families could avail best medical treatment even at private hospitals.

Following the complaints, a two-member officials’ team from Gandhinagar visited the hospital and directed it to clean up its dialysis machinery and install fresh equipment. Interestingly, while that was under way, medical reports issued by the hospital for 14 other dialysis patients’ showed them as HIV positive, sources added.

Hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Deepak Desai admitted of “human error” in the patients’ medical reports.

“It was a human error which had surfaced in one cycle, but it had been rectified immediately. It wasn’t an intentional error.

148,['19/01/2020'],Pongal bird count to end today,"This story is from January 19, 2020

PUDUCHERRY: An annual exercise to identify bird species in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry jointly undertaken by the Tamil Birders’ Network (TBN) and Bird Count India (BCI) during Pongal season commenced on January 16. The exercise will conclude on January 19.

TBN and BCI have been identifying and counting species of birds spotted in the regions since 2015. Every year, they submit reports of their findings to several organisations and podiums, including eBird India portal , an online platform for bird watchers to register their observations in a systematic manner. The exercise aims to understand the movement of winged species and the need to protect them.

Surendhar Boobalan, TBN coordinator for Puducherry and Cuddalore, said that this year, birders from Tamil Nadu and Puducherry began documenting the species and counting their numbers from January 16. They will submit their observations to eBird at the end of the exercise. “The exercise is a part of worldwide effort to document birds globally and make bird watching popular and scientific,” Boobalan said.

Last year, birders from Salem, Coimbatore, Kancheepuram, Villupuram and Puducherry registered the maximum count of birds. The birders from the central and southern districts of Tamil Nadu came out with a relatively lesser number of species in their regions.

Tamil Nadu and Puducherry have more than 500 species of birds. The 2019 exercise reported the presence of 362 species in the first four days in the two regions. There were 209 birders involved in the exercise last year and each spent on an average of seven hours and eight minutes on the project. Coimbatore (42) witnessed the highest number of participants followed by Kancheepuram (27) in the exercise undertaken last year.

“House crow was the most common resident bird appearing in 57.4% of all checklists followed by common myna (48.5%), large-billed crow (42.8%), black drongo (39.5%) and rose-ringed parakeet (36.7%). The most common migrant appearing in 32.3% of the checklists was Blyth’s reed warbler followed by barn swallow (24%), blue-tailed bee-eater (14.1%), wood sandpiper (10.1%) and common sandpiper (9.12%),” said Boobalan.

Inviting people to participate in the annual exercise, he said eBird portal furnishes complete resource material on how to prepare bird checklists in English and Tamil. “Seasonality, occurrence and distribution of even common birds are poorly known. Hence, identifying and counting birds can help us understand the winged species better and protect them,” he said.

149,['19/01/2020'],BSY-Shah meet fails to break stalemate,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Bengaluru: The long-awaited discussions on cabinet expansion finally took place between BJP national president Amit Shah and the state party unit on Saturday, but they produced no result.

Latest indications are that new members will be appointed only after CM BS Yediyurappa returns from Davos, Switzerland, on January 25.

The party held a close-door party meeting at a top hotel in Hubballi. The subject of expanding the cabinet, which currently has 16 vacancies, featured in the talks.

Earlier, Yediyurappa reportedly had a one-on-one with Shah during their 45-minute flight from Bengaluru to Hubballi. He is said to have insisted on accommodating all 11 newly MLAs in the cabinet. These legislators were earlier a part of Congress and JD(S); they contested the December byelections on BJP tickets and won.

This apart, BJP sources said, Yediyurappa and Shah had a brief chat at a private event at Palace Grounds . Separately, Shah, who is the Union home minister, held meetings with Jagadish Shettar, Laxman Savadi and Prahlad Joshi, seeking their views on cabinet expansion.

Shah also wanted to get an idea of what people think about the Yediyurappa government’s performance.

Newly elected MLAs Ramesh Jarkiholi, BC Patil and Srimanth Patil greeted Shah. “We only met him to wish him; we didn’t discuss the cabinet issue. That’s something state BJP members will do,” said Hirekerur legislator BC Patil.

Saturday’s deliberations fail to break the stalemate over the cabinet appointments. There are clear differences in the camp about whether all Congress-JD(S) defectors should be made cabinet members, according to a senior minister attended one such meeting.

Shah reportedly wants only seven to eight newly elected MLAs to be made ministers; the rest of the spots should go to BJP loyalists. Yediyurappa disagrees with this position as he had promised all 13 turncoats places in the cabinet. Two lost in the bypolls.

Shah has now asked Yediyurappa to visit Delhi after returning from Davos to finalise the composition of the cabinet, according to the sources.

Yediyurappa will leave for Davos early on Sunday, while Shah will fly directly to Delhi from Hubballi.

152,['19/01/2020'],Bihar: Congress floats Meira Kumar's name for CM post,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar

PATNA: Congress has jumped into the Mahagathbandhan leadership fray in Bihar with a section of its state leaders on Saturday floating the name of former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar as a possible CM face for the coming assembly polls.

RJD had sparked a tussle within the alliance recently by declaring leader of opposition and party chief Lalu Prasad’s younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as the CM face for the assembly election likely to be held by the end of this year.

“Some people often say that our party does not have a CM face. Let me tell you Congress has no dearth of leadership and no one is better than Meira Kumar here. I don’t think anyone can match her capability here,” Congress MLC Prem Chand Mishra told TOI. Mishra’s assertion was backed by the Congress Legislature Party leader in the assembly, Sadanand Singh. “He (Mishra) has not said anything wrong. But the final decision will be taken by the high command,” Singh said.

On RJD’s decision to put forward Tejashwi’s name, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary and Kadwa MLA Shakeel Ahmad Khan said it is their individual decision and not that of the alliance. “First a co-ordination committee needs to be formed, which will decide the name of the CM candidate. Final decision in Congress will be taken by our high command,” Shakeel added.

Congress floating Kumar’s name is significant in the light of HAM (S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi’s formula that there should be one CM and two deputy CMs of whom one should be a Dalit, one backward and one from the minority community.

However, Manjhi’s party remained tight-lipped over Meira’s candidature on Saturday. “Every party in the alliance has a CM face. Even we have one. But the final decision will be taken in the coordination committee meeting,” said HAM (S) national spokesperson Danish Rizwan.

RJD state general secretary Alok Mehta, too, avoided commenting on the issue. “We will all sit together and decide over it. But RJD’s stand is clear that Tejashwi is will be our CM face in the assembly elections,” Mehta said.

RLSP national spokesperson Fazal Imam Mallick too had recently pitched the name of his party chief Upendra Kushwaha as the “most suitable” CM candidate.

Representative image

INDORE: As it stands, it’s heading towards a stand-off between IMC and IDA over property tax dues. Civic body calculated property tax dues of Indore Development Authority (IDA) at Rs 120cr and shot a demand letter for recovery. But IDA officials claimed that Indore Municipal Corporation owes them a bigger amount if all transactions are adjusted including allotting plots to civic body and final balance sheet is a taken out.

According to IMC additional commissioner (revenue) Krishna Chaitanya, “A demand letter to IDA has been issued for payment of around Rs 120 crore as property tax due for its different schemes. The calculation has been made on basis of number of property IDA has brought to sale and other construction activities and development of schemes undertaken by them.”

He added that IDA has come out with a specific issue saying that in some proposed schemes, they have only entered into agreement with farmers and liability of paying property tax will come into picture after colonies are ready for sale.

“Even after considering the same, IDA will have to pay around Rs 75-80 crore as property tax due for its different schemes” he said adding that if the dues are not cleared in days to come, they will escalate the matter and resort to appropriate actions required to be taken as per IMC rules.

In reply to the notice, senior IDA officials said that there are many ‘mistakes’ in the notice as IMC has generated recovery on many schemes including 169 and 169A on Super Corridor, which are not even developed and handed over, thus property tax can’t be demanded for it.

Besides, IDA has allotted some plots to IMC including that at Vijay Nagar for developing ISBT worth around Rs 78 crore and after calculating the same and adjusting it against IMC’s ‘actual’ demand, IDA will generate a recovery from the civic body, officials claimed.

IDA CEO Vivek Shrotriya told TOI, “IDA and IMC are responsible public institutions and many transactions are done between them. IDA has to pay property tax for its schemes to IMC but the former also has a recovery against civic body against allotment of plots to it. We will reconcile things in days to come and therefore, I am writing a letter to IMC officials concerned.”

ARA/PATNA: The body of an 18-year-old girl was found near a railway track barely 500m from a police station in Bhojpur district around 5am on Saturday. Hours later, a 20-year-old youth, said to be the girl’s boyfriend, committed suicide by hanging himself from a ceiling fan at his house.

Police said Mukesh Kumar killed himself fearing his arrest in connection with the murder of his girlfriend Ratan Kumari, whose half-naked body was found in haystack at a village under Tiyar police station. The body bore bullet injuries on the neck. Both bodies were sent to Ara Sadar Hospital for autopsy.

The girl’s family had suspected the involvement of Mukesh, resident of a neighbouring village in the district and had named in the FIR lodged by the family. A police team reached Mukesh’s village soon only to find him dead.

Mukesh’s uncle, mukhiya of the local panchayat, told police that Mukesh must have committed suicide after he came to know that his name figured in the FIR.

“Pieces of hay were found stuck in Mukesh’s clothes indicating his presence at the spot where the girl’s body was found early morning on Saturday,” Bhojpur SP Sushil Kumar said.

The SHO of Tiyar police station, Harendra Prasad, said Mukesh was named in the FIR lodged by the girl’s brother. A love affair is stated to be the reason behind the incident. The police are yet to recover the murder weapon.

Police said the girl’s body was first spotted by some people on their way to catch a train at Sikariya railway station under Danapur railway division. They informed Jagdishpur SDPO Shyam Kishore Ranjan.

The SDPO said bloodstains were found at the spot, adding an FSL team has collected evidence and the forensic report is awaited.

Ch Kaseem

HYDERABAD: Professors at Osmania University (OU) described associate professor Ch Kaseem as a good teacher who actively participates in all the programmes on the campus. They said he is a person with an extremist view and left ideology.

OU registrar Ch Gopal Reddy said Kaseem never created any problems on the campus. “He was always courteous and never created any problem in the varsity,” said Reddy, adding that he was recently promoted as chairperson of the board of studies.

Kaseem, who joined the Telugu department at OU in 2013, initially maintained a low profile. “As he was mostly silent, we did not hear much about about him earlier,” said E Suresh Kumar, who was OU registrar between 2014 and 2016.

However, people who knew him closely said he was leftist and was against Brahmanical patriarchy and Hinduism. “He is an extremist and was against Hinduism and Hindu culture,” said a retired professor of Telugu department, adding that he became more active after joining Virasam.

Research scholars from OU said Kaseem took active part in all the protests on the campus. “He was part of the Telangana movement. He supported Dalits and took active part in their events on the campus. Almost every day, he used to give speeches in one programme or another,” said a student of Telugu department, who completed his PhD.

They also said that Kaseem strived hard to improve the research work of his students and as a young professor, he took many initiatives to help students of Telugu department.

Before joining OU, Kaseem worked at Oriental College – Andhra Saraswatha Parishath. He also worked at the Nizam College.

INDORE: A revenue team of district administration on Saturday faced resentment from property owners in Tulsi Nagar, where they marked around 85 structures, plots developed by allegedly encroaching upon government land.

As part of ongoing crackdown against land mafia, district administration has taken up the issue of plots, property allegedly developed by encroaching upon government land in Tulsi Nagar. The court of tehsildar Mamta Patel had recently ordered demarcation of encroached land, which is likely to be freed in days to come. To this, property owners had requested court to carry out demarcation process in their presence and subsequently, Patel had fixed date of January 18.

As per schedule, a revenue team led by revenue inspector Vishal Sharma and patwari Sapna Choudhary reached the spot and showed property owners the demarked areas showing encroachment on government land from 10 to 50 feet. To this, affected people claimed to have bought the plot from colonizer Shivnarayan Agrawal and he should be made accountable for encroachments .

“Agrawal through Maa Saraswati Housing Cooperative Society had developed Tulsi Nagar and sold plots. We are residing in the area and carrying out business from over 10 years as we were not aware of it being developed by encroaching upon government land. Instead of taking actions against property owners including removing structures, the colonizer should be punished,” the affected people said.

The revenue team asked property owners to appear before tehsildar court in next hearing fixed on January 23 to register their grievances.

Meanwhile, some members, whose name are there in seniority list of five housing cooperative societies, turned out on second day of three-day camp in collectorate and deposited money against plots, which will be allotted to them in days to come.

Vadodara: For the last two years, he was preparing for this moment. And his efforts paid off well as Nisarg Chadha’s name featured among nine candidates from across the country who have scored 100 percentile in the Joint Entrance Examination Main 1.

Son of a doctor couple, Nisarg has been an exceptional student at Navrachana School, Sama, right from class one. “Before two years, I had started preparing for JEE but the focus was on JEE (Advanced). It was only in last two months that I started thoroughly preparing for JEE Main,” said Nisarg, son of urologist father Amit and doctor Amola Chadha.

Nisarg who wants to pursue research in physics is exploring under graduation either from IIT Bombay or IISc, Bangalore.

The 17-year-old who had topped his school in class X with 98% in 2018 concentrated on solving last year’s papers and test series.

“Since the beginning, I was thorough with NCERT textbooks which helped me a lot,” said Nisarg, who firmly believes that taking breaks to freshen up and pursue hobbies is equally important.

“For me it was reading and listening to music. My school also helped me a lot to reduce stress,” he said. An all-rounder and a keen quizzer, Nisarg is also a Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana and National Talent Search Examination scholar.

Nitin Gadkari

INDORE: An import substitute economy has to be developed to achieve $5 trillion economy , which is difficult but not impossible, said Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday.

Speaking on concluding day of 29th International Management Conclave organised by Indore Management Association , Gadkari said, “Our country has plenty of resources and production capacity. Despite that we are spending crores every year on importing goods like medicines, medical devices, coal, copper, papers. An import substitute economy needs to be developed. The vision of $5 trillion economy is difficult but not impossible.”

Gadkari said almost everyday meetings are happening at PMO to discuss measures to improve infrastructure, transport among others. The transport minister stressed on financial management for reducing cost, boosting exports and strengthening micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

“There was no lack of money, resources and technology in the country but lack of appropriate vision and implementation is a problem,” he said. Addressing industrialists, Gadkari said one does not need to be an expert in the field but vision, knowledge and decision-making qualities are important.

He said technology and management can turn waste into wealth and Indore is progressing on this sector.

Speakers discussed components to be included in drafting roadmap for $5 trillion economy while one speaker raised question on impact of this ambitious goal on rural economy. Deepak Satwalekar, a venture advisor asked if this is the right goal for the country. Satwalekar said, “The role of the government should be to ensure welfare, wellbeing of people and create jobs for youth. The goal should be a means to serve larger group of people.”

Satwalekar said India needs a different model to support rural economy that has supported growth of the country.

Speakers stressed on need to engage with MSMEs and look into their problems as the sector is the largest employment generator.

The students shouted slogans against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register and took out a tricolour balloon march. The protesting students alleged that the VC and registrar were responsible for the atrocities they suffered on campus as the latter had allowed police to enter in it.

Talking with mediapersons, students’ leader Faizul Hassan said they will continue their protest against them (VC and registrar) till the duo quit their posts. He said students are not impressed by the explanation offered to them by the VC, when he visited the protest site.

While interacting with students, VC Mansoor had told them that he deeply regretted that students suffered injuries and the inconvenience they faced when they were asked to vacate hostels. He also said the police entry was an aberration and the university should function on its own.

Meanwhile, AMU vice-chancellor Mansoor has constituted a seven-member committee on Saturday in order to open a dialogue with students. The committee will look into the matter of FIRs lodged against students, compensation to the injured students and other grievances relating to the incidents which took place on the intervening night of December 15 and 16.

MUMBAI: Senior citizens may get a chance to travel comfortably in local trains as Central Railway is considering a plan to convert one luggage compartment into an exclusive coach for the elderly.

Senior citizens have 14 reserved seats in every train. The seats, though, far from suffice the large number of senior citizens who travel by train. A railway official said, “We realise that 14 seats in an entire 12-car train are not enough. Hence, we are considering a plan to convert or reserve one luggage compartment for senior citizens.”

As CR has four luggage compartments, officials said allocating one for seniors may not be an issue for vendors.

Luggage compartments take away 6.2% of the space in a 12-car rake but carry merely 0.3% of the passengers. By comparison, general coaches occupy 71% of a train’s area but carry 90% of passengers.

The official said, “This figure reveals that there is not much scope in a general coach as it is already overcrowded, whereas the luggage compartment is underutilized. So, it is better to have one luggage compartment set aside for senior citizens.”

CR has two compartments reserved for the differently abled, each with 19 seats.

The official said, “We will consult workshops to check the feasibility of reserving one such coach for seniors. We will first undertake this exercise in one rake for the purpose of a trial. If successful, it can be replicated in the remaining rakes.”

In 2014, a Bombay high court division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice A S Gadkari heard a suo motu PIL, which was converted out of a letter written by A B Thakker urging reservation of a separate compartment for senior citizens. Following the petition, in January 2015, HC directed Western and Central railways to reserve 14 seats exclusively for seniors in suburban trains and ensure these are not occupied by others.

Senior citizen Jayesh Damania said, “An entire compartment is welcome as we find it impossible to get into a general coach.” Another senior citizen, Ramesh Walavalkar, said, “Seats reserved for us are occupied by others. A verbal duel breaks out sometimes if we ask people to vacate reserved seats for us.”

INDORE: A pregnant woman suffering from cancer and the foetus got a new treatment protocol after recommendation of by Multidisciplinary Tumour Board (MTB) of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College — a move that was not possible four months back till the board was constituted on October 17 last year.

After setting up of the board following international protocol to treat cancer patients, it became first medical college in state to have it at a government cancer treatment facility. The patient was among many, who have received specialised attention after their cases were heard by tumour board.

The woman, a resident of Indore, was suffering from a sarcoma of 25cm length and was unable to walk or even stand on her legs. Because of her pregnancy, doctors were unable to treat her with chemotherapy or any traditional ways of treating cancer.

The board after examining her advised for palliative therapy by prescribing symptomatic medicine, which are drugs used to relieve symptoms associated with pain to avoid any harm during pregnancy, said Dr Ghanghoriya.

Since its constitution, the tumour board recommended line of treatment for 57 rare cases of cancer during its weekly meeting, which happens every Thursday, said Ghanghoriya. Ghanghoriya said, “Clinical cases, including laboratory, imaging, and pathology findings are presented before members, who after discussion recommend line of treatment for patients.”

166,['19/01/2020'],Boats resume service in the Krishna from Vijayawada to Bhavani Island,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Vijayawada: Four months after the Godavari boat mishap, Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) flagged off its boat services in Krishna river between Vijayawada and Bhavani Island . Addressing a press conference, tourism minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao explained that port officials from Machilipatnam had inspected five of the 15 boats available with APTDC in Vijayawada and issued NOCs.

Upon receiving the NOCs, these boats will now be allowed to ply in the Krishna river. “We are keeping tourist safety as an utmost priority in this scenario. Port officials will also be inspecting private and public boats and will issue permissions accordingly,” Rao said while addressing a room full of reporters.

However, while the boat services have been resumed, it is also pertinent to note that the Bhavani Island has had restricted access since August 2019 due to the devastating damage caused by the Krishna river floods.

When STOI visited the island, it wore a haunted look. From dead leaves strewn across the island and skinny and starving dogs, to a lack of amenities, the entire premises is not even ready for basic sightseeing by tourists. Bhavani Island, which is one of the most sought after getaway destinations for residents of Vijayawada, witnessed substantial damage as Krishna river flood waters gushed inside the premises.

Speaking to STOI, Pravin Kumar, managing director of APTDC explained that they would begin cleaning the premises and set it up for basic sightseeing within a week. “We will first focus on completing work that can be done in a week like landscaping, fixing broken tiles on the footpaths and removing the decayed leaves. After that, we will slowly begin the restaurant and other tourist activities on the island such as the light and sound show and joy rides,” Kumar added. Overall, Rs 1.77 crore is expected to be spent in renovating Bhavani Island.

Meanwhile, officials are also waiting for Machilipatnam port officials to hand out the remaining licences to public and private boat operations to boost tourism in the island.

Cops give warm clothes to civic workers

INDORE: In a unique initiative, a team of police officials — Thand Ke Sipahi — roams around in the night distributing warm clothes to needy people.

The initiative was taken by Azad Nagar police station in charge, which was followed by several inspectors.

Sanjay Sharma said that a team of policemen from Azad Nagar on night duty takes out half an hour and roams around the streets with blankets and sweaters for people they find in need of warm clothes.

The initiative was started for Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) sanitation workers, who clean roads late night.

“This is the only way in which we can recognize hard work that these workers do in jittery cold. Because of them Indore will soon be the cleanest city in the country for the fourth time. Our constables had seen that many of these workers wear very thin warm clothes and so they had decided to help them,” said Sharma.

Sub-inspector Priyanka Alawa and Anila Parashar were some of the police officials of Azad Nagar, who carried out this drive, which was then followed in different parts of the city. They decided to call themselves Thand Ke Sipahi.

Sharma also said that they distributed clothes to the needy and homeless people on streets and asked them to go to Rain Basera developed by administration.

SSP Ruchi Vardhan Mishra also appreciated efforts made by police officials of Azad Nagar police station.

“Such efforts are always appreciated. More and more people should come forward and do good for society,” she said.

169,['19/01/2020'],BRTS corridors’ removal will have negligible impact: Experts,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Traffic near the BRTS corridor on Sikar Road in the city on Saturday

JAIPUR: At a time when the state government is planning to make city roads free from the Bus Rapid Transit System ( BRTS ) corridors, many town planners and engineers believe its removal will in no way significantly improve the traffic condition.

The 7.3-metre-wide corridors are situated on the roads where the width of motorable passage is 45 metres. Experts believe that further widening of roads after demolishing the corridors for cars or two-wheelers will not bring a drastic change in the present situation.

A senior official of Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) on condition of anonymity said, “The capacity of two lanes is 1200 PCUs (passenger car units). When number of cars exceeds the road capacity (volume to capacity more than 1), a high-capacity transport system is required including BRTS, Metro etc.”

As bus transport is cheaper as compared to the Metro, experts believe the government should make efforts to make the existing project feasible, rather than demolishing the corridors in the city. “In Jaipur, the annual loss of the Metro is approximately Rs 24 crore (monthly loss of Rs 2 crore) and its average rider-ship is nearly 20,000. The government is providing subsidy of approximately Rs 100 per passenger. While the Jaipur City Transport Services Limited (JCTSL) loss is approximatively Rs 3.25 crore and it caters to 1.80 lakh passengers per day. Subsidy of Rs 6 per passenger is being provided by the government,” said a source, who is an engineer.

Sources said, accidents near the corridors occurred due to lack of enforcement, not because of faulty planning or lesser width of the road. “Sikar Road, Ajmer Road and New Sanganer Road were two-laned on either sides (total 4 lanes) when BRTS corridor was constructed.

Now, there are three lanes on either side of the corridor. If the corridor is removed, movement of buses along with traffic is expected to cause more accidents,” added the official.

Many opined that the project would have been feasible if the entire BRTS network was laid. Till date, JDA has constructed 7 km on north-south corridor (Sikar Road) against the sanctioned 26 km. Similarly, against the sanctioned 13 km, only 8 km has been constructed on east-west corridor. The project could easily provide swift passage between Khatipura Mod and the airport. It could also turn into an easy mode of commute between Sikar Road and Railway Station. “It was proposed to ply 100 buses in BRTS corridors for commuters, but that never happened. The project would have been successful if concrete decisions had been taken,” said the official.

While the state government is planning on the removal of the BRTS corridors, the project cannot be uprooted without Centre’s permission, as 50% grant was provided under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.

JAIPUR: The body of a cab driver, who was shot dead in Dausa ’s Baswa police station area on Friday night, was found on Saturday morning.

According to initial investigation, the driver was shot in the chest by a couple from Haryana after he refused to be part of a kidnapping bid . Police have detained an acquaintance of the deceased, who was also in the car along with couple when the incident happened.

The deceased was identified as 35-year-old Vishnu Nath who hailed from Alwar.

Dausa ASP Anil Chauhan told TOI, “The married couple, Ravindra and Seema, came from Panipat to Alwar to meet their friend Subhash, who was also known to the deceased. The couple said they wanted a car and a driver to go to Baswa and Subhash got Vishnu to drive all of them there on Friday morning.”

Police detained Subhash and during questioning found that around three months ago, Ravindra had eloped with a girl from a village in Dausa district. A case had been registered against him, but was withdrawn when the girl who he eloped with said she went willingly with him.

“It appears that Ravindra along with his wife and Subhash had come back to Baswa area to find the girl. After reaching, they got a bike and for most of the day Subhash and Ravindra did a recce of the village where the girl resided. Ravindra’s wife also knew of this and on Friday late night, when the trio asked Vishnu to take them to the girl’s village in his car, he refused following which they had an argument and Ravindra shot him in the chest,” added Chauhan.

After this, the husband and wife absconded from the spot on the bike which they dumped some distance away before either taking a bus or train to get away. Subhash was found and is currently being questioned to trace the whereabouts of the other two.

The official added, “It is unclear why they wanted to kidnap the girl and further investigation will reveal the motive.” Vishnu’s body was handed over to the family after the post-mortem.

Farmers, officials spray insecticides on a tree.

SRIGANGANGAGAR/BIKANER: Following fresh swarms of locust seen at villages under Sriganganagar’s Gharsana and Bikaner’s Khajuwala tehsils, farmers have now demanded aerial spray rather than tractor-mounted drums to spray pesticides.Amidst the scare, the Locust Control Organisation on Saturday said it would take three to four days to completely control the locusts from the affected farms in Sriganganagar and Bikaner districts.TOI on Saturday visited more than 20 villages under Gharsana and Khajuwala tehsils where famers were upset with the measures taken by the authorities.“They have been spraying pesticides from tractor-mounted drums which is totally ineffective and cover a very short area. I must suggest the authorities to plan for aerial spray in the border districts and if needed should also engage the Border Security Force (BSF) in the task,” said Gurmeet Singh, a native of 23 GD village under Gharsana tehsil of Sriganganagar district.Many farmers said at some of the villages, the authorities were spraying only in the forests and were sparing crops on which locusts were found. “Since May 2019, they have been on the task of controlling the locusts, but it appears their attempt is half-hearted so far and is not yet fruitful,” said Radheyshyam Meghwal, a native of 6 BGM village in Khajuwala.Farmers also suggested the state government should engage more employees of the agriculture and revenue department to cover the affected villages.Amidst the scare, Dr KL Gurjar, deputy director of Locust Control Organsation said, “It will take three to four days to control the locusts.

VADODARA: The three accused who killed a casual labourer, whose body was burnt near Adadara village in Halol, were sent to police custody for a week by a local court on Saturday.

Warasia police produced Anil Rajput, Suresh Marwadi and Nagin Gandhi before the court on Saturday afternoon to seek their remand as they are yet to nab the fourth accused and recover the murder weapon. “We have to question them to know the whereabouts of the fourth accused and also recover the weapon which they used to kill Rishank alias Nandu. We also want to know who attacked the deceased first,” said a police official. The trio will also be taken to the crime scene for reconstruction.

The three accused were nabbed due to the alertness of an auto-rickshaw driver who had dropped them at Adadara. Growing suspicious of the blood stains he saw in the auto later, he alerted cops who cracked the case and arrested the three casual labourers before they could escape. The trio admitted of killing Rishank on suspicion of him having an affair with Rajput’s wife. Cops are yet to ascertain identity of another accomplice.

The trio had called Rishank to his house in Kishanwadi on January 16 where he was killed and in the wee hours they took his body to Halol and burned it.

Madurai: At a time when ferocious bulls are known to knock down tamers, Vellaiya alias Selvam has become a social media sensation by leaping over a woman and her child who accidentally entered its path at the Siravayal Manjuvirattu in Sivaganga district on Friday. While many held their breath, the woman and the child escaped unharmed.

So what would have prompted the animal to show such quick reflexes and ‘resourcefulness’ not to harm the duo. Sundaram, father of the bull’s owner Ramarajan, of Thirukalampur panchayat in Pudukottai, says the six-year-old bull is mostly tended to by his daughter-in-law Sathya. She always carried her eight-month-old son Thirumaran when she fed the bull. ``He is ferocious but very tame when she handles him,’’ he said.

According to Sundaram, this was the first taming game that the bull had participated in this year. Siravayal manjavirattu is as famous as Alanganallur jallikattu but is different from jallikattu because of the bigger ground where the bulls are unleashed and they run a longer distance. ``There are chances that he thought it was my daughter-in-law and child, and jumped over them,’’ added Sundaram.

A sea of women stage protest against CAA, NRC and NPR at Albert Hall in city on Saturday

JAIPUR: Jaipur continues to live its Shaheen Bagh moment at the iconic Albert Hall. The series of ongoing protests happening every day since January 5, scaled up on Saturday with over 5,000 turning up for an all-women protest in the city. The anti-CAA-NPR-NRC agitation was led by student leaders from Jamia Milia Islamia (JMI), Aligarh Muslim University and Jawaharlal Nehru University, along with local leaders.

JMI’s student Ayesha Raina, who became the face of Jamia protests for facing a baton while saving a man, stormed the audience with her fierce speech laced with poetry and slogans. She urged Jaipur’s women to stand like a rock against the ‘divisive’ and ‘draconian’ citizenship law, like the women in Shaheen Bagh.

“Dear sisters and mothers, those who say we are creating chaos on the roads, you tell them that you are scripting history by fighting for protecting the basic tenets of our Constitution. Continue this fight till we succeed,” said Raina.

The 2.5-hour protest session that started at 11am, saw poetry recitation sessions and songs played by local women and activists in between the speakers. The popular slogans — ‘Hum lekar rahenge Azadi...garibi se, manuvad se, fasiwad se (We will free India from poverty, Manu-ism and fascism), Inquilab Zindabad (long live revolution), Hum Dekhenge (we will see) — resonated in the entire Ramnivas Garden area which houses Albert Hall.

AMU’s Wardha Beg clad in a burkha asked the protesting women to never hesitate in raising their voices against injustice. “I am proud of the fact that Muslim women are at the fore safeguarding the very ethos of our country. Our PM, Modi has said that protesters can be identified by their clothes, which should be taken as a badge of honour,” said Beg.

The protesters — comprising toddlers, students, housewives and grannies — made their way from the narrow alleys of the Walled City, braving the cold, with temperature being close to 18 degree Celsius. Most of these women were in hijab or burkha holding banners and the national flag, while actively reciprocating to the call of slogans and applauded the speeches. All India Muslim Personal Law board member Yasmeen Farooqui, who was one of the main speakers, was spellbound to see the huge attendance of women.

“This is the biggest gathering ever since the protest started here. Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh protest has given a lot of confidence to the protesting women who come from orthodox families. I should thank PM Narendra Modi for waking up the country’s most socially, politically and economically disadvantaged groups,” said Farooqui.

The protests here have been going on since January 5, everyday from 5pm to 7pm. The organizers, taking a queue from Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, organised an all-women’s protest in the city.

More than 99.9 per cent of all species that ever lived on earth, amounting to over five billion species, are estimated to be extinct. Estimates on the number of eart’'s current species range from 10 million to 14 million of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 per cent have not yet been described.

She said deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and forests and environment minister Sukhram Vishnoi had approved the scholarship programme for conducting research in biodiversity so that eligible students get a proper platform.

Sinha said DST would soon invite online applications from students on the department’s website. She said the time to conduct research on biodiversity would be six months.

After the students apply online, the biodiversity board and DST will select eligible candidates. The students will have to conduct the research as per the UGC guidelines, she added.

Locusts lying at a field in Khajuwala, Bikaner on Saturday

JAIPUR: The prolonged attack by locusts in bordering districts has seen over 6,500 anti-locust operations in the last few months. The operations have left crores of these dead pests scattered in 3.45 lakh hectares including some portions of cropped areas causing concern.

“The locust contains high organic matter, which enriches the quality of the soil but a high presence of pesticides in their body, might have reverse effects on the soil,” said Om Prakash, commissioner, agriculture, Rajasthan . The department will collect soil samples to carry out a detailed and comprehensive study of the impact of the locust corpse in the soil.

This year, the attack by locust has been continuing since May 23 making it longest attack in India in the records of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The prolonged attack has forced the Locust Warning Organization (LWO), a body under the agriculture ministry for monitoring and holding counter locust operations to carry out operations on average every 45 minutes from May 23 til January 7.

“Two types of chemicals are used to prevent the movement of locust based on the non-cropped and cropped area. In the former category the chemical used is high on its values as it would cause no major risk to the soil which is non-productive. The chemical used in the second category has light values to ensure it should not affect the soil. But the consistent attack has crossed all limits of using the chemical which can have any impact on the soil once the locust decomposes,” said KL Gurjar, director of LWO.

Experts are fearing that the consistent use of chemicals and several times more number of locust corpse mixed in the soil is likely to can impact the qualities of the soil. ""The limited attack by locust has always positive impact on the soil. This time situation is different and one cannot preempt unless supported by the scientific study,"" said Prakash. The lasting impact of the decomposition of locust will not become evident in the rabi season but will have it in Kharif season. The agriculture department has also directed the agriculture universities in the state to study its impact on the soil.

There was dense fog in the city for at least four hours between 5.30am and 9.30am on Saturday

NEW DELHI: Over 50 flights got delayed and 20 trains were running late as dense-to-very dense fog hit the capital in the early hours of Saturday. The visibility fell to 50 metres at Palam at 5.30am while it remained below 200 metres at Safdarjung till 9.30am. The minimum temperature also dropped by 3 degrees Celsius on Saturday from Friday’s low.

Both maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to fall further in the next 24 hours with dense fog expected to continue on Sunday, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. A spell of light rain is also predicted on Tuesday, owing to a fresh western disturbance.

On Friday, the minimum temperature was 11.3 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal for the season. On Saturday, it fell to 8.4, 1 degree above normal, and is likely to be 7 degrees by Sunday. “Delhi is likely to record a maximum and minimum of 17 and 7 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Sunday,” said a Met official. On Saturday, the maximum was 17.7 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees below normal for the season.

The Met department had forecast Delhi to receive dense fog on Saturday morning before visibility improving around the afternoon. IMD scientist Kuldeep Srivastava said dense fog was recorded for at least four hours between 5.30am and 9.30am.

While an IGI Airport official said there was no cancellation or diversion due to fog, Northern Railway stated at least 20 trains were running late by over 1 hour.

Delhi had recorded 16.8mm rain on Thursday, with the relative humidity remaining high on Friday — between 76% and 100%. “After the previous western disturbance passed, Delhi had high moisture content. As clear skies recorded on Friday along with the sunny condition, it led to radiation cooling which tends to generate dense fog,” said Srivastava.

According to IMD, a fresh western disturbance is likely to impact the region by Monday. “Temperatures will once again rise during this period,” said Srivastava.

More than 1 lakh people visited Marina on ‘Kaanum Pongal’, while 5,000 people visited Elliot’s beach

CHENNAI: Corporation workers removed 25.8 tonnes of garbage in two of the most popular beaches in the city — Marina and Elliot’s — a day after ‘Kaanum Pongal’. The number, officials said was at least five tonnes more than the amount generated last year. However, compared to 2018, when 42 tonnes of garbage was collected after the Pongal holidays, the numbers have come down.

According to an official release by the civic body, around 15.8 tonnes of garbage was collected from the Marina, three times the daily average of about five tonnes. At Elliot’s beach, 10 tonnes of garbage was collected, while the daily average is around three tonnes. As per police estimates, more than 1 lakh people visited Marina on Kaanum Pongal, while 5,000 people visited Elliot’s beach.

According to the corporation release, more than 120 conservancy workers, apart from a compactor and six beach-cleaning vehicles were deployed to sweep up the litter at Marina.

This year, the civic body had announced Elliot’s beach as a litter-free zone and had said it will work towards sensitising the visiting public as well. Civic body officials said this was the first step in their long-term aim to make the beach completely litter free.

“We have set up set up colour-coded bins to collect different types of dry waste along the shore and on the beach road. It will be sent to ‘material recovery facilities’, a recycling centre. For starters, traders and vendors on Elliot’s beach have been counselled to maintain the beach litter free,” said a corporation official, adding that once discipline kicks in among the traders and regular visitors, enforcement would become easier.

The corporation has also hired a contractor. As part of this, 18 conservancy workers will work in two shifts, 24 X 7, to collect the litter on the beach. An information board appealing to visitors to not throw plastics into the sea along with statistics on plastics dumped in the sea and how it affects the marine ecosystem has been put up.

Nita Kanwar and her husband flash victory sign at their house on Saturday

JAIPUR: Pakistan-born Nita Kanwar (36), who contested panchayat elections from Natwara gram panchayat in Tonk district , got elected to the post of sarpanch by defeating his nearest rival Sonu Devi by 362 votes. Kanwar got 1,035 votes, while Devi polled 673.

Calling herself the daughter-in-law of India, Nita says, “She supports granting citizenship to all who migrate to India out of compulsion.”

Kanwar, who migrated to Jodhpur from Sindh in Pakistan in 2001, was granted Indian citizenship in September 2019. “I am feeling very good. I am the daughter-in-law of this village. It is a matter of pride that I am getting support from my in-laws, family and the people of the village. I never imagined that I would become a sarpanch or join politics, but as a child I always wanted to work for the poor,” Nita told TOI.

Asked if she supported the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Kanwar said, “I wouldn't like to say much about it, but I would always support citizenship being granted to every women like me, who has to migrate to India from Sindh, pre-dominated by Rajput Sodhas, as they cannot marry another Sodha as per the tradition.""

""We should understand that we are all human beings. Those who have to come here (to India) out of compulsion (should get citizenship). It (granting citizenship) is a positive thing for every women like me. I would support granting citizenship (despite amendment in the Citizenship Act),"" she added, when informed that she was granted citizenship at a time when the Act was not amended.

""Even though I am from Pakistan, it has never been my intention to rule or become a leader. I am the daughter-in-law of India and want to serve the people of the village,"" she further said.

She said that her file to apply for Indian citizenship was rejected four times and was granted citizenship in the fifth attempt. ""My case was the first one in Tonk. I had to run from pillar to post in Tonk and also had to travel to Jaipur several times.""

""I want to work towards women empowerment, providing good education, proper medical facilities for women by setting up a hospital so that they don't have to travel outside the village for treatment. I also want to help women get employment, widows get pension and the farmers get all the facilities for farming here in the village,"" Nita added.

Tata Motors (file photo)

PUNE: Tata Motors’ decision to introduce the electric version of Nexon SUV was based on several calculations, including the cost factor, Shailesh Chandra, president, electric mobility business and corporate strategy, Tata Motors , said on Friday.

Chandra explained that the price range of the electric version was closer to the existing internal combustion engine (ICE) model of the same vehicle. He said the current positive mood on SUVs and the less price sensitive nature of the buyer base in the segment were also behind the decision of launching Nexon electric vehicle (EV).

“When you talk about a segment above Rs 10 lakh, the consumers are not very price sensitive. They look for technology and new features. So, I said this is the segment, where we have more opportunity,” Chandra said.

The company also has two versions of Tigor electric car — the 213km range car aimed at the fleet segment (where maximum electric cars are sold) and the 140km range car aimed for the government offices, whose tender the company won about two years ago.

Chandra said the company does not have a production number in mind for the Nexon EV but it can ramp it up very quickly, given that it is already doing the ICE version of the Nexon at its factories.

Tata Motors is also hoping that it will have an edge over its competitors due to the price range of the Nexon EV.

“The price of EVs available in the market now is 2-2.5 times of the comparable ICE cars… Research showed us that if the EV price is within 25% premium of the ICE car, there is a higher chance of customers buying it. We have tried to optimise and strike the balance between price, range, performance and aspirational features,” Chandra said.

He said that logically a “sustainable” EV version on an entry level car (equivalent of the Tiago) is still some 2-3 years away till the price of the batteries come down.

At the medical relief society meeting held here on Saturday, the collector discussed key issues related to the hospital and said proposals should be invited for implementing a proper queue management system for benefit of patients.

He said the average footfall of patients in the hospital is around 3,000 and all patients waiting in the outpatient department should know about their turn to see the doctor.

For the purpose, he directed the hospital authorities to study the queue management system in banks and also in Sawai Man Singh Hospital, where it has already been implemented. Jaipuria Hospital has been directed to invite firms for implementing the system for patients.

The collector approved proposal of roping in civil defence workers for round-the-clock availability as part of fire safety measures.

Vadodara: The two owners of Aims Industries Pvt Ltd at Padra where a blast in the bottling plant claimed six lives were granted anticipatory bail by a sessions court on Saturday.

Siddharth Patel and his son and director Swetanshu Patel had sought anticipatory bail on January 13 on the grounds that they have already paid compensation to the family of the deceased and are also taking care of the medical expenses of four injured persons.

The duo also argued that their company has proper licenses for bottling and other operations. “The applicants are directors of the company and they have employed staff to look after the operations so they cannot be directly held responsible for the deaths,” their advocate Nehal Dave argued.

The police, however, argued before the court that the owners did not possess explosives license for filling and refilling of hydrogen gas.

Other gases were also found from the site for which they do not have licences, cops claimed.

Police also informed the court that the duo did not learn any lesson from a fire which had broken out at the same facility in 2015-16. No safety equipment were given to the workers.

The court upheld the arguments of the accused duo and granted them bail on a personal bond of Rs 15,000 each.

They have also been asked to get the compensation cheques of Rs 21 lakh each cleared and also submit an affidavit of it along with the bank statement in the court.

Meanwhile, on Saturday the three arrested accused – director Satyakumar Nair, plant manager Akash Agrawal and operator-cum-supervisor Raju Rathwa – were taken to the bottling plant for reconstruction.

Jaipur Development Authority office

JAIPUR: The Jaipur Development Authority ( JDA ) has decided to earn revenue after transferring its land to Rajasthan State Industrial Development & Investment Corporation Ltd (RIICO). The civic body is expecting to earn Rs 122 crore by selling its land to industries after it transferred approximately 62 hectares of land in Bagru.

According to official, the decision was taken after the proposal received a nod from the Urban Development and Housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal .

The JDA will also prepare the list of properties which has been put under the hammer several times but could not find buyers.

As the real estate sector is going through a slump and the JDA is battling to meet its targets, zone commissioners of the civic body have been asked to earn revenue if they wanted better grades in the annual confidential report (ACR).

A JDA official said, “Zone commissioners will identify the reasons why these properties did not sell. Bigger plots, which are out of reach of buyers, will be reduced in size. To earn revenue, the zones will also focus on collection of lease money.”

The civic body will also run a special auction campaign to sell its property. The JDA will also introduce lotteries to sell its unsold plots in existing housing schemes.

As JDA has many schemes in far-flung areas, not many residents have applied to buy those in the past as the authority failed to provide even basic facilities.

Due to lack of power and water, the sites of these colonies continue to wear a deserted look. An official source said since 2005, the civic body has launched 31 housing schemes, but most of those are still unoccupied.

After the BJP government came to power, the JDA launched many housing schemes after a gap of four years. The cash-strapped body earned a revenue of Rs 700 crore from those schemes. However, this money was not spent on developing these colonies.

192,['19/01/2020'],"Bengaluru: Cut in Metro smartcard subsidy will increase road traffic, say Experts","BMRCL set to slash fare discount for smartcard users from 15% to 5% from Monday

BENGALURU: With Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited ( BMRCL ) set to slash fare discount for smartcard users from 15% to 5% from Monday, experts and passengers have urged Metro authorities to focus on non-fare box (non-ticketing) revenue instead of burdening commuters.Experts say any increase in fares may shift passengers to private vehicles, which will further choke the already-clogged city. Across the globe, public transport is highly subsidised. Utilities focus on non-fare box revenue such as advertisements, auctioning of naming rights, branding of stations, leasing of space and property development to stem losses.Sources say more than 25 acres of vacant land is available with BMRCL along Phase 1 corridor. On the Purple Line, the corporation has 15 acres around Byappanahalli Metro depot, two acres on Swami Vivekananda Road, five acres on Mysuru Road and one acre in Vijayanagar. Similarly, it has two acres in Yelachenahalli and one acre in Peenya. However, most of these plots are used for parking.Further, spaces inside Metro stations aren’t being used properly, with only a few stations having ATMs and small outlets. “Cut in discount on a service that may be already considered on the higher side of affordable transport will further affect passengers,” said Sudeept Maiti of World Resources Institute, which works on transport issues.Urban mobility expert Pawan Mulukutla added: “Reduction in discounts will send the wrong message. This is like penalising people for using public transport. But there are no restrictions like congestion pricing and premium parking fees to discourage private vehicles.”Experts say non-fare box revenue can compensate loss-making operations and boost profitability. In cities like Hong Kong and Tokyo, commercial/property development at Metro stations are used to maximise revenue. For instance, non-fare box revenue in Hong Kong Metro is around 42% and it is 25% in Delhi Metro.When contacted, a senior BMRCL official said, “Ticket fare continues to be a major source of earnings.

CHENNAI: Nearly five lakh passengers travelled on metro trains during the 5-day Pongal holidays , including more than 1.25 lakh on ‘ Kaanum Pongal ’.

Earlier this week, city roads began emptying of traffic ahead of the festival, but the number of passengers using metro trains was steady at 1.21 lakh on Monday and 1.25 lakh on Tuesday. On Pongal day, when arterial roads were deserted, traveller count on the metro too dipped, with 72,845 people using the service on January 15 and 95,379 commuting on January 16.

On January 17, around 1,25,333 passengers used the metro rail service to travel . CMRL operated feeder services from Government Estate and AG-DMS metro stations to the popular Marina beach on Friday. In a bid to improve footfalls, CMRL also announced 50% discount on tickets for people using the service between January 15 and January 17. In October 2019, it had announced discount for people using metro trains on Sundays and government holidays, across the 45km network.

While CMRL’s estimated average daily footfalls is 7.76 lakh across the network, its daily average ridership is now only 1.16 lakh.

It was also decided to separate Devnarayan Chatraa Scooty Scheme from Kalibai Bheel Medhavi Chatraa Scooty Yojana.

The decision was taken during government's meeting with the members of Gurjar Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti including Kirori Singh Bainsla. Now, all the scooty distribution schemes run by TAD department, higher education, school education, minority affairs, social justice and empowerment departments for meritorious girls of all categories would be clubbed into one namely, Kalibai Bheel Medhavi Chatraa Scooty Yojana.

195,['19/01/2020'],City civic body budget may shy away from tax hikes,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Vadodara: The ensuing Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) budget may not burden citizens with major hikes in taxes or charges collected by the civic body. VMC may shy away from doing so in wake of the ensuing civic polls and the rows over water supply and other services in the current financial year.

The VMC administration is expected to present the draft budget for the financial year 2020-2021 next week. While the cash-strapped civic body is looking to increase its revenue, it may have to look for options other than raising taxes and charges.

Sources said that while the civic body is looking to increase the size of the budget by around 10% compared to last year. The 2019-20 budget was of Rs 3,554 crore when cleared by the elected wing of the civic body.

According to sources, even if the administration suggests hikes in taxes and charges it is unlikely that the elected wing will clear these. In an election year, the political bosses in the VMC may not want to antagonise the electorate.

The civic body may also shy away from hikes as it is already facing protests regarding the supply of insufficient, turbid and contaminated water in different parts of the city. The opposition in the VMC is also demanding that it should not collect taxes or, at least, water charges from areas where the problem was acute.

The budget may also have to be realistic and not promise big ticket projects that cannot be taken up in the future. The new civic works will largely be those that are taken up from grants from the state government like the flyovers proposed in the city as well as those from other schemes.

JODHPUR: Rajasthan High Court has issued notices to the Union government while accepting a petition challenging the validity of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Ordinance 2019.

Petitioner Sanjay Mehta has challenged the amendment which states that no petition filed by any home buyer or real estate allottee would be entertained by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) unless it was filed jointly by not less than 100 of such creditors in the same class or not less than 10% of the total number of such creditors in the same class, whichever is less.

Petitioner’s counsel Mohit Singhvi said, “We have challenged this amendment in section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016, which was absolutely unjustifiable”.

He argued the impugned ordinance is nothing but a glaring example of the colourable exercise of power creating a subclass within a class and is therefore liable to be struck down being ultra vires to the Constitution of India, 1950.

Accepting the plea raised by the counsel, the court issued notices to the ministry of law and justice and ministry of corporate affairs, Union of India, and has sought explanation from them.

An aspirant uses the newly-installed iron chair at Gandhi Nagar Park in Secunderabad on Saturday

SECUNDERABAD: For the convenience of students appearing for various competitive examinations, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has decided to convert many parks in Secunderabad into ‘study zones’. On Saturday, the officials of GHMC ’s urban biodiversity wing, North Zone, installed iron chairs at Gandhi Nagar Park in the city on a pilot basis, where students appearing for the exams can sit and study.

Many aspirants attending coaching classes to prepare for competitive exams in this part of the city have often been spotted visiting GHMC parks to study after their classes. Some of them even carry their own chairs and writing pads. After they finish studying, usually they fix these chairs to trees in the parks using chains to avoid theft. So, GHMC officials who have seen this happening in about 10 parks at Chikkadpally decided to create these ‘study zones’. They will set up similar iron chairs permanently in other parks too.

“Though people associate parks with recreation, many students use them to study because of the peaceful environs. As the number of aspirants is huge for such exams, often many of them cannot study inside a single room due to lack of space,” said P Anand, an aspirant, preparing for the Staff Selection Commission exam. He usually visits Gandhi Nagar Park for studying. “I see about 10 to 20 aspirants visiting this park regularly to study,” he added.

“We were impressed by a concept in Pune, where the civic body had made similar arrangements in parks for the convenience of students. We decided to implement something similar at select parks in Secunderabad where students visit to study,” said Maqsood Ali, deputy director of urban biodiversity wing, North Zone. A group of senior GHMC officials along with city mayor Bonthu Rammohan visited Pune last month to study the concept.

“Before launching this initiative, a sample survey was conducted, and we identified Gandhi Nagar Park for the pilot project,” said Maqsood Ali. The seats, each costing about Rs 7,000, were arranged based on the space available in the park.

Organic farmers’ market in Udaipur on Saturday

UDAIPUR: From exotics like red capsicum and broccoli, to all kinds of leafy vegetables and pure honey, the stock of the farmers gets sold out within a few hours. No leftovers and no farmer slashing the rates of his veggies just to sell off his stock.

This is the ‘Organic Farmers’ Market’, a farm-to-fork concept initiated by Jaisa Organics, a local organic farm, in association with an NGO Shikshantar and other partners, aiming to eliminate middlemen and enable farmers to sell their produce without having to shell out commissions. The farmers make sure their rates match the market price.

“We know that there is a high demand for organically grown vegetables in urban areas. We thought of creating a platform to facilitate the residents to meet their local farmers every Saturday. Rooted in the philosophy of eat local, buy local, support local, the customers can find locally grown fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy products etc. directly from the farmers,” Manish Jain, co founder of Shikshantar told TOI. The initiative believes in reducing food kilometres and the carbon-footprints of food items by sourcing the products from within 100 kilometres of the city, along with targets of generating zero waste. Farmers’ market is a win-win situation for both the customers, who get fresh and nutritious produce at one place and for the small local farmers, who can sell their produce directly to the consumer. Several local familiar names like Millets of Mewar, Banyan Roots, Jovaki, Ecohut, Zero Waste Udaipur , Pranav Ayurdedic and small scale food processors from the district, brought forest honey, freshly extracted juices, smoothies, nutritious paranthas etc. “Each week will feature a special activity where visitors can learn about innovations in rooftop farming techniques to hands-on pottery experiences. The market will be held every Saturday in the old Ashoka cinema parking area from 10am to 2pm,” Manish said.

Garbage strewn around at a monument

CHENNAI: With tourists making a beeline for the Unesco-notified Pallava-era monuments in Mamallapuram on ‘ Kaanum Pongal ’, the place recorded a jump in garbage generation. Officials from Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) said they collected 500kg of garbage, a lot more than the volume collected regularly on the premises.

“We strictly disallow eatables and plastic items inside the monuments, but people continue to bring the items. However, the volume of garbage was more only on Friday and not on the days preceding it,” said an ASI official. “All garbage was cleared by evening.”

Meanwhile, officials from the town panchayat said they collected one tonne extra garbage. It’s around seven to eight tonnes in the entire area. Tamil Nadu tourism department sources said one lakh people visited Mamallapuram on Friday and more than 19,000 lined up to see Arjuna’s Penance, Five Rathas and Krishna’s butterball and Shore Temple. It was the highest in the last three days. On Pongal and Mattu Pongal, the ticketed monuments recorded footfalls of 12,500 and 18,000, respectively. The footfalls were higher than the average 13,500 on weekends.

200,['19/01/2020'],Nagpur: Op of power plants in violation of promises in Supreme Court,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: After missing the pollution control deadline for the second time, the deadly coal-fired plants across the country continue to operate “in violation of the Centre’s promises made in the Supreme Court”, say experts.

In a notification issued by the Union environment ministry in December 2015, all coal-fired power plants were first directed to install pollution-control technologies by December 2017. The plants failed to do so.

The deadline was then extended to December 2019 after the ministry of power and central electricity authority (CEA) submitted a new phasing plan in the Supreme Court in 2018. Power plants with a total capacity of 16.41 (GW) were to retrofit flu-gas desulphurization (FGD), a technology to control toxic sulphur dioxide emissions.

The ministry submission came during a hearing related to extension of deadline for implementing emission standards as part of the MC Mehta case.

However, the designated power plants situated in Delhi-NCR, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu have once again failed in adhering to the extended deadline submitted in the apex court.

During conversations with TOI, CPCB top officials stated that the board was yet to decide the next course of action. “The power plants are at different stages of installing FGDs. Some have initiated the bidding process, some haven’t while some have already awarded the bid. Hence, we are deliberating on the kind of actions that should be taken against different plants,” an official said.

Since the first week of January, TOI has been enquiring with the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MOEFCC) and CPCB about the progress made on FGDs. But, every time, the officials gave a statement that the decision was yet to be taken.

Meanwhile, the offending plants continue to run. On December 31, at 11.55pm, the Nabha Power Limited plant in Rajpura, Punjab, had shut down its operations citing “pollution problems”. However, it soon started its operations.

Objecting against the operation of plants post the deadline, environment and legal experts demanded that they should be shut down. Sunil Dahiya, analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said that the environment ministry and CPCB must penalize the polluters too.

“This will set a strong precedent for other power plants. This is the second instance that these plants have missed the deadline to install pollution control devices,” said Dahiya.

Dahiya added that their functioning and emissions of SO2 beyond permissible levels is a clear violation of law as well as phasing timeline submitted by CEA and power ministry in the Supreme Court.

Noted environment lawyer Ritwick Dutta highlighted how not even a single power plant in the country had complied with the earlier deadline of December 2017. “The timeline was extended but in vain. As per CPCB’s own directions, plants which do not comply will have to shut down, in addition to the penal action against them. Even the outer deadline of 2022 for compliance is unlikely to be met given the slow pace at which the compliance is taking place,” he said, adding that this will be in complete violation of the undertaking given by the power companies to the court.

The state pollution control boards should prosecute the directors of all the companies who are operating their power plants without installing the FGDs and other requisite pollution control equipment, stated environment expert Debi Goenka. “These plants should be shut down until they comply with the regulations and meet the standards. Given the low PLFs, shutting down non-compliant units would not create too much of a crisis, but would certainly help save thousands of lives,” said Goenka.

Rudrapur: LD Bhatt Civil Hospital in Kashipur of Udham Singh Nagar district, has been grappling with the shortage of pediatricians for some years now. Currently, the hospital, where 200 babies are born every month on an average, does not have a single child specialist.

On an average, over 500 patients visit the hospital’s Out Patient Department (OPD) every day. Hospital authorities said that filling in for a pediatrician , in addition to looking after OPD, emergency and admitted patients, becomes a daunting task.

According to data available with the hospital, 2,085 children were born in the facility from April to December 2019. Only one pediatrician was available in the hospital that year. Dr Pawan Sinha, chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the hospital, said that even though the institute had modern amenities, shortage of doctors led to all their staff being overburdened and patients not receiving proper treatment. “Four nurses are posted in our child care ward but the pediatrician there has been on leave for 45 days. We are trying to get another doctor posted there soon,” Sinha said.

“Often after working from 9am to 3pm in the OPD, we get called to the emergency ward. We are always on call and all of our staff members are overworked and overburdened. Even the lower staff members are overburdened with work. The administration has been aware of the situation for a long time, but no steps are being taken to fill the vacancies,” said a staff member at the hospital, requesting anonymity.

Noor Ahmed, father of a patient at the hospital said, ""In the last few years, some pediatricians moved to other centres, while others opted for premature retirement. However, the government hasn’t taken any steps to fill the vacant posts.”

Some patients also alleged that due to the absence of child specialists in the hospitals, the number of middlemen whisking patients away to private hospitals for expensive treatment had increased. “They (middlemen) take parents looking to consult child specialists to private hospitals, where treatment is expensive. This enables the middleman to pocket some commission,” said Ramesh Kapoor, a local resident.

Chandrashekhar Azad

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Saturday asked police to verify whether Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad had an office in Delhi for holding political meetings .

The direction came on the plea of Azad, who was accused of inciting people during an anti-CAA protest at Jama Masjid on December 20, seeking modifications in his bail order. Earlier this week, the court had restrained Azad from visiting Delhi for four weeks and directed him to not hold any dharna till the elections in the national capital, while granting him bail in a case related to violent protests at Daryaganj.

Hearing his latest plea, additional sessions judge Kamini Lau directed police to verify from the Election Commission if Azad’s office in Delhi was an office of a political party and asked them to submit a report by January 21, when the matter would be taken up next.

The plea, filed through advocates Mehmood Pracha and O P Bharti, sought modification of the earlier order, arguing that the restrictions on Azad amounted to violation of his fundamental rights to take active participation in awareness camps and to advise and lead the poor, weak and downtrodden sections of the society and minorities.

His counsels submitted that the Bhim Army chief was a “leader of the oppressed and depressed sections of society”, including minorities and worked for their social and political awareness, adding that he held weekly meetings of the society ‘Bhim Army Ekta Mission’, of which he was the founder, at his local address in Delhi, so his presence in the capital was justified.

It further said Azad used to travel throughout the country for the cause and due to the restrictions it would be next to impossible for him to personally appear and report his presence before the station house officer of Fatehpur police station in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, every Saturday.

The plea said he was even unable to visit his own house for months together due to his campaigns, arguing that since he was under treatment at AIIMS, in case of emergency it would not be appropriate for him to seek permission of the DCP of Crime Branch, Delhi, every time and would pose a risk to his life in case of medical emergency

The court, while granting him bail, had allowed that before going to Saharanpur if Azad wanted to go anywhere, including Jama Masjid, during the 24 hours after release, police would escort him. Special circumstances call for special conditions, the judge had said, further directing him to meet the SHO of Fatehpur police station every Saturday for next four weeks and thereafter on the last Saturday of every month.

Confirming the decision taken in the meeting held five days back, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) rejec... Read More

NAGPUR: It’s now official: Hundreds of age-old trees in Bharat Van will not be cut. Confirming the decision taken in the meeting held five days back, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) rejected MahaMetro’s application seeking felling and transplantation of around 558 trees in Bharat Van.

In a latest letter written to MahaMetro’s project director Mahesh Kumar, NMC’s garden superintendent Amol Chorpagar dismissed the need for cutting or relocating trees. On February 1 last year, the Metro had sought permission to transplant more than 500 trees that were in the way of a road through Bharat Van.

Following this, the civic body had issued a public notice in a Hindi daily, informing citizens that 101 big and medium-sized trees, and 457 small trees were in the way of the proposed road. NMC had also sought citizens’ objections but the mandatory public hearing was not held.

In its latest letter, Chorpagar cited a letter written by MahaMetro on September 13 last year, which stated that after the plan for Futala’s viewing gallery and tunnel road was revised, there is no need to construct the 18-metre road from Amravati Road to Telangkhedi Hanuman Mandir via Bharat Nagar .

“As the road is not needed, NMC rejects the agency’s permission to cut trees,” the superintendent stated.

The letter added that if the need for the said road arises in future, fresh application seeking permission will have to be submitted to NMC.

Greens heaved a sigh of relief with the affirmation of Bharat Van being safe coming on paper. However, they have demanded deletion of the road from the city’s development plan (DP).

“Bharat Van is one of the last few green pockets remaining in the city and in the coming days, the need to conserve it is only going to increase. Hence to ensure permanent protection, it should be removed from the DP,” said Jaydeep Das, honorary wildlife warden of Nagpur.

Based on TOI’s reports, Das had written a letter to the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court highlighting the adverse impacts of the proposed road. HC had treated his letter as a suo motu public interest litigation on December 3, 2018. “To save the precious time of public as well as the judiciary, NMC and other related agencies should immediately inform the court about the final decision,” he said.

The case is scheduled to come up for hearing against later this month.

205,['19/01/2020'],Nagpur: Collared tigress found dead in Gadchiroli,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR/CHANDRAPUR: A collared tigress (E-4), whose GPS tracking signal broke down four months ago, was found dead in Gadchiroli forest on Saturday morning during a routine patrol.

Last sighted in December during a ground-tracking exercise, the three-year-old tigress’s carcass was discovered in a decomposed condition in the dense forest falling under the Chatgaon range. Post mortem has ruled out foul play in the tigress’s death, which was collared last year at Brahmapuri.

Chief conservator of forest (CCF), Chandrapur, SV Ramarao said “The carcass seems to be at least two weeks old but we can say that it was a natural death. The skin was intact and no other body part was missing. The carcass was found deep in the forest early in morning and we immediately moved our team members to the spot.”

He added that after collaring at Brahmapuri, the tigress moved on to Wadsa range before finally making Gadchiroli district its home.

The loss of GPS signal from E-4’s collar is also baffling forest officials. Ramarao said, “It’s the first time such a thing has happened. I can’t say what is the technical reason behind it as that will have to be ascertained by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII).”

Once the GPS signal was reported lost, forest officials started tracking E-4 in a traditional manner. “We have a ground-tracking system and that’s what we relied on to track her. We were monitoring the tigress and she was last sighted in December,” said Ramarao.

While officials have ruled out any foul play, an enquiry will ensue as per protocol. “An ACF will be nominated to head the enquiry and find out the actual cause of death,” said Ramarao.

After the tigress’s carcass was discovered, a team comprising deputy conservator (DCF) of forests Kulraj Singh, wildlife warden and NTCA representative Vivek Karambdekar and biologist Rakesh Ahuja rushed to the spot. Singh identified the tigress on the basis of the collar and its stripes pattern.

A team of veterinary doctors from Chandrapur carried out the post mortem, but failed to find the cause of death as the body was in a putrefied state. They took samples of dried viscera of the tigress which will now be sent to forensic lab for confirmation of cause of death.

Deputy conservator of forest officer (Gadchiroli forest division) Kumar Swami too ruled out the possibility of poaching and claimed that all the nails and canines of the tigress were recovered from the spot.

Nagpur: Two days after the series of protests at Samvidhan Chowk ended, a bigger rally, backed by outfits like Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Hind and Jamiate-e-Islami-e-Hind, was taken out till the venue on Friday.

Even as over 5,000 people assembled at the venue, sources in the police department said that onlookers, nearly four times the number, were present when the rally passed through areas like Mominpura, starting from Teka Naka in North Nagpur.

Former Congress minister Anees Ahmed was also seen on the dais as leaders from Muslim as well as Buddhist organizations addressed the gathering at Samvidhan Chowk. The rally began after Friday prayers in mosques.

“If you want to corner the government, plug its sources of revenues. The government depends on the tax it earns from businessmen. Stop buying from Sindhi and Marwari traders. Buy things that your need from shops of our own people. If these businessmen don’t earn, the government will not get taxes,” said Banthe Gyanbodhi, a Buddhist monk.

“Stop addressing the country as Hindustan. This means a Hindurashtra (a Hindu nation). Call it Bharat,” he said as speeches with emphasis on pluralism continued.

Another speaker, Hafiz Basit, said it was a not protest by Muslims alone. “There’s been support from other sects’ bodies too. The secular character of the constitution means that there will be no discrimination on the basis of ethnicity. However, some right wing organizations have been only trying to spread poison. It’s only because of unity in diversity that they say ‘Sare Jahan se Accha Hindustan Hamara’,” he said.

“They say Muslims don’t utter certain lines. If that is so, here is it,” said a speaker, who sung the initial lines of Vande Matram.

207,['19/01/2020'],"Amit Shah attacks Congress, brands opponents of CAA ‘anti-Dalit’","This story is from January 19, 2020

HUBBALLI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday dubbed those opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act “anti-Dalit” and sought to assuage the fears of Muslims, saying CAA was all about including people, not excluding anyone or any community.

Addressing a public meeting here in this Karnataka town as part of BJP’s nationwide Jan Jagran Abhiyan, Shah said since 70% of refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan in India were from Dalit communities, those opposing it were anti-Dalit. “I want to ask anti-CAA protesters: What benefit will you derive from protesting against these poor Dalits?”

He said Muslims of India had nothing to worry about as the Act clearly said it wouldn’t grant citizenship to Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Taking potshots at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi several times, he said: “I challenge Rahul Gandhi to prove CAA will take away citizenship of Muslims... please read the Act completely and if you find anything that takes away citizenship of Indian Muslims, Pralhad Joshi (Union parliamentary affairs minister) is ready to debate with you.”

Justifying CAA implementation, he said the population of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains in countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh had dwindled to a meagre 3%. “Can Rahul baba explain what happened to these people in Pakistan and Bangladesh,” Shah asked, adding that he should be thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for fulfilling his grandfather’s dream.

“Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, Acharya Kriplani and Maulana Azad had originally mooted the idea of CAA. Now, Modi has actually turned their dream into reality,’’ he said, adding that even Mahatma Gandhi had wished according citizenship to minorities of neighbouring countries.

Shah slammed Congress and other opposition parties, saying they were always against national issues like CAA, abrogation of Article 370 , construction of Ram Mandir... They were all speaking the language of Pakistan and like Pakistani PM Imran Khan , were asking for proof of the surgical strike carried out by the Indian Air Force in Balakot.

Defending police action against anti-CAA protesters, Shah said it was important to punish people who allegedly raised “anti-national slogans”. “A few years ago, anti-Indian slogans were chanted at JNU. Should we not punish these anti-Indian people,” he asked.

Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who attended the meeting, told the gathering: “We’ll work together under the leadership of Modi and Shah to strengthen the party at the booth level. We’ll give priority to irrigation in the interest of farmers. As we’re working for the people, we’ll definitely get support in the next election.”

208,['19/01/2020'],Maharashtra: Sables donate funds meant for last rites,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: Lasangaon, a nondescript village in Chandur Bazaar (Amravati district), has come under the spotlight because of an inspiring humanitarian gesture by a big family of farmers.

Breaking the age-old tradition, the Sable family has set a new trend by donating the money meant for performing the last rites of their elders for noble causes.

In the first instance, the family donated books worth Rs40,000 to needy children of farmers and farm labourers, who were preparing for competitive exams conducted by the Union Public service Commission (UPSC) and Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC).

The money was meant for the first death anniversary rituals of their father Madhukarrao Sable. After being appreciated for this noble gesture by the villagers, the family decided to continue with their good work. Next year, which will be the second death anniversary of Sable senior, the family has vowed to donate more — books valued at Rs50,000 to the poor and needy government job aspirants.

“It was a collective decision by all the family members. The women of the house, too, supported us wholeheartedly. We’re five sons. Our father Madhukarrao was a progressive farmer. We noticed that students of our village, particularly children of poor farmers and farm labourers, were unable to buy expensive books due to paucity of funds,” said Prafulla Sable, who’s working as the director of the Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) in Nagpur University’s examination section.

After their father’s death in 2018, the family lost their uncle Sudhakar Sable on November 16 last year after a prolonged illness. The family, led by brothers Dilip, Sanjay, Jagan, Pappu and Prafulla decided to continue with their good work as their uncle himself told them not to waste money on performing his last rites and instead, donate the sum to poor patients who were on the other beds in the same hospital where he was admitted before his death.

“We (all the brothers) have decided to respect the last wishes of our uncle, who was also a progressive farmer and collected Rs25,000. We then donated that amount through cheques to the five patients, who were admitted to Dr Avinash Chaudhary’s Hospital.

Sheikh Hanif, Nayana Vidhale, Sarita Bande, Pravin Korpe and Pankaj Narsingkar were elated after receiving financial aid from the Sables . They were ailing and their families were unable to support them due to financial constraints. “When our uncle was admitted, these people (the other patients) had become his friends,” Sable told TOI, adding that the patients were saddened by their uncle’s death.

209,['19/01/2020'],Delhi: Hundreds march in memory of Mahatma Gandhi’s fast,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Those who gathered at the site on Saturday said they were not willing to stop at any cost

NEW DELHI: In memory of Mahatma Gandhi ’s last fast that he began on January 13, 1948 and finished on January 18, 1948 — to make Muslims feel safe in Independent India — hundreds marched from Lal Kuan to Jama Masjid on Saturday evening, carrying candles and banners saying ‘No to CAA, No to NRC’.

The candlelight march, which was organised under the ‘Not in my name’ banner culminated around 8pm and saw people assembling on the steps of Jama Masjid, where women, children and men sat in solidarity with the ‘women of Shaheen Bagh’ and countless other protests taking place across the country.

Referring to Mahatma Gandhi’s ‘Delhi Declaration’ when he broke his fast on January 18, after he was provided assurances and signatures from hundreds of organisations that Muslims would not be harmed in the country, one of the protesters, Rahul Roy, said a similar atmosphere prevailed now as it did post-Partition. “We all know what the atmosphere was back then and Muslims were being hunted and driven out of their homes. There was hate all around. We are seeing a similar hate right now and therefore it is time to remind those who are dividing the country that India has never belonged to a particular religion,” he said.

“The Constitution is what binds us together and we are secular and always have been,” said Roy, adding that it was important for each and every individual to stand up like Gandhi did during those times.

Those who gathered at the site on Saturday said they were not willing to stop at any cost, until the act was taken back by the government. “The government is adamant they will not take CAA back, but we too will stay our ground and not budge. These protests will continue, as a sign that the country is not happy with their decision,” said Qalim Ahmed, a local resident.

Fauzia, a housewife who has been a part of several such protests now said more and more women were stepping forward, inspired by the Shaheen Bagh protests. “We are doing whatever we can in our own small way. Women are gathering in small numbers in different parts of the country and ultimately these numbers are swelling up.”

The march included people who came from different parts of the country. Nawaz Qureshi and Ab Rahman Alam Khan, both members of the student wing of AIMIM said they had travelled to Delhi especially to take part in the protests at Shaheen Bagh.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: A notorious robber managed to evade police for about three weeks by hiding himself among protesters at Shaheen Bagh . He ran out of luck on Friday when cops in plainclothes nabbed him.

A resident of Shaheen Bagh, Mohammad Amir, along with his two accomplices, had allegedly robbed and shot at a trader in west Delhi’s Subhash Nagar on December 24. With the help of the CCTV footage, the cops identified the three accused within 24 hours. They managed to nab Shahid from his residence in Jamia Nagar.

But when they raided Amir’s house and tried to arrest him, he fled and mingled with the anti-CAA protesters. He also started sloganeering against police, forcing the cops to retreat. Even during subsequent attempts of police to nab him, Amir used the same ploy to evade arrest. On several instances, he even spread rumours about an impending police action on the protesters.

“Finally, the cops in plainclothes were deployed in the area around Shaheen Bagh to track his movements. It was found that he would return to the protest site every evening and hide during the day. On Friday, while he was heading to the protest site, police nabbed him. The team was led by SHO Rajouri Garden, Anil Sharma,” said a police officer.

A countrymade pistol and several rounds were seized .

During interrogation, the accused admitted to have been involved in at least a dozen robbery cases in Delhi and Noida.

Police are now trying to find out whether Amir was involved in the violence during the anti-CAA protests as well.

NAGPUR: Citing VIP movement on West High Court Road as one of the three reasons, the city traffic police department has revoked permission given for organizing Happy Streets between 6am and 10am on Sundays. There will be no Happy Streets for people to do yoga, Zumba, cycling, walking and other fitness and fun-related activities on January 19.

Senior PI from Sitabuldi traffic zone Jayesh Bhandarkar, in a letter issued to municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar on Saturday afternoon, said, “The joint commissioner of police issued a notification dated December 18, 2019 for temporarily stopping traffic on West High Court Road between Law College Square and Laxmi Bhuvan Square for organizing Happy Streets. There is VIP movement since morning on January 19. Due to stopping of traffic on the stretch, some people including those residing in nearby localities were facing problems. Also, examination of SSC and HSC is nearing. In larger public interest, the notification is revoked,” the officer said.

Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit, who resides near Times Square on West High Court Road, is in city since Thursday and will leave on Sunday afternoon. TOI has learnt from sources in police that some VIPs are likely to visit Purohit on Sunday morning.

In association with the Nagpur Municipal Corporation, The Times of India and Maharashtra Times started Happy Streets on December 22 last year and continued for four Sundays till January 12. Permission from Ambazari and Sitabuldi police stations, and NMC’s Dharampeth Zone office was available till February 9. The police notification by joint CP for blocking and diversion of traffic was till March 1.

Taking into consideration that Std X and Std XII exams were to begin from mid-February, TOI-MT had decided to end Happy Streets on February 2.

From 10,000 on the first Sunday, Happy Streets had attracted more than 20,000 on the last three sessions. Since Happy Streets offered activities across several age groups, the young and old had thronged the event.

Mayor Sandip Joshi, home minister Anil Deshmukh, guardian minister Nitin Raut , Bangar, West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre, Bhandarkar, corporator Sanjay Bangale and others were the dignitaries who visited Happy Streets and got mesmerized by the huge participation. Most felt that Happy Streets should continue throughout the year.

Civil Lines resident Mahendra Jichkar said, “It’s unfortunate that Happy Streets will not happen. Along with my family members and group of Vidarbha Volleyball Association Club, I had participated on all four Sundays. Earlier we used to go to a club on Sundays but shifted to Happy Streets once it started,” he said.

Last Sunday, Jichkar and his group celebrated the birthday of one of its members during Happy Streets. “It is a perfect place for family, especially children and senior citizens to learn how to be fit and the advantages of waking up early in the morning. Happy Streets had become our home,” added Jichkar.

TOI and MT had engaged an event management company to manage the event. A posse of 28 volunteers, 22 security guards and other staff were deployed to manage parking and to ensure no inconvenience is caused. There were complaints from four groups which were pro-actively sorted. TOI-MT is now flooded with requests to hold Happy Streets in other parts of the city.

Atrey Layout resident Tapan Suryawanshi said, “Happy Streets is the city’s most popular and lovable event. We wish it can continue in all Sundays.”

215,['19/01/2020'],Cotton yarn spinners may see margin squeeze on lower exports,"China accounted for 35% and Pakistan 5% of India’s yarn exports in fiscal 2019. (File photo)

AHMEDABAD: Cotton yarn spinners may find their operating margins in a squeeze with a drop in exports to China and Pakistan . The consequent oversupply in the domestic market as well as the narrowing gap between cotton and yarn prices are likely to reduce the margin of spinning mills by 2-4% in 2019-20.US-China trade war has impacted demand for yarn in China, while the Indian government banned yarn exports to Pakistan. China accounted for 35% and Pakistan 5% of India’s yarn exports in fiscal 2019.“Cotton yarn exports from Gujarat to China has declined noticeably in the wake of US-China trade war. Margins are under pressure. Hence, mills are suffering. Cotton yarn spinning is already a low margin business and reduction in exports has added to the woes of the industry,” said Dilip Patel, vice-chairman, Spinners Association Gujarat (SGA).The difference between the prices of cotton and yarn has narrowed, making spinning a low-margin business. International cotton prices declined 15% between April and October 2019, while domestic prices fell only 10% during this period because of an increase in minimum support price (MSP), which rendered India’s cotton yarn exports uncompetitive.Recently, CRISIL Ratings stated that China and Pakistan have reduced imports from India by 50-60% this fiscal. As a result, exports in the first seven months of fiscal 2020 were lower by 38%. An analysis by the rating agency suggests that the operating margins for large spinners having spinning capacity of 50,000 and more spindles could lower by 2% in fiscal 2020. The small-size mills’ operating margins could reduce by 4%.“Although the demand has improved in last one and a half month, the spinners had to face a tough time before that. Spinners’ margins are declining due to lower exports,” agreed Bharat Boghra, chairman, SGA.Medium- and small-sized spinners (having spindles less than 20,000) are likely to be impacted the most, as shrinking revenue and lower margin will impact cash generation.Considering recent reduction in domestic cotton prices and stable international cotton prices, profitability of spinners in second half of fiscal 2020 should be higher than in the first half. However, this may not be sufficient to offset the steep negative impact on profitability seen in the first half.“We should focus on value addition as it will benefit everyone in the value chain. India produces around 4 crore bales of cotton and all this should be used to make garments locally. I strongly believe that government should encourage establishment of more garmenting units and exports of garments rather than raw cotton or yarn,” Patel added.“Government should promote manufacturing of garments locally. I believe rather than exporting yarns, we should export garments,” Dilip Patel, vice-chairman, SAGAlthough the demand has improved in last one and a half months, the spinners had to face tough time before that.

JAIPUR: Suchitra (22) from Sikar has become the youngest sarpanch in the state and the second in the country after Himachal Pradesh’s Jabna Chauhan, who also became the village head at the same age in 2016.

Suchitra was elected to the post from Lalasi gram panchayat under Laxmangarh panchayat samiti defeating her nearest rival by 343 votes. While she polled 1427 votes, Manohar Singh bagged 1,084 from a seat which is reserved for OBC candidates.

She believes “more and more youths should realise that only they can bring a positive change in society” and that both women and youth should get more opportunities in electoral politics.

“My father (Rajendra Singh), who is a social worker, inspired me to contest the elections. It was my father's wish,"" said Suchitra, who is presently pursuing Masters in political science from Shri Bhagwandas Todi College in Laxmangarh, Sikar.

""I am also preparing for Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teacher (REET) examination,"" she added, who has two brothers who are still studying. Speaking about her plans on becoming a sarpanch, Suchitra said, “I would work towards helping people get employment, solve water woes in the gram panchayat and bring about swachhata (cleanliness). I want to fight all kinds of malpractices in society.""

Apart from social work, her father ekes out a living through farming.

NAGPUR: Pointing out that institutions are not just brick and mortar, Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde on Saturday said universities were not supposed to function like an assembly line production unit.

Speaking at Nagpur University (NU)’s 107th convocation, the CJI said, “It is also very important to emphasize that university degrees aren’t an end in themselves. Most importantly, the idea of a university reflects what we want to achieve as a society.”

While speaking at another function organized by the National Law University (NLU) at Vanamati, Justice Bobde said India’s first ever college that will produce judges — National Judicial Academy — which is his brain child, should become a reality soon. For this project, Bobde had entrusted the help of former HC judge Ravindra Chavan and National Academy of Legal Studies and Research (NALSAR) university professor Faisan Mustafa.

Expressing concern over the commercialization of education, the CJI said it was unfortunate that some institutions were extremely money-minded. “Unfortunately, as NU has become a parent to many universities and education is being proliferated, there are some institutions which are into such commercial practices; I can say this from personal knowledge.”

The most important question which needs to be addressed immediately is the purpose of university education, said Bobde. “The idea of a university reflects what we want to achieve as a society. There is a huge difference between education and literacy. The word education comes from ‘educate’, which means ‘to bring forth or awaken the faculties in a student’. It is different from imposing ideas,” he asserted.

Quoting Martin Luther King Junior’s words, the CJI said, “The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character — that is the goal of true education.”

Bobde called on universities to attune research and teaching towards societal well-being by appreciation and resolution of its problems through the curriculum. “It is equally important for graduating students to realize what is expected of them. In a society, interdependence is as important a virtue as independence,” he said.

“A university degree gives one a tool to chisel one’s future. What one carves out through the help of the tool is the choice and wisdom of the craftsman, as tools don’t chisel on their own,” Bobde added.

Exhorting students to utilize their time well, he said success came to those who did it efficiently. “Today, the world is moving to machine learning, genetic astrology of future diseases, hacking of hormones and what not. It’s an exciting time to be entering the professional world.”

Concluding his speech with a quote from the Upanishad — which was cited by former CJI Mohammed Hidyatullah during his convocation address in the Annamalai University — Justice Bobde said NU had done exceedingly well over the years by producing brilliant students who distinguished themselves in all walks of life, and that he was confident that it would continue its good work.

“Your formal university learning may have come to an end, but the process still continues. There's an assumption that growing up is an inevitable and natural progression of life. It is just a function of age and occurs with the passage of time,” he signed off.

NASHIK: A woman was duped of Rs 48,980 by an online fraudster on December 31 after she clicked on a link sent to her mobile phone for updating her know your customer (KYC) details.

An offence in this regard has been registered with the cybercrime police station.

Police said that the 42-year-old woman, a resident of Indiranagar, told them that she was cheated by a conman in an online fraud. The complainant told police that the fraudster claimed to be an executive of a private pay wallet agency.

The suspect sent a link to her mobile phone and asked her to update her details after clicking on the said link.

The complainant told police that when she clicked on the said link, Rs 48,890 cash was withdrawn from her husband’s bank account which was connected to the private pay wallet.

The cybercrime police said that they are investigating the case in details, adding that they have come across similar cases in the past.

On January 11, a city-based woman was cheated of Rs 47,000 by a conman who claimed to be a representative of an online payment wallet company and sought her bank details for opening an account with them.

The woman readily provided details of her bank account following which the conman withdrew Rs 47,000 from her account. The women lodged a complaint with the cybercrime police station on January 13.

Police said that these conmen pretend to be bank representatives and send random messages to people who often fall prey to their tactics.

A large number of cheating cases are registered with the police on a regular basis throughout the year, despite the awareness being spread among people asking them to avoid falling prey to the tactics of online fraudsters who send e-mails/SMSes or even make calls pretending to be bank executives, said police.

HYDERABAD: The residents of over 36 villages under Shamshabad municipality say that despite having an international airport in their area, there has not been much development. The lack of a fire station and safe drinking water and GO-111, that prohibits the construction of housing colonies or industrial ventures within a 10km radius of Himayatsagar and Osmansagar reservoirs, are some of the complaints by residents in the area.The airport is planned near the three villages of Shamshabad which fall within the 10km radius. “The government giving permission for expansion of the airport makes no sense without developing the villages around it and scrapping GO-111,” said Mohammad Sameer, a resident of Peddashapur village in Shamshabad.“Despite the international airport located here, the infrastructure in Shamshabad has been neglected for too long. Except for a road leading to the airport, the villages in the municipality have not seen any development in years. Even to this day, there is no access to several villages due to lack of connecting roads,” said Shobha, a resident.Many complain that the issues have gone unresolved despite multiple representations to government authorities. “We don’t even have proper street lights in our area. Drinking water is a problem. The Krishna water that we get is not very clean and we have to buy water cans from private sellers,” said Shobha.Another resident, Iftekhar Shareef said: “If GO-111 is scrapped and HMDA starts giving permission, there will be development in this municipality. Since it is an airport area, HMDA permissions don’t have to be for multi-storied (buildings), it should just be kept for residential permit for two or maximum three floors and strictly according to the norms of HMDA. Apart from GO-111, the drainage from all the villages flowing into Kamuni cheruvu (lake) is also a major problem.

NAGPUR: Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde on Saturday unveiled a book penned by former Bombay High Court judge Ravindra Chavan at a function organized by National Law University (NLU) at Vanamati on Saturday.

He also released NLU’s special issue in memory of professor NR Madhava Menon and his contribution to Indian legal education titled ‘Nagpur Contemporary Law Review (Volume 3)’.

The CJI was accompanied by Supreme Court judge Bhushan Gavai, senior administrative judge at Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court Ravi Deshpande, Justice Chavan and NLU vice chancellor Prof Vijender Kumar on the dais.

Justice Bobde informed that Chavan’s book ‘More Cries in the Wilderness’ was his second and the first one was released in 2000 at the Sahyadri guesthouse in Mumbai. “I am a great admirer of him and his work. I had the pleasure of working with him on a bench in Goa. The size of a case or the voice of advocates would never deter him and that is a rare quality to find in judges. After completing his tenure as a judge, Justice Chavan’s concern for the judiciary is as alive as it was when he was a member of the judicial fraternity. He has zeal and he makes it available to whoever seeks it,” said Bobde.

In his address, justice Gavai said, “Justice Chavan has a vision as to how a modern and model judiciary should be. Whatever he has written, he did it with his heart, especially about how advocates should practice advocacy and how judges should perform judicial functions.”

He pointed out that the former judge never feels shy of expressing what he thinks. “His work will be thought provoking. It will encourage a wide discussion in the fraternity and the book will surely shape the future of the judicial system.”

Speaking about Professor Menon, Justice Gavai said, “He pioneered and reformed the Indian legal education system. There is an emphasis on practical training and moot court trials in NLUs which has helped students cultivate the lawyer in them. Education provided by NLUs will go a long way in cultivating good values, mannerisms and building an ethical practice in budding lawyers.”

The High Court Bar Association (HCBA) and District Bar Association (DBA) office-bearers also attended the event in large number, besides SC judge Vikas Sirpurkar.

Talasani Srinivas Yadav

HYDERABAD: Refuting the BJP’s claims that TRS and All India Majlis-Ittehadul Muslineen (AIMIM) have a deal for the municipal elections and had even allocated some seats to AIMIM, TRS minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav said that there was no such understanding. The minister said that AIMIM was confined to some pockets in the city and state and warned that legal action will be taken against those who spread rumours on social media.

Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Talasani said that some parties were resorting to a campaign stating that TRS had allocated some municipalities such as Tandur to AIMIM. He asked as to why Congress has not fielded candidates against AIMIM in certain areas and why BJP had been trying to secure votes “in the name of religion.” “TRS is secular party. Congress and BJP, which have not been able to put up candidates in hundreds of wards, are now resorting to a smear campaign against TRS,” the minister said.

Talasani also said his party was ready for an open debate with Union minister G Kishan Reddy on central assistance to the state after municipal elections results. The minister exuded confidence that TRS would sweep the civic polls and hoped that welfare schemes would help them in getting majority across municipalities. He also targeted the Congress manifesto stating that it was made “as if they were in power.”

HYDERABAD: In an attempt to prevent impersonation cases in municipal elections, the Telangana State Election Commission (TSEC) has decided to implement a face recognition application. It will be implemented on a pilot basis for voter verification in 10 polling stations in Komapally.

The phone-based app will be used by additional polling officers who will first verify the identity proof of the voter and then take a photograph and upload to the server using face recognition app installed on their phone. “The app displays the results of verification based on the match in the form of a message. A negative return from this pilot exercise shall not be sufficient grounds to deny voting rights to any voter and it needs to be corroborated by the existing identification systems,” the SEC said.

TSEC secretary M Ashok Kumar said that despite having various mechanisms to check voters identity, tender votes were recorded in the previous local body polls and there was a violation of voting procedure which led to re-poll in all those cases.The SEC said that there may have been more impersonation cases but have not come to the notice of the election authorities.

“The Telangana State Technological Services (TSTS) has been using facial recognition to validate the identity of pensioners. This is an additional step taken to validate the identity of the voters like photo electoral rolls and photo ID proofs,” the TSEC secretary said and added that photographs taken during the verification would not be stored or used for any other purpose except for polling.

HYDERABAD: The battle for Sangareddy municipal polls has seen TRS and Congress train their big guns on each other. Finance minister T Harish Rao has taken to the campaign trail for TRS candidates while Congress MLA T Jayaprakash Reddy (Jagga Reddy) has taken up the task for his party. “You should vote for a buffalo that gives milk rather than a bull that can be of no use,” Harish Rao said during a road show in Sangareddy. The finance minister alleged that Jagga Reddy was “someone who talked big but delivered nothing.”

On the other hand, Jagga Reddy too has been a vocal critic of the TRS and Harish Rao. “How can Harish Rao even dare to campaign here. He has no moral right...he diverted waters from here and TRS’ Medak MP Prabhakar Reddy did nothing about it,” Jagga Reddy had said a few days ago.

The Congress legislator has fielded his wife, Nirmala Jayaprakash Reddy from Ward No 22 for councillor. He expressed confidence that Congress would secured victory in 22 out of the 38 wards.

The legislator attributed his confidence to his victory in the assembly polls of 2018 in which he won the seat back from TRS’ Chinta Prabhakar.

“Congress leaders are spending a lot of money to win polls but the government released Rs 36 crore for the development of Sangareddy. You should know who is working for the people,” Harish Rao said during Saturday’s road show and added: “The MLA (Jagga Reddy) thanked CM K Chandrasekhar Rao for sanctioning a medical college in Sangareddy and is now criticising the CM again.”

As the battle for municipal seats heats up, both Harish Rao and Jagga Reddy are leaving no stone unturned in trying to ensure wins for their respective parties in the Sadashiv and Sangareddy municipalities.

HYDERABAD: Despite the repeated warnings by TRS leadership, rebel candidates still pose a threat to the ruling party’s chances in the civic elections. It is understood that many rebels are likely to influence the chances of victory for party candidates across several wards.The TRS leadership is worried as some former ministers, ex-MLAs and senior party workers were allegedly behind the rebels’ who defied the party’s decision and even supported them against the party’s official candidates.While the deadline for withdrawal of nominations ended on January 14, TRS candidates are still making efforts to convince rebels to not campaign and support the party instead. In their last-ditch efforts, some official candidates are allegedly offering sums ranging between Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh to rebels in a bid to win their support.“A major problem with ex-councillors and ex-chairpersons is that they could not be given tickets due to caste considerations and other issues. A former chairperson was not given a ticket due to poor record and survey rating. Similarly, in municipalities such as Mancherial, Belllampally and other municipalities sitting councillors were not considered,” said a senior TRS worker. “They may split some TRS votes and help opposition party candidates,” he admitted. The problem, however, is not only confined to TRS with other parties such as BJP and Congress also facing similar problems.In Sircilla’s Vemulawada municipality, nine TRS rebels are in the fray and are likely to impact the official candidates’ chances in at least four places. According to party sources, rebels in Wards 4, 17, 24 and 26 are considered to be strong candidates. Even in chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s Gajwel constituency, rebels pose a threat to candidates’ chances in at least five to six wards. Many refused to withdraw even after requests by Medak MP Kotha Prabhakar Reddy.In erstwhile Mahabubnagar district’s Kollapur, MLA B Harshawardhan Reddy is said to have told TRS working president KT Rama Rao that ex-minister Jupally Krishna Rao was behind the party rebels who had filed nominations on All India Forward Bloc tickets. KTR has said that stern action would be taken against rebels but the party will wait till counting was over on January 25. Finance minster T Harish Rao has said that those contesting against party candidates would not be taken back into the party-fold.TRS has even annouced that those who could not be accommodated would be considered for nominated and co-opt posts.

HYDERABAD: AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday took a jibe at the “two-child” policy proposed by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. “They ( BJP ) failed to provide employment. So they are insisting on two children policy. In 2018, 36 unemployed killed themselves every day. During the period an equal number of self-employed killed themselves,” said Owaisi.

Adressing a gathering Moradabad, Bhagwat had said that the RSS would support any law that insists on a two-child policy.

Earlier, the AIMIM chief challenged politicians who were allegedly spreading rumours about his second marriage to produce the woman in question if they were sincere. Owaisi said that he had even announced a reward for those spreading rumours if “they could find the second woman.” Addressing a public meeting in Kamareddy, Owaisi slammed both Congress and BJP whom he accused of making personal remarks about his family. “Congress leaders have joined hands with the people who attacked Akbaruddin,” he alleged.

Taking aim at Rahul Gandhi, Owaisi said: “Had I contested in Amethi, your party president would not stay in electoral race.”Owaisi said that AIMIM will be fighting the municipal polls independently and clarified that there was no alliance between his party and TRS.

NASHIK : The operators at the toll plaza are forced to keep more than one lane for motorists without FASTags as a large number of motorists arrive at the toll plaza without the FASTags.

It was decided that from January 15, only one lane at the toll plazas will be a cash lane, and the rest would be for electronic toll collection (ETC) through FASTags.

Senior officials of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) said that more than 60% of motorists at the toll plazas are without FASTags. Thus, if only one lane is kept open for motorists without FASTags, it would lead to chaos. Hence, it was decided to keep more than one cash collection lane open.

NHAI officials said that of the 10 lanes at the Ghoti toll plaza, with five from each side, they have kept two lanes for ETC and eight lanes for cash collection.

At Pimpalgaon toll plaza, a total of 16 lanes, with eight on each side, there are four cash lane and eight ETC lanes. Of the 10 lanes at Chandwad toll plaza, two are for cash and eight for ETC.

At Chandwad toll plaza which has a total 10 lanes, two are open for cash and eight for ETC.

NHAI officials said that vehicles with FASTags were zooming past the toll plaza without wasting time in the long queues of the cash lanes. Motorists without the FASTag , entering the ETC lane have to pay double the amount of the toll fee.

Meanwhile, the police have made bandobast at the toll plazas to take action in case of an untoward incident due to the rush at the toll plazas.

NHAI officials said that the rush of vehicles would increase in the coming months because of wedding season and summer vacations. Thus, people have been appealed to get the FASTag at the earliest.

Many locals are not taking the FASTag as they are worried that they won’t get the concession in the toll fee since they are residing within the radius of 20 km of a toll plaza. Further, many motorists from Nashik whose cars and other vehicles have the registration number starting with MH 15 also enjoy concession at the Pimpalgaon toll plaza.

230,['19/01/2020'],Microfinance shows growth amid overall sluggish credit offtake,"Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Even as credit offtake remains weak amid slowdown pressures on businesses, the microfinance space in Gujarat has gained some traction. This can be seen from the 79% growth in loans provided by microfinance institutions (MFIs) in 2018-19. Microfinance has continued to record growth, albeit at a bit slower rate, in the first three quarters of the fiscal 2019-20. The rate of growth, however, has slowed a little in the current financial year.The gross loans extended by MFIs in Gujarat surged by Rs 873 crore to Rs 1,976 crore in 2018-19 from Rs 1,103 crore in 2017-18. By the quarter ended December 31, 2019, the gross portfolio rose to Rs 2,700 crore, which shows an increase of Rs 724 crore over the previous fiscal, reveals the data compiled by Sa-Dhan, a national-level association of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs).Credit growth of banks in Gujarat remained at 3.25% for the first six months of 2019-20, while the same was 9.5% in 2018-19, according to data compiled by the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC).Microfinance is meant for people who have typically low levels of income and require small loans. Typical borrowers from MFIs include small traders, vendors, and owners of microenterprises. The ticket size of borrowings from MFIs ranges from Rs 40,000 to Rs 1 lakh.“The credit offtake will not reduce for microfinance institutions because these loans are often enablers for livelihood creation and income-level improvement among the lower income groups,” SEWA Bank managing director Jayshree Vyas said while explaining the reasons for growth in microfinance loans. “For instance, one of our borrowers was a woman who was a bangle vendor,” Vyas said. “She wanted to make bangles herself and sell them for better income and sought a microfinance loan. With that she bought equipment and raw material to turn into a microentrepreneur.”Experts believe that MFIs have seen buoyant growth because the extension of microcredit to the lower income groups and microenterprises addresses their working capital requirements and enables them to improve their outputs more effectively.“Apart from working capital requirements, these loans also take care of consumption needs of the household,” said P Satish, executive director, Sa-Dhan. “Thus, there is always a demand for these loans and the credit offtake continues to grow.”Industry stakeholders also said that easy availability of loans from multiple avenues has strengthened MFI lending in Gujarat.“With easing of RBI norms enabling non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) to turn into small finance banks and accept deposits, more avenues for microfinance lending have opened up,” said Vyas. “As a result, borrowers now have multiple options for availing loans.” This has led to more competition among banks, Vyas said. “At the same time, several small moneylenders have turned into NBFCs,” she said. “All these factors give more options suitable to individual borrowers.”Despite the slowdown-like situation in the economy, the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) for MFIs in Gujarat is less than 1%.“Over the past three quarters, NPA is well within limits,” said Harshvardhan Lunia, co-founder, Lendingkart, which is an Ahmedabad-based fintech company. “While credit offtake continued to grow, the growth was marginally slow over the past nine months, especially in the second quarter of 2019-20.”Shishu loans under PMMYEstimates suggest that MFIs account for at least 90% of total borrowings for Shishu loans extended as part of the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana.According to the latest State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) report, the disbursement of Shishu loans under PMMY grew by 33% from Rs 1,561.63 crore in the third quarter of 2018-19 to Rs 2,076.25 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2019-20. During the same period, 1.72 lakh new loan accounts were added — recording a growth of 33%",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73373712,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-152154,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/microfinance-shows-growth-amid-overall-sluggish-credit-offtake/articleshow/73364030.cms

Representational image

PANAJI: After 43 human rabies deaths in the state between 2012 and 2017, the rigorous anti-rabies programme has helped Goa in bringing the cases of the fatal viral disease to zero.

While no cases of rabies were reported in 2018 and 2019, the health department is in no position to lower its guard, and is compelled to continue its anti-rabies vaccination drive due to the high incidence of dog bites .

Every year, Goa registers 17,000 to 19,000 dog bite cases, and the numbers are expected to go up with the rise in the stray canine population.

“The stray dog population will continue to increase as long as food is made available to them. The litter size (number of offspring per pregnancy) of dogs surviving on waste is smaller than that of stray dogs that get fed healthy food. I’m not advocating that the strays be killed,” state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said.

He said elimination of dogs is not the answer, while explaining the direct relationship between increasing dog bite cases and stray dog population.

This has not worked for those who tried it. “If all the dogs are removed from one area, it creates a vacuum and will attract strays from other areas due to the availability of garbage, or people feeding stray dogs,” he added.

A stray dog or any other dog that is fed good food, will litter six to eight puppies, while a dog sustaining on garbage will litter only two to three puppies— and the number will go down further if there is no food, he said.

Betodkar said the anti-rabies vaccination programme carried out through Mission Rabies in the state has helped in bringing down the cases of rabies to zero.

The DHS has an awareness programme about what should be done when bitten by a dog. It is set to repeat the advertisement they had run a year ago to create awareness about rabies.

A bite by a rabid dog or animal is 100 % fatal. The vaccine is likely to work only if it is administered as soon as possible after being bitten by a rabid dog, he said.

For better results, he said the rabies immunoglobulin is injected to kill the virus, as the vaccine takes seven days to generate antibodies and work effectively.

Vaccine shortage box

Following a warning by WHO in 2019, about the possible shortage of the anti-rabies vaccine, the DHS gave up on intra- muscular vaccination and has opted for intradermal rabies vaccination, which uses 60% to 80% less volume of the vaccine, according to the WHO.

While some states have been affected by the shortage of the rabies vaccine, Goa has not, said Dr Utkarsh Betodkar, state epidemiologist. “The shortage has been global,” he said ,adding further that Goa has not felt a shortage as it is using intradermal vaccine. It also costs less,” he said.

NASHIK: The city police are planning to have separate towing contractors for the five units of the traffic branch to ensure that proper action is taken against motorists flouting the no-parking zone rule across the city.

Senior police officers said that tenders from contractors interested in operating towing cranes and other vehicles to pick up illegally parked vehicles and bring them to the traffic branch office have been invited.

In October last year, the contract of towing vehicles was suspended following his inability to adhere to the terms and conditions laid down by police.

The contractor was told to set up a public address system on the towing vehicles, provide uniforms to his employees and verify thier background among other things. However, the contractor ignored the instructions, following which the deal was cancelled.

A senior police officer of the traffic branch said the process of appointing new contractors for towing is under way. “If all the four units have their own towing vehicles, action against wrongly parked vehicles can be taken in all parts of the city rather than only at some places.”

The officers said that the previous contractor only towed vehicles that were close to the police’s traffic branch office so that less fuel was consumed. The other parts of the city, however, continued to face the problem of illegal parking.

Currently, the problem of illegal parking has increased. It is especially seen on the newly developed smart city road opposite the district collectorate. The situation is no different on College Road, especially in the evenings.

Even in Nashik Road are, illegal parking can be seen between Bytco Junction and the Nashik Road police station during evening hours.

Unit one of the traffic branch comprises jurisdictions of Panchavati, Adgaon and Mhasrool police stations. Unit two consists of jurisdictions of Bhadrakali and Mumbai Naka, unit 3 comprises Ambad, Indiranagar and Satpur.

Unit four comprises Upnagar, Nashik Road and Deolali Camp and unit 5 has Sarkarwada and Gangapur areas under its jurisdiction.

The post of ZP president was reserved for SC (women). Rashmi Barve was elected unopposed

NAGPUR: Dairy development minister Sunil Kedar (Cong) prevailed over home minister Anil Deshmukh (NCP) as the former’s supporters bagged the posts of president and vice-president in Nagpur Zilla Parishad.

As Congress has 31 members out of a total 58, it was clear that the president would be from the party. However, its pre-poll ally NCP had won 10 seats and Deshmukh wanted to make his son Salil the vice-president. Kedar, however, refused to yield as he did not need the support of NCP.

The post of ZP president was reserved for SC (women). Rashmi Barve was elected unopposed. Chandrashekhar Kolhe, Dinesh Bang and Manohar Kumbhare had filed nominations for the post of vice-president but the first two withdrew at the last moment paving the way for Kedar supporter Kumbhare’s unopposed election.

In Akola ZP, BJP helped Prakash Ambedkar ’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) retain the posts of president and vice-president. Akola ZP house has a strength of 53 while VBA’s figure was 22. It needed five more members to bag the posts. However, only three independents declared support and VBA was two short of majority.

Sensing that VBA did not have the numbers, leaders of Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP – constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi — held a series of meetings to capture the ZP. They wooed the independents with plum posts. However, they were also unable to muster the numbers and BJP with seven members was the key to government formation.

As BJP wanted to prevent MVA from coming to power at any cost, its seven members walked out of the House during the election reducing its strength from 53 to 46. Now VBA needed only 24 members to get its presidential candidate elected and it had 25 members.

Pratibha Bhojane and Savitri Rathod of VBA were elected as president and vice-president respectively.

In Washim ZP, Chandrakant Thakre of NCP was elected as president while Arvind Patil Ingole of Congress was elected vice-president. BJP or the other parties did not field candidates for these posts.

Meanwhile, in the Panchayat Samiti (PS) elections held in the district on Friday, Congress and NCP had the upper hand. There are 13 PSs in the district of which Congress bagged 8, NCP 2, NCP ally Shetkari Kamgar Paksh 1 and BJP 2.

Rekha Warthi of Congress is president of Nagpur Rural PS, Umesh Radke (BJP) – Kamptee, Ashwini Shivankar (BJP) – Kuhi, Ramesh Kilkane (Congress) – Umred, Durga Thaokar (Congress) – Mouda, Mamta Shende (Congress) – Bhiwapur, Baban Awhale (NCP) – Hingna, Meena Kawale (Congress) – Parseoni, Dhammapal Khobragade (Shetkari Kamgar Paksh) – Katol, Nilima Rewatkar (NCP) – Narkhed, Shravan Bhingare (Congress) – Kalmeshwar, Aruna Shinde (Congress) – Saoner and Kala Thakre (Congress) – Ramtek.

Despite having an alliance with the Sena at the state level, Congress and NCP leaders did not have any tie-up with the party in the district. Sena won only one seat in Nagpur ZP.

237,['19/01/2020'],Two capsule pumping stns to ease water worry in S Kol from this week,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Kolkata: Inauguration of two capsule booster pumping stations this week will help citizens in large parts of south Kolkata draw more filtered water this summer.

The first station will be opened at Deshapriya Park on Tuesday. The station, with a capacity to store 15 lakh litres of filtered water, will cater to the demand of potable water in large areas such as Mahanirvan Road, Tilak Road, Deshapriya Park and Manoharpukur Road among others.

Successful completion of the capsule booster pumping station will also ensure that residents in the Deshapriya Park area are no longer dependent on groundwater.

According to a KMC water supply department official, despite being prime south Kolkata localities, people of some areas adjacent to Deshapriya Park were heavily dependent on groundwater. “With the completion of the booster pumping station at Deshapriya Park, we will be able to shut down two major tubewells in the area. These tubewells are located in Deshapriya Park and Monoharpukur,” he said.

Balai Mitra, a businessman and resident of Monoharpukur Road, said the station was long due in the locality. “I am happy now that we will be able to access safe drinking water. We hope the booster pumping station will ensure more water for the residents of the areas,” Mitra said.

The second such station that is slated to be inaugurated on Wednesday will ensure augmented filtered water supply for residents of Bhowanipore.

The station, which has been constructed near Bakulbagan, will cater to the demands of residents of Bakulbagan Row, Townshend Road, Ramesh Mitra Road and Beltola Road. The station with a capacity to store 12.5 lakh litres of filtered water will be beneficial to more than 10,000 residents of Bhowanipore when there is a surge in demand for drinking water during summer.

“This booster pumping station has been set up to meet growing demands for filtered water among a section of Bhowanipore residents. Come March, residents will reap benefits of this station in a big way,” said another water supply department official.

Nibedita Bose, a retired teacher and resident of Ramesh Mitra Road, felt that the new booster pumping station would definitely meet the extra demands for filtered water during summer. “Ever since we heard about construction of the booster pumping station, we had been eagerly waiting for it to start operations. Now, with its completion, we hope that we don’t have to suffer from water crisis this summer,” Bose said.

ER and KMC officials test food samples at Sealdah station

KOLKATA: How safe is the food served to passengers on trains and at stations? On Saturday, officials from the medical department of Eastern Railway (ER), along with a Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) team, tested the food at the Sealdah station with the help of mobile units known as ‘ Food Safety on Wheels’.

These vans not only facilitate the testing of food items and ingredients on the spot, they also provide training on food safety. This was under a scheme initiated by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).

“It’s a two-pronged approach. The primary objective is to ensure supply of good quality food to passengers while the second is to caution food suppliers that such tests can be carried out any time and they should not be negligent. During the day, nine samples were picked up at random from the executive ounge, base kitchen, Jan Ahaar outlet and the food court. All the items were found safe for human consumption,” said ER CPRO Nikhil Kumar Chakraborty.

“A training and certification programme for food handlers and supervisors was also conducted at Sealdah. Passengers were urged to update themselves on safe eating habits and report any issue with the food served to them at stations or on trains. Sanghamitra Chatterjee, ER additional chief medical superintendent, and Sarmistha Mukhopadhyay, food analyst, KMC, were present during the campaign. This will be extended to other stations under ER soon,” Chakraborty added.

AHMEDABAD: With an eye on bigger play at the national level, more companies from Gujarat are now roping in Bollywood stars as their brand ambassadors. Even those from smaller towns like Rajkot and Morbi , too, have jumped on the celebrity bandwagon.

Sample this: Rajkot-based Balaji Wafers has appointed actor Ayushmann Khurrana as its brand ambassador as the company aims to take a big leap on to the national stage. Morbi’s ceramic tiles and sanitaryware maker Simpolo Ceramics has appointed Hrithik Roshan as its brand ambassador.

Anil Kapoor has been associated with Qutone Ceramics, a tiles company headquartered at Ahmedabad, as its brand ambassador for the past four years. Bollywood actress Kriti Sanon till recently endorsed Oasis Tiles from Morbi. Men’s grooming startup like Beardo has also brought in a number of film actors to endorse its brand.

“We wanted to distinguish ourselves from other tiles makers in Morbi and position Simpolo among top brands in India. We want to promote tiles as a lifestyle product. This is our first year of association with Hrithik Roshan,” said Jitendra Aghara, managing director, Simpolo Ceramics, which has a turnover of Rs 735 crore.

“Qutone is the first company to have roped in a Bollywood celebrity to promote ceramic tiles. Previously, celebs were brought in to predominantly promote sanitaryware products but not the ceramic tiles,” said Manoj Agarwal, CMD, Qutone Ceramics.

“In his early 60s, Anil Kapoor is considered one of the most energetic stars. Through him, we wanted to convey a message to our consumers that our brand — like Kapoor — is ageless and its charm grows with the time,” he added. Backed by innovation as well as R&D, Qutone turnover has grown to Rs 650 crore at present from Rs 150 crore in 2016.

The tile makers seem to have taken cue from the top brands like Kajaria Ceramics , Cera Sanitaryware and Somany Ceramics who have celebrities as their brand ambassadors.

“Bollywood has tremendous influence over the Indian society and individual behaviour. Hence, Bollywood celebrities become a natural choice for brands with national aspirations; especially those which have achieved some critical mass in terms of sales turnover and geographical reach,” said Santosh Zokarkar, creative director, Mantra Media, a digital consulting company.

“In any product category, early entrants enjoy many advantages. And late entrants must find a niche or do something different to connect with the audience. Celebrities are opinion leaders and they wield immense influence over the audience. Hence, they are roped in as brand ambassadors,” Zokarkar added.

Rasna, Adani Wilmar, Zydus Wellness and Astral Poly Technik are some of the popular names from Gujarat which have used brand ambassadors for their products.

“We want to position Simpolo among top brands in India. Hence, we have roped in Hrithik Roshan as our brand ambassador,” Jitendra Aghara, MD, Simpolo Ceramics

Kolkata: A 58-year-old manager of an edible oil and agro products firm became a victim of snatching in Behala on Friday evening. Police said that the victim — Tarapada Dey — was on his way from the godown to the firm’s retail store carrying Rs 5.4 lakh when he was attacked by two men, barely 300 metres from Biren Roy Road West and less than 500 metres from the Diamond City (West) complex. The incident was reported around 6.45pm.

The two assaulted the elderly man when he refused to part with the money leaving him with multiple injuries. The two accused then took away the money, ran some distance on to a wider road, hopped on to a bike parked nearby and then fled towards the bylanes of Saptagram (Parnasree) even as the victim shouted for help.

The Parnasree police have registered a case of snatching and are further investigating the case. The CCTV footage of the area — especially the one installed at a clinic nearby — has provided important leads, claimed police.

“For the past three years, I have been depositing daily collections from the godown at our main shop every evening. On Friday, I was barely a few hundred metres from the Biren Roy Road when a tall man — with a strong built — jumped on me from behind an open window of a flat and held me from the back. He kept a hand on my mouth so that I could not shout. But I did not give up and we kept struggling with for a few seconds,” he said.

“A second person then arrived at the spot and hit me on my shoulders from behind. A punch also landed on my face. As I fell, the accused fled with the money. I did shout for help and at least two people saw the duo running away with the money towards a bike. As I kept shouting for help, locals gathered. But they could not trace the bike or the two men,” Dey told TOI.

The southwest division officers said that the Sarsuna police along with detective department are providing additional inputs.

“The area has never witnessed any such crime before. I have been staying with my wife for several years here at Saptagram without any fear. I believe the accused had prior knowledge of my movement and hence I will request cops to look in to this angle,” said Dey.

CM Trivendra Singh Rawat

DEHRADUN: The family of Rajendra Singh Negi, a Garhwal Rifles soldier who went missing while patrolling along the India-Pakistan border areas on January 8, are gradually losing hope of his return. Army’s manhunt for Negi hasn’t yielded any positive outcome so far. Negi, posted in Gulmarg , was on duty in a heavily-snowed border area when he went missing.

Speaking with TOI, the missing soldier’s brother Dinesh Singh Negi, who is an ex-serviceman, said that survival possibility in the terrain, which receives heavy snowfall, is slim especially as ten days have passed since he went missing. “It is very difficult to stay alive at high altitude during snow and the chances of survival after getting trapped in snow blizzards or avalanches beyond five days are too low. So, our hope for my brother’s survival is less,” he said.

On Saturday, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat also met Union defence minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi and urged to intensify efforts to trace Rajendra Singh Negi. However, Negi’s family said that too much time was wasted after the soldier went missing from duty.

“Ideally, the government should have immediately swung into action. The search operation wasn’t quick enough,” Dinesh Singh Negi alleged.

The missing jawan ’s family members also demanded a thorough probe into the incident and 'Standard Operation Procedures' violations which might have led to the incident.

“We were told that he was alone while being sent for clearing snow. This is quite strange as single jawan movement is not allowed and everyone is given a comrade while on the move,” Dinesh Singh Negi said, while adding that the Army court must probe all aspects of the incident.

Negi originally hails from Chamoli and as per Army rules, the police had filed a complaint about his missing there. His family had moved to Dehradun where his wife Rajeshwari Devi and kids — Anjali, 14, Priyanshu, 12, and Meenakshi , 10, live.

At least one waiter from a Park Circus hotel is under suspicion for allegedly abetting the two accused — Mudassar Khan and Irfanuddin. “One cannot easily spot the difference between a original card swiping machine and a skimmer machine. They look almost the same to untrained eyes. So one will not know while keying the PIN if s/he is doing it on a swiping or a skimming machine,” claimed an officer. Sources said a couple of more arrests are likely in this case.

“The accused had provided the waiter with a skimming device, which can copy data from an original card in less than a few seconds. The two men — who did not pass Class X and dropped out of school thereafter — learnt the tricks from YouTube videos and have been operational for the past eight months. Once the restaurant worker managed to lay his hands on a card, he would manage to either get the patron to part with his PIN or watched him closely as he keyed it in. This waiter would then take the card to a corner close to the kitchen and get the card duplicated using the skimming machine. He was paid handsomely by the duo for each data he collected. The money was then withdrawn either from Siliguri, Kurseong, Darjeeling or Shillong,” said an investigating officer.

Police sources said there are ways one can be careful not to fall in the trap of skimmers at restaurants. “Usually, the first line of your defence is that if you cannot insert your chip card with your thumb pointed at the device and instead has your thumb remaining fully on your card, do not enter your PIN. The easier ways is to cover the card while inserting your PIN and never letting the waiter get hold of your card,” said an anti-bank fraud section officer.

Once the gang skimmed an ATM card, they would return to an ATM around midnight and make two transactions, one before midnight and the other right after 12am. “This allowed the gang to make maximum withdrawals for two consecutive days,” said a senior police officer.

Sources said they suspected the accused had been in touch with a larger gang in Bihar. “They might be operating the gang in Kolkata – with them having residences at Noor Ali Lane and Tiljala Road – but they had been inducted by someone who is operating from Gaya. There is a diverse chain of people who are part of the gang,” said an officer.

Among other things, police are trying to establish the money trail to ensure a stronger chargesheet against the accused. “Establishing the money trail will help us find where and how the accused parked their money. It will also help us trace the gang leaders,” said an investigating officer.

245,['19/01/2020'],Govt to hold tripartite meet ahead of paddy procurement,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Trichy: After a gap of four years, a tripartite meeting to discuss about paddy procurement in delta districts is going to be held on January 21 in Thanjavur.

Food minister R Kamaraj on Saturday said that the meeting is to be conducted following the demands put forth by the farming community. “Officials from all concerned departments will participate in the meet. Farmers can express their views and air their grievances during the meeting,” the minister added.

Before announcing procurement policy of kharif season, the state government would convene a tripartite meeting, where agriculture and food minister, Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) MD, collectors of delta districts, officials from the agriculture department, Regional Managers of TNCSC and representatives of farmers’ associations would participate.

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has instructed to open maximum number of direct procurement centres (DPCs) to meet the requirements of farmers, Kamaraj said.

“Without waiting for the Union government to announce minimum support price (MSP), Tamil Nadu government has been announcing incentive for paddy,” he added.

During the first phase, a total of 50 DPCs were opened in Nagapattinam district for this kharif season 2019-20. In Tiruvarur, 210 centres and in Thanjavur 52 centres were opened. Around 139 more centres would be opened on January 20 in Nagapattinam. Around 150 centres would be established in Thanjavur also, sources said.

Meanwhile, farmers have appealed that to avert irregularities in DPCs, the state government should resume the earlier practice of mobile purchase - procuring paddy from the farmer's field itself.

Along with the centres, the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) should also begin procuring paddy in the field itself. It would help the farmers to avoid transportation cost. Farmers said that when they approach DPCs, they are forced to wait for days till their turns come. Sometimes, grains may get wet if it would rain, the secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, Swamimalai S Vimalnathan said.

HYDERABAD: The Telangana Civil Supplies Corporation has procured a record 44 lakh metric tonnes of paddy this kharif, the highest in the history of the state.

Arrangements have been made to procure another 2 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from farmers, which would take the total to 46 lakh metric tonnes paddy production in kharif season.

The state government has given a counter guarantee to the corporation to obtain loans for procurement of paddy. The corporation needed more money this time due to bumper paddy crop, which was a result of multiple factors such as good rains, state government pro-farmer schemes such as Rs 10,000 per acre crop input subsidy, round-the-clock power supply and water availability from irrigation projects.

In the last kharif season, the Civil Supplies Corporation had purchased 40.41 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from 8 lakh farmers through 3,297 paddy purchase centres (PPCs).

In the kharifseason so far, 44 lakh metric tonnes paddy has been procured from over 8 lakh farmers through 3,669 PPCs with direct deposits into their bank accounts totallingRs 7,830 crore.

Civil Supplies Corporation Chairman Mareddy Srinivas Reddy said upgradation of Online Procurement Management System (OPMS) software has helped them in curbing middlemen exploiting the farmers.

“Payments are being made directly into the bank accounts of the farmers without any delay. From 2016-17 to 2019-20, over 45 lakh farmers have been paid Rs 37,000 crore in all through their bank accounts,” he said.

The ambulance with the organs left Nashik’s Rishikesh Hospital, along Gangapur Road, at 4.24 pm

NASHIK: The bereaved family of Milan Mohan Sharma , a 37-year-old brain-dead patient, agreed to donate his organs to give a fresh lease of life to transplant patients waiting for liver, kidneys, eyes and skin.

A kidney was rushed to Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital and the liver to Jupiter Hospital in Pune, through a 250km green corridor created between Nashik and Pune on Saturday.

The ambulance with the organs left Nashik’s Rishikesh Hospital, along Gangapur Road, at 4.24 pm.

The donor, a native of Dhulabari in Nepal, had been residing in Nashik with his wife and children for the past seven years. His family friends said that he met with an accident while riding a bike on January 10. Sharma was immediately taken to a private hospital in the city and later shifted to Rishikesh hospital. After several tests, the patient was declared brain dead. Sharma is survived by his wife, parents, two children aged 10 and 5 years. He worked as a cook in a restaurant in Nandur Naka area of the city.

Director of Rishikesh hospital Bhausaheb More and Sanjay Rakibe informed the patient’s wife and father that the patient had become brain dead, and if his organs are donated they can give life to seven other patients. The doctors said that the family agreed to donate the organs.

Senior doctors of Rishikesh Hospital said that soon after the patient was declared brain dead, the information was passed on to the Zonal Transplant Co-ordination Centre. Subsequently, the places when the organs would be sent were picked. One kidney was transplanted to a patient at the Rishikesh hospital itself. Meanwhile, the eyes and the skin have been sent to city-based eye and skin banks.

The ambulance carrying the organs left Rishikesh hospital at 4.24 pm. The Nashik police said that they would escort the ambulance till Chincholi Phata via Old Gangapur Naka, City Traffic Branch (Signal), Chandak Circle, Mumbai Naka, Dwarka and Nashik Road.

250,['19/01/2020'],Single agency for inline baggage screening at Kolkata airport,"Baggage screeners undergo training on inline X-ray

KOLKATA: The airport operator in Kolkata has taken control of screening of checked-in baggage for international flights and will soon take over the operation in the domestic wing as well once the inline X-Ray baggage inspection system (XBIS) is operational.Till recently, security team of state-owned airline Air India screened the registered baggage of passengers boarding flights of international carriers while Indian carriers do the screening for their passengers in both international and domestic wing.AAI Cargo Logistics & Allied Services Co Ltd (AAICLAS) has already recruited 87 screeners and the first batch has already been deployed after training at standalone X-Ray portals to screen passenger bags at the international airport.“At airports that are equipped with Inline XBIS, screening of check-in baggages is the responsibility of the airport operator. Technically, the scanning of check-in baggages through inline system has to be operated by a single agency. AAI has therefore made arrangements by providing screeners through AAICLAS. Once inline XBIS is operational at the airport next month, AAICLS will take over the entire check-in baggage screening operation in Kolkata,” an official at Kolkata airport said.Once inline XBIS is operational, passengers will no longer have to stand at a separate queue to get their checked-in bag screened before depositing them at the check-in counters. This often leads to an additional 15-30 minutes in queue before reporting at the check-in desk that closes 45 minutes before a flight departure.Inline XBIS will usher in a radical change in security and efficiency with four-levels of scanning bags. Since the throughput of inline scanning is much higher than the standalone portals, experienced screeners taken by AAICLAS from the security teams of various airlines are undergoing retraining. Some of them have already been certified by Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) screeners.The cargo at domestic and international cargo terminals that is scanned by respective airlines will also be taken over by AAICLAS shortly.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73371406,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-183679,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/single-agency-for-inline-baggage-screening-at-kolkata-airport/articleshow/73363168.cms

KOLKATA/MIDNAPORE: The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) has penalized CMRI to the tune of Rs 5 lakh for lapses in treatment of a patient. Since the patient withdrew his complaint, the penalty amount will be given to two NGOs.

The complainant, who had undergone treatment at the hospital, had initially lodged a complaint about a wrong summary that was handed to him at the time of release. During follow-up, doctors found that the discharge summary had a medication that was supposed to be taken only during hospitalisation. But he had taken the medication at home. Though the drug did not cause any adverse effect, the patient lodged a complaint with WBCERC. “We have received the order,” said a hospital spokesperson.

In another case, WBCERC on January 15 ordered Spandan Nursing Home in Midnapore to pay Rs 10 lakh compensation for allegedly trying to administer expired injection to a patient — Probodh Chandra Dey.

Spandan director Partha Mondal said, “It’s wrong to store expired medicines. We have explained our side to the commission. The compensation will be paid in February.”

252,['19/01/2020'],NGO finds city tank is home to 45 common birds this season,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Madurai: A two-day bird-watching exercise undertaken at the Semattankulam tank in Thirunagar by NGO Oorvanam, revealed the presence of 45 common species.

Co-founder of the organisation P R Vishwanath said that they usually undertake this local bird-watching drive among the members of their group, and try to identify the birds in their location. “We decided to do it on Pongal day, and were able to sight 45 common birds, and not many foreign migratory birds,” he said.

Some of the birds that were sighted included the Little Grebe, Indian spot-billed duck, Little Cormorant, Indian Pond Heron, Black Crowned Night Heron, Purple Heron, Little Egret, Glossy Ibis, Common coot, moorhen, white breasted waterhen, white-browed wagtail, yellow wagtail. Many birds that the locals consider uncommon like the spotted owlet, Blue faced malkoha, honey buzzard, Asian koel, Shikra were also sighted.

The Semattankulam tank, spread over an 80-acre area, is more of a sewage dump than a clean water tank, but still birds are found near it, sending out a message that water bodies are very important for the birds. “There is garbage, sewage and weeds in the tank, but still the birds continue to exist around it,” he said.

Vishwanath, Samson Kirubakaran and Srinivasan, who were part of the exercise said that they had to spend about 15 minutes at one particular site to spot a bird. They then took photographs and uploaded all details obtained by them on the eBird India app. They said they try to look for nests, eggs, fledglings and upload the exact number of birds they sighted. For instance, if they spot a mother duck and a duckling, the count of ducks is two.

These bird-watchers say that the availability of water in the tank cannot be a reason for the fairly good bird count, as the tank always holds sewage if not good water. But, they had not spot any house sparrows, or pelicans like they had did last year.

This year, a bird watch and a count is being done throughout Tamil Nadu between January 16 and 19, they added.

Bird-watching is a learning experience for students. Parents should encourage their children to learn about the local birds, which can be done even by sitting on one’s terrace, said Vishwanath.

TimesView This is a step in the right direction. It will be beneficial for both business and the clientele.

KOLKATA: Dozens of budget hotels with only one restaurant-cum-bar have resumed serving breakfast to guests at the restaurant after nearly 14 months.“Since the excise department notification in September 2018 that barred restaurants with bars from even serving food beyond hours when liquor sales is permitted, we have been serving breakfast to guests at their room. It is only after the department revised the notification on January 14 that we have been able to open our restaurant during breakfast hours again,” said T S Walia, owner of Walson Hotel on Sudder Street. All this while, the hotels had been forced to stop the buffet spread at breakfast and instead offered limited choice that guests could order in their rooms.Beyond breakfast, even dinners will no longer be a hurried affair at restaurants across the city that have bar licence. Hotel & Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) secretary Suresh Poddar said the earlier regulation was embarrassing as guests had to be forced out by the Cinderella hour. HRAEI president Pranav Singh is optimistic that the relaxation will lead to a 5%-8% jump in revenue from food that had taken a 30% hit in the past year.“Not just during festive days, even on Fridays and Saturdays, we had to clear the tables by midnight. That means taking the last order at 11.15pm. If a restaurant with a bar licence wanted to just serve food beyond midnight, it had to take an hour's extension for Rs 10,000. That did not make business sense as you need to make Rs 30,000 during those 60 minutes to make a profit. We are glad the new excise commissioner, Khalid Aziz Anwar, acted on the matter less than a week after we submitted a representation seeking a rule change,” said Poddar.The rule change will also mean a huge breather to banquets where liquor was served. “Earlier, all banquets attached to a place that served liquor had to shut at midnight.

PANAJI: Aruna Wagh, widow of former deputy speaker Vishnu Wagh , has moved the high court of Bombay at Goa seeking that family pension be granted to her and her two children aged 12 and 16 years. In her petition, she has stated that she received little respite despite multiple letters to the government.

In August last year, the directorate of accounts had informed her that the grant of family pension to her could not be considered under provisions of the Goa, Salary, Allowance and Pension of Members of the Legislative Assembly, Act, 2004, because she serves as education officer at the central government’s National Board for Workers Education and Development, and is drawing a salary. Two months later, in October, Aruna received a letter which stated that due to a legal issue, the matter had been referred to the law department for an opinion.

Aruna, in her petition, has stated that the intimation by the directorate of accounts did not take into consideration the special and constitutional status granted to the speakers of the state. She has further said that nowhere is it laid down that for grant of family pension to a widow/widower, either of the spouses is precluded/debarred from the receipt of family pension for drawing separate income or being employed in a central/state government organisation or otherwise.

The rejection of pension is not in good faith and taste, she said.

NMC officials to take up anti-encroachment drives across Nashik

NASHIK: Standing committee chairman Uddhav Nimse has ordered the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials to take up anti-encroachment drives across the city as the earliest.

Nimse, on Saturday, conducted the standing committee meeting in which the members raised the issue of encroachments on the streets across the city. Nimse said the NMC authorities need to ensure pedestrians’ as well as motorists’ safety.

“The issues of roadside encroachments and vendors not shifting to the vegetable market constructed at the various places are very serious. The administration needs to take strict measures to ensure the safety of people. The roadside fish and vegetable markets are choking the roads,” Nimse said.

The issues were raised by Kalpana Pande and Himgauri Aher-Adke. Talking about encroachment at Shivaji Chowk near Lekha Nagar, Kalpana Pande said the vendors who come to sell their products at the vegetable market were not only encroaching the road but also threatening the people around.

“About two years ago, these vendors were limited only to the open space near the constructed market. But now, they are slowly acquiring the surrounding areas and even entering the lanes and bylanes making it difficult for commuters. This is putting the lives of citizens who come there to buy vegetables at risk,” Pande alleged. She claimed that all these were illegal vendors, and they were able to ply their businesses only because of strong support from some NMC officials.

Himgauri Aher-Adke, meanwhile, pointed out that the vegetable vendors near the Akashwani towers were adamantly refused to shift to the vegetable market constructed there. “In order to ensure the safety of people and manage the market, the NMC has constructed a market place. But the vendors refuse to budge. The NMC officials do not seem to be taking action against people illegally encroaching on the road,” Aher-Adke, a member of the standing committee, said.

It was the same story in other areas including Nashik Road, Pathardi Phata, Satpur, where the fish and meat vendors occupy space along the sides of the roads creating problems for the motorists.

Summing up the discussions, Nimse asked deputy commissioner Rahul Patil to take strict action against the officers/employees from the anti-encroachment the department, dismiss them from the service if they are found to be engaged in corrupt practices and ensure that all roads and even streets are encroachment-free at the earliest.

KOLKATA: Applications for obtaining birth certificates from the Kolkata Municipal Corporation offices have registered a 50% surge in the recent times, amid fears of being left out of the NRC list after CAA was notified. So much so that a section of the KMC health department employees in the borough level has been spendi ng extra hours at work, catering to the huge demand. But Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim clearly stated that there was no need for panic as the chief minister had said the state government would not allow NRC to be implemented in Bengal and that no person here would be asked to leave.Congress councillor Prakash Upadhyay and his Trinamool counterpart Ratna Sur on Saturday pointed out at the KMC monthly meeting how fear had led to an unprecedented rush for obtaining birth certificates and demanded that Hakim addressed the issue.While Upadhyay wanted the mayor to come clear on the state government and civic body’s official stand on NRC, Sur urged Hakim to allay the fears of citizens, who had been scrambling to get their documents ready for the NRC. Upadhyay complained that he was under pressure from a particular community in his ward to help them get identity-proof documents—be it birth certificates, ration cards or residential certificates. “People in large numbers approach me almost every day, expressing their fears about the NRC. These people are in search of either birth certificates, ration cards or certificates proving they are residents of the city, and so, India. They want me to clear the air about the NRC issue. How do I tell them that the issue is out of my bounds?” Upadhyay said on Saturday.Sur also expressed helplessness that she was being approached by people in large numbers who were anxious about the NRC and wanted to get documents, like Aadhaar cards, voter cards, birth certificates and ration cards, to ensure they were not left out of the citizenship list.Giving a patient hearing to the councillors’ grievances, Hakim said there was no need for panic. “Our CM has categorically said that the state government won’t allow NRC in Bengal. So, there is no need for citizens to panic. There is no power that can dislodge our citizens, on the pretext of implementing NRC,” he said amid applause in the KMC House. Later, he told reporters the ruling party councillors were told to clear all doubts about NRC in their respective wards. “We have nothing to hide. So, the councillors must take the initiative to address the issue and spread awareness among residents of their respective wards about our stand on the NRC. No forces can compel us to implement NRC in Bengal,” the mayor said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73366660,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-127902,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-nrc-in-bengal-says-hakim-as-birth-cert-demand-surges-50/articleshow/73363211.cms

Kolkata: A nine-year-old boy had a close shave and a 52-year-old woman got trapped after a fire broke out at a house on Dover Road on Saturday. While none was injured, the bedroom, kitchen and bathroom on the first floor of the house were damaged. It took two hours for three fire tenders to douse the flames.

Nirvaan Chatterjee was studying inside his room on the first floor of the two-storey house around 6.20pm when he smelt something was burning. As Nirvaan came out of the room, he found flames inside the kitchen and bedroom. He locked the door which separates that portion of the building from the rest of the house and alerted his grandparents living on the same floor. He also helped them come out of the building.

“We were outside when the fire broke out. My aunt Dolly Banerjee, who was trapped in smoke, rushed to the terrace,” recounted Rathijit Chatterjee, Nirvaan’s father. She could finally come down using the fire brigade’s ladder.

The call to fire brigade went from the Jaiswal house a few metres away. Ritu Jaiswal, a resident, spotted the fire and called the fire brigade.

“Since the entry towards our house is through a narrow lane, they opened the gate of their house to allow fire tenders to get inside,” Chatterjee said. Cars parked inside the house of Jaiswals — owners of a prominent hotel in central Kolkata — were also taken out. The fire was brought under control by 8.30pm.

“It seems the fire had started from the bedroom,” Chatterjee said.

Chhagan Bhujbal

NASHIK: District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal on Saturday criticized his predecessor for not paying attention to the district’s progress, without directly naming Girish Mahajan .

After the district planning committee (DPC) meeting, Bhujbal also pulled up government officials for shoddy performance as the agencies had spent only 23% of the general plan of Rs 346 crore for 2019-20 till mid-January 2020.

“I would not like to comment on (predecessors), but the slow pace of developmental works clearly points to the fact that there was something missing. Elected representatives have to monitor the developmental works. That is the reason I am here,” Bhujbal said when he was asked if there was laxity on part of the former district guardian minister Girish Mahajan in steering the developmental works here.

Bhujbal said he would call the DPC on January 28 again and warned the officers that if there was no significant change in their attitude, they would face the music. “If you cannot work in this district, go to some other place where the situation is better,” he told the officials.

On the queries related to the MahaMetro for the city, Bhujbal said he would first focus on the ongoing works. “I will look into Metro and other projects at a later stage after getting in-depth information. Right now, my priority is getting works in the pipeline cleared,” he said.

Earlier, Bhujbal, who is also the state food and civic supplies and consumer affairs minister pulled up the officials of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited and zilla parishad for not responding to the queries of the elected representatives.

After establishing a strong presence in manufacturing ceramic tiles, Asian Granito started making sanitaryware products a few months ago and recently forayed into manufacturing of bathware products like faucets, showers and other accessories. With this, the home-grown tile and home décor company has become a complete bathroom solution provider.

""For creating an international brand, one needs to have an entire range of bathroom products. Leading players in the ceramic space have done this. We want AGL Bathware to become Rs 150 crore to Rs 200 crore brand in the next 4-5 years,"" said Kamlesh Patel, CMD, Asian Granito India Ltd (AGL).

The company has registered a turnover of Rs 1,187 crore in two decades and now seeks to achieve a revenue target of Rs 2,000 crore over the next two to three years.

""Way back in 1994, along with my elder brother Mukeshbhai , I started making tiles at a small plant in Idar near Himmatnagar. We chose this place because of its proximity to Rajasthan where raw materials were easily available,"" recalls the 49-year-old first generation entrepreneur.

Later, Patel sold the first plant and established AGL in 2000, a bigger facility with a production capacity of 2,500 square meters per day. Today, the company’s tile production capacity has increased to 1 lakh square meters per day. The company is ranked among top-4 ceramic tiles companies in India.

Hailing from a middle-class family in Himmatnagar, Patel embarked on his business journey soon after his graduation in commerce. His mother Hiraben motivated him to start his entrepreneurial venture, which now employs 6,000 people, including contractual labourers.

""We aim to adopt an asset light business model by focusing on outsourcing manufacturing of tiles and low-value products. The emphasis will be on building our brand,"" Patel said.

The company currently has 10 state-of-the-art manufacturing units spread across Gujarat and over 300 exclusive showrooms, 13 display centres across India. ""AGL currently exports to 69 countries and we hope to reach 100 countries in two years,"" Patel added.

AGL is also a leader in organised Quartz market in India. The company is further expanding Quartz products manufacturing capacity by setting up a new 800 square meter facility. Quartz is a premium product and 80-90% production is exported to USA, Europe, Australia and other developed markets.

The company has approved to raise Rs. 87 crore through warrants issue. The proceeds will be used for expansion, debt reduction, working capital requirement and improving capital structure. AGL has received the first installment towards the warrants issue.

KOLKATA: The new GM of Kolkata Metro on Saturday inspected East-West Metro’s 5km Salt Lake section. Sources said efforts are on to unveil Kolkata’s Line 2, whose truncated launch has been long overdue, by January-end.Manoj Joshi has just taken charge as GM, Metro Railway. On Saturday, he did an extensive survey of the ready-to-launch East-West Metro, boarding one of the futuristic BEML rake at 10am from Sector V station. He also did a recce of the underground section, riding till the Phoolbagan crossover. The East-West tracks run along an elevated viaduct starting at Sector V till Salt Lake Stadium along EM Bypass. The tracks duck at Subhas Sarovar where the underground tunnelling starts. Joshi covered around 6km to check the Phoolbagan station, which is the first underground station of the 16.5km East-West Metro. He then visited the state-of-the-art Salt Lake depot where the section’s nucleus or the operations control cabin (OCC) is housed, along with the stabling yard.Even as Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC) is implementing the Rs 8,575-crore East-West Metro, which will be India’s first underwater Metro project, Metro Railway, which runs Kolkata’s north-south line, will be in charge of its operations. Around 100 employees of Metro Railway are undergoing rigorous training so that they can seamlessly operate the advanced East-West corridor.Since October 2018, the Salt Lake launch has been missing one deadline after another. On August 31 last year, the project was hit by the biggest mishap ever as the machine boring one of the underground tunnels at Bowbazar hit an aquifer that caused large-scale subsidence resulting in buildings falling like a pack of cards.The new GM’s inspection is likely to pave the way for the much-awaited launch, an official said. “He was very positive about launching the section, happy with the readiness,” said the official. He said the GM was likely to give his report on the preparedness to Railway Board, which, in turn, would inform CRS about a possible date of commissioning.

HYDERABAD: Propelled by the rush of big-ticket IT/ITeS companies, Hyderabad’s office space absorption touched 10.50 million square feet (sft) in 2019 – only marginally behind Bengaluru. Until 2014-15, the city’s annual score wasn’t more than 3.5 to 4 million sft.Among the players that contributed to this highest-ever absorption are: Facebook, Qualcomm, Intel, Dell, Xilinx, Synchrony along with significant co-working entities like CoWrks, WeWork, Simpliworks, Tablespace and Redbrick, show JLL’s India Real Estate Market Update 2019 (office).“Gachibowli surpassed the space take-up in Hi-Tec City contributing to more than 65% of the net absorption,” the report stated terming 2019, as a “benchmark year” for Hyderabad as it hit another new high – completion of new projects covering 13.25 million sft.Not surprising then, office rentals in the city shot up during the last year, with the average hovering around Rs 56.17 per sft. Rents at many Grade A spaces were revised upwards to Rs 75-Rs 80 per sft.“Given the trend, I am confident Hyderabad will overtake Bengaluru in the next one or two years in annual office space absorption,” said Sandip Patnaik, managing director, JLL (Telangana and Andhra Pradesh), on the sidelines of Saturday’s event.“It’s real a turnaround story for the city of Hyderabad. This proves what good governance can do,” he added attributing it multiple reasons including stable government, friendly corporate policies, availability of quality office supply, among others. The presence of a sizeable talent pool and relatively lower rentals – in comparison to Bengaluru, Gurgaon, Pune and Mumbai -- are also important factors, Patnaik said.While Bengaluru’s average rentals are pegged at Rs 74.38 per sft per month, it is around Rs 77.80 per sft in Delhi NCR and Rs 68.31 per sft in Pune, as per the report.The momentum in office space is expected to rise further in 2020 with more than 13 million sft expected to be completed this year, the JLL report added.Speaking about Hyderabad’s growth in the office space category as well as being recognised as the most dynamic city in the world, Ramesh Nair, CEO and country head (India), JLL said, “ The state government’s focus on business friendly policies and provision of high quality infrastructure has given Hyderabad a competitive edge.""",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73370959,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-457138,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-high-for-hyd-office-space-absorption-rises-to-10-million-sft/articleshow/73363256.cms

Panaji: Credai-Goa welcomed the state government’s decision to withdraw a contentious circular , which had made it mandatory to approach the block development officers for construction licences and occupancy certificates.

A delegation from Credai had met with panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho with concerns about the impact that the new procedure would have on the real estate sector.

“Almost all new constructions would have come to a stop. There were projects which were nearly complete and it would have been impossible to obtain completion certificates in time which would have delayed the handover of flats,” said Credai president Nilesh Salkar.

The panchayat department circular, dated January 7, had stated that residential projects with more than 200 sqm have to submit applications for construction licences and occupancy certificates to the block development officers instead of the local village panchayat.

Real estate developers said the department’s circulars would have delayed the issuance of construction licences and occupancy certificate and would have hurt an already lacklustre market for residential units.

“We welcome and support the minister in this decision. This will bring cheer to the real estate. The members are content that the government is taking several initiatives for the real estate industry, which is otherwise reeling under the economic slowdown,” he said.

Kolkata: Mohammad Sanaullah, a decorated Indian soldier, was serving in Manipur as a part of Operation Hifazat, a counter insurgency operation, when the Assam Border Police prepared a report, declaring him a foreigner in 2008. This, in spite of him furnishing records that he had served in the Indian Army for 30 years, recounted Sanaullah’s lawyer Aman Wadud at a workshop held in the city on Sunday to educate people about the nuances of CAA and NRC .

Wadud, a human rights activist from Guawahati, pointed out how thousands of families were rendered without home, dignity and identity, merely at the click of a mouse. Case in point, he said, was Suren Biswas, who did not make it to the NRC, because his name was erroneously spelt ‘Surendra’ in one of his documents. Notices were sent to his family, declaring them all, including wife and children, foreigners.

Several such cases of people being left out of the NRC list in Assam were pointed out at the capacity-building workshop, organized by NGO Know Your Neighbour, which works on strengthening bonds among citizens. Jhuma Sen , assistant professor and assistant director at Centre for Human Rights Studies, Jindal Global Law School, said the new citizenship law discriminated against people on the basis of their religions, and that the proposed NPR and NRC would affect many. Stating that several myths were being peddled by CAA and NRC supporters to misguide people, Sen said, “The Centre is telling us CAA, NRC and NPR are not linked, and that NPR is like a census. They are claiming NPR and NRC are unrelated. But NPR is actually a pre-condition for NRC. Amendment to the Citizenship Act in 2003 states local register of Indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification from the population register.” The combination of CAA and NRC would help the government shift the goal post for a particular community, she said.

Several people in the audience asked about their constitutional rights and how the combination of CAA and NRC threatened their citizenship. The CAA provided for citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Parsi from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who sought refuge in India before 2015 but left out Muslims from those countries. The NRC would require every India to prove his/her citizenship, failing which, they might be declared illegal migrants. The CAA and NRC together is feared to filter out many, mostly, Muslims.

“No guidelines were followed while preparing NRC. Officers randomly sent notices to poor people to prove their citizenship. Many of them sold their homes and cattle to travel to the foreign tribunals and pay lawyers. Those failing to make it were declared foreigners ex parte. Bona fide citizens were dragged to detention camps because their names were erroneously spelt. Many spent more than a decade in detention camps, but it could not be proved that they were illegal immigrants,” said Wadud.

Panaji: The Goa Tourism Development Corporation’s (GTDC) special purpose vehicle (SPV) that was formed in 2012 with an objective to develop tourism infrastructure, took up projects involving the repair and refurbishment of temples and churches over the past few years that were not even remotely linked to tourism. This is set to change as the corporation will now be compelled to exercise restraint while approving such projects.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant, who heads the high-powered committee for tourism development, questioned officials over the matter at the last meeting after it was pointed out that GTDC has been utilising its funds to beautify temples and churches.

“The chief minister made it clear that neither he nor his office has made any requests for beautification of either churches or temples, and that such works should not be undertaken unless those places are visited by tourists,” a member of the committee said.

Some projects that got a nod in the past were proposed by tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar for his constituency of Pernem. Quite a few projects were taken up in Curchorem, too, which is represented by power minister Nilesh Cabral. Cabral served as GTDC chairman from 2012 to September 2018.

Of the 28 projects for Pernem taluka that were listed to be taken up on priority, 25 pertained to beautification and illumination of temples, while one or two comprised the upgrading of a church and chapel. The total estimated cost for these was Rs 60 crore.

Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) president Savio Messias said the association did not have any objection to tourism funds being used for the renovation of a church or temple if it is visited by tourists. “Some of the temples are in the remotest areas, which should not have even been considered,” he said.

Tourism secretary J Ashok Kumar said the government was trying to restrict GTDC’s expenses towards temples and churches and that not all proposals are approved.

Another official said that as GTDC was faced with a funds crunch, it should not develop and illuminate every temple or church even if proposals are made by the elected representatives concerned.

Trichy: Strongly criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah over the citizenship amendment act (CAA), former judge of Madras high court K Chandru has said that people now have a clear understanding about the Constitution of India which posed a serious challenge to the BJP government.

“Modi and Shah have to face the challenges because people who gave them the Constitution have now taken it on their hand and are protesting against CAA,” said Chandru at a programme organised by an organisation called Vaanam here on Saturday. Speaking on “challenges being faced by the Constitution”, the former judge accused Modi and Shah of working on an agenda to create hindutva rule. “Constitution clearly says those born in India, born to the parents born in India are Indian citizens. In the name of national register of citizens (NRC), they are going to waste public money,” he said.

On the protests in Assam over CAA, Chandru said it had a different angle as they opposed the BJP government’s move to include 12 lakh Hindus from the 19 lakh people including Muslims who were excluded from the national register of citizens. The former judge recalled B R Ambedkar cautioning about the need for economic and social independence after getting the country got political independence.

Recalling a threat to a woman who protested against CAA during Amit Shah’s visit in Delhi recently, Chandru said they were hell-bent on creating a situation where there should be no dissent to whatever they were doing. Chandru also criticised the AIADMK-led government in Tamil Nadu for being ‘submissive’ to the BJP government at the Centre and supporting CAA. “Kerala moved the Supreme court against CAA. We cannot expect that in Tamil Nadu because of the submissive government here,” he said. Justice Chandru also spoke on Judiciary and Networking at the 9th Jesuit Alumni National Congress at St Joseph’s college campus in the morning.

In addition, Rs 95.83 crore will be spent on providing services to various communities and social groups after taking the demands into consideration.

The committee has planned to spend some funds for the construction of classrooms of zilla parishad schools, given the fact that there are no funds to carry out repair work of these schools.

The government allocates funds for the construction of the schools, but, in cases of additional classrooms or construction of new classrooms, lack of funds creates a roadblock. It is estimated that the move will help to construct at least 70 classrooms in rural areas of the district.

The district has sought special permission from the government to facilitate funds for the construction of classrooms in ZP schools.

In the non-core sector, the administration plans to spend Rs 74 crore on the construction of roads across the district. The task is typically undertaken by the zilla parishad.

The planning committee takes into consideration the demands of various government agencies, compiles them and then forwards it to the state government for approval.

In the year 2019-20, the district had received Rs 346 crore from the state government under the general plan. This year, the committee has placed the demand of Rs 348.86 crore. “We have the demanded Rs 80 crore more and the same shall be considered during the state-level meeting scheduled with finance minister Ajit Pawar on January 31,” a senior officer from the district administration said.

Madurai: The Nellaiappar temple in Tirunelveli is to be the first temple in the state to receive Blissful Hygiene Offering to God (BHOG), a quality certification given by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for all food items offered in temples.

The certification was introduced by the state food safety and drug administration (FSDA) to ensure that the prasadam distributed to devotees in temples after being offered to the deity and also that sold in the stalls conform to FSSAI standards.

The FSDA had asked the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) department to comply with the rules. A meeting to this effect presided by Tirunelveli district collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish and officials of the administration was held recently.

It was informed that the prasadam provided by the Nellaiappar temple had been certified most hygienic and clean and that the certification would be given away at the Republic Day celebrations.

The Sankaranarayanar temple in Sankarankoil in the district has bagged the second spot among the major temples in the state in obtaining the certification. Temple executive officer N Yagna Narayanan said the certification had been implemented as a pilot project in the Nellaiappar and Sankaranarayanar temples.

As they had fulfilled the norms of the certification, they were also certified as BHOG quality standard temple.

The temple’s prasadam is boiled rice, but they also offered pongal and puliyodarai if the devotees wanted to make the offering. The annadhanam offered in the temple was also certified under this process.

Madurai: A dispute over the recently concluded rural local body elections resulted in the death of a 55-year-old man in Uthapuram near Usilampatti in Madurai district on Saturday evening.

The deceased has been identified as N Muthiah, leader of the Pillaimar uravinmurai association in Uthapuram village. Muthiah was allegedly beaten to death by Balraj, 58, his neighbour and his family members demanding Rs 15,000, which they had given him to make Balraj win the election, which he eventually lost.

According to police sources, Balraj contested for the post of Uthapuram panchayat president. Muthiah roped in Murugesan from the same community as a dummy candidate. Balraj approached Muthiah and gave him Rs 15,000 to help him win the election by convincing Murugesan to withdraw his nomination. He feared that caste vote would get divided if two people from same community contested in the village, where pillaimars are outnumbered by the scheduled caste community members.

However, Murugesan did not withdraw his candidature and Balraj lost the election to Murugan from the gounder community. Since then, Balraj and his family members have been accusing Muthiah for not working hard enough. They picked up a quarrel with him on Friday demanding the Rs 15,000 back. While he left the place after assuring to return the money, they picked up a quarrel with him again on Saturday and beat him to death.

HYDERABAD: Industries minister KT Rama Rao invited Thailand to invest in the proposed Furniture Park to be established in the state. He made the remarks while addressing a 100-member Thai delegation seeking trade opportunities in the city.

Speaking about the state’s commitment to provide housing for all, KTR said, “Thai companies can set up their units at the Furniture Park that is to come up in and around the city.” He said the state government could even enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Commerce, Thailand, in this regard.

“A Thai base in the city can be used to cover the rest of India. This is a great opportunity as India will continue to focus on construction, as pointed out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the next few years,” said KTR.

“The nearest seaport from Hyderabad is about 400 km. We can talk about transport subsidies and setting up of inland depots,” he added.

The ‘India-Thailand Business Matching and Networking’ meet, focused on business opportunities arising particularly out of Thai rubber wood.

KTR said food processing could be another area of cooperation. “Surplus water will be a reality for Telangana farmers in a couple of years. Once this happens, there will be tremendous opportunity in food processing and agro industries,” he said.

With the two countries being major tourism destinations, the minister also spoke of possibility of increased air connectivity between Telangana and Thailand.

The visiting delegation was led by Thailand Deputy Prime Minister Jurin Laksanawisit, who also stressed on ‘environment-friendly’ products. “Rubber wood that Thailand seeks to export is farmed wood and not that taken from forests,” he said.

Laksanawisit said trade opportunities would also be explored in tapioca, automobile parts, food and processed food, paper, chemicals, construction materials, electronics, apparel and cosmetics among other products.

Women protesters at Shaheen Bagh implored the PM to visit their small neighbourhood

NEW DELHI: Most of the women who have been staging a sit-in at Shaheen Bagh for the last 34 days against the new citizenship law , had a common proposal on Saturday. They wanted a dialogue with the PM .

“We invite the Prime Minister of India to Shaheen Bagh to join us for tea, witness our resolve and listen to our concerns,” read a poster.

Around 5.30pm, the volunteers distributed blank postcards to nearly a thousand women. Half an hour later the postcards were returned with heartfelt pleas for dialogue and messages expressing anguish and determination.

One of the volunteers told TOI that they had collected over 20,000 postcards from across Delhi, and would be sending them to the PM’s official residence on Monday. The hashtag Modiji Shaheen Bagh kab aaoge trended on Twitter through the day with 81,000 tweets around 9pm.

“Hausla hai bahot mujhme, par ye lazim toh nahin ki harr baar aakhri hadh tak aazmayi jaun (I have abundant courage, but that does not mean I should be put to test to the maximum extent every time),” read one of the postcards, while referring to the intense cold conditions that the women have braved to register their protest against Citizenship Amendment Act.

The protesters wrote in English, Hindi and Urdu, imploring the PM to visit their neighbourhood for “Chai pe Charcha” so that he could listen to their “mann ki baat”. “We voted for this government because they assured us that there would be development for all. But now our citizenship is being questioned,” said Salma, who was there with her 7-month-old son.

Another protester added: “We supported this government when they abolished triple talaq. The PM said he cared about his sisters. So why are we being treated like his now? This law is discriminatory.”

The day had begun with ‘Burai ke khilaf bunai,’ and the women sat together with needles and colourful yarns to knit scarves with messages like secularism, no to CAA and no to NRC sewn on them. “You may break the country, we will knit it back,” read an accompanying message with the poster announcing the initiative.

The same message of building and leading the country was echoed by actor Sushant Singh, who came to the neighbourhood around 6.30pm. “Every part of the country now has a Shaheen Bagh. Our women and children are leading this country. We will follow you no matter what,” said Singh.

Panaji: Kickstarting the process to set up the fourth solid waste treatment plant in the state, Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC) is scouting for an agency to help conduct a rapid environment impact assessment (EIA) study for the plant, which will come up on 1 lakh sqm of land at Verna .

Officials said the EIA will be submitted to the Goa State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (Goa-SEIAA) in order to obtain environmental clearance for the proposed facility.

GWMC said the agency must conduct the rapid EIA as per timelines specified by Goa-SEIAA. The last date for interested firms to submit bids is February 10, while the bids will be opened on February 12.

“The proposed facility will treat the municipal solid waste after recovering all possible recyclables and segregating them into the organic waste and inorganic waste. Biogas generated from wet, organic waste will be used to generate electricity,” a senior GWMC official said.

The waste management facility will be able to process 250 tonne of solid waste per day and 20% extra on peak days. The government has acquired 1 lakh sqm of land within Phase 4 of the Verna industrial estate located at survey number 160 and 161 of Loutolim.

GWMC has floated an e-tender seeking technical and financial bids from reputed consultants accredited by the Quality Council of India or National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET) to conduct the EIA and obtain the EC to construct the facility.

“The EIA has to be completed within six months, including the monsoon, from the date of execution of the contract,” officials said.

As part of the EIA, the selected agency will have to collect data in the project area as well as in the area within 5km of the proposed project site. An inventory of all the flora and fauna along with water bodies and groundwater will have to be collected for one season apart from the monsoon, officials said.

The candidates had to fulfil the basic criteria of being below 55 years of age and having at least 15 years of experience as an assistant professor. They must also not have any police cases registered against their name. Two of the 20 shortlisted candidates are only provisionally shortlisted as they have cases pending against them.

PALANPUR: Despite intensive ‘save the bird ’ campaigns prior to Uttarayan , killer manja continues to prey on birds each year. Activists fear that the number of fatalities has increased every passing year.

After 64 birds were killed this Uttarayan in Patan, an NGO along with bird lovers came up with a novel method to spread social awareness on saving birds. They organized an elaborate funeral procession for the birds killed by the Chinese manja, on Friday.

“Let this be an eye-opener for all people that birds, like humans, have a right to life,” said Viren Shah, convener of local Jivdaya Charitable Trust (JCT), an animal welfare NGO that organized the unique bird funeral.

“We call ourselves civilized, but our insensitivity takes us back to the dark ages. We do not think twice about inflicting meaningless destruction on the avian species, either killing them for our fun or leaving them maimed for life. The strings are intentionally made sharp which proves not only dangerous for the birds but humans too. Sadly bird death does not create news, human deaths make headlines,"" Shah added.

“The sky truly belongs to the birds for its survival. What we humans have done is turn the blue yonder into their graveyard with our cruel intentions. Despite ban, why is the government so lax on killer manja?” asked Dr Mayank Shah, a well-known physician and bird lover.

Her parents have taken care to see that she is shielded from any inquires and questions that remind her of what happened seven years ago. They have shifted home numerous times to avoid any attention from neighbours or curious people.The girl’s uncle, who was at Karkadooma court on Saturday, disclosed, “When the family was living in Gandhi Nagar in east Delhi, people would talk about the incident whenever police came or when political leaders visited their house. What was important for the parents was to ensure the girl was not forced to recall the incident or be treated like a victim.” The uncle has attended all the court hearings, even on days when the father was unable to.The girl, who bears surgery marks on her stomach, has been told these were due to an injury. The father said, “My daughter does not have a clear memory of it. We do not discuss the incident at home or talk about it with anyone else. When I have to engage in a conversation with the lawyers, I go outside to speak to them. Her mother sometimes worries that someone outside the family will tell her of her past.”Ever since the abominable episode, the family has lived a life of turmoil. There is fear in the minds of the parents and they don’t leave their children alone. “We have undergone pain and trauma. My wife take the trouble of herself dropping or picking up our children from school,” the father said. “If she has work then I go. We have requested the colony guard not to let them out if not accompanied by my wife or me.”On Saturday morning too, when the father informed the mother about the judgment to be delivered later that day, he asked her to fetch the kids from school. Both the siblings study in the same school, the girl in Class 5 and the boy in Class IV. There’s a difference of two years between the youngsters.Asked if his daughter has ever expressed a wish for the future, the father said, “Sometimes she says she wants to become a police officer, and at other times, a doctor.

“Virtual labs, an MHRD initiative, is an e-learning platform that provides students exposure to practical laboratory experiments. NIT Goa is a nodal centre of NITK Surathkal for the ‘virtual labs’ programme and through this, NIT Goa will open new avenues of experiential learning to the students and faculty members of the institution and the region as a whole,” he said, adding, “On January 23, we will host a workshop on virtual labs for representatives of all engineering institutes in Goa, to expose them also to this idea.”

Virtual labs is a programme under the ‘national mission on education through information and communication technology’, which aims at facilitating learning of engineering and sciences through experimentation in a virtual environment at the preferred pace, place and period of the learner, Mugeraya said.

In this mission of ICT-aided experimental learning, NITK Surathkal is among the 12 chosen institutes in the country and is engaged in the development, maintenance and outreach of the online resources under the virtual labs project.

“The virtual labs will come to the aid of undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD students of NIT Goa. The student fraternity of NIT Goa will be able to learn the remote experimentations of the state-of-the-art concepts with the help of the virtual laboratory set-up. Additionally, the faculty and students of NIT Goa will acquire virtual access to latest softwares and sophisticated hardware,” Mugeraya added.

Following the collaboration with NITK Surathkal, students and faculty of NIT Goa in due course of time may also be trained at NITK Surathkal campus, he said.

“NIT Goa will also have the opportunity to take up initiatives to contribute to the virtual labs project through pedagogy design, lab development and student internships, jointly with NITK Surathkal. NIT Goa is also hoping to take up workshops and other innovative initiatives and activities to spread the awareness about virtual labs to a larger audience internally and in rest of Goa,” Mugeraya said.

Maulana Azad National Urdu University

HYDERABAD: After the Students Union of Maulana Azad National Urdu University ( Manuu ) threatened to go on a hunger strike, the varsity administration decided to promote 87 detained students.

While the university rule mandates having at least 75% attendance to be allowed for semester exam, all these students have above 50% attendance. Union members claimed that the varsity did not consider medical and extracurricular relaxation before detaining students.

“The vice-chancellor agreed to promote all students. This is happening for the first time in Manuu’s history. Guidelines will be issued after academic council meeting on January 30,” said Umer Faruq, president, student union.

The students even posted this message along with the representation letter submitted on the student union page on a social networking site. The students submitted a representation on January 14, following which a decision was taken by the administration.

“We would like to draw your attention towards promotion of students detained due to shortage of attendance. The students who have above 50% attendance should be promoted,” read the representation submitted to the vice-chancellor by student union.

Trichy: A 32-year-old man was gored to death in the jallikattu at Vadamalappur in Pudukottai district on Saturday taking the toll in Trichy region to two this season.

The deceased has been identified as S Vadivel, 32, of Rajavayal village near Thirugokarnam. The incident happened around 3 pm as he, an organising committee member of the event, was on the ground. He was stamped on his abdomen by the bull that returned to the arena. Unable to sense the danger, the man received the blow. Police said that the wound was deep. He was admitted to Pudukottai Government Medical College Hospital, where he died around 6 pm.

State health minister Dr C Vijayabaskar inaugurated the jallikattu this morning. As many as 889 bulls and 158 bull tamers took part in the action, which left 19 people including eight tamers, bull owners and spectators injured. A bull was also injured in the event. Around 2,000 viewers, including 200 women watched the jallikattu.

On Friday, N Palalniyandi, 55, from Sukkampatti in Pudukottai was gored to death by a bull at the jallikattu in Aavarankadu near Manapparai in Trichy. A six-year-old girl suffered injuries after a bull’s horn scratched her chest while she was watching the jallikattu at Pothamettupatti village near Manapparai in Trichy district on Saturday. The bull, after being released from the vadivaasal, was charging against the barricade, behind which the girl was standing with her parents.

The doctors at the venue gave her first aid treatment and rushed her to the Government Head-quarters Hospital in Manapparai. Doctors who examined her there confirmed that she was out of danger. Later, she was referred to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) in Trichy. Doctors at MGMGH sutured the wound and put her under observation. Paediatricians attending to the girl had planned to perform a small procedure to drain any exudate, if formed, in the wound.

A senior doctor said that the girl had a narrow escape from losing her life as the injury was close to her heart. The girl would be treated in the hospital for few more days until she is fully recovered.

Jallikattu at Pothamettupatti witnessed 597 bulls in action and 376 tamers putting up their valour to tame the bulls. A total of 16 people including tamers, spectators and bull owners suffered injuries in the event.

Madurai: A five-day science camp for school students sponsored by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India is being held at The American College in Madurai. Even as Pongal holidays are in progress, around 150 enthusiastic students from across Tamil Nadu took part in the event to explore science and career options in scientific research

Innovation in Science Pursuit for Innovative Research (INSPIRE) camp was inaugurated on Wednesday by Dr V Ponraj, former advisor to the late President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam. A handy science guidebook for students was also released during the inaugural function by Dr Ponraj and Dr M Davamani Christober, principal and secretary of the college. “The aim of the camp is to empower students to explore the rich opportunities available in science and research. We have eminent professors and mentors covering all four science subjects as well as mathematics by giving both theoretical and practical training for students. We also have interactive sessions,” said Dr K John Adaikalasamy, program co-ordinator.

The INSPIRE camp is usually held for students of Class XI who have scored above 94% in their Class X board exams. This year, students were selected by the DST from 36 schools from across Tamil Nadu.

The participants said that the exposure presented them with opportunities to choose from beyond engineering or medicine. “I was actually kind of fixed with my ambition before. But, now, I’m rethinking because I got to know of so many other career options available within the field I like. We were particularly explained a lot about nanotechnology in Chemistry. We had no idea about it before,” said Ashwin Kumar, a student from a school in Madurai. The organizers said that this year, among the 150 students, 100 participants are girls.

Actor Sushant Singh addressed the protesters along with his wife

NEW DELHI: Narrating the tale of Musharraf Ali, the 30-year-old who died in the Anaj Mandi fire in Delhi after a desperate phone conversation with his friend Shobhit Agarwal , actor Sushant Singh said this tragic incident underlined Hindu-Muslim unity in the country. Now, he said, the newly notified Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), jeopardised this relationship between the two communities.

Singh was speaking to the crowd gathered Jamia Millia Islamia , where he had come to support the protest against the new citizenship law. The actor has been among the most vocal of Hindi film industry figures to denounce CAA and the National Register of Citizens. Singh was at Jamia with his wife Molina Singh.

Addressing the protest, which was in its 37th day on Saturday, Singh, said, “The fire in the illegal factory at Anaj Mandi, which killed 43 people, was, for me, the trigger of thoughts. It is a story of what happens in our country. The story is about two people from Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh. I am also from Bijnor. Musharraf, a Muslim, with his last breath, remembered his Hindu friend and left his family in his care. This is the story about all of us and the way we have lived in India. This is how we have to go ahead.”

His wife narrated how news of the police action in the university on December 15 had deeply disturbed the actor. Provoked, he went to a protest called by students in Mumbai the following day. “It was my 50th birthday that day. I had planned to celebrate it nicely, but Sushant was disturbed,” Molina Singh said. “So I asked him what he wanted to do. He told me he wanted to participate in the protest. I agreed, but told him not to talk much because it is the students’ voices that have to be heard.”

Singh admitted to being shocked by December 15 and deciding that the criticism of CAA and NRC had to become louder. “There is one thing we have to remember: hatred between Hindus and Muslims has always existed. We handled this by wearing a mask of secularism. But with CAA, even this mask has been ripped off,” the actor said.

Evan as Singh spoke, protesters were writing postcards to Chief Justice of India S A Bobde, requesting him to issue directions for the scrapping of the Citizenship Amendment Act, activist Farah Naqvi, Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac, Congress MP MV Rajeev Gowda and martyr Bhagat Singh’s nephew Jagmohan Singh also spoke to the protestors.

“How serious are we in eradicating the narcotics problem in Goa? We can blame the chief minister or MLAs or the police, and the media will say chief minister has made this statement, or I have made this statement. But nothing will happen. We have to take this more seriously and work on it. We ministers and MLAs have to take responsibility and sort this out,” he said.

“We need to sit with the chief minister and ask him to constitute a team of officers who will work on eradicating the drug problem. There has to be a one-year plan, and the chief minister should take periodic review meetings, preferably every week. If you don’t question the police then this situation will never end. They will work slowly as usual, make one or two arrests a month and say they’re on the job,” the minister said.

Trichy: A surprise check conducted on Friday by prison officials inside Trichy central prison unearthed mobile phones and accessories illegally used by a key accused in a sensational murder of a dalit youth.

A team of officials led by jailor Satheeshkumar conducted a check in the cells of the prisoners in the morning. The check at the cell of S Yuvaraj, an accused in the murder of Gokulraj, 21, brought to light two mobile phones, two SIM cards, two mobile phone chargers, which were hidden in his cell and a sewage tank outside his cell.

“The search was conducted based on the inputs received about the use of mobile phones inside the prison. The search paid off and we seized them. Preliminary enquiries revealed that Yuvaraj used the mobile phones. Now the investigation is on to find out how long he had been using the mobile phones inside the prison and who supplied them to him,” jailor Satheeshkumar told ToI.

He was a leader of the kongu-vellalar community in the western region of the state. He has been continuing as a remand prisoner in Trichy central prison for the past few years ever since he was transferred to Trichy from another jail following his surrender before the CB-CID office in the murder case of Gokulraj, a dalit youth. Gokulraj’s headless body was found on a railway track in Namakkal on June 24, 2015.

Deputy inspector general (DIG), prisons, Trichy range, G Shanmugasundaram said that investigation has been intensified to nab the people who had brought the gadgets to the prison for the prisoners. “We got information on some of the suspects. They will be caught soon,” he told ToI.

Like other prisons in the state, Trichy central prison was also infamous for movement of contrabands such as ganja until few years ago. Shanmugasundaram said that the movement of such items was completely stopped after officials enforced the strict vigil.

Acting on a complaint from the jailor, KK Nagar police have registered a case against Yuvaraj under The Prisoners Act.

NEW DELHI: Fighting a battle for survival, Congress has placed its bet on a mix of experience and youth by giving tickets to several former ministers and legislators, second generation members and young politicians for the upcoming assembly polls in the Capital.In its first list of 54 candidates released late on Saturday evening, 17 former MLAs, including five ministers, have been nominated by the party for the crucial polls, which will decide the party’s future in the changing political landscape of Delhi. The party has also named 10 women candidates, highest so far among the three major players, and about five Youth Congress leaders.In a first, Congress had stitched a pre-poll alliance, giving four seats to Rashtriya Janata Dal, which has never contested an election in Delhi. The list of remaining 12 seats, including the prestigious New Delhi, which has seen two chief ministers — Sheila Dikshit and Arvind Kejriwal contesting — and communally sensitive Okhla is likely to be released in a day or two.Among the prominent names who would be contesting are former health minister Ashok Kumar Walia — for the first time from Krishna Nagar — former transport minister Arvinder Singh Lovely from Gandhi Nagar, former power minister Haroon Yusuf from Ballimaran and former education minister Narendra Nath from Shahdara. Former MP Krishna Tirath, who was Union minister of women and child development in UPA–I government, has been fielded from Patel Nagar (SC). She was also an MLA and a minister in Sheila Dikshit’s first cabinet.Lovely had joined BJP in 2018 but returned to Congress a few months later. He contested the 2019 Lok Sabha poll on Congress ticket from East Delhi and came second. Tirath had also joined BJP and unsuccessfully contested the 2015 assembly polls from Patel Nagar. She returned to Congress last year.Senior party functionaries said the experience of these veteran leaders, some of whom have been four-to-five-term MLAs, will help the party put up a strong fight in Delhi. “If you keep the 2015 elections aside, which was a totally one-sided affair, most of our experienced leaders have done tremendously well over the years. They have been connected to the electorate and understand the issues well,” said Delhi Congress spokesman Jitender Kochar.The polls are being seen as Congress’s fight for regaining lost ground. It is perceived to be the weakest party in the triangular contest. After being in power for three consecutive terms, the grand old party faced a debilitating defeat in the 2013 elections after its vote bank shifted to the debutant Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). It had just eight seats in the 70-member House and somehow managed to notch up that number again. With its outside support, AAP formed its first government, which lasted for only 49 days.The worst came in 2015 when Congress failed to win a single seat. The following years saw several old-timers shift their loyalties to other parties. With AAP continuing to enjoy the support of the vote bank that once belonged to Congress, the party has its task cut out.Five-time MLA Mateen Ahmed, four-time legislator Jai Kishan and three-time MLAs Talvinder Singh Marwah, Surender Kumar and Veer Singh Dhingan have been nominated from their traditional seats of Seelampur, Sultanpur Majra, Jangpura, Bawana and Seemapuri, respectively. Former Congress working president Rajesh Lilothia, who contested the 2019 Lok sabha elections from North West Delhi, has been fielded from the reserved seat of Mangolpuri.Another former working president and two-term MLA Devender Yadav and Sumesh Shokeen will contest from Badli and Matial seats in Outer Delhi, respectively. Campaign committee chairman Kirti Azad’s wife, Poonam Azad, has been fielded from Sangam Vihar.Two sitting AAP MLAs, Alka Lamba and Adarsh Shastri, will re-contest from Chandni Chowk and Dwarka, respectively, on a Congress ticket this time. The two seats will witness an interesting battle with almost the same candidates who contested the 2015 polls facing each other though from different parties.The second-generation members who will be seen fighting on a Congress ticket this year include Shivani, daughter of Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra, and Priyanka Singh, daughter of former Speaker Yoganand Shastri.About 10 sitting and former municipal councillors are also in the fray.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73366404,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-159779,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/congs-first-list-mix-of-experience-youth/articleshow/73364200.cms

TRICHY: DMK president M K Stalin has appealed to the state government to conduct the consecration of Big Temple, which is scheduled to be held on February 5, in Tamil.

Thanjai Periya Koil Urimai Meetpukuzh has decided to conduct a conference urging the government to conduct the consecration in Tamil. That demand should be addressed by the government, he said in a statement here on Saturday.

During the DMK regime many ancient temples were rebuilt and rejuvenated and the ‘Kudamuzhukku’ (Consecration) ceremony was also administered under the leadership of former leader M Karunanidhi . The Sanscrit word ‘Kumbabishekam’ was replaced by the Tamil word ‘Kudamuzhukku’ during his regime, Stalin said.

“Struggles to restore the cultural identity of Tamil have been continuing in different forms over a period in the state. On this line, I wish that the conference organised by the Meetpukkuzhu will become a grand success. I also urge the AIADMK government to fulfill the demands of the conference,” Stalin said.

Thanjai Periya Kovil Urimai Meetpukuzhu will conduct a conference in Thanjavur on January 22 to press its demand to conduct the consecration ceremony in Tamil.

To explain the importance of the conference, Meetpukuzhu coordinator P Maniarasan will meet press people on January 20, a release from the outfit said.

TRICHY: About 70.50 lakh children below five years are scheduled to be covered during the Tamil Nadu Intensified Pulse Polio 2020 immunization drive to be held on Sunday across the state, health minister Dr C Vijaya Baskar has said.

“Tamil Nadu has been maintaining number one position as polio-free state for the 16 years. As far as India is concerned, incidence of polio is nil for the past nine years. Since polio incidence has been completely prevented, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Union health ministry has arranged for polio immunization drive once a year instead of twice per year,” Vijaya Baskar told reporters in Pudukottai on Saturday.

This year, the drive will be held at 43,051 regular booths across Tamil Nadu on January 19 (Sunday), he said adding that it will also take place at 1,652 additional transit booths in bus stations, railway stations, airports and checkposts.

A total of 1,000 mobile booths will be going around to cover children in brick kilns, construction sites, nomads and tribals in hilly areas .

About two lakh employees will be involved in the drive which will begin from 7am and end at 5pm.

The minister appealed to the public to make use of the drive to make Tamil Nadu a polio-free state.

301,['19/01/2020'],New contractor to finish repair works,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Kozhikode: Kozhikode corporation authorities have appointed a new contractor to complete the remaining revamping works at Mananchira, terminating the contract of the old contractor.

The contract of the Manappuram Constructions was terminated for failing to complete the works as per the timeline, despite extending the time period.

The civic body had floated re-tender and the contract has been entrusted to a private contractor, N Sajeev. The work of the Mananchira square was started jointly by the Kozhikode corporation and District Tourism Promotion Council. The first phase renovation of Mananchira was taken under the aid of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) and the corporation plan fund.

The park renovation work at Mananchira was envisaged at a cost of Rs 2.85 crore, of which 1.70 crore aid was from the DTPC, Rs 30 lakh from city corporation and the remaining Rs 85 lakh aid of the Amrut.

According to the corporation officials, Manappuram Constructions and Properties Limited, who won the tender failed to complete the work within the time frame, despite the time extension of four months by the civic body till May 31, 2019. Though the civic body had held talks with the contractor, they had failed to complete the works within the timeframe which forced the corporation to terminate the contract and entrust a new one to complete the remaining works. Manappuram constructions were able to complete only 15% of the total revamping works so far.

The revamping works such as the construction of a new entrance gate on the eastern side of the park, repair of the damaged compound wall, pathway, separate toilet blocks for men and women, food joints and rain shelters inside the Mananchira are planned. An open-air stage will also be constructed to conduct programmes in the evening.

Corporation town planning standing committee chairman M C Anilkumar said that the new contractor will complete the remaining revamping works in three months time. The revamping work planned by the DTPC has been progressing on a war footing. We aim to reopen the renovated Mananchira at the earliest as the renovation works of seven parks except Mananchira under Amrut are nearing completion.

Delhi high court

NEW DELHI: While hearing a petition filed by a representation of RWA, Delhi high court directed Delhi Police to look into the issue relating to the blockage of Kalindi Kunj Road due to the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests at Shaheen Bagh .

The plea claimed that there are a number of students who are due to appear for their board exams and the blockage of the stretch would cause inconvenience to them.

Justice Navin Chawla directed Delhi Police to consider the representation of Federation of Sarita Vihar Residents Welfare Association, which moved the court claiming that there are many students who are facing difficulties during board examinations as the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh has been closed since December 15 due to ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

“The closure of Road No. 13A and massive jams on Mathura Road will prevent students from reaching their schools on time, which will jeopardise their careers,” the plea stated. “That this vital arterial road No. 13 A, which connects Mathura Road near Apollo Hospital, Sarita Vihar/Jasola to Noida through Kalindi Kunj caters to lakhs of commuters every day to and from Noida to south Delhi and Faridabad/Gurgaon and is almost a lifeline of the people of these areas,” it added.

The plea claimed there is a multi-specialty hospital on Mathura Road, adjoining Road No. 13A and is extensively used by doctors, the staff of the hospital and patients. “There are a number of schools, colleges besides engineering and management institutes and also a couple of universities like Amity and Galgotias and thus a huge number of students who have to travel early in morning via this stretch to reach their respective educational institutions,” the petitioner said in the plea.

The plea also sought a direction to take all necessary and appropriate actions to restore all kinds of vehicular movement on Road No. 13A connecting Sarita Vihar, Jasola to Noida via Kalindi Kunj immediately.

After an earlier high court, Delhi Police on Friday tweeted: “We appeal to agitators at Shaheen Bagh to understand the sufferings that the complete highway blockade is causing to residents of Delhi and NCR, Senior Citizens, emergency patients and school going children. The matter has also come up before the Delhi high court.”

305,['19/01/2020'],Staff subletting or leasing quarters will face action: Railways,"This story is from January 19, 2020

TRICHY: Railways has instructed all divisional railway managers ( DRMs ) to take action against employees found subletting or leasing railway accommodation allotted to them. Officials said railway authorities have started inspections in Trichy division to find out those violating norms in this regard.

In a circular dated January 8 sent to DRMs, Railway Board’s establishment director Anita Gautam stated that accommodation allotted to a railway servant is meant only for his bonafide use and cannot be used for any purpose other than as residence. “No railway servant shall sublet, lease or otherwise allow occupation of government accommodation which has been allotted to him by any other person,” it said.

The DRMs have been asked to take necessary action for cancellation of such allotments and initiation of disciplinary action against errant employees. Such quarters should be vacated in a month and the action taken communicated to the board by February 17. Five types of quarters are allotted to railway employees based on their cadre. Around 1,700 quarters are there in type one, 1,100 in type two, 267 in type three, 119 in type four and 14 quarters in type five in Trichy railway division, sources said.

If any irregularities are found, stringent action would be initiated, a senior officer said. Deputy general secretary of Dakshin Railway Employees Union (DREU) D Manoharan said there was no possibility of employees misusing the facility as quarters are not allotted to them free of cost. An amount is being deducted from their salary as rent on the basis of the type of accommodation and there is no benefit for them in subletting or leasing the same.

“Irregularities may happen when bachelor employees are allotted quarters. Though some of them may allow others to stay by paying rent, that also is very rare. Vigilance authorities should conduct surprise check and take stringent action if there are any irregularities”, he stressed.

Panaji: Governor Satya Pal Malik urged political parties not to indulge in a blame-game over the Mhadei and mining issues.

He also urged them to stand united as Goans, while hoping that a decision on both the issues will be in the state’s interests.

When asked to comment on the Mhadei issue on the sidelines of an event at Taleigao, the governor said, “Don’t put me in a political controversy. I am for the people of Goa. Whatever steps the government takes, I fully support it. If they seek my help, I will offer it,” he said.

Malik also said that it is not within his ambit to take up issues with the Centre.

The governor said he has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi once over the Mhadei issue, after which the controversy over the letter was sorted out. “After this, I distanced myself from the issue. The government is working and they will be successful,” he said.

The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) had issued the letter to Karnataka granting environmental approval to go ahead with the water drinking project in Mhadei river, but after the governor’s meeting with the prime minister, the letter was kept in abeyance.

When asked if he has spoken to Union ministers over mining, Malik said, “Taking into account the initiatives taken by chief minister Pramod Sawant, I am sure the issue will be resolved. Through my interactions with leaders in Delhi, their foresight indicates that the mining issue will be resolved,” he said.

Malik said he has also requested Union home minister Amit Shah to invite the state government to discuss the mining issue. “I told Shah that he should support the state government’s formula and move forward to resolve the mining issue,” he said.

The governor alsosaid he met mining stakeholders.

PANAJI: Family members of ex-Merces sarpanch Prakash Naik, who allegedly shot himself dead on Friday at his home in Merces , said on Saturday that they would not accept his body until the two people named by him in a message were arrested. They also demanded that the case be moved from the Old Goa police to the crime branch.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant said he would receive the case report by Monday and that an inquiry would be conducted.

Naik, who was a sitting Merces panch member, allegedly shot himself minutes after posting a message on a 200-member strong WhatsApp group that he was “under tremendous pressure” from two persons over a property matter that he could not handle. Sources said one of the two persons mentioned by him in the message is the relative of a minister.

“Both the persons (named by Naik in his message) used to demand Rs 45 lakh from him, but we didn’t know why,” a family member told reporters. “We do not believe that he committed suicide.”

His sister, Akshaya Govekar, claimed that he had previously been attacked on two separate occasions.

Family members alleged that CCTV cameras at Naik’s residence had stopped functioning from January 15. They also said that on Friday, the maid had noticed that the back door of his house was open. They claimed that his body was found covered with a sheet and that the gun was inside the sheet and his hand was on his chest.

Naik’s brother, Vinay, said although the police have recorded the statements of Naik’s friends, they have not yet summoned the persons named in the message. “The police have neither given me copies of the statements nor have they brought in the dog squad,” he said.

Pritesh, Naik’s son, demanded that the CM investigate the case thoroughly.

Meanwhile, an autopsy of Naik’s body was conducted by a panel of doctors at the GMC, Bambolim, on Saturday. Police said the cause of death was “craniocerebral damage as a result of perforating fire arm missile injury that was antemortem and fresh at time of death”.

Naik’s body has been preserved at the GMC morgue.

Vijayawada: Anticipating that the ongoing protests by farmers in the region may obstruct the movement of legislators, officials of the Capital Region Development Authority ( CRDA ) are restoring an abandoned road near Krishnayapalem village as an alternative route to the Assembly .

The road that was laid during the inauguration of the secretariat building for VVIP movement was later abandoned and is presently not in use.

The state cabinet is expected to meet on Monday, followed by a special assembly session in which the government’s proposal to set up three capital cities is expected to receive legislative approval. Protests have continued in the capital region for the past 32 days and the Joint Action Committee has called to lay siege on the Assembly on Monday.

The new legislation is titled ‘The AP Decentralisation and Equal Development of All Regions Act, 2020’ and proposes to shift the executive capital to Visakhapatnam. The Act, however, will only say that the government is empowered to establish various state government organs and departments at different centres in different zones to ensure equal development of all regions. This is being done to avoid legal complications for the plan to move the capital city out of Amaravati .

The alternative route proposed for the chief minister, cabinet ministers and legislators runs along Krishnayapalem tank beyond Venkatapalem village and has been singled out as the most suitable route as it bypasses Mandadam and Velagapudi villages, which have turned into battlegrounds for the protests.

The CRDA has taken up patchwork repairs on the road that had been dug up for laying pipelines and ducts for underground electric cables. On Monday, police will divert all VVIP traffic from Mandadam and Velagapudi to this route.

Vijayawada: With the government likely to announce its stand on the three capitals in a special assembly session on Monday, political parties and Amaravati Joint Action Committee are gearing up to intensify protests.

Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi (APS) and JAC called on the public on Sunday to fight against the state government till it takes back its decision to shift the executive capital to Visakhapatnam.

JAC member and APCC vice president Sunkara Padmasri said, “The state government should come forward and negotiate with the farmers and women who have come out on the roads to protest. We are not afraid of the actions taken by the police and we are preparing to intensify our protests on Monday.”

Representative image

CHENNAI: The state education department will team up with more than 200 government, corporation and private schools in the city to put an end to bullying on school campuses. Faculty and students will be trained on identifying and dealing with bullying behaviours starting next month.

“We will hold such sessions for parents too so they can understand the intensity of the issue and look out for their wards,” said a senior official from the department. The programme will be conducted with paediatricians, scholars and educators for 12 weekends.

Officials said the initiative is aimed at creating a healthy environment for children in schools after they received complaints from parents and victims of bullying. “They (victims) simply refuse to go to school and many a time, they do not raise a complaint out of fear,” the official said.

The department also has plans to launch an online portal through which students can report any unsafe activities in schools, anonymously. Every school will have an anti-bullying task force comprising one teacher and five students from primary, middle and higher classes. This group will regularly interact with peers, act as mentors and hold awareness programmes on the long term impacts bullying can have on victims such as poorer physical and psychological health.

“We have found that children who have either bullied or been bullied often turn violent at a later stage,” said Jothi Kolathur, a city-based student counsellor.

Bullying is intentional and unprovoked and includes inflicting physical harm, excluding, body-shaming and other verbal abuse, badmouthing.

Jothi recalled an incident where a 12-year-old girl refused to go to school to avoid being bullied by her peers. They would call her names and comment on her skin tone. “She was ostracised from the class, she complained to the teacher but in vain. We had to counsel her and her classmates regularly to get things back to normal.”

Ezhilarasi, principal of T Nagar government girls school, said it was important to sensitise teachers because they spend the most time with children. “They can easily gauge the situation. They need to understand the seriousness of bullying and engage in direct dialogues with children.”

United Nations calls childhood bullying as a world-wide malaise. A Unicef study found that more than 30% of children were either bullied or were bullying others. In more than 50% of the cases, children accepted that bullying led to fights and quarrels, leaving them scared.

Psychiatrist Lakshmi Vijayakumar said bullies are often children who either witness domestic violence or are unable to perform well in school. Social media and video game addiction also play a role. “Children watch and learn from their elders. Hence, it is important that we behave well too.”

Mukesh Goel

NEW DELHI: Unlike BJP, not many councillors, sitting or former, could make it to the list of 54 candidates for the February 8 assembly polls announced by Congress on Saturday. Among the lucky ones were the sitting councillors Abhishek Dutt from Kasturba Nagar, Mukesh Goel from Adarsh Nagar, Amar Lata Sangwan from Timarpur and Mandeep Singh from Nangloi Jat.

Dutt said that as an area councillor he had worked in Andrews Ganj and its neighbouring areas for eight years. “We not only worked at the grassroots level, but also surveyed 12,000 households to understand the problems faced by residents” he said. Dutt alleged that the sitting MLA had sanctioned Rs 35 crore to develop infrastructure facilities, but people in Kotla and Defence Colony still struggled with broken roads. At Dayanand Colony, he said, overflowing sewer lines was a persistent problem, while the quality of water supply at Garhi was bothering residents.

Mukesh Goel, five times Congress councillor from Jahangirpuri and Sarai Pipalthala, also claimed to be in close touch with the locals and to be acquainted with their problems. This, he said, would help him work more efficiently. “In the past five years, due to cash-crunch and lack of coordination between BJP in the corporation and AAP in the government, people have suffered a lot and failed to get good civic services,” he claimed. “This was not the case during Sheila Dikshit’s tenure. If elected as MLA, I will raise the issues in colonies in the assembly and ensure that councillors in my area perform efficiently.”

Among the old-timers included in list are Dev Raj Arora in the Shakur Basti constituency, Satbir Singh (thrice councillor from Sarai Rohilla) in Sadar Bazar, Neeetu Verma in Malviya Nagar, Devendra Yadav (two-term MLA) in Badli and Gurcharan Singh Raju (former councillor from Preet Vihar) in Vishwas Nagar. The nominees reassured they would also take up issues related to the youth besides concentrating on development.

NEW DELHI: A 12-year-old boy, who had lost his way while heading to his uncle’s house, was recovered from Preet Vihar in east Delhi by the cops who found him crying by the roadside.

What was challenging for the police officers was that the child didn’t remember the name or address of his uncle.

Police officers said that the child had come to Delhi four days ago and had gone to Anand Vihar , where he lost his way. Unable to reach back to his uncle’s house, he somehow managed to reach Preet Vihar where he started panicking.

When the cops questioned him, all the boy could recall was that he was from Bihar. He was taken to the police station and counselled during which he could mention the district from which he hailed. Bihar police was contacted and the cops there started searching for the child’s home. They managed to narrow down the address to Morkari village. With the help of the photograph of the child, they were able to finally reach his mother. Based on her input, Delhi Police contacted the uncle in Anand Vihar and handed over the child to him. The whole operation took about half a day.

Bhubaneswar: Employees of the Odisha Tourism Development Corporation ( OTDC ) have opposed the government’s move to sell-off the Wooden Restaurant in Konark and its plan to privatise other properties of the corporation.

They have alleged that the popular restaurant was making profits but the government did not revive it after it was damaged in Cyclone Fani in May last year. “We were shocked when we came to know that the government has decided to run the Wooden Restaurant on a public private partnership mode. After it was damaged in Fani, the tourism minister and secretary had assured us of reviving it. Now what is the reason behind the sudden decision to privatise it?,” Benudhar Patra, working president of the OTDC Employees’ Association asked.

The restaurant was one of the preferred eateries of Konark would get 500 to 1,000 customers every day, Patra said. Sources said the restaurant had generated an annual revenue of Rs 37.92 lakh in 2017-18. It touched Rs 39.12 lakh in 2018-19 .

The employees said the restaurant was operating from the land belonging to the revenue department and OTDC was running it.

“According to law, the land cannot be given on sub-lease to a private party,” president of the association Sibananda Ray said.

Chilakaluripet police said the incident took place at around 10.30 am when an electrician was trying to change a pendant light at the pump. The three workers were helping him. They had brought in a 20-foot iron ladder to reach the bulb. While the four were shifting the ladder, it came into contact with a low-hanging live wire and all three were electrocuted.

While the electrician escaped with an injury to his hand, the other three were in contact with the metal ladder when electricity passed through them. While both Rao and Ali died on the spot, Sekhar was rushed to a local government hospital where he died while receiving treatment.

Police have registered a case under section 174 of CrPC (death due to electrocution) and all three bodies have been shifted for post-mortem.

PANAJI: The state government’s grandiose plan to construct Goa’s tallest building is taking shape, with 65 bidders evincing interest to design and provide project management consultancy.

A senior officer said Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) is in the process of shortlisting five bidders of this pool of 65.

GSIDC had floated expression of interest to invite consultants to design the ‘iconic’ highrise. The government has set a deadline of two years to complete the project.

“The selection of five bidders would be done after the winter session of the Goa assembly next month,” a senior government officer said.

The officer said the five bidders must submit a presentation of the design and financial bid. “The final bidder will be chosen based on their presentation,” the official said.

The government has planned to move all its offices in the state capital into a mammoth 75m-tall administrative complex that is expected to cost around Rs 150 crore.While the total height of the Atal Setu’s pylon is 70m, the building would be 5m taller.

Expected to come up by 2021, the building has been planned on an area of 9,000 sqm, at the location of the old state museum which has been demolished.

NEW DELHI: Following suit of URJA — the apex body of RWAs, which recently launched ‘People’s Green Manifesto 2020’ — two Delhi-based environmental NGOs have released a ‘green manifesto’ of their own, which they plan to submit to all three major political parties in Delhi ahead of the state assembly polls.

The manifesto — which has 18 different heads — asks the government to make environment education a mandatory subject in school curriculum; a blanket ban on felling of trees; income tax rebate for using metro and buses as well as strict implementation of the ban on single-use plastic that was drafted recently.

The manifesto, which has been compiled by NGOs Green Circle and New Delhi Nature Society, also asks for an increase in tree cover of native species by 5%, developing more city forests and biodiversity parks, while asking for officials to be made accountable for environmental targets.

Stressing on making environmental education a key subject in schools, the manifesto states that ‘students should get additional marks for better environmental practices’. It also seeks a ban on firecrackers on all occasions, while asking for reduction in noise pollution by banning honking at red lights.

In terms of tackling water wastage, the manifesto suggests using STPs to provide water for parks and asks for rainwater harvesting to be made mandatory in public places.

“Officials must be made accountable for environmental targets and green laws should be implemented in letter and spirit,” the ‘green manifesto’ states. V Selvarajan, founder of Green Circle, said people from different walks of life were contacted for drafting the manifesto so that Delhiites could be represented adequately.

Verhaen Khanna, founder of the New Delhi Nature Society, said the manifesto is being widely shared on social media. Physical copies, he said, will be presented to political parties in the next two days.

DEHRADUN: A team of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) along with city police raided two hookah bars here on Saturday. Owners of the hookah bars, both operating near college and educational institutions, were served notices for not having proper licence.

Yogendra Pandey, a food safety officer in Dehradun, said that the team raided two hookah bars on Saturday. “One was near Dehradun Institute of Technology while the other was near Uttaranchal University . Both the food and beverage centres had flavoured hookah and tobacco without licence. We have served them with notices,” said Pandey, adding that the hookah bars gave excuse that they were not aware of the norms.

“Though, we did not find any alcohol at hookah joints, we collected samples of flavoured hookah tobacco and ‘used ash’ to check if it contained nicotine or other banned substance,” he said. According to Supreme Court guidelines, outlets cannot serve nicotine in hookah, he added.

The FDA has also cited an order from district magistrate, C Ravishankar, issued last December, which stated that the city’s hookah bars should be properly checked.

PANAJI: Goa has 1.5 lakh students, but the science film festival of India sees the participation of only 25,000 to 30,000 students. Efforts must be made to take the festival to the deepest recesses of the state to involve all students, said MLA Subhash Shirodkar, chairman, Goa Housing Board.

He was speaking at the valedictory function of SCI-FFI 2020 at Inox Panaji on Saturday.

“There is a need to promote science and maths in six talukas of Goa where students are lacking scientific temperament,” he added.

These talukas, he said, are Sanguem, Dharbandora and Valpoi, among others.

He urged young scientists in Goa to patent their findings and inventions so that the scientific creations can be recognised. At the valedictory function, prizes were awarded to the short films that were made prior to the festival during the film-making and photography workshop.

Organised by the Vidnyan Parishad, Goa along with the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG) and other institutes, SCI-FFI 2020 was held from January 15 to January 18 at the Inox multiplex and Maquinez Palace.

“Each year we have tried to better ourselves and make this a sought after festival in Goa. The enthusiasm by students shows that at least a few will enter into science film-making which is one of the aims of this festival,” said Suhas Godse, president of Vidnyan Parishad Goa.

The four-day festival had over 9,500 delegates who watched film screenings, participated in workshops and masterclasses. Eight science fiction films were screened at the festival, of which four were Indian films. One of these, ‘Amori’, was a Goan entry.

“Through entertainment and film, science can be disseminated and understood. I am extremely delighted that ESG and the state has been pioneering such festivals and we will continue to do so,” said ESG chairman Subhash Phal Dessai.

CHENNAI: Indirect elections to elect chairman and vice-chairman of panchayat unions in Tiruttani, Thiruvalangadu, Pallipattu and R K Pet in Tiruvallur district was stalled indefinitely by district revenue officials, after councillors failed to turn up to vote.

The main reason, say sources, is because of members of factions within the AIADMK working against each other with support from other parties. The faction led by G Hari, former Arakkonam MP, with four panchayats on his side, is arrayed against those led by Tiruttani legislator Narasimhan, with three panchayat unions, and former state minister B V Ramana and party union secretary Sakthivel, with one panchayat union, in one group.

In the alleged kidnap of woman councillor K Poonkodi from Tiruttani, soources said she was initially offered Rs 3 lakh to support Hari’s faction, while the Narasimhan group offered her Rs 7 lakh apart from a job for a relative. Following this she went to Tirupati. After Hari’s group made a counter offer of Rs 10 lakh to Poonkodi’s husband Kotee to support the group candidate, Kotee filed a police complaint to trace his wife. This led to the rescue of Poonkodi from a lodge in Tirupati.

Denying any foul play, AIADMK ex-MP G Hari said, “Everything will be resolved and the chairman and vice-chairman posts will be filled. We don’t have any rivalry with anyone and we have not paid any councillors to get them to our side. They are voluntarily coming forward to show their respect and love for us.”

On his part, Hari’s rival Narasimhan, from Tiruttani, said the election was postponed due to the lack of quorum due to a fallout among councillors. “The state election commission will soon announce the dates and the four union heads and deputy head positions will be filled,” he said.

The party is likely to give most of the remaining 13 seats to alliance partners in a bid to improve ties with its allies and send across a message of being generous in power-sharing.Although BJP has not made any formal announcement about the number of seats to be shared with allies, there is a possibility it will spare at least four seats for Akali Dal , the same number it had given to the ally in the 2015 assembly polls, sources said.In the last elections, two Akali candidates — Harmeet Singh from Kalkaji and Jitender Pal from Shahdara — had fought on BJP symbol. Other two SAD candidates—Manjinder Singh Sirsa from Rajouri Garden and Avtar Singh from Harinagar— had contested on their party’s symbol. Sirsa, who won in the bypolls, however, joined BJP, leading to animosity among the partners. BJP has not named candidates for the four seats in its list of 57.Jannayak Janata Party of Dushyant Chautala is angling for Jat-dominated constituencies but sources said BJP is not in mood to give more than two seats to JJP.

The deceased students have been identified as Abhijit Samal of Hindalco Colony, Hirakud , and Soumya Ranjan Behuria of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. Both were third year computer science students.

CHENNAI: Only eyewitnesses can prove charges of rash and negligent driving, without such a witness such charge cannot hold good, the Madras high court has said.

Justice K Ravichandrabaabu made the observation while dismissing an appeal moved by the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) against the order of a labour court dated November 12, 201,3 directing the corporation to pay Rs 2 lakh compensation to the kin of a driver who was wrongly terminated by the TNSTC.

G Gopal (now deceased), was working as a driver for the corporation’s Villupuram division. On February 14, 1999, a bus driven by Gopal met with an accident in which three people died. According to Gopal, the accident was not due to his negligence or rash driving, but due to the fact that the vehicle was not properly maintained. However, the management terminated Gopal from service. Aggrieved, Gopal moved the labour court challenging his dismissal, which directed the corporation to pay Rs 2 lakh as compensation to Gopal’s kin as no eyewitnesses were examined to substantiate the charges levelled against him. TNSTC moved the present appeal challenging the same.

Rejecting the appeal, Justice Ravichandrabaabu said: “The right persons to speak about the accident are the eyewitnesses.” No eyewitness was examined in this case, he pointed out, adding: “The labour court was right in concluding that the dismissal of the deceased is not just.”

COLVA: Following repeated altercations between two groups over conducting watersports business at Majorda , Colva police have warned to temporarily halt activities until the issue is resolved.

Two new entrants — Shelton Da Silva and Succorina Pereira — stated that despite obtaining necessary persmissions from the tourism department to enter the watersports business at Majorda, they are being prevented by Menino Fernandes and his spouse Benedita Fernandes , who both possess individual permissions. The couple have been operating watersports activities at Majorda for the past five years and are refusing to accede to a queue system, the new entrants stated.

However, Menino said that he and his wife have been sole operators at Majorda, while the family members of Shelton and Succorina have permission to operate their business at Consua and Utorda respectively.

Cross complaints were filed on Wednesday at Colva police station. Later, the police had registered a non-cognisable offence against two of the warring parties. On Saturday evening, police again rushed to Majorda beach following complaints by the two new entrants that bouncers on the beach were threatening their workers. Colva police inspector Melson Colaco warned both the parties that if they don’t conduct their business peacefully, the police will have to halt watersports operations at Majorda till the issue is resolved.

Bareilly: Piles of garbage continue to be heaped or littered on roadsides though a central government team is expected to visit the city for inspection any time as the Swachhta Survekshan 2020 is underway.

Residents of several areas, including Rampur Garden, Civil Lines, Aijaz Nagar Goutiya, Jagatpur, Chak Mahmood, have alleged that no efforts are being made to clear the garbage.

According to Vivek Singh of Jagatpur, “The roads in the area are piled up with garbage. Civic authorities have not taken up measures to clean the area. Almost every lane and by-lane is littered with garbage. The condition worsens after every spell of rainfall as the trash gets carried with rainwater into the drains. As a result, drains here get clogged and often overflow.”

Kishore, a shopkeeper in Chak Mahmood, an area adjacent to Jagatpur, said, “We have not seen garbage being lifted here for more than two months. Even local residents have now earmarked spots to dump the trash as it lies unattended for several months. Stray dogs and cows who feed on the garbage also scatter it on the main roads. The area stinks due to the garbage most of the time.”

The situation is no different in prominent areas such as Civil Lines, Rampur Garden and Shahdana. Residents of these areas alleged that while garbage is being lifted from houses, the roads are not being cleaned. “Workers come for garbage collection but the roads are neglected for days on end,” said Abdul Naseem, a shopkeeper in Shahdana, Old City.

Bareilly municipal corporation officials, however, maintained that authorities are working full on to maintain cleanliness in city and ensure garbage-free roads. Sanjeev Pradhan, environment engineer, said, “Work of deputing some 600 sanitation workers with around 400 rickshaws for lifting garbage across 80 wards under the municipal corporation is underway. Cleanliness exercise is being conducted in the city during the night as well despite adverse weather conditions. We are also working on complaints lodged by locals at the Nigam office in this regard. If some areas are left, they will be covered too. Moreover, local residents are also responsible for littering roads. It is important that people cooperate in making the city free of filth. For the purpose, we have recently kickstarted work of painting public places, walls of highways and roads with pictures and messages on cleanliness.”

Swachhta Survekshan 2020 is underway and a central government team will soon be visiting the city to conduct surveys in order to ascertain city’s status in terms of cleanliness and ODF status among other things. City’s progress will also be checked on the basis of awareness among public regarding cleanliness issues and participation of local residents to ensure that their city is among ‘swachh’ cities of the state. Bareilly was ranked 117 during Swachhta Survekshan 2019.

Foresters found cartridges of bullets fired from 12 bore gun near the carcasses

Rajkot/Ahmedabad: Three wild asses , locally known as Gudkhar , were found dead with bullet wounds near Koparni village of Dhrangadhra taluka of Surendranagar on Saturday. Forest officials suspect that the animals were hunted down for pleasure by some miscreants.

The incident came to light after some salt pan workers working nearby heard gunshots and informed the forest officials who reached the spot.

Forest officials said that the carcasses of the adult females were found in the village that borders the Little Rann of Kutch (LRK) and the Wild Ass Sanctuary.

Deputy conservator of forests of the Wild Ass Sanctuary S S Asoda said that they have found cartridges of bullets fired from 12 bore gun near the carcasses. “It is suspected that the wild asses were shot for pleasure hunting. We are also probing if the animals were shot for entering fields,” Asoda told TOI. He added that nobody had been arrested so far in connection with the killings. Range forest officer K A Multani said that all the three asses had bullet wounds and were found in 600 sq m area. The Asiatic wild ass fall under schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act. According to the last count there were 4,500 wild asses in the sanctuary. The next count is scheduled in February.

Principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Shyamal Tikadar said, “Prima facie it appears to be a case of hunting for pleasure not poaching. This is first time that such incident has come to light. So we are keeping special vigil. Those responsible for this act will be arrested soon.” However, sources close to the village where the incident took place, claimed that hunting of wild asses was being done on regular basis in the region. One of the villagers, who did not want to be named said that people did not object to the hunting as the wild asses were a nuisance to the standing crop.

Even as senior forest officer, on condition of anonymity, admitted that such practice was going on in the LRK region for some time. He added that meat of the wild ass was sold to the local suppliers.

NEW DELHI: Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) will move court on Monday to challenge the rule that has let the administration bring in the hostel fee hikes. “We will go to Delhi high court on Monday challenging the legality of the rules under which the hikes were brought in,” JNUSU vice-president Saket Moon said on Saturday.

The union again dismissed the JNU administration’s claim that more than 70% of the students have registered for the winter semester. Friday was the last day of the registration under the extended scheme. From Monday, the registration process will cost students a fine of Rs 100 per day.

“One cannot really trust the administration. They are known to inflate numbers. Just completing one process of registration is being counted as the registration figure,” said Moon. JNU registrar Pramod Kumar did not respond to calls.

A PhD scholar said, “If the administration is claiming the registration numbers, it means students are paying the hiked fees. That is the first process to begin the registration. We really don’t know where this movement is headed. We hope the court gives a clear-cut instruction.”

JNUSU may also separately file a case for over 300 students who have been placed under academic suspension following a proctorial inquiry.

The union has given a call for a protest on Sunday to open North Gate, which has been closed since January 5 when violence broke out on the campus. It will also protest against the “complicity of Delhi Police” and no arrest in the case.

In the meantime, a delegation of JNU faculty members from scheduled caste and scheduled tribe communities met Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan and submitted a memorandum accusing the university administration of discrimination against teachers, students and other staff from these underprivileged sections. Calling the allegations serious, Paswan said these should be looked into. The JNU administration, however, refuted all allegations.

However, the regional meteorological centre has predicted clear weather conditions on Sunday.

Similarly, snowfall in Mussoorie also brought down mercury levels in the hill town. The maximum temperature was recorded at 6 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature settled at 2 degrees Celsius on the day.

Though the spell didn’t last long and snow didn’t accumulate on the ground, snowfall cheered the tourists who were in town for the weekend. The snowfall began at around 5:30 pm and lasted for almost 30 minutes.

“It was amazing to watch the snowflakes coming down from the sky. It’s a pity that it stopped so soon. Only a thin layer of snow covered rooftops,” said Anubhav Kumar, a tourist from New Delhi.

Mussoorie has been witnessing severe cold conditions since the advent of the winter season and the hill town has earlier received snow spells on January 4 and January 8 this year.

Meanwhile, higher reaches of Munsyari and Dharchula received fresh snowfall on the day while lower regions of Pithoragarh district received rain spells. In Pithoragarh town, hailstorms disrupted daily life.

Coimbatore: The traffic police have begun to crack down on people fitting coloured LED lights on their vehicles. They have so far booked 29 vehicle owners for the offence. As per the Motor Vehicles Act, vehicles are not allowed to fit any coloured light either in the front or the back, as they could glare the vision of motorists coming in from the opposite direction and cause accidents.

Of the 29 vehicles caught for the offence, 20 were two-wheelers and the remaining were cars, buses and autorickshaws, said Mutharasu, deputy commissioner of traffic. While all the two-wheelers have been seized, other vehicles were fined and let off. “Some fix the coloured LED lights to grab attention, while others do it just to decorate their vehicle. There are some people who do this as they want vehicles coming in from the opposite direction to immediately give way, so they could drive faster. These lights could glare the vision of motorists coming in from the opposite direction and cause accidents,” he said.

Mutharasu said the vehicles were caught during a special drive that they launched across the city since Friday. “We have registered cases against them and seized their vehicles to make them appear before court,” said Rajesh Khanna, assistant commissioner of traffic (west). Recently, a magistrate court in the district had imposed a fine of Rs10,000 on a vehicle owner for using LED lights.

In another instance, the traffic police have seized 119 vehicles for fitting air horns . Of them, 80 are buses and the remaining, trucks. “They are privately owned town buses going to Mettupalayam, Tirupur and Pollachi,” said a senior official. “Air horns are sometimes two to five times noisier than the vehicle’s original horn and is mainly used to force vehicles in front to move aside and give way. Many drivers give way not being able to bear the constant loud honking behind them.”

Hyderabad: To spread awareness on safe insulin injection practices for type-2 diabetes patients, a multi-city educational campaign was organised by endocrinologists as part of Insulin Injection Day on Friday. Insulin Injection Day commemorates the 98th anniversary of first successful insulin administration on January 11, 1922, at Toronto General Hospital, Canada.

Prof Rakesh Sahay, head of department of endocrinology, Osmania Medical College & Osmania General Hospital, said: “For most people living with diabetes, insulin is an essential treatment. Awareness campaigns like ‘Insulin Injection Day’ are noteworthy and highlight best practices such as using new needle for every injection, always rotating injection sites and more.”

The conference also emphasised that incorrect insulin injection technique could lead to lipohypertrophy, a thickened and rubbery swelling under the skin at the patient’s usual injection sites. Lipohypertrophy could lead to poor glycaemic control, hypoglycemia and glycaemic variability.

Coimbatore: One week after two armed men gunned down special sub-inspector Y Wilson, 57 , at Kaliyakkavilai check post in Kanyakumari district, the police department has tightened security along the inter-state boundary in Coimbatore and the Nilgiris, and issued firearms to the personnel manning check posts.

The Coimbatore rural police have beefed up security at all the 14 border check posts, a senior police officer told TOI. “Two sub-inspectors and six cops have been deployed at each check post. Each check post has been allotted a self-loading rifle (SLR) and a pistol. Our personnel have been instructed unofficially to use the weapons if they face threat to their lives,” the officer said.

Police are monitoring vehicle movement through check posts, inspector general of police K Periaiah said. “All the check posts have been fitted with CCTV cameras and our personnel are monitoring them round-the-clock,” he said.

All the 16 check posts in the Nilgiris have automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras and internet protocol (IP) cameras, superintendent of police V Sasi Mohan said. “We check all the vehicles that enter the state.

370,['19/01/2020'],VMC intensifies drive against single-use plastic in a bid to improve SS-20 ranking,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Vijayawada: The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation ( VMC ) has intensified its special drive against single-use plastic in the city. Vigilance teams of the civic body have been inspecting commercial areas and seizing stocks from errant shopkeepers

The VMC, which is focused on improving its rank in Swachh Survekshan 2020 , banned single-use plastic from October 2, 2019.

Following the ban, the civic body threatened to impose penalties and cancel trade licences if vendors were to continue using single-use plastic. Its sanitation wing conducted a series of awareness camps on the need to use cloth bags.

But while a majority of medium and large business establishments have shifted to cloth and jute bags to avoid huge penalties, street vendors and small businesses are still using single-use plastic bags, given their low price.

So, the VMC has now turned its focus on wholesale traders of plastic bags, rather than impose penalties on small-time vendors.

Speaking to TOI, VMC health officer Dr Iqbal said, “Use of plastic has come down significantly since the ban was imposed. Citizens have responded positively to our call and we are happy. But a few vendors are still using plastic carry bags. Hence, we have started conducting special drives against super stockists of carrying bags and imposing huge penalties on them.”

He added that cloth bags might be expensive currently, but the price will come down once production picks up. “We are encouraging self-help groups to stitch cloth bags,” he said.

371,['19/01/2020'],Fliers to city to be screened for new coronavirus from China,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Coimbatore: Passengers flying into the city from abroad will now be screened for coronavirus. According to sources, the move comes three days after two Asian countries - Japan and Thailand – reporting first cases of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Health department officials have reactivated the fever screening set up in the city airport to screen the passengers with symptoms of cold and cough. According to an official, those who have visited China 14 days prior to developing the symptoms or worked in any hospital that treats patients with 2019-nCoV, they would be asked to get tested for the virus.

There is also a move to compulsorily quarantine the passengers who have visited Wuhan district in China for 14 days, even if they do not display flu-like symptoms. Dr Ramesh, deputy director of health, Coimbatore, said, “We have asked a doctor and a nursing staff to be in the airport during the arrival times of the three international flights. The flight from Singapore lands in the city at 10pm, while the flights from Colombo and Sharjah arrive at 2.30pm and 3.30am, respectively.”

While the screening started on Saturday, he said they hadn’t received any passenger, who had visited Wuhan district, or with flu-like symptoms.

On December 31, 2019, the China country office of World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown case that were detected in Wuhan city. Chinese authorities then found novel coronavirus, a zoonotic virus, to be the cause. Like H1N1 virus, it causes flu-like symptoms of cold, cough and fever, sometimes followed by pneumonia, acute respiratory illness, breathlessness and kidney failure, leading to death.

The WHO subsequently put other countries on alert and published an interim guidance on how to prepare for the virus, how to monitor sick people, test samples, control infection and treat patients. Three days ago, Japan and Thailand had confirmed first cases of the virus outside China and Wuhan.

A couple of weeks ago, directors of public health in the country were notified about the coronavirus and issued guidelines on how to monitor and control the infection. After the two Asian countries detected their first cases of 2019-nCoV, authorities seem to have swung into action.

The illegal structure under construction at Ibrahimbagh Cheruvu

HYDERABAD: The construction work on the Full Tank Level of Ibrahimbagh Cheruvu continues unabated. What is worrying residents is that work on the structure is being carried out right under the noses of officials. The irrigation department had started construction of a sewage line near the cheruvu and locals say it is ironic that an ‘illegal’ construction abutting it has not been removed.

Sunil Sathyavolu, a resident, who has been running from pillar to post to save the water body, said, “A part of the lake has already been encroached for a graveyard. There are several other spots as well at which the lake has been encroached.”

He said the primary cause of concern is that fencing has not been done for the lake. “We are desperate for the work to be completed so that fresh encroachments do not take place,” said Sathyavolu.

Manoj Kumar, who lives in the area, added, “Though official work started and gave us all hope, it slowed down due to unknown reasons. We request the officials to finish work before the rains.”

Residents say drain water from higher areas such including Jubilee Hills , Durgam Cheruvu flows into Ibrahim Cheruvu making it a cesspool.

The irrigation department's assistant executive engineer Viswam Datta said, “We have written to the local municipal officials and revenue department to take action.”

According to her father, Mira Devi, a Champaran (Bihar) native, was married to a Badaun resident. However, the man abandoned Mira after she displayed symptoms of mental illness. Mira’s father even lodged a missing complaint but she couldn’t be traced.

Meanwhile, the woman was spotted by social worker Shailesh Kumar Sharma, who is also a clinical psychologist and runs an NGO named Manosamarpan Psychological Sservice Society. Sharma counseled the woman for months and gathered information about her parents. Later, he contacted local police for assistance.

“I started counselling Mira in November, 2017. Back then, she was rarely able to share information about herself. However after few counselling sessions, she could tell us about her home district. Subsequently, we started communicating with local police. Our efforts finally paid off when her father Lallan Ram came to Bareilly and took her along with him. We are happy that another patient is reunited with family.”

Meanwhile, Bareilly mental hospital director Dr Pramila Gaur said, “Mira was brought over here on February 17, 2017. She was an unidentified mentally ill patient but we managed to trace her address with the help of an NGO.

Meraki staged a show ‘Lamaan - Ek Natyapravas’ in honour of Dr Shriram Lagoo, on Friday

NAGPUR: A gripping narration depicting life journey of legendary actor Dr Shriram Lagoo based on his autobiography ‘Lamaan’ won hearts of theatre lovers at Rashtrabhasha Bhavan, North Ambazari Road, on Friday.

Titled ‘Lamaan -- Ek Natyapravas’, the reading and acting session, organized by Meraki Theatre, saw Dr Sushil Solanki effectively portraying some of the memorable roles Lagoo played in a career spanning over decades. Solanki presented a scene from celebrated Marathi play ‘Natsamrat’, written by Dnyanpeeth award winner VV Shirwadkar.

Solanki was intense in telling how the king of theatre fell on bad days and rendered homeless by his children to whom he handed over his property with trust that they would look after him and his wife in the twilight of life. But he was betrayed.

In his musings in ‘Lamaan’, Lagoo said an actor should be an ‘athlete philosopher’, have a thinking mind and firm opinion on various issues that life can throw at. Lagoo had in him all these qualities. Important scenes of the actor’s films beamed on the screen added to the beauty of the programme.

Meraki members Chetan Wagh, Nikita Dhakulkar and Ruturaj Wankhede excelled in reading out excerpts from ‘Lamaan’ that spoke of many facets of Lagoo. Scenes from Marathi movie Devkinandan Gopala, based on sant Gadge Baba, and play ‘Surya Pahilela Manoos’ in which Lagoo played lead roles, were touching.

The artistes also read out some portions from the autobiography in which Lagoo’s views on importance of cultivating voice, modulations and control over breath were detailed.

Children’s drama ‘Krishnaniti’, staged by students of BR Mundle School, impressed the audience. The play spread the message of not wasting food. The importance of giving leftover food to needy people was highlighted.

It also highlighted scenes from epic Mahabharata in which generosity of Karna, role of Krishna and ‘karma’ were depicted. Mrunmayee Pande and Parth Khapre portrayed Karna and Krishna, respectively.

The festival was organized at ‘Theatre With Nature’ in which plays which made it to the final round of the 59th Maharashtra State Amateur Marathi Drama Competition from Nagpur centre, were staged.

Congress leader Hardik Patel

AHMEDABAD: Congress leader Hardik Patel was arrested on Saturday night from Viramgam taluka in Ahmedabad district for failing to appear before a trial court here in a 2015 sedition case, hours after a warrant was issued against him.

Patel was sent to Sabarmati Central Jail in judicial custody till January 24.

A city sessions court on Saturday issued an arrest warrant against Patel for his continued absence from the courtroom during the trial of the sedition case lodged against him and other Patidar reservation agitation leaders.

He was produced before the additional sessions judge B J Ganatra, who had ordered the issuing of an arrest warrant, in the evening.

The state government had objected to the absence of Patel and his two co-accused and demanded an arrest warrant against them. However, the other two accused appeared in court with their advocates while public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt tendered the application to the court.

The prosecutor sought a warrant against Patel also on the ground that after promising the court to cross-examine a witness on Saturday, he remained absent. He said that the witness, Vijay Badheka, was present in court for cross-examination on Friday, but time was sought on behalf of the accused. The witness turned up the next day, but the accused was absent. “This was nothing but a delaying tactic adopted by Patel for long,” he argued. This led the court to issue an arrest warrant.

On the other hand, Patel’s advocate requested the court to grant him exemption from presence in court on Saturday. The court was of the view that Patel’s absence was a violation of the conditions laid down by the Gujarat high court while granting him bail that he should regularly remain present before the trial court.

The court rejected the application for exemption and ordered his arrest instead. Patel and two others are being tried for sedition based on charges slapped by city crime branch for allegedly inciting violence during the Patidar reservation movement in August 2015.

A crowded lane in one of the many markets on Ring Road

SURAT: The devastating fire in Raghuvir Celeum Textile Market has prompted fire and emergency services department of Surat Municipal Corporation ( SMC ) to check fire safety preparedness in the textile markets located on Ring Road.

The fire department has started mock drill exercise to identify obstacles in these textile markets. Fire officials said about 21 textile markets have been identified on Ring Road for mock drill exercise that began from Saturday. The mock drill exercise will cover one market each day for the coming days.

Chief fire officer Basant Pareek told TOI, “The mock drill exercise will not only prepare firefighters to deal with the fire situation, but help us in identifying underlying problems in the textile markets.”

Pareek said the area remains congested throughout the day due to transport vehicles and presence of thousands of people connected with textile trade in the lanes and outside the markets.

During the first day of the mock drill exercise, the fire control room received a call of fire from Rishabh Textile Market on Ring Road. The fire was reported on the seventh floor of the market. Four tenders and an ambulance rushed to the market in the afternoon. The entry gate of the market had a ramp, which prevented fire tenders from entering the market. Also, the height of the main entry gate at the market was very low which prevented fire tenders from performing fire dousing exercise.

Pareek said, “The entry gate of the market had a ramp, a margin wall had been constructed and there was an electricity power substation in the market. The road leading to the market was jam-packed and there were encroachments in the form of roadside eateries and sheds constructed in the parking area.”

“Fire vehicles entry into the markets on Ring Road is very difficult due to narrow gates and obstacles in the parking areas. We will be submitting a detailed report to urban development and planning department of the civic body for necessary action” he added.

Dehradun: The man-eater leopard of Haridwar, which had killed a labourer in BHEL area on January 10, was shot dead near Kendriya Vidyalaya in BHEL area on Saturday evening.

Locals had been protesting over the forest department’s failure to capture or kill the big cat. They also claimed that the animal was digging graves and feeding on corpses, even as the DFO called it a false speculation. Members of the state’s Opposition parties had also joined the agitation.

The forest department had installed seven cages at six sensitive areas and enhanced patrolling in Haridwar to capture the leopard.

The leopard attacked a man on October 26 last year near Sector-4 of BHEL area. On January 4 this year, the animal claimed a life near Subhas Nagar. In January 10, the leopard killed a labourer in Sector- 5 of BHEL area.

This is the second time that water cuts will take place as last week the KMC had reported a leakage

KOLHAPUR: The A and B ward of the city and suburbs will be facing water cuts for the next two days starting from Monday.

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has reported major leakage in the main pipeline carrying water from Aptenagar pumping station to the areas of A and B wards along with the nearby suburbs.

This is the second time that water cuts will take place as last week the KMC had reported a leakage.

A senior official of the water supply department, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The repair work will be carried out on Monday. We have reported a huge loss of water through the leakage. Even after carrying out the repairs works for the earlier leakage, the water supply to the A and B wards received water with inadequate pressure. After checking the repair work, our staff found another leakage few meter away. We have planned the water cuts for two days. However, we will ensure that the water supply will get normal on Wednesday.”

The KMC has appealed to the citizens to store water for the days of water cut . The areas such as Phulewadi Ring road, Sane Guruji Vasahat, Aptenagar, Rajopadhye Nagar, Kanerkar Nagar, Tuljabhavani Colony and Devkar Panand will be affected badly. The KMC has planned to deploy nine water tankers to provide drinking water to the citizens of affected areas.

“We are going to carry out the hydraulic testing of the entire pipe on Sunday and if any other leakage is found, we will repair in the two days,” said the official.

The KMC is expected to face the wrath of the citizens since these areas have been frequently facing the water cuts in the past two months.

The KMC officials said that once the work of laying the new pipeline in these areas are completed the water supply will be normal. The official said that 40% of the locality do not have water pipelines and mostly are depending on the water tankers either provided by the KMC or procured from the private water tanker suppliers.

Last week, half of the city including residents of A and B ward and people from suburban area faced water cuts for two days after the KMC officials started repair work of the leaks in the main pipeline carrying water from Aptenagar pumping station to Phulewadi.

""The demand for water increases during festivals and summer. At present, we expect less demand for water from the residents and will manage with the adequate supply for the tankers. We will repair the leaks in the pipelines and ensure that there aren’t any problems in the near future,"" said a KMC official attached with water supply department.

DEHRADUN: A mentally-ill woman, who has a four-year-old daughter, allegedly strangulated her 61-year-old father to death in Haldwani on Friday night.

Sushil Kumar, police station officer of Banbhoopura, told TOI on Saturday that the woman, married in Delhi, was recently taken to her father’s house. She has been admitted to a hospital now. The police are yet to file an FIR.

“We received calls from tenants of deceased Soor Singh Negi that he was attacked by his daughter. We reached the house at 10 30 pm and Negi was already taken to a hospital where he was declared dead,” said Kumar, adding that Negi’s elder son who is currently posted in the army in Pune was informed. He is now on his way to Haldwani. The woman’s husband is also said to be on his way from Delhi.

“Negi was a retired army man. His daughter was married in Delhi and was brought to Negi’s house because of her mental illness. The tenants of the deceased told us that his daughter used to get violent at times,” Kumar said.

Sources said the woman, who was struggling with her mental condition for several months, has been staying on the third floor at a Delhi house and her father was in constant fear that she may jump from her floor or the terrace. So, he reportedly brought her to his place.

Police were told that Negi had locked the doors of the house on Friday evening as she was trying to go out. So, no one could enter the house and rescue Negi.

“We have handed over the woman’s four-year-old daughter to the tenants,” said the police.

According to FIR, at about 6.30pm on Friday when he was working at Pancham Society, two men arrived in a car and parked it a way that would obstruct others.

391,['19/01/2020'],"Operator cancels bus, Geethu stuck at Bengaluru","This story is from January 19, 2020

KOCHI: Geethu Mohandas , the first Indian woman selected for the famed Fjällräven Polar, an expedition to the Arctic for ordinary people from different parts of the world, faced travel hassles at Bengaluru on Saturday night as the bus operator cancelled its Kochi service at the last minute. She also sought the help of local police.

“The bus was scheduled to leave Madiwala at 8.15pm and at 7.15pm I got a message about the cancellation. By that time, I had left for Madiwala and the bus operator hadn’t made alternative arrangements. My mother and I are stranded. Am trying to figure out how to reach Kochi. If I drop the plan and return, I can’t reach on Sunday,” she said.

Mohandas, who hails from Aluva, is all excited as she was chosen to be a part of the international polar expedition. “The entire expedition covers 300km and gives you an opportunity to explore winter wilderness of northern Scandinavia,” she said.

The seven-day expedition will start on March 20 and conclude on April 6. The participants from 22 countries will have to pull their food and equipment on sledges. The interesting part of the race is over 200 Alaskan and Siberian Huskies will be a part of the team. “I have never been on a sledge with dogs. While the dogs rely on you for food, the participants rely on them for skills and companionship,” she added. The expedition is all about survival in extreme cold.

Mohandas was chosen by voting in ‘The World’ category of Fjällräven Polar. The organizers meet the entire expenses of the expedition. “As I plan to go to Sweden four days before the event, I will have to spend some money to meet that expenses,” she said.

The seed for Fjällräven Polar was planted back in the early 1990s when Fjallraven founder Ake Nordin met Kenth Fjellborg, one of Sweden’s leading dog-sled drivers. Kenth had participated in Iditarod, the world’s most difficult dog sled competition through the harsh Alaskan wilderness, and this inspired Ake.

They wanted to create a Swedish equivalent, but not for experts like Kenth – for ordinary people. And a few years later in 1997, once all the details were ironed out, Fjallraven Polar took place in the Scandinavian Arctic for the first time.

Agra: Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) students on Saturday burnt effigies of vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor and registrar Abdul Hamid on the campus and demanded their resignation for their failure to protect them from police excesses on December 15.

The students shouted slogans against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register and took out a tricolour balloon march. The protesting students alleged that the VC and registrar were responsible for the atrocities they suffered on campus as the latter had allowed police to enter in it.

Talking with mediapersons, students’ leader Faizul Hassan said they will continue their protest against them (VC and registrar) till the duo quit their posts. He said students are not impressed by the explanation offered to them by the VC, when he visited the protest site.

While interacting with students, VC Mansoor had told them that he deeply regretted that students suffered injuries and the inconvenience they faced when they were asked to vacate hostels. He also said the police entry was an aberration and the university should function on its own.

Meanwhile, AMU vice-chancellor Mansoor has constituted a seven-member committee on Saturday in order to open a dialogue with students. The committee will look into the matter of FIRs lodged against students, compensation to the injured students and other grievances relating to the incidents which took place on the intervening night of December 15 and 16.

There are 1,227 KVs and 636 JNVs running across the country under the department of school education and literacy of HRD ministry, where more than 13 lakh students are enrolled.

Prajapati also said the violation of OBC reservation is mostly observed at public sector units.

“Now, we are covering each and every state extensively like never before to get the exact status of OBC reservation in higher education and government jobs. Senior officials of the districts have been instructed to ensure OBC quota is being followed in jobs of PSUs in their respective districts.

Bareilly: On the third day of his Moradabad visit, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said that each and every citizen of India should follow the guidelines of the Constitution in daily life. He added that those opposing the RSS are only opponents of the organisation and not enemies.

Addressing RSS volunteers on Saturday, the organisation’s chief said that whoever believes in Indian culture is a Hindu despite the barriers of language, caste or region the person belongs to. “Even though we don’t practise similar forms of worship, we all belong to the same culture. This unity in diversity is the beauty of our nation. Our ultimate goal should be to keep this unity intact,” he added.

Reiterating that the roots of every Indian is the same, Bhagwat said, “We share a common culture. Even though no barrier of caste, language, food or regionalism divides us, one will have to get rid of narrow mindedness, radicalism, discrimination and selfishness to be a true Indian. Each and everyone who believes in Indian culture is a Hindu.”

He added that there is a lack of clarity among common people about the role and activities of RSS in the country. “The organisation has changed with the changing times. It is difficult to fully comprehend its activities as it has no parallel in the country,” he further added.

Bhagwat said, “India has followed a path of peace before and after Independence. If we want to continue on this path, we will have to be a powerful country. The US and China get away with human rights violations as they are super powers.”

Ahmedabad: A motor vehicle accident tribunal (MACT) ordered compensation of Rs 85 lakh for the accidental death of a British citizen, after considering the family background of the deceased and other benefits given by the British government in the form of social security etc.

The tribunal in Gandhinagar ordered the owners of two vehicles and their insurers to pay the sum with 8% interest since 2009, for the death of 26-year-old Rakesh Sharma, who was killed in an accident while his visiting his native village near Dehgam. Sharma was a teacher at South Thames College in London.

Sharma was killed on October 4, 2009, while travelling by car from Dehgam to Ahmedabad. The car hit with a stationary truck. He died on the spot. Sharma’s sister, Minakshi, a resident of London, approached the tribunal and claimed Rs 2 crore compensation. She produced a certificate from the UK family court stating that she is Sharma’s only heir. He was brought up by her in London, after she moved there in 1998.

The tribunal was supplied Sharma’s bank statements and pay slips to establish that he was earning £1,300 every month. The tribunal considered the exchange rate of October 2009 – Rs 76 for a pound — to arrive at a salary at Rs 98,800.

After calculating Sharma’s income, the question for the tribunal was to fix a reasonable amount that could be awarded to Minakshi towards her dependency loss, because her brother was a British citizen employed abroad. Looking at Shrama’s age, the tribunal put his future prospects at an additional 30% of his last income and calculated that his income should be considered at Rs 1.28 lakh per month. The tribunal further deducted 50% of his salary towards personal expenses and concluded that Minakshi would have got Rs 7.70 lakh annually from her brother.

The tribunal further decided to consider multiplier of ‘11’ of Sharma’s income. It considered the family background of the deceased and other benefits given by the British government in form of social security etc., and the law laid down by the Supreme Court to come to the multiplier of 11 to award compensation.

Pawan Kalyan

VIJAYAWADA: Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan in a press release on Saturday demanded that the police department withdraw cases filed against two party workers. Kalyan alleged that police were harassing party workers by filing false cases against them.

“I strongly condemn harassment against Tadepalligudem leaders Bolisetty Srinivas and Marisetty Pavan Balaji by local MLA Sri Kottu Satyanarayana who instigated the police. Apart from taking Balaji to the police station, a false case has been filed against him for criticising the ruling party legislators,” Kalyan said.

“We decry the way police personnel behaved with former municipal chairman Bolisetty Srinivas when he went to the police station to question the false arrest,” Kalyan said, adding that the police acted with bias and urging the police to withdraw the cases.

399,['19/01/2020'],Hunters of the lost recipe,"This story is from January 19, 2020

BENGALURU: Shivakotiacharya is believed to have been the author of Vaddaradhane – the earliest extant prose work in the Kannada language. It’s dated around 900 BC. It’s mainly concerned with the stories of Jain saints, but it also contains one of the earliest recipes for the idli. The dosa, the other south Indian staple, finds references in Tamil Nadu’s Sangam literature. A 12th century Sanskrit encyclopaedia, the Abhilashitartha Chintamani, compiled by the Kalyani Chalukya king Someshvara III, provides recipes for the vada. Folk tales tie the origin of rasam to an ailing Pandya prince and sambar to the Marathas in South India.

But for every dish and recipe that has survived centuries, you can’t help but wonder about all the recipes that have been lost – or remain unconsciously secret. And for some people, tracking these recipes is profession and passion.

Not just nostalgia

More than three years ago, when chef Regi Mathew sat down with this childhood friends John Paul and Augustine Kurian in Chennai to discuss setting up a restaurant focussed on Kerala cuisine, the conversation veered toward food that they had growing up. The food that they’d had during their childhood days, they realised, wasn’t being made anymore – at least, not in restaurants.

The discussion would set Mathew, Paul and Kurian out on a three-and a-half-year long journey across the length and breadth of Kerala. Today, the culinary discoveries made by the trio have found their home in the menu of their restaurant, the Kappa Chakka Kandhari, located in Bengaluru and Chennai.

For chef Mathew, research into Kerala’s forgotten recipes began at home. “When I decided to do this, the idea wasn’t only about looking at recipes, for me it was really about telling stories of these recipes. We then asked our mothers to connect us to ten of their friends who they thought were great cooks,” says Mathew. This meant visiting 30 homes set across Kerala to start with. Mathew ended up meeting 267 housewives totally. “These ammachis didn’t see us as strangers, they saw us as sons of their friends. They opened up their kitchens to us,” The road trip helped Regi discover culinary secrets of the various Keralite communities. “In Malabar, we learnt the Moplah cuisine, in Palakkad it was Iyer food, Thripaiyar introduced us to Namboothiri cuisine, Thrissur-Syrian Christian food, in Kochi, we discovered Jewish and Portuguese inspired food and so on,” says Mathew. The husbands of the housewives opened up too. “They started suggesting dishes and recommending toddy shops they thought we had to visit,” says Mathew. In Kerala, where toddy shops litter the alleys and bylanes of small towns and villages, it is the food served more than the toddy that sets each one apart.

‘You will need four or five stomachs’

Travel and food writers Priya Ganapathy and Anurag Mallick had a similar experience when they were roped in by Total Environment to research and document regional cuisine of Karnataka and curate the menu for the restaurant Oota Bangalore in Whitefield. The journey would see them travel over 20,000 kms within in the state for two and a half years, with chefs (Chef Manjit Singh and Chef Suresh Venkatramana). “We would set out every two months to do it and to make it easy for us, we mapped the state into five main regions: North Karnataka, south Karnataka, Coorg-Malnad, Coastal Karnataka and Udupi ,” says Ganapathy.

The idea behind this journey was to discover and rediscover less-known, and in some cases, lost recipes that were indigenous to the state. “We covered 25 communities overall. And through the course of this journey, we learnt that there are so many sects and subsects and each of them had their own culinary specifications,” says Ganapathy. Mallick adds, “Almost every community we met had cuisines specific to occasions. There are regional, seasonal, festive and marriage cuisines.” The culinary road trip was an endless source of stories of food memories and trivia. Like when Ganapathy laughs and says, “The Havyaka community, which is vegetarian, blew our minds off in terms of how much variety they have. A huge number of dishes are served in their weddings, so much so that you will need four to five stomachs to eat it all!”

NEW DISHES UNCOVERED

The Ramaserri idli is one of the best-selling dishes in Kappa Chakka Kandhari. Chef Regi Mathew says, “I didn’t know much about the Ramaserri idli, so asked an uncle to take me there. When we went there, I saw that it was just two streets with two shops. And it is one family that makes it.” Mathew has two brothers from the original family working with him today. “Another dish I learnt was when I visited the tribal people living in the Agasthiyar mountains. They cook a fish dish which is made with gooseberry, kandhari chilli. The fish is smeared with these sparse ingredients and grilled on a hot river stone.” That dish, Mathew says inspired him to experiment with gooseberry masala,” he says.

“In our 20,000 km journey we cooked unusual fare with various communities – like Sukki Bhakdi and Sangolli roti with kaaso bhajji/aamey soppu (fiddlehead fern) with Siddi tribals at Kalleshwara, Halakki meen saaru (spicy fish curry) with Halakkis at Ankola, besides tasting countless more,” say Ganapathy and Mallick.

401,['19/01/2020'],UGC seeks report on alleged irregularities,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Manjula Shroff

AHMEDABAD: The University Grants Commission ( UGC ) has sought a report from the state government after a committee set up by the state education department highlighted irregularities in Calorx Teachers’ University, which was renamed Sabarmati University , in issuing PhD and MPhil degrees. The state education department has also ordered a forensic financial audit of the university, top sources said.

TOI, Ahmedabad, in it’s January 18, 2019, edition, had highlighted that the state government has issued a show-cause notice to the university’s after a three-member committee found irregularities in the way the university had issued PhD and MPhil degrees, by violating key UGC guidelines.

Principal secretary, higher education, Anju Sharma said, “We will soon send the report on our findings to the UGC. We will wait for instructions from the UGC on what steps are to be taken against the university. We are taking this issue very seriously.”

Sources said that the government received complaints that the university has issued nearly 1,500 PhDs and 800-odd MPhil degrees, to students outside Gujarat, in a very short period of time.

Complaints against the university included violation of UGC norms such as awarding PhDs in less than three years, passing off internal guides as external guides, taking PhD students without an entrance test and even ‘selling’ doctoral degrees to students from other states.

After the state education department issued a show-cause notice to the university, asking it to furnish details the degrees awarded, the UGC sought a report from the government.

The state government has also decided to undertake a financial forensic audit of the university. The government on Saturday, tasked chartered accountant Jainik Vakil with conducting the audit and reporting within 30 days.

Last known, the university was governed by the Kalorex Foundation, headed by Manjula Pooja Shroff who also managed the Delhi Public School at Hebatpur, known as DPS (East). A couple of months ago, the school lost its CBSE affiliation after it provided land on its campus to Nithyananda for setting up an ashram .

No clarity: Who actually runs the university now?

Ahmedabad: There is ambiguity over who actually runs the Calorx Teachers’ University, now remaned Sabarmati University. Sources said that lately, the management of the university had been handed over to a politician from Haryana and the university’s affairs were being managed by him. This, however, could not be independently verified.

The Kalorx Group claimed that Manjula Pooja Shroff has not been part of the university governing board for several years now.

“The Sabarmati University (formerly Calorx Teachers University) is an autonomous statutory entity under the Gujarat Private Universities Act, 2009, functions independently and carries day to day operations and management on its own... Manjula Pooja Shroff has not been part of the university governing body for past several years,” a statement from the Kalorx Group said.

Sources in the Kalorx Group which runs the DPS schools in the city, said that the university was managed by Hiten Vasant, a former trustee. However, Vasant rebutted these claims.

“I am not associated with the Calorx Teachers’ University. I have no idea about any irregularity in the university,” said Vasant.

Earlier, the Calorx Teachers’ University courted controversy when it sacked its registrar, Shailendra Gupta, after its inquiry committee found him to be involved in irregularities. Sources said that this had led the university management to change its name to Sabarmati University.

How to reach:

Legend has it:

Flora and Fauna:

Dhutpapeshwar temple, a tiny remote village nestled in the lap of the Konkan ranges, is bestowed with the best of nature. If you have a thing for heritage and would not mind all that nature has to offer, plan a trip to this place in the next weekend for a veritable treat.Located in Dhopeshwar village, Dhutpapeshwar temple is hardly 8km away from Rajapur town in Ratnagiri district and 115km away from Kolhapur city. It takes around three hours to reach the place. Since it is situated in the interiors of the Konkan, one will get to enjoy breathtaking views of the Sayhadri during the journey. One will have to take the Kolhapur—Gagan Bawda route and then take a right at Kale village. From here, one has to travel via Anuskura ghat, Pachal, Vatul, Oni, Rajapur and Diwtewadi to reach Dhopeshwar village. The roads in the Dhopeshwar village are a bit confusing so it is advisable to use GPS to access the location of the temple.The temple here is believed to be around 400-years-old. Shyam Hirdekar, a priest at the temple said, “The place hosts two temples of Lord Shiva and Lord Datta in close vicinity. In between these two temples is the Mrudani river, which flows down the mountains as a waterfall, creating a scenic view beside the temple. The temple architecture is beautifully carved on wood and basalt rock and is believed to be built in the early 17th century, after a local villager spotted a Shivling here. A Nagarkhana (entrance arch) and a few other small temples also can be found in the premises along with a coloured Deepstambh. A large number of people visit this temple during Mahashivratri and in the month of Shravan”.Famous among environmentalists as an ecological hotspot, Dhopeshwar in Rajapur hosts many rare species of flora and fauna in its surroundings. Umakant Chavan, an environment researcher said, “Dhopeshwar boasts of verdant beauty. The rural Konkani life here is an experience of its own. One can find many medicinal plants here. Trees like areka, teak, banyan, mango, konkam, cashew and ficus can be found here aplenty. Given the greenery here, a variety of birds have made this place their natural habitat.”",kolhapur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73370825,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-725311,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/this-temple-in-konkan-offers-a-veritable-treat/articleshow/73363525.cms

COIMBATORE: The DMK is all set to stage a protest in the city on January 31 to condemn the civic body’s bad upkeep of civic infrastructure such as roads, stormwater drains , street lights and cremation grounds and mark its opposition to set up waste segregation plants in public spaces near residential areas and handing over of 27x7 drinking water supply rights to the French private firm Suez India Pvt Ltd.

DMK MLA from Singanallur N Karthik in a communication said either the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD) or the city corporation should come forward to manage the 24x7 water distribution system, instead of entrusting the same to a private firm. “Despite opposition from the opposition parties and other organizations, the city corporation has not revoked the agreement with the private firm. This is condemnable,” he said.

The DMK legislator also flayed the civic body’s move to set up waste segregation facilities in parks and paly grounds near residential areas. This, he said, would cause stench and lead to fly and mosquito menace, risking the health of residents. “These facilities should be set up away from residential areas,” he said.

Pointing out that stormwater drains in the city have not been desilted for long, he said they were clogged with trash and that water was overflowing.

Karthik also said roads that were dug up in several areas for underground drainage work and other construction works were in a bad shape, causing inconvenience to commuters and pedestrians. “In addition, old roads are yet to be relaid.”

Referring to the bad state of cremation grounds, he said they were filled with thick vegetation. “At least 87 cremation grounds that are spread across five zones of the city are not maintained properly. Then there are dysfunctional streetlights. The civic body’s performance in smart city projects is also lackadaisical. So, we have decided to protest against the city corporation,” the DMK MLA said.

The Thousand Lights all-women police in Chennai on Saturday arrested a Coimbatore-based businessman for cheating a divorcee hailing from Hyderabad of Rs 27 lakh after promising to marry her.

A police team nabbed R Rajan Naidu from a hideout at his friend’s house in Tiruchi. “He had contacted the victim, Umarani, 42, through a matrimonial website. He expressed desire to marry her as soon as possible and told her that he had suffered some business setbacks. He requested her to lend him some money to get rid of the debt, so that they could lead a peaceful married life,” a police officer said.

After receiving about Rs 27 lakh within a period of two months, Naidu began to avoid her. He turned off his mobile phone and stopped replying to her mails. Realising that she had been cheated, Umarani lodged a police complaint.

Based on her complaint, police registered a case against Naidu under sections 420 (cheating),406 (criminal breach of trust),417 (punishment for cheating) and 506(1) (criminal intimidation). The cops traced his whereabouts by tracking his mobile phone. He was brought to Chennai and remanded in judicial custody.

BAGESHWAR: Incumbent BJP government and the opposition Congress are “misleading the people” on district level development authority, according to members of Pradhikaran Hatao Morcha in Bageshwar on Saturday.

Accusing the two national parties of blame game on imposing the development authority at a news conference, the Morcha members alleged that “none of the political parties are serious about repealing it entirely”. The Morcha has now asked the government to issue a white paper at the earliest to clarify the matter.

The latest press conference was called after a statement was reported in the media of Congress leader and former chief minister Harish Rawat , who was in Bageshwar to take part in ‘Uttarayani’ fair. Rawat had reportedly said, “If BJP proves that the development authority was brought during the Congress rule, then I will leave politics, or else the BJP should not contest the 2022 elections for such baseless allegations.”

Pramod Mehta, president of Pradhikaran Hatao Morcha Bageshwar, said, “Both the parties know that this law is unpopular in the hills. It would snatch away the rights of the people of their lands. Therefore, both are trying to mislead the people by accusing each other of implementing it.”

“Our demand is that the government should issue a white paper at the earliest to clarify the situation and the district level development authority for hill areas should be repealed immediately,” said Pankaj Pandey, secretary of Pradhikaran Hatao Morcha Bageshwar.

Last year, in Bageshwar, two people allegedly committed suicide to protest against the district development authority. Since then, opposition to the development authority has intensified.

NAGPUR: Aviation and aeronautics are the fields that need to be tapped by youngsters as there are plenty of opportunities to make a career, said Ujjwal Thengdi, director of ABC Aviation Business Consultancy, on Friday.

He was speaking at a programme organized by Branovative Marketing Company to create awareness about aeronautics, at Sai Sabhagruh, Shankar Nagar.

Thengdi urged the parents to let their child learn aeronautics and aviation as there is a lot of scope in those fields. Very few people know that a lot of vacancies exist for want of trained professionals, he added.

Ramesh Joshi, an aero-modeller and aeronautics instructor, said youngsters should choose these fields as the job offers a lot of money. Salaries of pilots and aeronautics engineers are handsome. Importantly, it is a challenging job youngsters should take up, he said.

As part of awareness programme, students trained by Joshi demonstrated various aero designs and models. Maheshwar Dhone, a student of Std X, showcased his skills on an indoor aero-model designed by him.

Nishant Gedam, one of Joshi’s students, has been recognized by Russian designers and is getting ready for International Boeing Competition.

Ronnie Gaigole was present.

KRISHNAGIRI: The Prohibition Enforcement Wing (PEW) officials on Saturday thwarted an attempt to smuggle spirit to Kerala through the district from Haryana with the arrest of two people from Andhra Pradesh . They also seized 20,000 litres of spirit worth Rs 20 lakh and the truck used for smuggling.

According to district superintendent of police (SP) Bandi Gangadhar, PEW officials got a tip that some miscreants were planning to smuggle spirit to the neighbouring state through the district. Subsequently, a team led by DSP Murali was deployed for vehicle check at Jujuwadi check post on Bengaluru-Chennai national highway.

Bareilly: Local authorities in Sambhal have issued recovery notice of Rs 2.45 lakh to a boy claimed to be just 17 years old. A resident of Miyan Sarai locality under Kotwali police station limits, the boy’s poverty-stricken family has no land and little source of income to pay the recovery amount. The notice has been served to his mother. Notably, as many as 70 people in Sambhal have been issued recovery notices for damages caused to public property during the anti-CAA protests in December.

The boy, whose father died a few years ago, is the sole breadwinner of the family. His uncle told TOI that he works as a tailor in a jeans factory and supports his mother and three siblings – two sisters aged 7 and 8 and a 14-year-old brother.

The family has no money to engage a lawyer.

“He did not participate in the protest but the police framed him under false charges. He barely earns Rs 250 a day to make both ends meet. His family has no means to afford a mobile phone. I have no idea how he would be able to pay Rs 2.45 lakh,” his uncle said.

Local advocate Mumtaj Ansari, who voluntary came forward to help the minor boy, said, “They are such a downtrodden family that they hardly get two square meals every day. Burden to feed four members of his family is on this boy’s tiny shoulders. They have no property except a ramshackle one-room house. The recovery notice issued in his name is completely wrong. We will put the evidence before the authorities to prove that he was not involved in any arson and rioting.”

The notice issued by additional district magistrate Kamlesh Kumar Awasthi said that the boy indulged in damaging nine motorbikes and two buses. When contacted, Awasthi told TOI, “It is difficult to tell the payable amount mentioned in each recovery notice or the age of the recipient. I will have to check to be able to comment on this.”

416,['19/01/2020'],"Sorry, but such negative news ruins our morning","This story is from January 19, 2020

Is this the way you want us to start the day?” an angry middle-aged woman shouted over the phone, marking the beginning of our working day. The telephone had already passed three pairs of hands. Those were days when social media hadn’t consumed us and the telephone was a key feedback source.

The caller disapproved of the number of crime reports on the front page . “Isn’t there any other important event happening in this vast country?” she said. “Around me I see bright successful students and professionals; I see crowds at festive events; playing, dancing, singing, laughing… And you guys seem to revel in telling us about the most depressing and outrageous incidents. That’s so vicarious…”

We knew she wasn’t entirely wrong and promised to look at the sunny side of things. The other complaint we tactfully ignored was that such news triggered “more harm than good to society”. What could we say to this sweeping contention when in fact we felt as heavy-hearted?

The protestations weren’t new. Even in the late 1970s, activists in the US cited the annual “violence profiles” for network programming done by Annenberg School of Communications (University of Pennsylvania) showing that images of violence were increasing, and among the chief contributors were the weekend cartoons. This, despite the practice in 1975 of messages flashed across screens about exercising parental viewing guidance. Those were also days when some dailies – mostly the evening papers – threw in a couple of sensational headlines to attract “street sales.” It wasn’t uncommon to see hawkers at traffic junctions shout out ear-grabbing headlines.

Studies across the world have held that regular coverage of violence in the media – television in particular – can have an adverse effect on viewers and readers. They say the young become more aggressive and de-sensitised to violence in real life; they don’t see other options in dealing with day-to-day issues; the weaker among them become paranoid and shy away from facing difficult situations, while some others imitate the violence they have seen. When adolescents are completely out of touch with reality, they fail to apply knowledge and awareness. Above all, the bloodshed can devalue the quality of life of adults as well. And in times when we are increasingly relying on the audio-visual medium, emotional as well as intellectual responses can suffer. In a telling – perhaps even a bit alarming – warning as far back as in 1995, professor Barry Sanders wrote in “A is for Ox: The Collapse of Literacy and the Rise of Violence in an Electronic Age” that the oral tradition of learning is lost in the television age. That’s because there’s no conversational mode in this process and images flit by too fast for better comprehension or analysis. Given this medium, and its tools of zoom, montage, abrupt cuts, panorama shots plus sound effects and music, producers could dramatize issues as much as they wished to. Newspapers, of course, haven’t faced so much flak. With readers becoming more and more mindful, mainstream dailies offer in-depth analysis, backgrounders and graphics with relevant stats that don’t make “negative news” sound melodramatic. The exceptions could come on a rare day when reports of violence hog space on the news pages.

One has to mind the photos though – those that are gory and show bodily injury in graphic detail, or simply capture corpses in cold blood are out, no matter how grim the incident is. Most dailies honour this code. As if in a gentle reminder, Kannada writer Jayant Kaikini had written a thoughtful piece many years ago on the need to shield our children from exposure to ghastly and repulsive visuals. “We need humans, not bodies inhabiting our pages…” he said. So how much good news can we cram in, every day? Would cynics, critics, rivals, competitors and the opposition parties have their own role in casting dark shadows on news developments? Do news gatherers have a fascination with the morose?

Experimental psychologist Steven Pinker says journalists have their own moral calculations; they believe it’s their responsibility to look at aspects that spell danger, threat, risk, corruption and such negativity. Which prompts the question: Aren’t they only reflecting the mood around us? At the Times literature festival in Mumbai two years ago, Pinker said, “Whether or not the world really is getting worse, the nature of news will interact with the nature of cognition to make us think that it is.” The path to being truthful here would involve being “factful”. That would mean consistent supply of data of quality of life indicators like crime and pollution.

The catch comes when data might point to a dip in incidence of crime and before you say acche din, the neighbourhood might be shaken with a horrible murder. A concerned reader would promptly call and tell us how absurd our claim is: “You mean the crime rate has fallen? And only alongside you have reported this brutal double murder…”

Bijnor: Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) district president Digambar Singh and scores of farmers were booked for allegedly misbehaving with the executive engineer of Power Corporation on Saturday. According to police, farmers led by the BKU district president “interfered in government work” and misbehaved with the official while staging a protest two days ago.

Farmers on Thursday had laid siege to executive engineer’s office to press for redressal of their grievances including frequent power disruptions, dilapidated state of power lines and wrong power bills. A group of farmers also took executive engineer RP Singh hostage.

When the power officer allegedly refused to resolve their problems, Digambar Singh threatened to block the railway track, but officials somehow stopped farmers from doing so.

Executive officer RP Singh alleged, “More than 150 farmers led by BKU’s Digambar Singh staged a dharna outside my office. They were pressing for an illegal demand, which I cannot fulfill. They were forcing me to let off two persons accused of power theft. When I said no, they misbehaved with me. They even threatened to put me on the railway track in front of a train if I did not fulfill their demands. I have uploaded all the videos on social platform on Friday.”

Singh added, “All my colleagues came to support me. All executive engineers and SDOs met superintendent of police Sanjeev Tyagi on Friday. In addition, we met district magistrate Ramakant Pandey on Saturday and told him that we are unable to work in such an atmosphere of imminent threat. I have expressed my fears for life. The DM assured us appropriate action in this regard.”

Thereafter, police registered an FIR against BKU’s district president Digambar Singh, its leaders Devdatt Sharma, Ankit Kumar and Surendra Sharma and others.

RC Sharma, Bijnor SHO, said, “An FIR has been registered against unnamed farmers and four named accused including Digambar Singh for disrupting government work and misbehaving with executive engineer RP Singh during the protest staged two days ago.”

Soon after the FIR was lodged against BKU leaders, national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait of the outfit lashed out at the power officials and said, “BKU never misbehaves with any official. Our outfit voices grievances of farmers. Two days ago, farmers had staged a dharna for replacing old wires, that posed a danger to all here. There were some other problems of farmers related to electricity. Power officials do not want to work. When our district president and farmers asked them to work honestly, they leveled false allegations against farmers to hide their inaction. We stand with the farmers and our workers and will talk to higher authorities over the issue.”

Sources warned that farmers are facing a lot of problems and may resort to further agitation if the grievances are not attended to.

CBI

HYDERABAD: Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan of the Telangana high court on Saturday threatened to order a CBI inquiry against the state police for detaining people unlawfully in various cases. Hearing an urgent plea at his home on Saturday afternoon after Osmania University professor, Ch Kaseem was arrested, the chief justice ordered police chiefs of Hyderabad and Siddipet to produce the professor at his residence by 10.30 am on Sunday. He also wondered if cops had informed the vice-chancellor before entering the university campus.

The plea was moved by professor Gaddam Laxman, president of the Telangana Civil Liberties Committee. Giving details of the raid on Kaseem’s house, Laxman alleged that the police not only detained him but also stopped students and colleagues from meeting him. Laxman’s counsel V Raghunath said that they feared the police may plant material at Kaseem’s house to link him to Maoists and feared that the police may harm him.

Telangana’s special counsel Harender Pershad told the Chief Justice that Kaseem had been absconding since the case was registered against him in 2016 and that he would be produced before a magistrate in Gajwel. The state also claimed that though the case was registered in 2016, the investigating officers have found more evidence now.

Hearing the case along with Justice A Abhishek Reddy, the Chief Justice was critical of the police resorting to unlawful detentions and sought to know if they had got permission from the Osmania University vice-chancellor before entering the campus.

While the petitioners claim that no one was informed about the raid, police officials claimed that they had informed the registrar.

“A professor who is conducting classes for the last four years is now shown as absconding,” the Chief Justice said. “This is unbelievable. You are doing this in many cases. If you do not produce him before us by tomorrow morning, we may have to think in terms of entrusting the matter to CBI. We did so in Rajasthan in the past.”

The Chief Justice also wondered about the reasons behind the urgency to raid an academician’s house now when the case was four years old. “Has the detenue failed to respond to your notices? Did you give him any notice in the first place?” Justice Chauhan asked. The case will be heard again at CJ ’s residence on Sunday morning.

KANNUR: The legal process as part of the trial in the murder of Youth Congress leader S P Shuhaib has begun and the preliminary trial would be held on February 19 at the additional district sessions court in Thalassery.

The court, which considered the case on Saturday, asked all the accused to appear before the court on that day. On Saturday, only three accused came to the court.

There are a total of 17 accused in the case, all CPM workers. One of the accused sought permission of the high court to go abroad following which the HC ordered that the trial should be completed in six months.

It was on the night of February 12, 2018 that Shuhaib was attacked with swords when he was having tea at a tea shop at Therur near Edayannur, in the suburbs of Mattannur. He succumbed to the injuries during the early hours of February 13 on the way to the hospital.

Ever since the murder of Shuhaib, the Congress has been demanding that a CBI probe should be ordered in the case, alleging that CPM leadership was protecting the real killers and the people who conspired the murder.

Though the family had moved the high court seeking CBI probe in the case, the court rejected it in August 2019. However, the family of the slain youth has moved the Supreme Court demanding CBI probe. The plea is pending with the apex court to hear the stand of the state government, which also opposed the CBI probe, they said. “Whatever it may be we will fight till we get justice and the case is handed over to the CBI,” said Shuhaib’s father C P Muhammed.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Although the city police are keen on upgrading the women police station in the Port City as the ‘Disha Police Station’, a section of senior officials admitted that they are still unaware of the standard operating procedure (SOP) under the Disha Act .

“It’s a special Act and we can only book sensitive cases under this Act. However, we are not sure about SOP under this act. To be honest, we are trying to find out the basics such as whether an inspector-rank official can file cases under the Act or whether if it has to be an IPS-ranked official,” a senior police official from the city police force told TOI.

Officials said that a special team from the Crime Investigations Department (CID) has been entrusted the task of designing the SOP for cases filed under the Disha Act.

“We are expecting SOP soon. One thing is clear: Cases under Disha Act need to be investigated within a very short time,” a police officer said.

According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report for 2017, with 17,909 cases of crime against women recorded, Andhra Pradesh topped the shame list among south Indian states.

Meanwhile, the city police have drawn up a blueprint for the infrastructure of the Disha Police Station planned at the police complex at Yendada crossing on NH-16.

According to officials, the station will have a childcare room, a counselling centre and separate chambers for sub-inspectors. A lady police official would be in-charge of the station.

The complex will also house the PM Palem Police Station, a few traffic stations and the office of ACP Madhurawada. The office of the city police commissioner is likely to be moved into the new complex. The staff strength of Disha Police Station will be increased and officials handling cases under Disha Act will get a pay hike of 30 per cent.

425,['19/01/2020'],City’s real estate market booms in capital hope,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Enquiries for land and flats in Vizag and surrounding areas has spiked within the first week of January. The recent interest follows chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy’s proposal to make Vizag the executive capital of AP.

According to reports, people from various parts of the state, as well as from other parts of the country are exhibiting interest in procuring property in the city at the moment. Consequently, the real estate market is witnessing a boom with a price hike of 15% to 25%.

Vizag was a real estate hotspot even in united Andhra Pradesh. Now, with the executive capital proposal in the horizon, the city’s real estate market is getting some of its lost glory back.

The last few years were not great for the city’s real estate market. First, demonetisation and then the sand crisis made the real estate market suffer. But the executive capital proposal seems to be helping it recover.

During a recent property show hosted by Credai (Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India), Vizag chapter, each builder sold between six to seven units.

“No builder sold less than five units. Investors are awaiting an official announcement from the government. Once the announcement comes, the number of investors will rise further,” said Credai president Srinivasa Rao.

According to Rao, a section of people are still reluctant to invest because it is still doubtful if the proposal will become a reality, especially with agitations going on in Amaravati.

He expects real estate firms from outside the state to land up in the city as well once the official announcement is made.

According to a market survey, areas like Madhurawada, Kommadi, Tagarapuvalasa, Rushikonda, Bheemili, Yendada. PM Palem and Anandapuram are in high demand.

Speaking to TOI, a realtor said that investors are asking about villas, luxurious flats, beachside property as well as property in gated communities. The realtor said that the city has the potential of great return on investment.

“Moreover, the city is well connected to other regions in the state as well as to other states through rail, road and air connectivity,” the realtor added.

The price of open plots has increased by nearly Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 per square yard in the outskirts.

Meanwhile, flats in the outskirts are competing in terms of price with those in the city. While the average price of flats in the city is between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000 per square foot, in Yendada and Rushikonda, the prices are touching Rs 4,500 to Rs 4,700.

The price per square foot in Madhurawada has gone up from around Rs 3,200 per square foot to Rs 3,800 per square foot.

Moreover, a large number of apartments in the suburbs are ready for occupation in Tagarapuvalasa on the Srikakulam route to Kurmannapalem on the Anakapalli route.

According to builder K Ramaraju, people with a budget of Rs 40 lakh can easily find decent two-bedroom homes, while those seeking three-bedroom homes in the outskirts will have to shell out Rs 60 lakh to Rs 70 lakh.

429,['19/01/2020'],"VPT sets ball rolling on cruise terminal, berth","This story is from January 19, 2020

Vijayawada: More than a year after announcing its plans to set up a berth to handle cruise ships, the port of Visakhapatnam has set the ball rolling on making the berth into a reality by inviting and approving the design of the berth and a cruise terminal, PL Haranadh, deputy chairman of the Visakhapatnam Port Trust said recently.

“IIT-Madras has designed the berth while the Mumbai-based Creative Group has designed the terminal for the cruise berth. We are now waiting for the Environmental Assessment Report (EIA), which is being prepared by one of VPT’s approved vendors. The EIA report is expected by end-March,” Haranadh told TOI by phone.

He said VPT will be building the cruise berth in the channel. “We will be rebuilding an existing general cargo berth into the cruise terminal. VPT decided to build a berth for cruise ships based on the potential for cruise ships at all major ports in the county projected by EY, a consulting firm,” he said.

The cruise berth and terminal is estimated to cost Rs 77 crore. “The ministry of tourism will be funding 50% of the cost of the berth and terminal, while VPT will be funding the balance of 50%,” Haranadh said. VPT will build the berth.

“We expect to begin the construction of the berth early in the next financial year,” he said.

Former VPT chairman MT Krishna Babu had said in December 2018 that the berth was expected to be commissioned within two years of getting all the approvals.

The berth would be 180 metres in length and have two mooring dolphins on either side to berth cruise vessels of a length of 300 metres with a draft of 8.1 metres.

The cruise terminal would have a back up area of 15,000 square metres, internal roads, sewer, water supply facilities, drainage system, parking lots, illuminated area, along with a built up area of 200 square metres, installed with CCTV cameras, rest rooms, central air-conditioning, duty free shops, foreign currency exchange counters and offices of tourism and travel operators.

Meanwhile, Haranadh said, the port expects to register a total cargo throughput of a record 70 million tonnes (mt) in 2019-20, against a target of 68 mt. “We have been witnessing good growth in all the cargos we handle, so VPT could cross a cargo throughput of 70 mt,” he said.

Asked what VPT was doing about leasing out its surplus land in Visakhapatnam city, Haranadh said the port was focussing on increasing its cargo handling capacity. “Currently, the port is designed to handle 126 mt of cargo. Once our expansion program is completed, the capacity will be increased to 148 mt, which we believe will be sufficient to handle cargo for many more years into the future,” he said. “VPT will take up the development of every inch of surplus land in the city after the port expansion plan is completed,” he added.

Beautification at Jinsi intersection, for which BMC sanctioned Rs 88 lakh, while middle of the road is marked ... Read More

BHOPAL: In a shocking waste of public money, the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Bhopal Smart City Development Corporation Limited ( BSCDCL ) are undertaking 'city beautification' works in areas marked for the Metro rail construction.

BMC corporators are out to impress the public, as election for the municipal council is expected to be held in the next few months. The term of the current elected council ends in February. Over the last two months, tenders for projects worth over Rs 50 crore have been cleared.

The cash-strapped BMC, which is finding it hard to pay salaries on time, has undertaken construction and beautification works in Jehangirabad, TT Nagar, MP Nagar and other areas marked for phase one of Metro rail construction. Total cost of the projects is estimated to be in crores.

For over six months, survey teams are on the ground marking out areas for Metro rail development. However, BMC city engineer PK Jain and local officials, claimed to be unaware of the specifics. For instance, the area along Jinsi, is marked for Metro rail construction. It is also the area where the main Metro depot would be developed.

The BMC, on its part, has redeveloped the Jinsi intersection. The middle of the road is marked for development of the Metro rail flyover. On this track, two Metro rail lines would meet. For over a month now, BMC has undertaken renovation of the middle of the road. A sum of Rs 88 lakh has been sanctioned for beautification and Rs 8 lakh for new streetlights. The tender was approved recently.

BMC city engineer PK Jain and zone official RK Saxena, claimed they were unaware of the specifics of Metro rail development. ""Metro will take a few years for construction. For now, this is what the public needed. The project was sanctioned two years ago. Money for development was approved only recently,"" said BMC ward corporator, leader of Opposition and local Congress leader, Mohammed Sagheer.

Reacting to the situation, Bhopal mayor and local BJP leader Alok Sharma, said, ""There is a need for coordination between agencies. BMC commissioner, Bhopal collector and Bhopal divisional commissioner should undertake an immediate review so that public money is not wasted.""

The Metro development plan was released in public domain in 2016. Since then, numerous surveys have been undertaken in coordination with BMC. Other instances of development that would be overrun by the Metro rail development is construction in the middle of the road along PHQ, Rangmahal area, ICCC cameras and some others.

Mumbai: Three large trees are proposed to be cut at Bandra to widen Hill Road. BMC had widened a large portion of the stretch towards Bandra station. Environmentalists pointed out that there are large trees on several roads in the city, with traffic moving smoothly.

The civic body has sought public suggestions/objections by January 23 for the trees opposite St Andrew's Church. Activist Zoru Bhathena said that when he saw the notice on BMC's website, he inspected the site. ""Bandra is full of hawkers and there's double-parking by cars.

Why can't the same be done here?"" he asked.

Corporator Asif Zakeria said Bhathena had brought this to his notice. ""I have spoken to BMC officials and told Bhathena to visit the site along with us. If the road can be widened by retaining the trees, it will work well for everyone,"" said Zakeria.

A garden department official (H west ward) said the trees are only proposed to be cut, and they have invited suggestions/objections. ""A decision will be taken based on feedback,"" said an official.

Bhathena also pointed out that since this year, 777 trees have been proposed to be removed by BMC across the city for infrastructure and development projects. It includes widening of roads and construction of bridges.

Hope is what matters to parents and all cancer survivors,"" says Vansh, who is in Class IX and loves playing football. His determination has seen him win awards in education, sport and even dance.

SI Narendra Belwanshi said that complainant Ravindrapal Singh retired from BHEL. In his complaint, he stated that his house is located at C-Sector, Indrapuri in Piplani.

Singh's wife Ramwati passed away in 1997 and he has two sons and a daughter. He stayed with his elder son Praveen and his wife Alka. He said that due to old age he has grown weak with failed vision.

SI Belwanshi said that Singh had filed a complaint in the CM's Helpline a few days back. When he brought him to the police station, he was so weak that he could not even walk 10 steps. He requested police to take stern legal action against his son and daughter-in-law and help him get back the possession of his house.

JHARGRAM: Elephants have killed four men — two each in Jhargram and West Midnapore districts — in as many days since Wednesday night.

Subhash Mahato of Jhargram’s Meherban village was trampled by an elephant on Wednesday night while returning home after cremating a relative at the local burning ghat. Early on Thursday, Monoranjan Mahato of Jhargram’s Manikpara was trampled while returning home after seeing off a relative at Banstala railway station.

On Friday evening, Shibu Hembram of Ghuchisol village in West Midnapore’s Anandapur was attacked by an elephant while returning from work. Locals said it lifted him with its trunk and threw him to the ground.

On Saturday morning, Kalipada Mahato of Jharnada-nga village died in West Midnapore’s Salboni after an elephant from a 35-strong herd from Dalma strayed in. He had stepped out of home early in the morning to answer nature’s call. The elephant spotted him, lifted him with its trunk and flung him to the ground. It also damaged his house.

Midnapore additional divisional forest officer Purabi Mahato said: “We are taking several steps to curb the menace. Our teams, though, face problems during such drives to chase elephants. This results in them changing routes. We are also compensating villagers whose crops have been damaged. And, the practice of compensation to the next of kin of anyone killed by an elephant is long-standing.”

Jagdeep Dhankhar

KOLKATA: Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has reacted strongly to education minister Partha Chatterjee’s jibe at him and his wife over their “PR exercise” in government programmes while targeting the state gover-nment, particularly the education department.

Dhankhar said the minister should “think before he speaks out”.

Chatterjee had said on Wednesday: “The governor and his wife seem to be in a PR exercise. I have all regard for the governor and his wife. We have never asked why anybody other than the governor should be present at government programmes. I have never seen Gopalkrishna Gandhi doing it. Neither did I see M K Narayanan or Keshari Nath Tripathi doing it.”

“The minister is terribly wrong. That’s a perverted concept. He must learn the sensitive aspect of this. The CM of this state is a lady. He needs to look within. I will appeal to him to please think before he speaks out,” Dhankhar said, clarifying that the “first lady” doesn’t go where she is not invited.

Jalpaiguri: For the first time in two decades, hispid hare has been spotted in Jaldapara National Park in Alipurduar.

Trap cameras in the forest clicked photos of the floodplain grassland obligate species that was once found in abundance — from Uttar Pradesh to Assam. The animal is now restricted mainly to Assam and Jaldapara and is listed as endangered on IUCN Red List. World population of the species is said to be below 300 individuals.

“Earlier too, hispid hare was spotted in Jaldapara. But it could be documented after many years. This species mainly lives in swampy grasslands,” said Ujjwal Ghosh, chief conservator of forest, wild life, north Bengal.

446,['19/01/2020'],"Rejected by Centre, Kanyashree to take centre stage on Red Rd","This story is from January 19, 2020

Kolkata: Bengal’s Kanyashree tableau will not trundle down New Delhi’s Rajpath this Republic Day, but will definitely roll down the city’s Red Road in all its glory on January 26. It will, in fact, lead the other tableaux at the Red Road parade, a senior official said.

The Centre’s rejection of the tableau showcasing the Mamata Banerjee government’s much-feted direct cash-transfer scheme for girls had caused consternation within the state government with Trinamool ministers accusing the BJP-led central government of being “vindictive”.

By giving the Kanyashree tableau pride of place on Red Road, where both CM Mamata Banerjee and governor Jag-deep Dhankhar will be pres-ent, the state would send across the message that the flagship scheme will not be rejected by the people, a senior minister close to the CM said.

Two other tableaux rejected by the Centre this year — “Jol Dhoro Jol Bhoro” on the state’s water conservation scheme and “Sabuj Sathi” on green schemes — will also be part of the Red Road parade.

In 2018, too, Bengal’s R-Day showpiece of ‘Ektai Sampriti (Unity is Brotherhood) had enjoyed centrestage on Red Road after being denied a presence on Rajpath.

The Centre’s rejection of the Kanyashree tableau — the second time in five years, the first being in 2015 —is particularly galling for the Bengal government as it is one of its most successful social welfare schemes drawing praise both within and outside the country. In 2017, the United Nations honoured ‘Kanyashree’ with its highest public service award, adjudging it the best among 552 social sector schemes from across 62 countries that were nominated for the coveted award.

Conceptualised by the chief minister in 2012, the scheme aims at empowering unmarried girls by helping them fund their education till post-graduation. Since 2013, the government has spent over Rs 5,600 crore on the scheme that has over 61.5 lakh beneficiaries, the officials said.

Yet, the proposed Kanyashree tableau failed to impress the centre’s expert’s committee. While the CM preferred to keep quiet, state parliamentary affairs Tapas Roy linked the rejection to Bengal’s opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act. “Just because we have opposed anti-people laws like CAA, the Centre has rejected our tableau proposal,” Roy said, accusing the centre of “cheap politics”.

Ironically, Bengal which had its proposals rejected in 2015, 2018 and now in 2020, bagged the best tableau prize in 2014 (for showcasing Purulia’s Chhau dance) and in 2016 (for a display on Baul artists).

447,['19/01/2020'],West Bengal: Dilip Ghosh denied entry to Nandigram,"This story is from January 19, 2020

Dilip Ghosh

NANDIGRAM: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh was prevented from taking out a rally in support of the new citizenship law in East Midnapore’s Nandigram on Saturday. Police stopped his car at Reyapara, 10km ahead of Nandigram town on the Chandipur-Nandigram Road.

BJP had organised the “avinandan yatra” as part of its outreach programme in view of the countrywide protests against CAA-NPR-NRC.

Police placed barricades at entry points and closed ferry services since morning, cutting off the entire area. Around 11.30am, a huge police force reached Tengua More and told BJP supporters who had assembled for the yatra that there was no permission to hold the rally. The administration had issued prohibitive orders in the area because of the mounting tension over CAA , the police said.

This soon led to a scuffle as cops pulled the party’s district general secretary by the collar in an effort to disperse the crowd. A section of BJP supporters alleged that police lathicharged the gathering.

Ghosh, who was coming from Kolkata, was stopped at Reyapara citing trouble in Nandigram. He mocked the cops, but didn’t break the police barricade. “The duty of the West Bengal police is to ignore illegal immigrants. I could have broken the police barricade. But I didn’t. Police instead roughed up our party district president and pulled the district general secretary by the collar. They did all these even after our partymen wrote to the SP seeking permission for the rally a fortnight ago. I won’t forget the police assault on our party workers. I will come back to Nandigram and hold the rally,” he said.

Taking a dig at the police, Ghosh said: “It appears that Nandigram is outside India. It seems as if the Constitution doesn’t apply here.”

Trinamool senior and minister Subrata Mukherjee said: “Police will prevent people from holding rallies if they don’t take permission. There have been so many rallies in the state. Police are not stopping them.”

448,['19/01/2020'],"NPR is NRC in disguise, won’t accept rollout: P Chidambaram","This story is from January 19, 2020

P Chidambaram

KOLKATA: Congress leader P Chidambaram has said the BJP government’s talk of the National Population Register (NPR) after the Assam NRC fiasco was nothing but “changing of gears”. “Our purpose is to fight CAA and NPR and mobilise public opinion against them. We will not agree to NPR being rolled out from April 2020,” Chidambaram said in Kolkata on Saturday.

The NPR was introduced by the UPA government in 2010, ahead of Census 2011, and preparation for the pilot project began two years earlier when Chidambaram succeeded Shivraj Patil as home minister. However, Chidambaram drew a distinction between the NPR that was started by UPA and the one being carried out now and termed the current exercise “nothing but NRC in disguise”.

The former home minister said as many as 20 parties had attended the opposition meeting led by Congress president Sonia Gandhi against CAA-NPR-NRC in Delhi. On Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee “going alone” on the issue after giving the meeting a miss, Chidambaram said: “Fighting separately is also a fight... 20 parties attended the meeting and some didn’t. What is important is that we are fighting.”

Speaking after a workshop on CAA for Congress workers, Chidambaram felt that it would not be correct to “miss the larger picture” due to “some intra-state factors” in Bengal. The Congress leader took a jibe at BJP, saying it had failed to gauge the str-ength of the opposition. “We are working with Left parties as well. All parties fighting against CAA and NRC must come together and I am confident that they will,” he said.

The Congress leader reached Kolkata late on Friday and went straight to Park Circus Maidan to show “solidarity” with women protesting against CAA-NRC. “In recent memory, students and youth haven’t come out like this,” Chidambaram said, trying to explain the nation-wide opposition against the new citizenship act. “Generally, students fight for tangible things like rollback of fees, but now they are fighting for intangible ones like freedom and liberalism. I am proud of the students,” he said.

Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Chowdhury, however, took on the Trinamool government for not sending state officials to the NPR meeting called by the census commissioner, when Congress-run governments had sent their representatives. “The meeting was called by the census commissioner. Representatives from Congress-ruled states went to the meeting and expressed their reservations on certain aspects of the NPR exercise. The Bengal government didn’t send its representative to the meeting. That is up to them. But the census commissioner didn’t invite any chief minister to the meeting,” Chowdhury said.

Kolkata: Those who lead scientific institutions must ensure a balance between basic and applied research , director general of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research( CSIR ) Shekhar C Mande said at an HRD ministry-driven leadership for academicians programme. The event was attended by professors of IIT and heads of department of various institutes.

“A basic research that may not appear useful today could be of paramount importance later. Look at ‘Raman effect’, C V Raman’s pioneering work on scattering of light in 1930. At the time, the importance was purely academic. But it turned out to be a significant tool for analysing the composition of liquids, gases and solids. In 1998, it was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society in recognition of its significance,” Mande pointed out, adding that striking a balance between conventional and applied research was of particular importance for a country like India.

All India Council for Technical Education chairman Anil Sahasrabudhe, who also addressed the future leaders of scientific institutions, stressed on the importance of social networking to tap into the alumni resource. “In today’s world, one has to realise the importance of social platform and power of networking to connect with the alumni who can provide support in different ways. For any institute to develop, one needs a pool of scientists. The alumni is a key component of this pool. Not only can they bring in resources, they can also provide a dispassionate assessment of the institute by viewing its functioning from a distance,” he said.

Networking, Sahasrabudhe said, was also necessary to collaborate with industry, corporates and other institutes.

“Exchange of knowledge is key to development, not just between institutes in India but between Indian and international institutes,” he added.

The AICTE chairman also urged laboratories to step forward and become centres to incubate students’ ideas as well as motivate and inspire them. “Give students the opportunity to work in laboratories,” he said.

Representative image

MOHALI: An entire village near Mathura town of Uttar Pradesh underwent a 15-day crash course to learn how to dupe people by using the classifieds website OLX, said police here on Saturday.

The police cracked the online fraud racket while investigating into the September 2019 suicide of a Mohali youth who had bought a phone worth Rs 12,500 on OLX, but committed suicide when he did not get it. Police said an entire team of fraudsters gave the crash course at Shergarh village near Mathura to men aged between 15 and 35, and they were teaching them how to con people by luring them with ads of mobile phones, scooties and cars on OLX.

They were trained in how to convince people into paying money on PayTM. So far, police have arrested brothers Fakruddin (45) and Alam (24), both of whom hail from Shergarh. They were produced in a court here on Saturday and remanded in police custody for five days. Alam is also known as Sandeep and Devanshu, the two aliases which he used to conceal his identity.

The two were arrested on Friday and it is they who told the police about the racket during their interrogation. DSP Sohi said those who provided the training took a one-time fee from the villagers. ""In return, they provided the villagers with fake Aadhaar cards and fake canteen cards of Army jawans to gain the confidence of buyers,"" she said.

Besides, those who trained the youth provided them with mobile phones, OLX app, and operating methods. DSP Sohi said the two brothers had been posting pictures of used mobile phones, cars, scooties and other vehicles ranging between Rs 5,000 and Rs 2.5 lakh on OLX. Once a customer was convinced they were genuine, the accused used to ask him or her to transfer them money through PayTM.

The fraudsters did not put on sale expensive items on purpose as that would have made it difficult for them to attract regular tourists, she said. DSP Sohi said during their preliminary interrogation, the two accused told police that they had created fake IDs with different names on OLX. She said they had received 35 complaints of such type of frauds. DSP said they had seized mobile phones and fake identity cards of Army jawans from the accused.

GURUGRAM: A collision between an auto and a car in Pataudi on the Gurugram-Rewari highway early morning on Saturday killed two, including a minor, and critically injured two others who were travelling in the auto.

Savitri (62) had taken an auto from Rewari for Pataudi with her grandsons, Munesh (15) and Krishan (32), around 5am. It was a foggy morning. About two and a half hours later, the auto was near Pahadi village, minutes from its destination, when a Santro started approaching it from the other side.

“The car was being driven at a very high speed. It ran into the auto, which turned turtle and a part of it got stuck in the divider,” Savitri said in her statement to the police, adding that there was one more passenger in the auto whom she could not identify.

The driver abandoned the car and fled. Munesh and the unidentified passenger died on the spot. Savitri and Krishan were taken to the Pataudi Civil Hospital and are in critical condition. Police do not know much about the accused, how many passengers were in the car and if they were injured. But they have the car’s registration details, with which they are trying to track the accused.

“We have registered an FIR (on the basis of a complaint by Savitri) under sections 304A (causing death by negligence) and 279 (rash driving) of the Indian Penal Code. As of now, we do not know the identity of the accused. We are also trying to identify the fourth victim,” said Suresh Kumar, station house officer of Pataudi police station. A police source said low visibility caused by fog may have caused the collision.

There has been a surge in road accidents in January – just the first two weeks of the year have seen 15 deaths, TOI had reported on Saturday. Besides problems of visibility, the number has flagged concerns about road safety measures and design flaws.

Garbage pile in Husainabad

LUCKNOW: Recent wet spell in the city exposed LMC's claims on the efficacy of its waste disposal mechanism.

In a spot check on Friday and Saturday, TOI found garbage stinking in many localities in old as well as new city areas. Uncollected garbage piles on roadsides was found strewn on streets after incessant rain on Thursday raising unbearable stink.

Unhygienic conditions may jeopardise LMC's prospects in Swachh Bharat Survey-2020 starting Monday. According to guidelines issued by the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MOHUA), LMC may lose 200 marks under service level progress in the survey.

Faizullaganj residents said LMC sanitation workers were dumping garbage on roadside. ""More than 5-6 vehicles come here daily and dump garbage on roadsides. Its stink is unbearable and stray animals make it messier,"" said Manisha Saxena of Faizullaganj area.

""We faced waterlogging during rain as garbage left unattended by workers spilled into drains choking them,"" Jatin Shukla of Vikasnagar said. LMC records show around 1,600 metric tonne waste is generated daily in the city. Out of this, 60% (960 tonnes) is picked through door-to-door collection. The remaining is either disposed of in the open or in garbage bins.

Official in-charge for Swachh Bharat Survey-2020 Arvind Rao said, ""We are regularly collecting garbage from all areas of the city. Improvements have been made and we are expecting good results in the survey.""

MUMBAI: BMC ranked G-South ( Worli ), from where Yuva Sena chief and state minister Aaditya Thackeray got elected to the assembly, as the cleanest ward.

CHENNAI: In a few months, 155 additional toilet complexes are set to come up in the city including at least 84 exclusively for women.

After conducting a survey and receiving feedback from residents, Greater Chennai Corporation , which currently has 1,245 toilet complexes with around 7,888 seats, has renewed its push to construct more toilets.

According to official figures, under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the corporation will soon instal 145 conventional toilet seats in 49 locations, while 44 seats in 22 locations will have e-toilets.

In addition, the corporation has planned to use the money available under the Centre's NIRBHAYA funds to procure 150 toilet seats which can be specifically be used by women (SHE e-toilets). These will be available in 84 locations, an official of the civic body said. A tender will soon be floated for the e-toilets on January 28, official sources said.

Data provided by the corporation shows that there are 872 conventional toilet complexes, 151 e-toilet complexes, 31 bio-toilets, 21 Namma toilets, 19 prime toilets, 19 smart toilets and 132 rental toilets in the city.

Surveys conducted by a few NGOs working in the field have found that many toilets lack proper cleaning, mainly due to shortage of water. However after a relatively good northeast monsoon, which accounts for about 60% of the city's annual rainfall, corporation officials say maintenance this year is likely to be better.

With officials at the zonal officials saying there is always a fund crunch, the corporation is looking to tap into the corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds of companies in the public sector as well as in the private sector to maintain these toilets. In exchange for giving funds, the companies will be able to advertise their products on the walls of the toilets. Banks will also be able to install ATM kiosks at these toilets, corporation officials have indicated.

During a function recently, officials were photographed near a toilet complex in Kodambakkam zone that sported the banner of a top insurance company.

An official said another public toilet, in the commercial hub of T Nagar, was being maintained by a private company by using its CSR funds.

LUCKNOW: An unemployed postgraduate man was duped of Rs 5 lakh on the pretext of a clerical job in Air India by a man who claimed to be an officer in the company.

The man lodged an FIR of cheating at Gomtinagar police station on Friday evening.

Vinay Khand resident Manish Kumar Yadav, who has a commerce degree, said he had been applying for government and private jobs but could not get success.

In 2017, a man named Sunil Kumar Bhardwaj met him, claiming to be a senior officer at Air India. He offered Yadav a clerical job but demanded Rs 7 lakh from him.

Yadav ""convinced"" Bhardwaj to seal the deal for Rs 5 lakh. He gave Bhardwaj Rs 3 lakh in cash and Rs 2 lakh through bank transactions and began waiting for an appointment letter. For two years, Bhardwaj remained in contact with Yadav, telling him he would get a letter soon. However, recently, he had started ignoring his calls and messages. Yadav asked him to return his money but Bhardwaj blocked his number.

""I traced Bhardwaj's house in Delhi and reached there. But his neighbours told me he had shifted out. They said Bhardwaj had duped many others,"" Yadav said. Gomtinagar SHO Amit Kumar Dubey said investigation was on.

Representative image

MUMBAI: After Pune police, Mumbai police on Friday arrested Pune builder Deepak Sakaram Kulkarni (DSK) and wife Hemanti for allegedly cheating some Mumbaikars of 3.5 crore.

Shivaji Park police took custody of DSK (71) and Haimanti (61) from Yerawada jail, after seeking a production warrant from a Mumbai court. They have been remanded to police custody.

The Kulkarnis were already arrested by Pune police for two offences of cheating and under Maharashtra Protection of Investors Depositors’ Act (MPID) in 2018.

Gayatri Lohite from Andheri alleged that in 2016 she saw an advertisement during Navratri, of DKS Madhukosh’s housing project in Saki Naka. Her family visited the DSK office at Veer Savarkar Marg, Shivaji Park, saw brochures of the project and decided to book a 670 sq ft flat for Rs 1.20 crore. The flat was purchased in a joint agreement between Gayatri and her husband, and they initially gave a Rs 1 lakh cheque as token amount, and later paid Rs 25 lakh and Rs 7.23 lakh by cheque to DSK and Co Developers’ Ltd (DSKL).

In December 2016, the sale agreement was registered at Kurla, and the developers were to hand over possession by March 31, 2018. Gayatri approached State Bank of India for a loan of Rs 95 lakh. SBI checked documents, compiled a search report, and cleared the loan. “There were vast differences of the search report submitted by DSK’s advocate and search report by SBI’s legal department,” said a police officer. As per the agreement, the land where the building was being constructed was mortgaged in favour of Bank of Maharashtra, but SBI’s legal department omitted this fact in the title search report and only submitted an NOC from Indiabulls.

On the basis of the demand raised by the developers, SBI released Rs 36.62 lakh and Gayatri was being charged instalments and interest. Even after the deadline she did not get possession of the flat. By that time Pune police had arrested DSK. Following further inquiries, Rajesh Kulkarni and Rajasaheb Kesarvani had also booked flats in that project but did not get possession. The three lodged a complaint with Shivaji Park police and an FIR was registered. It transpired that DSK was in Pune police’s custody in two cheating cases.

MUMBAI: In the strictest sentences awarded in the city for delay in depositing tax deducted at source (TDS), Ballard Pier magistrate court recently convicted and sentenced the director of a film production house to one year's rigorous imprisonment. The maximum sentence earlier awarded for a delay was six months.Nirav Dama of Footcandles Film Pvt Ltd was found guilty of delaying payment of Rs 25 lakh TDS, deducted by the company in 2009-10. The court refuted the submission that the delay was due financial losses faced by the company. “TDS is the government amount, it cannot be used for personal purposes by the accused. Therefore, the reason of financial crisis and loss to company of the accused is not sufficient reasonable cause for such failure,” additional chief metropolitan magistrate Irfan Rehman Shaikh said.The court also said that even if the company was in loss in 2008-10, its business was not stopped. “Remunerations of directors and employees were paid as usual and day-to-day business was carried out regularly,” the court said.Special public prosecutor Amit Munde, who sought severe punishment against the accused, submitted that in addition to the huge amount defaulted, a big sum was also given to the director. Munde said this showed there was no financial crisis. “Because of the conduct of the accused, government suffered heavy losses,” he said.The court also fined the company and Dama Rs10,000 each.The case was filed in court in 2014 by income-tax officers (TDS). It was submitted that the amount was paid after a long delay, beyond 12 months.Among other grounds cited for seeking acquittal, the defence submitted that that there was a huge refund to be paid by the income-tax department to the company. But the court said, “Deposit of TDS amount and claiming refund are totally different aspects. Therefore, depositing of TDS amount cannot be dependant on the refund amount.”The court said that even depositing TDS amount and interest before initiation of court proceedings will not aid the case of the accused.“It is clear that the accused admitted not paying deducted TDS amount within the stipulated time. No doubt, the accused paid the tax with interest and penalty, but it was after the stipulated period,” the court said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73366447,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-116501,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/firm-director-gets-record-1-years-ri-for-tds-delay/articleshow/73366441.cms

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Union minister Smriti Irani at a rally in Varanasi on Saturday

VARANASI: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath slammed the Opposition for organizing protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act and accused it of hatching a conspiracy to create unrest in country by misleading people .

Addressing BJP's pro-CAA rally at Sampurnanand Sanskrit University ground in Varanasi on S

aturday, Yogi said Congress, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party stand exposed by standing with those raising anti-India slogans. He also asked Opposition to reveal its relations with anti-national groups like Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) and Popular Front of India (PFI).

Targeting Congress, Yogi said, ""It is scared of Prime Minister Narendra Modi like Pakistan PM Imran Khan. After 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, country wanted to teach a lesson to Pakistan, but then Congress-led government did not do so saying Pakistan has nuclear weapons. Condition of Congress is no different than Imran Khan.""

""Congress accepted partition on communal grounds to grab power. It forgot what Mahatma Gandhi stated for providing citizenship to minorities who came to India after being tortured in Pakistan.""

""The Citizenship Act was introduced by Congress in the light of Liaquat-Nehru pact but it is now misleading countrymen on it,"" Yogi said and exhorted cadres to foil Opposition conspiracy of causing anarchy by misleading people and challenging the federal structure by not implementing the law in states ruled by it.

He also recalled how Dalit leader Jogindar Nath Mandal, who had supported Jinnah and became first law minister of Pakistan, decided to return to India after three years on witnessing the brutalities against non-Muslims there.

Union minister Smriti Irani said it was well known till now that Congress was anti-Hindi and anti-Sikh, but it has now proved to have become anti-Christian also by opposing CAA. Irani said, ""Congress chief Sonia Gandhi never made any comment when places of worship of Christians were attacked in Pakistan, though she shed tears on Batla House encounter. Nobody knew that Congress will also stand against Christians.""

""The massacre of Kashmiri Pandits in Kashmir had started on January 19, 1990 and it is a coincidence that I am addressing this rally on the eve of an unfortunate date. The cries of the families, women and girls, who were raped and forced to convert and marry, in Pakistan were never heard by Congress.""

Slamming Rahul Gandhi for his remarks against Savarkar, Irani said he can't match his courage even after taking 10 births.

CM Edappadi K Palaniswami

CHENNAI: The National Population Register ( NPR ) exercise with the new fields, including place of birth of parents, was acceptable to Tamil Nadu, said officials.

The non-BJP ruled states raised objections over the new methodology to be adopted at a high-level meeting of chief secretaries and census officials convened by the Union home ministry in New Delhi on Friday. The houselisting phase of Census and NPR will be carried out from April 1 to September 30.

The ministry officials are said to have told the states at the meeting that certain responses from the people would not be mandatory but voluntary.

""The Tamil Nadu government is ok with the additional questions in the NPR as they are not relevant in our state,"" a senior government official told TOI. The federations of Muslim outfits and political organisations took up the issue with chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami recently, insisting that the old format of NPR be continued and that the amended one would affect the interests of the Muslims. The Kerala government has put on hold the NPR exercise in the state.

While chief secretary K Shanmugam did not participate in the meeting, the state was represented by revenue officials. The meeting saw a brief presentation on the strategy for Census 2021, besides the appointment of the census functionaries, NPR, printing and logistics facilities, use of mobile application in data collection, a first in census, and central monitoring portal.

Posing questions on the security features of the mobile app, some states had suggested manual collection of data along with digital mode. ""The stand of the TN government is that NPR is fine, but not the contentious National Register of Citizens (NRC),"" said an official. The opposition has claimed that NPR enumeration was a prelude to implementing NRC.

""There was nothing in the ministry's meeting which was even political. It was just on the operational front. During the question hour, there were hardly three or four questions raised and they were all technical,"" said an official, seeking anonymity. ""There are obligations for the state and central governments on conducting the census. The idea is to count where you live, and what you do. The intent of the Centre is only to find out the migration pattern, moving or immobile,"" the official added.

480,['19/01/2020'],Chandigarh: Users have till Febuary 17 to file power tariff objection,"This story is from January 19, 2020

The department has started a drive against consumers with dues

CHANDIGARH: Consumers have until February 17 to go before Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) in Gurgaon, Haryana, with objections to the UT administration's tariff petition for the next financial year (2020-21).

They can also file their suggestions. In the recent annual revenue requirement (ARR) and tariff petition filed with the JERC, the UT electricity department hasn't proposed any power tariff increase for the next financial year. In the current fiscal as well, no hike was proposed, and the electricity regulatory body had even approved it, later. Commission's last orders made the new tariff applicable with effect from June 1, 2019, and remain valid till further orders.

The last time power tariff increase in the city was in the financial year 2018-19. The JERC had then increased the domestic and commercial consumption charges marginally, while reduced the rates for the industrial segment. The domestic charges were increased from Rs 2.55 to Rs 2.75 for up to 150 units of consumption, while the rate of Rs 4.80 in the slab of 151-400 units was unchanged. In the slab of above-400 units, the rate was increased from Rs 5 to Rs 5.20 for each unit.

Along similar lines, a small increase in tariff for the commercial consumer category as well was made in the year 2018-19. In the 0-150-unit slab, the rate remained Rs 5, while in slab of 151-400 units, it was increased from Rs 5.20 to Rs 5.30 for each unit. In the above-400-unit slab, the increase was from Rs 5.45 to Rs 5.60 a unit.

Inside sources said the department had started a drive against consumers who have massive dues. After notices of default, the power supply lines of these major defaulters are being disconnected.
