It’s about speaking up and confronting.”Shashaa has composed the song and written the lyrics of the Hindi version. “It’s a duet, sung by me and Chinmayi.

The point was to cater to our audiences, who speak both Tamil and Hindi, and to spread the message, considering it’s a crucial one,” she adds.Ask Chinmayi how she came to associate with the song and she says, “Shashaa sent me the work about two-three months ago and asked me what I thought of it. She then asked me if I could sing it for her. She’s pretty serious about writing, arranging and composing, and has done a good job. We recorded the song in the second week of December.”Shashaa chips in, “Chinmayi was a dream to work with. I’ve idolised her for over a decade and to be able to collaborate on a song with her was absolutely surreal.

10,['11/01/2020'],"If Nivin Pauly wasn’t scared to play a gay man, why would I be?: Roshan Mathew","The innocent smile of Amir, the deaf-mute guy in Mothoon who falls in love with Akbar, will haunt anyone who has watched the film. Actor Roshan Mathew has hit the purple patch and came into the limelight by making the gentle Amir a memorable character that Mollywood can always cherish.At his home in Kakkanad, Roshan looks a bit exhausted. He rushes in after winding up some pending work, apologises for being late and keeping us waiting. “I am caught up with preparing for a couple of movies which are expected to begin next month,” he explains, making himself comfortable on the sofa. The actor who debuted in Malayalam through Adi Kapiyare Kootamani and became popular through Anandam, is also known for his theatre production A Very Normal Family (AVNF). “We are working on our second play now. I am doing a performance-based story. Life is busy,” he goes on as we listen in…It was the most satisfying acting and life experience. Firstly, it was a project that brought together many people I craved to work with. On top of that, Amir was easily the best written character I got to play. I have always considered myself lucky to be an actor who got to play characters that are distinct from each other. Amir was very interesting and full of love. All I did was to do justice to what Geetu (Mohandas) had written.The energy I found on the sets of Moothon is something that I now long for at every set. With a lot of positivity around, all you want to do is give your best.Honestly, I had no second thoughts. Anything Geetu offered, I would have taken. So, there was no moment when I had thought negatively about Amir. I never thought of reactions from society. If Nivin, who has a lot more to lose than me, wasn't scared, why should I be?I'm not aware of this sentiment as it hasn't reached me or anyone from the team of Moothon. I do not know if I am qualified to say if the film has done justice as I am not from the community. At the end of the day, I am an outsider who is trying to understand and learn about the community. It is a process; a self-taught process. But in terms of representation, and separating myself from the film, I think it has been closest to a realistic and sensitive effort at portraying characters or telling a story from that community, as far as Malayalam cinema is concerned. Now, how the story ends or how the movie itself ends I think, is the perogative of Geetu, as director-writer.Geetu has the licence to tell the story that she wants to tell, rather than be caught up with trying to be too politically correct at every step. I think every filmmaker has that right, while they still have a responsibility to be sensitive to the issues they deal with and towards the truth. At the end of the day, we need to recognise that you are handling a form of art which influences a lot of people.I started my tryst with acting through theatre. Films happened when I had, not even in my wildest dreams, imagined doing it. I didn't think films were accessible to someone with no family background in cinema or someone who doesn't have a godfather.I started doing theatre at a very early age and decided that it would be something I’d do for life. I even thought I would make my living out of theatre. When I went to Mumbai, while learning theatre, I realised that it is probably going to be impossible to make a living out of theatre and started auditioning for web series, ad films, films and what not. Then out of nowhere, offers started coming my way for Malayalam movies. I did films for two years, and then realised that I really miss theatre. I got in touch with a couple of people in Kochi whom I knew used to do theatre. We started small with friends and unexpectedly, organically, it began to grow into a professional theatre production.We thought Kochi doesn't have a theatre culture, so why don’t we start one, as it has all the ingredients that Mumbai has. We too have artistes who have come in from all parts of the country to the film industry. A lot of people are waiting for good work and a keen audience. The only thing we lack is performance spaces and I guess those too are coming up now at a healthy rate. We will try our best to kickstart the culture. If it doesn't happen now, it will definitely happen 10 or 20 years from now.AVNF, despite not being a great play as compared to some of the great productions that is happening in the country, ran to seven full house shows. We tried really hard to make the best play as possible with the available resources.Of course. If it didn't have the names that it did, would people have come to watch the show? Probably not. But the only positive side we saw, and which makes us keep going, is that all through the seven shows, we saw people walk up to all of us and talk about the play rather than ask for a selfie. So, even if people were coming in to watch moderately popular film actors 10 metres away, we somehow managed to entertain for more than 40 minutes and make them say, ‘Hey, we never knew theatre could be this’.The second production we have doesn't have anyone from films. If it doesn't go well, we will know that we got an audience earlier because we were film actors.I don't really know what it is about a play that restricts it to a certain economic class, apart from the ticket price. We tried to make AVNF shows as democratic as possible. We performed our opening show at Nishagandi in Thiruvananthapuram, though the space wasn't conducive to our performance. In Kochi, the venues called for a higher expense and so tickets were priced in a way that allowed us to at least break even. Ten years ago, while I was in Mumbai or Chennai, even I couldn't go for the shows because it was expensive. I felt terrible to know the same was happening here.The only way to get out of this is by having sponsors, which isn’t easy in Kochi, because investors are looking for returns. This is something everyone in theatre has to go through until we get where Mumbai is right now. There is a certain amount of money running in the theatre circle and venues which are affordable. These are the struggles while starting off in a place with no theatre culture.We know those who came for our show were mostly our social media followers. It is not ideal to give up on that privilege and say, ‘we will be just like our predecessors who functioned in an ideal way out of love for theatre’, and end up losing hope. I think, better be practical. Maybe eventually, we will be able to make it more democratic.Choked is about two people suffocating in a marriage. Anurag Kashyap is a very exciting person to work with. He is big on improvisation. He likes to see what happens in the moment. There are very few boundaries when you work with him. It is always fun to work with a team that you completely trust because you just focus on what you are going to do. You can explore.There are three movies awaiting release. One is Sidharth Siva’s movie with Parvathy, the second one is Kappela with Anna Ben and Sreenath Bhasi, directed by Muhammad Musthafa, and the third is Pennum Cherukkanum helmed by Aashiq Abu based on Unni R’s short story, which is part of an anthology.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73188121,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-857985/73188121.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/if-nivin-pauly-wasnt-scared-to-play-a-gay-man-why-would-i-be-roshan-mathew/articleshow/73188121.cms
11,['11/01/2020'],Mayank Agarwal: My goal is to win World Cups and championships,"Mayank Agarwal has become the new poster-boy of Indian Test cricket, with him being one of the top scorers in the format last year and finishing as India’s highest test run getter for the season. Getting there, though, has not been easy; he’s had a long, hard wait of almost a decade, showing just how consistent his work is. Despite all the on-field feats, Mayank is not as flamboyant off it, compared to a lot of his compatriots, preferring to let his work do the talking. We caught up with the elusive cricketer on a sunny morning, right after a practice session.The year has been about a lot of experience, as far as playing international cricket goes. It has been great. India being on top of the Test championships has also been a great feel good factor. The experiences and spending time in the Indian dressing room were great.(Laughs) I definitely did not. For me, it is about going out there and playing for the country and doing the best I can while contributing to a win. Records will come and go; that will always take a backseat for me. Winning and contributing to the team’s success is my priority.I can’t point out one favourite innings. The year started off well with the Sydney Test and with us winning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. There was no better way to start 2019, as team India. Following this, I got to score double hundreds, so it has all been memorable.There has been a lot of preparation for the tournament. I am going to be playing India A games and then will be a part of the Test series. I have really been looking forward to it. I watched New Zealand play Australia and understand how their bowling works. Hopefully, we can go there and win. The more we win abroad, the more confident we are and the better we feel.To be honest, as a player, you know that Test cricket is the ultimate form of the game. T20 does challenge you in some ways, but Test cricket is way different. Since it is played over five days, it challenges one in different ways. It is alright to not have a good day, as you can still make a comeback — that is the thrill. It is not enough to have just one good day to win the match. You have to play well over the period of 4-5 days to win the game. Having said that, from the time I began, all I cared about was representing India and playing all formats of the game.Domestic cricket is very important, because it sets us up when we go and play for India at the international level. The Indian domestic circuit is not easy at all, because we have a long season and we play a lot of matches. With India being a very big country, we play a lot of games in different parts. This gives us experiences to understand what we can do when we are put in different situations. If a player can go through that, then he is obviously better equipped to play international cricket.It is a team sport, so the goal for me, always, is to win championships, World Cups and other tournaments. This remains my first and foremost goal. From there, I would like to contribute in the best possible manner for the country.Something that I always looked forward to, when I began playing cricket as a kid, was to play for the country. I understand, that as a sportsman, you go through ups and downs. It is important to understand what you want to become and then be persistent towards achieving it. Give it all, till you’ve had enough. Setbacks are also important because you understand yourself and get to know how motivated and passionate you are and how desperately you want to achieve your dreams.If you ask me, we players in a team are more like a family because we spend more time with each other than with our families. For, me it is just that. I treat them like how I’d treat members in my family.I share a great bond with him. We sit and laugh over a lot of things. But he understands me as a person. We keep our professional and personal lives separate. So, it is not necessary that I accompany him when he steps out, and he is not compelled to ask me to. I guess that’s how our equation is.I believe that not everything you do or have has to be for public consumption. You can silently do your own stuff and keep moving forward. At the end of the day, it is your dream and your life. All that you want to do is achieve your dream and move on. So, I take the spiritual route for the matter.(Laughs) Funnily, when I was 18, my father asked me to accompany him for a vipassana course. Like any 18-year-old, I was reluctant and not interested. It was only when he insisted that it would help my game that I agreed to accompany him. Eventually, what I experienced in those 12 days was spectacular. I took to it since then and have stuck to it.How does that fit into your training routine?Meditation helps you get a good understanding about your frame of mind. You also get to understand the kind of person you are. So, that really helps you in your game, because you know the lines that you have to stick to or the boundaries that you do not have to cross. Every meditation session that you go to is different, so I relate that to a match. Things aren’t the same every time you step out to play a match; you have to be patient, persistent and keep focusing on what will help you.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73190270,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-168466/73190270.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/mayank-agarwal-my-goal-is-to-win-world-cups-and-championships/articleshow/73190190.cms

13,['11/01/2020'],"More than a remake, our movie will be a retelling of Vicky Donor","Harish Kalyan and Tanya Hope have come together for the Tamil remake of Vicky Donor , titled Dharala Prabhu . The film is directed by Krishna Marimuthu , and the debutant director says that “more than a remake, our film will be a retelling of Vicky Donor”.“I’m a big fan of the original so when I got the offer to direct this film, I asked for some time to work on the script. It needed to be adapted to today’s times, and there are things in the film that might not have suited our audiences. We have made some major changes,” he says. While the original was a cross-cultural romance between a Punjabi boy and a Bengali girl, this one will be between a Tamil boy and a girl from Karnataka. But apart from the localisation, he has also modified the characters to suit the personality of the actors playing them.Elaborates Karthik, “Ayushmann Khurrana’s character was somewhat loud and boastful in the original, but here, Harish’s will be more grounded. He is a boy from a family hailing from Tanjore, and he is more subdued as a person. And while Ayushmann had a carefree attitude, Harish will be a more responsible guy… someone more sorted in life.”Tanya’s character will be a woman of today — independent, confident, and self-supporting.The one character that he hasn’t made many changes to is that of the doctor, played by Annu Kapoor in the original and Vivekh in this film.“It is the soul of the film. This is the character that explains a subject considered taboo in our society to the audience and ensures that it is something that has to be discussed, so I’ve retained it as such,” says Krishna, but adds that Vivekh has brought in his own qualities to the role.“He is known for the social work he does. While he is amazing at comedy, he also manages to make us take note of the messages he gives through them, without making them heavy-handed.

15,['11/01/2020'],Ratheesh Vega: All good musicians have a sense of story too,"For composer Ratheesh Vega , 2019 ended with a flourish. Jayasurya ’s Thrissur Pooram , for which he wrote the script, hit the theatres at the end of December and his tracks for the movie and Anoop Menon ’s King Fish have been vying with each other for the pole position in music charts. The music director talks about his milestones so far and what to look forward to.It was an idea I had for several years. We had planned to start it a few years ago but it got delayed, and we could begin production only last year. For me, movies are a craze and I spent a lot of time developing the script. I would imagine how each scene would play out on the screen along with the music, and I would space out the dialogues accordingly. As a musician, I could figure out easily how music would influence the scenes.Not really. The priority was always the emotions that were conveyed by the characters. The music only accentuated that. For instance, when there are a few seconds of silence between the dialogues, as a scriptwriter and composer I know what the pause should convey. I believe all good musicians have a sense of story because only then they can convey the emotions through their music.The entire film is told through Jayaettan’s character and what he goes through. Throughout his life, he has had losses and he has been lonely. And then when he finds love, I have tried to make the character enjoy that phase in his life. Every person in our society, irrespective of their virtues or vices, is chasing happiness and that is true in Giri’s case too. In the film, I have built him as a man with virtues but due to certain unforeseen circumstances, he gets entangled in troubles.I don’t believe in sticking to a particular kind of music. The film I have scripted has a lot of action scenes and thrilling moments. So, I don’t want to limit myself. But it’s true that I have got more opportunities to compose melodies and that’s why they have been noticed. Last year too, that was the case. Going forward, it could change.We released En Ramazhayil, a track from King Fish, a few months ago and Anoopettan, who was in Dubai then, shared a video of him playing the song in his car. After that, many Malayalis all over the world started playing the song while they were travelling and shared videos of it on social media. It was a huge appreciation for us. The song is written by Anoopettan, who is also making his directorial debut with the film. So, it’s special. It was a coincidence that this song was overtaken in the charts by Thrissur Pooram’s Sakhiyee, which was again composed by me and the whole song’s situation was created by me. I like to think that was a milestone in my career.I am set to publish a book and if a good subject comes to mind, I will definitely work on a script too. The focus this year though would be composing. I have a project each in Tamil and Telugu that I will start work on soon. In addition, I have a couple of films in Malayalam.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73187851,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-44279/73187851.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/music/ratheesh-vega-all-good-musicians-have-a-sense-of-story-too/articleshow/73187851.cms

The album begins with the electric Chill Bro, rendered in Dhanush ’s characteristic timbre. Playing up the film’s catchphrase, Chill Bro, the fast-paced song chronicles the light-heartedness of the film’s hero.Jigidi Killaadi, by Anirudh Ravichander , is a romantic solo. While the lyrics typically compare the woman in attention to arbitrary things like “lemon mint cooler” and “padam ootum theatre”, Vivek-Mervin’s catchy tune is hummable.Pudhi Suriyan plays out like a sweet lullaby in Anuradha Sriram’s rendition. The mild keys compliment her voice, further amplifying the mother’s love for her newborn, as suggested by the lyrics.Morattu Thamizhan Da is exactly what its title suggests. The almost four-minute number is loud, explosive, and never once loses its note, keeping us hooked to its beats. Vivek’s earthy lyrics evokes imageries of Tamil icons Bharatiyar and Kattabomman.Piriyadha Enna is a sweet-sounding ballad rendered by Vijay Yesudas and Niranjana.

18,['11/01/2020'],'When Chai Met Toast' to release their first album this year,"It’s the silver jubilee edition of IIT Madras ’s annual cultural fest Saarang , which will feature the band ‘ When Chai Met Toast ’. The four-piece band — Achyuth Jaigopal, Palee Francis, Ashwin Gopakumar and Sailesh Pai — can’t wait to be on the stage already.Begins Ashwin Gopakumar, “When we were in college, Saarang was one of those headliner events that brought international acts and students would look forward to being there, and that’s something they still do. Watching the bands whom we grew up listening to was a big deal. And from that point onwards, it was the stage that we always wanted to play. Coming here as a band is going to be nostalgic. Well, at least for Achyuth and I as we both have played earlier as part of other bands.”Not many know that Achyuth and Ashwin are also half Tamilians and have done their schooling at Swarnabhoomi Academy of Music.The year has begun on a busy note for the band as they are working towards releasing their first album, this year. “For the first time in four years, we are writing our full-length album, which will have eight to nine songs in it. We began the recording two days ago in a studio based in Mumbai and Kochi. The song-writing process is going on. We are also planning to shoot the videos for the album, which is likely to begin in March. It’s been a year since we started working on the album. I can’t reveal the title (of the album) now, but I can tell you that it’s going to be in the form of an anthology that talks about love and happiness,” informs Ashwin.The musician also informs that there will new musical instruments and new voices, too, in the album. Ashwin adds, “We are experimenting a lot. There is a song without an acoustic guitar... a song with just ukulele... collaborations with other artistes, too. You can also expect a song either in Tamil or Hindi. Like always, we will have songs in English with a few phrases in Tamil and Hindi in the songs. We plan to release the album in the first half of 2020.”Coming from a generation that grew up listening to albums, Ashwin says it’s quite a benchmark for all of them to be able to do this. “As a band, we have released singles and EPs. It’s easier to promote a single, but promoting each song from an album will be challenging and we are looking forward to experiencing that too.”Talking about how online streaming platforms have broadened the horizon to grow for independent music, Ashwin says it’s the best time for all the musicians to put up their work that reaches ears across the globe.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73189458,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1178349/73189458.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/when-chai-met-toast-to-release-their-first-album-this-year/articleshow/73189316.cms

The trailer of the film which released recently is not just exciting for Mahesh fans but movie buffs too. Anil Ravipudi , who’s known for his own style of entertainment, is directing Mahesh Babu for the first time. Before the movie review is out, here are our five reasons why Sarileru Neekevvaru is worth watching:Mahesh Babu plays the role of an army officer called Ajay Krishna and who wouldn’t want to see that? His fans are already pumped after catching a glimpse of their favourite star as a soldier. As the most important sequence of the film was shot at Kashmir, good high-octane sequences are expected in Sarileru Neekevvaru. Apart from that, Mahesh has also explored the comic side of him in this film. After Khaleja and Dookudu, this film is expected to tickle funny bones.It’s been 14 long years since Vijayashanti , also known as Lady Superstar or Lady Amitabh has been seen on-screen. She is returning to form with Sarileru Neekevvaru and this Tollywood Ramulamma is playing the role of professor Bharathi in the film. Known for playing powerful characters throughout her career, the actress seems to have hit gold again. This is not her first time with Mahesh Babu though, for they worked together in Koduku Diddina Kapuram with his father Krishna too.Last Sankranti, Anil Ravipudi entertained audience with F2: Fun & Frustration, a film that was a mass entertainer. And this season, he’s bringing forth Sarileru Neekevvaru with the promise of it holding all the ingredients his films usually hold, making them a perfect watch for the whole family. Earlier, he spoke of how the train episodes in the film will be hilarious and also the highlight of the film. Anil has also reinstated that a lot of surprises await for Mahesh fans from the film, including a cameo by Krishna.After Dear Comrade, Rashmika Mandanna is back with a role that seems to be a polar opposite of it. Mahesh and Rashmika look appealing together and fine chemistry is expected between the duo. The Kannada beauty also seems to be one to watch out for in the numbers He Is So Cute and Mind Block. Her bubbliness and glamour are expected to be a worthy add on to the film.Sarileru Neekevvaru, if a hit, will be a hattrick for Mahesh and DSP together. After giving chartbusters for Bharat Ane Nenu and Maharshi, DSP gave an album fans seem happy with for Sarileru Neekevvaru.

22,['11/01/2020'],It may hit us too but need a new party to pip BJP: Assam ex-CM Tarun Gogoi of Congress,"This story is from January 11, 2020

(File photo)

GUWAHATI: Former Assam chief minister and Congress veteran Tarun Gogoi on Friday said that an alternative political party had become a necessity to oust BJP from Assam.

“A political party has become a necessity now to punish BJP. We are not selfishly looking after our own interests because a new political party might inflict some damage on our party as well. We are trying to protect the interests of the people of Assam,” the three-time former CM said.

The call for a new political party to push BJP out has been gaining momentum among anti-citizenship law protesters ever since the All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu) made such a proposition recently. In 2016, people had voted out Gogoi and Congress after three consecutive terms.

Meanwhile, the Centre has scaled down Tarun Gogoi’s security cover from ‘Z plus’ to ‘Z’ category. In 2016 Gogoi’s ‘Z Plus’ security with NSG protection was brought down to ‘Z plus’ with CRPF cover. Gogoi was given NSG cover in 2006.

“I am not surprised. I know they (BJP) have changed the security level because I have been criticizing them. There can be no other reason,” Gogoi said.

24,['11/01/2020'],Make your wedding a low-waste affair,"In a country obsessed with grand celebrations, headline-making big budget, high-profile weddings are a regular sight. However, it's not always such a rosy affair. Last year, what made headlines was the 240 quintals of waste generated at a Rs 200 crore wedding in Auli. The wedding, hosted by South Africa-based businessmen brothers, turned the hill station into a dumping ground with 24,000 kg of garbage generated after four days of celebrations. But it's not just big budget weddings that generate so much trash. As per reports, it is estimated that more than 10 million weddings take place in India every year and all of these celebrations leave behind truckloads of trash in the form of discarded plastic cutlery, used flowers and a large amount of food, which mostly goes to waste.""On an average, an Indian wedding hosting 400-1000 people results in around 3 tonnes of waste and in some cases even more,"" informs Veena Balakrishnan, who planned her own wedding as a 'zero-waste' celebration after reading some startling facts on the waste that Indian weddings generate. While the idea of a zero-waste wedding with no extravagance is still far-fetched, there are many couples who make the effort to have eco-friendly celebrations. Here are some tried and tested ways to cut down on wastage while still having a blast at your wedding.Do away with plastic chairs and use wooden diwans with cushions for seating. If possible, opt for a day wedding in an open area to avoid additional lightingto elaborate wedding invites that always end up in the trash. But wedding organisers say that ""it is very tough to convince families (especially the elders) to do away with the paper, cardboard invites."" So""The only disadvantage is that seed paper is slightly more expensive than regular paper invite, but that cost can be recovered by saving on other expenditure, like decor,"" says wedding consultant Prakriti. Bengaluru-based Indraja Khare, co-founder of a company that organises sustainable events and weddings, says, ""The number of invites (even if it is seed paper) should be limited and shouldn't be sent to every guest. The easiest way to cut the cost is to go with a one-page invite.""Discarded flowers form the biggest chunk of trash generated from weddings, and wedding planners say that their usage should be cut down. "", this also help small-scale entrepreneurs. Planning a sustainable wedding means making the best use of what's already available,"" says Prakriti Rajvanshi, a Delhi-based wedding consultant, who advises people on sustainable weddings. Mumbai-based Aishwarya Lonial, who calls herself a 'green event and wedding planner' says that the best way to utilise floral waste is to give them to NGOs that make products out of them. ""We collect floral waste and send them to NGOs who make incense sticks, rangoli and Holi colours out of them. The NGOs sell these products and generate funds,"" adds Aishwarya.Sharing an example from her sister's wedding which happened in Bikaner last year, Prakriti says, ""We used nimbu-mirchi as decor for my sister's sangeet, and later, distributed them among relatives who used them for cooking purposes. We also used table mats made of jute sacks.We had handmade sign boards using seed paper and cardboard scrap. Special seating tags were made using upcycled scraps of jute bags."" Aishwarya adds that""Choose your venue wisely and we advise against constructing elaborate structures just to have a theme wedding. It results in wastage of wood, thermocol and other material that cannot be reused,"" she says.Sustainable gifting doesn't mean just gifting plants, it also means come up with sustainable ways of gift wrapping.While you can't always control what guests gift you, you can be sustainable with return gifts.Prakriti shares that for her sister's wedding, she created envelopes made of newspapers that had a wax seal with the initials of the bride and groom. All clothes, including kota doria saris for bridesmaids, were locally sourced and for packaging, she says, ""We made bags out of my mom's old organza sari, which could later be used as laundry bags.""Repurspose old saris to make gift bags, give locally-sourced garments, seed potlis and planters as giftsThanks to the comeback of Banarasi and traditional embroidery, many brides are going through their mothers and grandmothers' trunks for saris and lehengas that can be upcycled for their wedding trousseau.""Even designer lehengas are available on rent now, which is the most economical option. Many young brides are now doing away with buying expensive lehengas and are open to the idea of renting,"" says Indraja.Cut down on the number of functions, choose a venue that requires minimum construction and use locally-sourced flowersThis bride upcycled old Kolhapuris for her sangeet ceremonyPlastic and thermocol plates and cutlery and food are among the biggest generators of waste at weddings. However, now that many NGOs have started collecting surplus food from weddings and distributing it among the needy, it is easier to minimise food wastage. But cutlery still remains the primary source of plastic waste at weddings. ""Ceramic and steel cutlery are getting popular at weddings, but people still tend to go for plastic bottles or glasses. Disposable bamboo glasses should be preferred over paper or plastic glasses,"" says Aishwarya. You can also opt for banana leaves and reusable steel glasses.Get some old world charm by opting for steel plates and glasses instead of plastic ones",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73187866,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-294264/73187866.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/make-your-wedding-a-low-waste-affair/articleshow/73187619.cms

Also, when I was here, I was mostly in Cantonment area, and wasn’t much exposed to the civil life. But today, I made the most of my off from the shoot and explored different places in the city.

It addressed the globally-shared experiences of trauma and gender violence through Fado music (a Portuguese form of mourning music) and live experimental electronics. There were multiple thought-provoking frames, for instance, there was a scene where a group of women are sitting inside a train compartment and chopping vegetables while returning from office.

28,['11/01/2020'],Is winter making you gloomy? It can be more than just mood swing,"Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a mood disorder that makes one feel sad, lethargic and low, especially in winters. Here's a guide to recognising the symptoms and seeking help when neededThe cold winter months appear dreary and dull to many. While for some, it is the weather to sip on some hot chai and snack on yummy halwas, but for few, the weather brings with it a feeling of lethargy and gloom. But it's more than just a mood swing for them. Experts say that if the pattern is consistent and one feels low at a particular season for consecutive years, chances are that they are suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) – a type of depression that is relatable to changes in the season. Most commonly occurring during winters, in some people, the disorder also causes depression in spring or early summer. Dr Paramjeet Singh, a Consultant Psychiatrist based in Delhi, says, ""Symptoms can include anxiety, low mood, change in food habits, insomnia or an excessive need for sleep, etc.""SAD is caused due to a change in weather and the sense of gloom continues for a considerable time. Consultant Psychiatrist Dr Paramjeet Singh says, ""SAD is diagnosed specifically when a person develops a depressive episode around the same time every year, which is not related to his/her occupation. It is triggered by a change in season and sunlight balance, and is often associated with low sunlight periods.""Explains Alka Kumar, a school counsellor, ""SAD normally comes like a packaged deal with weather changes. Most of the time, SAD is associated with a time period – say incessant, continuous rains – when a person is forced to remain shut inside their house for too long, due to the weather.""The symptoms are similar to any other mood disorder – low mood, anxiety, lethargy, insomnia or the need for excessive sleep are some of the symptoms of SAD. However, Vibhavari Kattoju, a Delhi-based Consultant Psychologist, says, ""One needs at least two years of a consistent pattern in the symptoms to be able to call it SAD. Symptoms include feeling low, lazy, lethargic – the signs of depression. SAD is a sort of depression, but the difference is that it occurs same time every year.""One of the most popular ways to treat SAD is through light therapy. Says Paramjeet, ""The patient sits in front of a lightbox, which provides light in a certain wavelength to the person, mimicking natural daylight."" Alka adds, ""You cannot change the weather, but you can change your mood, and that's where light therapy helps.""Other forms of treatment include psychotherapy, counselling or the use of medication. ""Low dose anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medication, and depending on the severity of the condition, psychotherapy or talking cure (counselling) may be resorted to, to treat the patient,"" says Paramjeet. Vibhavari adds, ""Medication may be used, but it can only be prescribed by a psychiatrist, not a psychologist.""While you should seek professional help if you have SAD, there are a few things you can incorporate in your lifestyle to help you cope better:Try and spend as much time as you can outside in natural light to help your body cope with the lack of light in wintersIt will help you relax. Chamomile tea relaxes, while matcha tea helps increase energy levels.Write down your mood every day, and keep a track of how you are feeling, and when. This can also help you track when your low phases begin, and what all you do to cope with it.1. SAD usually happens in winters, especially in areas away from the equator, where the days are shorter. However, there have been some documented cases of SAD in summers, says Vibhavari Kattoju, a Consultant Psychologist based in Delhi.2. SAD, being a mood disorder, could develop into something more serious in the future, like bipolar disorder, says Paramjeet Singh, a Consultant Psychiatrist based in Delhi.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73186301,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-164603/73186301.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/is-winter-making-you-gloomy-it-can-be-more-than-just-mood-swing/articleshow/73186208.cms

They not only chase their own dreams, but also help each other achieve their goals.

Since the film is set in that time period (83), you will see characters being excited about the match and talking about it.” In the film, Chandan plays a teacher who aspires to become a journalist. “I play a government school teacher.

Times View The media briefing by the police on Friday has raised further questions about the impartiality of the probe. For starters, the police named students even as they maintained that the investigation is at a preliminary stage. If the police have evidence that those they named are indeed guilty, why not arrest or book them? And if they don’t, doesn’t it constitute defamation? Then there’s the fact that the briefing repeatedly harped on the Left affiliation of some of the students named while staying silent about the others (independently identified as ABVP activists). Revelations by a TV channel raise further questions. We hope that by the time the probe is completed, the police will have put to rest all doubts about its credibility.

NEW DELHI: The police tried to lift the fog around the investigations into the violence at JNU last Sunday but left people with more questions than answers on Friday.At its first press conference since the incident that rocked the campus, the special investigation team (SIT) formed to probe the case disclosed the names of nine people who they claimed had indulged in violence on the campus - seven are from Left groups and two from Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). The names of the Left groups were mentioned repeatedly but the affiliation of the remaining two wasn't mentioned. JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh , who received injuries in the violence, was among those named as a suspect.Interestingly, while the police claimed the investigations were at a preliminary stage and they were not detaining anyone yet, grabs of videos showing the suspects were circulated. Sources clarified that they had so far probed only the incidents during daytime and the previous days - when the server had been allegedly damaged - and the investigations into the Sunday evening mayhem were still on.SIT chief DCP (crime) Joy Tirkey said efforts were being made to identify more people. ""Our investigation is based on evidence. This is the first of many press briefings on the case. It is being done to ensure fact-based reporting. The investigation has just started,"" he said. The crime branch has deployed more than 80 personnel to speak to teachers, students, JNU administrators and residents of the campus to get a clear picture of the sequence of events.Since the case is sensitive and involves a prestigious university, we are taking proper care to ensure that the future of the students involved is not affected,"" said Delhi Police PRO Mandeep Singh Randhawa. ""We usually brief the media once the investigation is complete. However, we called for a briefing because all sorts of reports were circulating about the progress of the investigations,"" he said.In the absence of video footage and the faces of the attackers being covered, the police is trying other methods to identify the perpetrators of which a majority are suspected to be from right-wing groups.The SIT claimed to have found the involvement of an ex-student, Chunchun Kumar, who is an AISA activist and has been purportedly caught on camera wearing a mask, pelting stones with one hand and holding a stick in another outside Periyar Hostel. Pankaj Mishra from School of Social Sciences, who lives in the Mahi Mandavi hostel, is on the list. Aishe Ghosh, also named, is seen in a video at Periyar hostel in a group. The fourth person is Sucheta Talukdar from School of Social Sciences, an AISA member. Priya Ranjan from School of Language and Literature, Bhaskar Vijay Mech, an MA student at School of Arts and Aesthetics, and Dolan Samanta from Centre of Historical Studies, who is seen covering her face with a scarf, are the others. Yogendra Bhardwaj, administrator of 'Unity Against Left' WhatsApp group, who is doing Sanskrit in PhD, and Vikas Patel, who is pursuing MA in Korean, belonging to ABVP, were also named as suspects.The police have found names of 36 students who were part of the 'Unity Against Left' group, on which messages to mobilise people after the attack were being posted. This group had 60 other members who are being identified. Some of them claimed that the group was formed by an apolitical group of students who wanted to register for the winter session after the Left groups had started blocking them from doing so.The police had initially released a wrong photo for one of the suspects, Vikas Patel, which was later rectified.Sources said it was dark when the masked goons entered some of the hostels and very few videos have been able to capture them. The police is going to send notices to all of them and question them about being present at the scene of violence before they are arrested.The police suspect there were a lot of internal elements who were involved in clashes at Periyar and Sabarmati hostels since the attackers had targeted specific rooms and vandalised them. Meanwhile, in order to identify 'outsiders', cops have seized the entry registers from all the eight gates of the campus and are scanning them.""During the initial probe, we found some names of people who had entered with the reference of some students. We have asked for their details from the JNU administration and will question them as well,"" said a police officer. The SIT is probing all three cases of violence at JNU that have been registered since January 3.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73196909,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1159437,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-police-point-finger-at-mostly-left-groups-at-jnu/articleshow/73196908.cms

NEW DELHI: JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh challenged the police to prove she has been involved in last Sunday's violence at JNU and make the evidence public.Ghosh, who was named along with eight others as suspects, was part of a meeting between a JNU delegation and HRD secretary Amit Khare when the news broke. Speaking to the media after the meeting, she said: ""What proof do they have? They should make it public. I have full faith in the law and am ready to face any enquiry. I also have evidence, videos of how I was attacked. We are not going to concede an inch from our struggle as we have done nothing wrong.""Alleging that cops didn't act in time to stop the violence, Ghosh said: ""I sent a message asking the police to stop the carnage. There was a murderous attack on me and the police is naming me for the violence?""I am getting emotional because of the situation and what we have been facing for all these days. We have not done anything wrong and we are fighting for our rights as students. The police have been acting on the behest of their political masters and telling lies in an attempt to deflect the attention from ABVP,"" JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh said.Dolan Samanta, also named as one of the possible perpetrators of the January 5 violence, said: ""The photos they have shared are of a march where thousands of students were there and only my face has been pointed out. There is another video they are sharing from the school area which happened during the day, around 10-11am, when a few ABVP students who were inside the school were making videos of women who had formed a human chain against ABVP violence that happened on January 4.""Samanta added: ""We don't have any sticks and stones in that video and neither are we trying to hide ourselves. I want to ask Delhi Police, when we have screenshots and sting operations in which ABVP people are agreeing that they perpetrated violence, how come you are only intimidating those who are fighting for this movement? You actually want to crush our spirit.""Sucheta Talukdar, a second year masters' student, said: ""We are activists and students. It is a residential campus and right now also if I am sitting with a friend, anyone can click my picture and use it. Time and again ABVP has attacked us on the campus and then we are made the accused. Aishe was bleeding and fighting for her life and they registered an FIR against her. The same thing happened with Pehlu Khan and Tabrez."" Responding to the names of two ABVP activists named by Delhi Police, ABVP JNU unit president Durgesh Kumar accepted that the two are ABVP activists. However, Kumar alleged that the picture of Patel may be doctored.Kumar also said that Bhardwaj has been named because he created a WhatsApp group.

36,['11/01/2020'],"Regulators 'morons', DGCA 'even stupider': Boeing staff","MUMBAI: Employees of US aircraft manufacturer Boeing, in their internal communications pertaining to the design and certification of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, had ridiculed airline officials and various countries' regulators, including the Indian aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), two years ago. According to reports published on Friday, after calling regulators of other countries ""morons"", a Boeing employee went on to say that India's DGCA ""is apparently even stupider"".The revelations came after Boeing sent the documents - over 100 pages of internal communication by Boeing pilots and engineers on email and instant messaging - to the US House committee on transportation that has been probing the design and certification of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. The aircraft was involved in two fatal accidents in 2018 and 2019 that claimed 326 lives.Responding to a TOI query about the statements made against the DGCA, Boeing said, ""These communications do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable. We regret the content of these communications, and apologise to the DGCA, SpiceJet (which flies Boeing aircraft), and to the flying public for them."" Boeing added that it had ""made significant changes as a company to enhance our safety processes, organizations, and culture"".The company said the language used in these communications, and some of the sentiments they express, are inconsistent with Boeing values, and the company is taking appropriate action in response. ""This will ultimately include disciplinary or other personnel action, once the necessary reviews are completed,"" the statement added.DGCA chief Arun Kumar said he was aware of the comments made by Boeing employees. ""They had made it in 2018,"" he said.Boeing had equipped its 737 MAX aircraft with a software that overrides pilots to push the aircraft nose down when it senses, correctly or erroneously, that the nose is pitched dangerously high. But the company had wilfully stayed silent about this software and the fatal role it could play till the first accident occurred.The internal communications released this week revealed how Boeing employees convinced airline officials and regulators that there was no need for simulator training pertaining to the software. In several messages, Boeing employees insulted FAA officials who were certifying the plane. In one of the exchanges, an employee says the Boeing presentation to FAA on the Boeing 737 MAX was so complicated that for the agency officials ""it was like dogs watching TV"". In another message, sent in February 2018, an employee wrote, ""Would you put your family on a MAX simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn't.""Both crash investigations, Lion Air in October 2018 and later Ethiopian Airlines in March 2019, zeroed in on the controversial software and its malfunctions that caused the aircraft nose to pitch down, leading to the crashes. A month after the Lion Air crash, Boeing issued a safety bulletin to airline pilots that gave information on how to handle the software malfunction.Reporting on this bulletin, TOI, in an article on November 14, 2018, wrote about the need for additional simulator training, the only way to ensure pilots who fly the Boeing 737 MAX could competently handle the software's characteristics. Two days ago, Boeing finally said it would recommend additional simulator training for Boeing 737 MAX pilots.The Boeing 737 MAX was grounded worldwide 10 months ago. The Boeing 737s currently in operation worldwide, including in India where SpiceJet flies it, is the older version, the ""Boeing 737 NG"" model, which is not equipped with the malfunctioning software.Speaking about the mocking messages sent internally by Boeing employees, Capt Amit Singh, a senior aviation professional, said, ""In the case of Boeing 737 MAX, the Indian regulator and those of other countries accepted the design and certification granted by US FAA, the home regulator. That was the norm."" The regulators and airline officials believed and trusted what Boeing said. ""On certain activities, FAA has granted Boeing the authority to act on its behalf, to carry out self-certification. Boeing-FAA relationship was built on respect, trust,"" he added.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73197006,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-735416,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/regulators-morons-dgca-even-stupider-boeing-staff/articleshow/73196981.cms

Times View The media briefing by the police on Friday has raised further questions about the impartiality of the probe. For starters, the police named students even as they maintained that the investigation is at a preliminary stage. If the police have evidence that those they named are indeed guilty, why not arrest or book them? And if they don’t, doesn’t it constitute defamation? Then there’s the fact that the briefing repeatedly harped on the Left affiliation of some of the students named while staying silent about the others (independently identified as ABVP activists). Revelations by a TV channel raise further questions. We hope that by the time the probe is completed, the police will have put to rest all doubts about its credibility.

NEW DELHI: A first-year student of JNU, who claimed to be affiliated to ABVP, admitted to ""mobilising men from outside"" and leading the attack by masked vigilantes and 20 ABVP members on teachers and students, and vandalising hostels on the evening of January 5, an undercover investigation by India Today has revealed.The student, Akshat Awasthi, said streetlights being switched off just before and during the attack was the work of ""police, administration... whose police is it?"" The lights were switched off, he said, as that was when ""we were mobilising"".In the sting operation, Awasthi said that on Sunday he called the ""organisational secretary of ABVP"", whom he named, but it was beeped out in the telecast. Following their chat, he mobilised Sunday evening's hooliganism, he claimed.All three students interviewed in the investigation were from JNU. Awasthi is pursuing a French degree. The second, Rohit Shah, also asserting allegiance to ABVP, is in the French language course too.Awasthi also identified himself in the footage of the January 5 attack - jeans, jacket and a helmet covering his face and head. He said he could be seen rushing down the hostel corridor, smashing anything that came his way. He boasted that he mobilised the attack in retaliation to an assault allegedly by Left students on Periyar hostel earlier the same day.India Today reported Awasthi also identified both people in the most viral footage of the attack - of a girl with her face covered and the male with a sledgehammer - as fellow ABVP associates. Awasthi said that after the raid, he found a fellow ABVP member hiding. He assured her he was from ABVP, ""took off the helmet, put my arm around her, and walked out as a couple"".The stick in his hand was pulled out from a flag near Periyar hostel. Asked if he hit anyone, Awasthi said, ""There was a man with a flowing beard. He looked Kashmiri. I beat him and kicked down the gate.""Security guard GV Thapa told India Today that 10-15 men, in shawls with lathis, forced through Saraswatipuram Gate where he was on duty a little after 7pm on Sunday. ""They threatened to beat me and went in,"" he added.Shah told the undercover reporters that he lent Awasthi the helmet. ""It is a must when you smash glass."" The mob came to his room too, but moved on after he told them (masked men) ""it was an ABVP room."" Asked if he was proud of their actions, he said, ""Of course, of course.""The third student was former JNUSU president of AISA, Geeta Kumari, who admitted to ""closing the server room"" to cripple the administration's functioning. ""There are no exams. None of our demands are met. He (VC Jagadesh Kumar) didn't even meet us. Our VC does everything online, sends 'love letter' online, sends Happy Near Year online, sends warnings/ threats online...""Reacting to the probe, ABVP general secretary Nidhi Tripathi said, ""Anyone participating in ABVP or JNUSU events cannot qualify to become members automatically. Akshat Awasthi is neither an office bearer, nor karyakarta of ABVP. Anyone involved in the violence at JNU should be prosecuted. We will fully support police in their investigation.""",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73197134,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-42329,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sting-unmasks-jnu-hostel-attackers-all-abvps/articleshow/73197132.cms

NEW DELHI: Frowning at the mechanical imposition of prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) since the British era to the present day, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday they cannot be used to quell dissent or expression of grievance in a democracy.In its judgment on restrictions imposed on movement of people in J&K after the August 5 decision to remove its special status and divide it into two Union territories, the bench said, ""Power under Section 144 CrPC cannot be used as a tool to prevent legitimate expression of opinion or grievance or exercise of any democratic rights.""The bench emphasised application of the provision should be limited to situations of emergency and for preventing obstruction and annoyance or injury to any person lawfully employed. It also said ""repetitive (prohibitive) orders under Section 144 would be an abuse of power"" and directed authorities to notify all prohibitory orders passed in J&K so as to enable aggrieved persons to challenge it at an appropriate forum.But as in the case of the part of the verdict dealing with the suspension of internet in J&K, Justices N V Ramana, Subhash Reddy and B R Gavai recognised the need for the state to use Section 144. The thrust appeared to be more on the prevention of misuse of the provision; to ensure that it was used judiciously rather than turned into a blunt weapon.Thus, the court said the provision, which was both remedial and preventive, could be used not only to deal with an existing danger but also in situations when there was apprehension of one, so long as the ""danger"" qualified to be an emergency and likely to result in ""obstruction and annoyance or injury to any person lawfully employed"".The bench said the use of the provision was subject to judicial review and, hence, should be resorted to reasonably and on the basis of material facts. ""While exercising the power under Section 144 CrPC, the magistrate is duty bound to balance rights and restrictions based on the principles of proportionality and apply the least intrusive measure,"" it said.The effort to negotiate the duel between the utility of Section 144 for dealing with emergency-like situations and the experience of its misuse came across clearly in the court's observation, ""As emergency does not shield the actions of the government completely, disagreement does not justify destabilisation; the beacon of rule of law shines always.""However, it also cautioned against too much stress on the ""proportionality doctrine"" to temper restrictions in cases relating to the security, sovereignty and integrity of India.It noted that imposition of the section over a larger area and longer duration required a higher threshold.Referring to senior advocate Kapil Sibal's argument that governments in future could misuse powers under Section 144 to impose blanket restrictions to prevent opposition parties from elections, the bench said, ""Our Constitution protects the expression of divergent views, legitimate expressions and disapproval, and this cannot be the basis for invocation of Section 144 CrPC unless there is sufficient material to show likely incitement to violence or threat to public safety.""",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73197184,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-342528,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sec-144-cant-be-used-to-quell-dissent-repetitive-orders-an-abuse-of-power-sc/articleshow/73197183.cms

SRINAGAR: There were strong indications on Friday, a day after foreign envoys arrived in Jammu and Kashmir to assess the situation, that the government was working out a deal where MP and National Conference chairman Farooq Abdullah and his son, MLA and former J&K CM Omar Abdullah , would be released from detention in exchange for their promise that they would take a break from active politics for a while.Well-placed government sources said the offer was being readied and the Abdullahs may be approached.A top government source said one idea was to find a way to nudge the Abdullahs to move for a while to the UK.The sources said the two could, however, run their party's affairs through ""agents in the UT of J&K"".The Abdullahs have been in detention since J&K was stripped of its special status on August 5 last year and later bifurcated into two Union Territories.This came even as the J&K government on Friday revoked the detention warrants of 26 people, including senior lawyer Nazir Ahmad Ronga of Nishat.Ronga, a former Kashmir bar Association president, is a close associate of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, a separatist who is chairman of his faction of the Hurriyat Conference.The revocation of the provisions of the J&K Public Safety Act of 1978 against the 26 came hours after the Supreme Court directed the J&K administration to review the curbs imposed in the UT while saying the freedom of speech and conducting business on the internet are protected under the Constitution .",politics,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73197196,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-525873,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//politics/politics-specials/govt-deal-in-works-for-release-of-abdullahs/articleshow/73199189.cms

Internet access in Kashmir was restricted following abrogation of Article 370

NEW DELHI: Thirty-five years after declaring that newspaper publication was part of the right to free speech, the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that expression of views and carrying out trade through internet are also part of the constitutionally guaranteed fundamental right to free speech and indefinite suspension of internet services is impermissible.

“We declare that freedom of speech and expression and the freedom to practice any profession or carry on any trade, business or occupation over the medium of internet enjoys constitutional protection under Article 19(1)(a) and Article 19(1)(g). The restrictions upon such fundamental rights should be in consonance with the mandate under Article 19(2) and (6) of the Constitution, inclusive of the test of proportionality,” a bench of Justices N V Ramana, R Subhash Reddy and B R Gavai said.

The verdict came on petitions filed by Congress’s Ghulam Nabi Azad and Kashmir Times publisher Anuradha Bhasin against the suspension of internet in the wake of the Centre’s decision to scrap the special status for J&K. The SC said it did not test “whether right to access to internet is a fundamental right” and was hence not expressing any opinion on it as none of the counsel advanced any arguments on this issue.

The order marked an attempt to deal with the perennial tension between the right to freedom and liberty and the requirements of national security and public safety, with the court seeking to locate the pendulum in the middle. It placed the “legitimate” use of internet in the pantheon of fundamental rights, while acknowledging that it was subject to reasonable restrictions, like other fundamental rights.

On balance, the court took the line that while access to internet should be the norm, deviations could be allowed in the interest of order and safety provided they were temporary, proportionate and justified by reasons which were spelt out clearly and reviewed periodically. “We direct the state and competent authorities to review all (existing) orders suspending internet services forthwith,” the bench said.

The SC also said since existing provisions did not provide for periodic review of orders or the duration they would remain in force, “we direct the review committee must conduct a periodic review within seven working days of previous review” of orders suspending telecom services.

The continued internet shutdown in Kashmir has been a contentious issue, with opposition and activists criticising the curbs and the government insisting it was a security issue to be evaluated by the local administration, wary of the use of social media and messaging services to organise and foment trouble. The internet shutdown also attracted adverse international commentary.

The verdict steered clear of getting into the question of whether the communication ban was illegal, made no adverse comments on the Centre but made it clear that a prolonged shutdown could not be countenanced unless it was periodically reviewed and a satisfactory justification offered. It could also set the stage for the executive to close the gap in rules which do not limit the period for which internet services can be suspended.

Writing the judgment, Justice Ramana said, “An order suspending internet services indefinitely is impermissible under the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Service) Rules, 2017. Suspension can be utilised for temporary duration only.”

On the criticality of internet in contemporary times, it said, “There is no doubt that there are certain trades which are completely dependent on internet. Such a right of trade through internet also fosters consumerism and availability of choice. Therefore, freedom of trade and commerce through the medium of the internet is constitutionally protected under Article 19(1)(g), subject to the restrictions provided under Article 19(6).”

In December 1984, the SC in the Indian Express case had declared that freedom of print media was covered under right to free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution.

The ruling making free speech and trade through internet part of Article 19 would mean views expressed on social media using internet must not fall afoul of restrictive boundaries in the shape of security of the state, friendly relations with foreign countries, public order, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence. This could open a new chapter in social media experience.

It said no fundamental right was absolute and right to free speech too could be restricted by the government in compliance of requirements under Article 19(2) of the Constitution. To impose restrictions on free speech, including use of internet, the SC laid down the ‘doctrine of proportionality’ and said the degree and scope of restrictions, both territorial and temporary, must have a clear nexus with the necessity to combat an emergent situation.

AGARTALA: Dismissing an inquiry against a retired employee of the state fisheries department, the chief justice of Tripura high court on Friday said that government employees can take part in political programmes, including meetings, and freely post their opinions on social media platforms, without attracting punitive measures under Rule 5 of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules.

Justice A Kureshi said that attending a political rally would not be considered as involvement in politics and government employees should have the personal liberty to post their opinions on social media.

Lipika Paul was dismissed from service on April 25, 2018, four days before her retirement, for taking part in a political programme in December 2017 and making a social media post against BJP.

""During election times, as is well known, political parties and their leaders as well as nominated candidates take out rallies and address public gatherings. Every person who is present in the audience during such addresses cannot be stated to have participated in the rally. The presence of a person does not either establish his or her political affiliation. A student of politics, an enthusiastic young man, a reporter or just a curious bystander - all are likely to be present in any political gathering. Even an opponent or a critic of a political party may also attend the gathering. Her mere presence at a gathering, therefore, without any further allegation, would not amount to her participation in such political gathering,"" the court order stated.

""I have taken note of the contents of the said post which originally was in Bengali and has been translated and presented before me. Nothing contained in the said post suggests canvassing for or against any political party. It only expresses certain beliefs of the petitioner in general terms. As a government servant the petitioner is not devoid of her right of free speech, a fundamental right which can be curtailed only by a valid law. She was entitled to hold her own beliefs and express them in the manner she desired of course subject to not crossing the borders laid down in sub-rule (4) of Rule 5 of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules.""

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday took less than 10 seconds to stay the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's December 18 decision reinstating Cyrus Pallonji Mistry as executive chairman of Tata Sons , a post from which he was removed in 2016 by the board of directors.The skills of a heavy-duty line-up of senior advocates - Harish Salve, AM Singhvi and Mukul Rohatgi - enlisted by Tata Sons to challenge the NCLAT judgment were underutilised as a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant ordered notice on its petition while staying operation of the order within seconds of the plea being called for hearing.This triggered strong protest from several other senior advocates - C A Sundaram, Shyam Divan, Maninder Singh and Neeraj K Kaul - engaged by the Shapoorji Pallonji group, Mistry and Sterling Investments. They told the SC that Mistry himself had said he did not want reinstatement as executive chairman but wanted to protect the interest of minority shareholders.""The Supreme Court must keep operational the NCLAT decision rescinding conversion of Tata Sons to a private company from a public company,"" Sundaram argued.He also said representation of Shapoorji Pallonji group through a director, which has been traditionally done, must be maintained.Tata Sons refused and contended that the NCLAT order was completely wrong and set a wrong legal precedent which endangered corporate democracy.This was vindicated by observations from the bench which refused to accede to Shapoorji Pallonji group's fervent requests not to stay the NCLAT judgment. The group was seeking a status quo order.CJI Bobde said, ""There appears to be a basic flaw in the NCLAT order reinstating Mistry as executive chairman of Tata Sons as that relief was never sought. Something appears very wrong. We looked at the judicial approach of NCLAT in the case and found it sorely lacking.""Sundaram said a status quo order was necessary as stay would enable Tata Sons to take coercive steps under law to buy out shares of the Shapoorji Pallonji group, which has invested around Rs 1 lakh crore in Tata Sons. But Salve pre-empted the apprehensions by undertaking before the court that Tata Sons would not resort to coercive steps to buy back shares of minority shareholders.The SC asked the Shapoorji Pallonji group to respond to petitions filed by Tata Sons, Ratan Tata and other Tata group companies and their directors, in four weeks.Mistry was removed on October 24, 2016, nearly four years after his appointment. Of the eight directors, seven voted for his ouster while one abstained. Tata Sons, in its petition filed through solicitors Karanjawala & Co, said the NCLAT order directing reinstatement of Mistry was gratuitous as none of the appellants, Cyrus Investment or Sterling Investment, had ever sought such a relief.Criticising the NCLAT decision, Tata Sons said, ""The impugned judgment has torn apart the rights of majority shareholders and directors enshrined under the articles of the Companies Act, 2013, and disenfranchised all other shareholders of Tata Sons, including Tata trusts.""The petition is likely to be mentioned for urgent hearing on Monday.

PATNA: After the successful trial of speed guns on the Jagdeo Path-Sheikhpura Mor flyover, the Patna traffic police are now planning to use them on other flyovers, roads and highways across the city from January-end.

In December last year, altogether 20 speed guns had been acquired to keep a check on overspeeding and reckless driving. Of these, only two were used by traffic cops and several motorists penalized on the Jagdeo Path-Sheikhpura Mor flyover.

According to transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, 20 more speed guns with inbuilt printers will soon be acquired to keep tabs on errant drivers and frequent violators.

“Acquiring additional speed guns is a temporary arrangement. We are now planning to fix these guns on poles at strategic locations in the city and other parts of the state so that the entire system becomes automatic,” Agarwal told this newspaper on Friday.

He added, “The poles will detect the speed and number plates of the vehicles and also click their photographs.”

A senior traffic cop said, “Overspeeding is not just dangerous for motorists, but for others around them, too. If they clash with another vehicle, they are likely to get hurt or die. We have, therefore, taken several measures to reduce accidents and keep a check on rash drivers. We have identified the vulnerable roads, highways and flyovers in the city.”

Nagpur: With an aim to promote non-motorized transport, fitness, cleanliness and recreation, people have been turning up in large numbers for Happy Streets , organized by The Times of India and Maharashtra Times in association with the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), on the last three Sundays.

Officials, corporators and activists have appealed to revellers to use public transport and avoid parking in non-permitted areas or in a haphazard manner blocking entry to buildings.

DCP (traffic) Chinmay Pandit said such vehicles will be towed away by traffic police. “Despite being a Sunday and early morning, traffic police will be on duty. They will also initiate action against two-wheeler riders blowing horns above permissible decibel level,” he said.

Municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar said people residing close to West High Court where Happy Streets is held should use bicycles or come walking. “I am delighted to see a large number of people, especially youths, enjoying Happy Streets in early morning hours despite low temperatures. Happy Streets is a platform where people should learn discipline and create awareness among others,” he said.

“Haphazard parking is a big issue throughout the city. People coming to Happy Streets from far-off places should use public transport. The NMC is operating a big fleet of buses every morning. City buses plying on Amravati and Hingna Roads can be well utilized for Happy Streets. The NMC is executing several programmes to promote Swachh Bharat Mission, which too should be learnt from Happy Streets,” he said.

Corporator Sanjay Bangale said it is the responsibility of people coming to Happy Streets to keep citizens living in nearby areas happy. “Our aim is to make this city free from pollution and improve health. People should use bicycles or shared vehicles for Happy Streets or any mass public event. Participants should avoid creating problems for others by not parking in front of gates across the city. All these are part of public participation in developing and making the city free from congestion and pollution,” he said.

The NMC has given permission to park four-wheelers in two open spaces at Dharampeth and Tilak Nagar. Also, one lane of parking is permissible on Amravati Road, WHC Road (from Laxmi Bhuvan Square to Shankar Nagar Square), all roads coming to WHC Road at Times square, Coffee House Square and Laxmi Bhuvan Square. Another advantage for participants is that parking in permitted locations is free of cost.

Mayor Sandip Joshi, Bangar, West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre, Bangale and other guests who visited Happy Streets on last three Sundays appreciated the turnout and appealed to make the city happy with their full support.

48,['11/01/2020'],Police in search of a Darbhanga youth for links with Lakdawala,"This story is from January 11, 2020

PATNA: Bihar police officials are trying to ascertain the identity of a youth from Darbhanga district, who was in touch with Ejaz Yusuf Lakdawala , a former aide of fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. Lakdawala was arrested from Jakkanpur police station area of the state capital by a joint team of Mumbai police’s crime branch and the state STF on Wednesday and subsequently taken to Mumbai by a flight the same day.

Highly placed sources said the Darbhanga resident had also contacted Lakdawala on his cellphone on Wednesday soon after he reached the state capital from Nepal. The youth, stated to be a native of a village under Jale block in Darbhanga, had reportedly promised Lakdawala to help him in obtaining a fake identity proof for him to be later used for getting a passport issued from the regional passport office in Patna.

Sources said the telephone number of the youth in question was provided to Lakdawala by a Maulvi during his stay in Nepal. “The youth in question was in dire need of a job and can be used for any purpose,” a police officer said, quoting Lakdawala, who was detained at the Jakkanpur police station before being flown to Mumbai.

The intelligence agencies have also come to know about another youth, who was present at the Mithapur bus stand under Jakkanpur police station area to receive Lakdawala, who was coming from Nepal. Sources said the identity of the two youths in question was being ascertained by the police. All the top police officers of the state were tight-lipped over Bihar connections of the arrested don.

Darbhanga in north Bihar had earlier been associated with a terror outfit Indian Mujahideen. Danish, stated to be a close associate of IM co-founder Yasin Bhatkal, was arrested from Laheriasarai in Darbhanga district in 2013 for his alleged involvement in subversive activities. Bhatkal, who was arrested from Raxaul on Indo-Nepal border in East Champaran district in August 2013, had spent long time in Darbhanga to set up a sleeper cell of the banned terror outfit.

Chennai: Industry body All India Gems and Jewellery Domestic Council has written to the PMO, home ministry and the finance ministry seeking a reduction in import duty from 12.5% to 6%, ( It was increased from 10% to 12.5% in the last budget) and an increase the availability of credit from banks.

“A reduction in import duty will help ease demand. We are hopeful of a favourable move and expect to see gold demand similar to the levels of 2018, in the upcoming year,” said Anantha Padmanabhan, chairman, GJC. He noted that gold imports were down by 10%-15% y-o-y in 2019 and added that business saw a drop of 30% by volume in last six months. “As a result, quite some jewellery workshops shut operations. We are working with World Gold Council and Metal Focus to gauge the situation. Over the next 6 months, we hope to come up with an estimation of how many shutdowns were seen,” he added. Emphasising the need for tax reduction, Padmanabhan claimed the industry saw increase in gold smuggling resulting from increased customs duty, along with goods and services tax hike. Buyers were also opting to purchase gold from countries like Dubai, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Singapore. The GJC’s chairman also appealed to the government to constitute a steering committee before issuing a notification making hallmarking of gold mandatory across the country from January 15, 2021. Through the steering committee, the government may seek industry opinion before implementing the notification on hallmarking

With hope that the government would implement the recommendations, the council expects that the industry would post a 10% increase in business by volume in 2020 despite a 30% drop in last 6 months of 2019.

51,['11/01/2020'],PC seeks dismissal of 63 Moons suit,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Swati.Deshpande@timesgroup.com

Mumbai: Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram has questioned the maintainability and has sought dismissal of a suit by 63 Moons — a financial technology company founded by Jignesh Shah . The firm had sued him and two IAS officers for damages of Rs 10,000 crore.

The suit is in connection with the Rs 5,600-crore National Spot Exchange ( NSEL ) payment default case of 2013. It alleges misuse and abuse of erstwhile Forward Markets Commission by the trio and claims they are “personally liable” for their “wrongful and mala fide acts apart from the government itself”.

Chidambaram has sought dismissal of the suit. He says that the government ought to have been mandatorily made a party to the suit as the minister and bureaucrats were acting in their official capacities. The government is not a party. The two IAS officers are Ramesh Abhishek and K P Krishnan . Chidambaram also said he is filing a separate application for rejection of the suit for being “barred by law and for failure to disclose cause of action”.

The Bombay HC had on December 13 given an additional four weeks as a final extension to Chidambaram and the two IAS officers to file their statements in response to the suit. Justice A K Menon had noted in the order then, “If written statement is not filed within four weeks period, the suit shall stand transferred to the list of undefended suits.”

Chidambaram filed his reply on January 9. It says that the allegations in the suit are “baseless, entirely devoid of any substance and expressly denied”. Chidambaram has sought a stay on the suit, while the legal point of maintainability and making government a party is decided first.

He says that under the civil procedure code, “it is a mandate that where a suit is filed against a public officer for damages in respect of any act alleged to have been done by him in his official capacity, the government shall be joined as a party to the suit”.

The company has made multiple allegations against the department of consumer affairs (DCA), including that it had eventually forced the NSEL, promoted by 63 Moons (formerly known as FTIL), to suspend its trading. The suit alleged that an “abrupt directive by DCA in July 2013 created a panic and chaos”. DCA thus ought to be made a necessary party, says Chidambaram.

Through a statutory notice, the company had last February intimated the trio of its intention to file the suit. The HC had last year in June allowed the company’s plea to sue Chidambaram in Mumbai. “This is a suit for damages for the malicious and mala fide actions on the part of defendants claimed to have caused damage to the plaintiff (63 Moons) and resulted in erosion of the value of the plaintiff’s shareholding due to fall in price of its share on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange, both situated in Mumbai,” the HC order had said then.

The HC is expected to hear the matter next week.

52,['11/01/2020'],‘Non-customer facing regional level officers will be rationalised’,"Chennai: Canara Bank chairman T N Manoharan in a free-wheeling chat with Mamtha Asokan addresses various issues — from the bank’s branch rationalisation plan, employees’ worry over lay-offs, hurdles in the lending business, employee skill gap to need for a secondary market for corporate loans. The public sector bank has less than three months to complete the merge process with Syndicate Bank. In August, 2019 the Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a mega merger plan for 10 PSBs which are to be consolidated into four. Post the merger, Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank will stand as the nation’s fourth-largest lender. Excerpts:What impact will rationalisation of officers have on Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank?Non-customer facing regional level officers will be rationalised, while the rest will remain unaffected. Service for the respective branches (both Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank) will continue, as there is no intention to rationalise them. Branches will continue as usual. There will be rationalisation only for the regional level offices where there is no customer interface. A joint task force is formed to monitor all steps of the merger and it will decide the basis of rationalisation as we reach our merger deadline of March 31, 2020.What kind of skill gap do you see among banks employees? Is there any immediate demand for skilling and reskilling of employees?Credit function needs immediate focus, even though marketing and sales are equally important. In terms of lending, while earlier the focus was corporate lending, now it is retail. Thus, skilled employees in credit function play a vital role. Demand for skilled employees in Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering hold the second place, especially when digital operations on rise, so are frauds.On the whole, there is not much skill gap among the existing staff. As far as BFSI upskilling is concerned, we have BFSI Governing Council which overlooks this process, besides central recruitment process. Canara Bank has tied-up with private skilling institutions like Manipal BFSI.What are your concerns on bank’s lending business going forward?The primary concern is lending to corporate clients. Unlike other countries, we do not have a secondary market for corporate loans. The RBI Monetary Policy Committee has accepted recommendations in December to set up a ‘self-regulatory body’, that will help form a secondary market platform to address corporate loans and simultaneously set the rules and regulations.Will there be any lay-offs post the merger?Despite a rise in digital banking, the need for bank branches and physical presence of bankers is growing. Of the total transactions, we have achieved 74% online transaction (e-transactions), compared to 60% in 2018, and 40% in 2017. About five years ago, our employee strength stood at 42,000, while in 2020 it stands at 60,000, despite 18,000 employees having retired.Do you expect more consolidation among banks? What is the roadmap going forward?To compete globally we need strong and big banks. Even, the State Bank of India had to absorb smaller banks to attain that strength (branch and book). Why do we need so many small banks competing with each other? That’s why we need consolidation of banks to avoid unhealthy competition. There is a possibility for more mergers in the future.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/non-customer-facing-regional-level-officers-will-be-rationalised/articleshow/73196290.cms
53,['11/01/2020'],High CO2 levels may seal fate of Western Railway’s auto-shut door plan,"This story is from January 11, 2020

The Western Railway is likely to abort its plan for automatic door-closing system in local trains following co... Read More

MUMBAI: The Western Railway is likely to abort its plan for automatic door-closing system in local trains following concerns over suffocation due to increased carbon dioxide levels in coaches and adverse impact on punctuality. Recently, WR conducted trials of the automatic door-closing system with the aim to prevent commuters falling off crowded trains. In 2019, 550 commuters died after falling off crowded trains.

During the trials held between January 2 and 5, a 12-car train with three coaches—a ladies compartment, a second class compartment and a luggage compartment—refitted with automatic doors were operated during both peak and non-peak hours. It was observed that the carbon dioxide level was between 710 and 960 parts per million (PPM) in the three coaches during non-peak hours.

As per specifications of the Integral Coach Factory, the concentration of CO2 inside a railway coach should be less than 700 ppm for ambient temperature.

“These levels are during non-peak hours. We have to still measure the levels during peak hours; it could be high as commuter density will be more,” said a railway official. CO2 levels between 1000 and 2,000 ppm can cause drowsiness, and levels beyond this can result in increased heart rate and nausea, said doctors.

“The trials are complete, we are now preparing a final report. The report will be sent to the railway board, which will then take a decision on whether or not to run non-AC trains with closed doors,” said Ravindra Bhakar, WR, chief PRO.

On the adverse impact on punctuality, during trials it was observed that the train with the three door-closure system took more time to cover the same distance when compared with regular rakes.

For instance, it was found that the running time of a 12-car between Churchgate and Borivli is 65 minutes with 20 station halts. But, the running time increased by 8-10 minutes due to time lost in opening and closing of doors. Sources said the travel time on the fast corridor between Churchgate and Virar is expected to increase by 6-7 minutes.

According to railways data, a 12-car train should carry 3,504 commuters, but during the peak hours, it carries an average 5,000 commuters.

Also, the average halt time at a station increased to 57- 61 seconds from 30-40 seconds due to opening and closing of coach doors. Also, if the train’s automatic doors malfunction during the peak hours, it will have a cascading effect on punctuality, said a source.

Commuters too were not enthused with the closed coaches. Mumbai Central resident Nirmal Jain said, “The door-closure system can only work in AC coaches. If we feel suffocated in winter months, imagine what would happen during summer?”

But Virar resident Raju Naik feels commuters need time to adjust to the door-closure system. “In regular trains, people get on and off a train even before it comes to a halt at the station, which is dangerous. If the doors remain shut, this situation can be avoided.”

PATNA: The number of crimes against women in 2018 went up by more than 15% as compared to the previous year, according to data published by the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB). The state saw more than 2,200 cases in 2018 (16,920) as compared to 14,711 such cases in 2017. The number of cases reported in 2016 was 13,400.

The report highlights that in 98.2% rape cases in the state, the culprits were known to the victim.

However, the crime rate against women in Bihar, which is measured as number of incidents of such crime per one lakh population, is much lower compared to the national average across all states, which stands at 57.5. While the rate of such crimes in Bihar is 29.8, Assam has the highest in the country at 166, followed by Delhi with the crime rate of 149.6 per one lakh population.

The categories of crimes included in the NCRB report are rape, kidnapping, assault on women with intent to outraging her modesty, cruelty by husband and relatives and dowry death among others.

Bihar state women’s commission chairperson Dilmani Mishra attributed the rise in the number of crimes against women in the state to more women coming out to report. “Earlier women used to remain quiet, but now education and awareness regarding their rights have made them aware and they report to the police. Also women’s commission, police and the media have given them constant support to fight against atrocities and it is good that they are coming out of their homes,” Mishra said.

The NCRB report also pointed out that that in most rape cases in Bihar, culprits were known to the victim. A total of 651 cases of rape were reported in 2018 in Bihar and in 639 cases, rapists were known to the victim. Most of the known rapists were either friends, online friends or live-in partners or separated husbands accounting for 563 rape cases. Only in 12 cases, rapists were not known to the victim, while seven were family members and 219 were either family friends, neighbours, employers or other known persons. Of the total rape cases reported in 2018, there were eight cases of gang rape.

The data also revealed that 540 rape survivors were in the age group of 18 and 30 years, while 111 rape victims were in the age group of above 30 and below 45 years. There were 16 cases of rape of women between the ages of 45 and 60 years. No rape cases were registered among children below 12 years and there was just one case in the age group of 12 and 18 years.

Apart from rape, the state recorded 106 cases of assault on women and 113 cases of sexual harassment (Section 354 A of IPC). Though no cases of sexual harassment were reported from the work place, 22 such cases were reported from public transport and 91 from other places.

Other assault on women included cruelty by husband or relatives with 2,539 incidents reported, forced miscarriage 20, acid attack 6, disrobing 23, voyeurism 3 and stalking 17 in 2018.

56,['11/01/2020'],‘Patna Science College to apply for re-assessment’,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Patna Science College

PATNA: The 92-year-old Patna Science College , which was awarded ‘B’ grade (2.16 CGPA out of 4) by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) on Thursday, has decided to apply for re-assessment after expiry of the mandatory one-year time.

The college’s newly-appointed principal, S R Padmadeo, told this newspaper on Saturday that he was unsatisfied with the “poor NAAC grade”.

“I have started going through the self-study report submitted by the college and will make sure that all the loopholes are fixed. We will create a healthy environment of teaching and research in the institution before applying for re-assessment. With presentation of facts in a systematic manner, the college is bound to get an ‘A’ grade,” he said.

Earlier, in its first cycle of accreditation in 2007, Patna Science College had been awarded a ‘B++’ grade.

Meanwhile, former students of the institute, which was once called the ‘Cambridge of the east’, are equally disappointed.

“It is unfortunate to learn that Patna Science College , which was once at the helm of academics in the country, has deteriorated so much. We are all responsible for its downfall,” rued college alumnus and Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University (Jammu and Kashmir) vice-chancellor (VC) Ravindra Kumar Sinha.

Popularly known as the ‘Dolphin Man of India’, Sinha said, “With many academics being interested in other pastimes, the standard of teaching and research has gone down considerably. It will be difficult to restore the old glory of science college unless a sound academic environment is created here.”

Patna University former VC and science college’s former principal, Arun Kumar Sinha, observed that NAAC grades did not reflect the real status of any institution. “The peer team was all praise for the college, but it was awarded a ‘B’. The fact is institutions, which do their paperwork properly, are awarded better grades,” he said, but admitted that the college faced lack of teachers and infrastructure.

Another alumnus, Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha, who is the working president of the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar , criticised the entire process of accreditation of universities.

He said, “The new education policy draft envisages only two types of institutions, universities and autonomous colleges. Now, there will be only a few autonomous colleges in the country, opening the doors for more and more private colleges. The poor children of Bihar are bound to suffer with the mushrooming of the so-called autonomous and private institutions.”

PATNA: Police on Friday arrested four youths on charges of raping a 26-year-old married woman at a village under the Mansoorchak police station area in Begusarai district , twice on the same day. The woman approached the police on Thursday, six days after the assaults, once her husband returned home from an outstation job.

The incident took place around 6pm on January 3 when the woman, mother of three, was returning home after buying vegetables from a local market. In her police complaint, the woman alleged that she was waylaid by the four youths – Dheeraj Kumar, Ajay Kumar, Sonu Kumar and Rajan Kumar – who took her to a nearby field and raped her.

The woman’s ordeal did not end there. The four youths forcibly took her to a deserted place behind the Mansoorchak block office, consumed liquor and again took turns to rape her. She was let off late in the evening only after being robbed of her cellphone and Rs 2,000 in cash.

While Dheeraj is a resident of Dashrathpur Kishun Tola, the other three accused hail from Mansoorchak village under the same police station area in Begusarai district.

Teghra SDPO Ashish Anand said the woman was sent to the sadar hospital at Begusarai for medical examination on Friday. “All the four accused have already been arrested. Further investigation is underway,” the SDPO told this newspaper over phone.

The woman lodged the FIR with the Mansoorchak police after her husband, who works as daily wager outside the state, returned home on Thursday.

PATNA: Biting cold continued to sweep the state even on Friday under the influence of cloudy condition and cold northerly winds. Meteorologists said though clear skies are expected by Saturday afternoon, dense fog cover would be witnessed in the early morning hours in Patna and most parts of south Bihar .

According to weathermen, the night temperature is expected to fall by two to three notches over the next two to three days. Day temperature, on the other hand, is expected to increase by a couple of notches at most places in the state.

Patna Meteorological Centre has predicted that minimum and maximum temperature in the state capital would hover in the range of 11-13 and 18-20 degrees C, respectively, till January 15.

Though India Meteorological Department (IMD), in its all-India weather bulletin issued on Friday evening, stated that cold day condition would prevail in Bihar on Saturday, officials at Patna Meteorological Centre ruled out such weather conditions.

According to daily weather bulletin issued by Patna Meteorological Centre on Friday, minimum temperature in the city was recorded at 12.6 degrees C, four notches higher than normal. Lowest minimum temperature was recorded at Dehri in Rohtas district, where the morning minimum fell to 6 degrees C.

The comparatively higher minimum temperature was attributed to the cloud cover prevailing at many places in the state from last couple of days under the influence of a western disturbance . The cloud cover prevented the radiation from the Earth’s surface to escape in the upper level of atmosphere in the early morning hours, thus keeping the minimum temperature tad high.

However, it was the maximum temperature of 17.4 degrees C in Patna, four notches lower than normal, which led to cold conditions during the day time. Lower day temperature was also attributed to the cloud cover.

Weathermen said it was the cold north-westerly winds which created shivery conditions in the state. “There has been substantial snowfall in the Himalayan region, including Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, over the past few days. Cold north- westerly winds coming from the snow-laden Himalayan peaks was blowing in Bihar at an average speed of 12-14kmph on Friday, leading to shivery conditions. Such weather conditions would prevail in the state over the next two to three days,” an official at Patna Meteorological Centre said.

PUNE: The airport authorities are conducting a trial of an artificial intelligence powered baggage screening solution, ‘Baggage AI’, which is supposed to ease the work of the airport authorities as well the CISF ( Central Industrial Security Force ) when it comes to baggage scanning during security check-in.

“Baggage AI is an artificial intelligence (AI) based solution developed to enhance security at airports. It is the first-of-its-kind threat detection system for security x-ray machines. This AI software technology can automatically detect various objects and other threats from the x-ray images produced during the screening of baggage and alert operators,” Pune airport director Ajay Kumar told TOI.

Himanshu Arora, the co-founder of the startup (Dimensionless Technologies) that developed the system, said, “There are many small things like a lighter, vaping machine and more which do not appear prominently in an x-ray scan. Baggage AI can detect these objects in the luggage and show them prominently with the help of shades and colour. The trial run has been ongoing for almost a month now.”

Kumar said, “The Airports Authority of India (AAI) had organized an ‘Innovate for airport’ programme under the Startup India initiative. Innovative solutions for airports from over 350 startups across India were screened and eight were selected to implement their solutions at various airports of the country. Of these solutions, Baggage AI is presently under trail at Pune airport.”

PATNA: Unidentified persons allegedly kidnapped the 19-year-old son of Chausa primary agriculture credit society (PACS) chairman Manoj Kumar Singh from Sai Temple area under Patliputra police station in the state capital on Thursday evening.

Manoj reached here from Chausa on Friday and lodged an FIR with Patliputra police station in this connection.

The victim was identified as Manish Ranjan. He had reached Patna from his native Chausa in Buxar district for writing JEE Main exam at a centre located in Patliputra industrial area, according to the FIR lodged by Manoj.

Manish, after coming out of the exam centre, had informed his father that he would stay at a rented accommodation of his friend Raghvendra Singh at Indrapuri and would return home on Friday.

Manish was moving on foot with Raghvendra after eating at a roadside eatery near the temple when a car approached them and kidnapped Manish after thrashing his friend.

It was Raghvendra who called Manoj’s nephew at Chausa informing him about the kidnapping around 7.30pm. Manish had made a call to his father around 5.30pm.

Manoj also mentioned in the FIR that at around midnight, he received a call from an unknown number and his son on the other side said he was in a train and reaching Ara. However, he failed to reach that number again when he rang back.

Patna SSP Upendra Sharma said investigation was on to trace the victim assuming that the boy was kidnapped.

PATNA: Governor-cum-chancellor of universities Fagu Chauhan on Friday called upon the scientists and academics to work for sustainable development and proper management of water resources in the country.

Inaugurating the three-day 52nd annual conference of Indian Water Works Association at National Institute of Technology-Patna here, Chauhan said the entire world was concerned at the ever-declining water table and climatic changes and, if immediate solutions were not found, it would be perilous for the entire humanity.

He said all necessary measures aimed at conserving water resources and optimizing their utilization must be adopted at appropriate levels. The governor appreciated the recent water conservation schemes launched both by the central as well as state governments and said the ‘Jal Jeevan Hariyali’ scheme launched by the state government would not only help improve the declining groundwater level, but also create a better climate.

“All conventional sources of water like ponds, tanks, wells and ahar-pynes should be revived for augmenting water resources and meeting the water requirements of the people. Rainwater harvesting must be practiced at all levels,” the governor said.

State public health engineering minister Vinod Narain Jha said over-exploitation of groundwater resources for meeting agricultural and industrial needs has created acute problem of both quality and quantity in recent times. He, however, expressed the hope that the ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariylai’ scheme would take care of this pressing need of the people and help improve water supply at panchayat level.

Chief minister’s adviser and former chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh said of late tourist places like Rajgir, Nalanda and Bodh Gaya have started facing drinking water problem, creating hardships for the tourists. But he hoped that the ambitious scheme of taking the Ganga river water to Gaya would help rejuvenate Falgu river and solve the perennial water crisis of the region, he added.

Sulabh International founder Bindeshwar Pathak and Indian Water Works Association’s newly elected president Dineshwar Prasad Singh also addressed the conference.

AHMEDABAD: A 30-year-old man from the Satellite area was beaten and robbed by four men on Thursday night when he went for walk at Vastrapur lake .

In his FIR registered at Vastrapur police station on Friday, Kartik Mehta, 30, a resident of Parul Pushpak Flats near Shivranjani Crossroads, said he is a sales executive with a private company in Anandnagar.

“On Thursday at around 8pm, I went to the Vastrapur lake for a walk. After my walk, at around 10.30pm, I sat on a bench and began playing a game on my mobile phone,” Mehta stated in his FIR.

“An unknown man of around 30, wearing a khaki jacket, came up to me and asked on what I was doing there. I responded by saying why he was asking this? As I was talking to the man, three other men, also of about 30, jumped over a wall and began attacking me,” he adds.

The four men began punching and kicking Mehta on his face, chest and stomach. He suffered injuries to the left side of his face, just below the eye. One of the men hit Mehta on left side of his forehead with a stick.

A Metro rake powered by electricity completes a trial run on the 1.4km elevated stretch between Sant Tukaramna... Read More

PUNE: The first full-fledged trial run of a Metro rake powered by electricity was conducted on Friday without any hiccup to and fro on the elevated corridor between Sant Tukaramnagar and Phugewadi stations.

The rake drew power from the overhead electric cables recently installed on the viaduct. The rakes were so far being pulled by battery operated shunting engines on the stretch, which is part of the elevated section of Line 1 of the Pune Metro rail project — between Pimpri and Swargate.

Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) officials said Friday’s trial run was part of the initial testing. “Such trials will continue for the next two months and the running of the rakes will be checked on various other parameters,” an official said.

Two rakes have been introduced on the Metro viaduct along the PCMC-Dapodi stretch. Of the two, MahaMetro officials operated one rake on Friday for 2.4km. The second rake will be checked within the next few days. MahaMetro has completed laying of tracks on a 5km stretch and overhead cables for the supply of power on a 1.4km stretch. The supply was energized on Thursdayfor the rakes’ preliminary tests.

The MahaMetro officials said it was a milestone of sorts to run rakes on electricity within 30 months after the civil work for the project commenced.

MahaMetro has approached the Research Design and Standardisation Organisation, the Commissioner Metro Rail Safety and the Railway Board for obtaining various permissions for the trains’ operations. “The authorities are likely to visit the site and inspect the preparations before granting the permissions,” an official said.

A massive fall is being experienced in kite and manja sales ahead of Uttarayan in the city markets

Surat: Recession has stolen some zing out of Uttarayan when people in Gujarat fill the skies with colourful kites and air with joyful noise. City’s kite and manja markets remain devoid of customers because of cash crunch, with business not even 60 per cent of the past five years, market sources said. But they are still hopeful of sales picking up on Saturday and Sunday before festival of Uttarayan on January 14.

Surat is famous for its kites and manja and businessmen in other parts of the country have been pre-ordering them. However, volume of outstation orders has come down this time.

Rekha Saddiwala, owner of Bhagwan Manja Centre in Bhagal, said, “We have less orders this year. A trader of Anand or Nadiad who previously used to buy 500 spindles of 1,000 yard manja has bought just 300 this year from us. Effects of recession can be felt this year. Till now, no substantial local sale has happened. We had good retail sales last year.” The rate of manja has gone up by just slightly. Last year the rate for 1,000 yard manja was Rs180 and now it is Rs200, she said.

Ravi Natali, another manja maker from Nanpura, said, “Recession is a factor for poor sales but more than that the younger generation is now keen to save birds during Uttarayan. They prefer to stay away from kite flying. People are taking oath in Jain and Swaminarayan temples not to fly kites to save birds. We have 30 per cent less business this year when compared to in the past.”

Kite seller Kamesh Champaneria said, “People who used to buy kites worth Rs1,000 from me just purchased for Rs500 this time. We pray that our available stock of kites is sold out. Rates of kite have gone up by around 12 per cent only.”

He made her download the app and transfer one rupee from her account. Within 20 minutes of her transferring one rupee, he withdrew Rs 1.75 lakh from her account in three transactions.

“The fraudster asked Mistry to down an app and transfer one rupee from her account for verification. As she transferred the amount on Thursday evening, within 20 minutes, three transactions of withdrawal of Rs 75,000, Rs 50,000 and another Rs 50,000 took place. A few hours later when she went online to check if all was right, she found that her money had been stolen in an online fraud,” said an official from Rander police station.

“The call came from some out state number such as Jharkhand. Despite knowing about the online frauds of this kind, people still commit the mistake of believing tele callers. We are trying to get details of the number,” added the official.

Swati.Deshpande@timesgroup.com

Mumbai: The Supreme Court this week stayed an October 2019 Bombay HC order that had quashed the letters rogatory ( LRs ) sent by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence ( DRI ) to several countries in connection with a probe into the alleged Rs 29,000-crore overvaluation of Indonesian coal imports by the Adani Group .

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde issued notices to Adani Enterprises on the appeal filed by DRI against the order of Bombay HC bench of Justices Ranjit More and Bharati Dangre. The SC will hear the matter later this month again.

The Bombay HC order had brought to a halt an overseas investigation by the DRI. It had all the LRs sent by DRI to 14 countries, including Singapore and UAE, seeking information into the alleged overvaluation. An LR is a formal request to another country, seeking judicial assistance in accessing information on an offshore entity in a probe.

DRI is probing at least 40 companies, including the Essar Group, for overvaluation of imports. TOI was the first to report on the scam in its December 14, 2014, edition.

Making it clear that it hasn’t gone into the merits of the LRs, the high court had said: “We have only dealt with the contention as to whether it was permissible for the magistrate to issue such a Letter Rogatory without following the procedure mandated under the Criminal Procedure Code.”

Nashik: The city traffic branch is gearing for their annual ‘Traffic Safety Week ’ which is all set to start from Saturday with series of programmes lined up till January 17.

ACP Mangalsingh Suryawanshi said, a series of programmes like a strict drive against helmetless motorists, health check of the truck drivers, visits of school students at the Children's Traffic Education Park, putting banners of traffic awareness, organising blood donation camps, street plays on traffic awareness, action against illegal transportation of passengers, awareness about carrying driving license, drive to put-up reflectors on buses and auto-rickshaws, etc.

The police said that apart from spreading awareness among motorists they have also started taking strict action against erring motorists from last year due to which the rate of deaths from road accidents dropped considerably compared to the road deaths in 2018.

Police officials said that they aim to see that there are no deaths from road accidents in any part of the city as one death of a person has a bad effect on all his/her family members. The emphasis of the drive would be to encourage motorists to wear helmets as a maximum number of deaths in road accidents are due to head injuries suffered by bikers in the absence of a helmet.

74,['11/01/2020'],"Kolkata: In season of protests, Muslim women make equal statement","Women offer Namaz on Zakaria Street on Friday

KOLKATA: The protests against CAA and NRC on Friday brought to the fore unusual and heart-warming images of several hundred Muslim women offering namaz in the open alongside the men before leading the march in an assertion of their identity as citizens, as well as individuals.More than three hundred women sat in straight rows outside Tipu Sultan mosque in Esplanade to offer their Friday prayers. The elders in the community could not recall any previous instant after Independence where Muslim women not only offered prayers in the open but alongside the men. Women’s rights groups within the community said it showed how ordinary homemakers were leading the protests against the draconian CAA and NRC and also making a statement against patriarchy.Islam gives Muslim women the right to offer namaz in the open or in a mosque, provided proper guidelines about separate space for ritual washing or wazoo enclosures are followed. “There is no restriction on women from offering namaz in open spaces or in the mosques. Instead, the religious scriptures say they should go to the mosque and offer their prayers if there is a separate passage for them and a separate place for ritual washing. When women are travelling, they have to pray in the open. Islam prohibits anybody from blocking another person’s way for prayers,” said Noor Jahan Shakeel, president of All Bengal Muslim Women’s Association.Qari Fazlur Rahman, who leads Eid prayers on Red Road every year, said it was heartening to see women fighting for their rights. “All of us must protest and fight for our rights within the framework of the Constitution,” he said.Offering namaz is mandatory for every Muslim. Friday prayers, which are normally shorter than the midday, or Zohar, prayers on other days, are considered special. On Friday, the protesters — among whom almost half were women — started assembling at Esplanade with the Indian flag in their hands from 11am. The women then approached the organizers and asked for a place to offer their prayers between 12.30pm and 1.30pm.“These women have come from far-off places and would have had to leave early without offering their Friday prayers. We made the provision here instead. Separate arrangements were made for the ritual washing or the wazoo,” said Uzma Alam, a social worker.Before they offer prayers, it is man-datory for Muslims to wash their hands, feet, face, clean their ears and nose and gargle.

RAJKOT: Tired of his frequent drunken fracas and addiction to alcohol, a woman allegedly bludgeoned her 25-year-old son to death in Rapar of Kutch district . The woman, who concealed the crime and presented it as a case of accident, was arrested on Thursday.

According to police, the accused, Navi Koli (55), was fed up of her son Dalpat Koli’s alcoholism and the frequent quarrels he picked up with family members and others after getting drunk.

On January 6, when Dalpat came home drunk and created a ruckus, Navi hit him with a bat on his head. As Dalpat began to bleed profusely, Navi took him to a private hospital in Rapar, where Dalpat succumbed to his injuries. Navi told the doctors that Dalpat had fallen off the staircase.

Next day when the preparations for Dalpat’s last rites were under way, his uncle Mangu Koli got suspicious after seeing the injury marks on Dalpat’s body.

“Mangu was convinced that the injuries inflicted on Dalpat had not been caused by the fall from the staircase. Hence, he called the cops. We took Dalpat’s body to GG Hospital in Jamnagar and conducted the forensic postmortem, which revealed that he had been bludgeoned to death. Following this, we interrogated Navi who confessed to her crime,” said R M Vasava , inspector with Rapar police station.

Navis was arrested on the complaint of Mangu.

PATNA: Work on the Kiul-Lakhisarai railway yard remodelling is going on in full swing. Railways intends to complete this project by March 31 with an aim to further streamline huge traffic operation on this route under Danapur division of the East Central Railway (ECR).

According to ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, railways is also building a new bridge parallel to the 100 years’ old rail bridge at Kiul. “The new Kiul rail bridge has the double track facility for ensuring smooth traffic on UP and Down lines. This work will also be completed by March 31 this year,” he said.

Besides, railways is installing a route relay interlocking (RRI) system at Kiul to replace the old manual lever pulling signalling system. “The RRI is the most advanced signalling system capable of averting any kind of mishap on tracks due to faulty signalling system,” he said, adding railways has already installed RRI system at Jhajha, Patna Junction and Danapur.

Kiul and Lakhisarai are two major stations, which connect Howrah and Delhi ends on the mainline route. While the east end of Kiul-Lakhisarai is linked to Jhajha and Bhagalpur sides, the west end connects Gaya, Patna and Barauni.

“Yard remodelling and advanced RRI system are likely to help railways in clearing traffic bottleneck at this junction point where a large number of passenger trains from both Howrah and Delhi ends pass through,” he said.

On completion of the project, the number of platforms at Kiul will increase from five to eight, giving more passage space for passenger and goods trains. “The remodelling of yard will also increase its capacity, including more space, for stabilizing rakes of passenger trains in the yard,” CPRO said.

Meanwhile, railways has decided to run Darbhanga-New Delhi Bihar Sampark Kranti Express (12565/12566) with Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches from January 17. This train will run with a load combination of 22 coaches.

77,['11/01/2020'],Bihar: ‘Threefold increase in crime against elderly people in 2018’,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: The NCRB data for 2018 paints a grim scenario for another section of the state’s vulnerable population — senior citizens. Crimes against the elderly population in the state grew by nearly three times compared to the previous year.

In 2018, a total of 424 cases of crimes against senior citizens were reported in Bihar as compared to 141 incidents in 2017. However, state capital Patna reported no such crime in the same year. In 2016, the total number of such incidents was 272.

But the rate of crime, which is calculated as the incident per one lakh population, against senior citizens in Bihar was 5.5, less than the crime rates in states such as Madhya Pradesh, Chandigarh and Gujarat, where it was 53.5, 42.1 and 44.4 respectively.

However states such as Assam , Jammu & Kashmir (which was a state in 2018), Jharkhand and Uttarakhand had set example with less than one crime per one lakh population. Meghalaya had zero rate of crime in this category.

In Bihar, 20 elderly people were murdered in 2018, while 42 faced attempt to murder. Two crimes under the category of attempt to commit culpable homicide were also carried out against senior citizens. In the category of simple hurt, a total of 189 incidents were reported, while in the category of grievous hurt, 165 cases were reported.

Interestingly, not a single crime against senior citizens was reported from Patna in 2018. As per NCRB, there were seven such crimes in 2017, which reduced to zero in 2018. A former police official said various steps have been taken to curb crimes against senior citizens. However, he expressed surprise over Patna registering zero cases in 2018.

But a survey conducted by HelpAge India in 2018 on elderly abuse had found that Patna stood at 7th position out of 23 cities in terms of elderly abuse. “Many senior people even after suffering verbal abuse or physical abuse do not go to the police station as they do not want to file complaint against their own family. Also, they have no option, but to suffer such abuses and live with them,” said a retired government employee.

Retired bureaucrat Gopal Shankar Prasad, 75, said most of the heinous crimes like murder of elderly citizens are because of property. “There are cases when the servant carries out theft and when identified, kills the owner. Apart from such issues, why will anyone hurt an old person?” he added.

PATNA: The Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) administration on Friday asked all its doctors to desist from forcing patients to buy medicines from outside. The doctors were also asked not to suggest patients to undergo pathological and radiological tests in private labs. The hospital administration has also asked the doctors to reach their respective departments on time wearing aprons.

The directions came after PMCH principal Dr V P Choudhary made a surprise inspection of outpatient departments (OPDs) of paediatrics, dentistry, gynaecology , orthopaedics, surgery, psychiatry, eye, neurosurgery, plastic surgery and radiology with a team of senior doctors.

Although most doctors were found available on duty, some patients complained to the principal that the medicines prescribed in some departments, including cancer department, were expensive and unaffordable for poor patients who come to PMCH not only from across the state but also neighbouring states and Nepal with great hopes.

Complaints were also made by some patients to the principal regarding pathological and radiological investigations required for ascertaining the disease.

Choudhary said altogether 256 medicines were available free of cost in the hospital and these medicines cover most of the diseases of all branches.

Likewise, about 70 pathological tests and all radiological investigations like ultrasound, CT scan, X-ray, MRI and ECG are available free of cost at the hospital, he said.

As some medicines prescribed for treatment of cancer are usually costly, Choudhary asked the doctors of radiotherapy to take them from the hospital and in no case suggest the patients to bring them from outside.

“PMCH is the only government hospital of Bihar where cobalt therapy for treatment of cancer is available free of cost,” the principal said.

Choudhary asked the heads of departments to regularly arrange ward teaching for students of MBBS and MS and MD as it would help them learn diagnosis and treatment in the company of senior doctors on duty.

MUMBAI: Share prices of Yes Bank closed more than 5% lower at Rs 44.8 on a day when a board member put in his papers alleging governance issues. The bank’s board also scaled down a capital-raising plan to Rs 10,000 crore from Rs 14,000 ($2 billion) earlier and decided not to proceed with a $1.2-billion investment offer by Erwin Singh Braich.In his resignation letter, Yes Bank board member Uttam Prakash Agarwal cited concerns about “deteriorating standards of corporate governance and failure of compliance”. Agarwal said he had issues with the way the bank was going about its equity raising. One of the complaints was the non-disclosure of binding offers from prospective investors.It may be recalled that Yes Bank had last month kept the market guessing on its equity raising plans by announcing that it has received a firm bid for a $1.2-billion investment from North American investors. However, it later disappointed the markets when it disclosed that the investors were little-known persons of Indian origin.While rejecting the offer from Braich, the bank said that the board was in favour of a $500-million offer from Citax Holdings and Citax Investment Group. “However, the relevant conditions precedent could not be completed as on date. Hence, Citax offer will be taken up during the next round,” the bank said.Countering the allegations by Agarwal, the bank said that it was reviewing the ‘fit and proper’ status of Agarwal as directed by the RBI. In this respect, the bank had obtained legal opinions from eminent jurists. “These opinions were to be considered by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the board/the board of the bank in their meetings scheduled for January 10, 2020.

BENGALURU: Online food delivery and restaurant discovery platform Zomato has raised $150 million from its existing backer Ant Financial at a pre-money valuation of $3 billion, according to a stock exchange filing made by its shareholder Info-Edge . The investment is part of a larger round of $500-600 million being raised by Zomato as it continues to battle Swiggy for market leadership in the food delivery space.

Info-Edge, which also owns classifieds portals like Naukri and 99acres , said its stake in Zomato will come down to 25.13% after the deal. TOI had reported in its edition dated March 5, 2019 that Zomato has a set a valuation of $3 billion for its next round of funding. The company has been working with investment banks Goldman Sachs and CLSA for the capital raise.

The development comes as Zomato is in discussions to acquire the India food delivery business of ride-hailing major Uber through a share-swap deal, as TOI reported on November 25. The deal hinges on a potential investment by Uber in Zomato as well.

Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani (File photo)

MUMBAI: In a relief to the Adani Group , the Bombay high court stayed an order of the sessions court, which had last November restored a criminal case against Adani Enterprises ( AEL ), its chairman Gautam Adani and managing director Rajesh Adani for alleged violations of market regulations. Justice A M Badar had on December 20, 2019, stayed the order of the sessions court after the group company, its chairman and managing directors approached the HC in appeal.

The sessions court by its verdict on November 27, 2019, had set aside a 2014 order of a Mumbai magistrate.

The magistrate had discharged (dropped the case against) the Adanis. The accusation was that they had allegedly manipulated share prices of AEL through firms run by stock broker Ketan Parekh. The allegations were also that AEL allegedly “provided funds and shares to Ketan Parekh entities, particularly for the years 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 for running illegal activities in the capital market with dishonest intentions”.

The government had challenged the magistrate’s order in the sessions court. The sessions court had held that the SFIO prima facie made a case of “unlawful gain” by the Adani Group promoters and Parekh of about Rs 388 crore and Rs 151 crore, respectively. The AEL formerly known as Adani Exports, based out of Ahmedabad, is the flagship of Adani Group. The case against them was of cheating and criminal conspiracy too.

In their challenge filed through advocate Ishwar Nankani, and argued by counsel Amit Desai, AEL and the two Adanis contended that the sessions court order be quashed as being “arbitrary and illegal”. It is violation of principles of natural justice and right to equality and right to life, added the appeal.

“Except for bald and general allegation of criminal conspiracy, there is no offence of cheating disclosed against the petitioner (AEL and the two Adanis), and the allegations are groundless.” They did not buy or sell its own shares as is expected under the Companies Act and admitted in the complaint. “Hence, there is no question of them cheating anyone, much less being a party to the conspiracy to cheat,”said the AEL petition.

The company said that the magistrate had rightly appreciated, while allowing its discharge plea, that a “being a juristic entity the company cannot be part of any alleged criminal conspiracy”. The session court has “arbitrarily disregarded” the magistrate’s finding that no case of cheating was made out, the AEL petition in HC said.

The government counsel H S Venegaonkar sought time to file a reply in the HC and the court had adjourned the matter to January 13, 2020.

The project was initially targeted to be completed by December 17, 2018

PATNA: The deadline for ambitious Lohia Path Chakra project in the city has been extended from June 2020 to mid-2021. The project was initially targeted to be completed by December 17, 2018.

Based on swap and grade-separated U-turns and multi-sectional interchange technology at six traffic points – Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) office, Lalit Bhavan, Daroga Rai Path, Punaichak, Patna high court and Vidyut Bhavan – the Lohia Path Chakra project is proposed to do away with traffic signals and check posts on the stretch of Bailey Road between Lalit Bhavan and Hartali Mor.

State road construction minister Nand Kishor Yadav attributed the extension in deadline of the project to the change in its design. “The design of Lohia Path Chakra project was changed twice owing to upcoming Patna Metro Rail and R Block-Digha four-lane road projects. The project is now targeted to be completed in 2021,” the minister said, adding the project also encompasses landscaping and integrated drainage system and software-controlled solar light.

The first phase of the project, comprising stretch of Bailey Road between BPSC office and Lalit Bhavan and Daroga Rai Path, which was initially targeted to be completed by March this year, is now expected to be completed by June this year.

“As part of the first phase of the 3.5km-long road, one flank was opened for vehicular movement on Thursday,” said Yadav.

A BRPNNL official said one flank of Lohia Path Chakra project was opened for vehicular movement to allow construction of underpass on another flank on the same stretch.

“The stretch between BPSC office and Lalit Bhavan witnesses heavy vehicular traffic and congestion throughout the day. Commencement of vehicular movement on one flank will ease traffic movement,” he said.

The official added, “As of now, vehicles coming from Hartlai Mor are being allowed to use the elevated stretch in front of Lalit Bhavan. The underpass parallel to the elevated structure, which is under construction, will be used for vehicles coming from Patna zoo end.”

Meanwhile, work order for preparation of designs for constructing the structures in remaining locations – Punaichak, high court and Hartali Mor – has been allotted to a private firm. A BRPNNL official said the construction work on the remaining locations would take at least one-and-a-half-years more to complete.

Besides the earning from selling insurance, dealers benefit as insured cars come back to them for cashless claims servicing and provide their workshops with assured business.",auto,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73198065,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1752441,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/miscellaneous/lens-on-motor-covers-may-aid-buyers/articleshow/73198068.cms
88,['11/01/2020'],PayU acquires majority stake in PaySense,"This story is from January 11, 2020

(Representative image)

BENGALURU: South Africa’s Naspers ’ fintech unit — PayU — has acquired a majority stake in online credit platform PaySense in an all-cash deal at a valuation of $185 million (Rs 1,312 crore). As part of this deal, PayU will merge its in-house digital consumer credit platform LazyPay with PaySense, the company said. PayU will own about 80% stake in the merged entity, which is being valued at upwards of $300 million (Rs 2,127 crore).

Additionally, PayU has committed an investment of another $200 million (Rs 1,419 crore) into the merged entity, of which $65 million (Rs 461 crore) is being invested immediately. The rest of the capital would come in the next two years based on the company’s performance.

PaySense co-founder Prashanth Ranganathan will head the credit business and continue to hold a stake in the merged entity. PaySense’s financial investors like Jungle Ventures and Nexus Partners will exit the entity after the transaction, which will result in a broader play in the digital lending space by PayU.

While LazyPay has about a million monthly active users on its platform, PaySense has disbursed loans worth Rs 1,000 crore in the last 2.5 years. LazyPay largely offered buy-now-pay-later financing options across online platforms, PaySense offers consumer loans, vehicle loans.

Siddhartha Jajodia, global head of credit, PayU, said this merger will enable PayU to offer full-stack credit solutions. “What this does is it really sets the stage for a combined entity that has all the basic components, all the capabilities, the digital lending stack, the data analytics platform, the ability to acquire customers and now the funding and liquidity power,” he said.

This is aligned with PayU’s broader strategy for financial services in India. Recently, the company invested in online wealth management platform Fisdom while it also acquired Wibmo last year.

Ranganathan said PaySense lends about Rs 100 crore a month now and has a non-performing asset ratio of just under 4%. “We have been very prudent about who we lend to and how much we lend to them. While it’s important to grow our loan book, we have been careful about how responsibly we lend to consumers. Our recovery has gotten better over time. We are almost operating at bank industry level now,” he added.

ARA: Students belonging to various unions tried to disrupt the senate meeting of the Veer Kunwar Singh University, Ara, on Friday morning. They were protesting against the fee hike for postgraduate courses.

Agitating students assembled before the main gate of the VKSU’s new building and tried to block the entrance near the Zero Mile, following which police resorted to lathicharge, which apparently led to a clash between the police and the students. Around half-a-dozen students and a sub-inspector were injured in the commotion.

All India Students' Association (AISA) later released a statement alleging that earlier the students pursued PG courses by spending barely a sum of Rs 2,000 to 5,000 but now they will have to cough up around Rs12,000 to 15,000 for the same and many poor students will be forced to drop out.

Meanwhile, the VKSU senate passed a budget of Rs 637.28 lakh for the fiscal 2020- 21 in its meeting held amid the ruckus on Friday.

Meanwhile, cutting across party lines, all the students’ unions have strongly condemned the police lathicharge on students on Friday. VKSU students’ union president Amit Kumar, who is also a state executive member of ABVP said, “Our democratic right to protest is being suppressed forcibly by the university administration. Now, we will not let the VC to enter the varsity unless he pays heed to our demands. Two ABVP members have fractured their arms and legs and 10 others were injured in the lathicharge.""

The students’ wing of JD (U) also said that Sonu Pandey, Buxar district president of the Chhatra JD (U) and Amit Kushwaha, vice- president of the students’ wing have fractured their hands.

Inkalab Naujawan Sabha district convenor Shiv Prakash Ranjan announced ‘Virodh Divas’ to be held on Saturday against the VKSU administration.

Meanwhile, Bhojpur SP in-charge Sudhir Kumar Porika said police had to resort to lathicharge, when the students started pushing the police.

PATNA: The Union ministry of home affairs has removed state health minister Mangal Pandey and MP Rama Devi from the list of central government protectees.

Following the order, the highly trained CRPF commandos meant for providing VIP security to the duo under Y-plus category security cover were attached to their parent battalion on Thursday, MHA sources said.

Both Pandey and Rama are from BJP. Rama represents Sheohar Lok Sabha seat while Pandey is an MLC.

A senior police officer privy to the development, preferring anonymity, said after the removal of their names from the list, the state now has only five political figures as central government protectees.

“They are Union ministers Ram Vilas Paswan and Ravi Shankar Prasad, MPs Sushil Kumar Singh and Janardan Singh Sigriwal and BJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain,” he said.

Both Singh and Sigriwal are from BJP and represent Aurangabad and Maharajganj Lok Sabha seat respectively.

Sources said Paswan is accorded Z-category security cover of central forces while the other four have Y-plus security cover.

“Home minister Amit Shah and Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari are accorded with floating Z-plus category security. They would be provided the cover on arrival in Bihar,” he said.

One and a half years back, Bihar had at least altogether 17 politicians among the central government protectees getting various categories of security cover.

On July 22 last year, the MHA had removed the names of incarcerated former CM Lalu Prasad Yadav, BJP MP Rajeev Pratap Rudy, party leader Jitendra Swamy, LJP MP Veena Devi, former JD(U) MP Sabir Ali and former BJP MP Uday Singh, now in Congress, from the list of central protectees.

cap

Rajkot: India, which is already battling mounds of garbage , is becoming a dumping ground for solid municipal waste generated by developed countries.

The customs department has blown the lid off a sinister racket of garbage generated in US and Europe being imported under the garb of paper waste in India. The special intelligence and investigation branch of the department has seized 300 containers, which contained nearly 3,000 tonnes filth, at Mundra port.

In the last 10 days, the sleuths checked nearly 1,000 containers of which 300 were seized. The importers of these containers had declared paper waste in their bill of entry.

“This garbage was sent from developed countries like the US and those in Europe. The import of solid municipal waste is banned, but this was being imported in the guise of waste paper,” sources in the customs department told TOI.

Officials said most importers are from Rajkot and Morbi districts and they were getting handsome incentives for accepting the waste. Officials said the waste contained huge quantity of plastic and other household trash like diapers. If dumped in India, it poses a great threat of an epidemic and possibility of radioactive substance being sent is also not ruled out.

These containers were rejected by Indonesia customs last year and they were re-routed to India, which generates nearly 1.5 lakh metric tonnes of solid waste daily. Of this, just about 20% is processed.

Primary investigation revealed that there is a syndicate in developed countries, which are giving hefty incentives to the importers from developing countries just to dump their waste. There are over 20 importers from Rajkot and Morbi and some from Punjab and Delhi.

The customs department has also informed the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB), which is the licensing authority for waste paper import. The union ministry of environment and forest has also issued office memorandums (OM) defining the kind of waste paper can be imported in India, under this OM this municipal waste is illegal.” said a top official of customs.

“We will also issue showcause notices to the importers seeking explanation for misdeclaration and importing prohibited goods. The process of re-exporting these containers to the countries of origin will also be initiated,” a senior official said.

Mentors who took part in the training programme were elated over the learning experience. Vikas Kumar, a lecturer in a government polytechnic college, said, “After attending the session, I am confident of giving business ideas to others, who were previously looking for a government job. Earlier, I thought government job was the best and only solution for employment, but this programme has changed my mindset.”

PM-YUVA is currently being piloted across 12 states in the country. The programme is being run in Bihar with the support of directorate of employment and training, labour resources department, state board of technical education and state science and technology department.

Surat: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials are working hard to regain the ranking for the city that it lost in Swachh Survekshan last year. Surat was pushed to 14th spot from 4th in national ranking last year and in the two quarters of this year, it is at 20th place. Swachh Survekshan of Government of India, being conducted since 2016, is the world’s largest urban sanitation and cleanliness survey and a five-member team would be in the city in next few days for spot inspection and citizen feedback. SMC officials are making people aware of the spots that the team is likely to visit around January 14.

The team members will visit 250 spots in the city and also interact with people. They will visit railway station, bus depots, vegetable markets, processing plants, public and community toilets, commercial and residential localities among other places in the city. They will also check how dustbins are being used, cleanliness of roads, footpaths and encroached upon sites etc.

LUCKNOW: Scores of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) members took out a rally in the city, openly flouting the traffic rules and imposition of Section 144 of CrPC.

The participating bikers were without helmet while those in four-wheelers drove without the seat belt. The rally was taken out from 1090 Crossing till ABVP district headquarters in Kaiserbagh on Friday afternoon.

The rally was organised to welcome the newly appointed office-bearers of ABVP. The outfit’s members wore saffron turbans and followed the motorcade of senior leaders who were in SUVs. The rally also caused traffic congestion, leading to problems for commuters.

Asked whether ABVP had taken permission for the rally, ASP (east) Suresh Chandra Rawat said the organisers had informed them in advance but did not say whether the permission was sought. However, he added, that there was no traffic jam due to the rally as it moved smoothly without stopping anywhere from the starting point till destination. Asked why no action was taken against the ABVP members for flouting traffic norms, Rawat said “they were probing the matter”.

ABVP secretary Ghanshyam Shahi also denied that Section 144 was violated. “Our rally was peaceful and did not cause inconvenience to people,” he said.

Representative image

PATNA: The number of crimes against women in 2018 went up by more than 15% as compared to the previous year, according to data published by the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB). The state saw more than 2,200 cases in 2018 (16,920) as compared to 14,711 such cases in 2017. The number of cases reported in 2016 was 13,400.

The report highlights that in 98.2% rape cases in the state, the culprits were known to the victim.

However, the crime rate against women in Bihar, which is measured as number of incidents of such crime per one lakh population, is much lower compared to the national average across all states, which stands at 57.5. While the rate of such crimes in Bihar is 29.8, Assam has the highest in the country at 166, followed by Delhi with the crime rate of 149.6 per one lakh population.

The categories of crimes included in the NCRB report are rape, kidnapping, assault on women with intent to outraging her modesty, cruelty by husband and relatives and dowry death among others.

Bihar state women’s commission chairperson Dilmani Mishra attributed the rise in the number of crimes against women in the state to more women coming out to report. “Earlier women used to remain quiet, but now education and awareness regarding their rights have made them aware and they report to the police. Also women’s commission, police and the media have given them constant support to fight against atrocities and it is good that they are coming out of their homes,” Mishra said.

The NCRB report also pointed out that that in most rape cases in Bihar, culprits were known to the victim. A total of 651 cases of rape were reported in 2018 in Bihar and in 639 cases, rapists were known to the victim. Most of the known rapists were either friends, online friends or live-in partners or separated husbands accounting for 563 rape cases. Only in 12 cases, rapists were not known to the victim, while seven were family members and 219 were either family friends, neighbours, employers or other known persons. Of the total rape cases reported in 2018, there were eight cases of gang rape.

The data also revealed that 540 rape survivors were in the age group of 18 and 30 years, while 111 rape victims were in the age group of above 30 and below 45 years. There were 16 cases of rape of women between the ages of 45 and 60 years. No rape cases were registered among children below 12 years and there was just one case in the age group of 12 and 18 years.

Apart from rape, the state recorded 106 cases of assault on women and 113 cases of sexual harassment (Section 354 A of IPC). Though no cases of sexual harassment were reported from the work place, 22 such cases were reported from public transport and 91 from other places.

Other assault on women included cruelty by husband or relatives with 2,539 incidents reported, forced miscarriage 20, acid attack 6, disrobing 23, voyeurism 3 and stalking 17 in 2018.

Firefighters douse the flames on Friday

KOLKATA: A mob took over Remount Road in south Kolkata, torching three buses, damaging two others and attacking cops with bricks, glass bottles and iron rods, after a helmetless biker was run over by a Behala-bound private bus near the exit ramp of Garden Reach Flyover on Friday. Five persons, including a woman, were arrested and charged with rioting and arson.

The incident was reported from the spot opposite Kolkata Port Trust Gate 13 around 12.30pm. Three men on a bike were trying to cross the road amidst incoming traffic when the handle of the motorcycle hit a bus on route 12C/1A. The rider, Anil Verma, 35, fell off and by the time the bus driver managed to apply the brakes, Verma’s skull had been crushed under the front wheel.

Verma, a local truck driver, died at the spot and local residents blocked the road, blaming cops for the accident and not allowing them to leave with the body.

“I lost my friend in front of my eyes. We have been demanding speed breakers and more policemen in this area for the past several months, but the cops don’t pay any heed and the place has become an accident-prone zone. We demand justice,” said Sanoj Yadav, another truck driver who was riding pillion with Verma.

When a large team of policemen arrived to lift the blockade, the mob turned violent and began attacking the cops. As the cops ran for cover, a section of the crowd began torching buses that were parked on the road. “It was a scary sight seeing passengers running for their lives. I, too, jumped off my bus and hid behind a shop from where I saw the crowd setting my bus ablaze,” said Maidul Islam, the driver of a route-235 bus.

With the situation spiralling out of control, cops cut off traffic movement on the road and called for backup, including Rapid Action Force personnel, who began a counter attack to drive the protesters away. Traffic movement resumed around 3pm after the burnt and damaged buses were towed away.

Since the collapse of the Majerhat bridge in 2018, almost all Behala-bound buses from north and central Kolkata are being diverted via Remount Road and Hyde Road, increasing the traffic load on the area. “Earlier, we could park our trucks easily and loiter on the road, but since buses were introduced on this route, the place has become accident-prone,” said Shiva Singh, another truck driver.

KOLKATA: After a rainy Thursday, the mercury rose slightly on Friday. At 15.7°C, it was two notches above normal. But the Met office said the mercury will retreat beyond the normal mark by Saturday, making the weekend colder. The day temperature on Friday was 23.1°C.

“We expect the minimum temperature dip to around 13°C by Saturday and go further down to around 12°C the next day. We can expect a good cold spell at least till Tuesday with the northwesterly wind coming in without any obstacles,” said G K Das, director ( weather ) at Regional Meteorological Centre, Kolkata.

On Thursday, the minimum temperature was 15.5°C. The sky cleared up on Friday, making the mercury rise. The Met office said the residual moisture from Thursday’s rain was not allowing the mercury to slide.

Along with the minimum temperature, the day temperature on Saturday will also recede slightly. But the mercury could start rising from Wednesday. Weathermen fear a major western disturbance developing over Jammu and Kashmir could approach this region and push the temperature up. “We can’t yet assess how this will affect our region, but there is a chance of the temperature going up slightly from Wednesday. For now, there is no rain forecast for the city. ” said Das.

This winter, the minimum temperature had dipped to 11.1°C, with the mercury constantly staying under 12°C for a few days. Given the conditions at present, the Met office does not predict the mercury touching the 11°C mark for now.

Work on the gallery, which is spread over an area of 600 square feet, is underway

PATNA: A new digitized ‘Ocean Gallery’ with 14 interactive exhibits, which is being developed on the premises of the Shrikrishna Science Centre (SKSC) at a cost of Rs 30 lakh, is likely to be ready by April.

Work on the gallery, which is spread over an area of 600 square feet, is underway.

“Altogether 14 exhibits will be displayed in different sections on themes like pressure and depth of ocean, ocean current, lights in the ocean, major constituents of sea, birth of ocean, temperature and salinity of oceans, mysteries of ocean, aquarium , ocean pollution, global warming and sea level, geological conditions of oceans, submarines and different types of ships, an SKSC official told this newspaper on Wednesday.

Interactive museum technology is being used for developing the new gallery, which has come up in place of an older gallery inaugurated in 1980. The official said, “We are renovating the previous gallery and adding more space to it so that all the exhibits can be accommodated here.”

SKSC project coordinator Amitabh pointed out that the ‘Ocean Gallery’ would explain the complex world of marine life to the visitors in a simple way by using augmented reality technology.

“This technology superimposes a computer-generated image on what is actually in front of the viewers. For instance, once you enter the ‘Ocean Gallery’, you will find yourself amid snow, penguins, and oceans,” Amitabh said.

He added, “Children will have a better understanding of the important principles and science related to oceans. Some exhibits will explain the Bermuda Triangle , while others will throw light on the scientific reasons behind changes in ocean currents and present challenges due to global warming.”

Earlier in 2019, a ‘Children’s Gallery’ was opened at the SKSC with six sections that included ‘assembly zone’, ‘ride zone’, ‘fairyland’, ‘farmland’, ‘play zone’ and ‘learning zone’. The gallery has altogether 32 exhibits like pyramids, virtual cars and bikes, doll house, robots and tubes.

PATNA: Former Bhagalpur district magistrate (DM) Birendra Prasad Yadav had allegedly signed a government cheque for Rs 12,20,15,075 that was deposited into the bank account of NGO Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti , according to the supplementary chargesheet filed before the special CBI court-II against ten persons, including the 2004-batch IAS officer, in the multi-crore scam case on Wednesday.

Birendra, who is now the special secretary in the Backward and Extremely Backward Class Welfare Department, is the first bureaucrat to be chargesheeted in the scam which is related to fraudulent transfer of government money meant for welfare schemes into the Srijan’s Indian Bank account in connivance with the district administration and bank and cooperative department officials in Bhagalpur district between 2004 and 2014. The scam is stated to involve around Rs2000 crore. The NGO was supposed to impart vocational training to the women in Bhagalpur and adjoining districts.

According to the chargesheet, Birendra as the then Bhagalpur DM had signed a cheque of Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) for Rs12,20,15,075 on September 27, 2014 and it was credited into the Srijan’s bank account with Patal Babu Road branch of Indian Bank on September 30. It is also mentioned in the chargesheet that the signature on the cheque matched with that of Birendra in the forensic examination of central forensic science laboratory (CFSL) at New Delhi.

The amount was actually meant to be credited into a government account with Indian Bank branch. It was opened in the DM’s name after his order to close two old accounts with Oriental Bank of Commerce operational from 2008 and Punjab National Bank from 2010. The transferred amount was of Mukhya Mantri Nagar Vikas Yojana and it was kept in OBC.

Birendra had also signed behind the cheque in favour of Indian Bank’s branch manager, though it should have been in favour of Bhagalpur DM. His signature on the back of the cheque was “blank endorsement given to bank officers”. The bank manager wrote above the Birendra’s signature — “please credit to 822726685 with Indian Bank”. The CBI found in its investigation that the nine digit bank account number was in the name of Srijan.

After the cheque was presented to his branch for clearance, OBC manager Jaideo Singh met Birendra requesting him not to transfer the amount. But Birendra ordered him to clear the cheque the same day, the chargesheet stated. The CBI in its charegsheet has mentioned Singh’s statement that there was endorsement behind cheque for clearance in favour of a specific bank account with Indian Bank which was of Srijan’s and the DM knew it.

According to the chargesheet, the Indian Bank account was opened after Birendra’s subordinate Amrendra Kumar Yadav moved a proposal citing reason that both the old branches were far from the nazarat and it was difficult to operate them. The then DM had singed form to open new account with Indian Bank the same day his subordinate moved the proposal.

However, the CBI in its investigation found that all the three banks were located at the same distance from the nazarat and the Indian Bank’s branch was rather located at a crowded place. The CBI also mentioned in charegsheet that there was no need to close two old accounts and the new one was opened with dishonest intentions.

Devotees at Magh Mela on Friday

Allahabad: Reuniting devotees separated from their families since several decades, it was the first time in years that the organisers at ‘ Bhoole Bhatke Shivir’ weren’t able to do their job on Friday, the inaugural day of this year’s Magh Mela.

The organisers alleged that the Mela police did not allow them to make any announcements and even took away their equipment.

Tiwari said, “We only had two speakers to make the announcements, but the police did not allow our volunteers to use them. We faced unwanted problems throughout the day without the announcement systems. We walked long distances to find the separated persons with their families.”

Tiwari also claimed that their requests to Mela administration for help did not yield any result.

The camp’s volunteers— belonging to different districts\states— have been helping reunite devotees at every Magh Mela, Ardh Kumbh and Maha Kumbh since their patron Raja Ram Tiwari started the tradition in 1946.

This Magh Mela, Mela police set up three lost and found camps on the venue in three separate zones — Parade Ground, Jhunsi and Arail.

On being contacted, IG (Allahabad zone) KP Singh said, “The announcements were stopped only briefly, especially when hardly one or two people were left at the lost and found camp.” The IG claimed that the camp’s volunteers have been asked to make announcements only when it was urgent, so that the misuse of loudspeakers could be checked.

R Balki (left) receives a memento from PIFF director Jabbar Patel

PUNE: Filmmaker R Balakrishnan — fondly known as R Balki — called the late playwright Vijay Tendulkar as “one of the bravest writers” of our time and that he was “more relevant today”.

Balki was this year’s invitee to deliver the flagship Vijay Tendulkar Memorial Lecture at Pune International Film Festival at a multiplex on Senapati Bapat Road on Saturday. Unlike previous years, this year’s “lecture” was organized as a tête-à-tête between Balki and festival director Jabbar Patel.

It was during this interaction that Balki spoke about the legacy of Tendulkar, the pressure on filmmakers to be “different” in a world overflowing with content on various platforms, and his own journey in the world of films.

Tendulkar was a long-time colleague of Patel. Balki too had rubbed shoulders with the noted screenwriters and was full of praise for Tendulkar’s bravery and outspoken nature, despite the fact that his comments often landed him in controversy.

“Tendulkar was the bravest writer of our times and is rather more relevant today. He was brave not only because he was not afraid to speak his mind, but whenever there was disturbance in the society, he didn’t let that disturb him but used it to be more creative,” Balki said.

Balki has ideated and brough to life some popular television campaigns for some of the most recognized brands — from big names in FMCG to luxury jewellery and consumer goods.

And since his foray into films in 2007, with the quirky romance ‘Cheeni Kum’, he also left an indelible mark on filmmaking.

As part of the interaction, Balki also narrated the way he had to shoot the critically acclaimed ‘Paa’, where real-life father-son duo Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan reversed their roles on screen.

“We shot this movie without the VFX (visual effects) and most of the film was shot from the top-down angle to make Amitabh Bachchan look like a child,” he reminisced.

With content of various lengths floating around on platforms that are becoming cheaper and more accessible by the day, Balki acknowledges the challenge that filmmakers and content producers face to differentiate themselves from the rest of the pack.

“Today we are exposed to a lot of content. We see more interesting, weird things happening in people’s lives. There is a lot of pressure on filmmakers to be different and original in such a world,” he conceded.

BJP general secretary Ram Madhav

HYDERABAD: BJP general secretary Ram Madhav seemed to be in a candid mood at a conference at the Indian School of Business (ISB) on Friday as he told the audience that politicians divide society, based on caste for electoral gains. He however added not all caste as an institution was not bad.

He also suggested forming a separate Election Commission cadre as part of electoral reforms to avoid political interference during elections, even as he quoted Jawaharlal Nehru and Karl Marx in his speech.

Speaking at the two-day 'Money power in politics – Indian democracy at work’ annual conference, Madav batted for a liberal democracy and liberal constitutionalism.

He observed that society could run on its own without the interference of the government for 90% of its affairs. According to him, government was needed only for 10% of the time.

He even said that it was ok to lose an election for sake of good governance.

“Indian society was never government-centric, but governments have increasingly made people heavily dependent on them,"" he said and added that power should be contained and regulated.

Madhav did not hesitate to quote India’s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru during his speech. “Nehru was once asked why he was so fascinated by democracy,” he said. “He answered democracy was the second-best available form. He was against asked what the best form was. Nehru answered it was yet to be invented. We are following the best available form of democracy.”

He added, “In democracy, people are supposed to be masters. ‘Government of the people’ is being done, but ‘government for the people’ is partly true and ‘government by the people’ is not followed. The biggest challenge is to make democracy more liberal.”

Madhav quoting Karl Marx’s principle of the ‘withering away of the state’ said that that it is those who are in power who won't allow it to happen. He said Lenin refused to wither away the state as he enjoyed power.

“I am not saying we have to leave it to anarchy. There should be minimum interference of the government, that too at a local level.”

KOLKATA: The ministry of shipping has identified 32-acre riverfront land belonging to the Kolkata Port Trust to develop it into an entertainment and tourism hub. Less than 48 hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurates the sesquicentenary celebrations of Kolkata Port Trust ( KoPT ), minister of state for shipping, Mansukh Mandaviya, announced the plan.

KoPT owns large tracts of land in Kolkata, Haldia, Howrah and the suburbs. The management has been making efforts to use this land profitably.

“The master plan for the development of KoPT’s riverfront land into entertainment and tourism hubs has been drawn out. This is as per the shipping ministry’s vision document to excel in maritime and inland waterway transport. In Phase-I, 32-acre land has been identified for the project,” said Mandaviya.

The minister added that a ship repair facility would also come up in the city. In March 2019, KoPT had signed a concession agreement with Cochin Shipyard Ltd for 15 years. A naval vessel will be the first to be repaired at the KoPT’s dry docks under the banner of CSL Kolkata Ship Repair Unit.

KoPT is the oldest operational port in the country. According to Mandaviya, the port facility has aided in industrialisation, employment generation and major economic activity in the region while serving a vast hinterland in India as well as landlocked neighbouring countries like Nepal and Bhutan.

He quoted predictions by industry analysts while saying that KoPT will continue to grow in the future with new facilities being developed.

More crowd thronged Koyambedu bus stand than anticipated on Friday

CHENNAI: The great Pongal-time migration of city residents to southern and western districts began on Friday evening.

While nearly one lakh passengers left by government special buses and trains on Friday, at least 20% of Chennai’s population are expected to move to their native villages in the next three or four days.

Bookings for special buses on Friday increased by 350% over the normal 4,000 bookings done everyday. But on Friday, close to 18,000 seats were reserved in advance. Of this, 10,200 boarded buses from Chennai Moffusil Bus Terminus (CMBT) at Koyambedu .

Though special arrangements were made by the state transport department, a larger-than-anticipated crowd thronged the bus stand, leading to traffic congestion outside.

Pending flyover work, near the entrance worsened the situation. “Though we reached Arumbakkam in 30 minutes, it took us equal time to cross the 1km stretch after that to reach CMBT,” said Sudarashan who was travelling from Madipakkam to Koyambedu.

Too many vehicles started driving on the wrong side near the traffic signal forcing others to wait for longer than usual, he added.

However, on reaching the terminus, it wasn’t that chaotic except for longer waiting time for buses travelling to Tirunelveli and Nagercoil.

Unlike buses to Madurai or Trichy, frequency to these far-off places was not high and online booking rate was also high for these buses. Only rear seats and those near driver cabins were available, said passengers waiting on platforms 7 and 8.

As far as trains are concerned, Central and Egmore stations were overcrowded and unreserved compartments in all trains were packed. This left passengers, boarding trains at Tambaram, in the lurch and many had to stand near footboards all night to reach their destination.

Exploiting the situation, many private buse operators charged thrice than the normal fare. Since police didn’t allow them to park near CMBT they reached Tambaram and Perungalathur right from 6pm.

CHENNAI: They are casually dressed and act like eager bookworms desperately looking for their favourite title among the thousands on display. What they actually want is just a few seconds of attention away from them so that they can tuck a couple of books under their arms and saunter away.

Such thieves, regulars at almost every such gathering, have become a nightmare for sellers and publishers at the ongoing the 43rd Chennai Book Fair at YMCA in Nandanam . Several stall owners have increased the manpower to ensure nothing is lost. R Vijayakumar, a city-based book dealer who has stocked 20,000 books under 500 titles, says people stealing books is a regular phenomenon. “This year, we have added two more people to keep a close watch on such individuals,” said Vijayakumar, who has set up his stall in the first row.

This year, with nearly two crore books under 15 lakh titles on display in nearly 800 stalls, the threat of theft is high, say sellers. Inquiries made by TOI revealed that those who participated in last year’s edition together lost books valued between Rs 3,000 and Rs 10,000. S Ravi, an associate with a publication, said that 200 to 300 books were stolen during the fair in 2019. “We are clueless about the theft and come to know only during the final accounting. It is difficult to control the menace because our entire concentration will be on assisting genuine buyers and completing the billing process at the cash counters,” he said.

There has been no report of any incident of books being stolen in the current fair, which began on January 9 and is set to continue till January 21, said Ravi.

The usual targets of thieves, say representatives at the various stalls, are the books of leading authors and children’s books. Some sellers stressed that introducing barcodes on book covers and scanning books are sorely needed to prevent theft and to ensure that no book can exit the venue without being billed.

When contacted, R S Shanmugam, president of Booksellers and Publishers’ Association of South India (BAPASI), said that 50 CCTV cameras had been installed at vantage points at the venue and that several volunteers had been tasked with looking out for thieves.

“There have been instances of book thieves being caught and handed over to the police in the past,” he added.

AHMEDABAD: Nearly three years after his death, the famous Gujarati writer Tarak Mehta has been named as an accused in an FIR under the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act filed at Nikol police station in the city, for allegedly using a casteist slur in a Gujarati play titled ‘Ek Murakh Ne Evi Tev’.

In his FIR, Rashmikant Parmar, 33, a trader of machine tools in Kathwada, stated that he had on July 22, 2019 seen the play on a YouTube channel.

“The play, ‘Ek murakh ne evi tev’, has been written by Tarak Mehta, directed by Bharat Shroff and features artists including Mukesh Raval, Santu Rajda, Manish Mehta, Chirag Acharya, Vimal Upadhyay, Jitu Mehta and Anuradha Kanabar,” states Parmar in the FIR.

The play was produced by Rangat Productions and obtained a certificate for broadcast from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), it adds.

“Two minutes and thirteen seconds into the play, actress Anuradha Kanabar delivers a dialogue in which derogatory words are spoken against our caste. Due to this, the dialogue hurts the sentiments of my caste,” Parmar stated.

The writer, columnist, playwright and humorist Tarak Mehta died on March 1, 2017 at his home in Ambawadi in the city at the age of 87. He was also known for the popular Gujarati column ‘Duniya Ne Undha Chashma’. In 2015, he was awarded the Padma Shri for his work.

In his FIR, Parmar said that he had first filed the application of complaint in July 2019, but it took five months to register the FIR. “The FIR was registered only after I met various top police officers, including DCP Zone 5, under whose jurisdiction Nikol police station falls,” said Parmar.

DCP Zone 5, Ravi Teja Vasamsetty said that police would file a C (closure) summary as the accused is dead. “We have also inquired and found that Tarak Mehta has died but as the plea was pending for long, we filed the FIR. We will remove the name of Tarak Mehta during the course of our investigation,” said Vasamsetty.

Apart from Tarak Mehta, eight artists and an unknown member of the CBFC has also been booked under the Atrocities Act.

Nashik: The Nashik rural police helped a complainant from Malegaon get back part of his partial amount after he was duped by an online fraudster a fortnight ago.

The rural police said that on December 25, a complainant got a call on his cellphone, wherein he was told by the unidentified caller about a cash-back offer on an e-wallet, which can be claimed by simply clicking on the link from the cellphone.

The unidentified caller appealed to the complainant to take advantage of the offer by clicking on the link and getting the verification done, said the police.

Meanwhile, when the complainant clicked the link sent on his cellphone, he lost Rs 49,991 from his bank account, which he learned on getting a text message from his concerned bank.

The complainant immediately lodged a complaint with the cyber police station. Acting swiftly, PI Subhash Anmulwar instructed PSI Kalpesh Dabhade and police naik Arti Pardhi to start investigating the case. They took the entire information and checked the cellphone and the link which was sent to him by the fraudster.

The cyber police said that they were unsure to which bank the money was transferred, the cyber police contacted the concerned bank manager and informed him about the fraudulent transaction and sought details of the culprit who had withdrawn part of the money. However, the bank manager froze the further transaction and returned the remaining amount of Rs 24,184 to the complainant.

The police said that they sought details of the concerned conman from the bank so that he can be arrested and the remaining amount of the victim can be returned to him.

Arti Singh, superintendent of police, Nashik Rural said that they appealed to the people to not trust any unidentified phone caller who introduces himself as a representative or officer of a bank or e-wallet and does not give him any personal information of one’s bank account. Further one should also not share the one-time password (OTP) that one receives from a bank to anyone and also not click on the link someone has sent you on the cell-phone.

While experiences are many, the response to it is only one—avoid or ignore the situation and person.

LUCKNOW: A lewd comment while getting onto a bus, a hand ‘accidentally’ brushed against the chest while getting off a tempo or train or a song with vulgar lyrics directed at them by the cab driver—these are just a few forms of harassment faced by women on a daily basis while travelling in public transport.

While experiences are many, the response to it is only one—avoid or ignore the situation and person.

For the past seven years, Spraha Magan has not taken a bus to commute.

The 27-year-old has not been able to forget a traumatising incident she went through in 2013.

“It was just a regular day for me. I took the bus to college. In the morning, buses are generally packed and many men take advantage of this to misbehave with women. However, I had not faced something like that till that day. I was sitting in the aisle seat when a middle-aged man started rubbing his private parts on my shoulder. I was so shocked that I could not react. The bus was packed so nobody noticed. I was so traumatised that I could not take a bus again,” said the Singarnagar resident.

There are many like Spraha who face harassment or embarrassment every day. Karishma Rajawat, a bank employee, was in for a rude shock during an auto-rickshaw ride with her friends.

“We were going to Indiranagar from Hazratganj. We were busy chatting until my friend noticed in the rear-view mirror that the driver was masturbating. She immediately stopped the auto, asked us not to pay and jump out. The driver also understood and left in a rush. People don’t understand but incidents like these leave a huge impact on our lives. It gets difficult to move on,” said Rajawat (33). A similar case happened on November 13, 2019, when a 21-year-old graduate student had to jump off a moving tempo (three-wheeler) because she was being harassed by the driver who asked her to remove her scarf and share her number.

Parul Kushwaha (name changed on request) recalls how a man in a train to Delhi in March 2019 was harassing her.

“I was so scared that I began shouting. Soon, people gathered and began thrashing him. It is difficult because we freeze but shouting out loud is the only immediate rescue,” she added.

Even app-based cabs, which are believed to be safer, are not free of such incidents.

119,['11/01/2020'],Vikram 2nd kin to retain deceased corporator’s seat,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Before Vikram, Congress corporator Kamlesh Chaudhary had retained seat after his father Dilip’s death in 2007

Nagpur: BJP candidate Vikram Gwalbanshi has become the second kin to retain a seat left vacant due to a sitting corporator’s death in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) history. Vikram comfortably won the byelection from ward no 12 (D) on Friday.

Before Vikram, Congress corporator Kamlesh Chaudhary had retained seat after his father Dilip’s death in 2007.

Following the demise of four-time BJP corporator Jagdish in April last year, the saffron party nominated his son Vikram, activist of BJP Yuva Morcha, in the byelection. Of the total 22,151 polled votes, Vikram secured 13,386 votes (60.43%). Vikram’s victory margin was 9,636 votes.

Congress’s Pankaj Shukla polled only 3,750 votes, followed by Ashok Dorlikar (independent, 2,617), Praful Ganvir (Bahujan Bharip Mahasangh, 1,556), Akash Kawle (Aam Aadmi Party, 690), and NOTA (152).

A resident of Makardhokda, Katol Road, Vikram is third from his family to get elected as a corporator. Besides his father, Vikram’s mother Aruna was also a corporator for one term.

With city Congress president Vikas Thakre winning from West Nagpur three months ago, the party failed to grab the seat from BJP’s pocket even after Jagdish’s demise. A slew of BJP leaders, including city MP and Union minister Nitin Gadkari, campaigned for Vikram.

NMC sources said that even a couple of Congress corporators extended their support to Vikram as a tribute to Jagdish.

Thakre said the byelection was a wave of sympathy towards Jagdish, who was corporator for 17 years and in public touch for the last 30 years. “People’s sentiments towards Jagdish worked in Vikram’s favour. Jagdish was a simple and good person. I got a big lead from this ward in assembly elections. Therefore, this byelection cannot be compared with the political situation prevailing in the district and state. Congress won by a clear majority in zilla parishad elections. The same results will be seen in 2022 municipal elections,” he said.

Of the remaining three corporators from the ward, two — Harish Gwalbanshi and Darshini Dhawad — are from BJP. Former mayor Maya Iwnate is also from BJP.

Thanking Gadkari and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis for showing faith in him, Vikram said his victory was a real tribute to his father. “All from the ward loved my father for his developmental works. I will continue to work for people’s welfare and development and provide all basic amenities in my ward just like my father,” he said.

This was the second byelection in NMC’s current regime since February 2017. After the demise of BJP corporator Nilesh Kumbhare, Sandip Gavai of the same party was elected in October 2017 from ward 35 (A). Hence, the BJP has maintained its seat count of 108 in NMC’s house of 151.

Nagpur: Professor Vijay Barse , on whose life acclaimed director Nagraj Manjule has produced Amitabh Bachchan-starrer film ‘Jhund’, concluded his three-day ‘maun vrat’ (silent protest) by addressing some teachers’ organizations and his supporters at Samvidhan Square on Friday. The film is yet to be released.

Barse said he stands in solidarity with the nation and students and will continue to support them whenever attacks like the one on Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students are committed. “I did my bit of penance by remaining silent for three days, which is painful for a teacher,” he said.

Barse also extended support to ‘We the People of India’ protests which will kick off from Saturday at Samvidhan Square and continue till January 14. “ I will be there and listen what the youth are saying,” he said. He called for peace in the country and protection to students. “In the 1970s, students of Nagpur University were under attack. Then too, I had stood up to protect the students,” he recalled.

“Everyone must condemn attacks on institutions and students,” said Barse.

Meanwhile, organizers of ‘We the People of India’ have appealed to the people to join the stir against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) / national register of citizens (NRC) and the national population register (NPR) by gathering at Samvidhan Square in large numbers.

Maharashtra assembly speaker Nana Patole is likely to visit the protest site on January 13 or 14. On Saturday, guardian minister Nitin Raut too would meet the protesters.

Nagpur: Every season has its beauty embedded in it in the Indian context. And it was Kalidasa who brought out the best of nature in his long poem ‘Rutusamhara’ which was presented in a dance form that made the audience bask in the glory at Suresh Bhat Sabhagruh, Reshimbagh on Friday.

Organized by Kavikulaguru Kalidas Sanskrit University (KKSU) as part of two-day cultural programme, artistes of Bharat College of Fine Arts, Mumbai, were in their element while depicting six seasons — Grishma, Varsha, Sharad, Hemant, Shishir and Vasant.

The Bharatanatyam dancers swayed with words of the great poet as they unfolded the characteristics of summer, monsoon, autumn, cool, winter and spring. Human emotions of love and longing associated with monsoon in particular were marvellously showcased.

Nature and animal kingdom are inseparable as they act differently when it comes to manifestation. The artistes swirled while presenting postures of animals like swan, frog and deer. Sandhya Purecha and troupe from Mumbai did it with ease. So was presentation of ‘shringar rasa’. They also presented a small piece portraying the romance between Radha and Krishna.

Artistes of Rajendra and Nirupama of Abhinav Dance Academy, Bengaluru, presented three segment sequences highlighting the story of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Their performance showcased the journey of Rama and Sita and their lives in Panchavati. Rajendra and Nirupama as Rama and Sita were elegant.

The second segment was dedicated to the romance between Shakuntala and Dushyant. The duo then performed a jugalbandi of Kathak as their ghungroo-laden feet moved swiftly, with matching facial expressions.

Their presentation concluded on a powerful note as they presented ‘veer rasa’, narrating the story of Abhimanyu (Naveen Hegde), who was caught in the ‘chakravyuh’.

Kishor and Kishori Hampiholi of the city were at their best, narrating the story of Amrapali and her journey towards embracing Buddhism after she meets an influential monk in the dance drama.

LUCKNOW: Lucknow residents reeled under ‘cold day’ conditions as dry icy winds swept the city on Friday.

Even the sunshine did little to bring any relief from the biting cold.

The gusty wind will continue to lash the city till Sunday accompanied by moderate to dense fog in the morning. Temperatures, however, will rise on Monday and Tuesday, followed by possibilities of thundershowers on Wednesday and Thursday.

The western disturbance (WD) responsible for Wednesday’s rain and Thursday’s overcast sky fizzled out on Friday. The phenomenon led to the revival of northwesterly winds coming from the hilly areas, which witnessed snowfall recently.

As the sky was clear overnight, the minimum temperature dropped to 7 degrees Celsius, a degree below normal. Icy winds condensed the moisture left behind by rain into fog in the morning, but the haze cleared by 9am due to the winds. The wind speed was recorded as 15km/hour.

As a result, despite the sunshine, the maximum temperature – peak value of mercury during the day – was restricted to 16.8 degrees Celsius, five units below normal. As per meteorological terminology, such a state is referred to as a ‘cold day’.

State Met director JP Gupta said, “Two WDs are expected to hit the hills next week. The one on Monday (January 13) will cut off the flow of icy winds towards plains, resulting in a rise in temperatures across the state. It may cause rain in the western part of UP, but the eastern region will generally remain dry. The WD will disintegrate by January 14.”

“The second WD is expected on Wednesday (January 15) and would make the weather conducive for rain or thundershowers across the state on January 16-17,” he added.

NAGPUR: Sakshi Chokhandre, 15, a student of Standard IX, committed suicide by hanging with a scarf from ceiling rod at her residence at Kadu Layout on Thursday. The reason for her act was not clear. Her father, Shashikant, had ended his life at a friend’s place in May last year.

The family members, still clueless about the reason behind Sakshi’s drastic step, are trying to connect the daughter’s suicide with her father’s as they had a special bond despite staying separately. The family sources claimed Shashikant’s suicide seemed to have adversely affected Sakshi. Shashikant, an autorickshaw driver, used to stay with a friend at Indora and not at home as he had a difference with wife Seema who supported the family by working at a hostel.

A relative said Sakshi had developed some uneasiness for the last couple of days. “She was normal and had done household chores earlier in the day. There was no indication from her words or even mood to gauge she would take the step later in the day. She had also spoken at length with a neighbour,” said the relative. “There was some frustration within her which may have compelled her to take the decision to end life,” he said.

The family members also informed Sakshi was a good student and had scored well in her Standard VIII final examinations.

It is learnt Seema had advised Sakshi to go her maternal uncle’s place which is in the vicinity before leaving for work as she had complained of uneasiness. Sakshi’s elder sister, Anchal, was at her maternal uncle’s place. Anchal was expecting Sakshi to reach at maternal uncle’s place too. As she did not turn up, Anchal and her maternal grandmother Sanghamitra went to Sakshi’s place to enquire about her health.

Anchal and Sanghamitra got worried as there was no response from inside after repeated knocks on the door. They alerted a neighbour who came to their help. She spotted Sakshi hanging from the ceiling after peeping through the window. Police were alerted. No suicide note was found. Kapil Nagar police have registered a case of accidental death.

CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Friday called for reports from more than 40 returning officers (RO) of the recently concluded rural local body election on whether they conducted recounting of votes as per the request by DMK candidates, if not the reason for the same.

Justice PD Audikesavalu passed the interim order on a batch of petitions alleging that the retuning officers concerned have not recounted votes in some wards where a request for recounting has been made despite the provisions of Panchayat Election Rules which mandates such recount if sought for in accordance with law.

The judge also orally observed that the court would direct departmental action against errant returning officers if it is found that they did not follow the rules pertaining to recounting.

This apart, the judge also heard another plea moved by the DMK, seeking direction to the Tamil Nadu state election commission to video graph with audio recording the entire proceedings of the indirect election to the posts of chairperson and vice chairperson of district panchayat council and panchayat union council to ensure free and fair election and to police protection for the election. When the plea came up for hearing, the court recorded the undertaking of the election commission that it will provide three tier protection and video recording of the election without audio recording.

Inspector Balvantaiah.(File photo)

HYDERABAD: Jubilee Hills inspector Balvantaiah, the main accused in a bribery case, who was absconding, surrendered before the Anti-Corruption Bureau ( ACB ) sleuths on Friday.

Balvantaiah told the police that he abruptly left bandobust duties at Krishnakant Park on Thursday afternoon and left in an auto to attend to his ‘ill’ wife.

On Thursday afternoon, the ACB team had arrested Jubilee Hills SI P Sudheer Reddy while demanding and accepting Rs 50,000 and two whiskey bottles as bribe from complainant M Vamsi Krishna Chowdary. Sudheer spilled the beans and said that he was acting upon the instructions from Balvantaiah.

After arresting the SI, the ACB team made him call the inspector to verify the veracity of his claims.

“Balvantaiah disconnected the SI’s call and called him back through WhatsApp. When the SI explained that the complainant gave Rs 50,000 and two bottles of whiskey, Balvantaiah reminded him saying that the initial agreement was for Rs 1 lakh. Subsequently, Balvantaiah told the SI to take the bribe and enquired about another complaint involving a woman. The SI told the inspector that both the parties agreed for a settlement on their own. The conversation was recorded in the presence of witnesses,” said an ACB official.

After laying the trap, the police team took the SI to Jubilee Hills police station to arrest the inspector there. However, after reaching the station, they realised that he was on bandobust duty at Krishnakant Park. Meanwhile, Balvantaiah changed into civilian clothes inside his official vehicle and left the place in an autorikshaw.

“ACB sleuths then told senior officials of Hyderabad commissionerate to call him, but Balvantaiah did not answer their calls. An hour later, his phone was switched off,” said a police source.

Balvantaiah’s house in Vanasthalipuram remained locked and his four phones were switched off. After the ACB sleuths launched a manhunt for him, Balvantaiah surrendered before the ACB officials at their head office in Banjara Hills on Friday.

The inspector told the interrogators that he forgot the cell phones, tab and wallet inside the official vehicle. However, ACB said that the team did not find the items in the vehicle. “Balvantaiah remained silent when asked if he had demanded the bribe and asked the SI to collect it,” said an ACB official. The accused were suspended by Hyderabad CP Anjani Kumar .

PUNE: Maharashtra is yet to receive the notification on the National Population Register ( NPR ) drive to be carried out between April and September across the country, Census department officials have said.

The Centre has issued a directive, instructing the head of a family to make available details of 21 identifiers during the enrolment in the National Population Register (NPR). Among the identifiers are driving licence and Aadhaar, Permanent Account Number and voter ID cards.

Senior officials in the Census department have undergone training for the work during the past three months. “We have completed our training and are awaiting official orders from the government,” an official said on Friday.

The nationwide NPR is supposed to be held from April 1 to September 30 to record the “usual residents” of the country who have lived in an area for the past six months or more or people who intend to stay there for the next six months or more, an official notification stated.

In Maharashtra, the drive was supposed to start in May and end by June. However, Congress cabinet minister Varsha Gaikwad earlier this week issued a statement that the Maha Vikas Aghadi would not allow the rollout of the drive for the NPR in May.

Several state governments have stopped work on the NPR, claiming that it was the first step toward the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that would be used in conjunction with the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

LUCKNOW: Union ministry of civil aviation has sacked Amethi-based Rajiv Gandhi National Aviation University (RGNAU) registrar Jitendra Singh with immediate effect. Singh has been replaced by Garima Singh, who holds the director’s position in the civil aviation ministry.

The order (a copy of which is with TOI), issued on Wednesday by under-secretary of the ministry Kameshwar Mishra, stated: “Order of the competent authority is hereby conveyed for the termination of probation of Jitendra Singh, registrar, RGNAU, with immediate effect. Singh, accordingly, stands removed and relieved from the position of the registrar with immediate effect.”

The order added that Singh was directed to vacate the office immediately and his official residence within seven days. Singh, the first registrar of RGNAU, was appointed by the President in April last year. The university, the first of its kind, commenced its academic session in August last year.

As per the order, Garima has been appointed as acting registrar till further notice. She would be serving in RGNAU in addition to her existing duties and responsibilities in the ministry, read the order.

According to reports, RGNAU acting vice-chancellor Amber Dubey, who is also a joint secretary in the ministry, entered the campus along with police personnel and Garima on Thursday and asked Singh to immediately vacate the office.

NASHIK: The city police have booked a 23-year-old youth for selling nylon manja and have confiscated the banned product worth Rs 7,000 from him.

The nylon manja (string) is used for flying kites . The sale of manja, however, has been banned in the city for various reasons and strict action is being taken against those selling nylon manja.

On Wednesday at around 8 pm, the Bhadrakali police received a tip-off about a person selling nylon manja in front of the Nanawali Masjid in the Bhadrakali area. Taking serious cognizance of the information, police laid a trap and caught the suspect red-handed.

They confiscated manja worth Rs 7,000 from the suspect and booked him under various sections of the Indian Penal Code.

The action was conducted under the guidance of commissioner of police Vishwas Nangre-Patil and deputy commissioner of police Amol Tambe.

Bhadrakali police said that the commissioner has instructed police officials to conduct patrolling by foot in the morning and evening hours in their respective jurisdictions.

Police said that the action against people selling nylon manja was necessary as the product is extremely dangerous and can cause serious injury. With the festival of Makar Sankranti around the corner, revellers throng city markets for buying kites and manja. Police said that their only concern was to ensure that people do not buy nylon manja as its sale and use is banned.

Police officials also said that their action against the banned product will continue. They also said that, last year, they had sent decoy customers in civil uniforms to various shops to check if nylon manja was sold anywhere.

In addition, police will also keep an eye on revellers to see if anyone is buying or using the banned product.

NAGPUR: Motorists are left to face pothole menace and bad surface layer on nine roads for the last nine years due to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation ’s (NMC) inordinate delay in completion of phase-I of Cement Concrete Road Project and early exit of contractor Mumbai-based Unity Infraprojects Pvt Ltd.

They will have to wait for a few more months as the qualified contractor — Kamptee-based Abhi Engineering — has refused to accept work order due to delay by the NMC in issuing it.

The NMC’s projects department tabled a proposal before the standing committee seeking approval to offer work to second followed by third lowest bidders Mahalsa Constructions and JP Enterprises, respectively, or go for re-tender in case the two companies refused to work on the rate quoted by Abhi Engineering. The committee will take a decision on the proposal in a meeting on January 14.

As per the proposal, Abhi Engineering refused to execute the work on December 12, 2019, citing inordinate delay from the NMC. Financial bids in the tender were opened on August 6, 2019. As per rules, the department has to take approval of the standing committee and issue letter of acceptance (LoA) to qualified contractor within 120 days from opening of bids.

The department tabled the proposal seeking the standing committee’s approval on September 5, 2019. But the committee delayed giving approval for reasons best known to it.

Standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane told TOI that all efforts will be taken to begin works at the earliest. “Approval was delayed due to code of conduct for assembly elections,” he said.

The chances of other two bidders taking the work at the rate quoted by Abhi Engineering seem bleak. Abhi Engineering has quoted Rs35.50 crore, Mahalsa Constructions Rs47.17 crore and JP Enterprises Rs 51 crore. The works on nine roads are difficult to execute as they require shifting of utilities. Besides, there are problems of land acquisition and removal of encroachments.

The NMC had appointed Unity to concretize 30 roads with a length of 26.84km on June 6, 2011, with a deadline of two years. But it could concretize only 20 roads till January 2019. Citing liquidation, Unity had obtained early exit from the project in March.

Due to pending concretization work, the NMC did not asphalt nine roads and is doing patch works for the last nine years. These roads comprise potholes and bad surface layer. Now, the NMC will take some more months to finalize the contractor, followed by deadline of three years.

Hyderabad: Heritage experts on Friday called for periodic inspection and maintenance of temples as a step towards preservation of heritage structures. Speaking at a conference on the ‘Dynamics of Hindu Temple Architecture’ in the city on Friday, conservation architect SP Anchuri said, “Inspections must be carried out every three to six months at temples.” To ensure there is no neglect, he suggested that the endowments department constitute a technical team to oversee preservation of the temples along with the managements.

“Most of these temples built thousands of years ago with stone and wood are stable by themselves, but human activity and natural calamities disturb this. Often the reduction of water table results in the sinking of temples,” said Anchuri.

Citing the example of the Thousand Pillar Temple, which required foundation work, he said that the original technology must be studied for any restoration process. The conservation architect also said that human interventions such as the provision of lighting or cooling systems in temples must be done in a way that does not mess with the heritage structures.

Anuradha Reddy, convenor, INTACH Hyderabad, said, “in the name of development, the identity of Telangana temples is being lost.” She said Dravidian elements are being included where such influence does not exist. “We see enamel being put, bathroom tiles being used and holes being drilled into granite at several temples. Pilgrim facilities where natural light and ventilation were the norm, are being transformed with air conditioning and artificial lighting,” she added.

Speaking of the Sitaram Bagh temple and the diversity of influence, she said, “The temple has Qutb Shahi, Rajasthani and local influence. Most temples in the state have no single style of architecture.”

Reddy, who has been recording temple architecture across the state, also warned that there is “little information on Telangana temples and more needs to be done in this regard.”

Nashik: District collector Suraj Mandhare has decided to come with the latest gazetteer reflecting the true identity of modern Nashik to attract foreign investments in the state.

After the first gazette was published by the British in 1883, the district administration published the second gazetteer in 1975 with some changes. “A comprehensive document featuring modern Nashik – is missing and hence we have decided to bring a new gazetteer which will attract foreign investments in this part of the state,” Mandhare told TOI.

The gazetteer to be published now will take everything in its stride right up to the modern-day. “All this information will be packed and presented to the visiting dignitaries who go by the government information about the particular region,” he said.

The collector will call upon the citizens to contribute to history, geography, local economy, phases of agriculture, climate, industries, art, culture, forest, and rivers, the specialties of the locals and their traditions and ethos, and the education sector of the city.

On preparation of the gazette, the officer said that a district-level the committee has been formed to collect, validate and moderate the information received from the contributors and include the same only after thoroughly examining the facts and eliminating the controversies. “Often when the foreign delegates visit Maharashtra, the best thing they rely on is on the gazetteer. If the document is 45 years old just imagine what could be the information they were getting. We have therefore in our meeting asked the people to come up with the authentic data on various parameters including health and water conditions which will speak about the quality of life in the region,” the collector said.

The district committee has met for the first time on the agenda and chalked out some plans for the same. In the next meeting, the committee will assign responsibilities and time-line before which the gazetteer has to be completed.

The gazetteer is excepted to be published in two volumes with each having 1600 pages. It will have 12 different topics including agriculture, tourism, economy, etc.

HYDERABAD: With Sankranti just a few days away, most trains and buses, especially those heading to Andhra Pradesh, are seeing a heavy surge in passengers. Passengers complain that the arrangements are insufficient despite announcements by South Central Railway (SCR) of running special trains and buses.

M Rama Raju, who goes to Kakinada each year, said, “Most buses and trains are full or have long waiting lists. I have been trying to book my seats for the past one week, but no tickets are available.”

Another passenger, Harish Kumar, who booked train tickets two months ago, is still on the waiting list. “I booked two tickets in 3AC and my tickets are still not confirmed.”

This year, Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) introduced 4,000 special buses, while SCR is running 442 special trains between various destinations of the zone from January 5 to 25. Officials from TSRTC said that people travelling to their hometowns have increased compared to last year.

“Since many people couldn’t go to their hometowns during Dussehra because of RTC strike, the number of bookings is more for Sankranti,” said J Devadanam, TSRTC divisional manager, Kukatpally.

Meanwhile, the number of passengers in Secunderabad , Kacheguda and Nampally stations have increased considerably in the past couple of days. “Compared to last year, we are operating 200 additional trains this time.

Allahabad: A 52-year-old woman died after she and her partner were brutally attacked at their home by two unidentified men in Lohgara village, under Bara police station, late Thursday night.

Police said that the deceased was identified as Sunita, while her husband Lalmani Kushwaha is undergoing treatment at hospital.

Lalmani told police that the accused attacked Sunita with sticks and rods around 1am, when she had gone to open the main door of the house when someone called them from outside the house.

“When she went to open the main gate, two unidentified armed men attacked her on the head, leaving her critically injured,” said SSP Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj.

“The men also thrashed Lalmani, when he tried to save Sunita,” the SSP added.

Local residents rushed the two to the hospital, but Sunita was declared brought dead.

“Sunita and Lalmani were not married and the former had left her husband around 20 years back. The two had been living together ever since. Lalmani too had left his wife around 23 years back and had two sons with her,” said the SSP. Police, however, said that the family of the deceased claimed that the two were married.

Pankaj said, “Sunita did not get along with Lalmani’s two daughter-in-laws. A police team has been assigned the case.”

A a case under sections 302, 34 and 323 of the IPC has been lodged at Bara police station against two unidentified persons on the basis of a complaint by Lalmani. No arrests have been made in the case so far.

147,['11/01/2020'],Dist admin issues DO letter over lack of data on plantation,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Nashik: The district administration, taking strong note of the failure of several government offices in providing data of survival of the saplings planted during monsoon despite reminders, has served a demi-official ( DO ) letter warning of strict action on Monday.

“A letter has been sent by district collector Suraj Mandhare, who is also the president of district committee on plantations, after the offices failed to report the data on plantations carried out in monsoon,” a senior official from the district administration stated.

The DO letter has been issued to Nashik and Malegaon Municipal Corporations, public works department, water resources department, project officer tribal department (Nashik), Commissioner Sales Tax, superintendent of state excise department, among others.

Generally, DO is an ultimatum issued by a senior office to others in case of failure of the respective offices to comply by the orders, letters and reminders sent before.

Under ministry of forest’s ambitious 33 crore plantation programme, 1.97 crore plantation target was assigned to Nashik in which all government departments were asked to participate.

As per the programme, the departments were expected to provide detailed information about plantations carried out by them and the survival of the same to the district committee headed by the district collector.

The BJP government from 2014-19 had drawn up the plan for planting 33 crore saplings across the district under the stewardship of state forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar.

In all 35 government departments, including collectorate, local civic bodies, zilla parishad offices and departments, among others, were given the task that was to be carried out from July to October.

By the end of October, the departments were expected to report their data of plantation and the survival statistics as well. However barring a few departments, many have failed to send their reports.

Hyderabad: The AP government, which has been demanding shifting of Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) office to Vijayawada, seems to have dropped the demand for now as it is grappling with protests over CM Jaganmohan Reddy ’s three-capital proposal. The YSRCP government, which proposed capitals at Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool, on Thursday did not seek shifting of KRMB office as tri-capital proposal was being examined by a committee.

KRMB chairman RK Gupta decided to take up office shift issue after getting clarity on capitals. AP government has been demanding KRMB office be located in their state as a major portion of the Krishna basin is in their territory.

Telangana chief secretary Somesh Kumar, AP special chief secretary Adityanas Das and irrigation officials from both states attended the meeting. “Telangana is likely to get 140 tmcft of Krishna water, while AP 84 tmcft for both irrigation and drinking water purposes till May,” sources said. KRMB might issue formal order on Friday.

Official sources said the Board members discussed accounting of excess water (flood water) about 130 tmcft used by AP in the past few months. While AP government’s argument was flood water cannot be considered excess water, Telangana said flood water drawn from major projects such as Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar, Pulichintala and Jurala were located on the main bund and would not be taken into consideration, but AP government had drawn water from other sources. “Both states agreed to discuss the issue during Telangana and AP CMs’ meeting scheduled to be held on January 13 or constitute a sub-committee to decide,” a senior irrigation department official from Telangana said.

Telangana urged KRMB to consider 20% allocation made for drinking water purpose as regenerated water, being used for drinking water purposes in Hyderabad. KRMB authorities reportedly informed the two sides that the issue would be referred to Central Water Commission (CWC). The meeting also discussed water diversion to right canal from Polavaram and cross bunds constructed on Nagarjunasagar left canal.

LUCKNOW: Safety is largely compromised in elite Indiranagar where every second commercial building is illegal. They violate the construction code either fully or partly, putting thousands of lives at grave risk every day.According to Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) records, there are 221 commercial units and shops in Indiranagar. Of these, 136 or more than 61% have been declared illegal in the past three years because they ignored LDA rules and have no fire department NOC.While notices were served to all along with demolition warning, the LDA thereafter failed to act. Now, its new vice-chairman Shiwa Kant Dwivedi has ordered a probe into why action was not taken against unauthorised constructions, directing officials to issue fresh notices.A TOI reality check revealed that fire safety was questionable in most of these commercial complexes, which also allowed shops to operate from basements meant for parking. As a result, people park vehicles on the road, leading to traffic snarls.In Sector 10, a five-storey shopping complex had fire safety equipment only at the owner’s office. “Scores of people visit this place daily. Such negligence can cost lives,” said Upendra, a shopper.Yet another shopping compex on Takrohi Road in Sector 14 was found without mandatory blaze battling equipment. “A fire in one shop can burn down the whole building. We risk our lives to work here. The owner doesn’t pay heed to our pleas,” said Krishna Ranjan, a shopkeeper.At another shoppers’ stop near Lekhraj market, live wires were found dangling everywhere. “These are death traps. Despite complaints, no action has been taken by the owner, I hear,” said Kamal, a customer.At the same building, shops also run from the basement. “Customers park their vehicles on the pavement or along the carriageway. When shopper footfall is high inside, there is severe traffic congestion outside,” said Pawan Chaurasiya, a commuter. LDA chief engineer Indu Shekhar Singh said the process to serve “final notices” to all these commercial units had begun. “The process will take a month. Thereafter, we will give seven days to take corrective measures before starting a demolition drive,” he added.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73197585,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-421189,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/every-second-commercial-bldg-in-indiranagar-illegal/articleshow/73197064.cms

Representative image

NAGPUR: The annual meet and workshop of an association representing school principals on Thursday resolved to focus on child security as well empowering its members to prepare students for government scholarships exams.

School Headmasters Charitable Association ( SHCA ) invited various subject experts, including city cops, RTI activists and education officials to guide principals at the workshop.

Zafar Khan, founder-president of SHCA, said, “This is the seventh edition of our annual meet and workshop where our aim is to make principals aware of various issues that they face as administrators and make them able to take crucial decisions. Also, we have made it our mission to prepare students for scholarship exams like National Talent Search (NTS) and National Means cum Merit Scholarship ( NMMS ).”

Shivling Patve, education officer (secondary) for Nagpur district, said, “NMMS and NTS used to get high number of applicants from Nagpur, but that’s not the case anymore. Schools must try to create awareness about these important exams as they help students to prepare for competitive exams later on in life. Students are looking at a scholarship of Rs1,000 per month through these exams.”

To take this forward, Khan said another workshop will be held to make schools aware of NMMS and NTS. “We have now made it our mission and will be roping in NGOs to help pay the exam fee of any student who is unable to do so,” said Khan.

For safety and security of children inside schools, senior police inspector Ashok Bagul said it was important for principals to be aware of the law. “To hit a child is crime, be it a teacher or parent. There must be complete clarity on this among principals. It’s not like when we were kids and our teachers would wallop us without anybody batting an eyelid,” said Bagul.

Umesh Rathod, deputy education officer, talked about responsibilities of principals. “It is important for schools to follow procedure for everything, right from correspondence to hiring personnel and maintaining records,” said Rathod.

RTI expert and trainer Naveen Agarwal spoke to principals about the laws governing it. He talked about the responsibility of the school after it receives an RTI application and gave details about the timeline, type of information to be given and records to be kept.

SHCA secretary Dilip Bose and treasurer Sundip Gaikwad said that the association will continue to organize more workshops and facilitate interaction between their members and experts from various domains.

CHENNAI: Actor and MNM president Kamal Haasan on Friday continued to nudge ‘superstar’ Rajinikanth to partake in the process to develop Tamil Nadu .

“Every citizen and Tamils have a role and responsibility in the development of Tamil Nadu,” Kamal Haasan told reporters. By virtue of being a citizen, Rajinikanth too has a responsibility to play his role to develop the state, Kamal added.

The MNM chief was taking off from where he left on Thursday, when he suggested that Rajinikanth had a larger role to play in TN’s development, while participating in a media event.

Towards the end of last year, both Kamal Hassan and Rajinikanth had said they would join hands, if need be, politically, for the betterment of Tamil Nadu. While Kamal launched his political party in early 2018, Rajinikanth, vowed on December 31, 2017, to take the political plunge in time for the assembly election in the state, which is scheduled to be held in the summer of 2021.

152,['11/01/2020'],Over 70.16 lakh trees felled in Maharashtra during last five years,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: Even as the Indian State of Forest Report (ISFR)-2019 has revealed that Maharashtra topped the chart by having maximum tree cover, information sought under RTI reveals that in the last five years, 5,74,276 trees have been felled illegally and 64,42,401 with permission from tree officers.

According to information received under RTI by activist Abhay Kolarkar, 70,16,677 trees were felled in the state from 2015-2019. Of this, 5,74,276 were felled illicitly, which include 1,73,941 teak trees. The value of the green cover loss has been estimated at Rs26.04 crore. This doesn’t include the huge environment loss.

The data on illicit felling is up to September 2019. If the remaining three months till December 2019 were to be considered, the loss could be even more.

Similarly, permission to fell over 64,42,401 trees towards 69,412 cases was granted by range forest officers (RFOs) to private parties. Of these, over 43,66,790 were teak trees.

Interestingly, the figures don’t include thousands of trees that have been felled for various developmental projects in recorded forest areas (RFAs).

“The large-scale felling, both illicit and legal, exposes the state forest department’s indifferent attitude towards destruction of precious green cover. The RFOs, who act as tree officers under Maharashtra Felling of Trees (Regulation) Act, 1964, have to ensure that two trees are planted for every tree felled. But, forest officials never ensure whether compensatory plantation has been done or not by private parties,” charged Kolarkar.

“There is no system of checking whether each individual is planting trees in lieu of felled trees. Forest department too doesn’t have any information in respect of compensatory plantation under the said Act,” adds Kolarkar.

This is a huge loss despite spending several crores on salaries of protection force of the department. Almost all divisions are having mobile squads, along with armed constables from police department, he says.

“Even arms have been provided in most of the sensitive divisions. During the period under consideration (2015-19), more than 200 vehicles have been provided to the department and now almost all territorial divisions have independent vehicle. Yet, illicit felling is rampant,” alleged Kolarkar.

The RTI activist says information on tree felling is just the tip of the iceberg. There may be many cases where action is not taken by the department staff and many incidents may have gone unnoticed.

The latest report by Forest Survey of India (FSI) has stated that tree cover in Maharashtra has increased by 915sqkm compared to last report released in 2017.

153,['11/01/2020'],CCTV surveillance helped bring down crime in city,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Vadodara: The end of 2019 has brought some good news for the city police. The data for the year revealed that the occurrence of serious crimes registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in the city had gone down significantly even as cheating offences registered a minor rise.

Details compiled by the city police regarding various offences registered in the city reveals that there was a fall of 6.25% in offences registered in the city. Against 3,009 offences registered in 2018, the number of offences registered in 2019 stood at 2,821 – lower by 188 offences.

What will come as a major relief to the city police is the fact that offences like housebreaks and robberies including chain snatching that had become a major headache in the past had gone down significantly. These coupled with burglaries were amongst major embarrassments for the city police in the past.

Apart from other offences, the number of cases of abduction that were largely of elopement, people being taken away to recover money and of children going missing had also come down. The incidents of attacks on government servants had also declined in 2019 as compared to the previous year.

A major reason for the fall is said to be CCTV surveillance that has increased significantly in the city. Sources said that another factor that deterred offenders was that several offences that took place during the year were detected promptly. The city police detected five dacoity cases, 37 robbery cases, 70 burglaries and 275 theft cases during the year. As many as 30 chain snatching cases were also detected.

Another reason for the reduction in crime is said to be the effective detention of habitual offenders under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA). In all, 179 persons ere detained under PASA and the figure was higher by 30% in 2019 as compared to 2018.

NASHIK: Hemant Godse, Member of Parliament from Nashik , on Friday said that the state government will soon give its consent for financing the Nashik-Pune railway double track project — the detailed project report for which has already been submitted.

Godse said that he has requested the state transport minister Anil Parab for expediting the process of construction of the railway track following which the latter has assured to look into the matter at the earliest.

“A detailed project report (DPR) is ready with the Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited and only the state government’s nod is required so that the central government can take up the steps to start the construction of the track on priority basis,” Godse said.

“I met the transport minister to draw his attention towards the fact that people from Nashik and Pune are eagerly waiting for sanctioning of the track,” he added.

The semi high-speed double track project is expected to cost around Rs 16,039 crore. The construction is expected to begin in the current year and will require 1,200 days for completion.

Nashik, Pune and Mumbai is a triangle and Nashik-Pune rail link will open up faster connectivity between Northern and Southern states of the country not only for the passengers, but also for movement of goods.

“While the state government had given in principle approval few years ago, the central government had approved Rs 200 crore for preparation of the DPR in the year 2017-18,” Godse said.

Of the total cost of Rs 16,039 crore for the construction of the track, the state government’s share is of 20%. A good chunk of money will also be raised through private financiers.

Nashik-Pune double track will bring faster connectivity between the two cities. Not only the travelling time between Nashik and Pune will be reduced to less than two hours, but at the same time the North South trains that currently take the route via Kalyan will have an alternate route to travel on.

KANPUR: Police have decided to attach moveable and immovable properties of as many as 28 suspects who have been absconding since the incidents of violence and arson occurred during anti-CAA stir on December 20 and 21 in Babupurwa and Yateemkhana areas of the city. Police have also announced a reward on rioters who are absconding.

“In Babupurwa area, out of 39 rioters, 17 have been identified as absconders, while in the Yateemkhana area of the 28, nearly 11 identified rioters are absconding,” said IG Mohit Agarwal and added that the absconders are adopting unethical ways to evade arrest.

“As per the procedure, the police will move an application under relevant sections of the CrPC before the court for proclaiming a suspect to be an absconder after which the court will issue a notice to the absconder. The notice has a window period of 30 days, giving a final chance to the suspect to either surrender to the police and cooperate in the ongoing investigation registered against him/her or challenge the said notice in the court. Under this process, the notice is given to the immediate kin of the suspect, and it is also pasted on the house,” said a senior police official.

After the lapse of the notice period, another application is moved under relevant sections of the CrPC before the court, seeking permission to attach the assets of the absconding suspect and it is usually granted within a day.

“Despite running out of all legal remedies, these 28 suspects wanted by the different police stations, continue to evade arrest, forcing us to deal the cases with an iron hand”, the IG said.

As part of the process, police will collect data of movable and immovable assets registered in the name of listed suspects from the regional transport office and registrar of properties, and will also declare reward on absconding identified rioters, he added.

157,['11/01/2020'],"Newborn screening to detect defects is a must, say experts","This story is from January 11, 2020

NAGPUR: Every newborn should be screened for defects like hearing loss, congenital hypothyroidism , congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and glucose-6 deficiency.

Defects like hearing loss can be detected at the earliest during newborn screening. This ensures timely cochlear implant and good quality of life to kids born with deafness.

Expert doctors in the field of ear, nose, throat as well as head and neck surgeries — termed as otolaryngologists are holding a national conference in Nagpur. They said that neonatal screening is integral part of childcare in many countries just like immunization.

“Early detection and early cochlear implant ensures best results and less struggle for kids to join the mainstream,” said Dr Satya Prakash Dubey, national president of Association of Otolaryngologists of India (AOI).

“Government can make it compulsory to screen all babies at least for hearing loss. In Indian conditions, it takes two to four years to detect hearing loss in kids. This delays cochlear implant. Subsequently, it delays auditory verbal therapy which is must for kids undergoing cochlear implant,” said Dr Dubey.

Prof Niel Tolley, pioneer of robotic head and neck surgery in the UK, said head and neck surgeries have become very accurate with effective use of artificial intervention technique.

“Robotics have added accuracy to the otherwise complicated head and neck surgeries. We can avoid risks to brain nerves and paralysis,” he said.

Prof Tolley, along with Nagpur’s Dr Madan Kapre, has performed several thyroid surgeries on children in Melghat and he is well-versed with Indian conditions.

Prof Gregory Randolph, from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said risks like loss of voice after thyroid operations have become negligible with the new technique.

Surgeons coming from all parts of the country were surprised to know that progressive state like Maharashtra is yet to start state programme to treat kids with hearing loss.

“As many as 12 states in the country run specific programmes through which funds are allotted to needy patients to undergo cochlear implant surgeries. These surgeries are still not covered under Ayushman Bharat. Assistance to Disabled Persons for Purchase Appliances (ADIP scheme) has its own limitations. As these surgeries are complicated and costly, government support is a must,” said Dr Sanjay Agrawal from Indore. He said Madhya Pradesh government has funded the cochlear implants under Bal Shravan Yojana and performed 4,000 free surgeries in last four years.

158,['11/01/2020'],Gujarat high court paves way to regularize co-operative land that was last bought by farmers,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Gujarat high court

AHMEDABAD: A division bench of the Gujarat high court on Thursday cleared the way for regularization of land parcels held by cooperatives that were last last bought by farmers. Most of these land parcels are reported to be held by builders in the name of farmers and co-operative societies. The division bench upheld an order junking the state government’s 2017 circular, by which it restrained regularization of such land, in the interest of farmers.

The case pertains to land parcels in Ognaj village on the outskirts of Ahmedabad city, that were bought by cooperative societies in 1990s. The cooperative societies, mainly formed by builders, could not regularize the sales as they were not farmers, and according to the state’s tenancy laws, agricultural land cannot be sold to non-agriculturalists without permission of the district collector. As the district collector repeatedly rejected their requests, the NA permission could not be obtained over the last two decades.

In 2015, the Anandiben Patel government amended the Gujarat Tenancy and Agriculture Act by inserting Section 63AB in the Act. With this amendment, an agricultural land parcel, even if sold to a non-agriculturist, like a company or a cooperative, can be regularized by charging a premium if the last purchaser of the land was a farmer. The last transaction should have been made before June 2015.

In 2017, the Vijay Rupani-led state government issued a circular annulling the provisions of this amendment in the Gujarat Tenancy and Agriculture Act, 2015.

With the circular, many farmers who purchased land from cooperative societies in Ognaj village, could not regularize their purchase. Due to this, they could not obtain NA permission. The district collector has been denying the NA permission to cooperative societies, and then also to such farmers.

Following the 2017 circular, over half a dozen farmers from Ognaj moved the HC challenging the 2017 circular. In 2018, the single judge held that agricultural land, which was held by a cooperative society before final sale to a farmer, can be regularized on payment of a fixed premium.

The HC also held that a cooperative-society can be termed a ‘person’ for the purpose of land holding. The single bench ordered the district collector to take fresh decisions on applications filed by the farmers for NA permissions.

The state government challenged the single judge order before the division bench. It insisted that the provisions have been made in the circular in the interest of farmers.

After hearing the arguments, the bench of Justice S R Brahmbhatt and Justice A P Thaker observed that the government cannot nullify its legislation by issuing a circular.

161,['11/01/2020'],Andhra Pradesh: Two-hour stay as YS Jaganmohan Reddy appears before CBI court as CM,"This story is from January 11, 2020

HYDERABAD: For the first time since he became chief minister of Andhra Pradesh on May 30 last year, YS Jaganmohan Reddy appeared before the special CBI court in Hyderabad on Friday in connection with the quid pro quo case filed by CBI against him.

Other accused, including YSRCP MP V Vijayasai Reddy, former revenue minister Dharmana Prasada Rao, along with IAS officers, industrialists and government officials of undivided AP also appeared before the court.

Jagan appeared before the court at 10.40 am and sat in the court hall for two hours. His earlier plea, seeking a joint hearing in the pleas of various accused in all the chargesheets seeking discharge from the case, was taken up for hearing.

Principal special judge of CBI courts BV Madhusudan Rao heard both his counsel and CBI counsel K Surender and reserved his orders to January 17. Heavy security was in place at the Gagan Vihar CBI court building when Jagan was present.

Jagan has been appearing before the court after the case was filed against him in 2013. It was only during 2018, that he sought a blanket exemption from court appearances to enable himself take up the huge mass contact programme ‘padayatra’ as the main opposition leader of AP. The court had rejected it and advised him to ask the trial court to dispense with his presence whenever it was needed.

Ever since he became the CM, his counsel has been filing the ‘dispense with’ pleas every week and accommodated by the court taking into consideration the busy schedule of the chief minister. Last week, the CBI court, however, directed Jagan and Vijayasai to appear before the court on January 10.

ED court to decide

Meanwhile, Jagan filed a separate plea before a special court trying the cases filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) urging it to allow a co-accused in the case to represent him as it is difficult for him to appear before the court for all the hearings. It can be recalled the principal special judge court of CBI is designated as special ED court. The same court is now hearing both the cases.

Jagan filed another petition before the ED court, urging it to defer the trial in the cases filed by ED till the trial in CBI cases is complete and till the CBI court pronounces its order on the guilt or innocence of the accused. ED counsel TV Subba Rao has been arguing against these two pleas saying that section 44 of PMLA envisages a joint trial for both CBI and ED cases. “The trial in ED cases need not wait for CBI cases to conclude,” he said. He also opposed the plea of one accused representing another in the court. Madhusudan Rao reserved his orders in the cases to January 24.

NASHIK: Former union finance minister Yashwant Sinha on Friday said his Shanti Yatra was against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and he will conclude it the day central government announces its withdrawal.

Sinha’s rally started from Mumbai on Thursday and will pass through five states, including Maharashtra, Gujarat , Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. On Friday, his rally will pass through Pune before coming to Sangamner, Nashik and then to Gujarat.

“The government is actually afraid of people and it never confronts them at any point. Even today there are rallies across the country opposing the CAA. The protests will stop the day government announces recalling of the black act,” Sinha said at Sangamner in Ahmednagar district.

Sinha reiterated that the government was tossing up the CAA and other issues to create a flutter among people and divert their attention away from the major issues like country’s dropping economic health.

Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan and MLA Ashish Deshmukh were also present at the rally.

Speaking to reporters, Chavan pointed out that BJP’s hidden agendas are now coming to the fore. “The party at the time of elections promised development, but has now switched over to its real agenda. There is a huge difference between party’s preaching and deeds,” Chavan said.

“The entire country is opposing the CAA and NRC, but home minister Amit Shah is bent on implementing the same. The government has failed to come clean on documents required to be sought from people to prove their citizenship. Without any information the government is setting up detention camps. We will fight till justice is done,” he added.

Representative image

NASHIK: The average wholesale onion price at Lasalgaon APMC, country’s largest wholesale onion market, on Friday dropped by 15% to Rs 3,000 per quintal against Rs 3,500 per quintal on Thursday.

The average wholesale onion price has dropped by almost Rs 1,200 or 30% in the past five days — from Rs 4,200 per quintal on Tuesday to Rs 3,000 per quintal — owing to rise in supply.

In the retail market of the city, onions are being sold in the price range between Rs 40-50 per kg. The result of drop in wholesale price is expected to reflect in retail markets in the next two three days and retail onion price is expected to drop in the range of Rs 30-40 per kg.

Earlier, the average wholesale onion price recorded an all-time high of Rs 8,625 per quintal at Lasalgaon on December 16. But in the next 15 days it dropped to Rs 4,500 per quintal.

The price crashed further by Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,500 per quintal on January 1, only to go up to Rs 4,351 per quintal the next day.

“Markets are witnessing rise in supply of fresh produce. Hence, the price trend in wholesale markets will be downward. The average wholesale onion price is expected to drop to Rs 2,200 per quintal by next week,” the APMC official said.

The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon on Friday were recorded at Rs 1,200 and Rs 3,500 per quintal, respectively.

“Usually, the arrival of fresh kharif onions begin by mid-October, but unseasonal rainfall badly affected the kharif onion crop across Maharashtra. Around 75% of the onion plantation was damaged due to rains. This created scarcity of onions that increased the average wholesale onion price,” the official said.

“However, at around 45,000 hectare, the acreage of late kharif onions has increased at large in the district. Now, the harvest of late kharif onions is increasing gradually and the supply will increase further from the second half of this month,” he added.

164,['11/01/2020'],Fine Arts Fair set for comeback after 9 years,"This story is from January 11, 2020

The fair is a legacy started in 1961

Vadodara: The Fine Arts Fair is back after a gap of nine years.

M S University’s famed Faculty of Fine Arts is all set to unveil the two-day fair from Saturday.

The fair is a legacy that started in 1961 by late professor Shankho Chowdhary and professor K G Subhramanyan. Since then it was held after a gap of every two or three years. The last fine arts fair was held in 2011.

“It is an eagerly awaited event that will revive memories of all those who have witnessed a Fine Arts Fair before – starting from students, faculty, alumni and citizens of Baroda. The fair is an ideal platform to bring everyone together for sharing the fun of creating for a cause!” said N G Bagodi, dean of Faculty of Fine Arts.

Appropriate with the theme of the fair – ‘Marine’ – a mega-sized octopus will be welcoming the guests at the entrance gate of the faculty.

Nearly 300 past and present students apart from staff are working day and night since last one and a half year to make this fair a success.

“The fair supports amazing themes every time. It is about mobile installations, live puppet shows, theatre, films, creative crafts, affordable arts, children’s books, innovative gate decoration, hand-crafted toys, enamel arts, ceramic crafts, textile, handmade jewellery in metal, ceramics, calendars, portfolios, sculptures and much more,” he said.

The fair is significant as funds generated from it have been donated in the past to the victims of earthquakes, tsunamis, riot victims, jawans in border areas, survivors of natural calamities and the needy students who require financial aid.

“The fair is also special because it upholds the Sanskar Nagari designation of Baroda – the citizens get a chance to be a part of a unique creative event,” he said.

166,['11/01/2020'],Candidate for judge locks horns with Gujarat high court over right answer to legal question,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: A candidate aspiring to be a civil judge has locked horns with the Gujarat high court over interpretation of a law. A fresh LLB, Diksha Trivedi (24), dragged the HC recruitment section to court, disputing the latter’s answer key on the issue of the validity of a cheque.

Trivedi approached the high court’s judicial side after her answer to a question, which was asked in an elimination test for civil judges, was declared wrong and she fell 0.23 marks short of a score of 50 to qualify for the next stage. The written examination is scheduled on January 19 and Trivedi challenged the examiner’s interpretation of the law and demanded that she be allowed to participate in the next level of the recruitment process.

The disputed answer concerned a question on Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, for the provisions of a cheque bounce. The question was about the time limit within which a cheque has to be presented to the bank. Trivedi opted for option ‘C’, whereas the HC’s answer key said option ‘A’ was correct.

Trivedi said the cheque has to be presented to the bank “within a period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier”. For the examiners, this period is three months.

Trivedi not only lost one mark after her answer on was marked incorrect, but also incurred .33% negative marks. She secured 49.63 marks. If this one answer is proved correct, she would pass for the written test. She recorded her objections to the answer key with regard to this question. When there was no reply on her objection, she filed a petition.

In her petition, Trivedi cited a 2011 Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular conveying to banks that the validity period for a cheque is three months. The student claimed that this was the RBI’s instruction for banking purposes, but so far as the law is concerned, the RBI’s instructions and present practice have nothing to do with the interpretation of the law, and the correct interpretation for the validity of a cheque is six months.

After a preliminary hearing, the high court on Wednesday permitted Trivedi to take the written test. There were 19 others who benefited from Trivedi’s fight, as they had also recorded their objection to the correct answer to this question. They too got permission to take the test. However, the HC said that the outcome of Trivedi’s litigation would decide the job status of these 20 candidates.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: The CBI court here summoned Telangana’s first woman minister Sabitha Indra Reddy , former revenue minister of AP Dharmana Prasada Rao and five others to appear before it on January 17 in connection with the quid pro quo case.

Principal special judge BV Madhusudan Rao passed this order on Friday while taking into cognisance a supplementary chargesheet filed by CBI in the quid pro quo case against AP chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy and others. The chargesheet revolved around irregularities committed allegedly for the purpose of helping Penna Cements, which is believed to have made huge investments in Jagan’s firms when his late father YSR was CM of undivided AP. The judge also dismissed the objections raised by Penna group over adding some more names in the list of accused in the supplementary chargesheet.

In the first chargesheet, CBI had named nine — Jagan, YSRC MP V Vijayasai Reddy, Penna Cements chairman Putta Pratap Reddy and six others — as accused. In the supplementary chargesheet, seven more persons — Sabitha, Dharmana and bureaucrats Y Srilakshmi, M Samuel and VD Rajagopal, tahsildar M Yellamma and DRO M Sudarshan Reddy — were named as accused.

CBI said Sabitha, as mines minister between 2004-09, and Rajagopal, as director of mines, went out of their way to grant mining leases to Penna Cements and arrayed them as accused in its chargesheet. Senior counsel E Uma Maheswara Rao, appearing for Penna Cements, urged the court to reject the supplementary chargesheet since it did not furnish any fresh material. The court, however, rejected the plea and summoned all of them.

CBI’s charge against Pratap was that his Penna group was showered with undue largesse by the YSR government by way of granting limestone mining leases, land allotments and concessions for a five-star hotel. In return, Pratap made Rs 68 crore investments in Jagan’s firms. CBI described this as a bribe for the benefits Penna group had extracted from the government.

The jewellery was kept in the house in view of Janakiraman’s niece’s marriage on January 20. The family had visited Chennai for shopping since his son and daughter-in-law had arrived from the US for the marriage.

The incident took place when they were away. On their return, they noticed that the house door was broke open and valuables were missing. Police estimated that at least 400 sovereigns of gold, valued at approximately Rs 1 crore , were stolen from five bureaus in the house along with at least Rs 50,000. Police, after initial inquiry, said the family took the gold ornaments from a bank locker on Thursday and kept them in the house.

Though more than 10 people worked in the house, none were there at the time of the incident. There were no CCTV cameras either at the house, police said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73201077,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-206665,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rs-1cr-worth-gold-stolen-from-bjp-mans-house/articleshow/73196155.cms

NASHIK: The Maha Vikas Aghadi ( MVA ) has added another feather in its cap as two of its candidates have won the the byelection in the two wards of the municipal corporation, the results of which were declared on Friday— which were previously the bastions of the BJP .

NCP’s Jagdish Pawar received 4,913 votes and defeated BJP’s Vishakha Shirsat, who secured 1,525 votes, to win the byelection in ward 22 (A) in Nashik division. The seat in this ward was lying vacant after BJP corporator Saroj Ahire resigned ahead of the state assembly elections . Ahire had left the saffron party and joined the NCP to contest from Deolali state assembly constituency.

Corporator Madhukar Jadhav from Shiv Sena won the byelection in ward 26 (A) in Satpur division. Jadhav defeated his rival, Dilip Datir from the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) , by a margin of 2,809 votes. While Jadhav received 5,865 votes, Datir secured 3,053 votes in the byelection.

The seat in ward no 26 (A) was lying vacant after Datir resigned as corporator from the Shiv Sena and joined the MNS to contest state assembly election from Nashik West constituency. After facing defeat in the state assembly elections, Datir again bit the dust in the ward byelection.

There are total 122 corporators in the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC). Currently, one seat in ward 4 (A) is lying vacant following the demise of a BJP corporator. Hence, presently, the total strength of the civic administration is 121.

Despite having lost the byelections in the two wards—the polls for which were conducted on Thursday, BJP is still in the power in the civic administration with 64 seats.

The Maha Vikas Aghadi was an alliance stitched by the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena to come to form the government at the state. The alliance formed by the three parties at the state seems to have trickled down to the civic bodies, as is evident from the MVA’s back-to-back victories in the ZP polls and ward byelections. The recent victories in the ward byelections has only lifted the spirits of the local MVA leaders who attribute the triumph to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray.

By winning the two seats, the MVA’s strength in the NMC has swelled to 48. Of this, 35 belong to Shiv Sena, 7 to NCP and 6 to Congress. While the MNS has 5 seats, there are four independents in the state.

“BJP has lost the byelections in both the civic wards. Our victories were a result of Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray taking over as the chief minister. People have shown their confidence in Thackeray and this is a clear sign of victory,” said Ajay Boraste, leader of the opposition from the Sena in the NMC.

“The MVA’s victory was because of the money power and also because the Aghadi is in power in the state. They misused power to win both the seats,” said Jagdish Patil, BJP’s group leader in the NMC.

176,['11/01/2020'],Vehicles sans FASTags spend more on tolls,"This story is from January 11, 2020

COIMBATORE: Now that the FASTags have been made compulsory, motorists who are yet to comply with the rule are at the receiving end as they are not allowed to buy two-way tickets and enjoy the nearly 30% discount as earlier.

The rush at the cash lanes in toll plazas such as Kaniyur toll plaza in the district have, meanwhile, come down considerably and the motorists needn’t have to wait long for their turn.

The central government had earlier passed a rule making FASTags compulsory by January 15 for all cars to cross toll plazas and doubling the toll amount for the vehicles that fail to comply with the fiat.

While all toll plazas have been instructed to make required changes, motorists have been given a 30-day extension to fix FASTags.

In Kaniyur toll plazas, the number of cash lanes was reduced to two from six, while increasing the number of FASTag lanes to six from the earlier two from January 15. “Our cash lanes continue to witness queues, while the FASTag lanes are moving seamlessly with cars hardly having to slow down for 30 to 45 seconds and just two cars standing in queue at a time,” said Murali, toll plaza manager.

If motorists without FASTags were to enter the lanes meant for FASTags, they would be charged double the toll fee as penalty. They also won’t be allowed to buy two-way toll tickets. “Motorists buying a two-way ticket save at least 27% to 30% compared to buying two one-way tickets. For example, cars which need to pay Rs 55 for a one-way ticket need to pay only Rs 80 for a two-way ticket. But we don’t offer two-way tickets at cash lanes anymore,” Murali said.

Pointing out that the toll plaza on an average sees around 30,000 cars daily, he said around 45% of them was using FASTags. “For vehicles that want to fix FASTags at our place, we have bankers setting up counters at the toll plaza office, where motorists can submit their photo and id proof and fix the same at a fee of Rs 250, and then recharge it online,” Murali said.

177,['11/01/2020'],Reduce black spots in Nashik to prevent accidents: Civic chief Radhakrishna Game,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Datta Mandir Chowk has been identified as black spot

NASHIK: Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game has directed the civic officials to take measures for reducing black spots in the city.

Game’s instructions came during a meeting of traffic mobility cell of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) held on Thursday.

During the meeting, NGO Nashik First submitted a list of over 17 black spots to the municipal commissioner, demanding immediate measures to prevent accidents.

Game instructed the officials concerned to take necessary measures such as installing speed breakers to control the speed of the vehicles and thus prevent accidents on these black spots as identified by the NGO.

Civic officials said that they will examine the list of black spots furnished by the NGO and take necessary measures.

“We have already identified some black spots with the help of the traffic police department. But, the NGO has also furnished a list of some black spots in the city where mishap often occurs. We will take their list into consideration,” said an NMC official.

“Recently, we conducted a survey in the city to find out black spots where frequent accidents occur. We have identified black spots at around 17 locations across six divisions of the municipal corporation,” said Abhay Kulkarni, chairman of Nashik First.

“During the meeting, we highlighted the need for preventive measures at black spots in the city and sought immediate measures from civic officials,” said Kulkarni.

Some of the black spots identified by the NGO include Datta Mandir square in Nashik Road, Carbon Naka in Satpur, Tarwala Nagar in Panchavati, near Ashoka Hospital in Vadalagaon, Tapovan Corner and the stretch near Hotel Green View on Trimbak Road.

A discussion on strengthening of the public transport system in the city also took place during the meeting. The NMC is going to take over the city bus service from the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC).

NMC has six divisions — Panchavati, New Nashik, Satpur, Nashik Road, Nashik East and Nashik West.

Mayor to start ‘visit to ward’ project from today

To understand the grievances of citizens, mayor Satish Kulkarni has announced to start ‘visit to ward’ project on every Saturday starting January 10.

Kulkarni will begin his visit from ward no. 31. He will visit each ward and interact with the residents to understand their grievances better.

The mayor said that the issues of the residents including water supply, garbage collections through garbage vans, roads, drainage, gardens and others would be sorted during the visit.

178,['11/01/2020'],Echo of tradition in the new generation,"The unadorned start was compensated by the momentousness of the programme, on Day 9, Thursday, of Saptak.

AHMEDABAD: Pandit Umakant Gundecha began an exposition of Rageshree with a one-word preface: “Ijazat…” (with your permission). The unadorned start was compensated by the momentousness of the programme, on Day 9, Thursday, of Saptak. The Dhrupad maestro was being accompanied for the first time by Anant, the son of Pandit Ramakant Gundecha.The familiar line-up of the Gundecha brothers — Pandits Ramakant and Umakant — had changed because of Pandit Ramakant’s demise last November. “I was happy performing with Anant,” Pandit Umakant Gundecha told TOI. “We live in a joint family and since his childhood, Anant has been immersed in my jugalbandi with his father. You could say Dhrupad inheres in Anant’s blood. When I sang with Anant, I felt Ramakant was with me on the stage.”Rageshree can burst onto listeners like good news. A popular interpretation of the raga is found in ‘Shubh din aayo’ (from “Mughal-e-Azam”) rendered by Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. In that song, the raga lends the throb of urgency to the bustle of the palace, the dancing courtiers, and the sweep of finery. But on Thursday, Rageshree was delivered with an elegiac alaap. The mood brightened later, with Anant Gundecha’s self-assured performance shooting out rays of a distinguished legacy. “It is impossible to fill my father’s shoes,” Anant Gundecha told TOI. “I try to do justice to the knowledge given by him and my uncle.”Indeed, Saptak demonstrates the flow tradition. The first baithak on Day 8, Wednesday, had brought sarodiya Amaan Ali Bangash to the stage. His father, the sarod god Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, himself gave TOI an insight into the programme. “Amaan played Lalita Gauree,” Khan-sahab told TOI. “That was followed by Nand Kauns. Parveen Sultana’s guru Pandit Chinmay Lahiri and I were the only two musicians who performed Nand Kauns all over the country.”Vocalist Monica Shah took the stage in the first baithak. The second featured the flute recital of Rakesh Chaurasia.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73202155,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-720635,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/echo-of-tradition-in-the-new-generation/articleshow/73196192.cms

NASHIK: “Rare Fair-2020,” a three-day exhibition of rare coins , bank notes and stamps kicked off in the city on Friday. It is being organised by Collector’s Society of Numismatic & Rare Items, Nashik .

Over 75 coin collectors from various parts of the country are participating in the exhibition. The collection includes various rare and unique items collected by the participants over the years.

Commissioner of police Vishwas Nangre-Patil formally inaugurated the event and appreciated the efforts of the organisation. He also honoured the exceptional work of the organisation in the field of Numismatics.

Ramavtar Jain, a stamp collector from Ahmedabad, who will showcase his rarest collection — the first stamp ticket from 1852 worth Rs 1.5 lakh — said, “People spend so much of money in watching movies and it’s like a hobby for them. But, my interests are different. I like to collect rare and unique stamps. I do not have a count of the number of stamps I have.”

Among the note collectors, one participant displayed his collection of misprinted notes.

Nitin Jain from Balod, Chhattisgarh, said “I got some misprinted notes from my friends and then I started looking for more of them. I, now, have a catalogue of real misprinted notes. It has become a hobby for me, but nothing comes for free.”

One of the collectors also had some unique silver items. Suraj Pasari from Vadodara has displayed an 80-year old lipstick holder which he had bought from a friend.

“It is made up of 68 gm pure silver. It is a unique item which no makes any more. The British must have got it made from a goldsmith,” shared Pasari.

The last fair was organised in 2018 which had attracted over 50,000 people over a period of three days. This year too, the organisers are looking forward to a good response from people.

“People like to display their rare collection during such events. The members of our organisation also evaluate the coins of the public on the basis of condition, name and variety, and tell them the price of them which they can sell off to the collectors,” vice president of the organisation Rajesh Junnare said.

As part of the event, an auction of rare coins is scheduled on Saturday at Indraprasth Hall, Gangapur Road.

182,['11/01/2020'],Aligarh MP accuses AMU of allowing “anti-national” activities on campus,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Agra: Aligarh MP Satish Gautam of BJP on Friday wrote a letter to vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor of AMU , castigating the way varsity authorities had been handling the allegation of “objectionable and indecent” activities on campus.

The MP’s letter comes a day after AMU students allegedly shouted inappropriate slogans against PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath, while forming a human chain inside the campus in solidarity with JNU students and teachers, who were attacked by masked men earlier this week. Around 25-30 students were later booked by police for this.

In his letter, the MP said he expects the VC to take strict action against the “handful of anti-social elements” that are vitiating the peaceful atmosphere on campus and ruining the academic session of scores of students.

He said it is unfortunate that the university feels pride in welcoming people who are “anti-government, anti-national and anti-Constitutional”. The administration watches mutely as such people come and speak against the government and the nation inside the campus. He said such activities inside AMU send the wrong message across the world that an educational institution has turned into a hub of anti-national activities.

The letter stated while it is the university’s moral responsibility to smoothly carry out educational activities, students should focus on their studies, that the situation on campus is reversed and efforts are made by the administration, teachers and students to end the poison.

Attacking university registrar Abdul Hamid, the MP said a senior IPS officer was appointed for the university’s welfare, not for watching anti-social activities being carried out on campus.

AMU students have been protesting against CAA, NRC and NPR on campus for the last month. Even members of the faculty have joined their candlelight vigils on campus every evening for the last 10 days.

AGRA: The mega facility for processing of biodegradable waste into compost at Kuberpur landfill site will start operating on Saturday. The plant developed with an investment of Rs 11.27 crore has the capacity to convert 300 metric tonnes per day (TPD) of waste into compost.According to an official estimate, 100 municipal wards of the city produce around 1,000 metric tonnes of solid waste every day. Out of this, 650 metric tonnes comprises non-biodegradable waste while 350 metric tonnes biodegradable waste.Talking with TOI, municipal commissioner Arun Prakash said, “The modern plant for processing of biodegradable waste into compost will start operations on Saturday. In five sheds, a total 300 TPD compost will be produced. Agra Municipal Corporation workers are separately collecting biodegradable waste from different parts of the city. Now, we will be able to utilize almost all the green waste produced in the city.”At present, AMC is operating five small waste-to-compost plants in different parts of the city. On a daily basis, 35 metric tonnes of compost is being produced at these centres.Meanwhile, working on its “zero-waste city” plan under Swachh Bharat Mission, AMC has delivered 880 tonnes of compost to Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Limited (IFFCO), which was prepared by processing biodegradable waste collected from different parts of the city. In addition, it is providing compost to farmers free of cost to encourage organic farming.In October 2017, a power purchase agreement (PPA) was signed in Lucknow between Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) and Spark Bresson Private Limited, a Czech company, contracted by the AMC, to set up and operate the waste-to-energy facility. Under the agreement, UPPCL agreed to purchase electricity produced at the waste-to-energy plant in Agra.According to the AMC officials, the work to set up the waste-to-energy facility is likely to start by the end of this year after securing permission of the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) authorities and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

184,['11/01/2020'],"‘To others Yesudas is legend, to me he’s guruji’","This story is from January 11, 2020

Chennai: The world has been singing praises about the voice of Kattassery Joseph (KJ) Yesudas , who turned 80 on Friday, for close to six decades, but very few know it was a taunt, from a guru, that set him on the path.

“I don’t know why he [the guru] used to call me ‘mappila,’ the way some people address Muslims in Kerala,” Yesudas had told TOI in 2012. “He always told me I couldn’t sing, but when he repeated, ‘Mappila, you can’t sing for nuts’, before I took the stage at Radha Lakshmy Nilayam music school in Tripunithura, Kerala, it shattered me.”

It goaded him into a strict regimen of learning that has made him what he is today— a singer seeking humanism in music, a philosopher who finds music in human relations, and somewhere in between a philanthropist who helps provide free heart surgeries for poor in Kerala and elsewhere.

And he remains ‘ guruji ’ for Gangai Amaran , for taking him to Sabarimala first in the 1970s. The musician-lyricist-director, youngest of the Pavalar brothers including Ilaiyaraja, says it’s just not music that has connected them. “To Yesudas, I was special. Any day, I can gate-crash into his house and have a meal. Whenever I say, ‘Yeniki Malayalam Samasaram Ella’, he would say, ‘Dai Amar, it is Yeniki Malayalam Samsarikaan Arinjunda’.”

On another occasion, they were recording ‘Manitha Manitha Ini Un Vizhigal’ from ‘Kan Sivanthaal Man Sivakkum’ when Gangai Amaran was asked to leave the studio because he found something amiss with the rendition. “Later, he realised I was right, and we patched up.”

Several musicians and singers from Tamil Nadu and Kerala, who greeted Yesudas through videos and tweets, say any conversation with him begins and ends with music, devotion, discipline and god.

Krishnachandran, with 1,000 songs in Malayalam and Tamil, says he faces ‘starting trouble’ when asked to speak about his association with the legend . “I was born in 1960 and he started his career in 1961. I grew up breathing and listening to his songs. In Kerala, Yesudas is be all and end all for us. Days begin with his soulful music and the nights end in a similar fashion.”

After making his debut as an actor, Krishnachandran got the chance to sing with S Janaki and Yesudas in Malayalam film ‘Ina’. “I was teased by Das Ettan for debuting in a movie alongside Jayabharathi. But, slowly he realised my singing prowess and after the ‘Ina’ song recording, he complimented me which made me feel I received a national award of sorts.”

Yesudas, Krishnachandran says, never encourages small talk. “Even if a conversation starts on a lighter vein, Yesudas makes sure the discussion is always about music.”

AGRA: After cancelling the contract with private companies, Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) has started collecting garbage door to door on its own across all the 100 wards of the city. However, some of the localities are yet to be covered. To increase efficiency, the civic body administration has decided to deploy three twin-dustbin autos in each ward.The civic body presently has 100 twin-dustbin autos. These have separate sections for biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. AMC has initiated the process of purchasing 200 more such autos. Besides, the civic body administration is going to rope in NGOs to strengthen the door-to-door collection plan.Municipal commissioner Arun Prakash said, “We have prepared an action plan for waste management. Soon, three twin-dustbin autos will be deployed in each of the 100 wards of the city. Separate route maps have been prepared for these vehicles to operate. Each vehicle will collect garbage from 1,000 houses in one ward. By this, we will be able to collect garbage from three lakh houses, ensuring a litter-free city.”Prakash added that NGOs will be roped in to aid in collecting garbage. Each volunteer (NGO) ensuring garbage collection from 1,000 houses in the assigned area will be paid at the rate of Rs 15 per house at the end of each month. Besides, improving maintenance of sanitation and hygiene in the city, this will generate employment for at least 100 people with a salary of Rs 15,000, he added.The civic body administration is working on a plan to charge for door-to-door garbage collection and add it in house tax bills of residents who refuse to pay directly to the workers. For this, the house tax collection software will be updated.On Friday, the municipal commissioner conducted inspection in half-a-dozen localities of the city to check status of door-to-door garbage collection. He directed supervisors to ensure standard cleanliness work in the city ahead of the central government's cleanliness survey -- Swachh Survekshan 2020.Meanwhile, AMC has started installing advanced global positioning system (GPS) devices in all garbage collection vehicles for real time monitoring of their movement. The move is aimed at ensuring that garbage collected from different parts of the city reaches the landfill site in a time bound manner. It will also enable the authorities to keep a tab on fuel consumption.",agra,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73200286,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-485655,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/amc-takes-up-garbage-collection-from-door-to-door-in-city/articleshow/73195268.cms
186,['11/01/2020'],Residents oppose city corpn’s plan to construct micro composting centre,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Coimbatore: Residents of GV Residency and cadre of DMK on Friday staged a protest opposing the city corporation’s move to set up a micro composting centre (MCC) on the land earmarked for a scheme road in their area.

“A couple of decades ago, the city corporation proposed a scheme road to connect Avinashi Road and Trichy Road, passing along the border of the layout in parallel to a water channel. But, when World Classical Tamil Conference took place in the city in 2010, the road was laid through the layout but not as per the proposed design,” president of GV Residency Welfare Association N Narasiman said.

“When we questioned the corporation, they assured us in writing that it was laid temporarily, and it would be re-laid as per the proposal,” he said, adding that the civic body had not taken any steps to correct it till date.

Explaining that 40,000 square feet of open space reservation (OSR) site is located adjacent to the scheme road, he said the corporation has commenced constructing the centre at the OSR site and the land earmarked for scheme road, thus blocking the road.

President of Tanthai Periyar Nagar Welfare Association S Paramasivam said by constructing the centre amid the residential area, the civic body was putting the health of the public at stake.

“When we visited the centre at Kavundampalayam, we couldn’t tolerate the foul smell emanating from it. Not just us, even the workers at the centre are struggling to cope up with the strong smell. Also, the centre is filled with flies belying corporation’s claims,” he added.

“At Kavundampalayam, the centre is located at least a kilometre away from the residential area. But here, the centre is constructed within the residential area. Already, we are bearing the foul smell emanating from the water channel filled with sewage. If the centre is also established, it would become unbearable,” another resident of GV Residency, S Karthik, said.

Denying the allegations, the corporation officials said that the land was earmarked for OSR site and not for road. As we could be using the centre to turn wet waste into manure, foul smell would not emanate from the centre, the official added.

Agra: Next time you see or hear any advertisement of ‘work from home’ - an online job, fetching handsome monthly remuneration - be cautious as it may be a trick to lure gullible job aspirants, says Agra cyber cell after they busted a gang involved in duping several job aspirants.

According to police, a group of men hailing from Hathras, Aligarh and Mathura had floated a fake online company of data feeding, and charged job aspirants with minimum registration fee of Rs 7,000 in the name of job offers.

Sub inspector Amit Kumar, the member of Agra cyber cell investigating team, said on Friday, “The matter came to our light after a Dayalbagh-based woman identified as Tulika Gupta filed a complaint of being cheated for Rs 10,800 by the gang in the name of offering a job.

“We arrested three men, including Yogesh Kumar, a graduate hailing from Hathras, Rohitash alias Bhola, another resident of Hathras who is professional wrestler, and intermediate pass Harish Kumar of Aligarh,” said investigating officer.

He added that the kingpin of the gang identified as Sachin of Mathura is absconding, but we managed to retrieve data of over 100 men and women of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and other states from whom the gang managed to extort up to Rs 8 lakh in the past six months.

189,['11/01/2020'],Indian rail official’s ‘wall of kindness’ spreads warmth this winter,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Agra: In a world where some global leaders endeavour to build “walls of hatred”, a 32-year-old Indian railway official has tried to turn walls of some railway stations in western Uttar Pradesh into “walls of kindness”. Here, train passengers have been voluntarily hanging their warm clothes for the needy.

With this unique initiative, even as the state’s temperature dips to bone chilling cold, Sanjay Kumar of north central railway zone has spread warmth among the underprivileged and homeless living near the stations of Dadri, Aligarh, Firozabad and Etawah, among others. The noble initiative was introduced more than a week ago by the assistant traffic manager, Tundla.

Kumar’s cause drew much inspiration from Iran’s ‘dewar-e-meherbani’, a charity work which gained momentum in the winter of 2015, after the country’s economy was hit hard with multiple sanctions imposed by the United States and some European nations leading to increase in number of unemployed and homeless people. Some of these Iranians who could not afford enough clothes, found relief from the ones placed on various walls by local volunteers. Of course, Kumar’s cause of building “wall of kindness” comes at a time when leaders like Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are working on building “walls of hatred” along their nation’s respective borders with Mexico and West Bank.

“With the help of colleagues, friends and other railway staff members, we have started hanging warm clothes - both old and new - on the walls of our railway stations for destitute and the underprivileged. The response has been positive so far with children, women and the elderly often walking up to these walls and taking clothes from there as per their requirement,” said Kumar, who is a 2016-batch Indian railway traffic service officer.

“Soon, we also saw train passengers donating their clothes for these walls. We intend to spread this initiative to more possible locations where privileged people can come forward and contribute to those in need - who can come by and pick up clothes to survive the severe winter months,” Kumar added.

Posted four months ago in Allahabad division, Kumar along with his senior divisional security commissioner Manoj Kumar Singh, was also credited for helping nearly 6,000 AMU students for a hassle-free and safe boarding of trains after police and university administrations asked the students to vacate hostels and leave for their homes, immediately, post anti-CAA clashes between police and students.

Representative image

TIRUPUR: The city police will soon launch a dedicated beat system by improving public participation.

Under the system, the city has been divided into 22 geographical areas called beats, police commissioner Sanjay Kumar told reporters. “There are 10 police stations including two all women police stations in the city. For each beat, WhatsApp groups that have 200 members either living or working in the respective beats have been formed. Each beat will have a dedicated police constable, who will frequently get in touch with the members of the groups as well as meet them in person,” the officer said.

“As many as 88 police constables have been deployed to conduct round-the-clock patrol. The personnel will interact with people and address law and order issues based on information they receive. We hope the drive will help our personnel gain confidence and bring public closer to us. We want to create a forum for open dialogue,” Kumar said.

Preparatory work for the dedicated beat system was launched two months ago, said deputy commissioner of police V Badrinarayanan. “Thanks to the system, as many as 4,400 people are in constant touch with us. It has helped us to improve policing. We could prevent a house break-in in Thirumuruganpoondi recently,” he said.

“Of the 22 beats, we have so far provided mobile tracking devices (MTD) in 10 beats. If an emergency call reaches toll-free number 100, the police personnel present near the crime scene would be assigned to attend the emergency. MTD, a GPS-enabled device, helps to increase accuracy and reduce the time in reaching the spot. We plan to have the device in all beats soon,” Badrinarayanan said.

As data collected from the field is entered in computers, even if a constable is transferred or promoted, the duties will be carried out seamlessly, said constable Sanjay.

The AMU students were booked on Thursday evening after they raised derogatory slogans against Modi and Yogi while participating in the formation of a human chain to express solidarity with JNU students and teachers, who were attacked by a mob in their campus in New Delhi.

Talking to media, Singh warned the students against opposing CAA and NRC and advised them to mend their ways. “Students will not be able get bails if they are booked under sedition charges,” he said, adding that the students were taking undue advantage of the situation by defaming the leaders.

COIMBATORE: Three stray dogs were poisoned to death by unidentified miscreants at Ramanathapuram in the city on Friday.

A resident of Ramanathapuram lodged a complaint with the police after her attempt to save the dogs failed.

“Early this morning when we stepped out of our house, we noticed that one of the stray dogs was behaving abnormally. Shortly, we noticed that blood was gushing out from its mouth. As we were hurrying to take the dog to veterinary hospital, it died,” the complainant, J Indhumathi, said.

“In a few minutes, we noticed another dog dying in a similar way at a ground near our house at Vigneshpuram. One of our neighbors also shared a similar story with us,” she said. Doctors had confirmed that the dogs were poisoned to death, she said.

About a year ago, 10 stray days were poisoned to death in the same area.

Incidents of dogs being poisoned to death are often reported in the city. One of the reasons cited is that there is an increase in population of stray dogs, which some see as a menace.

“The corporation should be blamed for poisoning of dogs. The civic body has failed to act upon complaints regarding dog menace. Walk into any street and you will see a pack of dogs. The number of dogs has visibly increased in the recent times. They often chase people and bite them. People are just scared to walk on the streets,” G Aravind, a resident of RS Puram, said.

It has been two and half years since the corporation stopped implementing the animal birth control (ABC) programme in 80 wards after closing the dog shelter at Ukkadam in 2017. A corporation official said a dog shelter at Ondipudur is under construction. Once the shelter is commissioned, birth control programme would be restarted,” he told TOI.

CHENNAI: Expressing its dismay over the rampant misuse of ‘ Press ’ stickers and ‘media accreditation’ cards issued by the state government by persons with criminal backgrounds, the Madras high court has observed that some minimum criteria must be brought in for registering news magazines and papers.

“All the black sheep should be weeded out. A person who prints two papers claims to be a reporter or a media person. Due to such people, mainstream journalists are being sidelined. Even genuine reporters do not get accreditation card provided by the state government,” said a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice P Velmurugan on Friday.

The bench made the observations while hearing a plea moved by Sekaran, who claimed to be a journalist. He alleged that retired IPS officer Pon Manickavel had made false claims in his report filed to the court in his capacity as a special officer of the idol wing CID.

Questioning his credentials as journalist, the bench directed the state to file a report as to the number of recognised news magazines and papers in the state along with the number of employees in each such organisation and details of accreditation cards provided. The court further directed the government to inform as to the availability of any scheme providing financial assistance to journalists in the event of their death. The state was directed to file the report by January 21.

“Like ‘ advocate ’ stickers, ‘press’ stickers are also misused by many with criminal background claiming to be a reporter. The court wants the state to file a status report as to the number of cases filed against fake journalists for blackmailing and exploiting businessmen,” the bench added.

Agra: While refusing to interfere with the Allahabad high court order banning protests and rallies either at the main gate of the administrative block of the Aligarh Muslim University ( AMU ) or within a 100-meter radius of the block and the vice chancellor’s official residence within the campus, the Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the petitioner to challenge the High court order.

Appearing for the petitioner, Huzaifa Aamir Rashadi, who is former students’ union secretary, senior advocate Indira Jaising assisted by advocate Paras Nath Singh, submitted an application before the apex court stating that the high court’s order was passed behind the backs of students.

A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and KM Joseph proceeded to grant liberty to the petitioner to approach the concerned High Court, if the decision was indeed passed behind the backs of the students.

“The Allahabad high court on May 17, 2019 on the petition filed by the AMU administration, had banned dharnas at AMU’s administrative block main gate or within its 100-meter radius. However, the Aligarh district administration had told the high court that the protest was staged in a very peaceful manner and there was no question of deterioration of law and order in the university,” said advocate Paras.

The high court had further directed the university to earmark an area where the students could congregate freely in a peaceful manner to protest.

Coimbatore: The food safety department plans to launch the repurpose used cooking oil (Ruco) project in the district next month to turn used edible oil from the food industry into biodiesel.

With the city corporation refusing to collect used oil and no other disposal method available, restaurants, bakeries and sweet makers here have been selling the oil to smaller food business operators and soap manufacturing units. Some pour it down the drains, leading to clogs.

Officials of the department, who recently attended a meeting conducted by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India in New Delhi, had met some people who run units that process cooking oil and convert it into biodiesel the closest one being in Hyderabad.

According to a survey conducted by the department, 150-200 large-scale food business operators in the district generate 30,000 litres of used oil a day. The department plans to make them collect the oil daily and hand it over to an agent. “We are trying to identify an agent, who can collect the used oil from hotels and store it in a godown and then transport it to a processing unit to turn it into biodiesel,” designated food safety officer K Tamilselvan said. “The agents will pay the hotels for the oil collected, so they don’t lose the revenue they were earning.”

The department hopes agents can collect oil from large-scale food business operators in Coimbatore from February to kick-start the project. It has identified 150 food business operators who consume more than 50 litres of cooking oil a day for the initiative.

The project is operational in Madurai, where 8,000 litres of used cooking oil is collected each day from 55 food outlets and restaurants. “They have some teething issues, but they are being sorted out,” Tamilselvan told TOI.

Gastroenterologists warn against the reuse of cooking oil, which leads to short and long-term health issues. Studies show that a series of complex chemical reactions take place altering constituents of cooking oil and free fatty acids, ketones, alcohols and other radicals are released when it is reheated.

“While it often leads to acidity and indigestion issues, in the long-term, it can lead to stomach and esophageal cancer,” Dr V G Mohan of VGM Hospital told TOI.

Uttarkashi/Dehradun: With clear weather and bright sunshine since the early hours of the day on Friday, there was a much-needed respite to people from the rains and snowfall of the past few days. Both the plains and the hills of the Himalayan state received abundant sunshine and it also provided the opportunity for relevant departments to ensure that the snow was cleared from the roads and electricity supply restored in the affected villages.

According to information provided by state emergency operation centre, almost all the state highways were opened for traffic movement on Friday. However, around 50 rural roads, mainly those in remote belts, were still covered with snow and consequently remained blocked. The highest number of blocked rural roads was reported in Uttarkashi district. Meanwhile, the Met department predicted that clear weather conditions will continue for some more days.

Met director Bikram Singh said, “Similar weather conditions are expected to continue till January 12. Another spell of rain is predicted from January 13 onwards.”

Meanwhile, despite facing difficulties like blocked roads and interrupted water and electricity supplies, residents of Uttarkashi, particularly farmers and tour operators, expressed delight over this year’s record snowfall. They claimed that timely snowfall especially in lower altitudes will be beneficiary for agriculture and tourism sector of the hill district, and will eventually boost the local economy.

Apple farmer from Sukki village, Mohan Singh Rana said, “Timely snowfall will increase the productivity of apple, walnut, apricot, pear and peach. Even though we have faced difficulties like cutting off of roads and disruption in power and water supply, we are pleased with the snowfall, as it is going to be a big boost for our local economy in the long run.”

President of Uttarkashi trekking and mountaineering association, Jayendra Rana added, “Adventure lovers used to travel to high-altitude areas to enjoy snow, but now they will get similar experience by visiting nearby destinations such as Assi Ganga valley, Varunawat mountain top and Chaurangikhal, without any difficulty. Besides, tourists and pilgrims can also see sufficient snow at Himalayan shrines and high-altitude areas such as Dodital, Dayara Bugyal, Kedarkantha, Har ki Doon and Tapovan till April-May.”

Madras high court

CHENNAI: In a reprieve to industrialist A C Muthiah , the Madras high court has permitted the trust (Dr MAM Ramaswamy Chettiar of Chettinad Charitable Trust) managed by him to field horses in upcoming races organised by Madras Race Club (MRC). Earlier, the club management had restrained the trust from participating in the races citing a dispute over ownership and registration of horses bequeathed from late M A M Ramaswamy.

The court directed the race club to collect necessary entry and other fees so as to enable the participation of the horses of the trust in the classic races conducted by it in the 2020–21 season. The court also made it clear that the trust shall not be prevented from using the gold brown racing jersey which was originally allotted to M A M Ramaswamy.

Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy passed the interim order, after refusing to accept the contention of the club management that a public trust cannot own horses and participate in races.

Citing the Hyderabad Race Club case, the judge said, “Statute might provide exemption from tax to buildings used for religious, educational and charitable purposes and is, therefore, not an authority for the broad proposition that a public trust cannot be a horse owner or cannot participate in horse races.”

The issue pertains to an order passed by the stewards of the club dated December 27, 2019, directing the trust to apply to the club for ownership/usage of racing colour in the appropriate form, with the necessary supporting documents and fee. It further ordered that the trust is ineligible to race the horses pending registration of ownership and to use the racing colours pending registration. All entry of horses by the trust made as on the date were also cancelled.

The order was passed on the basis of a representation made by MAMR Muthiah, foster son of Ramaswamy, alleging that the trust was unfounded and that his father Ramaswamy was not stable in the fag end of his life and using it some persons had attempted to grab his assets, including the horses owned by him, illegally.

Challenging the order, the trust moved the high court contending that Ramaswamy disowned his foster son even during his life time and that the entire properties owned by him, including the horses, had been transferred to the public trust only as per his will.

AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi (centre) surrounded by a sea of Tricolour during the ‘Tiranga Rally’ to protest t... Read More

Hyderabad: Tens of thousands of people holding the Tricolour in their hands swarmed a public meeting place in Hyderabad on Friday to protest the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Less than a week after a similar rally brought the city to a halt, the ‘Tiranga Rally’ organised by AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi under the United Muslims Action Committee banner, saw thousands of men, women and the elderly march to the Shastripuram grounds for a public meeting.

It was the first such rally organised by MIM where protesters condemned Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for his silence on CAA and NRC.

Earlier in the day, thousands gathered at the Mir Alam Eidgah to offer Friday prayers before they began a 2-km march to an open ground in the Old City where Christian organisations, advocates, students from Osmania University, school teachers and children joined the Hyderabad MP’s march with supporters in tow.

“If someone from the government or police insists that you show your Aadhaar card, will you show it to them?” asked Owaisi, as the crowd waving the Tricolour replied in unison: “No, we will not.”

“If someone from the government asks your identity proof tell them you are Indian. I urge the government and police not to force people to show documents,” Owaisi said at the massive gathering.

While the ‘Million March’ last week was organised by some 40 small Muslim groups, without the support of Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, on Friday the Old City again wore a deserted look after MIM cadres urged traders to down shutters and join the march in an equal show of strength.

“Listen India’s Prime Minister, these people here reject CAA. I once again appeal to the government of India to take back CAA, stop the work pertaining to NPR and National Register of Citizens (NRC),” Owaisi said amid huge applause.

A sea of people was seen moving in different directions by taking narrow lanes to get closer to the stage where members of the committee were addressing the crowd.

“Leke Rahenge Azadi”, (We will take our freedom) “Hindustan Zindabad” (Long live India) and “Baap Ladey Goron Se, Aur Hum Ladenge Choro Se” (Our fathers fought the White people, we will fight the thieves) were the most common slogans raised.

People also condemned the attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students, apart from raising slogans against PM Narendra Modi. Woman who participated in large numbers also raised anti-Modi slogans and backed JNU students. “Goons barged into the JNU campus and targeted students. They have the support of police and Central government,” said a woman.

Representative image

DEHRADUN: The proposal for the construction of a biomedical waste plant was approved during the board meeting of Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) on Friday.

The plant will be constructed under public-private partnership (PPP) model.

The plant has been approved in view of the increase in the amount of biomedical waste collection in the city. As per the estimates of the civic body , the city produces around 300 metric tonnes of garbage daily.

“Hospitals and other medical facilities are fast increasing in the city. As a consequence, there is an increase in the amount of biomedical waste. Thus, there is an urgent need for a biomedical waste plant in the city. At present, there is only one biomedical waste plant in the entire Garhwal region and that is situated in Roorkee . The performance of that plant is not up to mark and our contract with them is running on an extension,” DMC commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey told TOI.

The official added that the biomedical waste generated from all the 100 wards of the city will be treated in the proposed plant.

Decisions regarding profit sharing, selection of firm, and others will be taken after further discussion, he added.

DEHRADUN: Several proposals relating to civic facilities were approved during the board meeting of Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) on Friday. The meeting was attended by senior DMC officials and ward councillors of the city.

During the meeting, ten different locations in the city were selected for smart vending zones. Two vending zones each will be put up in Gujrada, Malsi, and Harbhaj Wala ward. Danda Lakhond, Banjarawala, Nanur Khera, and Aamwala wards will have one smart vending zone each.

The proposal to make open gym chargeable was also approved in the meeting. The cost of gym's yearly membership has been fixed at Rs 1,800. The use of an open gym was made chargeable after it was found out that several people were not using the equipment properly. Casual use by some people has impacted the functioning of equipment, say officials.

Several locations — including Nehru Colony, Indira Nagar, Ekta Park, Vijay Park, Harrawala, among others — were chosen for developing open gyms. Also, the DMC announced that extra plastic dustbins will be installed in the city, especially in the newly added wards. Several councillors of new wards complained about the poor service of the door-door garbage collection facility, to which the DMC officials assured them that the health department has taken steps in this regard and the service will improve by next month.

It was also decided that people suffering from leprosy will be relieved from paying house tax. The DMC also approved the proposal to start social policing. For this, authority will be given to members of various NGOs, RWAs, and other organisations, who have a track record of taking initiatives to improve the sanitation condition of the city. These organisations would have the power to impose fine on people who throw garbage in public space.

“The DMC will shortlist some locals, who have actively participated to improve the sanitation levels of Dehradun. The list will mostly comprise of members from various NGOs and RWAs. They will be given proper training and will be issued with identification cards. They will have the power to impose fine the moment they see anyone violating rules and littering the road with waste,” said DMC commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey.

The DMC has also decided to construct a few wedding halls in the city. These halls would cost Rs 5000 (at most) for an entire day. After requests from the councillors, the DMC has decided to form a committee which will decide whether it is feasible to lower the charges of these halls or not.

Yet another important decision was to relax the property tax rates in all 100 wards of the city. The updated rates will be announced soon. Apart from the above decisions, some other minor proposals were also approved during the meeting.

205,['11/01/2020'],"Madhya Pradesh: EOW cracks down on gutka firms, child labourers rescued","This story is from January 11, 2020

The labourers rescued from a gutka factory at Govindpura. (R)

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh EOW on Friday raided business establishments of prominent pan masala and gutka manufacturers in Bhopal, Indore and Gwalior following complaints of massive tax evasions.

Several child labourers were rescued during the operation, say officials.

Raids were conducted at factories of some of the top brands in Govindpura around 4.30am. Separate teams raided other gutka companies in Indore and Gwalior. The raid team in the state capital was led by EOW SP Arun Mishra. Ready stocks worth more than Rs 5 crore were found at these units.

EOW had shortlisted these companies immediately after chief minister Kamal Nath ordered a crackdown last week. On January 3, in his first meeting of the year with bureaucrats, CM Nath had said: “Shudh Ke Liye Yudh is a massive drive that is gathering popularity through public support. But there needs to be action against gutka and paan masala sellers, apart from cartels involved in the manufacture and supply of fake medicines.”

“Anyone indulging in unethical business, jeopardising public health with adulteration or causing loss to the government will be dealt with strongly. We have eyes on all such people,” said EOW DG Sushovan Banerjee. A member of the raiding party in Bhopal pointed towards the stacks of gutka at a factory, and said: “We suspect they supply gutka packs worth Rs 25 crore a day, far in excess of what they have disclosed in their records. They produce the excess amount at night and by 9am the next morning, the ‘unaccounted’ packs are sent off to different destinations. They have 40 labourers only to load packs of gutka pouches in trucks, so you can imagine the amount of gutka that is produced and supplied from this factory alone.”

Knowing that the clandestinely produced gutka is loaded in trucks early in the morning, the EOW team raided at 4.30am. As they detected more illegal activities — like child labour and mixing of tobacco in gutka— personnel from departments like labour, revenue, commercial tax, excise, central excise and police also joined the operation.

Officials say the government had been trying to plug leakage of revenue from gutka and tobacco companies. Excise duty is calculated under ‘Pan Masala Packing Machines (Capacity Determination and Collection of Duty) Rules, 2008’, modified in 2010, and ranges from Rs 14 lakh to Rs 77 lakh, depending upon the price per packet of pan masala (non-tobacco) and production capacity of machines. For flavoured supari, the tariff is charged on MRP. Duty is calculated at 2.36% per packet, excluding 35% abatement.

It is alleged that the companies had been underreporting the capacity of their machines in collusion with a section regulatory officials. “We are involving various departments in the raid. There are multiple issues, ranging from adulteration, hygiene, tax evasion, child labour, labour exploitation, electricity theft, and GST. We will be comparing the volume of production with the tax paid. Machines will be checked to assess production capacity,” said an officer.

Considering the increase in average speed of packing machines, the government had revised the capacity of production and consequently increased the duty applicable under the compounded levy scheme to pan masala and tobacco products, including gutka, chewing tobacco, unmanufactured tobacco and ‘filter khaini’, machine-packed in pouches. “Manufacturers are creative enough to dodge regulators. They have machines that can pack 900 pouches in a minute and run 24x7. Their production capacity is beyond imagination,” he added.

“The manufacturer makes a declaration regarding the number of packing machines installed in the factory, on the basis of which monthly duty determined per machine is paid. Mismatch has been found in the declaration and production capacity of machines,” said the officer. The role of some excise officers are also under scanner for siding with these companies.

Hyderabad: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s silence on CAA echoed loudly in the protest rally organised by his ally MIM on Friday.

Many protesters carried banners against the CM, while slogans rent the air urging him to speak up.

After offering Friday prayers at Mir Alam Eidgah, as the crowd moved towards the meeting venue they carried black banners taunting KCR: “Kab khoon khaulega tera, muh khol kuch to bol” (When will your blood boil, open mouth and say something). Another read: “Steering apne haath mein hai, phir ye car galat raste par kyoun jari” (Car steering is in our hands, then why is car moving in wrong direction).

The anti-KCR posters stumped the state intelligence too. Since the protest against NRC and CAA broke out, this was the first major rally where public came out openly against the TRS government’s silence on the issue. The cops tried to corner the agitators carrying anti-KCR banners, but they swiftly moved towards the public venue. “Like CMs of other opposition ruled states such as Kerala and West Bengal, KCR should also be vocal about the draconian law,” said Mirza Baig, one of the protesters.

208,['11/01/2020'],Gauri Lankesh murder suspect arrested in Jharkhand,"This story is from January 11, 2020

AURANGABAD/RANCHI: The Karnataka special investigation team (SIT) probing the murder of activist-journalist Gauri Lankesh arrested a suspect from Katras in Jharkhand's Dhanbad district on Thursday. The suspect, Rushikesh Devdikar (44), was named in an earlier chargesheet filed in the murder case. A local court in Dhanbad allowed the Karnataka team to take Devdikar on a three-day transit remand.

Devdikar lived in Aurangabad till two years ago and ran a store there. Early on Friday, the Karnataka SIT, along with the local unit of the anti-terrorism squad (ATS), went to the house where Devdikar lived. An ATS officer told TOI they had come to Aurangabad to verify information on Devdikar. ""The suspect resided in the city till 2-3 years ago and operated a store. He had also taken a shop on rent,"" the officer said.

Jagdish Kulkarni, owner of the shop taken on rent by Devdikar, said, ""He was very religious. He took my shop on rent and ran a store for two years before closing it down. While leaving, he said he was shifting to his in-laws' place in Solapur.""

Police sources said Devdikar was picked up from a house at Bhagat mohallah in Katras, Dhanbad, on Thursday. He was working at a petrol pump in Katras for the past seven months, said IG (operations) Saket Kumar Singh, who is also the spokesperson for the Jharkhand police.

SSP (Dhanbad) Kishore Kaushal said, ""The Karnataka police informed us that the suspect is right-leaning and was involved in several other murder cases."" Police said nothing objectionable was found at Devrikar's Katras residence.

Lankesh was shot dead on September 5, 2017 in front of her house in Bengaluru. So far, the Karnataka SIT has arrested 16 other suspects in connection with the murder and filed chargesheets.

The investigative agencies from Maharashtra and Karnataka are working together after common links in the murders of Dr Narendra Dabholkar, Prof M M Kalburgi, Govind Pansare and Lankesh. Prior to this, the Central Bureau of Investigation, which is probing the Dabholkar murder case, had arrested Sachin Andure, who was from Aurangabad. CBI alleged that Andure was among the two persons who shot at Dabholkar in Pune in 2013.

PUNE: A section of the senior officials of the city’s transport utility have termed its team of in-house technicians as “untrained” and “inexperienced” in the maintenance of the newly procured electric and midi-buses.

The comment came a day after the board of directors of the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) approved a plan to float a tender for hiring a special team of technicians for the maintenance of midi-buses.

“The board accepted our proposal to outsource technicians for the maintenance of the midi fleet. The reason being, the present team of in-house technicians are untrained and inexperienced to deal with the new technology,” said a senior official, on the condition of anonymity.

As per the sources, the PMPML has a fleet of over 150 technicians, maintaining buses at 13 depots. At present, the public transport utility has 119 e-buses and 233 midi-buses.

“There is a staff crunch, considering that the PMPML continues to increase its fleet tally over the years. We strongly feel that the new buses need a special team of technicians. Many of the mechanics we have now were doing a completely different job before being transferred to the current position,” the official said.

“All the midi-buses have been manufactured by the Tata Motors. These buses have smaller engines and are technologically advanced. In December, two PMPML technicians had suffered injuries following an explosion in a midi-bus that was under maintenance. This shows how ill-equipped they are to handle these buses,” the official added.

A text message was sent to PMPML chairman and managing director Nayana Gunde on reasons behind hiring outsourced technicians for the buses. The reply was awaited till going to press.

The comments of the senior officials about the in-house technicians sparked dismay among the activists. They said the officials of the transport utility were demeaning their own organisation.

“If you feel you technicians are ill-equipped to look after the newly procured buses, why not train them better? Such comments clearly shows that there is no scientific and planned approach involved,” said PMP Pravasi Manch’s Sanjay Shitole.

PUNE: Over 250 students will undergo hands-on training in dental implant during the two-day summit that will start on Saturday.

Implantology is a super-specialised branch in dentistry, which is not taught in detail in dental colleges and awaits for proper platform. The summit aims to bridge this gap.

Dental Implant Care Foundation (DICF), an organisation working on upgrading dental implantology, will conduct the summit, Youthasia, in association with Sinhgad Dental College. “The students and practitioners can opt for careers in dental implants after attending the summit,” implantologist Mohit zamad, DICF founder-president, said.

The conference is exclusively for the beginners of implantology to undergo scientific orientation. Implantologists, including Nitin Vaidya ( Raipur ), Dhruv Arora ( New Delhi ), Sujit Bopardikar (Mumbai), Vipin Sood (New Delhi), Venkat Nag (Hyderabad) and Aakanksha Zamad (Nagpur), will guide the participants.

“This summit will benefit students who are pursuing bachelor or master degree in dental surgery,” Zamad said.

FIRs have been registered against over 200 housing societies in MP. (File photo)

BHOPAL: The war against land mafia in MP that started last month, has now reached its next phase. After booking land mafiosi and bulldozing illegally-raised structures, the government will now focus on providing relief to victims who bought plots in various housing societies, but never got it.

FIRs are registered against more than 200 housing societies in MP; a majority of such complaints are registered in Indore and Bhopal . Government has decided to address the issue in three ways. First, the district registrars having judicial powers would exercise their powers and pass relevant orders.

Second, a proposal has been mooted to have full-time public prosecutors in Bhopal and Indore; and the third is to bring the ADG cooperative fraud under the cooperation department for speedy recovery of such cases.

Officials source said, the chief minister has already given a nod to bring ADG cooperative fraud under the cooperation department in review meet of drive against land mafia last week and the actual process would be initiated soon. The district registrars are already on job to pass adequate orders. The government received around 2000 complaints against the societies in Indore and Bhopal. Out of these, around 1500 are from Indore and remaining 500 from Bhopal.

Principal secretary, cooperation department, Ajeet Kesari said that purpose of the drive would not be solved unless people affected due to land mafia get relief. It started after chief minister Kamal Nath declared war on ‘mafia of all kinds’. He ordered a crackdown on syndicates that run land rackets, drug rings and muscle into mining and cooperative sector. The drive was started in Indore last month and soon spread to the entire state. Various departments were asked to make a list of land defaulters and put members of land mafia behind the bars. Civic bodies are carrying out anti-encroachment drives in Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur as a part of this drive.

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath inaugurated the second edition of the Bhopal Literature Festival 2020 at Bharat Bhawan on Friday.

Speaking at the inaugural he said, “Any attack on the liberal exchange in arts and literature is an attack on India.” Welcoming the authors and speakers participating in the event, he said, “Madhya Pradesh — the Heart of India — has a rich culture and diversity. Such festivals will help in branding MP as a state of rich literature.”

“I heard that director of the festival Raghav Chandra said that such festivals focus on liberal expression and exchange of arts and literature. This liberal exchange is something we have to treasure as it been the ethos of our country. Brotherhood and tolerance are the ethos of India since the time of Ashoka and Chandra Gupt Maurya. It is our duty to protect this ethos as any assault on them is actually an assault on India. We have to preserve this for generations to come,” the CM said.

He further said, such festivals will help in branding Madhya Pradesh as the state of literature.

Seeing Bharat Bhawan quiet and secluded made me unhappy, he said, adding that more events like the BLF should be held regularly to keep alive the spirit of the multi-art centre. “After becoming the CM of the state, I felt very unhappy while passing Bharat Bhawan as there would be no activity. I have seen this place as a jungle, I have also seen Bharat Bhawan being inaugurated and seeing it in a state of inactivity made me sad. I hope more such events happen here and we turn Bharat Bhawan into a better Bharat Bhawan”, he said.

On a lighter note the CM added, “I am delighted to be here at BLF, I don’t know how politicians and arts go together, but I am here. Other than me only Jairam Ramesh is here and I keep my distance from him as I keep away from people who are more intellectually superior to me.”

Culture minister Dr Vijaylakshmi Sadho also welcomed the guests and authors and appreciated the efforts of the organizing team for inviting a number of noted authors to the City of Lakes.

213,['11/01/2020'],"MBBS, BDS fee can be charged only for 4.5yrs, not 5yrs: HC","This story is from January 11, 2020

Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Friday rapped private medical colleges, saying they cannot collect fee from MBBS and BDS students for five years when the course duration was only four-and-a-half years.

The court was also critical of the state government and Telangana Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee (TAFRC) for siding with the private college managements instead of standing up for parents and students.

A bench of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice K Lakshman pronounced the verdict in a petition filed by a student, D Padma Teja, of Warangal district. “The period of study of MBBS course as per the Medical Council of India regulations on graduate medical education, 1997, is only four-and-a-half years and not five years,” the bench said.

It said the private colleges should collect year-wise fee for four years. For the remaining six-month period, half-yearly fee should be collected, it said. “It was unfortunate that rules framed by the higher education wing did not provide an opportunity either to students or parents’ association before TAFRC decides upon the contentions of private medical colleges’ association,” the bench said.

Ripping into TAFRC and the government, it said this deprives the students and parents of any scope to protect their interests over fee fixation. “Neither the state government nor TAFRC seem to be bothered about this serious omission in the rules.”

The bench, in its order, said: “We accordingly declare that the action of TAFRC in recommending as well as the action of the state government of Telangana in accepting the recommendation and also in issuing GO (Ms No. 120) on July 20, 2017, permitting the private medical colleges to collect tuition fee from students for five years as arbitrary and illegal.”

The bench categorically said the colleges should collect fee for only four-and-a-half years only. It brushed aside the argument that the authorities were doing it keeping in view of the needs of those who fail in MBBS exams.

“Such exceptions cannot be generalised and it is unfair to ask all the students to bear the burden,” the bench added.

Representative image

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD : The Dehu Road Cantonment Board ( DCB ) will soon finalise the monthly user charges for garbage collection.

Ramswroop Haritwal, DCB’s chief executive officer, said the authorities have prepared the draft bye-laws for solid waste management, which were discussed at the monthly board meeting on Wednesday. “The suggestions and objections from the citizens will be invited soon, following which a hearing will be conducted. The DCB will then approve a resolution about charging user fees from property holders for garbage collection,” he said.

The proposed user charges for houses will vary from Rs 50-150 depending on the dwelling size. Commercial establishments, hospitals, clinics, and others too will pay the monthly user charges.

Elected members Raghuvir Shelar, Vishal Khandelwal, Gopal Tantarpale, Rahul Balghare, Sarika Naiknavare and Aruna Pinjan pointed out that the user charges for houses were too high. “This was bound to result in dumping of garbage on roadsides,” an elected member said.

Brig Sanjay Khanna, who presided over the Wednesday meeting, said the residents, commercial and healthcare establishments should segregate garbage at source into wet, dry and hazardous. The cantonment should collect the charges every month, he said.

Elected member Shelar said the cantonment collected Rs 200 as annual charges for garbage collection so there was a need for the cantonment to provide two bins per house every five years for garbage segregation.

215,['11/01/2020'],CM Kamal Nath rebuts Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s claims on new liquor policy,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: CM Kamal Nath and former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan had a war of words over liquor policy on Friday.

Chouhan, LOP Gopal Bhargava and state BJP president Rakesh Singh launched a direct attack on Congress and CM Nath, saying the new policy of allowing licence holders to open sub-shops by paying extra will turn the state into ‘Madira Pradesh’

On Thursday, the state government issued a gazette notification to allow opening of liquor sub-shops within a gap of 5km between two shops in municipal areas and 10km in rural areas. Congress justified the stand by terming it as step to counter adulterated liquor trade in state.

“The decision will lead to opening of 2,000 to 2,500 new liquor shops in MP. Congress wants to turn Madhya Pradesh into ‘Madira Pradesh’. The government wants unemployed youths to remain inebriated so that they cannot question it. Chief minister Kamal Nath claims he is running a drive against mafia, but he is working for liquor mafia. Opening of new liquor shops will increase crimes against women. When BJP was in power, it did not open new liquor shop and decided to go for phased liquor ban in MP. Did Congress mention in its manifesto that it would open new liquor shops? I have written to the CM to cancel it. If the decision is not rolled back, BJP will hit to streets to protest against the decision,” said Chouhan.

CM Nath was quick to respond. Chouhan’s claim that no new liquor shop was opened during his tenure was false, Nath said.

“When Congress was in power in the state till 2003, there were 2,792 liquor shops in MP, including IMFL and countrymade liquor shops. It increased to 3,683 in Chouhan's tenure by 2010-11. As per the population and area, MP has far fewer liquor shops than BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh . There are five liquor shops in MP per 1 lakh population, while in UP there are 12 liquor shops per lakh population,” CM Nath said.

The CM also told Chouhan that his estimate that the new policy will lead to opening of 2,000 to 2,500 new liquor shops in state is incorrect. “As per the policy, no new liquor shop would be opened and only subshop can be opened by liquor license holders that too with prerequisite conditions,” Nath said.

MP law and minister P C Sharma held a press conference to counter BJP’s claims and shared details of action taken by government against illegal sale, possession and transportation of liquor.

“As many as 400 new liquor shops were opened in the tenure of Shivraj Singh Chouhan as CM. Crimes against women were highest in the country during Chouhan’s tenure. With the new policy, government just wants to ensure that ones who want to drink get quality liquor and not adulterated,” he said.

Bhargava said Congress has started sale of liquor in religious cities. The new policy would add to incidents of domestic violence and crime against women

Bareilly: On the lines of ICSE and CBSE boards, UP Board of Madrassa Education has reduced the number of question papers to a maximum of six examinations for Munshi/ Maulvi (Class X) and Alim (Class XII).

Madrassa students earlier used to appear for more than 10 subjects but they will now have to write five compulsory and one optional subject. The madrassa board exams will take place in February.

During a meeting of board officials with experts, it was decided to cut down the number of question papers to facilitate students along the lines of other boards, including UP Board for Secondary Education, ICSE and CBSE. After officials reduced the number of question papers, they merged a few subjects. For instance, the students appearing for Munshi/ Maulvi exams will have one question paper of theology (Sunni/ Shia) for three topics - Tafseer, Hadith and Fiqha.

Besides, the board has introduced sessional marks in each subject in which students will be given marks on assignment, attendance and viva voice/ moral activities for the first time. The students of Munshi/ Maulvi will have 20 sessional marks in each paper while Alim students will have 30 sessional marks.

Deewan Saheb Jaman Khan, state general secretary, Teachers’ Association Madaris Arabia Uttar Pradesh, said, “The aim of conducting exams is to test the knowledge of students and it can be done with less number of question papers. As the board officials have reduced the number of papers to almost half, it will reduce the burden on the students.”

According to officials, Bareilly has nearly 450 madrassas. District minorities’ welfare officer Jagmohan Singh said, “In Bareilly district, 7,154 students will appear for madrassa exams. The number of students has decreased in comparison to last year as a few students used to appear for both UP Board of Secondary Education and UP Board of Madrassa Education. As exams of both boards will clash this time, the number of applications has decreased by 1,000.”

Members of rescue team carry software engineer Pravin Thakre on a stretcher on Friday

PUNE: His mother’s casual call to him from Nagpur on Thursday night saved the life of an injured software engineer, who had fallen 100 feet down into a gorge from ‘Wind Point’ at Sinhagad fort earlier in the evening.

The software engineer, Pravin Thakre (28), had gone to the fort alone. He told his mother, who called him around 9pm, that he had fallen into the gorge in the evening and was lying there virtually immobile as he had sustained injuries to his back and hands.

Shaken, the mother shared her son’s plight with relatives and friends. Thakre’s sister and two friends flew down to Pune on the first available flight and reached the fort on Friday morning.

A man on the fort, Mihir Behere, saw the trio searching for Thakre and helped them begin the rescue effort. Thakre, who works with a leading software company in Bhosari, was brought out of the gorge around 10am by two team members of mountaineering club Giripremi and villagers.

Dr Prashant Gaikwad of a private hospital in Khadakwasla, where Thakre has been admitted, told TOI, “His condition is stable now and he is out of danger. He has suffered lumbar and cervical trauma.”

Gaikwad said, “Thakre told us that he was clicking photographs of the sunset from ‘Wind Point’ when he lost balance and fell into the gorge. No one noticed him fall. He was unable to move because of the injuries. He somehow managed to tell his mother about the fall when she called around 9pm.”

Not knowing whom to contact in Pune, Thakre’s sister and friends began searching for him at Sinhagad fort by calling out his name. “But they were not able to trace him because of the fog,” said Behere.

Behere immediately called up Umesh Zirpe of Giripremi. “Two of our club members, Siddharth Jadhav and Atul Murmure, were on the fort then. They, along with Ghera Sinhagad deputy sarpanch Amol Padher and his team, found Thakre lying in the gorge. Our team members had a stretcher with them. They brought Thakre to the top within half-an-hour and took him to hospital,” Zirpe said.

Padher told TOI that Thakre lay on the grass in the gorge the whole night. “Had his parents contacted the Pune police control room, we would have rescued him in the night itself,” he said.

218,['11/01/2020'],Independent journalism crucial to health of democracy: US Consul General,"This story is from January 11, 2020

BHOPAL: No democracy can run without independent journalism. It is due to independent and strong journalism that transparency in democracy and government's responsibility towards the people is determined. Consul General of the US Consulate, David J Ranz, said this during his visit to the Makhanlal Chaturvedi National Journalism and Communication University here on Friday.

In his address, Ranz said that he respects the challenges and risky profession of journalism. Speaking on Indo-American relations in the conference session, Rainz said that the transparency, trade, values and not interfering in each other's internal affairs are important links for the relations between the two countries. ""Both countries have touched new heights of relations. India and America are geo-strategic partners, whose cultural values as well as mutual interests are common for development,"" said Ranz.

Describing India as a fast-growing economy, he said that multinational companies can invest a lot to further strengthen India's economy, provided India makes an effective change in its trade and investment policies.

On this occasion, Rainz also answered several questions raised by the media students. Answering questions about America's role on climate change, he said that large developing countries like India and China should take responsibility for environmental protection. ""India should play its role in reducing renewable energy and global warming,"" he said.

Talking about the issue of higher education in India, Rainz said that America has the best universities in the world. ""Students of India can also go to study here after fulfilling the rules under academic exchange,"" he added.

In the welcome address of the conference session, Vice-Chancellor of the university, Deepak Tiwari, said that the failure of journalism would be a failure of democracy, and for successful journalism, prospective journalism students are ready to question the authority in the public interest. Underlining the role of Indo-US relations in addressing the challenges of environment, unemployment and global problems arising from technology, Tiwari said that the time ahead is full of expectations but the challenges are no less.

Ranz is currently the acting deputy assistant secretary of South Asian countries (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives) in the US Bureau of South and Central Asian Relations.

219,['11/01/2020'],"DBT, SEC selection done as per law: Bedi","This story is from January 11, 2020

Puducherry: Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi maintained that depositing cash equivalent of rice in bank accounts of beneficiaries and selecting a state election commissioner ( SEC ) through a transparent and fair process have been done as per law and directions of the Union government.

“The office of the Lt Governor is bound to read and apply the rules and laws as they exist. Both the direct benefit transfer (depositing cash equivalent of rice directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries) and the selection of state election commissioner are as per law and also the decision and directions of the Union government. The Lt Governor’s office works only for the welfare of all people and ensures accountability in its functioning,” Bedi said in a WhatsApp post.

Bedi said the Union government deposits cash in the accounts of six lakh below poverty line families under the direct benefit transfer mode to enable the beneficiaries to buy 5kg of rice a month. In addition to the Centre’s scheme , the Puducherry government distributes free rice to all ration cardholders (20kg for below poverty line families and 10kg for above poverty line families). The government distributed free rice through the public distribution system for 17 months and released cash to the beneficiaries’ accounts for 10 months since June 2016.

“All of BPL and even APL population are now receiving cash under direct transfer of money to buy rice at will. Every beneficiary has a choice to buy it from the market at the time he or she wants and also the quality and quantity of his choice. Money has gone directly to beneficiaries’ bank accounts without any leakages. If this is not the welfare of the people, then what is? Leakages? Bad quality? Loss of money? Loss in distribution? Underweight or diversion of rice? Lack of supply? Non-payment of bills to contractors? Saving costs in distribution? Every month crores of rupees are being saved because of direct transfer,” she said.

On the mode of selection of SEC, she said selecting the best candidate would serve the interest of the people whereas nominating an official to the post will serve the interest of the political establishment. She pointed out that the Union government directed the Puducherry government to opt for an open selection trial to appoint SEC and not nominate an official to the post.

220,['11/01/2020'],Indira Gandhi had a special bond with Madhya Pradesh: Jairam Ramesh,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Rajya Sabha MP Jairam Ramesh speaks at BLF 2020 on Friday

BHOPAL: The first and last Prime Minister to walk the talk on environment conservation was late Indira Gandhi , said Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Jairam Ramesh here on Friday.

Ramesh was speaking at the second edition of Bhopal Literature Festival at Bharat Bhawan. Talking about his book ‘Indira Gandhi: A Life in Nature’, Ramesh said, “Gandhi called herself a child of nature … She felt very deeply about environment which is why India got four of its Acts on environment protection — The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, The Forest (Conservation) Act 1980 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 — during her tenure.

Ramesh said that Gandhi had a special bond with Madhya Pradesh and held many discussions with the ex-chief ministers of the state on conservation of tigers and the Bastar forests (which were earlier a part of MP, now Chhattisgarh ).

Talking about a letter she wrote to the then chief minister of Madhya Pradesh Shyama Charan Shukla after the moratorium on tiger hunting in 1971, Ramesh said, “Her chief ministers often disagreed with her. Indira Gandhi would write on an average 6-7 letters a month to her CMs on issues related to the environment.”

In one such letter to Shyama Charan Shukla she wrote, “MP is one of the few states that has not responded to the Wildlife Board’s appeal on the moratorium on tiger shooting. MP has a special responsibility in the matter as it is the most important of the few tiger’s remaining strongholds of India. In the interest of conservation of this famous and unique region of Indian jungle I request you to reconsider the matter … Strict measures should be taken to prevent poaching in all its manifestations.”

Gandhi visited Kanha just two months before her assassination. “It is the only national park or wildlife sanctuary she ever visited. She felt that national parks are for animals not for humans,” said Ramesh.

He also said, that the Environment Protection Act of 1986, came into being as the government realized the importance of such a provision after the 1984 Bhopal Gas Tragedy.

The Rajya Sabha MP said that because of Gandhi India has institutions and regulations in place that further the cause of environment conservation but over the years they have been weakened. He added that environment is a critical issue in the current scheme of things and should be given its importance in politics. “There is no denying that India is a developing country and needs development activities like construction of highways, industries and dams. But, we have to strike a balance between development and environment.”

Ramesh said that the Indian way of life is living in harmony with nature. “Indira Gandhi said Indians do not need to be taught about environment protection because Indians worship nature. Indian civilization is based on many living in harmony with nature.”

BJP alleges that the Delhi government has denied funds to civic bodies. What do you have to say?

What is your philosophy behind giving freebies?

Delhi’s deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia , is seen to be the architect of the AAP government’s agenda for education . In an interview with, he says unlike other parties which talk about religion, caste and ideologies during elections, they want people to vote on the issue of education. He says they wish to do constructive and positive politics and bridge the gap in the quality of education imparted to the rich and have-nots.Both as education minister and a parent, I am really worried. A lot of people called me from other states to find out if their kids studying in Delhi University were okay. This incident has worried parents across the country. Our universities, which should have been known for research and academics, are now known for violence. I am both sad and worried.It’s a political failure. Politics is not just about forming a government and spending money wisely. It’s about giving leadership to people. If there is an issue, leaders should proactively engage people and talk to them. It’s not about using police to check law and order — you need to find solutions. It’s true about any protest. During the Nirbhaya agitation, when thousands of people stood at India Gate, if the leadership had gone there and promised punishment to the culprits, things would not have turned violent. When a protest happens, our political regimes either become aggressive or go on the defensive. They should talk to people. I don’t know why they don’t talk. It’s not good politics.Issues and political ideologies will always be there. You have to see the future of the country. The youth is concerned about quality education, its affordability, jobs and a career. You have to assure students that we are creating jobs for you, giving good quality education. This is what he expects. You don’t do that.We have said about it at many public forums and Parliament. Our viewpoint is very clear. We are going into elections and have worked very hard on education. We had said earlier that we will do so much work that the next election will take place on the issue of education. That has been our dream. Whenever elections approach, people start talking about religion, caste, reservations, ideologies. No one talks about education. Fortunately, this has changed in Delhi now.The present model gives quality education and job assurances to only five per cent of people. It does not reach 95 per cent. They get a degree but have no assurances of a career, health facilities, business opportunities and family and can easily be instigated on religion and caste. If they are assured of a career and develop rational thinking, this will not happen.The biggest problem in expanding higher education avenues is the DU Act of 1922, which says there will be no affiliating university. It was not changed even after independence. A one-time exception was made to create Indraprastha University, and that was the second mistake. That’s why higher education institutions could not come up. Otherwise four to five good universities could have been built. To give higher education to children in a city of two crore, an archaic act of 1921 cannot work. It ties your hands. We have been requesting Centre but they never respond.For 2.5 lakh students who pass senior secondary every year, only 90,000 had the scope to get admission in DU colleges, IP University, IITs and other institutions. We tweaked the system in the first year and expanded wherever it was possible. As education minister, my concern was both quality and quantity. We spoke to the vice chancellors of universities and told them to expand seats and promised to give infrastructure and funds. Now the intake is 1.4 lakh. We have to provide for one lakh seats more. From next year, two universities will start working. The entrepreneurial university will be one of the biggest universities of Delhi and accommodate 1.5 lakh students. We opened nine vocational colleges in 2017. We opened two new campuses of Ambedkar University and another campus of Delhi Technological University. Two new DIET centres were opened for B Ed programmes. The B Ed programme that we had for in-house training has been opened to all. We opened a new Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University. About 16-17 new colleges have started.For quality, the status of a university cannot be judged by the placements it provides. A university’s standard is gauged by its research work. We asked universities to arrange 50% funds from market for their research projects and matching grants are given by the government. We keep a budget for that. And DTU, IIIT and BIPSAR have progressed in the research sector.I don’t think CAA and NRC can polarise voters. The debate is not happening on the merits of CAA. They are trying to make it revolve around the Hindu-Muslim issue. People have made up their mind. Other parties are trying to tell people that this is anti-Hindu and that is pro-Muslim. We say, nothing is pro-Hindu or pro-Muslim about education. If we had said this six years ago, nobody would have trusted us. But people have seen that education and health facilities have improved. Ninety three per cent of households have water supply, and these people are from every segment. People are very happy. I am quite optimistic that CAA and NRC are not working at the ground level.I see a big fraud by BJP. You need to change land use. One thousand seven hundred colonies are on agricultural land and government land with 40% in O-zone (Yamuna banks). You say there is registry and also that any law under implementation can be enforced any time – such as DDA Act, masterplan…According to the masterplan, a colony may be illegal. You can say these properties are exempt. When a court or NGT asks you, you start demolishing. In case of any order, officers will start demolitions and this paper cannot save them. That’s my concern.Let’s do constructive politics. Let’s do positive politics. It is good for us. Where was the conflict? SC has said except three subjects, we don’t have to send our files to them, it helps us.In the first year, we worked very hard on infrastructure. When it took off, we worked on teachers training the next year, sent teachers abroad where they understood that education is much more than classroom practices. Then we started a happiness curriculum for up to VIII and an entrepreneurship curriculum too. The narrative of patriotism has a very narrow scope these days. People are in love with the name of the country, its symbols and the Army, but they don’t question or rise when a bribe is asked for. A person sings the national anthem and claps in India-Pakistan matches and calls himself a patriot. But he is willing to give or take a bribe and deprive another person of his due. This is not patriotism. People follow traffic rules due to fear of the police. Patriotism is not limited to nationalism. People’s definition of patriotism is all about symbols. We asked children their definition of patriotism. They said saving environment is patriotism and so is safety of women. We are trying to teach these things in the name of moral education or civic sense. But telling children to be good citizens has become wishful thinking and not implemented effectively. We are trying to expand its definition. Twelve years of Deshbhakti curriculum will make them patriotic at heart.I can’t see anything. Economy is going down. I can’t call any area developed unless you provide education and health facilities. Infrastructure development is not the only development. They have destroyed education and government institutions.Lot of bridges which were stuck, such as Signature Bridge, have been constructed. Infrastructure is also about hospitals and schools, which we have improved.There were a lot of ifs and buts. Encroachments were a major problem. Things take time to take off. It is happening now. We could not buy new buses because of some court cases but now buses are being added every day. In next six to eight months you will have a huge caravan of buses. In fact, the SC order of July 2018, which defined the role of the elected government and LG, helped us a lot. Decisions are being taken quickly now.It’s a joke. We have given at least one-a-half times of what they used to get till 2014-15. We did not deduct previous loans and interest accrued on that even. So, we have almost given two times of what MCDs used to get. But there is so much corruption that they are not using it wisely and the money is going down the drain.My philosophy is that those who have not been given much by god should be given by law. What is the cut-off limit for giving things free? Everybody has a different argument about what should be free or shouldn’t be free. A larger debate on the subject is required. For a developed economy, the citizen should be confident that they will get good health, education and governance. You can’t build a country without that.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73197526,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-969543,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/education-plank-is-neither-hindu-nor-muslim/articleshow/73196353.cms

ARA/BEGUSARAI/PATNA: A JD(U) youth wing functionary was shot dead in a Bhojpur village for allegedly opposing liquor mafia in the district while a 35-year-old man with criminal antecedents was gunned down in Begusarai district on late Thursday evening.

Saheb Yadav, the district JD(U) youth wing general secretary, was shot dead by unidentified criminals at his Roop Bandh village under Jagdishpur police station in Bhojpur district when he had gone out of his home to answer the call of nature. The assailants were waiting outside and fired at close range leading to his instant death. Yadav, who used to raise his voice against liquor smuggling in the area, was rushed to the hospital at Ara where the doctors declared him brought dead.

JD(U) district president Ashok Kumar Sharma said the involvement of liquor mafia in his killing could not be ruled out as Yadav used to oppose them. Bhojpur SP (in charge) Sudhir Kumar Porika said two suspects were detained for interrogation in the case.

In another incident, the Saran police recovered the body of a 45-year-old medical practitioner, Shiv Kumar Singh, from Rasauli village under Panapur police station in the district on Friday morning. He had been missing from his private clinic since Thursday evening. The deceased belonged to neighbouring Nayagaon but lived and practised medicine at Rasauli for over a decade.

Saran SP Har Kishore Rai said a special investigation team has been set up to crack the case. “Prima facie it appears that Singh was killed due to personal enmity,” an investigating officer said. He had stab marks on his body.

In another incident, one Naresh Yadav alias Mini Naresh was gunned down at Kashimpur village under Naya Gaon police station in Begusarai district on Thursday night. Police said Naresh, the ward member of Gorgama panchayat, was attacked when he was sitting with a friend near his house.

Naya Gaon SHO Yashoda Nand Pandey said Naresh was an accused in murder, loot and kidnapping cases. “His murder is stated to be a fallout of gang rivalry in the area,” he added.

The police recovered one used cartridge from the site. The SHO said the assailants escaped with Yadav’s mobile phone after committing the crime. An FIR has been lodged against three named accused in this connection. However, none was arrested in the case.

225,['11/01/2020'],Anamalai tribals mint money with new lemongrass variety,"This story is from January 11, 2020

All this changed around 15 months back, when a group of scientists from Lucknow-based Central Institute for Me... Read More

COIMBATORE: Not many people know that in small tribal villages, inside the Anamalai forests , between Pollachi and Valparai, the exotic flavouring ingredient and aroma producing lemongrass grows wildly.

Hardly a few metres away from Attakatti, Anamalai Tiger Reserve, these farmers have been using the grass, calling “sukku pullu” or “inji pullu” to keep away wild animals and distilling it to produce the fabled oil and selling it for an income. However, over the years, they lost interest in it because of the low aroma quotient and oil yield.

All this changed around 15 months back, when a group of scientists from Lucknow-based Central Institute for Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) heard about this cluster and visited them. “We decided to include them in our aroma mission, which aims to increase production of aromatic essential oils like geranium , vetiver, rose and lemongrass,” CIMAP former director, chief scientist and nodal, Aroma Mission, CSIR-CIMAP, Lucknow, Alok Kalra said. “We gave around 70 farmers, from two settlements—Vellimudi and Kadamparai, 6 lakh slips of a high yielding variety of lemongrass, called Krishna, and gave them two upgraded distilling units to extract the oil and sell the finished product to traders,” he said.

Ten months later, the 70-odd farmers who tried cultivating the new variety in around half an acre each, are reporting 200% increase in crop yield and oil. “The farmers are getting a yield of 3 tonnes biomass in one cutting per acre, which is 2 tonnes more than what they got. Considering that there are two cuttings in a year, farmers are expected to see an increase in yield of 4 tonnes per acre annually,” Kalra said. “Though we have now tasked them with mainly multiplying the new variety and produce planting stock, we tested the produce for oil quality and found them to be highly potent,” he said.

One tonne of the new lemongrass variety produces 12kg of essential oil which has citral concentration of 80% to 85%. This is higher than the earlier 70% concentrate they derived. “The industry accepts around 80% concentrate and pays a minimum of Rs 900 per kg, but since these tribals don’t use chemicals, they can sell it as organic lemongrass oil and charge even higher,” CIMAP scientist in charge, Bangalore, V. Sundaresan said.

CIMAP scientists did not just give the farmers new variety stalks, but also installed two new oil distilling machines made of stainless steel. They also got another private concern Ultra International to sponsor two more distilling machines, so it extracts oil more efficiently. “These machines also use the earlier distilled grass waste to burn, reducing requirement of firewood,” Sundaresan said.

The forest department seeing the results has reportedly asked CIMAP to include a few more tribal settlements in the lemongrass cultivation programme, hoping the increase in revenue will keep tribals away from illegal activities like cutting down sandal or poaching.

Scientists estimate that wild lemongrass is being cultivated across around 500 acres in the Anamalai forests, in the Attakkatti region. They hope that eventually this belt will provide around 50 to 60 tonnes of essential oil to the aroma industry.

Bareilly: The rail track of platform number 2 at Bareilly Junction railway station is no longer fit for halting of AC Double Decker Express train that runs between Lucknow and Anand Vihar Terminal (Delhi). The authorities declared it unfit after repairs were carried out.

Officials said after repairs, the height of the track had increased by more than six inches due to which the gap between the track and platform shed has been narrowed for halting the Double Decker Express there. Station superintendent Satyaveer Singh said the train in question would now halt at platform number 1 until the shed of platform number 2 is elevated.

The station superintendent said the executive engineer (track) has given his approval to run and halt passenger trains on platform number 2 but the engineer infrastructure (works) is yet to send his report to halt Double Decker train at the said platform. “Until his report arrives, we cannot use that platform for the Double Decker train’s halt. However, regular passengers’ trains are being halted there,” he said.

Notably, the height of AC Double Decker is comparatively higher than the regular passenger trains. According to railway sources, the height of the coaches of regular trains is 4,025 mm while the height of the AC Double Decker trains is 4,366 mm.

At present, there are three sheds at platform number 2. Among them, the middle one has been replaced with a new one which is quite high but two corner side sheds are yet to be replaced.

Singh said at present, the movement of the Double Decker Express is suspended till January 31 due to fog.

“All (down) trains, including Double Decker, have always been halted at platform number 1. The problem arose with Double Decker (up) as all up moving trains halt at platform number 2. Owing to the current situation, AC Double Decker (up) is also being halted at platform number 1. As a result, at times, we have to stop the ‘down’ train approaching the station at the outer signal. And sometimes, the Double Decker waits at outer signal till platform number 1 is cleared,” the railway official said.

BJP’s Sambit Patra claimed Shoaib Iqbal (in pic) had been booked in multiple cases

NEW DELHI: Senior Aam Aadmi Party functionary Manish Sisodia on Friday slammed BJP after its spokesperson Sambit Patra hit out at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal over the induction of Shoaib Iqbal into AAP. Patra said that five-time MLA Iqbal had been booked in multiple cases and his induction suggested that AAP would do anything for votebank politics.

Sisodia defended the entry of Iqbal into AAP and rubbished BJP’s charges that AAP was engaged in appeasement politics.

“If a person who has joined AAP is criminal, then BJP should be ashamed that he is roaming free. Delhi Police has been under BJP government for six years, and could have put him behind bars. Now, BJP is talking about him only because he has joined AAP,” Sisodia said.

The deputy CM asked BJP to “place Delhi Police under the command of Delhi government if they are unable to handle it.”

“We will put all criminals whether they belong to BJP, AAP or any other party behind bars,” Sisodia said.

Before joining Congress, Iqbal was five-time MLA of Matia Mahal assembly constituency from four different parties. His departure from Congress is considered a major blow to the party just before Delhi assembly election.

Iqbal is known to have a big influence in Matia Mahal and neighbouring Ballimaran and Chandni Chowk assembly constituencies. AAP leaders say that his support will strengthen the party before polls.

Iqbal rubbished the BJP’s charges and said that he would file a defamation suit against Patra. “The remarks of the BJP leaders are nothing but a bundle of lies. I have never been convicted in any criminal case. Cases against me are politically motivated and none of them are of serious nature,” Iqbal added.

“If I am a criminal, why did BJP remain silent for six years when I was in Congress? Now that I have joined AAP, they are levelling wild allegations against me. They should take action if they think I am a criminal,” Iqbal said adding that BJP is afraid of losing the upcoming elections, so it is resorting to such dirty tricks.

To a question, Sisodia said it was an open secret that which party was an expert on polarising the polls. “Delhi assembly election will be held in the name of education and work of the AAP government,” Sisodia added.

Over a BJP leader’s call to boycott Chhapaak, Sisodia said: “It’s painful to see people getting scared of films based on social issues. How can they be scared of a movie which is based on an acid attack victim?” he asked.

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh is not just the rape capital of the country, but it is among the states where the maximum number of rape survivors have committed suicide in the past couple of years.

As per the National Crime Records Bureau , in 2017, MP topped the list of states when it came to suicide by victims of rape and sexual abuse — and 50% of such suicidesin 2017 were committed in Madhya Pradesh. In 2018 too, the state remained in the top, followed only by Tamil Nadu.In love-related suicides and suicides due to failure in examinations too, Madhya Pradesh was among the top five states in 2017 and 2018.

As per the figures released by the NCRB in accidental deaths and suicides in India (ADSI) reports for 2017 and 2018, rape or abuse was the cause of a total of 107 and 192 suicides in both the years respectively. In 2017, MP accounted for nearly 50% in suicides due to rape/abuse and 49 cases were reported from the state alone. It was highest in the country.

In 2018 also, out of the 192 cases of suicides where rape or abuse was the cause, 27 were reported from Madhya Pradesh.

The state was reported to have the second highest number of such cases in the entire country.

In both 2017 and 2018, many people committed suicide due to failure in exams in MP. The state was third in the country in reporting suicide due to failure in examinations in both 2017 and 2018. In 2017, 312 people committed suicide due to failure in examination and in 2018, 248 people committed suicide for the same reason. Love affairs were also among one of the most prominent causes of suicide as 449 people ended their lives due to love affairs in 2107. In 2018, love affairs was the cause of 403 suicides in the state.

Stressing on the need of mental health assessment of rape survivors, psychiatrist Dr Satyakant Trivedi said, “Mental health assessment of rape survivors should be made mandatory as it is mandatory in case of suicide survivors,” “Teaching mental health should be made mandatory in school curriculum. This would address many problems,” he said. “Suicides due to failure in examinations is increasing. Exams were there in olden times too, but the incidents of suicides were less. Kids have grown poor in stress-handling skills. They are subjected to a stressed lifestyle where outdoor activities are restricted.”

“Due to increase in social media, kids are getting addicted to instant gratification of needs. This is also deterring them from learning to cope with failure. Adding mental health in school curriculum will create awareness and address these issues too.” he said.

Explaining, an official who did not wish to be named said, “These doctors are probably working in private hospitals or in some other city. A few of them have not reported on duty for more than five years. As they have not resigned from their posts, their names still figure in the records showing that they are working with us.”

The absence of each doctor means that a post is shown as filled whereas it is vacant. This when there is already a shortage of government doctors, adding pressure to the health service by the state.

When contacted, additional director (health) Dr Rakesh Dubey told TOI, “We have informed principal secretary and state government about the doctors who have been absent from duty for years. The higher authorities will take action against such doctors at their level.”

In Bareilly district, 128 government doctors are working against the sanctioned posts of 229. Due to shortage of doctors, the district hospital in Bareilly does not have specialists, including cardiologist, neurologist, urologist and dermatologist.

Bijnor: Days after a leopard was shot dead at Bhogpur village in Najibabad tehsil by villagers, a highly specialized and well-equipped team, led by UP’s principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) arrived in Bijnor on Friday and inspected Mandawar area around Mohandiya village where a rogue leopardess is suspected to have killed at least three people in the area. Since November 27, six people have been mauled to death by leopards in the district.

The team of experts from Lucknow led by PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Pandey conducted an inspection of Mohandiya village. The photos of the leapardess were captured by a trap camera set up in the area. The thorough search for the big cat will begin on Monday.

PCCF Pandey inspected the place and saw the leopard’s pugmarks. He issued a series of instructions to the local authorities.

Giving details, Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran, “PCCF Sunil Pandey took stock of the situation and instructed us how to conduct the operation to catch the leopardess which has been lurking near Mohandiya village area. It had killed a 65-year-old labourer in a sugarcane field on December 26.”

Semmaran said, “We are bracing for a successful operation which may be launched on Monday. A team of experts from Kanpur and Lucknow will arrive to tranquilize the big cat. Besides, elephants will be brought from Kalagarh, Corbett National Park, for conducting the search operations. A team from Dudhwa National Park will fly drones to spot the leopardess. Apart from this, special cages are being sent from Chidiyapur, Uttarakhand. Scientists from Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, have been invited to monitor the operation.”

Since the leopard attacks on people began in November, farmers have been living in fear in the area. Villagers are up in arms as the forest department has failed to capture the big cat despite setting up six cages and a dozen camera traps amid the sugarcane fields of Mohandiya village. They have put baits like dogs, goats, chicken, mutton and cat lure to attract the killer cat but it has eluded capture. However, it has been captured in cameras several times, indicating that it is still in the area.

234,['11/01/2020'],Probe team identifies 37 in WhatsApp group,"This story is from January 11, 2020

New Delhi: The Special Investigating Team probe into the January 5 violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University has identified 37 of the 60 members of ‘Unity Against Left’ , a WhatsApp group that allegedly mobilised the assailants into attacking students and teachers. Of the identified, 12 were determined not to be affiliated to any political group. The people that SIT has identified will be asked to record their statements on how and when the group was formed. Like them, the nine students who were named by SIT on Friday will also be summoned for questioning.

Among those spotted in the WhatsApp group, 10 were discovered not to be students of JNU and efforts are being made to trace them. While police pinpointed Manish Jangid, secretary, JNU ABVP, as being a part of the group, the latter claimed that he was added to the group by someone else. He maintained that he realised this only after switching on his phone in the evening.

Questioning of some people yielded the information that the invite to join the group was sent through SMS. However, some of those who joined left within a few hours when violence broke out. However, the cops are likely to go after them to ascertain their roles in the mob attack. When the cops contacted some of the numbers that did not have names associated with them, they were either switched off or unreachable, but the investigators are tryingto track them individually.

Meanwhile, police have asked hostel wardens in JNU to direct the students injured in the January 5 clashes to record their statements. A temporary office of the SIT has been set up on the campus to facilitate this. Police sources said there was a list of 34 students who suffered injuries. They had been instructed to appear before the SIT. While some responded over phone, none has personally gone to police. The sources explained that the statement of these students would provide crucial information to the investigators since other than mobile phone videos, no other evidence has been recovered, with the security cameras having been non-operational at the time. The police team has already questioned the security guards who were on duty when the mob entered the university as well as the wardens of the hostels where violence took place.

The sources also said that while mobile phone videos of the attack were available, police had not been able to get leads due to the dark lighting and the masks that the attackers wore.

Senior SIT members agreed that the nine suspects named on Friday were only involved in skirmishes during the day, not in the evening attack. The probe on the clashes after dark, including at Sabarmati Hostel, is under way.

The cops will send notices to the nine students named as involved in violence by Special Investigating Team at its press meet on Friday to help the investigators in identify the other people seen with them in CCTV and mobile phone footage that have been recovered.

Muzaffarnagar: Opposing ideologies faced-off at the Grand Palaz mall on Friday as Bajrang Dal activists protested outside, tearing posters of the movie Chhapaak, starring Deepika Padukone, while Samajwadi Party workers trooped en masse to the theatre inside to watch it. The actress had courted controversy by visiting JNU recently, after students of the university had been attacked inside by masked goons.

According to sources, police rushed to the mall after Bajrang Dal activists were reported to have created a ruckus, and pacified the activists. Shenki Sharma of the Dal said, “She visited JNU, whose students are anti-national, so we’re protesting her movie release.” Soon after, dozens of SP workers wearing party caps arrived to watch the movie, evidently to show support to the actress.

SP’s Shamsher Malik said, “We went to watch the movie after [party supremo] Akhilesh Yadav instructed all workers to watch it, but we’ve been told by security that our presence can create trouble, so we had to return without watching it.”

Earlier on Thursday, a bunch of Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activists burnt Padukone’s effigy to protest her support for JNU students. A number of ABVP supporters hit the streets to raise slogans against the actress and burnt her effigy in front of the mall, where her film premiered on Friday.

An ABVP activist Dinesh Tyagi said, “Deepika visited JNU to support anti-nationals, we are against such activities conducted at JNU.” Another ABVP member, Aditya Sharma, said, “Rather than standing in support of the Nirbhaya rape verdict, which was pronounced on the same day, she stood with anti-nationals. We won’t let her movie Chhapaak be released in Muzaffarnagar.”

Bareilly: There was no respite from the chill on Friday, even though the sun made a momentary appearance in the morning. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast colder days till the weekend.

Residents woke up to a foggy morning on Friday, with minimum temperature standing at 6.3°C, 1°C below normal. The maximum temperature too declined to 12.9°C, 8°C below normal.

According to IMD, the temperature may fall till Sunday. Experts have predicted Bareilly will witness moderate fog till the weekend, but weather will change from Monday. It is expected that temperatures will climb upwards from Monday, when the district may witness cloudy skies with light rain. Weathermen have predicted rain and thunderstorm in the next 6-7 days.

Weather expert Neeru Agarwal said, “As the sun moves towards the northern hemisphere, the weather will slightly improve around January 14. However, locals will continue to feel the chill, because of the dry and cold wind coming from the north-western direction.”

With temperatures dipped in the area, it affected normal life. People were seen huddled around bonfires across the city. According to health officials, the chill has led to a rise in the number of fever and pneumonia cases being reported at district hospital.

Muzaffarnagar: A controversial BJP MLA in western UP on Friday suggested Pakistan should also make a law and give citizenship to all those Muslims who are feeling persecuted in India. He was asked about the ongoing protests against the recent amendments to Citizenship Law in the country.

“Let us exchange those who are feeling persecuted,” BJP’s Khatauli MLA Vikram Saini told reporters after coming out of a local court where he had appeared as an accused in 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. At least 62 people – 42 Muslims and 20 Hindus—were killed during the communal riots in 2013. Over 50,000 were displaced and some of them continue to live on makeshift camps. The MLA told reporters that he was “framed” by local police after the riots on the directions of the then SP government.

“The CAA and NRC are in favour of country. Hindus and Sikhs are facing persecution in Pakistan for decades now, and we are providing a shelter to them. I would like to say that Pakistan should also enact such a law for the Muslims who are victims here and provide citizenship to them.

“Those oppressed in Pakistan should come here, and those feeling oppressed here should go there. Let us exchange them,” he said.

Saini also slammed actor Deepika Padukone for sharing stage with protestors in JNU.

“The actress should not have gone there, see she is facing criticism now. Citizens of the country should think that her movie should watch or not? I think we should not watch her movie.”

In September last year, Saini had said that the country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was a “characterless” man responsible for the partition.

On August 6, soon after the abrogation of special status of Jammu and Kashmir, Saini had said, “All bachelors in BJP, who are eager to get married, can go to Kashmir and we have no problem with it. In fact, Muslims BJP activists should be happy, now they can get married to ‘gori’ (fair) Kashmiri girls.”

COIMBATORE: After banking on technology all these years to prevent man-animal conflict, the Coimbatore division of forest department now plans to look for traditional ways to curb the menace.

Even as the forest department plans to procure hi-tech cameras with a range of more than a km to watch the movement of wild elephants, it has decided to promote ‘ bio-fencing ’ to prevent wild animals raiding agricultural fields in the division.

As part of the plan, officials from the department would meet farmers and advise them to plant Suramul ( Cylindropuntia ramosissima), a cactus species, around their field. This thorny plant is traditionally used as natural fence in some parts of the country.

District forest officer of the Coimbatore forest division D Venkatesh said Suramul had grown along the elephant-proof trenches on the eastern side of the Anuvavi Subramaniaswamy temple in Coimbatore. The wild elephants and other animals avoid the thorny plants. “Some of the farmers from Karamadai and few other areas had planted ‘Euphorbia’ Species in their agricultural fields located near the forest boundaries. They told us that it helped prevent wild animals entering their agricultural lands,” Venkatesh said.

He said farmers from Coimbatore often complain about wild boars damaging their crops. Such bio-fencing would prevent wild boars as well.

The forest department officials claimed that the two species of plants don’t need water to grow and cost-effective.

To prevent man-animal conflict, the forest department has been taking various steps in Coimbatore forest division. Elephant-proof trenches (EPT) were dug around the boundaries of the forest to prevent entry of wild elephants into human habitations.

“We have to spend Rs 5.5 lakh for one km of EPT. We could not dig trenches alone to prevent the wild animals. So, we plan to introduce the bio-fencing scheme for Coimbatore forest division,” Debasis Jana, additional principal conservator of forests, Coimbatore circle, said.

240,['11/01/2020'],Narayanasamy moves Madras high court over free rice scheme,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Puducherry: Chief Minister V Narayanasamy has filed a petition before the Madras high court pleading to quash the decision of lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi and the BJP-led government in the Centre to deposit cash equivalent of rice in bank accounts of beneficiaries instead of disbursing rice free of cost to ration cardholders through fair price shops.

Speaking to the media on Friday, Narayanasamy said the high court admitted his petition and posted it for hearing next week. He pointed out that two Union ministries have taken a contradictory stand on the free rice scheme .

The Union consumer affairs, food and public distribution ministry agreed ‘in principle’ to provide rice free of cost through the fair price shops to the ration cardholders, while the Union home ministry insisted on direct benefit transfer ( DBT ) mode of transferring cash equivalent of rice to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries, he said.

He accused Bedi of questioning the country’s sovereignty and its democratic setup and posing unnecessary hindrances to the elected government.

“When all the neighbouring states, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, distribute rice free of cost through the fair price shops why not Puducherry? Who gave her (Bedi) the authority to stall the projects of the elected government? She has no right to do so. What is the necessity to refer the issue to the Centre? She cannot be forwarding each and every file to the Centre citing differences in opinion with the council of ministers. A referral can be done only in the rarest of the rare cases,” Narayanasamy said citing a Supreme Court order in a case between the Union government and Delhi government.

Replying to Bedi’s charges of corruption in the free rice scheme, he said the government will initiate appropriate action against officials indulging in corrupt practices. “After an extensive survey, we realised that most of the people preferred rice to cash and it is the duty of the government to fulfil the demand of the people,” he said.

Narayanasamy said public works minister A Namassivayam, who holds the portfolio of local administration, will also file a petition before the high court pleading a direction to scrap the move of the home ministry and lieutenant governor to select a state election commissioner and uphold the appointment of retired IAS officer T M Balakrishnan as the state election commissioner in July last year by the government.

He accused Bedi of trying to favour her officer on special duty G Theva Neethi Dhas in the selection of the state election commissioner and ensuring that the eligibility criteria set by the local administration secretariat matched Dhas’s profile. He said Bedi has no moral right to accuse the government of disobeying the Centre’s directions as she failed to honour the directions of the Centre on designating Dhas as her consultant and in redelegating her financial powers to secretaries, heads of departments and offices and council of ministers proportionately. He said Bedi designated Dhas as her officer on special duty while the Centre insisted on designating him as her consultant.

Bijnor: A 37-year-old station master of a local railway station has been arrested by Bijnor's Najibabad police for allegedly raping a 23-year-old woman on the pretext of marrying her.

Although, the case was lodged on December 19 last year, the arrest was made on Thursday evening. In her complaint with police, the woman had alleged that the man had barged into her house when she was alone and raped her. She said her family was out to attend a “jagran” at the time. A case was registered against the accused under IPC section 376 (rape) and 493 (cohabitation caused by a man deceitfully inducing a belief of lawful marriage).

According to police, the station master fell in love with the woman and wanted to marry her. Sanjay Panchal, Najibabad station house officer, said, “Police have filed a case against the railway official. Prima facie, it seems to be a matter of a love affair gone wrong. During investigations, it came to light that the accused was already married when he entered into a relationship with the woman. He allegedly made a false promise of marriage to the woman and also harassed her.”

The accused was arrested on Thursday evening and sent to jail,” police said.

BHOPAL: In what appears to be a clear co-relation between economic and educational status and suicide, 80% of the people who committed suicides in Madhya Pradesh during 2017 and 2018 earned less than Rs 1 lakh per annum and were educated only upto matriculation or less. This startling figures were thrown up by the national crime records bureau ( NCRB ) data released the other day.

The data from Madhya Pradesh suggests, less than 0.5% people who earned more than Rs 10 lakh per annum and were graduates or above committed suicide. As per the report of the national crime records bureau (NCRB) titled accidental deaths and suicides in India (ADSI) for year 2017, a total of 11,770 people committed suicide in Madhya Pradesh.

And of those, 9366 were either matriculation pass or less. This comes out to be 79.5% of the overall suicides that took place in that year. Similarly, in the same year, 8,955 people committed suicide which is again 76% of the overall suicides committed in the same year. But when it came to suicide victims who were graduate and above, only 377 people committed suicide, that is 3% of the total suicides that took place the year.

Similarly, only 12 people who earned more than Rs 10 lakh per annum committed suicide in 2017 which is only 0.3%.

In the year 2018 too, 82.9% people who committed suicide were either educated till matriculation or less.

And in terms of earnings, 74.5% people who ended their lives by committing suicide in 2018 earned less than Rs 1 lakh per annum. But when it came to educated people, only 2.7% of the people who committed suicide were educated upto graduation or above. And only 53 or 0.4% of the people who earned more than Rs 10 lakh per annum committed suicide in the same year.

Explaining it, psychiatrist Dr Satyakant Trivedi said, “The way to tackle a stress of an educated person is better compared to a less educated person. Same thing goes with people with high earnings, like in case of any problem or stress, high earning people have more resources and hence have more support systems, thus they are less likely to commit suicide, compared to people with low earnings”.

COIMBATORE: A 38-year-old man on Friday sought action against a Friends of Police coordinator for duping him of more than Rs 4 lakh.

R Jagadeeswaran, of East Street at Masakkalipalayam, petitioned the city deputy commissioner of police (crime) E S Uma, saying Friends of Police coordinator S Senthilkumar, of Nehru Nagar, had cheated him in a real estate deal.

Pointing out that Senthilkumar was engaged in real estate business, Jagadeeswaran said he, along with his wife J Dhanalakshmi, who is a private school principal, had approached him for a site at Kanuvakkarai village in Annur.

“We paid him Rs 10,000 as advance in 2013 and an agreement was made between us. We then paid him Rs 1.35 lakh in monthly installments. In November 2018, Senthilkumar told us that the site was not approved and that he was not able to repay Rs 1.35 lakh. He also demanded another Rs 3 lakh to arrange an alternative site for us and promised to do the land registration at the earliest,” Jagadeeswaran said.

Subsequently, Jagadeeswaran paid Senthilkumar another Rs 3 lakh on November 28, 2018. However, the latter went back on his word on land registration. “Later, we came to know that Senthilkumar and his accomplices had already sold the sites to others. When we demanded him to repay the amount, he not only refused that but also threatened us, saying he had good rapport with senior police officials and that no one would take action against him,” Jagadeeswaran said.

When contacted, Senthilkumar said Jagadeeswaran was a close friend of his. “The problem is between the landowner, Eswaran, and Jagadeeswaran. The issue is settled, and Eswaran is ready to provide the land. The complaint against me is only a bid to tarnish my image,” he said.

BIJNOR: Amroha police have claimed they have solved the mystery surrounding the murder of a man whose body was recovered from a field on January 8. According to police, the victim, a quack by profession, had gone missing since December 31 last year. His body was recovered on January 8 in a field in Amroha district . Local police now claim the victim was murdered by the husband of a woman with whom he allegedly had an illicit relationship.

The deceased, Amar Singh, resident of Jhundi Mafi village under Said Nagali police station, ran a clinic at Kakather village under Gajraula police station. He had left his clinic on December 31 but did not reach home afterwards. His cousin had filed his “missing” complaint on January 6, and told cops he had left Amroha saying he would be going to Hapur.

Police said his body was found in the jungle of Dakewali Dagrauli under Hasanpur police station. The investigation revealed the deceased had an illicit relationship with a woman, Poonam of Sakrauli village under Hasanpur police station.

Amroha SP Vipin Tada said, “Police smelt a conspiracy and picked up Poonam’s husband Nanak Khadakvanshi to grill him. He confessed to his crime and told cops when he found out about Amar Singh’s illicit relationship with Poonam, he had a fight with his wife. Eventually, he convinced his wife that the path to reconciliation was through her abandoning her paramour. She agreed after much persuasion, and started maintaining distance with Amar, but he tried to forcefully meet her. That’s when both husband and wife hatched a plan to eliminate Singh.”

“Poonam called him to their house on December 31. When Amar Singh reached, Poonam’s husband strangled him to death with her help, put his body on a bike and dumped it in the forest. Six days later, when there was no enquiry about Amar, they decided to pick up the body and throw it in a field close to a road, so that family members of the deceased found it,” the SP added, further saying, “Police have recovered the bike used in the crime and arrested the killer.”

MADURAI: Avaniapuram jallikattu will be organised this year by a committee headed by a retired district judge as was done last year based on an order of the Madras high court Madurai bench. A division bench of Justice M Duraiswamy and Justice T Ravindran made this oral observation while taking up a batch of petitions on organising jallikattu events in Madurai district.

The petitions included one seeking inclusion of representatives from people belonging to all communities on jallikattu organising committees and with regard to dispute in organising jallikattu at Avaniapuram . The counsels submitted that in 2019 the court had passed an order constituting a committee headed by a retired district judge to conduct the jallikattu. The judges adjourned the hearing of the petitions to January 13 to pass orders.

The court observation cheered up the villagers of Avaniapuram who have been upset at the district collector’s order that Thenkal Vivasayigal Sangam led by its president V K Kannan would be part of the organising committee. People burst fireworks on hearing the court order and distributed sweets to share their joy. K R Murugan, organiser of Veerakula Amaran Iyakkam who has been part of the protests for the past few days, said they were happy that an official committee was going to conduct the games this year. `` Last year too, a committee comprising a retired judge, eight members of Thenkal Pasana Vivasayigal sangam, 16 villagers and three advocates conducted the games. It went well though the prizes were less in number,” he said.

``When one person is not given importance, then we get to celebrate the games in a united manner. Now we can start organising and I think registration for tamers and bulls will start by Sunday,’’ said Ravichandra of Avaniapuram. Meanwhile, the district collector has ordered that prizes meant for any of the jallikattu games in Madurai should not be handed over to individuals or the organising committees. Any sponsorship for the prizes should be deposited in the account of the district collector, he said.

Meanwhile, the state government has passed an order permitting jallikattu at Avaniyapuram from January 15 to 31. The order was passed by the animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries department. A notification in this regard would also be published in the extraordinary gazette.

Bijnor: The city woke up to the shocking news of two brutal murders after bodies of cousins were recovered from city police station area on Friday morning. Police acted swiftly in the case and arrested one Narendra Singh alias Nanhe who has reportedly confessed to murdering the cousins during a drinking session on Thursday night.

In its official statement, the police claimed that Narendra acted in a fit of rage after he was cornered as an argument with the deceased during the drinking session turned into an ugly brawl. Narendra allegedly hit the deceased with a log, thereby inflicting severe head injuries and fled from the spot.

The incident took place at Dara Nagar Ganj village, around 12 km away from district headquarters. The deceased was identified as Sukkhe (40) and Prem Singh (41) of the same village. Both were cousins.

The bodies of the deceased were found on Friday morning near an ashram when a passerby spotted them. They informed the cops and villagers about the matter. After getting wind of the incident, villagers congregated and police also reached there. The cops took the bodies to district hospital for postmortem.

Police have registered a case against Narendra under section 302 of IPC. The deceased’s son alleged that Narendra thrashed his father to death. He took his father and uncle with him on Thursday evening.

On being asked about the matter, Bijnor superintendent of police Sanjeev Tyagi said, “Police have registered a case against the accused. He was arrested from a ‘machan’ [a makeshift shelter to guard the crop] in a field. He has confessed to his crime. Actually, Narendra settled down at Dhampur town, close to the house of his in-laws. He frequented here at Daranagar Ganj. He came here on Thursday as well. He met Sukkhe and Prem. He invited them to a liquor party. They agreed. The trio reached near to a temple in Daranagar Ganj and had consumed liquor. During the drinking session, they got into a heated argument and started hurling abuses at each other.”

Tyagi added, “The arrested accused told the cops that when they were on their way home and reached an ashram, both Sukkhe and Prem grabbed them and started thrashing. This led to a clash. Narendra found a log and struck it on their heads. They collapsed and could not get up. Blood was oozing from their heads. After hitting on their heads, Narendra fled from the scene and on Friday morning he learnt that both Prem and Sukkhe had died.”

According to villagers, illicit liquor led to the clash. Notably, Khaddar area is a hub of illicit liquor. It is manufactured in the region and sold at throwaway prices. Most of the villagers along the banks of Ganga here have reportedly become addicted to the liquor. Villagers had earlier informed the cops, but they didn’t do much.

Bareilly: A 30-year-old woman who had gone missing with her two daughters on November last year, was finally reunited with her family on Friday, with the help of local NGO, which is dedicated to rescuing lost persons and helping them trace their family members.

The deputy chief probation officer (dy CPO), Neeta Ahirwar, said Sharda was rescued by the police when she was found wandering in Aonla.

“Since she was not in a condition to give much information about her family, the police approached us and we sent her to Nari Niketan after producing to city magistrate. She had two daughters – a three-month-old infant and a two-year-old girl – when the police rescued her. For her to get reunited with her family, we took the help of a local NGO run by Shailendra Sharma,” Ahirwar said.

Shailendra Sharma said she couldn’t give enough information about her family except that she was from Panipat, Haryana.

“We approached the Panipat police and shared her photographs with them. The police further informed other districts and all police stations in Panipat. The information regarding missing persons was collected at superintendent of police office there. On Wednesday, they contacted us and informed us that they have the details of Sharda’s family members who had filed a missing complaint in Jind district,” Sharma said.

Later, Haryana police shared the phone number of the family member with Sharma. After being satisfied, dy CPO asked the family to reach Bareilly.

On Friday, Sharda’s father Maman Raj, mother Nanaki, brother Ravi and uncle Nandlal reached here to take her back home.

“My daughter and granddaughters had gone missing after boarding the wrong train. Since then we had been trying hard to trace them, but couldn’t succeed. We were quite afraid of thinking about the state of my daughter. Thankfully, I got see her and my granddaughters safe and sound,” Sharda’s father said.

NEW DELHI: The Kalindi Kunj road has been shut for the past 26 days due to the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests. As a large chunk of the diverted south Delhi-Noida traffic is taking the parallel Madanpur Khadar-Agra canal road to avoid snarls at DND Flyway and Ashram, residents of Sarita Vihar and 10 villages in the area are forced to travel for around two hours to cross this 1.5km congested stretch.The residents of Sarita Vihar, Madanpur Khadar, Jasola Village and some nearby areas in south-east Delhi have now decided to stage a protest outside the DCP’s office on Mathura Road on Sunday demanding that the Shaheen Bagh protesters be shifted to clear the blockade. On Thursday, a group even tried to shut down the colony roads leading to A block in Sarita Vihar and Jasola village.Ashok Vidhuri, a social activist who stays at Sarita Vihar, said the decision to protest outside the DCP’s office was taken after Delhi high court rejected the residents’ petition. “With the Agra canal road blocked through the day, the residents of Madanpur Khadar and Sarita Vihar need almost two hours to even reach Badarpur. It’s even affecting patients’ movement to hospitals. How can this be allowed? There are designated locations for protests; why do you create problems for others who have nothing to do with it,” asked Bidhuri.More than 2 lakh vehicles use the Kalindi Kunj road and a chunk of it is now taking the Madanpur Khadar-Agra canal road, which is not even equipped to handle this heavy volume of vehicular traffic. “There is a culvert here that has already been declared dangerous. Who will be responsible if it crumbles under the pressure,” he said.Raj Kumar Kaushik, a village panchayat member, said even children were forced to leave for schools two hours before the scheduled time. “I have to wake my child at 6am and leave for the school that starts at 8am. Since DND Flyway is nearly inaccessible now, we have to find our way through this snarl,” he said. Kaushik said police had also expressed helplessness in dealing with the mess.The snarls at DND Flyway is also impacting Noida-Greater Noida Expressway and during peak hours, areas like Sarai Kale Khan, Sunlight Colony and Maharani Bagh are getting gridlocked as commuters try to take internal roads to move faster.“We have been trying to convince the traffic police to deploy additional personnel to manage this mess, but so far nothing has been done,” said a member of a residents’ welfare association at Maharani Bagh.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73197900,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-163904,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kalindi-kunj-road-still-shut-residents-to-hold-a-protest/articleshow/73196379.cms

252,['11/01/2020'],New Year and new fitness resolutions,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Just a week into the new year, and with fresh resolutions to stay fit, hundreds in the city are flocking to the gyms in the city. Gym owners say that each year more and more people in the city become aware on the need to stay fit and healthy.

“Just within five days after the new year began, we had around 50 people join our gym. It is common to see those with fitness goals for the new year walk in at this time. People in Madurai are now more aware about fitness though the numbers are nowhere close to how it is in metro cities,” said Sukumar, owner of one of the biggest gyms in the city with around 2,000 members.

Both men and women are walking into gyms with specific fitness goals in mind. “Women mostly only come for weight loss. But I’ve seen both genders come in for workout to avoid age-related cardiac illnesses, diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol,” said Yogesh, who runs a gym in Villapuram.

With a gym on every other street in the city, residents will need to shell out anywhere between Rs5,000 and Rs20,000 per year on gym packages, depending on the quality of facilities, equipment and size of the gym. “I’ve noticed that many gyms are coming up with packages by which you pay much less if you take the yearly package. I think it is good because it makes us want to come regularly at least for the sake of money spent,” said Vinitha D, a resident of SS Colony.

While elite gyms boast of ensuring that members continue their gym sessions with follow up by trainers, some of the smaller gyms in the city are often seeing a loss of members a few months after New Year. “Seasonally people come and go. Some take resolution and then stop after a while. Usually, in my gym, if around 100 people come in, almost half of them don’t come regularly,” said Yogesh. The main reasons include no time to spare or is lazy to come to the gym.

Another aspect of gym and fitness is maintaining a proper diet. Gym owners say that while awareness has increased about the need for workout and exercise, many still refuse to believe in the need for a healthy diet. “I would say 75% of our fitness depends on our diet intake. You can’t expect to lose weight if you work out here and then go home to eat so much rice and whatever you want,” said Yogesh. On the other hand, some of the bigger gyms have staff to personally handle diet for the members and provide them with a workout suited best for their bodies.

<p>Gopal Bhargava<br></p>

BHOPAL: The state unit of Mahila Congress on Friday protested outside the residence of leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava , condemning the crude language he used to criticise actor Deepika Padukone’s visit to JNU.

On Thursday, Bhargava had said in Harda that actresses had no business with students and should “stay in Mumbai and dance”. “Heroines’ work is to dance in Bombay. Why should they go to JNU?” he said, and followed it up with a shocker on the state government declaring Deepika-starrer Chhapaak tax-free: “If it had been a porn movie, then too they would have declared it (tax free) if Deepika were in it,” the BJP veteran said.

On Friday, state Mahila Congress president Mandvi Chouhan demanded a public apology from Bhargava and his resignation from the post of LOP.

A large number of Congress workers marched to Bhargava’s residence, shouting slogans and carrying placards. Bhopal district Congress president Kailash Mishra and his supporters also joined the Mahila protest. “We condemn Bhargava’s mentality. Even after being in public life for so long, he cannot respect women. How he perceives women can be gauged from his words,” said Chouhan. “It is not entirely his fault, though, because the political party he works for teaches to be disrespectful towards women from the beginning. The result is Bhargava’s offensive and indecent comments, insulting women. We demand an apology in public because he has insulted women of the entire country. After that, he should resign,” she added.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Delhi Congress is likely to announce its first list of about 20 candidates in a couple of days. Sources said the screening committee held two long discussions to deliberate on potential candidates and almost reached a consensus on a few names.

The screening committee is headed by Rajiv Satav and includes Virender Singh Rathore and Challa Vamshi Chand Reddy, who were appointed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi in the last week of December. Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra, AICC general secretary in-charge PC Chacko and co-in-charge Kuljeet Singh Nagra are the ex-officio members.

Congress wants to be the first party to declare the names of candidates for at least 20 of the 70 assembly constituencies. Sources confirmed that some of these probable candidates have already been told to start campaigning.

“In constituencies where there are no doubts on candidates, we don’t want them to wait till the list is made public and lose precious time. We have told them to start campaigning at the ground level. The posters can come up later,” said a Congress functionary.

Those aspiring for tickets include several children of politicians, who have been waiting in the wings for the past few years. Sources said Chopra’s daughter Shivani, chief spokesperson Mukesh Sharma’s son Ankit, veteran leader JP Agarwal’s son Mudit, former Sadar Bazar MLA Rajesh Jain’s son Pratik, former speaker Yoganand Shastri’s daughter Priyanka, Jangpura MLA Talwinder Marwah’s son Arjun, former Model Town MLA Kunwar Karan Singh’s daughter Akanksha, former MP Mahabal Mishra’s son Vinay are keen to contest this time. In some cases, both father and son/daughter have shown interest in contesting the election from the same or different constituency.

The party leadership, sources said, is still deliberating on going with experienced leaders or trying young blood. A senior party functionary, who contested the last Lok Sabha election, has insisted that he will only file his papers if all other candidates of the 2019 polls put their hat in the ring. “Our aim is to give tickets to 35-40 young leaders,” said a senior party functionary.

255,['11/01/2020'],"In 2018, fewer farmer suicides in Andhra Pradesh","This story is from January 11, 2020

Representative image

VISAKHAPATNAM: Farmer suicides in Andhra Pradesh saw a decline in 2018, compared to 2017. Data in the latest National Crime Records Bureau ( NCRB ) report, Accidents and Suicides in India-2018, place Andhra Pradesh fourth in the country in terms of number of farmer suicides in 2018, behind Maharashtra with 3,594 farmer suicides, Karnataka (2,405) and Telangana (908).

The reasons behind farmer suicides are not specified in the report.

Of the 664 farmer suicides in the state in 2018, 593 were male and 71 were female. Data also show that 199 suicides were committed by farmers who cultivated their own farmland, 166 by those who had leased out their land and 299 were engaged as agricultural labourers.

K Lokanadham, district secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said increased input cost coupled with crop loss due to conditions of extreme weather, poor marketing facilities and low profits are some reasons behind farmer suicides.

CPI(M) and Communist Party of India (CPI) functionaries said a majority of farmer suicides in the state has been reported in the Rayalaseema region and scattered locations in north-coastal AP. Poor returns from farming have forced small farmers in parts of Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts to migrate to nearby cities and towns in search of livelihood, they added.

Left parties have stated that extending freebies to the agricultural sector will not address the crisis, and have instead demanded input subsidy, improved marketing facilities and profitable price for farm produce. Though the YSR Congree-led state government has launched the Rythu Bharosa scheme for financial assistance to farmers, some tenant farmers remain outside its ambit, they said.

While several committees have recommended that a minimum support price (MSP) that is at least 50 per cent above the cost of production be extended to farmers, the implementation of the formula is yet to be taken up. Farmers have been made the victims and their efforts have gone unrecognised, rued N Anil Kumar, a farmer from the region.

256,['11/01/2020'],Bodybuilding not popular as professional sport in city,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Despite a number of bodybuilders from Madurai winning accolades in state, regional, national and international levels, youngsters in the city are not inspired to take up bodybuilding as the choice of sport for a professional career.

A major hurdle in taking up bodybuilding professionally is money. “Madurai men have been known for bodybuilding. I’m training 12 bodybuilders in my gym currently. However, it is an expensive sport that requires dedication and also full support of parents. Monthly expenses can come up to Rs 30,000 for the food and supplements that need to be followed,” said Yogesh, a successful bodybuilder, who also runs a gym in Villapuram.

Bodybuilders and gym trainers feel that youngsters have a better chance of succeeding in the sport but have not been making use of it. “At 18, if a boy starts preparing for bodybuilding then by the age of 24, he will become a world class bodybuilder. It is the ideal age for muscle growth and good metabolism. Food and supplements would also work better then,” explained Yogesh.

However, the mention of supplements creates an air of fear of among those who may be interested in pursuing the sport. “Bodybuilding is a good sport. However, many tend to ask why consume so much protein supplements with a pre-conceived aversion. Parents also don’t realise that it is nothing so different from Horlicks or Boost that children consume,” said Dhanasekaran R, a professional bodybuilder who has won many competitions at various levels. He hopes that more youth can be lured into taking up bodybuilding by making government job opportunities available for them, including jobs in railways and air force.

Visakhapatnam: The Accidents and Suicides in India-2018 report of the National Crime Records Bureau ( NCRB ) points to ‘ family problems ’ and ‘ illness ’ as the primary motives behind suicide in the state in 2018.

A total of 5,319 persons, including 3,751 men and 1,566 women, committed suicide in the state in 2018. The report states that 1,610 people committed suicide due to illness and 1,515 persons ended their lives due to family problems in the state in 2018. Another 376 persons committed suicide due to bankruptcy while the number of marriage-related suicides stood at 412 for the same year.

The data for 2018 also show that another 85 persons committed suicide after failing an examination, while unsuccessful relationships led to 154 suicides.

A senior police official said rapid changes in society, inability to cope with pressures at work, family disputes, failed relationships and failure in examinations were the main reasons behind the increasing number of suicides.

While psychiatrists said NCRB figures for the state point to suicide as a growing concern in a digital era, police officials added that some suicides were motivated by trivial reasons and they have appealed to the management of colleges to appoint counsellors to address challenges faced by students.

259,['11/01/2020'],UP accounts for 93% of malware in India: NCRB,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Officials Blame It On Computer Illiteracy

Meerut: Out of 1,218 cyberattacks involving ransomware (a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid), 1,136 took place in Uttar Pradesh in 2018, according to recently released NCRB report. Notably, there is 400% rise in such cases across the country as compared to the 2017 numbers. In 2017, there were just 300 such cases countrywide, though UP had still the highest 245 cases involving ransomware then.

Even the states considered to be information technology hubs, like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, are nowhere close to UP. While Andhra Pradesh has zero such cases registered in 2018, Karnataka has seven.

The only state that comes next to UP is Jharkhand with mere 51 cases. Nevertheless, Karnataka still tops the charts when it comes to non-ransomware cyberattacks.

According to NCRB data, in terms of cybercrime that comes under section 66C (identity theft when someone fraudulently or dishonestly makes use of the electronic signature, password or any other unique identification feature of any other person) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, Karnataka accounts for 5,526 cases followed by UP with 4,285 cases. All other states are well below 1,000.

According to a senior police officer in UP’s cybercrime cell, “Computer illiteracy combined with negligence is the primary cause of ransomware attacks.”

The officer added, “In IT hubs like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, computer literacy is high and people are educated enough to take cyber security seriously. In UP where people have considerable access to information technology, they are less vigilant due to ignorance. Good anti-virus software and not falling prey to attractive but unauthentic lucrative baits in the form of cash rewards are some of the safeguards. Besides, there are times when small firms or individuals attach their backup data to internet by plugging devices into their systems. Such data is always vulnerable to ransomware. But considering the size of the state and its population, 1,136 is still a minuscule figure when compared to the way people throw caution to wind.”

NEW DELHI: With Delhi assembly polls inching closer, BJP functionaries have decided to address small corner meetings in densely populated areas such as unauthorised colonies for “effective outreach”.With the nomination process beginning Tuesday, the party also formed a 15-member election committee on Friday to shortlist “winnable” candidates from each seat and suggest their names to the parliamentary board for final announcement. The panel members include Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari , six other Delhi MPs, Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel, leader of Opposition in outgoing Delhi assembly Vijender Gupta, among others.Taking a cue from BJP national president Amit Shah’s address to booth workers at Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium last Sunday, the party leaders have decided that they will prefer corner meetings over addressing bigger public rallies. Shah is likely to address several such smaller meetings of 200-300 people in the next few days. Top party leadership, including PM Narendra Modi and Shah, may address rallies closer to the elections.Meanwhile, senior BJP functionaries said that they will focus on meetings with smaller groups of 300-500 people. “Such meetings prove more impactful. Big rallies require more efforts and people often show reluctance to attend them unless big names like PM Modi or Shah are speaking. We have planned smaller meetings for “target” groups apart from candidates’ door-to-door campaign and roadshows,” a senior BJP functionary said.Another party functionary said that more such meetings will be held in unauthorised colonies where the Centre has started giving ownership rights to residents and in JJ clusters where the slum dwellers have been promised pucca houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73197786,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-500145,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/bjp-plans-slew-of-small-meets-for-better-reach/articleshow/73197792.cms
261,['11/01/2020'],Centre may retender airport modernization,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Nagpur: Even though GMR Airports has bagged the tender for modernization of the Nagpur airport, the central government may ask Mihan India Limited (MIL) to go for retendering, said Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari during the inaugural function of the Liberty Cinema to Mental Hospital flyover on Friday evening.

Gadkari didn’t mention the reason and expressed hope that the Centre would not take this decision as it would delay the project.

TOI had reported on December 4, 2019 that the union civil aviation ministry had questioned MIL regarding the need for privatizing the airport.

This was because GMR, which emerged as the highest bidder with an offer to share over 14% of the revenue, would have given less than what MIL, the current operator, earns on its own.

In 2019, the earnings of airports were Rs49 crore. After roping in GMR, the figure may have come down to Rs15 crore.

Commenting on the broad gauge Metro project, Gadkari said that it had got in principle approval. “After the Nagpur-Nagbhid narrow gauge line is converted to broad gauge, we will run a Metro up to Wadsa. Before that, BG Metro will connect Bhandara, Narkhed and Wardha with Nagpur. Later, we will run a BG Metro between Chandrapur and Gondia,” he added.

On Phase II of Nagpur Metro, Gadkari said that it was expected to get approval of the union cabinet soon. “Then Metro will connect Hingna, Pardi, Dattawadi, Butibori and Kanhan with the centre of Nagpur. People living in adjoining areas will get a fast mode of connectivity to the city,” he added.

Regarding Reach III of Phase I of the Metro, he said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was expected to inaugurate it soon.

The city MP further said that work has started on the inter-modal station (IMS) in Ajni and it would improve connectivity to areas adjoining the city.

“The Centre has approved doubling of railway lines from Nagpur to Rajnandgaon, Itarsi and Sewagram at the cost of Rs6,000 crore. JICA had sanctioned a loan for rejuvenation of Nag River and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) needs just a small permission from the state government. Work will start on the project after that,” said Gadkari.

“We have sanctioned Rs68 crore for the Jaripatka railway overbridge (ROB). The detailed project report (DPR) of ROB between Shanti Nagar and Kawrapeth is ready. MahaMetro will build a cement road from RBI Square to Agrasen Square while the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will build a four-lane road behind Mayo Hospital,” the minister said on road projects.

Devendra Fadnavis, the leader of the opposition in state assembly, said that the city had witnessed an unprecedented development under the leadership of Gadkari and hoped that the momentum would continue.

262,['11/01/2020'],"Slowdown good, has changed govt’s mindset: Experts","This story is from January 11, 2020

Bengaluru: The current slowdown in the economy can be beneficial for the country in the long run, at least two experts said on Friday.

They made the observation during a seminar — Make in India: Making it Work — at Xavier Institute of Management and Entrepreneurship. While former vice-chairman of Tata Steel B Muthuraman said the slowdown has helped the government change its mindset, chief managing director of BEML Deepak Hota said it will be helpful in ushering in the new-age industry 4.0.

Hota said the sluggish economy is good for the country right now. “As per the Systems Thinking Approach, one needs to slow down to speed up. Now is a good time to pause and introspect on what needs to be done. This is exactly what the government is doing right now,” he said.

Muthuraman said the sluggish economy is leading to positive changes. “In some ways, the slowdown may help us in future as there’s been a change of mindset in the government, which one has not observed for many years,” he said, explaining that proposals to sell 100% stake in Air India and privatise the railways are examples of the shift.

“There had been talks of selling 25% stake in Air India, but 100% is what was needed. This change in mindset plays a very big part in the Make In India movement,” he said.

Pain points in the economy

Other speakers highlighted problems like financial distress in several sectors like construction, mining and automobile industry, and also the high cost of logistics that is discouraging investment. R Mukundan, MD, Tata Chemicals, said though there are bright spots such as the IT industry and sectors like chemicals and petrochemicals, several self-created problems have hit the Indian economy in general. “Unintended problems after demonetisation hit MSME demand and put pressure on consumer demand. Though Goods and Services Tax is a fantastic move, difficulty in implementation is creating problems,” he elaborated.

Land reforms needed

Experts stressed the need for capital formation, a healthy credit flow, simplification of labour laws, business-friendly land acquisition system and more. SD Tripathi, vice-president (HR), Tata Steel, said the biggest challenge in starting a manufacturing unit was buying land.

While Mukundan said land must not be acquired from farmers and that ‘they must be left alone’, President and MD of Volvo Group, India, Kamal Bali suggested: “Industrialists, who want to set up, design and make in India, may not be experts in acquiring land and may want just a ‘plug and play system’, where they come, decide on a lease cost for 10-20 years and start work. Because most of them don’t want to get into the process of buying land, which includes a huge capital cost and ownership title issues.”

NEW DELHI: With Delhi assembly polls inching closer, BJP functionaries have decided to address small corner meetings in densely populated areas such as unauthorised colonies for “effective outreach”.With the nomination process beginning Tuesday, the party also formed a 15-member election committee on Friday to shortlist “winnable” candidates from each seat and suggest their names to the parliamentary board for final announcement. The panel members include Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari , six other Delhi MPs, Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel, leader of Opposition in outgoing Delhi assembly Vijender Gupta, among others.Taking a cue from BJP national president Amit Shah’s address to booth workers at Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium last Sunday, the party leaders have decided that they will prefer corner meetings over addressing bigger public rallies. Shah is likely to address several such smaller meetings of 200-300 people in the next few days. Top party leadership, including PM Narendra Modi and Shah, may address rallies closer to the elections.Meanwhile, senior BJP functionaries said that they will focus on meetings with smaller groups of 300-500 people. “Such meetings prove more impactful. Big rallies require more efforts and people often show reluctance to attend them unless big names like PM Modi or Shah are speaking. We have planned smaller meetings for “target” groups apart from candidates’ door-to-door campaign and roadshows,” a senior BJP functionary said.Another party functionary said that more such meetings will be held in unauthorised colonies where the Centre has started giving ownership rights to residents and in JJ clusters where the slum dwellers have been promised pucca houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73197786,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-500145,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-plans-slew-of-small-meets-for-better-reach/articleshow/73196403.cms

The prospects of recovering over Rs1,000 crore by the civic body in property tax arrears by the end of this fiscal hinge on the results of 341 legal cases

PUNE: The prospects of recovering over Rs1,000 crore by the civic body in property tax arrears by the end of this fiscal hinge on the results of 341 legal cases — some of which are decades old.This was revealed in a reply to a Right to Information (RTI) query raised by an elected member in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) about details of property tax recovery and the pending legal cases. The civic administration’s reply also stated that the cases were pending in various courts, including the district court, lower courts and the Bombay high court.“The number of cases pending in the courts is huge. The civic administration should focus on the cases and ensure recovery of the arrears. Tax has been legally imposed and follows a due procedure,” said corporator Ulhas Bagul, who had raised the RTI query.“If there is any legal dispute pertaining to the tax as raised by the property owners, the PMC should resolve it at the earliest and recover the dues. Only amnesty schemes will not help,” he added.PMC officials said the civic administration has adopted a wait-and-watch stand on the legal issues. “Some cases are pending since 1988. Out-of-court settlements of many cases are difficult,” an official said.Vilas Kanade, head of the PMC’s property tax department, said, “We are taking measures to speed up the process to recover the property tax arrears. All information sought by the courts are provided with as quickly as possible. The civic body has also approached the Lok Adalat and explored alternative mechanisms to resolve the disputes.”The officials said the civic body had targeted to mop up Rs2,100 crore in property tax during this financial year, which ends on March 31, 2020. Till December 31, 2019, the civic body has collected up to Rs1,100 crore.The officials said the PMC has around 10.2 lakh properties in areas under its jurisdiction.

Representative image

BHUBANESWAR: The National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ) has sought an action taken report from the Odisha chief secretary regarding several incidents of pregnancy of minor girls in different schools across the state. It has asked for a report within four weeks.

The NHRC warned that in case the report is not received within the stipulated time, the commission shall be constrained to invoke a coercive process under Section 13 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, for personal appearance of the concerned authorities.

The commission passed the order on Monday after hearing a petition filed by human rights activist Radhakanta Tripathy last month on teen pregnancies in schools, especially residential institutions.

The petitioner alleged that minor girls belonging to SC and ST categories faced sexual exploitation in some residential schools.

Tripathy cited examples of three recent incidents reported from tribal-dominated Koraput and Nabarangapur districts. On December 12, a Class IX girl of a school under Taragaon police station limits in Nabarangpur district was found to be pregnant.

On December 8, a Class X girl of a tribal residential school in Koraput district was found to be pregnant during a medical checkup.

Similarly, on December 4, a Class VII girl of a residential school in Koraput district was found to be pregnant.

The husband of the school principal was arrested for allegedly raping the minor.

The petitioner also pointed out the incident of March 2015 when the then SC and ST development minister, Lal Bihari Himirika, had disclosed the names of 17 sexually abused children in the assembly. Himirika, while reading out the list, had also given details of their schools and the classes they studied.

The state runs more than 1000 such residential schools, known as ashram or sevashram schools. More than three lakh students study in these schools. Most of the students stay free of cost in the hostels. “It is the responsibility of the state government to give the girls a safe environment,” the petitioner said.

He also requested the NHRC to monitor preventive and punitive actions taken by the state government and take legal action against errant officials, elected representatives and culprits and rehabilitate all the victims after ensuring their basic human rights.

267,['11/01/2020'],Frequent changes in diversions on Sirsi Circle flyover peeve motorists,"This story is from January 11, 2020

BENGALURU: Motorists entering the city from Mysuru Road continue to brave snarls and bumper-to-bumper traffic, thanks to BBMP’s inept handling of diversions on Sirsi Circle flyover, which have been put in place to facilitate maintenance work on the elevated corridor.

Most motorists take the flyover prepared for the worst as they’re aware of the ongoing work. Yet, frequent changes in diversions without prior notice are leaving them stumped and forcing them to spend a long time at the wheel to reach their destinations.

BBMP introduced a series of curbs on December 16 to facilitate relaying work on the carriageway leading from Sirsi Circle to Town Hall.

On Friday, motorists who took the flyover hoping to reach Town Hall were in for a shock at the down ramp of TCM Royan Road. With barricades stopping them from moving ahead, they had to go down the ramp and enter TCM Royan Road. Those heading towards Town Hall had to take a right, enter congested streets and reach KR Market before moving on to NR Road.

“I would take only 10 minutes to cover the 2.5km distance even after the diversions were enforced last month. But on Friday, it took me more than an hour,” said Nanda Kumar, who frequently rides on the flyover.

A check by TOI found cars stranded for over an hour on the flyover. While TCM Royan Road was clogged, the diversion through Baskhb Garden Road was too narrow for even two cars to move side by side.

“I was stuck on the flyover from 2.30pm to 3.15pm and traffic didn’t move an inch. When vehicles finally began to move, we were forced to get down TCM Royan Road ramp, take a right near Bakshi Garden and head towards KR Market,” said Prashanth Kumar, a salesman working with a private firm. “I missed an important meeting,” he added, blaming BBMP for the mess.

Many commuters using the flyover said BBMP is complicating things by changing diversions without keeping citizens in the loop. “First, it allowed vehicles heading into the city to use the flyover till the Town Hall, while those coming in the opposite direction were to exit at Briand Square down ramp and get into Chamarajpet to move towards Sirsi Circle. On Friday, we had to get down at TCM Royan Road ramp as barricades had suddenly been installed,” Nanda Kumar rued.

“The bus traffic near KR Market is the biggest problem. There are at least 10 buses exiting Kalasipalya and the market area at any point of time, due to which we had to wait longer,” said Ajmal Khan, a frequent commuter and resident of Deepanjalinagar.

A senior BBMP official said their options are limited and they are doing everything to ease traffic. “Till the surfacing work is over, diversions will be in place. People will have to bear with them,” the official said. The work will be over within a month, he added.

‘His desire is phenomenal’

BENGALURU: On Friday, St Joseph’s Boys’ High School instituted a new award for an outstanding achievement — first time in its 161-year history, one of its students did not miss a single class in 12 years of schooling.Eighteen-year-old Naman Bipin Bafna has to his credit 100% attendance from class 1 to 12. According to school authorities, this is the first time that one of their students has achieved this feat.Naman attributes this impeccable record to his passion for fitness throughout school life. “I hardly ate food from outside, barring from the canteen a couple of times a month. I was into sports — athletics, football, cricket , basketball — and I was focused on my health and stamina. I ate fresh and healthy homemade food and stayed away from junk,” says Naman, adding, “My parents always motivated me to go to school.”“Once when in class 5 or 6, I had fever , but I still went to school because there was something important happening that day. Other times, whenever I fell sick, it was either a weekend or during some holiday,” he recalls.Naman, who is currently pursuing BCom at St Joseph’s College of Commerce, doesn’t have 100% attendance now as he has to simultaneously prepare for Chartered Accountant because of which he has to miss classes once in a while. “But still I’m the one with the highest attendance,” he says.The teen, who scored 90% in class 10 and 91% in class 12 exams, says he was never even tempted to bunk classes. “School was fun. What would I do sitting at home,” he quips.Naman’s father Bipin Bafna, a textile businessman and resident of Avenue Road, says it was his son’s love for school that drove him to Museum Road every day.Naman’s younger brother, also a student of St Joseph’s Boys’ High School, is treading the same path. The eighth grader has not missed a single day single UKG. “I hope he will manage to maintain this record. It’s special,” says Naman.Naman’s passion to come to school is extremely heartening.

Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has not presented the annual statement of accounts for the last eight years.

The statement is important as details of the expense in the annual budget and its performance are given in this statement. The civic body had made the report available to the public last in 2011-12.

Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group, has sought the information under the Right to Information Act (RTI). The group claimed that the reports have been kept unattended at the PMC’s printing press.

Vivek Velankar of the manch said the civic administration was expected to present the report as soon as the financial year was complete. The elected members of the PMC are expected to get these reports. They are also available for citizens who have to buy them.

“The information that we have got in the reply to the Right to Information Act application is shocking. The civic administration has prepared these reports, but they have been kept unattended at the printing press. They are neither available to the standing committee chairman, nor to the elected members nor to the people,” he said.

According to the Municipal Act, annual administration report and statement of accounts is mandatory.

“The publication and submission of these reports is a must. We will make sure that the reports for our tenure are published. The previous reports are not part of my jurisdiction, but I will speak with the civic officials and seek a follow-up,” Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee, said.

Ambrish Galinde, head of the PMC’s audit department, said the civic administration will make the reports available for the citizens, online. “We have completed the works for all reports, except for two years. We will upload the completed reports online. They will be updated on the official website of the PMC,” he said.

Madurai: The state government has informed the Madras high court that it is taking steps to provide police protection to the elected local body representatives when they submit applications with genuine apprehensions.

The state said this in reply to a petition moved by a former DMK minister seeking police protection for the elected DMK union councillors from Virudhunagar district to enable them cast their votes for the ensuing indirect election on January 11.

In his petition, the DMK MLA of Aruppukottai constituency K K S S R Ramachandran, stated that the DMK party has gained majority seats in the nine panchayat unions in Virudhunagar district.

The ruling AIADMK members in connivance with the government officials and police officers with the help of antisocial elements are attempting to kidnap the elected DMK councillors.

He stated that attempts were also made to intimidate the councillors and their family members to prevent them from casting their votes for the indirect election for the posts of chairman and vice-chairman of panchayat unions which is to be conducted on January 11.

Ramachandran said that he had submitted a representation to police officials seeking protection for the elected representatives of DMK for them to take part in the indirect election.

Since there was no positive response from police officials, he moved the high court Madurai bench. When the case was heard on Friday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran recorded the state’s submission and disposed of the petition.

Pune: Luxury carmakers in the country recorded a decline of a cumulative 15% in sales in 2019.

The top three luxury car sellers in the country, Mercedes Benz India, BMW India and Audi India, sold a cumulative 28,021 cars in 2019 compared to 33,111 in 2018, according to the data from respective companies. The top three automakers account for about 85% of the luxury car market in India.

According to market players, apart from slow economic environment, luxury car sales was also hit by high taxes. Apart from 28% GST, luxury car buyers also have to pay a 15% surcharge on buying luxury cars.

“We fail to understand this. Luxury cars generally bring in new technology and safety features, which soon become a standard in the industry. It does not help that the government views luxury cars as some sin goods,” a top executive of a luxury car maker said.

“If the government cuts taxes, more people will buy and even at 28% GST the government will end up earning equal or more revenue,” an executive of a luxury car seller said.

274,['11/01/2020'],20-yr-old woman in Bihar seeks divorce as hubby avoids regular shave and bath,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: In a bizarre case, a 20-year-old woman from Vaishali district has sought divorce claiming that her husband stinks as he does not shave, take bath and brush his teeth regularly. She also complained that her husband doesn’t follow etiquette and manners.

The state women’s commission (SWC) listened to Soni Devi’s complaint and asked her husband Manish Ram (23) to mend his ways within two months. Or else, the commission would take appropriate action on the complaint.

SWC member Pratima Sinha said on Friday that Soni, a resident of Nayagaon village under Desri block in Vaishali district, approached the commission on Thursday seeking divorce from her husband. “I was taken aback by her silly reasons cited for seeking divorce,” Pratima said.

In her petition, the woman said she was married to Manish, a plumber by profession, in 2017. “My husband stinks as he won’t shave and bathe for nearly 10 days at stretch. Moreover, he doesn’t brush his teeth. He also doesn’t have manners and follow etiquettes,” the petitioner alleged.

The SWC member said the complainant was adamant on her demand for separation from her husband. “I don’t want to live with my husband anymore. I can no longer bear the humiliation. Kindly get me rid of this man (read husband); he has ruined my life,” Pratima quoted Soni as saying.

Soni also insisted on her husband return the jewellery and other valuables, which her father had given as dowry at the time of marriage . “We have no children. Even our relationship as a husband and wife is not cordial. Life has no meaning. It’s worthless,” she told the commission.

The SWC member said she tried to convince the couple not to break their marital bond. “I have given her husband two months’ time to mend his ways. If his behaviour is not found satisfactory even after that, we will take appropriate action and refer the matter to the family court for separation,” Pratima told this newspaper.

Manish, when contacted, said, “Hum saath rahna chahte hain (I want to live together).” He was a bit nervous over the development and said he would mend his ways and try to win the confidence of his wife.

Though Soni is not a convent educated woman and belongs to a lower middle class scheduled caste family, but she is aware of the happening around and also knows her rights, Pratima said.

When asked whether the commission was empowered to do anything in such a case, the SCW member said, “We mainly play the role of an arbitrator on such issues.”

Elaborating further, Pratima said, “At least we can help the woman by pursuing her in-laws’ to return the valuables. It’s true that she will have to approach the family court for final separation. We will cooperate with her. But our first priority is to settle the matter.”

Pratima also said she had come across such a complaint for the first time ever since she took over as a member of the commission. “Divorce is taken by married couples’ on petty issues, which is not a good sign,” she added.

Nainital: The State Pollution Control Board on Friday informed the Uttarakhand high court (HC) that it has held a meeting to set up Medical Waste Management Plants in at least two locations in the state.

The SPCB, in an affidavit, also informed the bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma that it has selected Almora and Narendra Nagar for establishing these facilities. “The SPCB has said that it has already invited Letters of Interests for developing the Medical Waste Processing Plants that are to be developed at these two locations,” said a lawyer appearing for the petitioner.

The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has been hearing a clutch of petitions that had highlighted the monopoly enjoyed by two private biomedical waste and disposal management facilities. The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) also states that both the plants are in plains (Roorkee and Rudrapur) and therefore the waste generated in the hills are not being disposed properly which ultimately affects the ecology of the sensitive region of the state.

“The SPCB has also said that both the plants are proposed in hills to cater to the waste generated there. The affidavit added that the committee set up after the meetings of SPCB and secretaries of the urban development, health and industries will decide other locations to develop such facilities,” the lawyer said, adding that the court will hear the matter next on February 11.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Khadki Cantonment Board on Friday started demolishing the dilapidated old elevated storage reservoir in the busy Khadki bazaar to prevent any accident.

The demolition process began in the morning with the cantonment employees and policemen barricading the roads around the elevated storage reservoir (ESR). The staircase of the ESR was demolished around 3pm.

Several vendors of Sanjay Gandhi market were barred from selling vegetables on handcarts near the ESR because of the demolition work. The work had to be conducted slowly because a large complex — Shewale Towers — is located nearby.

Pramod Singh, the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Khadki Cantonment Board ( KCB ), said, “We had asked the PMC ( Pune Municipal Corporation ) to demolish the dilapidated ESR to prevent any accidents, but in vain. As a result, the cantonment took the decision to demolish the ESR and demand reimbursement of expenditure from PMC.”

Singh said, “The KCB has awarded the contract for demolishing the ESR at a cost of Rs43.51 lakh and will demand reimbursement from the PMC. If it does not reimburse this expenditure, we can adjust it against the water tax the cantonment has to pay to it. The contractor has accepted the condition that he will be held responsible if there is any mishap during the demolition process.”

The public health engineering (PHE) department, now known as Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP), had built the ESR having a capacity of 22 lakh litres at Khadki bazaar in 1976 for supplying water to the bazaar area at a cost of Rs30 lakh then. In 1988-89, the state government abolished the PHE and the PMC took over the water supply distribution work in the KCB limits.

The PMC had declared this ESR “unsafe” in May 2007 but still used it to supply water to Khadki bazaar by filling it up less than its capacity. There was lot of bickering between the KCB and the PMC over who would demolish the ESR and the construction of the new ESR.

NEW DELHI: The clashes on JNU campus were triggered by the assault of four students who had gone to register for the winter semester on Sunday morning, according to Delhi Police ’s Special Investigation Team. On Friday, the SIT officially narrated the sequence of events starting from January 3 till January 5, established after speaking to around 200 students, campus residents and teachers.The tensions began at 1pm on January 3, said SIT chief Joy Tirkey, DCP (Crime), when some students affiliated to the Left-backed students’ union entered the registration centre at the School of Social Science and heckled the staff to cease the registration process. After they forcibly shut down the server, the registration process came to a halt.Since it was a centralised server, the whole system had to be rebooted, which took around four hours. The JNU administration informed the cops about this and the restoration process was conducted under police protection. An FIR was registered, in which police named JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh and a few other students.On January 4, after overwhelming the JNU security guards, some students broke open the door at the rear of the building in which registration was taking place. They allegedly manhandled the staff, tore out the server wires and vandalised the computerised system. This led to the CCTV cameras, biometric systems at the administrative block, the JNU website and security features going off. In its complaint to police, the JNU administration named Ghosh and 19 others.The third wave of violence took place around 11.30am on Sunday, when four students reached the registration centre and were waiting outside. Since the servers were out of order, the process was being conducted manually. A group of 15-20, allegedly from leftist student organisations, arrived and harassed the quartet. This was captured in a mobile phone video.The cops said that later at around 3.45pm, some masked intruders entered Periyar Hostel and attacked some residents. They also vandalised hostel property. In a video of this incident captured on CCTV, Chunchun Kumar was seen pelting stones with one hand while his other hand held a stick. Ghosh was also seen. In a mobile video, Dolan Samanta was seen fighting with another student.“We established this sequence based on our investigation so far and have sought eyewitness accounts. We have appealed to them to come with mobile phone videos since CCTV footage is unavailable due to the damaged servers,” said DCP Tirkey.Some teachers, on being informing about the clash, intervened to check the two groups. Around 6.30pm, JNUTA held a peace meet and called on JNUSU members not to resort to violence. It was around this time that the fourth phase of the attack commenced. According to Delhi Police, masked assailants, allegedly led by ABVP members, started attacking students near the Sabarmati T-point and chased some to Sabarmati Hostel, others to Narmada Hostel. The mob vandalised the hostel rooms and attacked JNUSU members, including Ghosh.The cops disclosed that the attackers from both groups appeared to have precise information about the targets.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Organisers are urging political parties not to disrupt the cock-fight season in view of the forthcoming elections to various civic bodies.

Villagers are approaching politicians to secure police permission to hold the annual event.

Except Krishna and Guntur districts where the capital agitations are going on, the villages are ready for cock-fights. But in East and West Godavari districts organisers are yet to buy roosters but preparations are going on in coastal districts.

“Nobody can stop the cock-fights, a tradition since the days of our forefathers. If we stop, TDP will cash in on it. We are requesting the state leadership to get the government nod for the cock-fights,” said a YSRC politician in Konaseema.

An organizer in the Delta area said he the YSRC leadership would give the green signal for the traditional fights. More than 200 big and medium arenas and hundreds of small arenas are ready for the Sankranti rooster fights to be held from January 14 to January 16.

Roughly Rs 800 crore would be bet on the cock-fights, a punter said.

West Godavari district SP Navdeep Singh Grewal said they have set up two teams in each mandal with videographers. “So far 2,000 people were bound over and warned. We have taken Rs 5 lakh as bound over money from each person,” the SP said.

It is learnt that the TDP leadership has given hint that they are willing to support the events but crucial would be the decision of YSRC.

YSRC politicians feel that if there is no verbal go-ahead from the top party leadership, it would have an impact on local bodies elections.

<p>Farmers have spent as much as Rs 13,000 to Rs 15,000 for cultivation on one acre of land and up to Rs 22,00... Read More

MADURAI: The Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Sivaganga has demanded that paddy procurement centres should be inaugurated in 445 village panchayats in the district while paddy farmers in the district are getting ready for harvest after nearly five years.

Sivaganga district has been drought prone for more than four years and last year crops had failed due to drought. In previous years, farmers, who had attempted to cultivate paddy, incurred heavy losses even after cultivating the crop with the help of wells and tankers since paddy procurement centres were not established in the district.

K Veerapandi, a farmer said that paddy had been cultivated in about 70,000 hectares in Sivaganga district and harvesting had begun in places like Devakottai . “Two types of paddy, the fine grains and the bigger grains, have been cultivated and the government usually procures only the fine variety but this year they should accept both,” he said.

In the previous years, there were a lot of malpractices in the procurement centres, where those who took the centres on contract, made the farmers pay for threshing paddy though the government gave a subsidy for the same. Though the procurement is done for bags of 41 kilograms each, the people at the centres weigh a bag at 42 or 43 kilograms causing loss to farmers.

Now, farmers have been giving bags of paddy to private parties, who are taking them for cheap rates--Rs 900 per bag, while the government will pay Rs 1,700 for the same. Farmers have spent as much as Rs 13,000 to Rs 15,000 for cultivation on one acre of land and up to Rs 22,000 if they employed workers during the cultivation process.

Hence, the government should open procurement centres in all the village panchayats to help the farmers pay their dues without delay as most of them have borrowed heavily to cultivate paddy this year though there were good rains, said Kandasamy of Sivaganga.

If the centres are opened in all the villages, the procurement can be done faster and farmers will not face losses as paddy starts drying when the procurement process takes long and they lose about 10 kg per bag, said Veerapandi.

PUNE: A magisterial court here on Friday granted bail to a 22-year-old youth from Uttar Pradesh in a forgery case.

The Uttamnagar police had arrested Naveen R Tripathi, a resident of Pratapgarh in UP, on Tuesday after an investigation with the assistance from the Southern Command’s Military Intelligence unit revealed the bogus claims he made in the FIR. On Wednesday, the court ordered Naveen’s custodial remand for two days following which he was produced before the magistrate on Friday.

“The court of judicial magistrate first class T N Nirale granted bail to Naveen against a personal release bond of Rs15,000 and a surety in the like amount,” his lawyer Prasad Nikam told TOI.

The police said that Naveen allegedly forged National Defence Academy (NDA) and UPSC documents and had lodged the cheating FIR to hoodwink his parents from whom he had taken Rs1.32 lakh on the pretext of joining NDA. He had appeared for the NDA entrance exam in 2015 but could not clear it. “He told his parents that he would join the NDA soon and took Rs1.32 lakh as fees, but spent the same for shopping and partying,” said inspector Sunil Pandharkar of the Uttamnagar police. “Naveen studied the joining instructions on the NDA website and used the same to create forged documents,” Pandharkar added.

Eventually, the youth, his parents and other relatives reached the academy where Naveen produced the joining documents before the guards. The NDA authorities told Naveen and his family that the documents were fake. “Following this, Naveen lodged an FIR of cheating,” he said.

Naveen told police that three persons posing as NDA officers had interviewed him in Gujarat in 2016 after which he had received a joining letter and other forms from the academy’s e-mail IDs. The police probe revealed that he got a demand draft drawn in favour of NDA and later got the same cancelled following which the bank reverted the amount to his account.

290,['11/01/2020'],196 hotels running without NOC from SPCB get notice,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Rudrapur: The regional office of State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) at Kashipur has slapped 196 hotels, dharamshalas, and restaurants with notices for operating without its NOC. The notice directs owners of these commercial establishments to seek clearance from SPCB by March 31 or face punitive measures

""Every hotel , restaurant, and dharamshala requires clearance, according to Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. In Udham Singh Nagar district, only 22 such establishments have NOC from SPCB. Hence, we have sent notices to establishments functioning without proper clearances,"" Anurag Negi, regional officer of the SPCB, told TOI.

The SPCB move comes after the body conducted an inspection of 218 commercial establishments in the district. The official added that the businesses, which have been sent notices, didn’t even bother to apply for NOC from SPCB. “Once we receive an application for pollution clearance, a technical team visits the spot and inspects provisions to control water and air pollution,” Negi explained.

On being asked about the provisions that such commercial establishments must have to get a NOC from SPCB, Negi said, “Hotels discharge kitchen waste and sewage in large quantities. These must be treated before being released into mainstream sewerage and drainage system. Every hotel must have an incinerator to safely dispose the leftover food, which can otherwise pollute the air,"" he said.

According to the notices, if owner of such an establishment applies for NOC within the mentioned time period, he/she will get relaxation in the fee, which is charged from the day when the business was opened.

""The notice states that bona fide owners of such establishments require permission to run their business. This is their last window to get pollution clearance. If they fail, legal action would be taken against them,"" Negi said.

Meanwhile, Sudhanshu Gava, director of Hotel Sonia in Rudrapur, said, “Dual consent is among the basic criteria mandatory for establishing a hotel/restaurant. We got the NOC from SPCB as have waste recycling and sewer water treatment plants. Regulations were always there in place and it is good that the authorities are strictly implementing them now.”

NEW DELHI: A first-year student of JNU , who claimed to be affiliated to ABVP, admitted to “mobilising men from outside” and leading the attack by masked vigilantes and 20 ABVP members on teachers and students, and vandalising hostels on the evening of January 5, an undercover investigation by India Today has revealed.The student, Akshat Awasthi, said streetlights being switched off just before and during the attack was the work of “police, administration… whose police is it?” The lights were switched off, he said, as that was when “we were mobilising”.In the sting operation, Awasthi said that on Sunday he called the “organisational secretary of ABVP”, whom he named, but it was beeped out in the telecast. Following their chat, he mobilised Sunday evening’s hooliganism, he claimed.All three students interviewed in the investigation were from JNU. Awasthi is pursuing a French degree. The second, Rohit Shah, also asserting allegiance to ABVP, is in the French language course too.Awasthi also identified himself in the footage of the January 5 attack — jeans, jacket and a helmet covering his face and head. He said he could be seen rushing down the hostel corridor, smashing anything that came his way. He boasted that he mobilised the attack in retaliation to an assault allegedly by Left students on Periyar hostel earlier the same day.India Today reported Awasthi also identified both people in the most viral footage of the attack — of a girl with her face covered and the male with a sledgehammer — as fellow ABVP associates. Awasthi said that after the raid, he found a fellow ABVP member hiding. He assured her he was from ABVP, “took off the helmet, put my arm around her, and walked out as a couple”.The stick in his hand was pulled out from a flag near Periyar hostel. Asked if he hit anyone, Awasthi said, “There was a man with a flowing beard. He looked Kashmiri. I beat him and kicked down the gate.”Security guard GV Thapa told India Today that 10-15 men, in shawls with lathis, forced through Saraswatipuram Gate where he was on duty a little after 7pm on Sunday. “They threatened to beat me and went in,” he added.Shah told the undercover reporters that he lent Awasthi the helmet. “It is a must when you smash glass.” The mob came to his room too, but moved on after he told them (masked men) “it was an ABVP room.” Asked if he was proud of their actions, he said, “Of course, of course.”The third student was former JNUSU president of AISA, Geeta Kumari, who admitted to “closing the server room” to cripple the administration’s functioning. “There are no exams. None of our demands are met. He (VC Jagadesh Kumar) didn’t even meet us. Our VC does everything online, sends ‘love letter’ online, sends Happy Near Year online, sends warnings/ threats online…”Reacting to the probe, ABVP general secretary Nidhi Tripathi said, “Anyone participating in ABVP or JNUSU events cannot qualify to become members automatically. Akshat Awasthi is neither an office bearer, nor karyakarta of ABVP. Anyone involved in the violence at JNU should be prosecuted. We will fully support police in their investigation.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73197518,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112758,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sting-unmasks-hostel-attackers-all-abvps/articleshow/73196431.cms

A Delhi Metro train (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Train operations on the Yamuna Bank to Noida Electronic City section of Delhi Metro ’s busiest corridor – Blue Line – witnessed disruptions for almost the entire day after a fracture was detected on a rail.

This was the third time in three months that a ‘weld fracture’ affected train movement on the Blue Line.

The problem was first observed at 9.40am and from thereon, train services on the Noida leg of the Blue Line (Dwarka-Noida Electronic City/Vaishali) remained slow as maintenance could only be carried out after end of services at night.

“A precautionary temporary speed restriction (TSR) of 25 kmph was imposed for trains moving on Up Line (going towards Dwarka) section of Blue Line from Noida Sec-61 to Noida Sec-52 metro stations due to a weld fracture observed in this section in the morning,” a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) spokesperson said. “Due to this, services on the Noida Electronic City-Yamuna Bank section was affected since 9.40am. There was minor bunching of trains on the Down Line (towards Noida Electronic City) also as trains were being run a little slower to regulate all the trains on the line,” he said.

The corporation said that its team would take a maintenance block to carry out repairs (good weld) in the night after close of services, to avoid disturbing regular services in day time. “These welds at times get fractured due to change in temperature/weather conditions and generally happen in early morning hours. Today’s defect was also noticed in the morning and accordingly it was safely secured as per the established norms and procedures,” the spokesperson said.

He said that running trains at restricted speed is safe and as per standard practice. “All the tracks are properly maintained and inspected by maintenance teams through physical patrolling at night on a daily basis,” he said.

MK Stalin

CHENNAI/MADURAI: DMK president M K Stalin on Friday took a sarcastic route to hit out at the Centre for its decision to withdraw the 'Z+' security given to him. “I wholeheartedly thank each and every one of the @crpfindia personnel for providing security cover for me over the last many years. I urge the government to utilise CRPF personnel to protect universities and students from those perpetrating violence in the name of religion,” Stalin, who is away on a two-day visit to Andaman & Nicobar Islands, said in a tweet.

The home ministry had on Thursday withdrew Z+ security cover to him as well as deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, who however did not see any ulterior motive behind the move to withdraw security cover for Stalin. “The Union home ministry felt it was not needed and hence withdrew it. It is the same in my case too,” Panneerselvam told reporters at Chennai airport. “This also indicates that law and order is well maintained in Tamil Nadu ,” he added.

However, DMK allies MDMK and Congress slammed the Centre for the decision. While TNCC president K S Alagiri expressed doubts over the kind of security that Tamil Nadu police could provide for Stalin, Congress MP S Thirunavukkarasar urged the Centre to restore Z+ security for Stalin. Meanwhile, Tuticorin MP K Kanimozhi said that the Centre removed the security cover to prevent Stalin from functioning as a strong force against the Centre.

“Thalapathi (Stalin) has people’s protection and does not need any other protection. But those in power need protection as they are functioning against the people,” Kanimozhi said responding to questions at Tuticorin airport . She termed as eyewash the removal of Y+ cover for deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam saying it was done to avoid criticism. She said there was no surprise in the ruling party denying time for the DMK and opposition to talk against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the assembly. Kanimozhi also took part in a seminar on CAA organised by a people’s forum in Tirunelveli later in the day.

A file picture of tourist at Jantar Mantar in the city

JAIPUR: Modelled after Kerala Tourism Mart, the secret behind the southern state’s transformation as a favourite tourist destination, Rajasthan Domestic Tourism Mart (RDTM) took off to a flying start in 2018. But as the new government took over and in melee of setting new priorities and reshuffling of officials, the department lost sight of the event in 2018.

With volatility in foreign tourist visitors increasing owing to CAA and NRC protests, now the department is relooking to revive the travel mart that in its first edition had attracted 200 domestic buyers who had 7,000 pre-structured meetings with 170 sellers of tourism products from Rajasthan.

“We will make it bigger and better this year. Domestic travellers have become the new life and blood of the tourism industry, given the increasing uncertainty in foreign tourist arrivals. The department has already had a discussion with the Federation of Hospitality and Tourism of Rajasthan (FHTR). We will try to time the event before the onset of the tourist season to get maximum purchase,” said Bhanwar Lal, director, department of tourism. While the popular attractions get a boost from the business-to-business event, the focus has been on popularizing unknown destinations in the state. “Promotion and marketing play an important role in promoting unknown destinations. Rajasthan has lot of popular destinations but we want to add new ones so that we get more repeat tourists every year,” added Bhanwar Lal.

The previous edition was held at Birla auditorium but this time the organizer FHTR is planning to move the event to JECC, a much bigger venue. Similarly, plans are afoot to increase the number of buyers and sellers. “The event will be shifted to JECC as we are working on increasing the number of buyers and sellers. The three-day event is scheduled to be held in the first week of July,” said Kuldeep Chandelia, chairman of RDTM.

The mart provides a platform to the hotels, resorts, other tourism products to showcase their experiences before tour operators, travel agents and other service providers from across the country. Rajasthan hosts Great Indian Travel Bazaar every year to attract foreign tourists and with RDTM now, the state can now promote its tourism experiences for the domestic tourists as well.

KANYAKUMARI: The state police have increased the number of special police teams to 10 to intensify the hunt for the duo who shot dead special sub inspector (SSI) of police Wilson at a check post on Tamil Nadu–Kerala border on Wednesday night.

The duo having suspected terror links murdured the 57-year-old police insepector by first shooting and then stabbing him when he was alone at the check post in the night. The inspector was attached to the Kaliyakkavilai police station in Kanyakumari district .

Initially, the police formed three teams and it was later increased to five teams on Thursday.

Deputy inspector general of police (DIG) for Tirunelveli range Praveen Kumar Abhinapu said that these teams are either headed by an officer in the rank of inspector or sub inspector and are under the supervision of superintendent of police (SP) of Kanyakumari district N Shreenath.

The DIG said that officers in the rank of deputy superintendent of Police (DSP) are coordinating the combined efforts with the Kerala Police.

Two more DSPs are working on different aspects. “We know who we have to arrest. We need to know where the accused are hiding,” Praveen Kumar said.

Stating that there is not enough headway in the case, officers across ranks are tight-lipped on the case, refusing to divulge more details on the status of the case. They expressed concern that letting out any additional information would affect their efforts to close in on their suspects.

Tamil Nadu Dalit Urimaigal Pathukapu Iyakkam (rights protection movement) petitioned the government through Kanyakumari district collector to transfer the SSI murder case to the CBI.

They pressed for laying speed breakers at all 36 check posts and post armed personnel at all the check posts.

NEW DELHI: JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar on Friday announced that the university’s winter session would commence on Monday. He issued this statement immediately after his meeting with HRD secretary Amit Khare.

A series of meetings were held by HRD ministry with Kumar, JNU Students’ Union and University Grants Commission (UGC) chairperson DP Singh over the fee hike issue. The ministry officials said that the basic demand of students regarding fee hike had been agreed to by the university and an appeal was made to students to call off the agitation.

JNUSU members, led by president elect Aishe Ghosh, were told by officials that utility and service charges would be borne by UGC, as promised earlier. The ministry, however, remained non-committal on other demands of the students, including notification of the students’ union and dropping of proctorial inquiries.

Khare said, “JNU has agreed to the basic demand of students. They are requested to call off the agitation. Students won’t need to pay any utility fee or service charges, but only the increased room rent.”

A five-member team from JNU, including Kumar, registrar Pramod Kumar and three rectors, met Khare in the morning. “All decisions taken earlier about hostel fee will be implemented in totality. We have already written to UGC with estimated expenditure to release the funds. The deadline for registration will be extended, if need be. Classes will resume on January 13,” Kumar said.

Later, the ministry officials met four members of JNUSU. Ghosh said, “We are happy that the ministry has opened the dialogue. However, our demand for the VC’s resignation stands. We can’t have a dialogue with an incompetent person. We will call a meeting with counsellors and office bearers and take a call on calling off the agitation. We are waiting for the ministry’s decision to take the final call. We have also sought the ministry’s intervention in FIRs and proctorial inquiry initiated against us by the JNU administration.”

In November, the HRD ministry had formed a three-member committee to mediate between the agitating students and the JNU administration to restore normalcy in the campus. According to the formula proposed by the ministry in December, JNU would charge only the increased room rent and the service and utility charges would be borne by IGC. In return, the students would call off their agitation and engage in dialogue with the administration.

To compensate for the lost academic period, JNU was asked to extend the semester by two weeks. The university was also advised to notify the students’ union and withdraw police complaints against students.

Simhachalam temple illuminated for Vaikunta Ekadasi earlier this month

VISAKHAPATNAM: The Simhachalam temple will soon get a modern toll gate on the lines of the TTD’s Alipiri toll gate. It will replace the existing toll gate at the Simhachalam temple bus stop. The new system may have the FASTag as well.

With Visakhapatnam set to become executive capital, the temple management expects a traffic rush in the near future.

Preparations for the project have begun with widening of the ghat road from the foothill close to the Anjaneyana Swamy statue near Tholipavancha.

The temple management took the decision to ease traffic flow at the toll gate besides providing advanced security system similar to what the TTD has set up.

The Alipiri toll gate is all set to become the first non-NHAI toll plaza in the country and will promote cashless travel. The radio frequency identification-based FASTag system will involve electronic collection of toll fees instead devotees waiting in long queues.

At present, the Simhachalam temple doesn’t have any vehicle checking systems except collection of toll gate charges.

“But once the new toll gate is opened, there will be all kinds of security features. We are preparing a blueprint for the project,” said a senior temple officer.

According to sources, private contract agencies operate the existing toll gates for an annual fee of Rs 1 crore. The toll for a four-wheeler is Rs 30. Once the new system is enabled, the temple would earn more than Rs 1 crore, said the temple officer.

During special occasions such as Mukkoti Ekadasi and Chandanotsavam, there would be maximum visitors to the temple, apart from on weekends.

Executive officer of the temple, M Venkateswara Rao, said, “Yes, the toll gate project is under way. We will be able to complete it by the Chandotsavam this summer. The entire project has been handed over to donors. The temple is not spending from its funds.”

An investigation found that 11 of them were literally fake. All of the fake degrees were ‘issued by’ Meerut University,” said Mishra, adding that of the 11 defaulters, two were women and nine men.“We sent around seven to eight reminders to the Chaudhary Charan Singh University to verify the B.ed degrees of these teachers who were in our radar but the varsity didn’t pay any heed.

The official added that the teachers claimed to have completed their BEd from Meerut University between 1994 to 2005, but the university didn’t have their records.Mishra added that the education department had been informed about the matter and the SIT had advised that FIRs be lodged against these teachers by the authorities concerned.SIT believes that an interstate gang is active both in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh and is helping people get fake degrees.

Visakhapatnam: YSRC organised rallies in support of the proposed executive capital in the city on Friday.

TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu had said that there were no demands from the city for the capital, prompting the YSRC leadership to swing into action, sources said.

MLAs and constituencies’ in charges led the rallies and minister for tourism M Srinivas Rao said seven districts, including the north Andhra districts, were backward in all aspects and the capital would boost the region’s growth.

Many organisations in north Andhra have started agitations as intellectuals joined hands for Vizag while others oppose the move, saying the city would lose its peace with it becoming the capital.

Many organisations have started signature campaigns and candle rallies in support of the capital. Congress too demanded the government to announce the capital status to the city immediately.

Assembly speaker Tammineni Seetaram said: “It is a shame that TDP is against the proposal. We would fight for the capital. Naidu provokes people and is organising protests to protect his assets. It is not the people’s movement in Amaravati,” he said.

Nainital: Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Friday issued notice to the director of Tehri Dam Rehabilitation Project after a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) alleged that in a colony built for the families of those affected by the project, the land meant for public utilities such as schools and parks have been sold for plotting.

The PIL, filed by three residents of the colony that has been set up in Haridwar, has also alleged connivance of the authorities in the case and has asked for the court’s intervention.

Speaking to TOI, Sidhharth Sah, the lawyer appearing for the petitioner said that the rehabilitation site named Suman Nagar houses around 500 families and during planning certain areas were earmarked for public utilities such as schools and parks. “However, even those areas in Suman Nagar were sold for plotting. This was in clear violation of the plan and therefore several residents have approached the court,” Sah said.

The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has given the director three weeks’ time to respond to the petition. “The court has sent notices to the director of the rehabilitation project seeking his response to the petition and has now listed the case for February 11,’ Sah said.

Over 9,000 families were either fully or partially affected by the Tehri Dam project. These families have been rehabilitated at several locations across the state by the colonies developed by the government.

Extensive research often drew new perspectives and alternate stories, author Christopher C Doyle said at IIT M... Read More

CHENNAI: From the time he got his hands on a copy of Mahabharata, author Christopher C Doyle has only wondered why – why there was an epic of this scale with fantastical stories, when a far subtler spiritual text like the Bhagvad Gita was so much more in popular use; why there was a complex play of devas and asuras in the ‘Samudhra Mantan’ (churning of the ocean) when it could have well been an intense play of chemicals that led to the formation of the ‘amrit’ (nectar)?

Talking at IIT Saarang’s ‘Spotlight Lecture’ series on Friday, the fantasy writer explored answers to these questions and several more, backed by his unique style of research that intertwines science, history and archaeology with mythology .

“More than the stories, I have been fascinated with the scholarly articles and literature that connect mythologies of the world with historical studies. There’s a fair amount of evidence to show that almost in every mythology, there’s a tale that could be linked to something that actually happened,” he said.

Pointing out that he is compelled by the idea of renewing the interest of youngsters in their own culture – oral and written – Doyle said extensive research often drew new perspectives and alternate stories that could have been, “and this makes you curious,” he said. This generation has the least exposure to mythology but also a powerful hunger to know more, he said. “And they’re not going to read the Mahabharata to find answers.”

Which is why, in his books, Doyle questions events proliferated by popular mythology through the lens of science and history. “For the churning of the ocean for instance, I studied the Sanskrit meaning behind each sloka that points to a chemical process taking place inside a pot – with water, jewels, herbs and plants. In several instances in fact, you find that the word ‘samudhra’ or ocean, isn’t used at all,” he said.

Doyle pointed out that in countries like Egypt and the UK, existence and careful preservation of pre-historic evidence has made this process easier; the burial chambers in Wales for instance, whose rock structures were polished in a way that they served as parabolic mirrors and therefore astronomically aligned to tell the time of the year.

“In India unfortunately, such archeological evidence isn’t around to corroborate a lot of events. The best we can do is speculate with fiction and that is the way forward – to entertain and educate.”

Subramanian Swamy

AHMEDABAD: Calling for students’ safety on university campuses, Rajya Sabha MP from the BJP, Subramanian Swamy , said police stations must be set up on university campuses to keep students safe. Swamy spoke to the media after delivering a lecture on ‘Who are we? A quest for national identity’ at Indus University in Ahmedabad.

“Safety means assuring police presence by having police stations inside the campus. Today we have to summon the police; it takes time. Having a police station is important for university campuses in the country. This is not only for JNU, but we should start with JNU,” said Swamy.

Swamy also said that in the US, every university campus has a police station. “For JNU there shouldn’t be Delhi police alone but also a camp of BSF and CRPF.”

During his address, Swamy also took a jibe at JNU and said that the varsity should be de-constituted over time and after necessary ‘cleaning up’, it should be restarted. “JNU can never improve until it is shut down for two years. Uneducated and unqualified people were deliberately given admission there under the Congress rule. The hostel rent is Rs 10 per month and students there are as old as 35-40 years and fail every year. Students in JNU have only one aim – get a place to live in the campus in Delhi and travel across the country and participate in socialist programmes,” said Swamy.

“Majority professors there are socialists. Those who are not socialists have been stopped. After several such instances, the situation cannot be amended. A big step must be taken by closing it down for two years. Good students in JNU should be accommodated in Delhi University and Ambedkar University, among others which are nearby. The remaining must be dismissed and after necessary clean-up, it can be opened again,” he further said.

The Rajya Sabha MP also proposed changing the name of JNU. “If this seems to be tarnishing the image of JNU, the varsity’s name may also be changed and instead it can be renamed and restarted as Subhash Chandra Bose University,” he said.

Dehradun: A 45-year-old woman was mauled to death by a leopard in Rudraprayag district of Garhwal on Thursday. The woman’s family staged protests and demanded that the animal be captured immediately, after they discovered her body in the forest late in the evening. This the fourth case of death by leopard attack in Pauri in the last two months.

The victim, identified as 45-year-old Kalpeshwari Devi from Dhari Gaon, had gone to the forest to collect fodder. “The woman’s family launched a manhunt when she didn’t return after three hours. They found her slippers at the edge of the forest. When they ventured inside, they found the woman’s body,” said divisional forest officer (DFO) (Narendranagar) Dharam Singh Meena.

The DFO added that compensation had been initiated for the family and the formalities will be completed as soon as the department gets the woman’s post mortem report.

A forest department official, who did not wish to be named, said that the village where the incident took place is close to Papdasu village in Rudraprayag district, where a 55-year-old woman was killed by a leopard on December 6 last year. Since then, the forest department has deployed shooters in the area to tranquilize or kill the leopard. The team of shooters even claimed to have shot at a leopard but a body was never recovered.

The forest department has set up cages in the area to trap the animals and have also advised heads of villages to stay alert. The villagers have been asked to avoid moving about in the forest area alone. Village heads have been asked to take extra precautions when women or children go out alone.

Before the December incident, a 35-year-old woman, Sudha Devi, was killed on November 8. On November 6, a leopard killed one Madan Singh Bisht (50) of Satni village.

NEW DELHI: Braving the chill in the evening, different factions of JNU students yet again came face-to-face on Friday. However, unlike the violence that erupted on January 5, there was silence amid a heavy police presence.

While women students formed a human chain from Sabarmati T-point to the north gate of the campus holding posters and placards against the “ABVP violence”, members of ABVP and JNU Teachers’ Federation (JNUTF) and alumni conducted a silent march against “Leftist terror”.

Policemen in plainclothes made sure that there was a gap between both the groups. No slogans were raised, and there was only the sound of moving feet.

Wearing black bands over their mouths and holding black clothes — from shawls, dupattas to petticoats — the women students protested against “ABVP’s toxic masculinity.” Former JNU president Geeta Kumari, holding a poster with the poem of Hindi poet Bidrohi, said, “This protest is against ABVP and the violence it unleashed on students and teachers. We will only hold posters and remain silent.”

Calling it a march to restore academic culture in JNU, the Right-wing students, teachers and alumni marched from Sabarmati T-point to the main gate. “Locking down schools is not our idea of JNU. Research work should not be halted for petty political gains,” said an ABVP activist. They gave a call to students to register for the winter semester without any fear.

However, Karamchari Union of JNU, which was advertised to be a part of the march, clarified that they didn’t participate as an organisation. “But we are always in favour of bringing peace in the campus,” the union said.

Police said security was tightened to prevent the two groups from interacting with each other. “We formed two lines, comprising male and female policemen in civvies, who marched in between the two protesting groups. We achieved our objective of maintaining a distance between them,” said DCP (Southwest) Devender Arya.

ABVP has called for a march “against Red terror, in support of CAA” at DU Arts Faculty on Saturday.

Panaji: Health minister and Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane on Friday shot down demands of environmental activists to declare Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary a tiger reserve. He said such a move would stall development.

The minister, in whose constituency the carcasses of the four tigers were found, said the government could instead declare a tiger corridor to facilitate the movement of the big cats from Karnataka.

“We support a tiger corridor. The government must ensure that a buffer zone is left and a tiger corridor is created. A tiger reserve will impact our development. The laws governing tiger reserves are very strict. Development will get stalled. People will suffer. Those within the sanctuary are already suffering,” he said. “We are keen on protecting tigers but we must also think of the people living in the area.”

Rane was reacting to demands from environmentalists and other citizens for declaration of the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary as a tiger reserve in the wake of the death of four tigers in Sattari over four days. He criticised former Lt Governor J F R Jacob for declaring such an expansive area as part of the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. “One must apply their mind. It must be thoroughly investigated,” he said.

“No one has the right to declare a tiger reserve. It is the people’s land. A tiger corridor is necessary,” he said, adding that chief minister Pramod Sawant was competent enough to handle the matter and get to the bottom of the problem that resulted in the death of four tigers, including two cubs, in Golauli.

“The case has to be thoroughly investigated and those responsible should be taken to task,” he said.

He added that CPI, CPI(M) and AAP have been rejected in the Lok Sabha polls and “they are now using students for their vested interests”.

“Today’s police press conference established that for the past five days, the chorus that was created deliberately to blame ABVP, BJP, and others, wasn’t true. It is the Left organisations that pre-planned violence, disabled CCTV and destroyed server,” he claimed.

Irani said it was evident that a large number of students who wanted to register to pursue their scholastic goals were “prevented from doing so in order to fuel the political fires of the opposition”.

“Parties and ideas rejected by the people have tried to use students of JNU as proxies to create a perception of agitation among India’s youth. This belies the fact that there are over 900 university campuses in India, where students are peacefully pursuing academics,” she said.

HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal said he was “distressed” over the involvement of JNU students in the violence as pointed out by the Delhi Police probe. He said the ministry would not tolerate any violence and anarchy on the campus as it was committed to ensuring academic atmosphere in educational institutions.

Referring to the January 5 violence, Irani said, “ What is disturbing is the glossing of the violence perpetrated by these (Left) students, and the glorification of such behaviour as ‘dissent’.”

Without naming any party, the minister said the opposition parties don’t leave any opportunity at creating a false narrative “just before some election in some state or at the national level”. “This time around, it is assembly elections season again and it is no surprise that another bunch of seasonal saviours are being discovered alongside attempts to create a false narrative.”

BHUBANESWAR: The motive of most murders in the state in 2018 was gain (personal or financial), according to the latest findings of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Altogether 1,378 persons were murdered in 2018, while at least 832 of them were killed for some benefits or gains, the NCRB report said.

While the report has no mention of the details of such cases, police sources said most of the crimes were executed by the acquaintances of the deceased. In most cases, the motive of the murder was to acquire someone’s wealth, a senior police officer said.

The report said at least 54 persons were murdered for previous enmity (personal vendetta). Dowry was the motive of murders in 119 cases and love affairs in 38 cases.

The NCRB data showed marginal increase in the total number of suicides in the state. While 4,493 persons committed suicide in the state in 2017, the figure went up to 4,592 in 2018. Family problems drove at least 1,460 persons to end their lives in 2018. The report said at least 40 persons committed suicide owing to financial bankruptcy, about 230 for marriage-related issues and 114 owing to failure in examinations.

321,['11/01/2020'],"Natural gas supply project in Haridwar to be completed by Dec 2020, say officials","This story is from January 11, 2020

Haridwar: A five-year project to supply natural gas for cooking purposes in Haridwar will be completed by December this year, according to officials.

Work on the Rs 200 crore-project to reach around 1,000 households has already started. It was initiated in 2016. Notably, Haridwar is among the four districts of Uttarakhand – others namely, Dehradun , Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar - where work is currently in progress under the Central government project. The Haridwar project covers Laksar and Roorkee towns as well.

The project aims at supplying natural gas through a gas pipeline. It is a joint venture of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Gail Gas, the latter’s project manager Paranjai Joshi told TOI on Thursday.

Initially, the project faced hurdles in laying down a pipeline due to the city’s river-bed strata with boulders, thereby making digging of pits rather difficult. Another problem arose as BHEL refused to provide gas and it had to be taken from Jwalapur. This involved the pipeline crossing the Ganga canal.

“Overcoming initial hiccups like these, we succeeded in laying 700 inch km line out of total 850 inch km by December 2019. We are confident that the project will be over well before the start of the Kumbh 2021 in Haridwar,” Joshi added.

Though the total households initially included in the project are 17,000, the number is likely to go up. Similarly, the cost of the project will also increase as it is reviewed, he also said.

As compared to LPG, natural gas has many advantages. It is cheaper and more convenient to use. Being lighter than air, natural gas in case of leakage goes up and dissolves in the atmosphere unlike LPG which sinks.

However, while using it, the same precaution has to be taken as is done in using LPG, because this is potentially dangerous, Joshi explained. The major work in the project has been to lay steel pipes of greater diameter in streets. For lanes, ancillary pipes of lesser diameter are used. Connections to domestic households and small commercial establishments are different from those given to industrial units, Joshi added.

Once the project is completed, registration will begin for consumer connection across Haridwar. For this, registration fee of Rs 300 and refundable security of Rs 5,500 will be charged.

Vasco: Congress has threatened to protest outside the Mormugao police station if the police fail to register complaints lodged against urban development minister and local MLA Milind Naik by Monday.

GPCC general secretary Sankalp Amonkar said, “Naik is indulging in dictatorship, and the Mormugao police are supporting him. He has been wielding his power and taking revenge against people with the help of police.”

Several days ago, an argument had taken place between Naik and a local, Suraj Chodankar, over obtaining permission to cut down an old tree. A scuffle had ensued during which Naik was allegedly pushed down by Chodankar, and a complaint was filed against the latter.

However, the counter-complaint filed by Chodankar against Naik has not been registered by Mormugao police. Two other complaints were also filed against Naik, which have not been registered.

Amonkar warned of an agitation if the complaints were not registered.

AHMEDABAD: The Regional Passport Office, Ahmedabad, in 2019, was able to dispatch tatkal passports on the day of application itself, while the average time to dispatch a normal passport was 7.5 days.

Passport office staff said the RPO Ahmedabad had in 2019 issued 6.93 lakh passports, which was more than the passports issued in 2018. The officials said that on an average 2,400 passports were printed every day. The Centre has simplified the police verification process, where police now only report criminal antecedents and citizenship of the applicant.

This resulted in 28% drop in the number of adverse police verification reports and the average time taken for police verification improved by a day from the earlier 11 days it took. According to Sonia Yadav, regional passport officer, Ahmedabad, the RPO Ahmedabad had four new Passport Seva Kendras — two at Ahmedabad and one each at Vadodara and Rajkot, where daily 2,500 appointments were given to passport applicants.

The Ahmedabad RPO covers 22 Lok Sabha constituencies, while the remaining four LS constituencies in the state come under the Surat RPO. The officials said that with two Passport Seva Kendras opened at post offices in Chota Udepur and Godhra all the 26 Lok Sabha constituencies were covered.

RPO officials said that in 12 Passport Seva Kendras, including some at post offices, appointments were given within the next day, while in 17 Passport Seva Kendras at post offices, appointments were given within 5 working days. In 2019, in six Passport Adalats, 4,000 files were cleared. Another Passport Adalat is being held this month where 2,000 applicants have been called.

Shashi Tharoor

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress functionary Shashi Tharoor on Friday accused Arvind Kejriwal of not taking a “clear stand” on the Citizenship Amendment Act as he felt the CM wanted both supporters and opponents of the new law by his side in the upcoming polls.

At a press conference, Tharoor said: “On what basis should people vote for him (Kejriwal) if he cannot speak on the issue...I don’t know whose orders he is receiving. Who has asked you not to speak about violence against your students, not meet the injured students, and not take a clear stand on CAA? You are the CM and there is nobody to order you (sic).”

Tharoor cited an old tweet of Kejriwal against then chief minister Sheila Dikshit claiming that people would not vote for a “helpless” CM. “He (Kejriwal) tweeted this years ago — we do not want such a helpless CM. Let him read his own tweet now. Do parents want such a helpless CM who, when their children are facing lathis, does not meet them?” Tharoor asked.

AAP did not react to Tharoor’s comments. Sanjay Singh had earlier said that had Kejriwal gone to JNU, BJP would have vitiated the atmosphere there and blamed it on him.

Tharoor also attacked BJP. “Definitely, the intention of BJP before almost every election is to create polarisation. We hope the educated voters of Delhi resist any such move,” he said.

Leader of Opposition in assembly Vijender Gupta said it was Congress and AAP that tried to polarise voters by “misleading” the minorities. “They (Congress) started connecting CAA and NRC and misled people... There is violence in selective areas and universities and a deliberate attempt to target BJP,” he said.

PANAJI: For a state that promotes tourism , Goa’s crime statistics relating to foreigners is nothing to be proud about. The state ranks fourth in crimes against and by foreigners, according to National Crime Record Bureau ( NCRB ) data.

Goa recorded 34 cases of crime against foreigners in 2018 with Maharashtra topping the list with 63 cases, followed by Uttar Pradesh (62) and Tamil Nadu (51).

Data shows 138 cases of crime committed by foreigners have been registered across the state in 2018. West Bengal recorded 744 cases, followed by Karnataka (175) and Himachal Pradesh (147).

‘Crime in India’, an annual release of the Union home ministry’s NCRB, has collected, collated and published statistics of crimes committed against foreigners and by foreigners in India.

Not a single crime has been committed by foreigners in Jharkhand, Nagaland and Odisha.

A senior police officer said that Goa receives a large number of foreign tourists and that is the reason the number of crimes is reported against them and crime committed by them is high compare to the many other states.

Among those arrested over a period are nationals of Iran, UK, Israel, Kenya, Russia, Ghana, Tanzania, Germany, Nigeria, Sweden, Uganda, Nepal, Georgia, Italy, Czech Republic, Romania, Afghanistan, French, Jordan, Austrian, Turkey, South Africa, South Korea, Uzbekistan, Yemen and Ivory Coast.

While Nigerians are mostly involved in narcotic cases, Romanians are involved in ATM frauds and Tanzanians are primarily booked for overstaying and not having valid travel documents, police said. Russians too were found to be involved in drug cases.

Cases in which foreigners have been booked or arrested include attempt to murder, rape, rioting, assault on public servant, cheating, under Foreigners Act, immoral trafficking, possession and peddling of narcotics and theft among other violations.

NCRB said that 55 cases of human trafficking have been reported in the state. The purpose of human trafficking in Goa is for sexual exploitation or prostitution. In 2018, Goa police filed 69 chargesheets in human trafficking cases.

KERI: The two-member central government committee that has been appointed to probe the successive deaths of four tigers in Goa, has reprimanded the state’s forest officials for not having demarcated the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary area where the deaths are suspected to have taken place due to man-animal conflict.

The committee, comprising Rajendra Garawad and Ayya Mallya, arrived in the state on Friday and visited the Golauli forest in Sattari — which is part of the wildlife sanctuary and where the carcasses were found — to carry out investigations. Both members told state forest officials that as the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary was declared in 1999, steps to demarcate its boundaries should be taken immediately.

Garawad and Mallya, who were accompanied by state deputy conservator of forests (wildlife division) Vikas Desai, will be in Goa for four days and will submit their findings in the death of the four tigers to the Union environment ministry.

Meanwhile, Goa forest officials took a fourth accused, Jyotiba Pavane, in their custody for the tiger killings. Interrogation of all four suspects is on, they said.

Forest department officials have called the deaths a case of ‘revenge killing’, after a cow and a buffalo of the forest dwellers were preyed on by the tigers. They said that the villagers, enraged due to loss of livelihood, poisoned a buffalo kill. When the tigers returned to feed on the buffalo, it led to their deaths.

Two of the earlier accused, Vithu Pavane and Malo Pavane, told forest officials that the tigers were killed due to poisoning of the buffalo and have confessed to burying two of the big cats. The accused have, however, not yet disclosed who was responsible for the poisoning, forest officials said.

On Friday, all four accused were produced before the Valpoi JMFC and remanded in seven days custody. Nandkumar Parab and other officials of forest department are investigating the case.

GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat assembly on Friday passed a resolution supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) with a majority, even as there was an uproar in the assembly after a Congress MLA opposed the act with a banner written with his own blood.

Pradipsinh Jadeja, minister of state, home, law and legislative affairs, moved the resolution to support the CAA. Jadeja’s resolution was supported by CM Vijay Rupani and all BJP MLAs, while the leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani and all Congress MLAs opposed the resolution.

Repeating what CM Vijay Rupani has said earlier, Jadeja said, “There are 150 countries for Muslims, but India is the only country for Hindus. The CAA is for protecting the rights of Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Jains and Buddhists in the three neighbouring Islamic countries of Pakistan , Bangladesh and Afghanistan .” He also alleged that the Congress is spreading misconceptions about the legislation.

Paresh Dhanani, leader of opposition in the state assembly, said, “The CAA along with the NRC, have created panic among poor Indian Muslims and even among those from scheduled castes and tribes, as many from these communities still do not have any identity papers. The BJP is trying to divert the public’s attention from unemployment, rising prices and other serious issues.”

Meanwhile, Rupani, reacting to independent MLA Jignesh Mevani ’s allegations about the CM’s Burmese origins, said that his father and mother had Indian passports and he was born in India and has an Indian passport.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Dalita Hakkula Porata Smithi (DHPS) slammed the state government for using funds of corporations for financing Amma Vodi during a table conference held here on Friday.

J V Prabhakar, president, DHPS, said the government had diverted Rs 6,108 crore out of Rs 6,456 crore grant for various corporations.

He said it was unfortunate the government which should protect the weaker sections was diverting funds for their upliftment. “Lack of funds is not an excuse to divert funds from corporations which are supposed to finance scholarship, self-employment and related activities for the benefit of the financially and socially weaker sections of society,” Prabhakar said.

Prabahakar said the government was delaying payment of scholarships, mess bills and other welfare schemes along with salaries for those employed on contract, while on the other hand it was diverting funds.

He said the government must try to raise funds from other sources. Members of Aikya Vedika urged all communities to condemn the diversion of corporation funds.

Members of caste organisations attended the conference .

Another person, identified as Saurabh, too has been made a co-accused in the case.

Ganeshpeth police squad, under PI SS Kumare, arrested Mendke and Bhaisware on January 7. The two have been remanded to custody till January 13.

Police said Majan, who also has offences registered against him at Dhantoli and Ajni police stations, is the mastermind of the racket that has duped not only the job aspirants on the pretext of giving them employment as clerks at Auditor General (AG) office but many others including loan seekers and also a couple who had financed their film.

Ganeshpeth police, which busted the gang, also received complaints from two more persons including one from whom the gang had taken Rs 6 lakh to finance their films promising to return Rs 10 lakh after the release but did not fulfill their promise.

In the latest case, Majan and others had taken substantial amount promising Anil Nagpure and his brother Sunil jobs at AG office in 2017. The money was taken from father of the brothers who is complainant in the case. He stated Majan had conducted fake selection examination and interview of Anil Nagpure and his brother Sunil at Income tax office in Mumbai. They had also pasted a fake list of the successful candidates outside the office of the Income Tax in which the names of the Nagpure brothers were mentioned.

The racketeers later issued appointment letters to Anil and Sunil on different dates mentioning their posting as clerks at AG office. Police said Majan and his gang were deferring the date of joining for more than one year which created doubt regarding their motive as Anil and Sunil had started pressuring them. The Nagpures were also abused and threatened by the gang that had pretended to return their money through cheques that bounced.

The Nagpures had tried to approach crime branch which ignored their complaint. So they wrote to the city police chief BK Upadhyay following which an offence was registered at Ganeshpeth police station where a squad comprising constable Nitin Mishra, Virendra Karade, Nishikant Meshram, Sachin Aswar and others was formed to probe the case.

It is learnt Majan and accomplices had opened an office at Dhantoli around a year ago. They had met Nagpure brothers, whose family members had arranged the cash after selling properties, near Ganeshpeth bus stop.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police will probe into some posters put up on lampposts outside the JNU campus on Thursday night allegedly by a fringe Hindu group seeking “azadi” from the Left. Every poster has been signed by one Surjeet Yadav, who claims to be a Hindu Sena member.

The probe will find out how the posters appeared on Baba Gangnath Marg ahead of the barricades despite the round-the-clock presence of a police team on the road, a source said.

Claiming responsibility for the act, Vishnu Gupta, president of Hindu Sena, said the posters were put up for public information. “Many students sympathise with Naxalites and anti-national activities. So in the name of protests over fee hikes, they are obstructing education of other fellow students,” he alleged. The slogans include “Hume Chahiye Azadi”, often used by JNU protesters, and “Desh ke Dushmano se Azadi, Maoists, Terrorists se Azadi”. Police may call Yadav for questioning.

JNU students said the banners had further “vitiated the atmosphere”. Another fringe group, Hindu Raksha Dal, had already claimed responsibility for the January 5 attack on students on the JNU campus.

PANAJI: Four years after receiving a grant from the Centre’s department of biotechnology to work on repurposing an anti-malarial drug for the possible treatment of lung cancer, Angshuman Sarkar, an assistant professor at BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa campus, has successfully demonstrated how it kills lung cancer cells in humans.Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 80% of all lung cancer cases diagnosed, is notoriously tough to treat because of its resistance to drugs. Once the drug based on Sarkar's research is made available in the market, it is set to achieve two remarkable objectives—make treatment significantly more affordable and increase the lifespan of patients.The repurposed drug is based on Quinacrine (QC), a well-known anti-malarial medication.“Two of the major challenges for the treatment of lung cancer are chemo resistance and metastasis (spreading of cancer in other parts of body). NSCLC amongst all other types are much more prone to acquire resistance despite the variety and combination of drugs being used,” said Sarkar, who works at the institute’s department of biological sciences, and received his post-doctoral training at the Cleveland Clinic’s cancer biology department.“Almost all patients who receive treatment acquire resistance after cycles of treatment given to them,” said Sarkar, whose research has also been accepted for publication in ‘Oncotarget’, one of the world’s top oncology journals.NSCLC is sub-categorised into carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma account for most lung cancer cases diagnosed in India.Sarkar said scientists have begun to repurpose old and clinical drugs used for other treatment towards cancer cure due to the extremely high cost of even a single cycle of innovative therapies.“Worldwide, a lot of emphasis has been placed on discovering bioactive compounds which have potential effects on cancer progression, metastatic spread as well as overcoming the chemo resistant adaptation by cancer cells,” Sarkar told TOI.“Quinacrine is one such synthetic bioactive compound, popularly known as anti-malarial drug.

The millennial voters, who would be voting in a civic election for the first time, are taking their democratic rights seriously and focusing on issues that would be the determining factors in the polls

VISAKHAPATNAM: As officials gear up to conduct civic polls in the city after a gap of seven years, the millennial voters, who would be voting in a civic election for the first time, are taking their democratic rights seriously and focusing on issues that would be the determining factors in the polls.“I want a neat, clean and pollution-free environment. Often I have seen garbage pile up in my neighbourhood. I want the civic body to focus on state-of-the art waste disposal management and keep my locality neat and clean,” 22-year-old M Pushpa, who stays in Madhurawada area of the city, says.Pushpa, who got her name registered in the electoral rolls just before the 2019 general elections, cast her vote for the first time on April 11 last year, when simultaneous polls were held for the Lok Sabha and AP assembly. Of the around 10 lakh new voters added to the electoral rolls in AP in 2019, close to 5,000 are from the city and would cast their vote in a civic election for the first time.Pushpa’s neighbour, 21-year-old K Ravi Prasad, wants the GVMC to create more sporting infrastructure in the city and save the remaining few sports grounds. He claimed that over the last few years around three grounds were turned into residential localities.“There is hardly any ground left in my locality where we can enjoy a game of cricket or football. Around 5-6 years back we used to have at least four grounds in our locality where we used to play tennis ball cricket. Today, only two grounds are left and you would see multiple matches taking place at the same time. I don’t want these two remaining grounds to vanish too. The civic body should ensure there’s at least one ground in every locality,” added Prasad.Most youths in the city also want GVMC to build dedicated hangout zones with parking lots where they can spend their evenings with friends. “If Visakhapatnam becomes the executive capital there are apprehensions that the city would become congested. The civic body must ensure that there are enough open spaces and parks in the city. And importantly, it must ensure there are proper parking lots at those places,” suggests K Ramesh, a 22-year-old student who is pursuing his MBA.The youngsters are also concerned about the environment. They want the city to remain free from pollution, as it is now, after it becomes the capital. “If Vizag becomes the executive capital, the civic body has a huge responsibility to keep pollution levels under check. The civic bosses must ensure that development does not come at the cost of polluting the environment. My city should remain as beautiful as it is today,” demanded 24-year-old C Suresh Raju, an engineering student.",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73198254,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-595550,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/first-time-voters-share-wish-list-ahead-of-polls/articleshow/73195746.cms

Mazhar Asif

NEW DELHI: A section of Jawaharlal Nehru University students has accused a few teachers of being a part of the recent violent attacks on the students on campus. The students have also put up posters near the hostels and in front of the central library with their names and pictures, alleging that they are “traitors of JNU” and “architects of violence.”

Students had earlier raised objections to the appointment of associate dean, School of Language, Mazhar Asif as a member of an investigation committee set up by the vice-chancellor, alleging that “he was one of the attackers.” The JNU administration had formed the committee on January 7 to inquire into the incidents of violence on January 5.

Students also alleged that Asif was a former member of the ABVP and led an attack on students on January 4. Several posters questioned his presence in the inquiry committee.

Asif, however, refuted the allegations and said that the charges were “baseless.” He added: “I vehemently condemn these. They are all my students and if anyone is attacked I am deeply hurt about that. We don’t discriminate among our students.”

The associate dean stated that the inquiry committee will soon come out with its report on the violence.

JNUSU vice-president Saket Moon alleged that the “committee was biased as Asif was one of the teachers who led the charge against the students on January 4.” Satish Chandra Yadav, JNUSU general secretary, claimed that “Asif was also present when there was violence near the School of Biotechnology.”

Four others, whose pictures were pasted together in different posters on campus, include Tapan Bihari of Centre for Political Studies (CPS); Prakash Chandra Sahoo, warden of Sabarmati Hostel; Abhinav Prakash, assistant professor in Delhi University; and Dhananjay Singh, JNU chief proctor.

Responding to the posters, chief proctor Dhananjay Mahapatra said that he will “file a complaint as it is a design to malign the chief proctor. We are going to take this very seriously. Since I have been a student of this university and teacher for more than 12 years, I have built up a reputation and I am yet to recover from this dismay, ever since I have seen it.”

Tapan Bihari refused to comment on the posters, stating that the registrar’s office will respond on this. Abhinav Prakash stated: “I don’t know why I have been named in the poster. It could be because I have been a critic of the left. There used to be a more mature left in the campus when I was there. Now, there is anarchy.”

BENGALURU: Six hours after a speeding motorcycle hit a stone on Nelamangala-Sondekoppa Road on Wednesday midnight, the pillion rider regained consciousness only to find his rider-friend lying dead next to him.

Nelamangala Rural police said Chandrashekar N, 24, of Seegehalli, regained consciousness after a passerby woke him up. Before things could dawn on Chandrashekar, he saw his friend, Punitha KC, 23, a resident of Seegehalli, off Magadi Road and from Kadarahalli near Hassan, lying dead in a pool of blood next to him.

Punitha and Chandrashekar worked in a private factory in Nelamangala and shared an accommodation in Seegehalli with another colleague, Siddanna.

Police said, “Punitha and Chandrashekar went from their workplace to Kunigal Cross to drop Siddanna so that he could to catch a bus to Hassan at 11pm. Later, the duo was riding back home when Punitha lost control of the bike and hit a stone near Mantanakurchi village gate. Both were thrown on to the road. As Nelamangala-Sondekoppa Road sees very poor traffic at night, the accident was not noticed by anyone.”

Chandrashekar told police that he felt numb with pain and fell unconsciousness soon after the accident. “But before that I could realise that Puneetha too had sustained severe injuries. I gained consciousness only around 6.30am when a passerby woke me up. I had sustained injuries on my right shoulder, right leg and near the right eye. I found Punitha dead next to the bike,” he stated in the complaint.

Chandrashekar has been admitted to a private hospital. Nelamangala Rural police handed over Punitha’s body to his kin on Thursday after autopsy at a government hospital.

Family members of Shweta

JAIPUR: We were certain that Rohit got my sister killed, said Shweta Tiwari ’s brother after cops arrested her husband for the murders.

Her family told TOI that she had suspected him of having an affair but they asked her not to doubt him to that extent. Although the cops found no evidence of an extramarital affair, the arrested husband did admit that he wanted to remarry.

Shweta’s brother Shubham Mishra, while speaking to TOI, said, “We never had any doubt that he killed my sister and nephew as he had been physically violent with her on many occasions. He had also threatened to kill her just two days before the murder .”

The family also claimed that despite fulfilling Rohit’s demands of dowry at the time when the couple got married, the demand kept increasing and Mishra added, “Even before Shweta and Rohit got married, his family created an issue over the wedding venue as they wanted us to organise it in Delhi in a lavish manner. After the marriage also Rohit kept asking my sister for the money from the fixed deposits made by my father.”

Regretting not taking his sister’s claims of Rohit having an affair, Mishra said that they had not realised that it could be actually true. Rohit had been a relationship in 2007 before he got married to Shweta and police officials said that although he did say that he wanted to start a new life with someone else, they are uncertain if it was with the same woman who he had been dating previously.

Her family also created a Facebook page called ‘Justice for Shreyam and Shweta’ in which they have asked for capital punishment for the accused.

Visakhapatnam: With the dates for the civic polls likely to be announced soon, the ruling YSRC has focused its attention on winning the GVMC elections. The port city is considered a TDP stronghold, and a win in the civic polls here would give a big boost to the ruling party which has been waiting for long to grab power in GVMC.

Though there are not many strong local leaders in the party, the YSRC is banking on the various welfare schemes of the government and the charisma of chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy to clinch things in its favour. The city, with a population of 19 lakh, is spread over 650 square kilometres. It became Greater Vizag in 2005 after the merger of Gajuwaka municipality and 32 peripheral areas.

Anakapalli and Bheemili municipalities were merged into Greater Visakha five years ago. Five panchayats on the outskirts of the city — Kapuluppada, Anandapuram, Nidigattu, Chepaluppada and JV Agraharam — too were merged with GVMC a few days back.

Vizag MP M V V Satyanarayana exuded confidence that the party will win the civic polls due to the good work of the government. “Not just Vizag, people across the state are in favour of YSRC. The chief minister thinks about the welfare of all sections of the society in his mind,” he told TOI.

According to YSRC sources, Jagan himself is keen to win the Vizag municipal elections area.

Porvorim: Transport minister Mauvin Godinho on Friday ruled out any extension of the 50% road tax cut on four-wheelers and two-wheelers and said that it was for automobile dealers to now announce discounts and incentives to clear their inventory ahead of the BSVI rollout.

The minister told reporters that if the state government had not announced the road tax cut, several automobile dealers would have had to shut down due to losses and huge inventory.

“If you see, the GST collections did not go down. The road tax would not have been even half of what we collected in that period,” Godinho said.

The minister said cut in road tax had also helped push sales of vehicles which had otherwise slumped due to the decline in the country’s economic situation.

“Dealers would have had to close down like it happened in Maharashtra and other places,” Godinho said.

Members of the Goa Automobile Dealers Association (GADA) met chief minister Pramod Sawant and Godinho with a request for the 50% cut in road tax to be extended up to March 31.

JAIPUR: The CCTV camera footage of Rohit Tiwari ’s neighbour helped police crack the sensational twin murder case. After tracing the owner and seeking permission, cops broke into the neighbour’s house which was lying vacant for nearly a year. They found the footage which clearly showed the hired killer taking the dead baby out of the apartment.An official who was part of the investigation, on condition of anonymity told TOI, “We saw that the flat next to Rohit’s had a CCTV camera but the apartment was vacant for last one year. We got in touch with the owner and told him that we needed access to the footage. After he gave permission, we broke into the house. The footage gave us the strongest evidence.It showed that when Saurabh entered Rohit’s flat, his face was semi-covered but when he was leaving it with the baby’s body, the hired killer’s face was clearly visible.”According to the original murder plan, Chaudhary was supposed to bury the child’s body in some secluded location where it could never be found but in a moment of panic, he dumped it over the boundary wall of the residential complex. He was planned on coming back later to dispose of the body but by that time heavy police presence was already in the area, claimed cops.The case was a challenge to solve as there were no leads and the prime suspect, Rohit Tiwari was well prepared for interrogation as he had predicted his own arrest. ‘Cool and composed’, Tiwari was a tough nut to crack in the murder investigation, who neither shed a tear or even asked to go for his wife and son’s funeral, said cops.“In the three days since the murder of his wife and son, Rohit has not shed a single tear. We would have allowed him to go for their funeral also but he never sought permission.

341,['11/01/2020'],Delhi: Shaheen Bagh juniors draw attention to CAA,"This story is from January 11, 2020

The children have made new friends and found new hobbies over the last few weeks

NEW DELHI: Australia’s raging wildfires , actor Deepika Padukone’s portraits , Spiderman and Disney’s princesses: these were the subjects of painting for the many children of Shaheen Bagh on Thursday. The kids, aged between 5 and 15, have been accompanying their mothers as they sit under a canopy on Kalindi Kunj road in south-east Delhi to protest against the new citizenship law.

The nearly half-a-kilometre stretch they occupy is blockaded by police at both ends, but the yellow barricades also bear signs of their protests. “No to NRC, no to CAA” have been spray-painted across the barricades in bold letters. Bedsheets have been painted with images of resistance and words from the Preamble and the tricolor are hoisted at several places.

The women’s fight against CAA started on December 16, a day after Jamia Milia Islamia students were attacked by Delhi police. They came out of their homes, shaken by the images of violence, determined that they would sit on a “dharna” until CAA was repealed. But the women did not occupy the road alone. Along with them came their children — infants, toddlers, pre-adolescents and teens.

In the initial days, the children sat with the mothers, unsure of the “civil disobedience movement” that had brought the neighbourhood to national limelight. But as days passed, the toddlers began to venture further away from their mothers’ laps, and the teens began to ask questions about what the law meant.

When TOI visited the neighbourhood, many children sat in a group, independent of their mothers. Most of them had the tricolor painted on both their cheeks, and they listened intently to the speakers on stage. They carried posters against CAA and lent their voices to Inquilab slogans. Some even took charge of the mike and chanted “Hum kagaz nahin dikhayenge”.

The children have made new friends and found new hobbies over the last few weeks, especially after Usama, a young Jamia research scholar set up a makeshift library opposite the protest site. Today, he is both a companion and teacher to these kids.

“I came here a week ago with a hundred books. But within two days, we expanded our collection because more people donated their books. The volunteers here also crowdsourced stationery and A4 drawing sheets for children,” Usama told TOI.

Siblings Alina, 9, and Aliza, 6, have been visiting the library daily. So has Deepika. The three have become best friends now. The library volunteers encourage them to draw and give them a theme every day. The best paintings are then displayed in the “open exhibition” space, said another volunteer Younus, who also conducts art workshops for the children. Younus is a graduate student in Jamia’s fine arts department.

The paintings on display depict the students’ limitless imagination. There were paintings depicting the Australian wildfires with the message, Shaheen Bagh prays for Australia. It was drawn by Class IV student Ishtiyaq Nabi. There also are paintings thanking Deepika Padukone for her solidarity with JNU and slogans against CAA. But most common are self-portraits of students holding the national flag.

Surekha, one of the volunteers who donated the art material and books to the library, said: “The idea was to give the children and other protesters breathing space. This space gives them a chance to pause, read and think.”

The students get their ideas from storytelling sessions held at the library. On Wednesday, artiste Himanshu Bajpai, who made a cameo appearance in Sacred Games 2, held a session for them. But the children have other sources of inspiration too. As Hasan, a nine-year-old said, they draw their tales from the grandmothers who sit on the stage at the dharna. The two women — 82-year-old Bilkis Begum and 80-year-old Noor-un-Nisa — are an endless source of stories for the children. The women, who have lived through the Freedom Struggle, instill ideas of “secularism and unity” in them.

“This is another fight for freedom. We cannot be mere witnesses while the country’s Constitution is under attack. We are here to defend the idea of this nation. Why should we prove that we our grandfathers were born here?” asked Bilkis.

Another face of the resistance is 50-year-old Mehrun Nisa, who is on a hunger strike for nine days. A resident of Wazirabad, she quit her job at Jama Masjid canteen and came to Shaheen Bagh. The women say their fight is for all the children of this country. “The children are fighting for India, and we are fighting for them. There would be no future without them,” said Mehrun.

Representative image

NAGPUR: Yash Mishra (8), a STD III student, was killed after coming under the left rear wheels of his school bus at Daulat Patel Chowk in Bajeriya on Friday. He had alighted from the vehicle near his residence at Telipura.

The bus did not have a conductor, which is a violation of the directives issued by the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court following a similar incident in 2012.

Yash, the only son of his parents Mewalal and Shraddha, was a student of Orange City High School at Gaddigodam. Sources said that Yash and another student got down from the bus which has a folding gate. Yash attempted to cross the road moving in front of the bus which mowed him down.

The driver of the bus, Praful Mathure, now in custody of Ganeshpeth police, failed to spot Yash.

Onlookers rushed a seriously injured Yash to Mayo Hospital where he died during treatment. Ganeshpeth police took Mathure into custody from the hospital and also have also seized the bus.

Sources said that Mathure’s wife used to be the conductor but had discontinued a few days ago to take care of their 3-year-old daughter. Yash used to go to school in an auto and return by the bus. The vehicle picked up students from other schools too.

Mewalal said he would pay Rs700 per month for the bus service. “My son returned safely every day. I did not expect this to happen,” said Mewalal who works at a railway station eatery. Shraddha was at home with her daughter Pihu when the incident took place.

Social worker Nutan Rewatkar said the management of the school must be booked in the case.

The school principal Sharda Naidu tried to distance her institution and it’s management from ownership of the bus. But the police have kept the option open to book them in the incident for negligence as per the Motor Vehicles Act, 1989 and Rules 2011.

Naidu said they have nothing to do with the operation and management of the bus. “The bus was being operated by the driver and he had given us in writing that the sole responsibility of the safety and security of the children was his,” she said. “We just gave him permission to use our school’s name on the vehicle,” said another school staffer.

A senior police official said the driver had the names of students from Orange City High School who would use the bus service.

Senior PI SS Kumare of Ganeshpeth police station said the school management’s neglect in ensuring safety of the students is being scrutinized. “The RTO would be also summoned to examine the vehicle,” he said.

Police have invoked section 304 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

The incident was reminiscent of the incident in 2012 when nine-year-old Virat Zade died after being crushed under the wheels of his school bus after alighting.

The Nagpur bench of Bombay HC had taken suo motu cognisance of the matter reported in the media. It passed strict directives to follow the Maharashtra Motor Vehicles (Regulations for School Buses), Rules 2011, irrespective of whether the schools own their buses or run contracted services.

Even the state education department had issued circulars to all the schools to ensure the buses were operated with conductors and had CCTV cameras.

343,['11/01/2020'],"Tadoba’s Kolsa relocation to come at cost of 30k trees, 15k bamboo clusters","This story is from January 11, 2020

The villagers have identified this road-touch forest land

Nagpur: This is a classic case of ‘robbing Peter to pay back Paul’.

The Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) plans to relocate Kolsa village inside the reserve to Chichpalli range in the tiger corridor between Tadoba-Kanhalgaon-Kawal.

But it is an irony of conservation that to create inviolate space for tigers, the relocation will come at the cost of 30,000 teak and other tree species and over 15,000 bamboo clusters running into over 25 crore.

Compartment number 522 is spread over 380 hectares of which TATR plans to settle over 100 families in 280 hectares. The reserve forest is in possession of Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM), which is into commercial extraction of timber.

Kolsa villagers have identified this road-touch forest land which has presence of tigers and other wild animals. The dense forest, 3.5km from Mul city, also connects buffer zone of Kolsa range of TATR.

At a time when dense forest cover in the state has gone down by 95 sq km as per the latest FSI-2019 report, there is simmering anger among greens against such a move.

“Wildlife officials may argue that FDCM is into commercial extraction of timber and hence, tree felling should not be an issue. But the high-quality forest is home to many wild animals and is a functional corridor. We will oppose it tooth and nail,” said Green Planet Society chief Suresh Chopne.

TATR field director NR Praveen said the land has been identified by the villagers and accordingly, FDCM has been asked to enumerate trees and assets on the said land. “However, the proposal is in its initial stage and has not been sent to MoEFCC for approval,” he added.

In 2007, 128 families including all 79 from Botezari and 49 of 146 from Kolsa were relocated at Bhagwanpur in Mul as per the Rs1 lakh package then. Of the remaining 97 families from Kolsa, 16 voluntarily accepted Option-I (golden handshake policy by taking Rs10 lakh) and nine were relocated at Bhagwanpur in 2013.

The remaining families were reluctant to move out and now want dense forest land in Chichpalli range. During the last 5 years, the families have almost doubled but TATR officials said only those will benefit who were in the final list of the cut-off date in 2014.

As per the relocation package announced by NTCA, each member above 18 years and widows too are termed as one family and are entitled to get a package of Rs10 lakh.

FDCM divisional manager Vivek More, West Chanda, confirmed that TATR has demanded the said land and sought report on the number of trees, bamboo clusters and other assets on forest land.

“We are at work and in 8 days, a report will be submitted after doing valuation. Being close to TATR, the area has rich wildlife,” More added.

Bandu Dhotre, also a member of the committee on relocation of TATR villages, opposed the move. “I feel the relocation package needs to be enhanced. There should be a condition that unless PAPs procure alternative farm land, the money should not be released,” he said.

After large-scale felling of forest areas to relocate villages like Botezari, Palsagaon, Jamni and Navegaon from TATR, it was decided not to resettle people on forest land and encourage them to go for Option-1.

As reported by TOI on December 13, 2012, to relocate two Tadoba villages — Jamni and Navegaon (Ramdegi) at Khadsangi — the forest department felled 1.4 lakh trees.

“We can’t afford to lose forests anymore, especially in the backdrop of increasing tiger population in the state and flared up man-animal conflict in Chandrapur district. I fully agree that relocation is a must but it should be voluntarily with Option-I package or on scrub forests or zudpi lands,” said Chopne.

“The decision of Kolsa villagers is not binding. Earlier, relocation of Rantalodi in Tadoba was delayed as we were against giving them land in corridor patches of Belghata and Bholabuj in Sindewahi,” said Dhotre.

“On one hand, road widening is opposed as user agencies are not taking mitigation steps in corridor patches, while on the other, the forest department intends to destroy tiger habitats by razing huge canopy to relocate Kolsa villagers. This is unacceptable. Earlier, the decision to relocate Fulzari (Pench) was rejected by MoEFCC as the proposed site was dense forest,” said conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar.

The bench comprising Justice Sangeet Raj Lodha and Justice Mahendra Goyal gave this interim direction while hearing the leave to appeal filed by Syed Sarwar Chishty, who is also a complainant in the Ajmer Dargah blast case.

The court dealing with NIA cases had sentenced Patel and Gupta to life and acquitted seven accused including Aseemanand on March 22, 2017.

Chisthy moved an application challenging the acquittal and the verdict given by the NIA court.

Advocate Rambabu Sharma said, “In the appeal, we have stated that the punishment given to the accused in the case is less and the other accused have been wrongly acquitted. We have also prayed that all the accused should be convicted and given capital punishment.”

It is noteworthy that the two accused including Patel and Gupta were sentenced to life imprisonment in this case. However, their sentence was suspended by the high court after an appeal filed by them.

At the same time, another accused Suresh Nair was also acquitted by the special court of NIA cases on December 19, 2019.

A blast took place at Ajmer’s sufi shrine of Khwaja Moiundhin Chisthy around 6.15 pm on October 11, 2007. Three people were killed while 15 people were injured. In this case, statements of a total of 184 people were recorded, in which 26 important witnesses turned hostile.

The people who were accused by the NIA court included Chandrashekhar Leve, Mukesh Vasani, Bharat Mohan Rateshwar, Lokesh Sharma, Mehul Kumar and Harshad Solanki.

Gold biscuits seized by DRI from the Korean citizen on Friday

JAIPUR: A 32-year-old Korean national was arrested by the Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), an anti-smuggling wing of the customs department at the Jaipur airport with an illegal possession of 4.5 kg of gold in biscuit form. The price of the gold seized from the possession of the tourist worth nearly 1.85 crore in the international market. This is first ever case when a Korean national is caught for smuggling in Rajasthan as claimed by the DRI officials.

Based on specific inputs the sleuths of the DRI checked the baggage of Korean national on Friday morning when he came from Ahmedabad in a domestic flight.

“Usually we can’t check the baggage of the domestic passengers. Since we had our intelligence input his bag and other things were checked. We found 45 gold biscuits each weight 100 grams which was 4.5 kg in total,” said a senior officer of DRI, Jaipur on the condition of anonymity.

Sleuths of DRI were facing lot of problems in the interrogation of the accused Korean national as communication has been a big barrier. The authorities were stunned to witness a very different and new modus operandi by the smugglers.

BENGALURU: The high court on Friday described as shocking the state government’s callous approach towards 113 cases of child sexual abuse, including pornography, revealed in data published by the ministry of women and child development in September 2018.

“It is difficult to educate government officers beyond a particular level,” a division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka said, while indicating that it may direct for the personal appearance of the senior-most officer of the police department (DGP) over the failure to register basic FIRs, an elementary exercise under criminal law, in the cases.

The bench wondered how the state could be so callous and claim that no such incidents have been reported when the central ministry published data about 113 cases of sexual abuse targeting children housed in welfare centres, and the offences are serious in nature.

The court is hearing a PIL filed by Bachpan Bachao Andolan and Sampurna Behura, both New Delhi-based organisations. They have sought a direction for formulating a new or amended state child protection programme as the old policy restricts itself to children in school.

Citing the high number of cases found in the ministry’s data, both the organisations have sought for a status report on rehabilitation of the children and legal action against erring officials, apart from a probe by a special investigation team into the cases.

347,['11/01/2020'],Capital area continues to boil as women join protesting farmers,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Amaravati: Vijayawada and many villages in the capital region remained tense as protests against the proposal to shift the capital from Amaravati continued on Friday.

In most of the capital city villages, farmers, including women, braved police restrictions to participate in the protests. In Mandadam and Thullur, women offered prayers at local temple and set on a procession to go to Kanaka Durga temple.

Tension prevailed in Thullur when police prevented the women trying to breach the security cordon to go to Kanaka Durga temple. Women told the cops they did not need police permission to visit the temple. They asked the police to allow them to enter the temple as they were not going to battle against the government. With police refusing, the women confronted the forces.

The police resorted to mild lathicharge to disperse the crowd and restored control. The said the government should retain the capital city in Amaravati. They cursed the chief minister for deploying the police forces in peaceful villages and preventing them from visiting temples.

A similar situation prevailed in Mandadam where women gathered in huge numbers at a local temple. With cops preventing them from reaching the temple, the farmers took strong exception to the police attitude.

BJP state president Kanna Lakshminarayana condemned the police action against women. He flayed the chief minister for using police force to curb democratic protests. “Jagan had staged several agitations when he was opposition leader and has become an undemocratic force after becoming the CM,” said Lakshminarayana.

Rural district superintendent of police Ch Vijaya Rao said the police did not resort to lathicharge anywhere in the capital city. He said they requested the women to drop their plans to go in groups keeping in view of the restrictions imposed in the area. “We are duty bound to protect the law and order. We are not there to harm anyone,” said Vijaya Rao. He appealed to people to cooperate with the police and drop plans to take out rallies, dharnas and protests.

Meanwhile, Vijayawada city police locked up the Amaravati JAC office in Benz Circle and directed the convention centre owner not to lease it out to protests.

Panaji: The department of industries, trade and commerce plans to launch a scheme to incentivise the bee-keeping (or apiculture ) in Goa. The scheme, with an allocation of Rs 75 lakh, will provide beehives to at least 100 trained bee-keepers at subsidised rate over the next five years, said officials.

“The scheme is meant for promotion of the bee-keeping industry, as bee-keeping leads to an increase in agricultural produce in the vicinity to the tune of 30% and the honey produced will supplement the income of the (scheme) applicant,” reads the proposal - likely to be announced in next few days.

The scheme, which is being given a push by industries minister, Vishwajit Rane , will provide funding to trained bee-keepers to help facilitate setting up of a beekeeping cluster and will also facilitate packaging of the produce. Rane is also the minister for skill development and entrepreneurship.

In October, the state government kick-started a large scale drive to train women and farmers in bee-keeping. Women farmer groups were identified as part of the initiative, with support from the Khadi and village industries commission (KVIC) and the agriculture technology management agency (Atma).

In Goa, KVIC will be the implementing agency of the scheme and applicants can avail a subsidy of 90% of the cost of up to 10 beehives and other equipment. Applicants from the SC/ST community will be eligible for 95% subsidy with an appraisal committee clearing the subsidy disbursal for all applicants.

The scheme will also provide support for skill development, technical know-how, quality control, certification and processing of by-products, which could be set up under cluster development schemes.

KVIC has identified beneficiaries from various villages like Morjim, Old Goa, Bicholim and Dabhal where bee-keeping could be taken up.

JMC conducted a anti-encroachment drive at Chandpole area in Walled City (File Photo)

JAIPUR: A 17-day anti-encroachment drive will be launched inside the Walled City from January 15 to remove squatters from the market.

Hawamahal zone deputy commissioner Surendra Yadav had requested the commissioner of Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC), Vijay Pal Singh, for permission to start the drive.

“Under this drive, we will remove the encroachments from the verandas and market areas. Hundreds of street vendors and shopkeepers have been encroaching the Walled City making it difficult for commuters and customers. This drive was under planning for a long time,” said Yadav. The JMC officials, however, denied that the move had anything to do with the Walled City being declared as a no-construction zone.

Surendra said, “The decision to remove illegal constructions will be taken after the heritage bylaws are notified and a committee under it is formed. That committee will take into consideration the drone survey conducted about the illegal buildings in the walled city. The drive starting from January 15 will be a planned drive for just encroachments.” Though the government has declared Walled City as a no-construction zone, the orders were not executed sincerely. Rampant construction has been going inside the city right under the nose of the authorities. Around Johri Bazaar and Kishanpole area, many under-construction buildings can be seen.

Representative image

BENGALURU: After multiple rounds of litigation spanning three decades and extending to the Supreme Court , the saga of a tourist cab which was seized over 31 years ago by the Regional Transport Office, Hassan, will finally come to an end.

The state government has agreed to a transport department proposal for releasing Rs 1,90,855 in favour of Kaleem Pasha, a resident of Magge village in Alur taluk in Hassan district, as per an order passed by the Karnataka high court on March 8, 2018, which has been upheld by the Supreme Court.

The amount to be paid to Pasha includes Rs 38,950 with 15% interest per annum from April 24, 1993 till May 31, 2019. Pasha had bought the tourist taxi in August 1989.

The vehicle originally belonged to a man called Ameer and was seized on December 24, 1988, by the Hassan RTO for non-payment of taxes. On August 8, the vehicle was auctioned at Hassan traffic police station. HR Shivashankar purchased the vehicle for Rs 20,200 and 10 days later, sold it to Pasha for Rs. 30,000. But Ameer moved the high court, challenging the auction. On February 20, 1991, the court ruled in Ameer’s favour.

The authorities were told to hand over the vehicle to Ameer, after collecting dues, but no order was passed on Pasha’s claim. Soon, Pasha moved a local court, seeking Rs 61,400 which he had invested. He said he had entered into a hire purchase agreement with a firm for purchase of the said vehicle and also spent Rs 8,950 on repairs and some more amount for obtaining a temporary permit. In all, he claimed Rs 41,400 was invested in addition to the purchase value. He added that he owed Rs 17,985 with 21% interest on the said amount to the firm with which he had an agreement.

However, authorities claimed Pasha could only proceed against Shivashankar. On September 26, 2000, the local court dismissed Pasha’s claim. He appealed before the district court in Hassan, but the plea was dismissed in 2004. He approached the high court which ruled in his favour in 2018. However, the state government moved the the Supreme Court.

353,['11/01/2020'],Ruias and Mittal lock horns over control of Hazira port,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Essar group promoter Prashant Ruia

AHMEDABAD: After a long-drawn battle to take control over debt-ridden Essar Steel, the Ruias of Essar group andruL N Mittal of ArcelorMittal group have locked horns for wresting control of the captive port at the steel plant facility at Hazira.

While Essar wants to handle third-party cargo – commercial cargo from other industries -- as per the state’s New Port Policy for the two captive jetties in Hazira that are owned by Essar Bulk Terminal Ltd, ArcelorMittal has opposed the move, said sources close to the matter.

ArcelorMittal, which acquired the steel facility in November after the Supreme Court approved its resolution plan, has renamed Essar Steel to AM/NS India, now a joint venture of ArcelorMittal with Nippon Steel group.

The Gujarat Maritime Board, the state’s maritime regulator, signed a supplementary agreement on December 13 with the promoters of Essar group, who own 74% in Essar Bulk Terminal Ltd, allowing them to handle third party cargo without any quantitative restriction. The GMB decision, however, has been put in abeyance by the state government after ArcelorMittal protested the decision – the same day when Laxmi Mittal called on chief minister Vijay Rupani on December 17.

The agreement was not approved by the state government hence it was put on hold, said government sources. “The representations from affected parties are under examination by the government. The government is reviewing the development,” said Mukesh Kumar, vice-chairman and CEO, GMB.

Essar group promoter Prashant Ruia also met senior state government officials on January 9 to discuss the matter, said sources.

In October 2019, the GMB introduced the New Port Policy with a view to “unlocking value in existing port infrastructure by allowing existing captive jetty holders to handle third party cargo and opportunity for new players.” The new policy grants exiting captive jetty holders the option to either opt-in or opt-out of the said policy framework. If an existing captive jetty holder opts in, then they are required to enter supplementary agreement with GMB.

AM/NS India, which owns 26% stake in EBTL, has made several representations to the state government in December that allowing EBTL to opt-in to the new policy would give backdoor entry to a third party for converting a captive jetty into a commercial jetty. EBTL holds the license for the two jetties with a direct berthing and AM/NS India has asked the government to transfer the license to them.

""Now that AM/ NS is the owner of Essar Steel, it expects the existing long-term agreements that are in place [with EBTL] to continue and no changes to the jetty intended for captive usage should be made without the explicit consent of AM/NS India. The jetty was provided on nomination basis to the steel plant as a captive user,” said a spokesperson for AM/NS.

In all there are four captive jetties, two of which are lighterage and owned by AM/NS India. The total cargo handling capacity of the four jetties is 50 million tonnes per annum and EBTL has drawn plans to take it to 100 MTPA.

An ArcelorMittal representative when contacted declined to comment on the matter. An e-mail sent to him remained unanswered.

Essar group promoters have in their representation to the state stated that EBTL has invested more than Rs 3,000 crore in the two jetties and the port is largely unutilized as only 22 million tonnes of captive cargo is being handled presently.

“EBTL’s agreement with GMB is in lines of the new port policy which is aimed at increasing cargo of Gujarat ports. How can AM/NS India, which is a minority stakeholder in EBTL, decide whether the company should opt-in or opt-out of a policy,” said a company official.

“New port policy is applicable to all 38 captive jetties in Gujarat enabling utilization of surplus/unutilized jetty capacity for 3rd party commercial cargo. EBTL has, with requisite approvals, opted in under the new policy as per law and new policy guidelines. EBTL is an independent company that specializes in ports and not a cost centre. EBTL has developed and operated the port as per licenses granted to EBTL pursuant to the MOU signed with GMB at Vibrant Gujarat 2007,” an Essar group official said in an e-mail response.

EBTL’s opting into the New Port Policy in no way affects any legitimate interests of steel mill and apprehensions if any are completely misplaced and unwarranted as EBTL continues to provide un interrupted services to steel mill as per earlier contracts signed since 2011 which clearly acknowledges EBTL’s rights, title and interest in respect of such facilities, it said.

""Now that AM/ NS is the owner of Essar Steel, it expects the existing long-term agreements that are in place [with EBTL] to continue and no changes to the jetty intended for captive usage should be made without the explicit consent of AM/NS India. The jetty was provided on nomination basis to the steel plant as a captive user,” said a spokesperson for AM/NS.

NEW DELHI: While Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) on Friday called the Delhi Police investigation “a litany of distortions, half-truths and outright lies”, JNU Teachers’ Association ( JNUTA ) said the press conference called by police showed that the mob violence on January 5 had been “glossed over as a non-event”. Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), on the other hand, claimed the “truth of Left-perpetrated violence in JNU stands exposed”.

Barring two, all others named by Delhi Police are from Left groups or left-sympathisers. But JNUSU asked why police had named all Left organisations but not ABVP. It also questioned the decision to name JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh as a suspect when she had informed police about the violence.

“The silence of police on ABVP is deafening and its ploy to implicate the Left is an indication that this investigation is a political investigation with a clear agenda to placate Mr Amit Shah and ABVP, which can employ violence with impunity on the basis of its state backing,” JNUSU alleged. “The bent of the investigation and its insinuation point to a shameful collusion between ABVP and the state machinery, which must be exposed,” it added.

The exercise is meant to save ABVP and deflect attention from the violence, JNUSU claimed. “Police like the vice-chancellor is very fond of not taking the incident on January 5 in isolation. Never have the students of JNU either said the incidents of January 5 were in isolation. The police are conveniently talking the language of Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar,” it said.

The union appealed to people to see through this “malicious propaganda” being spread against JNU.

Terming the investigation disappointing, JNUTA demanded an independent probe. “Such underplaying of the incidents which shocked the nation and subjected several to extreme trauma is deeply disturbing,” JNUTA said while pointing out that police were yet to turn any of the teachers’ complaints into an FIR. This, along with the police attempt to paint JNUSU, which has been agitating against the fee hike for more than 75 days, as an unruly mob, reinforces “suspicions about the role of Delhi Police on the fateful day”, it added.

ABVP national general secretary Nidhi Tripathi, however, alleged the students disagreeing with the Left had always been subjected to violence by them at JNU and discriminated against by Left-wing teachers.

Coimbatore: The city corporation has introduced an accident insurance scheme for 20 sanitary workers, who clean manholes in the central zone.

The beneficiaries would receive up to Rs 10 lakh in case of fatal accidents and up to Rs 1 lakh for non-fatal accidents. This is in addition to the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojna that provides a life cover of Rs 2 lakh.

Corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar passed the order to include the workers under the scheme a week ago, said a corporation official. “Though the workers are using machines to clean manholes, there is a high chance of them inhaling toxic gases,” he said.

Forty-five sanitary workers are deployed to clean manholes in the city. “The civic body paid the annual premium of Rs 6,000 for the 20 workers covered under the scheme. We have initiated the process to include the others as well,” the official told TOI.

“The government had directed all local bodies to bring sanitary workers under insurance cover. All sanitary workers in Kerala and Karnataka have insurance cover, while their counterparts in Tamil Nadu were not included until recently,” said president of Social Justice Party N Pannerselvam. “By default, all uniformed officials have insurance and get risk allowance. After a long struggle, sanitary workers have been included in the scheme. But they are yet to get risk allowance,” he added.

Vijayawada: The high-power committee deliberating on decentralisation of development and administration, has decided to make recommendations for the development of Amaravati.

The meeting, held here on Friday, discussed the key recommendations of the GN Rao committee and the Boston Consulting Group on the capital relocation and development of the state.

As both the committees have favoured decentralization of administration, the high-power committee, consisting of 10 ministers and five senior officers, felt the need to address the issues of the people from the capital villages. They felt the need to hold talks with the people of Amaravati, besides exploring possibilities to develop Krishna, Guntur and Prakasam districts with focus on Amaravati.

The committee also decided to hold its next meeting on January 13 as it has been asked to complete its business at the earliest. The committee, headed by finance minister Buggana Rajendranath, had the initial study of the recommendations of the two committees at its first meeting held on January 8. On Friday, it focused on the recommendations suggested by both the committees to develop Krishna, Guntur and Prakasam districts, giving high priority to Amaravati.

The committee had a brief discussion on the promises made to the Amaravati farmers by the previous government and examined the proposals of the land pooling system (LPS) by the previous government. The capital region development authority (CRDA) officials briefed the committee on LPS and the commitments that the government has made with the farmers.

Some ministers felt the need to hold talks with the farmers’ representatives while some emphasized the need to develop the plots to be given to farmers in return for their land in the LPS.

The officials have told the committee to continue developmental works in the areas where the farmers were promised plots as that would silence the protest and pre-empt the opposition parties.

The committee also discussed the benefits to be offered to the secretariat employees if they were to move to Visakhapatnam. The committee studied the benefits offered by the previous government at the time of shifting them to Vijayawada from Hyderabad and decided to continue the benefits in Visakhapatnam.

Representative image

JAIPUR: Government school teachers’ attendance will soon be registered online on the Shala Darpan portal, which will help the government to keep a watch on the presence of teachers in the schools. The scheme was supposed to start on January 1, 2020, but now the date of launch has been deferred due to some technical issue.

At present, biometric machines have been installed in the schools, but the teachers’ salaries are not dependent on it. After this system starts on Shala Darpan, the attendance sheet has to be filed on the portal every day. This record will be used to calculate the salaries of the employees every month.

An official of the education department who did not wish to be named said that some technical glitches prevented them from starting this on January 1, 2020. “We are planning to launch it by January 20 and notification will be issued soon,” said the official.

To make this a success, all the employees of the education department including teachers were supposed to be registered on the Shala Darpan portal. However, nearly 95,000 teachers haven’t registered. This may create a hurdle for the government to make the scheme into a success.

The move to register the teachers’ attendance online is appreciated but the teachers’ association is claiming it will not be successful in rural areas where internet connectivity is slow.

Vipin Sharma, general secretary, Rajasthan Primary and Secondary Teachers’ Association said that there are villages where internet connectivity is not good. “We respect this decision as it can curb the problem of teachers not fulfilling their duties properly. However, in villages where there is no internet, teachers may lose their salary for no reason. This should not be compulsory for those places,” said Vipin.

COIMBATORE: Students of Camford International School at Maniakaranpalayam in the city attempted to enter the Guinness World Records by creating the largest notebook mosaic with a life-size image of Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar. This was done to mark the 10th anniversary of the school.

More than 170 students, selected from class eight upwards, began making the mosaic from 8.30am. They first designed the 1200 ft large mosaic through a photograph with grids and started placing coloured notebooks in the assigned slots to create the image.

They finished the attempt a little after 10.30 am. The notebooks were of two sizes – long and king size, and of 14 colours. The final mosaic included 29,971 notebooks.

The students had spent time practicing the formations prior to the day of the attempt.

According to the Guinness World Records, the previous attempt of this kind was done in Abu Dhabi in March 2018, in an area of 702.8 sqft.

The school believes that the notebook mosaic measuring 1,114.82 square metres – made by the students on January 10 – would break the existing record.

The school had also made the largest disposable paper cup mosaic of former President Abdul Kalam, in 2017, and another postcard mosaic of the Royal Bengal Tiger in 2013.

“BJP played a significant role in Andhra Pradesh’s bifurcation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone for the capital city in Amaravati. BJP should support Amaravati farmers,” Pawan said, while speaking to the media at Jana Sena head office in Mangalagiri.

He asked BJP leaders to make their views clear. “The BJP state leadership says it backs Amaravati. But one of their national spokespersons said that the party is not concerned about the proposal to shift the capital. The contradictory statements have created confusion,” the Jana Sena chief said.

He asked YSRC leaders and legislators to convince the farmers of Amaravati region about the proposals for three capitals. “YSRC is bringing regional disparities by giving different statements on Amaravati. They should take a stand on the capital and do justice to the farmers,” Pawan said.

Pawan added that he appreciated the fighting spirit of the farmers and said he would support them in every way possible.

JAIPUR: Doctors at private hospital here saved the life of a heart failure patient by connecting the pacemaker’s wire to the heart wire. At the same time, in another case, without performing open heart surgery, they succeeded in changing two valves simultaneously.

Dr Samin K Sharma, cardiologist and chairman of Eternal Hospital, claimed on Friday that both of these cases happened in the country for the first time. He told that it is unique in itself to connect the fourth wire directly to the heart wire when the other three wires of the pacemaker do not work properly. This helps in normalising the heartbeat by making equal current reach to all parts of the heart. Dr Jitendra Singh Makkar and Dr Kush Kumar Bhagat performed the surgery. While in the another case, Dr Ravindra Singh Rao replaced two valves of a patient’s heart simultaneously without open surgery. Aortic and mitral valves have been replaced by trans-catheter valve replacement technology . Dr Samin said that it is the hospital’s endeavour that modern techniques being adopted in the US should be made available to the common patients in Jaipur too.

Shakuntala Devi, 67, of Bharatpur had been suffering for a long time and her heart’s performance was reduced to 15 to 20%. The three wires of the pacemaker did not work, so to save her life, by adopting HOT-CRT technology, the fourth wire was connected to the heart’s main wire.

Sarita, 78, from Nagpur, had complaints of breathing and chest pain. Her two valves were not working. Open heart surgery was conducted on her to replace a valve in 2012, but now two valves were damaged. Performing open surgery again could prove dangerous due to the patient’s age and earlier operation. So, she was treated using the trans-catheter aortic valve replacement technique.

JAISALMER: Jaisalmer is the only district in the state where the Supreme Court has stayed the election in all the panchayat samitis .

The state election commission on Thursday late night issued a list in which panchayati raj elections have been postponed in many gram panchayats across the state. The list comprised all the 167 gram panchayats of Jaisalmer, among others.

According to the list issued by the state election commission, the election of few panchayats have been stalled in few districts but Jaisalmer is the only district where elections in all the gram panchayats have been stayed.

After this decision, the political calculations in all the panchayats have changed. In many panchayats, sarpanchs have been elected unanimously but now they are unable to understand whether to celebrate or get disappointed. Many candidates had filed their nominations and were considering themselves winners, but now confusion prevails amid uncertainty. Candidates for post of sarpanch have spent lakhs of rupees in their areas. On Thursday, the state election commission had issued the order, along with the list to all district election officers.

District collector Namit Mehta said that as per the SEC programme, out of 167 gram panchayats, the election process was started in 97 gram panchayats, under which applications were received and scrutiny was done and even withdrawal had taken place, but now, after the Supreme Court stay, the process of delimitation in all gram panchayats in Jaisalmer has been affected and after the orders, the election has been postponed and new date for election will be announced soon.

VIJAYAWADA: Amidst prevailing tension across the capital region, five women out of 3,000 from Mandadam village managed to march their way to visit Kanaka Durga temple to offer prayers on Friday.

Cops stopped thousands of women protesters in their tracks from marching towards the temple as they were already denied permission for the rally from Uddandarayunipalem village in the morning. Cops even initiated lathicharge against them after they tried to continue on their March at Thullur, Uddandarayunipalem and even at Bandar road in Vijayawada.

However, the cops did permit five women amongst them to go to the temple who offered prayers to the goddess that chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy should change his mind over the trifurcation of the capital and retain Amaravati.

Tension prevailed as the cops began detaining several women who vehemently tried to overpower them and continue their march.

Guntur urban police and Vijayawada commissionerate unit had issued an advisory on Thursday that no permission would be granted for the proposed rally citing that it would create ‘traffic problems’ as the Benz Circle flyover works are under way. Even AP Police Headquarters warned that action would be taken as per law if anyone violated the prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC were already in place.

Dr Niraj Rai delivers Bal Gangadhar Tilak memorial lecture on Thursday

Nagpur: People should look at a number of perspectives like culture, customs, languages and anthropology in view of various ethnic groups and different population backgrounds to understand the structure of demography in the current form. Archaeology plays an important role in understanding all these aspects, said scientist Niraj Rai of Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP), Lucknow, on Thursday.

He was speaking on ‘Recent research in ancient Indian genetics: An archaeological perspective’ at the Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak memorial lecture organized by the PG department of ancient Indian history, culture and archaeology at Dr AK Dorle auditorium, Nagpur University campus off Amravati Road.

Present at the lecture were officiating pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande and professor and head of the department Preety Trivedi.

Shedding light on the anthropological facet, Rai said, “I am using archaeological and anthropological tools as an endeavour to connect knowledge with the advent of genetics. To study genetic structure of India, we have to keep several things in mind. Anthropologically, the Indian subcontinent was divided on the basis of languages. With different languages spoken across the regions, we have language barriers that have created groups having distinct identities.”

He said, “We have more than 4,500 well-defined population groups in the country, including 532 tribes and 72 primitive tribes. We have variety in languages, physical appearances and genetic architecture. This diversity forms due to variation in DNA.”

Speaking about evolution of modern humans, Rai drew parallels and pointed out the differences between human beings and our closest ancestor, the chimpanzee.

He said, “We don’t have much archaeological records of chimpanzees, but we do have an account of the hominin species. With the development in DNA technology, researchers have been able to read the sequencing of DNA codes of chimpanzees and modern humans all over the world. They discovered that our DNA matches up to 99% with the chimpanzees.”

Explaining the reasoning behind studying data from the past, Rai said it is like a time machine. “You can revisit the past and study how the changes in demography occurred over a period of time,” he said. He talked about his case study on ‘Reconstruction of the genetic make-up of Harappans’ and spoke about colonization of India at length.

Trivedi said, “Since childhood, our history books taught us about the Indus Valley civilization, influx and settling of the Vedic Aryans on the Indian soil, followed by multiple invasions from various people and countries. However, history being a discipline of continuous re-interpretation, research has been pursued in the past several decades to authenticate various theories regarding the origin and evolution of Indians and our culture.”

Data released by different agencies shows a mismatch when it comes to road accidents in Vijayawada city

VIJAYAWADA: While road accidents across the country remained more or less same in 2018 as compared to 2017, Andhra Pradesh is among the only states which recorded a declining trend in the total number of accidents. The state has reported 6.4 per cent less accidents in the year 2018 when compared to 2017, according to the data released by the National Crime Records Bureau ( NCRB ).However, data released by different agencies shows a mismatch when it comes to road accidents in Vijayawada city. According to the city police, there were 1,644 accidents in 2017, whereas NCRB data says there were 1,491 accidents. The data given by the ministry of road transport and highways shows that 1,648 accidents took place in Vijayawada city during 2017.For 2018, city police data suggests that 1,658 accidents took place, while NCRB data shows the number of accidents as 1,663 and according to the transport ministry data the number of accidents was 1,648.While NCRB data suggests that accidents are in an increasing trend in Vijayawada, city police claim that the number of accidents has actually come down. And this is, they say, despite a multi-fold increase in vehicular traffic after the city was made part of the capital. They also add that the decline in accidents is due to the effective enforcement measures they have undertaken.On the other hand, the number of railway accidents increased in Andhra Pradesh by about 12 per cent during the same period. At the same time, Vijayawada city has saw a 11 per cent increase in number of road accidents, recording an increasing trend, contrary to the declining trend in the state overall.When it comes to cause of accidents, over-speeding and negligent driving are the main culprits contributing to a majority of deaths in Andhra Pradesh. Weather conditions, defective vehicles, animal crossing, lack of road infrastructure, and parking vehicles on road shoulders were found to be the common causes of road accidents in the state.About 38 per cent of the accidents deaths took place on national highways, 24 per cent deaths happened on state highways and other roads contributed 38 per cent of deaths in Andhra Pradesh.",vijayawada,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73201180,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-172878,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/road-accidents-down-in-state-but-increase-in-city/articleshow/73195820.cms

NAMAKKAL: A 40-year-old government schoolteacher was on Friday sentenced to five years imprisonment for forcing a Class II student to clean human excreta from the classroom. The special court for SC/ST cases in the district combined court that heard the case also slapped on her a fine of Rs 1,000.

A court source identified the convict as R Vijayalakshmi, who was employed with the Namakkal municipality middle school in Ramapuram Pudur.

“When she entered the classroom on November 12, 2015, she found human excreta there. When she inquired, someone informed her that it was the doing of a Class III student the previous evening after school hours. Vijayalakshmi forced V Sasidharan, a Class II student, to clean the human excreta using his bare hands,” the source said.

Sasidharan informed his parents, who along with their relatives and neighbours, laid siege to the school the next day, demanding stern action against the teacher .

The then Namakkal superintendent of police, S R Senthilkumar, and education department officials pacified the crowd and assured stringent action against the teacher.

The Namakkal town police arrested Vijayalakshmi the same day (November 13, 2015) and lodged her in the Salem central women' s prison under judicial custody. The education department officials, meanwhile, placed her under suspension.

The case was heard by sessions judge K Dhanasekaran. After hearing both the sides, the judge sentenced Vijayalakshmi to five years imprisonment on Friday.

KOLHAPUR: Co-operation and marketing minister Balasaheb Patil said that the state government was considering extension in the limit of the loan waiver amount set for farmers.

Addressing the media in Karad , Patil said that government would soon form a committee to derive a solution to the problems faced by farmers who had taken loan of more than Rs two lakh.

He said that the government has already waived off farmers’ loans of up to Rs 2 lakh. He said that the committee is also expected to address the problems of the farmers who were paying regular instalments, but are facing financial crisis.

Patil said that the government would also decide on the loans that were taken by deceased farmers. In normal circumstances, the loan account is transferred to the legal heirs of the deceased; However, at times, some complications arise if the legal heirs are also defaulters”, he said, adding that the issue is crucial as only one member of a family can take benefit of loan waiver scheme. Patil said that the government was facing many such difficulties which it is planning to address soon with the help of the committee.

He indicated that the government may go soft on the cooperative institutions which are facing legal and financial problems at the moment. He also said that Maharashtra has a large network of cooperative institutions and the decision taken by the government would be in the interest of depositors, institutions and stakeholders.

AMARAVATI: In what could be considered as the final nail on the coffin of Amaravati, the government has decided not to constitute a metropolitan civic body for the ‘capital city’. Instead, it has decided to conduct the elections to all village panchayats within the capital city without altering their local body status. The residents will now elect sarpanches and ward members to their respective village panchayats.

The previous TDP government wanted to make the capital city area a municipal corporation by merging the villages in its ambit. It had also filed an affidavit in the high court in support of petitions challenging the land acquisition in the area. It stated that the government had decided to constitute a mega civic body under Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA). However, the TDP government had failed to go ahead with the plan although the term of the panchayats expired almost 18 months before the general elections. “The TDP government had not even moved a proposal to merge all the villages into a new civic body. They just made big promises,” rued a local farmer.

After the change of guard in the general elections, the Jaganmohan Reddy government had listed out its priorities for the development of the state and made it clear that spending a large amount of funds into Amaravati villages on the pretext of building a capital city was not on its agenda. After making plans to shift the seat of power to Visakhapatnam from Amaravati, the state government has directed Guntur district administration to finalise the reservations to the village local bodies as per the rules. District administration has already fixed the reservations for sarpanches, ward members, MPTCs in all the 29 villages in the capital region.

Meanwhile, the district administration is gearing up to issue the notification for elections to mandal parishad (MPTC) and zilla parishad territorial constituencies (ZPTC) on January 17 and village panchayats on February 8.

CHENNAI: Two days after the Bengaluru police picked up three men for harbouring key accused in the July 18, 2014, murder of Hindu Munnani leader K P S Suresh Kumar at Ambattur and preparing fake travel documents for them, a city court sent them to 10-day police custody . The three were brought to Chennai on Thursday and remanded in custody.

‘Q’ branch officials arrested Mohamed Haneef Khan, 29, Imran Khan, 32, and Mohamed Zaid, 24, for harbouring Syed Ali Nawas, Abdul Shamim, and Khaja Moideen and helping them get fake documents to travel abroad.

Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu ‘Q’ branch sleuths had arrested 28-year-old Liyakath Ali of Salem last week on suspicion of being an ISIS sympathiser.

All four were produced before the second metropolitan magistrate court in Egmore on Friday. The ‘Q’ branch sleuths filed two separate petitions before the court seeking 10 days custody to interrogate the four.

Magistrate Roshlin Durai granted police 10 days custody to question Mohamed Haneef Khan, Imran Khan, and Mohamed Zaid, while sanctioning just four days custody for Liyakath Ali. Ali is to be produced before the court on January 13.

Police suspect Khaja Moideen has been indoctrinating youth across the state since 2004. The day Delhi police announced his arrest, the Gujarat police picked up a man from Cuddalore at Vadodara on suspicion of ISIS links. Police also suspect SSI Wilson was gunned down by Shamim and Thowfique in a fit of rage once they heard Khaja Moideen had been picked up.

381,['11/01/2020'],Marathon to create awareness on child abuse,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Vellore: Aiming to curb crime against and sexual abuse of children, the Vellore district administration along with the education department and an NGO on Thursday organised a 3-km marathon from Katpadi Odai Pillaiyar temple to Panchayat union primary school in Gandhi Nagar.

More than 200 school and college students in and around Gandhi Nagar took part in the marathon holding placards.

Flagging off the awareness rally, collector A Shanmuga Sundaram said that within just nine days since the advent of the New Year, as many as three sexual abuse cases have been registered in Vellore district alone. Despite steps to ensure the accused face stringent punishment without any escape, lack of awareness on child abuse aids such crimes against children, he said. It’s the responsibility of every citizen to create a safer place for children by preventing their abuse, he said. Shanmuga Sundaram also applauded students and children for voluntarily participating in the marathon for a noble cause.

While addressing the students, Shanmuga Sundaram spotted a woman along with her baby seeking alms from passengers and commuters near the Odai Pillaiyar temple bus stop. Following this, he personally inquired with the woman and identified her to be Malleswari of Puthur from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.

The woman said she was a destitute and after she lost the support of her relatives, has been leading a miserable existence begging. Based on the direction by the collector to lodge the woman and her child in a safe place until officials of social welfare department hold an inquiry, she was shifted to an orphanage in Katpadi by revenue officials.

382,['11/01/2020'],Differences likely to delay appointment of guardian min,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Pune: Sharp differences among three ruling parties – NCP , Congress and Shiv Sena – over the appointment of district guardian minister for Kolhapur have come to the fore. Congress minister Balasaheb Thorat was appointed the guardian minister but has refused to take charge.

Congress workers in Kolhapur are unhappy with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who they feel is acting at the behest of NCP leadership. Congress sources said minister of state for home, Satej Patil, has been deliberately sidelined and given responsibility of Bhandara district in Vidarbha region, which is far away from his home district.

Congress workers also claim that Patil’s appointment as district guardian minister has been scuttled because of strong opposition from a section of Shiv Sena leaders. Patil enjoys good relationship with Sena MP Sanjay Mandlik, which is not accepted by many Sena workers. Old Sena activists have always been raising doubt about Mandlik’s loyalty to the party and fear that he would eventually join Congress. Patil had publicly helped Mandlik in Lok Sabha election, defying party orders.

Patil’s supporters are disappointed that he was not accommodated as cabinet minister. Sources in Congress said Thorat, who is also revenue minister, is inclined to appoint Patil but NCP and Sena are reluctant over the move.

Thorat is expected to take up the issue with party high command. Thorat was scheduled to meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray but the meeting could not take place as Thackeray was not in Mumbai.

Thorat is also said to be upset as he feels that he was not taken into confidence while appointing Hasan Mushrif as Ahmednagar district guardian minister. Ahmednagar is home district of Thorat. Similarly, Thorat was not given idea before announcement of his appointment as guardian minister for Kolhapur. Congress workers feel that Thackeray has taken the decision under the pressure from NCP.

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) engineers on Friday decided to go on a common leave for an indefinite period for assigning them non-technical works due to a shortage of staff. The mayor, however, claimed that the engineers will join regular work from Monday onwards.

The engineers are employed in various departments of KMC such as the public works department, project department, town planning department, water supply department, divisional ward offices, and electricity department. They claim that there is a shortage of engineers in the KMC.

Responding to the decision, mayor Surmanjiri Latkar met the delegation of engineers and assured them that a meeting will be convened to resolve the issues soon. Upon discussing with mayor, the engineers decided to resume the work from Monday onwards.

The engineers claimed that they hardly get time to look into the technical proposals which are submitted by the administration. At present several works are undertaken by the KMC which requires technical expertise. Ghatge said, “Several development works are going on in the city. We have to put our all technical knowledge in it for which we have to attend these works for full-time of our duty hours. Many man-days are lost in attending non-technical works.”

The engineers claimed that they are held responsible if public infrastructure turns out to be of the sub-standard quality.

390,['11/01/2020'],Forest rights: 100 claims to be settled per mnth,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Margao: The South Goa district administration has set a target of disposing 100 claims per month over land rights made by forest dwelling scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers under the Forest Rights Act.

After conducting a review meeting of the progress of processing of the claims with revenue and forest officials, South Goa district collector Ajit Roy exuded confidence of meeting the target. “We have upgraded our target of clearing claims to 100 every month. Recently 59 sanads were issued to claimants,” he said.

Taking cognisance of the lack of coordination between revenue and forest officials in matters regarding processing of claims, Roy is learnt to have put in place a mechanism to ensure synergy between the two departments.

Sources privy to the meeting said that Roy took stock of the factors delaying the disposal of the cases. Sources said that lack of documentation by claimants and the requirement of 50% quorum at gram sabhas have turned out to be major impediments in speedy processing of claims.

Sources pointed out to a resolution of a long-pending issue in Deusa-Deau in Quepem where the tribal claimants had objected to the forest survey conducted using Google maps in 2005, complaining that their houses and properties were not correctly shown in them.

“The satellite image didn’t show their houses and other structures as they were covered by trees and foliage. The revenue officials then relied on birth certificates produced by the tribals in support of their claims of community existence,” a source said.

Alappuzha: Fishermen have hailed the Supreme Court verdict upholding the Kerala HC for demolishing the Kapico resort on Nediyathuruthu Island in Panavally grama panchayat here. According to A K Sailan, 53, an inland fisherman of Panavally, they started the legal battle against Kapico after the resort authorities removed 13 of their licensed stake nets.

Panavally grama panchayat president Pradeep Koodaikkal welcomed the SC verdict. “But we don’t have funds or expertise to demolish the buildings,” he said. Grama panchayat secretary Usha P M said that they have started revenue recovery procedures as the Kapico Resort failed to pay the building tax of Rs 66,80,731 from 2013-2014 to 2018-2019 first half.

District collector M Anjana said that they will start the action once they received the apex court order.

392,['11/01/2020'],Fog-related mishaps on highways expose Rajasthan government’s safety measures,"Police attributed the rise in accidents to the tendency of overtaking

Times View Bikaner, Churu and Sriganganagar districts are notorious for foggy mornings and evenings during winters. Though several highway accidents have taken place at Deshnok, Lakshasar and Jophasar in Bikaner district due to poor visibility over the last few days, the administration is yet to wake up from its slumber. In fact, none of the district administrations has taken steps to curb accidents. Most of the major mishaps are followed by debates, discussions and assurances of new traffic guidelines, identification of dark patches, installation of reflectors and speed-breakers on accident-prone highways, but most of these remain on paper. The district administration, transport department and police need to team up to address the problem. A well-designed campaign should also be launched by them against private bus operators to ensure that speed-limits are adhered to. Police and administration should sit with private bus and truck operators and warn them of punitive action if road rules are flouted.

JAIPUR: At least 50 people lost their lives in November last year due to poor visibility owing to fog on National Highway-11 in Bikaner . Thursday’s accident — in which eight persons were killed in the collision between a van and a bus in Churu district — has exposed the lofty claims of the administration on curbing accidents.TOI on Friday spoke to district collectors of Bikaner and Churu, which have seen maximum number of accidents from November 2019 onwards.Though the district administration had advocated for some measures to curb road accidents especially when visibility becomes an issue due to fog, nothing concrete has been done. “Majority of the bus operators promise to decrease the travel time as they promise four hours to reach Jaipur from Bikaner which has a total distance of nearly 377km. This is the main problem which leads to accidents,” said Ratan Singh, a native of Deshnok.While the local administration had announced to take measures and issue some guidelines, nothing much has been done except pasting the phone numbers of police control rooms in various buses. “In most of the accidents, it was found that drivers were overtaking while speeding. We have spoken to the bus operators, transporters and other stakeholders and urged them to follow the rules,” said a senior police officer of Bikaner district.However, after Thursday’s accident, the district collector of Bikaner Kumar Pal Gautam made a visit to the highway and instructed police officials to be extra vigilant during foggy weather. “We have four interceptors and have identified 27 dark spots. There are some curves and some technical issues which need to be rectified. We have issued stickers to private and RSRTC bus operators that have important telephone numbers,” said Gautam.Churu district is no different where the police have got merely one interceptor and the district too has some grey areas. “We had written to the highway authorities to put some speed breakers, put reflectors and have also asked the Public Works and Engineering Department to make efforts in identifying the spots where the accidents have taken place,” said an officer. When contacted, Sandesh Nayak, district collector, Churu, said, “We have asked the police, DTOs and transport authorities to intensify patrolling during the early and late evening hours, when there is heavy fog.”Police attributed the rise in accidents to the tendency of overtaking.“We have urged private bus operators, transporters to avoid overtaking especially when visibility is poor. We have also pasted our numbers in buses so that when a driver of a bus drives rashly, any passenger in the bus can call up the police,” said a senior officer of Rajgarh police station in Churu.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73198180,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-674563,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fog-related-mishaps-on-highways-expose-raj-govts-safety-measures/articleshow/73196581.cms

JAIPUR: Seven of the eight youngsters — who died after the van in which they were travelling in, collided head on with a bus coming from opposite direction on Bikaner-Churu highway — were childhood friends. People living in Subashpura locality in Bikaner were shocked and shattered to know that the youths played together, studied together and even died together.

A day after the fatal mishap, everyone, from a 10-year-old boy Shehshak to 66-year-old Barkatullah, were in tears and could not believe the nightmare. None of the natives of Subashpura locality had dinner on Thursday after the funeral of the eight youngsters killed in the accident . On Friday, majority of the people either visited the nearby temples or the mosques to offer prayers for the departed souls. “They used to play cricket together, were in school together and now they all departed together in the mishap,” Rehana Khatoon, a native of Subashpura locality told TOI over phone while sobbing.

The deceased were identified Shafeeq Khan (26), Ramzan (22) his brother Akram (23), Ansar Khan (23), Sadik Khan (23), Asif Hassan (23), Ankit Jangir (25) and Mohit (23).

“We were preparing for the wedding of Shafeeq Khan and his elder brother and suddenly we had to prepare for their burial. Everyone is shattered. God knows what the family will do,” said Arif Khan, one of the relatives of Shafeeq on Friday.

Nagpur: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah must go through ‘agnipariksha’ (acid test) like Sita as they have lost the trust of Indian citizens, said Pune-based lawyer Asim Sarode during a talk on ‘CAA/NRC Rashtrahitache Ahet Ka?’ at Dhanwate Sabhagruh, Shankar Nagar, on Friday.

Seeking the test as decreed on Sita by Lord Ram, Sarode said Modi and Shah must not make CAA and NRC a prestige issue. “The government must tell people in writing that it will not implement the Act,” Sarode said, during the talk organized by Swaraj Foundation and Akanksha Prakashan.

“Since December 29 last year, both Modi and Shah have made a U-turn on NRC while trying to allay apprehensions among Muslims that they wouldn’t become stateless after CAA is implemented,” he said.

Addressing a gathering of around 100 teachers, professionals and intellectuals, Sarode said he had made it clear before coming here that if the event was organized by Muslims he wouldn’t come. “Then, it becomes a communal affair which is exactly what Modi and Shah want to polarize people for votebank,” he said.

In a backhand compliment, Sarode said, “We need to thank Modi and Shah. We the people started understanding the Indian Constitution. In a society where law is left unto lawyers and courts to interpret, it is good the citizens are becoming aware.”

Flashing a copy of the Citizenship Act 1955, Sarode said the law without amendment was stringent enough to deal with “illegal immigrants” and intruders. “It was amended five times before 2014, but no one came to know about it. Why, because there was no ill-intention or criminal conspiracy,” he said, adding that the amendment plays a mischief.

In his over 90-minute speech, Sarode questioned Modi and Shah’s understanding of the Act and Constitution. “When uneducated people try to make a law, it is a foolish Act, but when religious fanatics do it, it becomes poisonous. Grave injustices were meted out to Babasaheb Ambedkar, but while framing the Constitution, he didn’t do anything to take revenge,” he said.

Sarode ridiculed home minister Shah for his now viral comment ‘understand the chronology’ by reading out a sequence of Supreme Court judgements, historical facts and developments since 1947 which clearly guarantee equality to all.

“No protests as seen now took place when the Act was being framed between 1947 and 1955,” he said.

The lawyer called for a “detox’ from the poison spread in people’s mind while dubbing CAA/NRC unconstitutional and discriminatory on religious basis.

Vijayawada: In a first, the Anti-Corruption Bureau ( ACB ) held simultaneous raids at various sub-registrar offices across the 13 districts in the state and recovered over Rs 10 lakh of unaccounted money on Friday.

According to officials, ACB had taken cognisance of complaints about corruption coming in via the new toll free number 14400 at various sub-registrar offices. While it has been conducting surprise checks in a suo-moto manner against sub-registrar offices, this was the first time that massive ACB teams were deployed to raid revenue offices.

In Vijayawada, ACB raided Gunadala sub-registrar office and seized Rs 19,240 of unaccounted money. According to rules, any money standing beyond Rs 5,000 brought into a government office by an employee has to be declared. However, all the SROs that ACB raided had undeclared cash in the official’s possession. The highest amount was recovered from Anantapuram rural SRO—Rs 2.15 lakh in cash. SROs in Palasa in Srikakulam and Kakinada in East Godavari had over Rs 1 lakh of unaccounted money.

Officials said this was just a one-day collection of unaccounted money from these offices and said the magnitude of corruption would be more if one calculated all working days in a year. Overall, Rs 10.34 lakh cash was recovered across 13 districts in AP.

KOCHI: The district collector on Friday issued an order imposing section 144 of the CrPC, from 8am to 5pm on January 11 and 12, in the exclusion zone of the buildings to be demolished in Maradu .

Accordingly, no one will be allowed entry within a 200m radius from the point of the blast during this period. Unauthorised parking, operation of drones and lanterns in the region will not be permitted. Also, people will not be allowed to use any type of fireworks, electronic equipment or gadgets. Further, all traffic — by air, water and land — is prohibited in the evacuation zone.

“An immediate prevention and speedy remedy is desirable for the safety of the public from the apprehended danger of the event of demolition of flats using explosives that have the potential to cause trouble or damage to human life within 200m of the event and that there is sufficient ground for proceeding under Section 144 of CrPC,” said collector S Suhas in his order.

“If anyone contravenes the order, they will be punished under section 188 of IPC that attracts simple imprisonment for a month or fine up to Rs 200 or both; and if such disobedience causes danger to human life or safety or affray, then imprisonment can be up to six months or a fine of up to Rs 1,000 or with both,” the order said.

The decision to impose section 144 was taken after a high-level meeting last week. The meeting emphasised that people residing within 200m of the buildings need to be evacuated and traffic regulation needs to be implemented as part of safety measures.

“Demolition of the four buildings is a challenging task. However, all steps have been taken to ensure that everything goes according to plan. Also ‘plan B’ has been put in place in case of medical emergencies. But, we are hopeful that there will be no unfortunate happening,” the collector said.

Meanwhile, on the request of the city commissioner, the collector has declared an abandoned multi-storied building on the western side of the NH as unsafe and entry to this building has been prohibited.

The district collector said that he has asked muncipal authorities to conduct a cleaning drive after the implosion. “If the situation normalises before the scheduled time, the prohibition order will be lifted before 5pm. Buses for transporting residents to temporary lodging facilities will be available at designated spots from 7.30am. Special attention will be ensured for senior citizens who need medical care,” he said.

Four boats of the Kerala police will be anchored in the backwaters at the boundary of the exclusion zone to prevent other boats from entering the area.

AURANGABAD: No sooner does night befall than a group of people, projecting themselves to be ‘policemen’ and using barricades used by cops, station themselves on the AS Club signal situated on the Waluj-Paithan cross road falling under the limits of MIDC Waluj police station to extort money from truck drivers.

This menace, besides occuring right under the nose of the police, is continuing despite the suspects getting caught once. While accessing the records at MIDC Waluj police station, TOI has found that a few days ago, while an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) was on his nightly patrolling duty, he nabbed the suspects, made a diary entry in the night register of the police control room as well that of the area police station, before handing them over to MIDC Waluj police.

Surprisingly, the suspects were let off without registering an offence or initiating any kind of preventive action against them citing that there was no complaint registered against them. The police inaction on these suspects has raised many eyebrows.

As per the night register of city police control room, ACP (city) H N Bhapkar had mentioned, “While being on night patrolling, three suspects holding torch in their hands and wearing black jackets were spotted waylaying the vehicles coming from Pune and diverting them on left side of road towards Golwadi toll plaza.” The entry also mentions about the suspects forcefully taking money from the truck drivers.

TOI has obtained a copy of the names of suspects who were nabbed by the ACP and handed over to MIDC Waluj police station. Sources claimed that despite being caught, it did not deter the suspects from continuing their illegal activity at the said point between 1am and 5am daily without fail. A police inspector said on the condition of anonymity, “Any person found committing such an act should be booked for robbery, impersonation as government official, if not extortion.”

Aurangabad commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad told TOI, “We have launched a probe into the matter and records are being scanned.”

When contacted, Bhapkar refused to comment on the issue. Policemen at the MIDC Waluj police station as well as the police control room confirmed about the entry made by the officer.

Sources said that the suspects standing at the AS Club signal prevented the vehicles coming from Pune and Paithan road to directly head towards the city via Ahmednagar naka. The suspects either took money from the truck drivers for letting them go towards the city directly. If not, they would force the truck drivers to divert towards Golwadi road and come to Ahmednagar Naka via Cantonment toll plaza. This toll plaza has several cases registered against it for charging several times more toll than the stipulated charges from the truck owners.

A policeman said, “The issue of charging an exorbitant toll from trucks coming from others states is nothing new. Despite registration of offences, the said practice continues at the toll plaza.” According to sources, this menace also occurs at Sharmapaur Phata daily.

KOLHAPUR: Maharashtra Pollution Control Board ’s state member secretary E Ravindran directed the panel appointed by the Bombay high court (HC) and the MPCB ’s local unit to draft a proposal enlisting the measures to stop pollution of Panchganga river.

He also asked the MPCB regional unit to provide portable machines to treat the waste water released from various establishments located at the textile town of Ichalkaranji.

Most of the waste water released from the city is treated at the sewage treatment plants (STPs) set up by the KMC. However, the waste water released from the villages, towns and effluents discharged from the sugar mills and industries is still causing river pollution .

Uday Gaikwad, expert member of the panel said, “The focus needs to be on managing the river flow. If the river flows continuously, the intensity of the pollution is reduced. Also, there is a need to reuse the treated waste water, especially for irrigation. We suggested that small STPs be set up for every three to four villages.”

Porvorim: Panchayats minister Mauvin Godinho on Friday said the department was in the process of amending the Goa Panchayat Raj Act in order to take punitive action against village panchayat office bearers who are found negligent.

The amendments are aimed at holding panchayats accountable for solid waste management and development in the village, said Godinho while speaking to the media.

“At present, the government is not satisfied with the way the panchayats are managing the garbage. In future, some amendments to the Panchayati Raj Act are going to made. In those amendments, we want to bring in a rule that if a panchayat does not manage garbage properly and if there is a threat of diseases due to the garbage problem, then action could be initiated for remission of duty, neglect of duty and non-adherence to garbage rules,” said the minister.

Godinho also announced that the process to recruit additional panchayat secretaries had commenced.

When asked about the government’s move to create a common cadre for panchayats, Godinho said that disparity in the pay structure had thwarted the implementation of the proposal.

“We are in the process of compiling the data on creation of common cadre. Common cadre will be implemented as soon as possible, but the disparity in salaries is one of the issues that we have to sort out. Some panchayats like Candolim and Calangute are rich, while some panchayats need grants,” said the minister.

Asked about the zilla panchayat elections, Godinho said that the notification could be expected on January 15.

He ruled out a fresh delimitation exercise.

Men warm themselves by a fire on a cold winter day in Jaipur (File Photo)

JAIPUR: Cold wave conditions aggravated in the state on Friday when majority of the places witnessed a decline in their minimum and maximum temperatures. Fatehpur remained the coldest in the state with a minimum temperature of minus 1.8°C, the Met reports said.

Attributing the continued dip in mercury to the active northerly winds, Jaipur Met office said that there would be mild rise in the minimum and maximum temperatures across the state.

Jaipurites woke up to another chilly morning as a minimum temperature of 5.2°C was recorded in the city. Even in the afternoon, a minimum temperature of 20.0°C was recorded. The traffic on the highways connecting Jaipur to Agra, Jaipur to Delhi and Jaipur to Ajmer was chaotic due to poor visibility in the morning. The ongoing spell of cold wave conditions has badly affected those who live on the streets. With the revival of the cold wave conditions in the state, huge rush was seen at the night shelters across the city. In the evening, roads wore an empty look as people confined themselves to their homes.

Fatehpur was followed by Churu where a minimum temperature of 1.8°C was recorded, Udaipur 2.4°C, Bikaner 3.8°C, Sriganganagar 4.4°C, Kota 5.0°C, Ajmer 6.0°C, Jodhpur 6.4°C and a minimum temperature of 7.0°C was recorded in Barmer.

Saurabh (left) & Rohit Tiwari

JAIPUR: Police arrested two for the murders of Shweta Tiwari and her 21-month-old son Shreyam in Pratap Nagar on Friday.

The murdered woman’s husband Rohit Tiwari and his friend’s brother-in-law Saurabh Chaudhary are the two who have been arrested by the city police.

Tiwari, who hails from Delhi, had planned the gruesome killings along with Chaudhary, who was paid an advance of Rs 20,000 to execute the crime, police said.

The husband had conspired to kill his wife and son as he wanted to “delete his back history” to get married again. Shweta, who hails from Kanpur, and the infant were bludgeoned to death by the hired killer on December 7.

Rohit paid the killer Rs 20,000 as advance on January 3 at a hotel near the airport. Both the accused have confessed to the crime. A team has been sent to Udaipur as well to detain the husband’s friend who had recommended the killer.

The brutal tale started in December 2019 when 35-year-old Rohit spoke to his friend Hari Singh, who was also his colleague at Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in Udaipur, where he was posted prior to Jaipur.

While talking about his marital issues, Rohit told his friend that he wanted to do away with his wife and son. Singh recommended his own brother-in-law Chaudhary for the task. Chaudhary was also well known to the accused husband.

On December 23, Rohit disconnected the CCTV cameras within his office premises at the Jaipur airport which remained switched off till January 7.

After making up his mind, he got in touch with Chaudhary and they set up a meeting at a hotel on January 3. “The two met and chalked out the plan to kill the mother-son duo. Rohit gave Chaudhary the advance amount as well. They decided that the murder had to be carried out at a time when Rohit is at work so that he has an alibi,” said police commissioner Anand Shrivastav.

On January 5, Rohit and Shweta got into a fight and he thrashed her badly, even threw a heat blower at her. He also called her brother and threatened to kill her. Shweta also threatened to lodge a police case against him if he continued this behaviour.

Two days later, on January 7, Rohit left for work as usual and the same afternoon Chaudhary came to his apartment. Since he was well acquainted with the family, Shweta was not suspicious about Chaudhary’s sudden arrival.

“Chaudhary had tea with Shweta and while she was not looking, he got the pestle stone from the kitchen and hit her on the head multiple times and broke her jaw. After killing her, he went to the other room and strangled the baby before hitting him on the head with the same pestle stone,” elaborated Shrivastav. He had come to the house without any weapon.

However, he did not immediately flee from the scene and waited for 20-25 minutes at Rohit’s house. To further ensure that there were no survivors, he slit Shweta’s throat before leaving the house with the baby’s body which he dumped in the forest area. He also took Shweta’s phone and took out the SIM which he put in another mobile. After this, the killer called and messaged Rohit from his wife’s number, with ransom demands. The ransom demands continued even after the child’s body was found on January 8.

After the murders, Chaudhary roamed around in the city before heading back to his house at night. Though he is a native of Agra, he resided in Sanganer.

Explaining how the case was cracked, Shrivastav said, “We were already questioning Rohit and at the same time our teams of over 200 cops were conducting door-to-door checks and trying to find out who all had visited the family’s flat on the day of the murders and before that. We checked call records as well as conducting continuous recce of the area. Linking the facts together, we zeroed down on Chaudhary and using traditional investigative methods, connected both the accused and arrested them.”

Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati

KOLHAPUR: Rajya Sabha MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati will observe one-day hunger strike at Pune-based Chhatrapati Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research, Training and Human Development Institute (SARTHI) on Saturday.

SARTHI was set up early last year to provide the educational and employment consultancy to the students from Maratha and Maratha-kunabi community. Sambhajiraje received several complaints from the students over poor functioning of the institute located along Agharkar Road.

The MP claimed that few days ago he met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and told him about the situation of the institute. “The CM had assured me that he will attend all the issues once the cabinet expansion takes place. I am going on one-day hunger strike and hundreds of students and activists from the community are going to participate. Since last many months, students are not getting scholarships, the financial aid assured for the students opting for competitive exams has not yet been fulfilled,” said Sambhajiraje.

The institute has been set up on the lines of BARTI (Babasaheb Ambedkar Research and Technical Institution), another Pune based institute which provides training to the backward class students for competitive exams.

409,['11/01/2020'],"FASTag deadline approaches,yet traffic crawls at toll plazas","This story is from January 11, 2020

Bengaluru: With only a few days left for all except one lane at toll plazas on national highways across the country to shift to FASTag-only mode, Karnataka seems to be lagging. While the share of FASTag in total transactions is hovering around 46% in the state, not much is being done to deter motorists without FASTag from straying into the cashless lanes.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) had last month stated that motorists entering FASTag lanes without the stickers will have to pay double the toll. The penalty was expected to force motorists to get FASTags instead of paying double toll or spending time in long queues on manual toll fee lanes.

However, only seven of the 37 toll plazas on national highways in Karnataka are levying the double toll. Only about 3,000 such cases have been booked between December 15 and January 7 and Rs 3.15 lakh has been collected as penalty by National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) from FASTag lane violators.

The double toll is being collected only at Nelamangala, Belur, Hejamady, Sasthan, Talapady, Brahamarkotlu and Suratkal toll plazas.

As predicted by the central ministry, the FASTag system has not been successful in reducing the waiting time at toll plazas in the state, motorists allege. Besides, system errors and glitches continue to affect the smooth rollout of the system in the state, they allege.

“I was travelling through the Sadahalli toll plaza near the airport recently when the system failed to detect my FASTag. The FASTag scanner there is unable to read stickers sometimes. Authorities should solve these issues before rolling out the system. This is leading to congestion in the FASTag lanes as well,” said Dipti A, a commuter.

Other motorists also pointed to double debits at a few toll plazas where toll operators collect cash from commuters citing glitches in the reader, after which the amount also gets debited automatically.

NHAI, Karnataka officials have expressed concern over whether the system will be rolled out without glitches, come January 15. While raising doubts about achieving the 100% FASTag toll collection goal by January 15, they have once again requested cabs to make the switch to FASTags.

“Although the race to buy FASTags has not picked up pace yet, right before the January 15 deadline, we expect to see another bout of people scrambling to buy FASTags,” said an NHAI official.

Earlier, all but one lane at toll plazas had to become FASTag-enabled by December 1, 2019. The Centre put off the implementation date to December 15, before postponing it again to January 15, 2020.

410,['11/01/2020'],Part of Goa’s SWR route to be ready by March next yr,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Margao: The South Western Railway (SWR) has set March 2021 as the tentative target to make the Margao-Sanvordem double-tracked route operational. Once accomplished, the partial Goa stretch will be the first to be made functional. It is part of the ongoing Hospet-Hubli-Tinaighat-Vasco double-tracking project.

Rail Vikas Nikas Ltd GM Sashibhushan Sahoo told TOI that the trial run of the route will be conducted by March this year. “We have completed over 75% of double-tracking on the Margao-Sanvordem stretch. We are awaiting a clearance from the National Wildlife Board to start work on the Castle Rock-Collem stretch. While we are aiming to operationalise the Margao-Sanvordem route by March 2021, the Sanvordem-Kalay stretch is likely to be completed by June-December 2021,” Sahoo said.

South Goa collector Ajit Roy on Thursday held a review meeting with senior officials of the district administration over SWR’s double-tracking project, particularly with regard to opposition to land acquisition by the locals between the Majorda and Vasco railway stations. “There are some bottlenecks in this stretch and we are working things out,” Roy told TOI.

“A notice inviting tenders has been issued for the 17-km Majorda-Vasco stretch,” Sahoo said. “We have fixed three-year time frame to complete this stretch.”

Signalling its intent to fast-track the project, the railways ministry has notified the Hospet-Hubli-Tinaigat-Vasco doubling project in Goa as the ‘special railway project’ which, Sahoo said, would facilitate the Indian Railways to acquire land under the Railways Act, 1989 in areas where the state government has failed to do so. The ministry has also notified road over-bridge (ROB) projects at Xelvon, Nessai and Cansaulim as special railway projects.

Under the Railways Act, a special project refers to one notified by the central government “for providing national infrastructure for a public purpose in a specified time frame”. The notification will come into effect from the date it is published in the Gazette.

CHENNAI: This time last year, driving out of Chennai you would be greeted by barren brown fields as the city and its suburbs faced a drought-like situation after the monsoon failed in 2018. Now these same areas are a sea of green as farmers in Avadi, Poonamallee, Chitlapakkam and Tiruporur have planted paddy to cash in on the rains of 2019, which have left their wells and tanks brimming.Kancheepuram and Chengalpet districts have a total of 924 tanks, and most of them are filled to the brim. The result? The area under paddy and other crops has shot up.Data sourced by TOI from the agriculture department shows that 3,475 hectares are currently under crop across Chitlapakkam, Kattankulathur and Tiruporur blocks of Chengalpet district. This is 500 acres more than in 2017, when the suburb received a similar quantum of rain .In neighbouring Tiruvallur district, the area under crop has risen by a few thousand hectares in villages adjoining the city. Official data recorded till December 2019 showed farming was on in full swing in Avadi, Poonamallee, Minjur and Sholavaram blocks, spread across nearly 38,000 hectares. Of this, 88% constitutes paddy, while pulses, millets and oil seeds make up the rest. “In the next three months, the total area under cultivation would cross the 45,800 acres recorded in 2016-17,” said an agriculture department official at Tiruvallur.Agriculture department sources said a bumper harvest was in the offing as the suburbs recorded the right amount of rainfall, neither excess nor deficit. The areas have recorded a new high in area under crop since 2015, when floods swept clean some of these agrarian pockets.N Ramesh, a 67-year-old farmer from Mambakkam near Tambaram, said around 300 acres had been cultivated this year in his village. Neighbouring villages such as Ponmar also saw an increase in area under cultivation. “The main encouragement for farmers to take up cultivation despite shortage of farmhands and increase in fertilizer prices was the availability of adequate water. We expect a decent harvest without monetary losses this time,” he said.Pinning hope on good returns, farmers in Tiruvallur have brought in workers from Vijayawada and Machilipatnam in Andhra Pradesh. Dhananchezhiyan, a farmer from Thirunelai near Redhills, said, “The workers come in groups, stay for a month for sowing. Despite all the toil, farmers get barely reasonable returns while middlemen and traders pocket all the profit.”.Farmers in Sholavaram and Minjur blocks have raised concerns over pest attack. Dhananchezhiyan said several hundred hectares of paddy had been hit by brown plant hopper attack. “This will reduce yield to 19 bags per acre from 36 bags. The total harvest will, however, match last year’s yield as the cultivated area has increased,” he added.Agriculture department officials said farmers in Tiruvallur had chosen a paddy variety susceptible to pest attack. “We suggested TKM 13, a variety that can sustain in different climatic conditions and is less vulnerable to pest attack. But farmers preferred BPT 5024, which attracts better market rates,” the official said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73197580,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1565718,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rain-paints-citys-suburbs-green/articleshow/73196600.cms

Representative image

AURANGABAD: The in-charge of Mangrulpeer police station of Washim district, Vinod Dighore, has been arrested by Nanded police under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) for his alleged connections with the notorious Rinda Gang.

The kingpin of the gang, Dilpreet Rinda, is wanted by police in different parts of the country, especially Maharashtra and Punjab. He has 17 offences registered against him in Nanded, while 25 offences are registered in different parts of Punjab.

Dighore was produced before the special MCOCA court on Friday and has been remanded in seven-day police custody.

According to sources, the suspect was part of the special squad of Nanded police’s local crime branch that was formed to arrest Rinda. At that time Dighore was an assistant inspector.

The hardened criminal, who has a bounty of several lakhs on his head, is accused of murder, extortion and kidnapping.

He is known for posting his photographs on Facebook with sophisticated firearms including AK-47. The criminal with suspected links to banned terror outfits from Punjab is also on the radar of the anti-terror squad (ATS).

Nanded superintendent of police Vijaykumar Magar told TOI, “While working on the Govind Kokulwar attempt to murder case, technical analysis revealed Dighore’s connection with Rinda gang following which he has been arrested.”

Expressing displeasure over an officer’s alleged connection with a wanted criminal, Magar said there is barely anything on record to show Dighore was in touch with the criminal as part of his assigned job to nail the criminal.

On August 17, 2019, Kokulwar — a Congress leader and former corporator known for his proximity to incumbent PWD minister Ashok Chavan — was shot at. Probing the case, the Nanded police managed to arrest six accused including Viru Bhandari, a key man of Rinda gang.

Investigation revealed that the firing was the result of a futile attempt by Rinda gang to extort money from Kokulwar.

The probe also pointed out that after learning about Kokulwar getting extortion calls, the officer instead of registering an offence and providing security, kept the information under wraps and allegedly remained in touch with members of Rinda gang.

Authorities informed that Dighore has a tainted service record and he has faced departmental actions in the form of suspension, stopping of increments and so on.

He joined as constable in the police department in Nagpur, before cracking inter-departmental exam and becoming a police sub-inspector and serving in Nagpur during the initial years.

National Green Tribunal

KOLHAPUR: After five years of regular hearings, the National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) has finally disposed the petition filed by a city based activist over pollution of Rankala lake and Panchganga river.

During a hearing held on Tuesday, the NGT found that the progress made by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) to stop pollution of both the waterbodies is satisfactory.

The NGT also referred to the report submitted by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board ( MPCB ) which claimed that around 95% of the waste water generated in the city has been brought under treatment and only miniscule amount is currently released into the river.

Sunil Kemble, the petitioner, said, “The NGT in its last hearing maintained that the KMC has been able to get most of the waste water generated in the city treated. Works of diversion of nullahs is in the last stage of completion and soon most of the waste water will be released into the river only after treatment. I am satisfied that with my petition the issue of pollution was taken seriously.”

The filed petition initially objected to the works proposed to rejuvenate Rankala lake. The NGT earlier had observed that the proposed works should be scrapped as the works will not help much on addressing the pollution of the lake.

Instead, the court directed the KMC to speed up the pending work of Dudhali-based sewage treatment plant, obstruct the flow of sewage directly entering the lake. Accordingly a year ago, the KMC finally managed to commission the STP. In subsequent hearings, the issue of pollution of Panchganga river was raised and the directions were given to the KMC time-to-time.

A senior KMC official said, “The MPCB was asked to conduct third party audit of the works undertaken by us. According to MPCB, we have managed to bring 95% of waste water under the treatment system. The court is satisfied with our efforts and therefore disposed the petition. We are committed to treatment of 100% of waste water and in following days various other measures will be taken to ensure that every drop of waste water entering the river is treated.”

Porvorim: Following the January 1 circular restricting panchayats from issuing construction and occupancy approvals, the panchayat department has now issued a fresh circular with guidelines for large residential or commercial projects to approach Block Development Officers (BDOs) for the necessary approvals, said panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho.

The minister said that the intention of the fresh guidelines is to streamline the approval process and to ensure that real estate firms comply with solid waste management rules.

“Panchayats have no expertise to deal with garbage disposal; as a result, we have to send our technical people from the BDO to check if they have implemented scientific methods of garbage management or not,” said the minister.

He said that the purpose of the two circulars has been misunderstood by the village panchayats. Several panchayat office-bearers had held a meeting a few days earlier, slamming the government for trying to override the powers of the panchayats.

Speaking to the media on Friday, Godinho blamed the ‘lethargic’ steps taken by the panchayats for the government’s decision to intervene in the matter.

“I have seen that most of the panchayats are lethargic in picking up and maintaining cleanliness. Efforts being made are not as we expected, and the high court is breathing down our necks. It is our responsibility since we are the ones who have to file affidavits in court,” the minister said.

He then went on to explain that the change in the approval process was necessary in order to ensure that the courts did not issue a halt on construction in the state.

Presently, out of the 191 village panchayats, 87 villages have applied for funds to set up the material recovery facilities (MRF) while 67 village panchayats have identified sites to setup MRF facilities.

Jaipur: The high-powered committee set up under senior cabinet minister BD Kalla to study the demand for liquor prohibition has ruled it out.

In its meeting on Friday, the committee, which included representatives of NGOs, said efforts would be made to reduce consumption of alcohol by creating awareness among people by highlighting its bad effects.

The minister said the government would take steps to reduce alcohol consumption, but no prohibition.

Kalla said full prohibition is in force in Gujarat and Bihar, but the experience of the ban in Gujarat was not good. Liquor is easily available there, he said. However, the department and NGO officials will visit Gujarat and Bihar to see the situation. “I can say with certainty that there will be no prohibition in Rajasthan.” He said the government had sent an official team to Bihar to study the effectiveness of the measure there. Now a team would be sent to Gujarat as well. The NGO representatives would also be made part of the delegation so that they could get first-hand information.

On the new liquor policy, Kalla said heritage hotels and historic buildings, which are frequented by foreign tourists, would be given liquor licenses. Apart from this, no new licenses will be issued, he said. The meeting was attended among others included medical and health minister Raghu Sharma, ACS (Home) Rajiv Swaroop, Excise Commissioner Vishnu Charan Malik, Finance Secretary Revenue Dr Prithvi, Pooja Chhabra associated with liquor ban drive. tnn

KOLKATA: Cabin No. 12.5 at SSKM Hospitals’ Woodburn ward remains under lock and key for most part of the year, except for cleaning early every morning. But hectic sprucing has been on over the past few weeks, as the hospital authorities will keep it ready for the weekend in case Prime Minister Narendra Modi requires any medical care during his visit to the city.

Since 2011, the cabin has been reserved for treatment for the PM, covered under Special Protection Group, which provides proximate security to the Prime Minister. According to the protocol, there has to be a health facility, with a special set-up, close to the place, where the PM stays overnight, in case the need arises. After arriving in the city on Saturday, Modi will stay the night at Raj Bhawan. Given its proximity, Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGMER), better known as SSKM Hospital , has been chosen. The special security force will on Saturday take guard outside the cabin, which will again be shut once Modi leaves on Sunday.

“Following protocols, we are keeping the all facilities ready, including the special cabin at Woodburn ward, a medical team and an ambulance,” said IPGMER medical superintend and vice-principal Raghunath Misra. A team of doctor, comprising specialists in medicine, cardiology, anaesthesia and surgery, has been constituted. They will be backed by a team of technicians and nursing staff. A critical-care ambulance, complete with emergency care, and units of blood, matching that of Modi, will be kept on standby. Cabin 12.5 has four rooms, a retiring room, an examination room for patients, complete with portable gadgets, a dining room and an ante-chamber.

The hospital was founded way back in 1707. Initially built for the Europeans till 1770, the facility was known as Presidency Hospital. It was later named Presidency General Hospital or P G Hospital and in 1954, renamed Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital. The Woodburn ward was built between 1902 and 1908. Since 13 is considered unlucky, the cabin, flanked by 6 rooms on each side, became No. 12.5 when the British built it. The nomenclature continues.

The cabin had earlier been used by many ministers but since 2011, it has been reserved for VVIPs under SPG protection. Currently, only PM is covered by the special force. “No one protected by the SPG has had the need to be in the cabin in the recent past. We hope the occasion does not arise for Modi either. But no one knows. So, the hospital is keeping everything ready,” said a senior official at the hospital.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: AICC general secretary Oommen Chandy said that the agitation against Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), which has spread across the country, has to succeed as the legislation has “thrown an open a challenge to the country’s secular credentials”.

“The ongoing agitations are to protect our democratic values and secular credentials. Hence, we cannot lose the battle against the challenge which has been thrown open by BJP and Sangh Parivar,” Chandy said. He was speaking at the function organized to conclude the 24-hour fast by former KPCC president M M Hassan before Raj Bhavan.

“If the agitation fails, then it would mean that the 130 crore people of the country have lost their battle. Our democracy and secularism cannot be surrendered before Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. They have come up with the Act with an aim to communally divide the country,” said Chandy.

“People have the right to dissent. But Modi-Shah combine is silencing dissenting voices using police, which is totally unjustifiable,” he said.

The former chief minister also slammed governor Arif Mohammed Khan for “advocating CAA with more vigour than BJP”. “His words and actions do not suit the position he holds. No governor in the country has come out supporting CAA like Khan. He has more enthusiasm than BJP leaders,” Chandy added.

Police arrive for duty a day before the demolition of apartment complexes

MARADU: The district administration and other departments concerned should consider cleaning up of the Vembanad lakebed in the region as the mixing of debris generated from the demolition of four illegal apartment complexes may lead to variation in the pH value of the water, said Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (Kufos) vice-chancellor A Ramachandran.

He said that even a slight variation in the pH value of water may seriously affect the fish population in the lakebed. “In case of any heavy debris falling in the lake, it should be removed as early as possible,” he said.

“Fish tend to migrate for survival. If a portion of the debris fall in the nearby lake, the aquatic species will migrate to a safer place. But if the blocks of heavy concrete debris remained in the lakebed forever, it may lead to severe ecological problems. So, the district administration as well as the state government should act promptly to clear the huge from the lake as early as possible,” he said.

Meanwhile, experts said that geological impact of the controlled implosions must be studied. “There is no cause for panic as the expected tremor due to the blasts will be of the magnitude of 2 and 3 in the Richter scale,” said K T Damodaran, geologist, and former director of school of marine sciences, Cochin University of Science and Technology. “It may cause just a jerk in the surrounding buildings which may lead to minor vibrations and rattling of the window panes,” he said.

“As the demolition will be carried out by controlled implosions and it is up to the ground level, there is a remote chance for tremor,” said K N Krishnakumar, deputy director, Collegiate Education, Kottayam.

PANAJI: To combat the increasing cases of rent-a-bike and rent-a-car thefts in the city, Panaji police have turned to a messaging app.

Police have created a group on the messaging app and added all Panaji-based rent-a-bike and rent-a-car operators and directed them to upload photographs and identity proofs of their customer to help them check for any criminal records using the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS).

During the last couple of days several rent-a-bike and rent-a-car theft cases have been reported at the Panaji police station, Panaji PI Sudesh Naik told TOI. Among those who have reported thefts are also those who rented their private two- and four-wheelers, he said.

In many cases, police said they had found that those hiring the vehicle had submitted fake id proofs. In some other cases, police found that the vehicle had been abandoned.

Panaji police on Friday held a meeting with rent-a-bike and rent-a-car owners during which they cautioned them from renting out vehicles without collecting photographs and identity proofs from customers as the data is of vital importance in case need to track someone arises. Police asked rent-a-car and rent-a-bike operators to strictly maintain a register with identity details of all their clients.

CHENNAI: There weren’t any gang wars, communal conflicts or dacoities, but Chennai recorded the third highest number of murders in 2018 among the country’s metros .Personal enmity and petty quarrels accounted for more than half the murders, pushing the number up by 11% in one year, according to the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau.The 172 murders in Chennai in 2018 come behind Delhi’s 416 and Bengaluru’s 218. Mumbai stood fourth with 164.Until 2016, most metros recorded a decline in murders, but some like Chennai have seen a steady increase. While, 27% of the murders were due to enmity, 23% of them were because of petty quarrels. About 18% of the murders were crimes of passion over extramarital relationships or love affairs.Police commissioner A K Viswanathan said, “We can curtail murders by improving the police patrolling in the neighbourhood. They can also be reduced by focussing more to get conviction in all cases, which will play a deterrent role.”Data gathered from the state’s ambulance service and from city hospitals reveals the details about the incidence of murderous attacks. Two of five patients brought into the emergency department across the state with traumatic injuries is a victim of assault, according to data available with the Tamil Nadu Accident and Trauma Initiative. For instance, of 764 admissions on January 8, there were 321 cases of assault, 482 road accident victims and 623 falls.The ratio isn’t very different for city hospitals, say health department officials. Assault cases include a wide range of cases from drunken brawls to petty quarrels and fisticuffs. The mortality in assault cases is not as high as road accidents, where injured are at risk of death. “In most fights, the injury is not big. But when the motive is to kill, the patients suffer grevious wounds and risk of death in these cases is also higher,” said Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital dean Dr R Jayanthi. On January 8, while an assault victim died in the hospital, there were nine road accident deaths.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73197581,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-627150,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kill-zone-city-3rd-among-metros-in-18/articleshow/73196577.cms

KOCHI: The chief minister called on the opposition to stand together as a single force to get the Centre to withdraw the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ).

Speaking after inaugurating the Bharanagatana Samrakshana Sangamam to protest against CAA, the chief minister called on all political parties including the main opposition to set aside their party internal squabbles and join hands in the protests against the communal agenda of the Sangh Parivar .

Equating the stand taken by the RSS to divide India based on religious grounds, he said that this has been their agenda as they wanted the country to become like Germany. “We all know the Germany of those days which was led by Hitler and his annhilation of the Jews. Similarly, the RSS and the Sangh Parivar are against the Muslims, Christians and Communists,” he said.

He said that the CAA protests are similar to the freedom struggle which saw the youth come out in large numbers as all campuses are erupting with protests. “What is happening in JNU has shocked the nation but the students have already said that they would continue to protests despite being attacked by goons and police,” said the CM.

“India was a highly respected country in the world because of its democratic values but today there is no nation in the world that has not expressed its displeasure over the happenings in the last couple of months,” Vijayan said

AMARAVATI: The YSRC cadres are worried that a staunch TDP supporter was able to get near chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy several times in the last few weeks.

According to sources said VKS Reddy from Kurnool district found Bandaru Saidarao from Chandarlapadu village in Nandigama constituency moving in the CM’s inner circle in the last few days. Rao was seen behind the CM during Amma Vodi public meeting held in Chittoor on Thursday.

According to Reddy, Rao is a staunch TDP follower in Nandigama constituency in Krishna district. Saida Rao, who worked as an outsourcing employee in the secretariat during the TDP regime, gained entry into the CM’s close circle. Reddy retrieved many of Saida Rao’s video posts on social media backing TDP and Chandrababu Naidu.

Rao was also seen lashing out at YS Jagan in his video-posts on social media. He was also seen making critical comments against Jagan after an attempt on his life was made in Visakhapatnam airport before the elections.

Several of his posts were directly linked to CBN army, TDP’s youth wing.

“I don’t know whether he is still working in the secretariat or somewhere else. I am not even demanding to oust him from his job. I am concerned about our chief minister’s safety,” said VKS Reddy in his message to the top YSRC leadership.

Sources said the YSRC leadership has launched a probe into the alleged security breach. It is not clear whether they have brought the issue to the notice of police and security personnel. YSRC cadre are worried about the safety of the chief minister especially after the attempt made on Jagan before the elections.

They are afraid that someone might try to harm the chief minister in the wake of his plans to shift the capital city from Amaravati.

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay High Court has issued notices to the officials of cooperative department, police and office-bearers of a defunct cooperative housing society that continued to function despite cancellation of its registration.

Col Pawan Kumar Sharma (retd.) approached the high court through lawyer NL Jadhav, seeking directions to the police to register an FIR against office-bearers of the dissolved KDR Farms Cooperative Housing Society for allegedly misrepresenting facts involving a high court order.

As per Sharma’s petition, the housing society was wrongfully claiming that were carrying out works in the KDR Farms premises, spread across 17 acre on the outskirts of the city, with orders from the high court. In fact, the court had ordered a status quo and disallowed them to carry out works.

The petitioner contended that he had bought the plot by registered sale deed on October 1, 2003, but the builder had failed to provide amenities he had promised. “However, in collusion with some second-hand purchasers of the plots at the KDR Farms, the builder illegally registered a cooperative housing society,” Sharma said.

The petitioner had challenged this and accordingly the divisional registrar of cooperative society cancelled the registration of the society in January 2011. It was challenged by one of the respondents Rajendra Kulkarni, before the then cooperative minister, who rejected his plea.

Chairman of the defunct society and Kulkarni challenged the divisional registrar’s decision and minister’s verdict before the court in December 2015 on which the court ordered status quo.

Still an advertisement was published in newspapers by the society in January 2019 inviting tenders to repair the road which cannot be done as the society was not in existence.

Following the petition, the bench comprising justices TV Nalawade and SM Gavhane ordered issuance of notices to the seven respondents, including the government, police and the officials of the cooperative department and the two office-bearers of the defunct society returnable on January 14.

Nagpur: The Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will reopen the shooting of Pandharkawda tigress T1 or Avni by setting up a special investigating team (SIT) to look into the lapses that led to the killing.

Talking to TOI on Friday, housing minister Jitendra Awhad said, “Though the structure of SIT has not been decided, we have asked forest minister Sanjay Rathod to do the needful as there is demand by the aggrieved parties.”

“Three days ago, wildlife lover and Nagpur-based Dr Jerryl Banait had submitted a memorandum to me. He also met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and environment minister Aditya Thackeray and apprised them of the lapses. Chief minister too has agreed to the demand,” said Awhad.

Forest minister Sanjay Rathod from Shiv Sena, who was on tour of his constituency in Digras, was not available for comments. Forest ministry too was clueless about the demand.

“We have no intimation in this regard. The report submitted by chief wildlife warden on the issue is pending with state’s law and judiciary ministry for its opinion in the matter,” said Mantralaya officials.

Top sources said Rathod, who hails from Yavatmal, is reluctant to set up an SIT, may be fearing people’s wrath as there was huge resentment among villagers against Avni, charged with killing 13 people in 18 months.

Dr Banait confirmed he met Thackerays and housing minister Awhad to demand action against Hyderabad-based sharpshooter Asghar Ali Khan, who was not authorized to shoot Avni.

“It was only in the presence of his father Shafat Ali Khan in whose name permit was issued by chief wildlife warden. Shafat was absent when Avni was shot on the night of November 2, 2018,” said Banait.

Detailed investigations by the NTCA and state-level committees have submitted that Asghar violated Arms Act, 1958, Indian Veterinary Council Act (IVCA) 1984, Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, while shooting T1.

Former forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar had promised that if these committees indicted Asghar, action will be taken. However, even 26 months later no action has been taken either by the state government or NTCA. The Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) has gone a step ahead by giving a clean chit to Asghar.

NTCA member-secretary Anup Kumar Nayak said, “We have sent several reminders seeking reply from the state government and PCCF (wildlife) but there is no response.”

Dignitaries at the international meet on ‘Advances in Mechanical Engineering’ organized at VNIT, on Friday

Nagpur: It is important for teachers to do research so that they could provide quality education to students and give them an insight into various subjects to acquire new skills, said BS Murty, director of Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, on Friday.

He was speaking as the chief guest at the inauguration of two-day ‘International conference on advances in mechanical engineering (ICAME 2020)’ organized as part of the 60th anniversary celebrations of Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT). Chairman of board of governors of VNIT Vishram Jamdar presided while director Pramod Padole was the guest of honour.

Murty said, “I observed that teaching is not given the important it deserves as compared to research. Therefore teaching, coupled with research, will go a long way in guiding students in an efficient manner. Research helps in understanding the subject better and therefore teachers should pursue it.”

Jamdar said as the topic of the conference suggested, it is more relevant in current times to contribute to rapid progress mechanical engineering is doing. “I remember the days when mechanical engineering was just about producing machines and mechanical products. But with the changing times, mechanical engineering has assumed greater important in development,” he said.

In his keynote address, Slovakia Peter Monka, professor at Technical University of Kosice, spoke on manufacturing trends as drivers.

Mark King, reader in sports biomechanics and associate dean for enterprise at School of Sport Exercise and Health Sciences at Loughborough University, laid emphasis on optimizing sports performance.

Padole said the institute is entering the 60th year and various events and activities pertaining to teaching, which includes synergy and research, industry-institute interaction, are part of the celebrations.

On Saturday, Jaydeep Balakrishnan, associate dean of faculty support, College of Business Administration, California State University, Sacramento (USA), will speak on ‘21st century ethical business entrepreneurship: A Gandhian perspective’.

Nitin Pangarkar, associate professor, strategy and policy, National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School, will speak on ‘Strategies for building a productive research career’.

At the outset, organizing secretary Shital Chiddarwar proposed a vote of thanks.

KOLKATA: Flights arriving in Kolkata during a 20-30 minute period on Saturday late afternoon will be kept on hold to allow a buffer for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s safe passage. Departing flights will also be on hold during the period. On Sunday late morning and afternoon, when Modi departs from the city, other flights may be held back for a while as well.Sources said the security enhancement would begin much before Air India One touches down at Kolkata airport. As the Embrair jet approaches Kolkata, the distance between it and other passenger flights arriving at the airport will be increased to twice the usual distance maintained between flights. Even during the journey, the PM aircraft will be assigned an altitude with a minimum gap of 2,000ft with other planes.On touchdown, the plane will be taken to a bay next to the old domestic terminal, at least 500m away from the other bays where planes are parked. Here, the PM will either take his BMW 7 Series limousine and exit through gate no. 4 or hop into an Mi-17V-5 helicopter to travel to Race Course.“When the PM accepts greetings from dignitaries at the airport, the area will be cordoned off and vehicular movement in the apron area, including passenger coaches and ground support equipment, will be restricted. The security protocol will lead to some delays in flight operations,” the source said.Flight operations are expected to resume shortly after PM leaves the airport. Though a chopper can take off from the parking bay, given the PM’s elaborate security detail, the Indian Air Force chopper will taxi to the runway before flying off. Flights will be allowed to depart from Kolkata shortly after the helicopter takes off as they will head in different directions: passenger flights will take towards Madhyamgram and PM’s chopper will head southward for Race Course via Salt Lake.However, if he takes the road, traffic along the route will be halted and allowed to resume only when the convoy is 3km away. Roads could be blocked for 15-20 minutes, leading to logjams that could last upto 40-45 minutes. Airlines have urged passengers taking flights between 3pm and 5pm to start at least two additional hours at hand to prevent missing flights owing to road blockades. Passengers arriving in flights between 3.30pm and 4.30pm are also likely to encounter commute delays.On Sunday late morning-afternoon, flights will be halted as soon as PM boards the chopper at Race Course as it will take the same flight path as other incoming aircraft. Flight operations are likely to remain suspended till after PM’s flight departs the city. “There may be longer delays of upto an hour due to the VIP movement,” the official said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73198880,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-777065,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/expect-flight-delays-as-modi-flies-in-today/articleshow/73195882.cms

JAIPUR: After replacing Bhamashah card with ‘Jan Aadhaar card’, now the state IT department had proposed yet another ‘ smart card ’, for every citizen on the lines of centre’s Aadhaar card. The Jan Aadhaar card in place of Bhamashah card considers each family as a unit, while individual card issued to the citizen would help to keep track on individual beneficiary schemes as all beneficiary schemes are going online with direct cash benefits.

This card would be used for all government individual beneficiary schemes, including scholarships, pension, health insurance etc. This exercise would also help the state government to create a separate database of its citizens as the Central government’s Aadhaar database is not shared with the states, sources privy to the development said. Such database will come handy to the government to formulate new policy and programmes.

According to sources, the proposal has been sent to the finance department and the IT department is awaiting the green signal. Another reason for mooting a separate smart card for citizen is ration cards under the public distribution system in the state is set for a revision. The government plans to switch to smart ration cards replacing the existing paper cards in the form of books.

The department could integrate the smart ration cards with the new cards so that it could serve both the purposes.

Representative image

AURANGABAD: A city-based man was duped of Rs 2.5 crore on the pretext of getting hefty returns on the investments made for supplying spare parts to National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ).

One of the five accused, identified as Abhijit Vijay Pansare, was arrested from the city. Articles, including an identity card claiming to be of an IPS officer currently posted with the Prime Minister’s Office and serving with the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), has been recovered from his possession.

The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the city police, carrying out a discreet probe for days, have registered an offence against five people, including two women and a lawyer. In the offence registered with the Cidco police station, the suspects have been booked on the charges of criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy.

In addition, the suspects have also been slapped with various sections of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (In Financial Establishments) Act, 1999.

Citing contents of the complaint, EOW inspector Shrikant Navle said that the suspects were introduced to the complainant Sharad Gawli, an architect by profession, through a common friend.

It was Pansare who reportedly claimed that his firm M/s Science Kudos has bagged a contract for manufacturing RRC reactor of five megawatts, but lacked finance to complete the contract.

To win the architect’s trust, the suspect even produced forged contract papers, work orders and signed cheques. Falling prey to the trap, Gawli gave money to the suspect.

EOW authorities said that the entire transaction took place between October 20, 2016, and October 12, 2017. It was days after the promised deadline for getting hefty returns on the investment made that Gawli began following up with the suspect. However, he only got evasive replies.

After years of persuasion to get back his money, Gawli recently reached out to the commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad and lodged a written complaint in this regard. Considering the gravity of the case, the matter was handed over to the EOW which carried out a detailed probe before registering an offence against the suspects.

Following the recovery of the forged identity cards from the suspects, EOW is probing if the suspects have duped any more people using similar modus operandi.

Residents have no option but to hold cremations in this open plot next to the Dammaiguda lake

HYDERABAD: Residents of over 50 colonies under the Dammaiguda Municipality limits are finding it difficult to get a decent resting place for their dear departed. With the municipality failing to provide a crematorium and a burial ground, families are forced to conduct the final rites in an open and undemarcated plot next to the Dammaiguda lake.

As if their fight for better roads and water supply over the past many years wasn’t enough, residents also have to struggle for a proper cremation/burial of the departed. The grieving families have to shed social inhibitions and other factors, and conduct cremations in the open piece of land.

“People burn dead bodies in the open in the middle of a residential area,” said Venkata Subba Rao, a resident of Sunshine Colony. “Family members are seen sitting on the road until the final rituals are completed. It’s a sad view for every commuter using the lake road.”

The road leading to the make-shift crematorium is also in a pathetic condition. It turns worse in the monsoon. The road turns muddy and inaccessible, and it becomes difficult for people to conduct the final rites of the deceased in the open.

Over the past few years, multiple representations seeking crematorium or a burial ground have been submitted by the residents of Sunshine Colony, Aditya Nagar, MLR Colony, Vedadri Nagar, and VMS Homes among others. Few residents had also approached the Central Pollution Control Board to prevent the burning of dead bodies in an open plot.

Adding to the misery is the Jawahar Nagar dump yard, which has polluted air, water and soil in the area. Balaji, resident of Aditya Nagar, said: “Foul smell engulfs the area due to burning of dead bodies. With the Jawahar Nagar dump yard stench, it only adds to our miseries. While people are fighting for clean water and clean soil, we are fighting for clean air.”

According to residents, the municipality had allocated 0.5 gunthas of land near the Jawahar Nagar dump yard. In November 2019, officials of Dammaiguda Municipality had also assured to resolve the cremation ground issue within 15 days. However, till date, there has been no progress on construction of a crematorium or burial ground in the vicinity.

Trichy: The drinking water dispensing ATM facility installed on West Boulevard (WB) road is yet to be opened to the public even as the work on it was completed by the local body a few months ago.

Trichy Corporation, in its 2019-20 budget, has planned to set up 70 such water dispensers across the city to make drinking water accessible at a reasonable price. The project was supposed to be executed under public-private partnership (PPP) model initially at 43 spots. The contractor will be responsible for maintaining the water purifier for a period of 10 years apart from collecting money, while the corporation would bear the cost of installing borewells.

The local body identified the Marakkadai overhead water tank (OHT) complex on WB road to commission the city’s first water ATM in July 2019 at a cost of 5 lakh. Although the work on it was completed a couple of months back, the ATM is yet to be unveiled.

People can collect one litre of water in bottles by dropping one rupee coin in the ATM while for collecting 20 litres of treated water in the cans they should purchase a rechargeable smart card. The delay is also causing losses for the contractor. “Civil work on two water ATMs including at Marakkadai OHT complex and near Main guard gate is complete. Soon we will open them for public use,” an official said, while refusing to share the reason for the delay.

Private agencies charge 30 for a 20 litre water can while the civic body will offer the same amount of water for just 7. Residents will have to bring their own containers. The smart cards, which can be recharged, were planned to be issued at free of cost at the ATMs.

Even as the state government had been demanding the centre to release funds for the payment of wages to the MNGREGA workers, due since October 2, the centre had said that they were not being able to pay the wages due to lack of funds. The due amount has already gone up to Rs 864 crore in the state. Apart from wages, material component amounting to Rs 1,026 crore is also due. The remaining Rs 910 crore will be used for running the scheme till March 2020.

According to sources, out of Rs 60,000 crore budget allotted for the MGNREGA scheme, the centre has already spent Rs 57,500 crore. ""They (the centre) had released Rs 95 crore. But this amount is very less. This will cover the farmers' wages for five days only,"" a MGNREGA official had said. The state’s Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) department, having already crossed the target of generating 23 crore persondays, having achieved 24 crore mandays by December 2019, the centre had revised the labour budget to 30 crore persondays for the financial year 2019-20, sanctioning an additional fund of nearly Rs 1,500 crore.

Earlier, chief minister Ashok Gehlot had also written to union minister for rural development Narendra Singh Tomar requesting him to release the funds for the payment of wages to the MGNREGA workers.

KOLKATA: We have heard of doctors being booked for medical negligence. This time it is a veterinary doctor who has been booked for medical negligence during the treatment of a pet dog by the West Bengal Veterinary Council ( WBVC ). The council has decided to cancel Subhas Sarkar’s licence for six months and asked him to surrender his registration certificate. He will not be able to to practise in this period.In the beginning of last year, the council got a complaint from Rebanta and Manisha Bhattacharya that their pet Liza had died while being treated by Sarkar. The pet’s parents from Kolkata’s TN Chaterjee Street alleged that the beagle died due to sheer negligence by the vet. The council started an inquiry upon getting the complaint. A team of veterinary doctors, who probed the treatment of Liza, found lapses on the part of Sarkar. He was called to the council’s office in Belgachhia several times during the hearing and was given the opportunity to defend himself. But Sarkar failed to turn up. On July 31, 2019, Sarkar was also asked to reply to the charges of guilt and professional negligence. But the council didn’t get any reply.Consequently, WBVC, in its meeting held on November 29, 2019, found Sarkar guilty of violating standard professional code of ethics. On January 6, the council decided to struck off the vet’s registration for six months starting from January 10. “It was an unanimous decision taken by the board after a through probe,” said WBVC registrar, Ananda Mohan Chandra.When contacted, Sarkar claimed to be not aware of any such verdict against him. He added that he did not want to speak about the case. “I am not aware of such a decision against me. I am yet to get any communication from WBVC,” he said.The verdict by the council has been lauded by pet lovers. They feel that actions like this would instil a sense of fear and responsibility in veterinary doctors. “Animals also feel pain but they cannot express it in words like humans.

KOCHI: “Every time I pass by Alfa Serene, I feel as if I am at a house where someone has died. It is painful to think that the towers would come down within seconds,” says Aravindan, a former construction labourer. Aravindan, who is now 65-years-old, had worked for close to three years on both towers of Alfa Serene at Maradu as an ironworker bending steel rods and tying rebars with a metal hooking tool.

“I worked there till the structural works were complete,” says Aravindan, who lives near Arakkal temple at Nettoor. For most of the local residents, the demolition is a painful event though they are aware of the illegalities that led to it. “Think of all the homeless people. They could have given the apartments to them,” said Dineshan, an electrician who stays near Alfa Serene. According to him many older buildings near the apartment complex had suffered cracks. “We all have been residing here peacefully for decades and now we are being punished for someone else’s sins,” says Prasad, who retired as a driver from government service.

The residents who stay near the apartment complexes, to be demolished by Vijay Steels on Saturday, have been asked to vacate at least three hours before the demolition.

“First they said 9am, now they want us to move out by 8am. But there are many families who are yet to get the promised three-month rent,” said Lalan, who retired from KSRTC. Didhi, who stays behind Alfa Serene, said she has kept their bags ready but did not move out since the promised three-month rent was not paid by the municipality . “Six families here have not been paid the promised rent,” said Didhi, who plans to move to Tripunithura.

Some are bitter about the insurance and the casual manner in which their concerns regarding security of their homes were treated. “The mosque facade was wrapped with polythene sheets by authorities only today after much pleading,” said Lalan, pointing to the glass facade of the Khadeejathul Kubra Islamic Complex, which also houses a madrassa.

Some hope that a public facility like a children’s park would come up in the spot once the building is demolished. “I think a park would be ideal because the kids here do not have such a facility,” said Lalan. But others are dismissive. “We hear the builder can construct another apartment complex in the same spot if he wants to. I don’t harbour such hope,” said Prasad.

KOCHI: A large consignment of the Holy Quran which was sent to Kerala for free distribution from Saudi Arabia is set to be auctioned out at Kochi after the importer, an Arabic college principal, expressed unwillingness to receive it as he was unable to pay the customs duty which amounted to Rs 8 lakh.

An advertisement of the auction notice issued by MIV Logistics in a Malayalam newspaper has been doing the rounds on social media. Abdul Salam I P, the importer, said that there is no controversy in the issue as a friend from Saudi had sent it to him for free distribution but he was not expecting such a high customs duty.

“It was imported after following correct documentation and through proper declarations. There is nothing unusual in it and hence there is no need for a controversy. There were some newspaper reports aimed at creating divisions. But there is nothing malicious in this,” said Abdul Salam.

He added that the Holy Quran is available for free in Saudi Arabia. “The holy book was aimed at the economically weaker believers. It was sent to Kochi in the backdrop of several faithful losing their Quran in the floods,” said Salam.

The ad for auctioning the books appeared in dailies in which January 20, 2020, 10am to 5pm was notified as the time for inspection and January 21 as date for e-auction. The auction notice was placed under the title ‘e-auction for disposal of unclaimed/uncleared imported goods by e-auction’. As per the notice, the consignment of the holy book weighed over 25,000kg. The base amount reportedly is Rs 1 lakh. Anyone quoting a higher amount will able to acquire the consignment.

The consignment landed at the Vallarpadom International Container Transhipment Terminal about six months ago. As the importer expressed his inability to pay the customs duty, they decided to auction it.

The auctioning will be held after getting the concerned customs clearance, sources said.

“I don’t know why it is becoming a controversy. We simply didn’t have the money to pay as customs duty. They informed me that the books would be auctioned out. And I understand that it has already been put up for auctioning on January 21,” said Abdul Salam.

Mumbai: In a battle between development and environment in Bhutan , greens mostly win. Bhutan’s former prime minister Dasho Tshering Tobgay told TOI his country’s environmental strategy was called the middle path. If a new project is expected to cause “excessive damage to the environment” it would not be allowed even at the expense of development, he said.

Tobgay said taking such decisions was never easy, therefore a country needs an enlightened leadership that does not just think of now and today. Leaders must be willing to step back and accept the challenges of climate change, he said during his lecture at IIT-Bombay ’s Techfest 2020, on how Bhutan had been able to maintain its carbon negative status. He said leadership must transcend kings, PMs and presidents but it means everyone at the individual level must be part of a large overall plan. He lauded India's efforts in renewable solar and wind energy as also getting LPG gas to the poor. “All these are big-ticket efforts and happening at the national level. At the state level, a clarion call must be made to local administration. All that aggregate effort will be good for the environment.”

While aware of the Aarey metro shed, he said it was inappropriate to comment on the issue as he was an “outsider”. — Hemali Chhapia

Trichy: The 80-year-old Trichy Corporation ’s elementary school in Puthur has got an airconditioned smart classroom equipped with audio-visual accessories. The aim of setting up the smart classroom is to increase the number of students enrolled in the school.

At present, there are only 35 students, including 24 girls studying between Classes I to V in the school situated on Bharathidasan Road. It has been catering to the basic education needs of underprivileged students in Vannarapettai locality. As the school’s strength has not seen any significant improvement in recent years, school headmistress P Amsavalli mooted a proposal to improve the infrastructure on a par with private schools. Subsequently, she used her own money to set up the smart classroom equipped with a projector, digital screen and audio systemsand an airconditioner at a cost of Rs 1 lakh . “We already had a computer. Through the QR scanner, the contents of textbooks were digitised. With the help of projector and audio systems, classes for the children from now on will be conducted completely in a digital way,” Amsavalli said.

The management said the smart classroom facility was established to prevent the parents from shifting their wards to private schools. Inaugurated last Saturday, the digital classroom evoked positive good response from the parents.

Besides the smart classroom, the school has also launched spoken English classes for the students. “Spoken English classes will be conducted by a college professor who volunteered to do it free of cost. We have also launched the distribution of healthy snacks like fruit salad and chickpeas during the morning hours,” Amsavalli added.

With two teachers including the HM, the management has planned to add one more smart classroom for augmenting the student strength.

446,['11/01/2020'],Greens fume at plan to fell 110 trees in Aurangabad,"This story is from January 11, 2020

AURANGABAD: Environment activists have expressed their displeasure after the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) issued a public notice in local newspapers on Friday morning asking for any objections to the felling of 110 trees for the Gopinath Munde memorial.

The activists objected to cutting of trees and said that the two-day time allotted for lodging objections to the trees felling is too short.

The municipal corporation, in a public notice on Friday, has given a list of 31 applications made by different individuals and organisations for cutting of trees. These applicants had sought permission from the civic body to cut trees in their property. Rotten trees, safety hazards and infrastructure development were the reasons provided for cutting of trees. The list also includes an application seeking public permission to cut 110 trees of different species for the establishment of Gopinath Munde’s memorial on the Government Milk Dairy land on Jalna Road.

The notice has sparked outrage among activists. According to activist Pankaj Shakkarwar, the public notice issued by the AMC under the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975 beats the core spirit of the law as the window to register objection is too short. “We expect that the memorial of such great personalities to be established by planting more trees and not by felling them,” Shakkarwar said.

Kishor Pathak, a nature lover and a homeopathic doctor, said that the Government Milk Dairy land which has been selected for Munde memorial has a thick green cover and a rich biodiversity . “For the nearby Jalna Road which sees heavy traffic all-round the day, the green cover acts as an oxygen hub,” Pathak said.

Also, the tree authority constituted by the municipal corporation, which gives the final nod for such applications, haven’t met for the last eight months, Pathak said.

AMC garden superintendent Vijay Patil said over the last eight months, the model code of conduct was implemented three times due to elections. “We have scheduled a meeting on Monday with the members of tree authority. No tree will be cut without the permission of the tree authority,” Patil said.

HYDERABAD: With discontent running high among people across municipalities, several candidates with no political track record have decided to contest the upcoming polls. Techies and businessmen are among those jumping into the poll fray hoping to make a difference on ground.

Software engineer Naveen Kumar Alashyam, who is contesting from Ward 8 in Manikonda , is among those who have filed nominations disgruntled with the lack of basic amenities in the area.

“I am planning to resign and take the voice of the people to the government,” said the 38-year-old, who says the struggle for water and good roads has been an uphill task till now.

“Growing up in the 80s, I saw my father stand tall even against Naxals. Like him, I too want to work for the people,” he said. Alashyam is among two candidates who are being put up by the Alkapur Township Residents’ Forum. Members of the Forum have been fighting for basic amenities for the township for long, but in vain.

The other candidate, Shrikant Swami, is a businessman contesting from Ward 9, Manikonda. “We are living in this high-profile IT corridor area in 2020, but it feels like we are back in the 1970s,” said Swami.

He says that safe drinking water is his primary poll plank. Speaking about why the resident welfare association has put up candidates this year, he said, “We had faith that local leaders and the government will do some good, but all in vain. So, we have decided to represent ourselves in the government bodies.”

In Tellapur, 45-year-old, Buddiga Satya Veni will contest from Ward 6. A software employee, her foray into electoral politics came after the protests over cutting of hundreds of trees on Tellapur-Nallagandla stretch last year.

“I was the first person to notice the chopping of trees, and among the first to sit there in protest.” Joining BJP, she said she wanted to ensure there is accountability over several issues, including roads, water and environment.

Twenty-five-year-old Saini Naveen Kumar will be a fresh face from Ward 16, Boduppal. Contesting as an Independent, this mechanical engineer has been working with a private firm. For him, education will be the focus. “Boduppal does not have a junior or degree college,” he said. If he wins, among the first priorities will be establishing a library in the area, he said.

On a similar plank, Ramana Reddy, from Ward 19 in Boduppal said he will push for better educational institutions. Asked why he decided to contest as an Independent, he said, “It’s about the connect I feel with people, and the need to take the municipality forward.”

Roads in trichy Cleaned ahead of vice president visit

TRICHY: Residents and commuters frequently passing through Karumandapam were in for a surprise three days ago to notice that either end of Dindigul Road had suddenly turned so clean without any litter. In fact corporation workers for the past few days have been leaving no stone unturned to make the locality look free of waste and temporary encroachments.

The reason? Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu ’s Trichy visit on Friday for the inauguration of the centenary year celebrations of National College Trichy (NCT) at Karumandapam. The appreciation from many soon turned into scorn on realising that such an effort, taken up on a war-footing, could only happen for VIP visits and never sustain. All through the route of the Vice President , at least 100 sanitary workers were involved in clearing the silt along the roads apart from the litter found on the vacant spaces adjacent to the roads in Mannarpuram, Trichy junction RoB and Karumandapam locality. The stretch usually witnesses heaps of accumulated waste. “Trichy corporation can do such impeccable cleaning every day without waiting for the VIPs to visit the city. Though the main roads of Karumandapam looked free of litter, the interior streets were not cleaned,” C Balasubramanian, a resident of Karumandapam said.

Apart from removing the waste accumulated on vacant space, corporation workers also removed the temporary encroachments on Dindigul Road. State highways department also refurbished the road that was sporting several potholes in a hurry. “The roads heading to Karumandapam look so wide now and the potholes near Trichy junction RoB were also corrected. It is sad that such work happens only when VIPs visit,” H Ghouse Baig, a resident of Khajamalai added.

Astik Kumar Pandey briefs Uddhav Thackeray (left) about the plan for Balasaheb Thackeray memorial

AURANGABAD: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said that he is exploring options on how more trees can be planted instead of cutting them at Priyadarshini Garden — the site selected for constructing Balasaheb Thackeray memorial .

He also told the designers to ensure that the memorial is environmentally rich and compliments the bio-diversity. Later, the two designers presented their plans for the project to district guardian minister Subhash Desai.

The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has selected a 17-acre green space in Priyadarshini Garden in Cidco N-6 area for building the memorial of Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray.

The project is titled Thackeray Smruti Van and the state government has allocated Rs 5 crore for the purpose. The establishment of the memorial, however, has been a cause of concern for environmentalists who fear that large number of trees will be axed to make way for the memorial. A PIL in this matter was also filed in the high court.

According to AMC, the garden has a total of 8,670 trees of which 850 have dried. Though mayor Nandkumar Ghodele, a Sena office-bearer, had earlier clarified that that the AMC will not cut any trees for the project, the environmentalists are still skeptical.

On Friday, Thackeray accompanied by Desai and Maharashtra chief secretary Ajoy Mehta visited the garden to take a review. At the site, the CM was briefed about two draft designs of the project produced by designers Manoj Dave from Noida and Dhiraj Deshmukh from Aurangabad in presence of municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey.

“The site should have trees that can become habitat for more birds,” Thackeray told the designers.

When Kishor Pathak, a nature lover, appealed to the CM to prevent cutting of trees for the memorial, Thackeray said he is exploring options how the number of trees can be increased at the site.

Speaking to TOI, Dave said that the designers have reworked their plan to ensure that project is environment-friendly.

Rajendra Joshi, a member of the activist group that is pushing for Garden’s conservation, said, “It seems to be a good plan and doesn’t require cutting of any trees rather includes additional plantation.”

Kamal Hasan

TRICHY: Inaugurating the third party headquarters near Trichy on Friday evening, Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) founder Kamal Haasan said that bringing the headquarters to the people and cadres was their first step towards the 2021 state assembly election. Earlier in the day, the actor-turned-politician discussed strategies with the newly elected party functionaries including state and district-level functionaries and urged them to strengthen the party at the grassroots by participating in grama sabhas.

Coming on the heels of launching headquarters in Chennai and Coimbatore, MNM representatives said the third headquarters was aimed at reaching the cadres and public in the central districts. Addressing the media after inaugurating the office at Ganesapuram near the Bhel township, Kamal Haasan said, “This (opening of headquarters) is the first step from us in preparing ourselves for 2021 ( Tamil Nadu assembly election). Instead of making the people visit us, the headquarters has now come to the people.” Party functionaries said that similar headquarters will be opened either in Madurai or Tirunelveli in the coming days. In a veiled criticism of the “cash for vote” system in the state, Kamal urged party cadres to be honest and promote honesty among the voters to change the state for good.

“To be honest is always possible. I request everyone to invest in Tamil Nadu, not only the monetary investment but also honesty as one of the forms of investments,” Kamal added. Claiming that there is no vacuum in the state, the MNM party founder said, “There is always a place in the heart of people but not vacuum. Deserving and qualified people are needed,” Kamal said. MNM sources said that the party cadres were told to participate effectively in grama sabha meetings and ensure better outcome from them to attract rural people to the party.

452,['11/01/2020'],"Two years on, govt sells only 4.7k of 1 lakh tonnes of Malaysian sand","This story is from January 11, 2020

Bengaluru: Malaysian sand, imported with much fanfare two years ago at a cost of over Rs 20 crore, has found very few takers. As a result, the government is stuck with 96% stock, which is lying at Krishnapattinam (Andhra Pradesh) port and is clueless on how to dispose of it.

The Congress government led by Siddaramaiah had decided to import sand beat alleged scarcity of the local variety. Till date, the government has sold only 4,750 tonnes of the one lakh tonnes it imported. Officials say the main reason for the lack of takers is concerns over quality and the price.

Mysore Sales International Limited (MSIL), the nodal government agency entrusted with procuring the sand, had initially planned to sell it in 50kg bags at a price of Rs 200 per bag. But buyers found it uneconomical as local sand from river beds was available at almost the same price in 2018, when the first consignment of sand from Malaysia arrived in the country.

“More than the pricing, people preferred the quality of sand mined from river beds. So they naturally preferred local sand over the imported product. MSIL also failed to convince customers on the quality of imported sand,” said an official of the mines and geology department.

Dealers also found the idea of selling sand in sacks unviable. Realising the problem, the government slashed the price of imported sand by 25% and allowed dealers to sell in bulk. But by then, the damage had been done. “The commodity had lost its appeal,” said a Malaysian sand dealer.

However, Mahaveer, a MSIL consultant in-charge of procurement and sale of Malaysian sand, insisted demand for the imported variety was robust. “We have got an order for 10,000 tonnes and the sale will go through in a week,” Mahaveer said.

He attributed the low sale to legal hurdles in transporting sand to Karnataka from Krishnapattinam port.

“When the sand arrived at the port, inter-state movement of mines was not allowed as per the Mines and Minerals Act. We could not transport the sand, although there was demand. The state government amended this rule only in November 2019. We can now focus on marketing the remaining sand aggressively,” he said.

He also said concerns about quality are unfounded. “The imported sand is IS383 certified. It has passed seven quality parameters,” he said.

TRICHY: Two daily wage labourers died under unexplained circumstances while one person was hospitalised after consuming liquor near Thuraiyur town on Friday. Police suspect that the victims could have added something to the liquor for increasing the intoxication, thus causing the fatality.

Police sources said the three labourers identified as Damodaran, 55, P Saravanan, 30 and R Sathish, 30, all working in Kannanur village, consumed liquor in their possession on Friday morning around 6.30 am. After their binge session near a hairdressing outlet, the trio headed to their respective houses in the hamlet. However, Saravanan swooned and died on reaching home while Damodaran fell sick and was first rushed to Kannanur PHC from where he was referred to Thuraiyur GH. He died before getting any medical attention. Meanwhile, Sathish was rushed to Perambalur GH after he complained of uneasiness and is undergoing intensive care. Jambunathapuram police personnel rushed to the spot and carried out inquiries.

“The liquor bottle seems to be that of Tasmac but the batch number found in the bottle is not in sales and circulation now. The deceased Damodaran had brought the liquor bottle, so the origin of the liquor is known only to him. The victims may have added ingredients to enhance the intoxicating effect,” a senior police official investigating the crime said.

Police sources added that the smell of floor cleaner emanated from the liquor bottle consumed by the trio. Jambunathapuram police collected the remains in the bottle and viscera of the victims and sent the samples to the police forensic laboratory in Trichy city for detailed investigation. The condition of Sathish was said to be serious and further inquiry is under way.

CHENNAI: The corporation will organise an exchange mela of sorts in Adyar zone on Sunday and Monday through which residents can exchange recyclable and reusable items from their households.

Those who do not wish to exchange can even donate used items.

This ‘ swap shop ’ will be set up at the Tamil Nadu Housing Board community hall near Besant Nagar bus terminus. The project has been initiated by Alby John, deputy commissioner, South Region, Greater Chennai Corporation .

The items will be sold at a nominal price at the ‘reuse and reduce’ sale and residents can swap similar items. From toys to electrical appliances such as toasters to small furniture, bags, trolleys and used bicycles, citizens can exchange items they want to.

The civic body has urged the public to not use the opportunity to dispose old items and share things in working condition which would be of use to others. “The idea is to reduce shopping and start swapping. What we may not need anymore can be of real use to someone else,” said a senior corporation official.

According to an official statement, the civic body may also purchase items from those who bring recyclable objects in bulk.

However, corporation officials have urged residents to look at it not as an opportunity to get rid of household waste and bring only those objects that are reusable.

Residents, who may not be able to visit the ‘swap shop’, can drop off the items at collection points set up in wards across Adyar (Zone 13), the corporation said. According to a corporation official, it’s also an opportunity to cut the amount of waste being sent to Kodungaiyur and Perungudi dumpyards.

The city generates about 5,200 tonnes of solid waste a day and the civic body has adopted various measures — from segregation to resource recycling and composting units — to reduce the waste sent to landfills, an official said.

“Instead of waiting for the items to get to the point where they are unusable and eventually dumped, this is a better option,” the official added.

Representative image

TRICHY: The university grants commission (UGC) has asked an assistant professor of a government aided arts and science college to refund the money sanctioned to him for a minor research project in 2017. While the fund was sanctioned to the college account, the faculty member never received it and the college too failed to inform him about it. The college claimed it was unaware of having received the fund as it was transferred to its common account.

The UGC had sanctioned Rs 1 lakh to P Soundararajan, assistant professor of economics department, Urumu Dhanalakshmi College, for his minor project to study the impact of information and communication technology on rural development in Trichy district. He was informed about the fund being sanctioned but didn’t receive any communication from the UGC it was transferred. Last month-end, after almost two years, he received a mail from UGC directing him to refund Rs 65,000 with 10% interest per annum. The UGC claimed that the fund was released by it in 2017 for the project but he had not submitted any report on his research.

E R Ravichandran, principal of Urumu Dhanalakshmi College, told TOI that they never received any communication from UGC on release of the fund to the bank account of the college. “While Soundararajan too didn’t receive any communication, we were unaware that we had received funds from UGC. Since we receive funds to a common bank account of the college where other faculty members too receive funds, we didn’t realise that we had received funds meant for Soundararajan,” he said.

He further said that the developments happened in 2017 and it has been only six months since he took charge as principal of the college. However, Association of University Teachers (AUT) put the onus of the incident on the college management and sought a special audit from the UGC of the funds allotted by it to the college.

Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu has asked students to practise any ideology only after they are out of their institution as a tense mind cannot pay attention to academic activity. He said protest is part of democracy . “But we should not allow destruction of public property. We should not allow violence to take place in any public activity as peace is prerequisite for progress.” .

Naidu was in Trichy on Friday to inaugurate the centenary celebrations of National College Trichy (NCT). “Nothing wrong in supporting an ideology but practising an ideology should be only when you are out of the institutions,” he said adding that such activities will spoil the future of students and reputation of the institution. Starting his speech in Tamil by greeting members of the NCT college management, he stressed on preserving the mother tongue. He said there was nothing wrong in learning Hindi, but it should not be imposed. In this respect, Naidu said it was only by knowing the language spoken by the majority in the country that he could rise to the second constitutional authority of the country. He stressed that all state government communication should be in the local language.

461,['11/01/2020'],Residents threaten ‘jail bharo’ protest,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Aurangabad: Locals from different communities have threatened to carry out a mass ‘jail bharo’ agitation against the Parbhani police for booking over 10,000 people in at least two of the six cases registered on December 20 for protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

While five of the offences have been registered for violence, the sixth case has been lodged for forcing shops in the market to remain shut. The registered FIRs include names of even those who had been out of the country for performing of Umrah—a mini pilgrimage. There are some names which have allegedly been repeated in the FIRs. The protest in Parbhani took a violent turn after some miscreants resorted to stone pelting.

People from different walks of life have formed Samvidhan Bachao Samiti (SBS), an umbrella organisation to put up a united front against the implementation of the CAA, NRC and NPR.

SBS president Vijay Wakode told TOI, “It is shocking that around 12, 000 people have been booked in at least two of the five FIRs. We want these FIRs to be withdrawn as innumerable innocents have been booked.”

The members of the outfit made a presentation to Parbhani district collector on Friday. Later, the members took out a mega rally in the town against the police’s alleged excesses as well as against CAA, NRC and NPR.

SBS vice president Rajan Kshirsagar said, “Parbhani police are trying to replicate the Gorakhpur pattern here. We will not let that happen. The incident of stone pelting has been used as an opportunity by the police for committing vendetta against the citizens.”

Nitin Sawant, another core committe member, said that the Parbhani police were prejudiced against Muslims and that was the sole reason why even the innocents, who tried stopping the miscreants from stone pelting, were named in the FIRs.

Regional head of Jamiat Ulema E Hind, Mufti Mirza Kaleem, said that Maulana Rafiuddin Ashrafi, who went for Umrah on December 11 from Mumbai to Saudi Arabia returned only on December 26. Ashrafi, who is Parbhani district’s leading cleric who leads the Eid prayers, found his name in the FIR despite being on a pilgrimage.

Veterinary Anwar Ali Shah had gone to Pune on December 19 and returned just a couple of days ago. Hafeez Nazir, who too had been for Umrah and returned days after the incident, also found his name in the FIRs.

Despite repeated attempts, Parbhani superintendent of police Krishnakant Upadhyay could not be reached for his comments. Special inspector general of police, Nanded range, Manoj Lohiya told TOI, “The investigation officer (IO) is going through the video clips. Only those identified are facing action. There is no question of any innocent being implicated.”

KOCHI: At 12.45pm, a siren was heard and vehicles on byroads leading to the flats at Maradu were blocked. Later, the siren was sounded four more times from Maradu municipality around 2pm and vehicle movement resumed once again. This was done as part of the mock drill to ascertain the preparedness of various agencies involved in the demolition of the four illegal buildings on Saturday and Sunday.

The drill, headed by commissioner Vijay Sakhare, was conducted so that the police, fire force and medical personnel understood their duties and identified spots they need to guard at the exclusion zone of each building. Fire tenders and ambulances were parked at the boundary of the exclusion zone.

The drill at 10am was delayed as the technical committee and demolition expert from Indore SB Sarwate inspected each site to review preparedness. Also, during the drill, traffic on NH-66 was blocked for 10 minutes and it led to congestion. Seeing the police contingent, pedestrians and students came near Holy Faith H2O to click photos.

After completing the drill at the municipality building, the technical committee moved to Jains Coral Cove for the same procedure. Though the siren was sounded five times, it did not invoke much curiosity as everyone knew what was going on. Police, fire, revenue officials and technical committee members will monitor the implosion of Holy Faith H2O and Alfa Serene sitting at the control room on different screens.

The drill at Golden Kayaloram will be done on Saturday after the demolition of Holy Faith H2O and Alfa Serene.

CM Pinarayi Vijayan

KOCHI: New projects worth nearly Rs 1 lakh crore were registered at Ascend Kerala 2020, the global investors meet organized by the departments of industries and commerce, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan . On Friday, the state government signed MoUs with some the investors or received letters of intent from others.

“We had 136 projects are ready for investment today and further two were added just now – between all these projects, there will be total investments of Rs 32,008 crore. On top this, the Kerala Infrastructure Fund Management Ltd signed an MoU on Friday, but is only one among their six projects with a total worth of Rs 8,110 crore,” Vijayan said.

“Apart from these, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has shown interest in investing Rs 66,900 crore in developing logistics parks across the state. So, of this, there are altogether fresh promises to invest Rs 98,708 crore,” Vijayan said. With a number of investors unable to make it to the event, the chief minister has deputed principal secretary (industries) K Ellangovan to meet such potential investors in the coming days.

Regarding the ease of doing business, our state had lagged behind, compared to others and our current endeavour is to make Kerala one of the top five states in terms of ease of conducting business, Vijayan said. “We have already made significant improvements in this regard and that was the result of co-ordinated efforts of various governmental agencies. Through discussions with investors we identified the bottlenecks and brought out legislations like Kerala Micro Small Medium Enterprises Facilitation Act,” he added.

In Kerala, you will not need any middlemen to start business, Vijayan said. “You can approach any official, right from village officer to the CM’s office, where a friendly attitude will be ensured. We know that there are some officials who take a negative stand and to sort that out, we will organize a meeting of heads of departments and representatives of investors,” he said.

The government will also focus on skill development. “If you need to be employed in these new projects, you might need new skillsets and training. For this, we will revise the curriculum after discussions with the universities and respective industry,” Vijayan said.

Saligao: Two developmental works — the improvement of a dilapidated underground culvert and the widening of a road at Mae De Deus ward in Sangolda will soon commence.

Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar on Friday inaugurated the projects, estimated to cost Rs 13 lakh.

The road to be widened currently connects the ward from the main Chogm road and takes commuters towards Guirim.

With a temple being located on the same stretch along with a church, the road often witnesses traffic congestion. The works are being taken up by the authorities as a solution to this issue.

“While inspecting the road, we noticed that the culvert was on the verge of being damaged. So we prepared an estimate and decided to take up the works,” the Saligao MLA said.

The culvert will be made three metres wide and 10 metres long. The road will be widened by three metres.

Senior citizens in the area had been demanding the road widening work to be taken up on priority to ease the traffic congestion.

CHANDIGARH: The National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) has directed the UT administration to submit a detailed report on the functioning of the Jaypee garbage processing plant at Dadumajra.

UT adviser Manoj Parida, municipal corporation commissioner K K Yadav and UT chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai appeared before the NGT on Friday in connection with cases related to water pollution, solid waste management and air pollution.

The officials submitted a detailed presentation of construction and demolition waste plant, legacy waste bio mining plant, bio medical waste plant and functioning of sewage treatment plants in the city. The NGT members were ‘impressed’ with the steps taken by the administration in other areas but not satisfied with the functioning of the garbage processing plant.

Recently, the NGT had directed Justice Pritam Pal (retd) committee to review the solid waste management situation in Chandigarh. The NGT has even sought a report from the panel on or before January 31, 2020.

Earlier, the committee had been looking into the pollution at river Ghaggar.

The civic body and the Jaypee plant are at loggerheads over the processing of garbage at the Dadumajra site.

The latest tribunal order stated, “We are informed that the committee constituted by the tribunal in original application to oversee the compliance of Solid Waste Management Rules-2016, headed by Justice Pritam Pal is still in operation. The committee must furnish a report.”

Recently, another committee formed by the NGT had submitted in its report that 25,000 metric tonne unprocessed mixed waste has been lying at the garbage processing plant. The report was placed before the NGT during its resumed hearing in connection with the solid waste management system in the city. On this, the NGT had asked the civic body to complete the task by March 31, 2020.

The committee formed by the NGT comprised Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) member secretary, representative of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change , and a professor from Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh.

The CPCC had even sought a clarification from the MC as the NGT was keeping a close eye on the matter. In a letter, the CPCC had written that during their panel’s visit to the plant on October 23, 2019, between 2pm and 3pm, the Jaypee management had submitted that the plant was accepting 150 metric tonne of waste a day, whereas the MC staff said the average waste that went there was 242.27 metric tonne a day. But till date, the MC failed to submit a reply. The CPCC had asked the MC commissioner to give clarification on the data mismatch.

Recently, the pollution panel had slapped a penalty of Rs 1.46 crore on Jaypee for violating environment rules while processing garbage at the dumping ground. The penalty was calculated at Rs 75,000 daily from February 20 to September 2. The notice was issued under Section 33-A of the Water (Prevention of the Pollution) Act, 1974, Section 31-A of the Air (Prevention of the Pollution) Act of 1981 and Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act of 1986.

The processing plant authorities had challenged the penalty before the tribunal.

The CPCC had earlier, too, issued a show-cause notice to Jaypee after finding various violations.

Two men died in police firing . Kumaraswamy demanded the setting up of a joint House committee to investigate the incident.

“The main culprit is Mangaluru city police commissioner PS Harsha. He was the one who instigated the mob. A joint legislative committee comprising members from all parties alone can bring out the truth behind police excess. I will take up this issue on the floor of the House in the upcoming session,"" Kumaraswamy told reporters on Friday.

He said police instigated the violence by pelting stones at protesters. When protesters retaliated, police opened fire. He said that magisterial inquiry ordered by the government cannot be trusted.

In all, Kumaraswamy released 35 video clips . He alleged the police attack was unprovoked and was unleashed on students, bystanders and street vendors. “Even before the police commissioner ordered his men to fire, cops were ready to fire. This is not just a case of failure of law and order, but willful involvement of police forces in violence,” he said. “I wanted to present the videos to Justice Gopala Gowda, who is conducting a public hearing, but police did not allow me to do so.”

Sunil Kumar Singh

PANAJI: A team of the crime branch of the Goa police left for Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh on Friday to find out the antecedents of the accused who was arrested for impersonating as a cooperative minister of the UP government. The court has also extended his police custody by four more days.

Speaking to TOI, crime branch SP Pankaj Kumar Singh said that as per investigation, it has come to light that the accused had impersonated only to avail of free stay in Goa.

Sunil Kumar Singh, 48, a resident of Lucknow, was arrested early this week. Until his arrest, Singh was a state guest, who was accorded all facilities. He stayed at plush government guest houses, toured the state in a government provided vehicle, had a police security officer (PSO) to accompany him wherever he went, and also attended an event in South Goa as the ‘chief guest’. It was only when he inquired about a masseuse and massage services over a drink that his cover was finally blown.

It all started with an email that the protocol department received, requesting to book the state-run Circuit House for Singh’s stay. Without verifying the email, the department considered him as a state guest and reserved a room for three days in the city.

473,['11/01/2020'],Wigneswaran: Grant dual citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamils,"This story is from January 11, 2020

Vellore: Justice C V Wigneswaran , former chief minister of Sri Lanka ’s Northern Province and the chief guest at a Pongal event organised by Vellore Tamil Sangam at Voorhees College , on Friday urged the Indian government to grant dual citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamils earning their livelihood on Indian soil for more than three decades.

Addressing the media, Wigneswaran said, “Our key demand is that Sri Lankan Tamils return to our motherland. However, considering the benefits they receive in India (Tamil Nadu), including education for their children, which they could not disassociate from all of a sudden, we request the Indian government to grant dual citizenship to the Lankan Tamils living as refugees after addressing all legal issues so that their children’s education is not affected.”

Elected president with overwhelming support from Sinhalas and Buddhists, the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government’s every move focuses only on the welfare and prosperity of these two majority communities which gave him an easy win, he said. Tamil people who are in minority have been sidelined and are leading a fear-filled life since the crowning of Gotabaya, he said.

“Since the civil war broke out in Sri Lanka in 1983, so far more than 10 lakh Lankan Tamils have migrated to various countries fearing for their lives and are living as refugees. Only in a few countries have they been granted citizenship. If dual citizenship is awarded to the entire 10 lakh Sri Lankan Tamil migrants and their descendants, it will create a prosperous platform in our motherland,” he added.

Asked whether Tamils are subjected to any cruelty by the Sri Lankan government, Wigneswaran said, “Learning from experience, the Gotabaya government won’t initiate any steps that disturb the peace of Tamils and hope it won’t incite any hatred against them. We hope that the Gotabaya government’s present stand of not cooperating with the UN probe on war crimes will also be reconsidered at the earliest.”

Indore: To ensure adequate supply of water for drinking and irrigation, Narmada-Gambhir Link project was inaugurated in Kankaria village of Sanwer tehsil by NVDA minister Surendra Singh Baghel and health minister Tulsiram Silawat on Friday.

Amidst slogans of ‘Jai Narmada Maiyya’, the ministers inaugurated the project that will meet water demand for drinking and agriculture in 43 villages of Sanwer area.

“I had a dream to bring Narmada water in Sanwer to solve water shortage. I had given a slogan ‘Narmada Maiyya Sanwer Chalo’ in 1985. It finally got fulfilled,” said Silawat adding that farmers will now get uninterrupted water supply for irrigation.

He added that three clusters of total 43 villages will be prepared to supply tap water for drinking in every household.

While addressing the gathering, Baghel congratulated locals on inauguration of the project. “On Silawat’s initiative, state government prepared an intensive irrigation scheme for Sanwer, which will be implemented with a cost of Rs 2400 crore and will benefit 182 villages of the area and help in irrigation in 80,000 hectare,” the NVDA minister said.

He added that 2.5 MLD water will also be supplied for drinking in Sanwer.

On the occasion, Depalpur MLA Vishal Patel also raised demand of developing Yashwant Sagar as a tourist destination while former minister Rameshwar Patel demanded developing a ‘Kund’ at Narmada-Gambhir Link Project in Kankariya village.

Baghel assured both leaders to do the needful.

Indore: A four-year-old girl died on Friday from grievous burn injuries sustained, when she poured hot water on her body from a tub kept by her mother to give her a bath.

Banganga police station in charge Indramani Patel said that the incident took place in Karol Bagh on Wednesday.

Minor daughter of watchman Rampal Golkar identified as Ritika was playing in the front room, when her mother Pinki called her to take a bath. She poured the hot water into the tub and summoned her. While Pinki went to the other room to keep the water container, the minor rushed to the bathroom and poured the water on her shoulder using a tumbler. Hearing her screams, Pinki rushed inside and tried to pour cold water on her burns. She alerted her neighbours and asked for their help. They rushed the minor to the hospital where she was admitted for treatment. The left portion of her body was burnt because of the hot boiling water, said doctors. They treated her for two days but her condition started deteriorating and she succumbed to the injuries on Friday morning. Banganga police said that the case has been registered and body of the minor was handed over to family members after post mortem examination and further investigations have been initiated. TNN

D Dayakar Reddy

HYDERABAD: It had all the trappings of realpolitik. On Friday morning, a peeved TRS leader bade goodbye to the party and jumped into Congress. D Dayakar Reddy , however, quit the grand old party and came back rushing to the ruling party. This high drama began and got over in two hours.

While Congress leaders claimed that Dayakar was bulldozed by minister Ch Malla Reddy, TRS leaders asserted Dayakar had rejoined the party on his own volition after realising his folly.

What forced Dayakar to go out and again come back into TRS? Associates close to him said he was hurt that the TRS leadership did not announce his candidature for the mayor post from Peerzadiguda Municipal Corporation. Dayakar had worked as a upa sarpanch of Peerzadiguda as a TDP leader and joined TRS five years ago. He also served as TRS secretary of Rangareddy district.

He is considered as a close associate of former Medchal MLA M Sudheer Reddy. Sudheer and Malla Reddy, who presently represents Medchal in the state assembly, are believed to not get along well and it is alleged that Dayakar was denied the mayoral candidature because of his closeness with Sudheer.

Sources said Dayakar has been nursing the mayoral ambitions from the newly formed Peerzadiguda corporation. Malla Reddy is in-charge of the party Medchal unit and Dayakar’s chances suffered a setback after it became clear the party was considering another candidate.

In the meanwhile, Congress saw a chance and roped in Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy, who went to Dayakar’s house and invited him to join Congress. Dayakar was not only assured of the mayor candidature but was also handed over form ‘B’ as a Congress nominee for the ward member (since it is an indirect election).

Dayakar then joined Congress in presence of Revanth and Medchal Congress unit chief Srisailam Goud at around 12 noon. About half a dozen of his supporters also joined Congress. Revanth even addressed a media conference with Dayakar in tow. Once Malla Reddy got wind of this, he made a dash to the house of Dayakar at Peerzadiguda along with Malkajgiri TRS incharge Marri Rajasekhar Reddy. He held closed-door discussions with Dayakar and mollified him.

When Revanth, who was on his way back home, came to know about Malla Reddy camping at Dayakar’s house, he rushed to the latter’s house. Alerted by this development, Malla Reddy took Dayakar in his car to an undisclosed location. Since last reports came in, Dayakar continued to be incommunicado to TRS and Congress leaders.

KOCHI: Experts at the global investors meet, Ascend 2020 Kerala , on Friday stressed the need for the country to embrace Industry 4.0 and digital technologies at the earliest so as to lap up investment opportunities and compete with other emerging nations.

While speaking at a plenary session on ‘Industry 4.0 – Trends and Impact for Future’, on the final day of the two-day meet, Sushant Rabra, partner-digital, KPMG India, said that globally, Industry 4.0 and digital technologies are being adopted across sectors like manufacturing, transportation, energy and telecom.

Rabra added that for the adoption of Industry 4.0 in India, the government can act as a facilitator while the industry bodies can function as enablers by bringing together all stake holders.

In his address, Dr Suresh Nair, CTO, NeST Group, said there was no option but to adopt Industry 4.0 since it’s beneficial in all aspects like quality, cost, delivery and safety.

Commenting on Kerala’s perspective on the subject, Nair said: “It will give more opportunities for startups, and hardware and software borders will merge. Kerala’s strengths are engineering talent and resources.”

478,['11/01/2020'],Satara Road's BRTS lane swings between now on and now off,"The BRTS is a good concept and will work if planned and executed in a flawless manner: Secretary of PMP Pravas... Read More

TimesView The BRTS route on Satara Road is in a mess. Its revival has failed due to the utter lack of coordination between civic departments and transport authorities. While flyovers between Swargate and Padmavati have damaged the original corridor’s alignment, the authorities have now began installing ten new bus stops promising that these will not obstruct the Metro work which is being contemplated in the same corridor. It is high time that all the agencies submit a joint plan to ensure that their projects do not overlap and the taxpayer’s money is not wasted.

PUNE: Months after the Pune traffic police announced opening up of all four Bus Rapid Transit System routes in Pune for movement of all traffic, fresh barricades have come up on some sections of the Pune-Satara Road and construction of new bus stops along the Katraj-Swargate BRTS corridor has started.Owner of a welding workshop outside Parvati Industrial Estate said, “The work between Market Yard junction and Panchami Hotel junction started 15 to 20 days ago. The earlier barricades were removed and new ones have been installed. The movement of traffic towards Katraj has increased manifold as the road has once again narrowed down after one side of the opened BRTS corridor was blocked.”Two construction workers on the stretch said, “We have installed new railings on the Swargate to Katraj side right now. Work is going on along the entire 5 km stretch. New bus stops are also being made. Some are ready, like the one outside Hotel Panchami. The ones under construction will have the same design. After this, the barricade on the other side of the corridor will be finalized.”Local resident Purva Sankhla said over the last decade, they have seen the BRTS fail as a project. Some new bus stops were created a few months ago but the work was stalled. The corridor was opened for movement of all vehicles and barricades were removed. Now, parts of the corridor have been blocked and work has commenced, she added.“There is no clarity on what is going on. What if the plan for the extension of the Metro is cleared and the newly constructed corridor has to be blocked again or brought down to accommodate construction of the Metro? Is there a greater inclusive plan for an integrated transport system? This looks like nothing but a waste of money,” she said.Secretary of PMP Pravasi Manch, Sanjay Shitole, said, “The BRTS is a good concept and will work if planned and executed in a flawless manner. As of now, there are no safety measures along the corridors. The authorities are repeating the same mistakes while redoing the corridor. The new bus stops, for example, have no visibility to see the oncoming bus, just the like old ones. The new work is adding cosmetic appeal and is a waste of money.”Shitole also questioned the need for a metro along the same route as the BRTS. “Instead of wasting crores on an underground metro, alternatives like smaller standing buses along the Katraj-Swargate stretch would be cheaper and more efficient,” he explained.Programme director of Parisar, Ranjit Gadgil said that the civic body needs an integrated BRTS and Metro plan. “There has been ad-hoc completion and stoppage of BRTS work. There is no clarity on when and how the BRTS corridor mentioned in the Development Plan (DP) will be made. We have raised this issue with the old and present municipal commissioner but have not heard from them. A meeting between the Metro officials and PMC road department needs to be held to work out a plan for an integrated transit system rather than each body functioning individually. Overlaps of metro and BRTS will not be beneficial for anybody,” Gadgil explained.BRTS manager, Anant Waghmare said the work on the Satara Road corridor has been going on for a while now.“We are making 10 bus stops along the stretch and the corridor will resemble the Alandi Road one. We have also considered the probable metro work along this stretch. Ahmednagar Road and parts of Pimpri-Chinchwad have the metro running through the BRTS corridor but there have been no hindrances. The Satara Road corridor will also work in a similar fashion,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73198004,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-454927,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/satara-rd-brts-lane-swings-between-now-on-now-off/articleshow/73195966.cms

Indore: MY Hospital administration constituted a second medical board to prepare a report on health condition of a high-profile-attempt to murder accused admitted in a private ward of the hospital despite a previous board recommending against his admission and suggesting treatment in out-patient department (OPD).

Kapil Jaiswal, accused of opening fire at a businessman, Shailendra Verma, at an office in Indore Trade Centre on January 3, was admitted to MY Hospital the next day with complaints of blunt trauma and bleeding hemorrhoids. The accused was put under care of Dr Sonia Moses in private ward number 310 of surgical unit.

The court of JFMC Mayank Shukla on February 5 sought opinion on Jaiswal’s health conditions from Choti Gwaltoli police. Police asked MY superintendent about the medical opinion in accordance to court order.

Hospital sources said a medical board comprising professor (surgery) Dr Manish Kaushal, assistant professor (medicine) Dr Manoj Gupta and assistant professor (surgery) Dr Abhay Brahmate was constituted on January 7 on order of medical officer Aparna Sharma with permission of MY superintendent Dr AD Bhatnagar.

Assistant professor (orthopaedic) Dr Namit Pawar was included in the board a day later.

Medical board headed by Dr Kaushal on January 8 found that admission was not required and recommended that Jaiswal may be treated in OPD of neurology and orthopaedic. This recommendation was signed by all doctors on the panel.

But, a footnote was written individually by Dr Namit Pawar in the report referring the case to senior neuro physician, neurosurgeon and senior orthopaedic doctor.

Subsequently, Dr Moses discharged the patient from her care and sent a note to on-duty doctor asking that police may be informed about the move. But before the information was conveyed, Jaiswal was taken under care of hospital deputy director Dr DK Sharma.

“I received a call for transfer of the patient with injury on the back,” Dr Sharma told TOI, confirming formation of the first medical board.

He said the board could not arrive at a clear conclusion and advocated for opinion from senior neurosurgeon, neuro physician and orthopaedician.

Subsequently, a fresh medical board comprising neuro surgeon Dr Rakesh Gupta, surgeon Dr Arvind Shukla, orthopaedic Dr Laxman Banoda and neurologist Dr Archana Sharma was formed. It examined Jaiswal and is learnt to have come to a conclusion that he may be given conservative treatment for his spinal issue.

PUNE: Seasonal changes triggered by the night temperatures dropping faster than the day’s mercury levels, coupled with the moisture in the atmosphere, are triggering ailments such as cold, cough, flu and diarrhoea among children and adults.Expressing concerns over the rise in viral infection and allergic bronchitis cases, doctors have urged people to protect themselves guarded against cold, stay away from those suffering from cold and fever, wash hands at regular intervals and keep the body warm, as viruses attack most when the body temperature is down.“Of the total children I see every day, about 60% are down viral fever. About 3-4% of them have bacterial pneumonia — an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs,” paediatrician Sanjay Mankar said. “The most affected are the children less than five years of age. Children typically get affected with bacterial pneumonia after an episode of viral fever,” said Mankar, who is also president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP), Pune.Paediatrician Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director of Bharati Hospital, said, “Winter ailments such as common cold, sore throat, sinusitis, lower respiratory infections including bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, bronchiolitis and asthma are on the rise. Since January 1, we have been seeing around 50-60 children daily at our paediatric outpatient department.”“As the body has to adjust to the low and fluctuating temperatures, a weakened immune system becomes an easy target for bacteria and viruses. Winter is the blooming season for various flowers. Allergic disorders like asthma caused by the pollen aggravate during the season. Besides, smog and cold air precipitate asthma attack,” Oswal said.Young children and people above 60 years are more vulnerable to these ailments. “Children are getting affected with fever, cough, runny or blocked stuffy nose, sneezing, headache, pain in throat, body ache, breathing difficulty and noisy respiration. Often, other family members are affected simultaneously,” he said.“People with bronchial asthma, diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease are more vulnerable to contracting influenza. Also, children and adults who are on immuno-suppressive therapy for diseases such as cancer, arthritis and other autoimmune diseases are also at high risk of contacting these infections,” Oswal said.Paediatrician Amruta Walimbe said, “If treatment is delayed or not taken, the cure for diseases such as common cold, sore throat and sinusitis can take longer time, usually over a week. In case of lower respiratory tract infections and asthma, delayed treatment can lead to respiratory failure.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73198323,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-313644,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fluctuating-temperatures-trigger-ailments-children-worst-affected/articleshow/73195973.cms

Generally, parties and candidates have to submit their Form A and B along with the nominations.Parties used this opportunity to hold back giving Form B, mainly to thwart rebel candidates from switching over to other parties.The parties are hopeful of convincing rebel candidates before withdrawal of nominations on January 14.

HYDERABAD: It’s advantage for TRS even before elections are held to 120 municipalities and 10 municipal corporations on January 22. TRS has over 120 crucial votes on its side for election of mayors and municipal chairpersons. As per the Municipal Act, MPs, MLAs and MLCs are ex-officio members having voting rights for election of mayors and chairpersons in municipal corporations and municipalities they opt for.

TRS has 104 MLAs and 13 MPs from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and 30 MLCs as ex-officio members on its side. Congress has six MLAs, three MPs and an MLC and BJP has three MPs, an MLA and MLC.

“Even if 15 to 30 from core city of Greater Hyderabad who opt for GHMC are exempted from the list, the ruling TRS still will have about 130 ex-officio votes. In the case of a tight contest for election of mayors or chairpersons, the ex-officio votes will be crucial,” a senior TRS leader said.

As per the Municipal Act, it is going to be an indirect election for mayors and municipal chairpersons. Corporators will elect one among them as a mayor, while councillors will elect one among them as a chairperson in municipalities. Unless Congress and BJP have a clear majority, it will be difficult for the two main opposition parties to win the seat of mayors.

PUDUCHERRY: A 15-year-old girl died of dengue on Friday in Puducherry . The girl identified as S Ramya, a Class IX student of a government girls’ higher secondary school was undergoing treatment at the Indira Gandhi government general hospital and postgraduate institute since she was admitted on January 5.

Health officials said the girl was suffering from high fever and was admitted with symptoms of dengue. She did not respond to the treatment and died on Friday.

A team of experts deputed by the Union government in 2017 to investigate the outbreak of dengue in Puducherry cited several inadequacies in the preparedness in the prevention of dengue by the Puducherry government. The team warned that the issue will go out of control if proper precautionary measures were not taken up immediately. The team identified red alert areas in the town limits that have become breeding ground for dengue disease-spreading mosquitoes.

The government launched a series of initiatives and brought down the incidence of dengue by 5% in 2018 when compared to 2017. The government hospitals, community health centres and primary health centres started administering nilavemu decoction to the people reducing the incidence of dengue in the territory. TNN

Venkiah Naidu

NAGPUR: In an oblique reference to the ongoing protests against CAA, NRC and NPR and attack on JNU students, vice-president Venkaiah Naidu on Friday said here that obstruction and destruction must be stopped while people must “burn the problematic idea” reminding that “after all this is your country”.

Amid the prevailing opposition to CAA, NRC and NPR, peaceful protests have been carried out across the country with alleged violence being reported from BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka.

Delhi, where law and order comes under Union home ministry, too saw violence at Jamia University and JNU in the wake of opposition to right wing ideas.

“Burning bus or train will not help anyone. You will have to burn the idea and not physical things. Violence can never succeed. Entire world has come to know this. If you have tension you can’t pay attention. Peace must prevail in the country,” said Naidu.

At the same time, he said institutions of learning must teach students about freedom fighters Chandrashekhar Azad and Bhagat Singh.

Naidu emphasized on peaceful coexistence. “India is one nation having so many languages and traditions. Peace is very much required for progress. We must all come together to see that we create a peaceful existence, peaceful country and peaceful world,” he said.

The vice-president also said that prosperity alone is not enough while our traditional knowledge must be passed on to all generation for maintaining peace in the country. “Indian civilization is one of the oldest. India has a great future as our ‘parampara’ has quality of adaptability,” said Naidu.

He was speaking at the inauguration of the three-day 50th session of the All India Oriental Conference organized by Kavikulaguru Kalida Sanskrit University (KKSU) at the Suresh Bhat Auditorium.

Being a proponent of native languages, Naidu started his speech in Marathi and then went on to acknowledge Sanskrit connection with several North Indian as well as international languages.

On educating GenNext about Indian heroes, saints and personalities, Naidu said he was compulsorily taught History subject.

“Now not much importance is given to history, PT and craft. Teach kids who was Azad, Bhagat Singh, Sant Tukaram, Jhansi Rani, Alur Sitaraman,” he said.

Appealing for an overhaul in education system, Naidu said the Kasturirangan committee has given good recommendations which must be adopted. “During our school days, we were taught to respect nature. Nature plus culture means better future. Culture is way of life. Whatever you call it, Hindu Sanskriti or any other term, be proud of it,” he said.

Naidu called for revisiting the Indian ancient system of learning and teaching to overcome colonization. “It is high time we revisited our system. I appeal to all principals and academicians to teach our kids only in mother tongue. There is a notion that if one doesn’t know English one can’t go higher in life. God has decided the time so don’t worry. Our PM didn’t go to a convent school, I am the son of a farmer, former President Abdul Kalam didn’t start his education in English,” he said.

Union minister and city MP Nitin Gadkari, guardian minister Nitin Raut, KKSU VC Shrinivasa Varakhedi, RSS think-tank MG Vaidya, several functionaries of the Sangh and academicians were present.

‘Do chandra namaskar’

Vice President Venkaiah Naidu thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for making ancient Indian traditions like Yoga popular globally. Without naming any specific community or country, Naidu said a child told him she can't do ‘surya namaskar’. “I said toh chandra namaskar kar lo, beta,” said Naidu.

The moon symbolizes the Muslim community and Islamic nations have it on their flags.

487,['11/01/2020'],Chandigarh evaluated as progressive UT in energy efficiency index,"This story is from January 11, 2020

CHANDIGARH: The city has been evaluated as progressive UT in the ‘State Energy Efficiency Index 2019’, which was released on Friday, by Raj Kumar Singh, minister of state (independent charge) for power and new and renewable energy. The index tracks the progress of energy efficiency (EE) initiatives in 36 states and UTs based on 97 indicators. The index was released on the occasion of RPM (Review, Planning and Monitoring) meeting was held in Delhi.

The index is developed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency in association with Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy. It will help states and UTs to contribute towards national goals on energy security and climate action by helping drive EE policies and programme implementation at the state and local level, tracking progress in managing the states and India’s energy footprint and institutionalising the data capture and monitoring of EE activities by states.

The report stated, “Adoption of electric vehicles in public transportation by states is at an incipient stage. States like Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh, have incorporated electric buses in their fleet as a pilot initiative. On penetration of electric passenger vehicles (number of electric and hybrid vehicles sold between 2014-15 and 2018-19 as a percentage of total vehicles registered during the same period), Kerala tops the states at 2.3% compared to the national average of 0.3%. Chandigarh and Dadra & Nagar Haveli are two other UTs with EV penetration of more than 1%”.

UT working on promoting e-vehicles

The administration is also working on promoting hybrid and electric vehicles. Three years ago, a team of the transport department had visited Nagpur to study charging stations’ set-up. Nagpur was the first city in the country to have in place electric vehicle charging stations. Chandigarh has the highest density of vehicles in India with around 12 lakh registered ones, including two-wheelers and fourwheelers. The number of vehicles per house on an average is two, which has led to a sharp deterioration in air quality.

To cut down the pollution level, Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) will induct electric buses. At present, around 3,000 e-rickshaws are plying in the city.

For rational comparison, states/UTs are grouped into four groups based on aggregated Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES) required to meet the state’s actual energy demand (electricity, coal, oil, gas) across sectors. TPES grouping shall help states compare performance and share best practices within their peer group. Under four categories based on TPES, Haryana, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Puducherry and Chandigarh have been evaluated as progressive states/UTs in the State Energy Efficiency Index 2019.

INDORE: Unidentified persons broke into house number 55C in Tejaji Nagar and made away with cash and jewellery worth lakhs on Friday. The house is adjacent to 54C owned by CK Patle, retired SP of central excise and customs which was ransacked in September this year. Three masked men had barged into the house of the retired CK Patle in Brijnayni colony of Tejaji Nagar and had fled with jewellery and cash worth Rs 3 lakh.

In a similar incident, the accused broke into the house of one Ajay Mishra, a businessman, and stole cash and jewellery and ransacked the house. Mishra was out for work and his wife, a teacher was also at school when the incident took place.

When the wife returned home in the afternoon she saw the lock broken and items missing following which they approached Tejaji Nagar police.

Officials said that a case has been registered and they were looking at CCTV footage of nearby areas to ascertain identity of accused but there is a suspicion that the accused were tribals from Dhar district .

In September, the accused had broken into Patle’s house around 3.30 am, when his wife Sheela was sleeping in the bedroom on the ground floor, while CK Patle was sleeping in the bedroom on first floor. When Sheela got up at around 3.30 am, she found three men with covered faces and rods in their hands in her bedroom on ground floor searching for valuables. They threatened to kill her if she tried to call for help. The woman kept sitting on her bed and after the accused left, she raised alarm. Tejaji Nagar police had in November arrested the accused.

PUNE: A sessions court has discharged the architect and dropped the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against the structural engineer of the Narhe building that collapsed on October 31, 2014.

A 29-year-old software analyst was killed in the collapse of the six-storied ‘Pitaram Complex’ building, while eight families who had purchased/rented flats in the scheme were rendered homeless.

Additional sessions judge GP Agrawal, in an order on Thursday, said the structural engineer, Bal Kulkarni, be tried for the offence under Section 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

“Section 304-A carries a lesser punishment of up to two years as against the maximum sentence of life term provided in Section 304-II (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC in case of a conviction,” Kulkarni’s lawyer Rohit Dangare told TOI.

In case of architect Shekhar alias Shankar Dnyanoba Whalekar, the court held that his role was limited up to preparation of the plan and obtaining necessary approval. “That, quality of construction work, structural stability, use of material of construction does not come within the domain of architect. There is no material to show that, accused number five (Whalekar) conspired with the other accused to cheat and in furtherance of the same forged documents to benefit himself and committed offence of culpable homicide,” judge Agrawal observed.

Two partners of realty firm VK Associates, which had constructed the building, a labour contractor and the land owners were among total seven persons booked in the case. It is the police’s case that the building was constructed in violation of building rules and bye laws. The police then invoked charges under sections 304 (culpable homicide), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 420 (cheating), 427 (mischief causing damage to property), 467, 468 and 471 (all related to forgery) and 120-B (conspiracy) of the IPC. All the seven accused are out on bail.

Whalekar and Kulkarni had filed separate pleas for discharge from the case, citing various grounds contesting their culpability in the case.

Their lawyers, Sachin Jadhav and Dangare, had cited the Supreme Court’s observation in the Keshub Mahindra vs State of MP case relating to the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, in which it was held that even after taking the entire material in the chargesheet at its face value, and assuming it to be representing correct factual position in connection with the operation of the plant, still there was no prima facie case for framing a charge in respect of an offence punishable under Section 304-II IPC and, that, a prima facie case existed only in respect of an offence punishable under Section 304-A IPC.

Referring to the arguments and evidence on record, judge Agrawal held that the ratio laid down in the Bhopal Gas Tragedy case, squarely applied to the instant case and held that the structural engineer cannot be tried for offence under Section 304-II, but be prosecuted for offence under Section 304-A. Since, the architect’s role was limited to preparing and getting the plan sanctioned, he got the benefit of discharge from the case.

PUNE: The directors and office-bearers of a tour company were booked on Thursday on the charge of duping 17 people of Rs20.85 lakh on the pretext of arranging overseas tours and offering lucrative returns on their investment in the firm.

The action was taken after an investor, Vishwajit Yenkikar (36) of Vadgaon Budruk, lodged an FIR with the Alankar police. Yenkikar had invested Rs2.65 lakh in the company. The firm’s representatives were unavailable when Yenkikar tried to contact them in the first week of January to check the status of his investment and the promised benefits, the officer said.

“Prima facie probed revealed that the suspects had taken money from 17 people. They have been accepting money from December 2018. In the first week of January, they shut their office in Kothrud and fled,” assistant inspector Shivprasad Khose of the Alankar police said.

The suspects have been booked under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code .

“The suspects had started their office in Kothrud in 2018. Their sales representative used to contact people and lure them into investing in their company by offering domestic and overseas tour packages. They also promised other privilege benefits,” Khose said.

The tour operator failed to fulfil the commitment and did not return the booking amount, the assistant inspector said.

“We have launched a search for them,” Khose added.

BENGALURU: Twenty-eight students on an average committed suicide every 24 hours during 2018, the highest in a decade in which India lost nearly 82,000 of them, according to a National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data analysis. Of the 81,758 students who committed suicide from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2018, 57% killed themselves in the past five years, including 10,159 in 2018, the data revealed.

Overall, India saw 1.3 lakh suicides in 2018, of which students made up for 8%, almost the same as those involved in the farming sector, while 10% of them were unemployed people. A quarter of the student suicides in 2018 were because of ""failure in exams"". Experts said causes ranged from drugs to depression, to broken families and breakups.

While psychologists say clinical depression, schizophrenia and other mental health issues and addiction to drugs and alcohol are the three most common reasons, sociologists and rights activists call it a psycho-social problem.

Sociologist Samata Deshmane pointed out that people, especially students, are finding it difficult to cope with the transformation in society. Arguing that human beings are ""social animals"", she said, ""But today, we are less social and more individualists.""

State-wise analysis of student suicides in 2018 shows that just five of them - Maharashtra (1,448), Tamil Nadu (953), Madhya Pradesh (862), Karnataka (755) and West Bengal (609) - account for 45%, or 4,627 cases.

Between 2014 and 2018, the same five states, along with Chhattisgarh in two years, have accounted for the highest number of cases.

Child Rights Trust director Nagasimha G Rao argues that students, especially those over the age of 10, don't have avenues to vent, which makes it difficult to manage stress. Dr M S Dharmendra, consultant psychiatrist, Manasa Neuropsychiatric Hospital, had earlier told TOI there are multiple factors, including sociological, psychological and biological factors.

""It all depends on how they are able to handle stress, how they perceive a situation. There are biological factors too as we are all born with certain predispositions to depression,"" he said.

Our genetic makeup gives us some vulnerability to depression. Some have low vulnerability and in a few others it may be high,"" he said.

PUNE: An Ahmedabad-Pune SpiceJet flight was diverted to Mumbai on Thursday evening following “temporary closure of the runway” at the city airport, resulting in three-hour delay.

“SpiceJet Flight SG 523 operating from Ahmedabad to Pune on January 9 was diverted to Mumbai due to temporary runway closure at the Pune airport . The flight reached the destination after the runway was available for normal operations,” a SpiceJet spokesperson told TOI.

The runway of the Pune airport is managed by the Indian Air Force (IAF), authorities of which could not be reached for their comments on the issue till going to the press.

The flight took off from Ahmedabad at 7.28pm, eight-minute after its scheduled departure.

It was supposed to land at the Pune airport by 8.20pm, following which it was to fly back to Ahmedabad as SG-524 at 8.50pm.

A passenger travelling by the return Pune-Ahmedabad flight said, “The flight (SG-524) was supposed to take off from the Pune airport at 8.50pm. However, it was delayed by three hours and eventually took off at 11.50pm.”

“The airline staffers kept giving us all kinds of excuses for the delay. They also behaved rudely with many passengers,” the passenger said.

The runway of the Pune airport is generally closed from 8am to 10.30am every day to facilitate operations of IAF.

On Saturdays, the runway is shut from 11am to 5am for maintenance. Only on rare occasions, the IAF shuts the runway down at any time other than the ones mentioned above.

No other flight reported any diversion during the alleged runway closure time.

Sunil Nave (with black ink on his shirt) after the attack

NASHIK: A section of irked BJP workers allegedly heckled and threw black ink on the organisational secretary of the Jalgaon unit of the party, Sunil Nave, in presence of Union minister Raosaheb Danve and former state water resources minister Girish Mahajan.

The 17-member core committee of the Jalgaon district BJP and party workers had gathered at a hall in Jalgaon city on Friday afternoon for the election of the new Jalgaon district (rural) president.

Nave told TOI that at about 2pm, when the process to decide the new district (rural) party chief kicked off, some party workers suddenly rushed to the dais, where the core committee members were sitting, and started raising slogans against him.

The core committee includes Danve, Mahajan, two local MPs, current and former MLAs from the district. However, former revenue minister Eknath Khadse, who is also a part of the core team, was not present.

Nave said that these irked party members were anguished that they were not considered for the post of the Bhusawal city president although they had filed their applications for the post. The new BJP city president was appointed about a week back.

“They thought that I was instrumental in ignoring their candidatures. Suddenly, they climbed onto the dais and started beating me. While I was reasoning with them, they suddenly threw black ink on me. There was utter chaos at the venue. They had come prepared to target me in the meeting,” said Nave, adding that Danve and Mahajan witnessed the happening.

There were about 11 BJP candidates who were interested for the post for the Bhusawal city president. “However, the core committee decided to appoint Dinesh Namade for that post, although he did not file application. I had no role in finalising the candidate for that post,” he claimed.

As utter chaos unfolded, Mahajan came down from the dais and pacified the annoyed party workers. Nave has not lodged any police complaint so far stating that it was internal matter of the party.

“Danve has taken strong exception about the development and he has assured those responsible would be expelled from the party,” added Nave.

Later, the core committee had a meeting and decided to appoint former MLA from Raver, Haribhau Jawale, as the new district (rural) president of the party.

A sapling on the verge of perishing on LU campus

LUCKNOW: A hundred saplings of peepal and neem planted on the grounds of Lucknow University to mark its centenary celebrations did not last even for 100 days, thanks to the negligence of university authorities.

Planted on November 25, LU’s foundation day, only two of 100 saplings have survived, revealed a reality check by TOI on Friday.

While planting these saplings, university professors had taken an oath to take care of them and make LU the greenest educational campus in the city. However, 98 saplings planted in the parking lot opposite physics and chemistry departments and Canning College building have dried up.

The two which survived include one at gate number two that was planted under the shade of a big tree. The other one was opposite the political science department where a tea stall vendor keeps watering the plant regularly.

“Most saplings dried because they were not planted properly. Rather than digging deep enough to accommodate roots before levelling it with mud, the plantation was done superficially. As a result, most dried within a few days. Some in the parking lot were crushed by the movement of vehicles,” said a parking lot attendant at gate number two. A senior professor, admitting negligence in care of plants, said, “The decision of plantation was taken in haste by the university authorities at the eleventh hour because no other event was planned for the centenary year foundation day on November 25.”

LU spokesperson Sanjay Medhavi said there was laxity in care of plantation. However, he said this would not be repeated. “LU has planned to plant 2,600 saplings on Republic Day on the main and second campuses. This time, teachers and students will be given responsibility individually to take care of plants,” he said.

CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Friday directed the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption ( DVAC ) to file a status report on the preliminary inquiry conducted on its complaint alleging corruption by the Greater Chennai Corporation in awarding tenders for paving roads and constructing storm water drains across the city.

A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemalatha passed the interim order on a public interest litigation (PIL) moved by Arappor Iyakkam, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), seeking to register an FIR against the commissioner based on its complaint. The bench also directed the NGO to add local administration minister S P Velumani as a respondent since the corporation comes under his portfolio and adjourned the case to February 19 for further hearing.

Arappor Iyakkam’s PIL said it had lodged a complaint with the DVAC on November 1, 2108, seeking criminal action against the corporation commissioner for alleged violations in awarding tenders for relaying 3,800 existing bus route roads and internal roads at an estimated Rs 300 crore.

Since no action was taken even a year after the completion of the project, the NGO moved the present plea.

In its submission, the DVAC said the preliminary inquiry began on March 11, 2019, and sought time to file a status report. Earlier, the NGO said the authorities also committed a fraud in pricing. The tender was awarded on the condition that river sand would be used. However, all the work was done with the much cheaper M-sand, it added, urging the court to constitute a special investigation team to probe the case and to monitor it.
