0,['7/01/2020'],"Mayakkum Margazhi: Kumaresh and I want to play together, but we don’t want to sound like one, says Ganesh","It is always a delight to speak to eminent violinists Ganesh and Kumaresh. Their easy camaraderie and banter liven up their conversation. Before we could proceed with our Arattai Kutcheri, Ganesh had one question to ask Kumaresh — on his love for bikes. “When you take off on your bike, do you think of us?” asked Ganesh. “Well, music has aesthetics, energy and is dynamic. But I also want power… of course, it is there in music. But I look for more and that is accomplished through my rides. Speed thrills me. I have always been adventurous,” replied Kumaresh, and asked his sibling why he didn’t like riding. Ganesh said with a laugh, “I enjoy slowness.” Well, that’s how the brothers are — they share the same passion, and yet complement each other on the choices they make. Excerpts from their conversation…Kumaresh: You have been playing for over 50 years now. What does music mean to you?Ganesh: We are all talking right now to express something, right? Well, I don’t do that. I express through music. When I play music, I feel something is talking to me. But I don’t know if others will understand it in the same way. I feel it’s a language. When I play a raga, I will play it like a story. It is my way of expressing something. When we express something through words, I feel we miss out on a lot as it could be lost in translation. We lose out on that emotion. We’ve been playing together for so many years now and there have been times when we both want to try the same sangathi at that particular moment. I would want to communicate that to you (looks at Kumaresh) and you would have picked up that sangathi without even me having to explain it to you through words. (looks at us) He is that fast!Kumaresh: I have learnt a lot from anna. When we are playing together, he will expect me to be there before he finishes one sangathi. I have to be sharp. If I don't, he will get angry. Ganesh: Ellarum enna shantha swaroobi-nu enachindu irrupa...Kumaresh: Kovam kuda oru improvisation la kattuvar (laughs).Ganesh: Ok, I have question for you. When you play, there is a lot of rhythmic energy. Do you apply the same when you play the aalap as well?Kumaresh: I don’t think like that. Even when I was young, I didn’t plan anything and just went with the flow. I like rhythm and have learnt the mridangam. But somehow, I stuck to violin. You can play everything in violin. Anna will say layam is not just about rhythmic patterns, but it is the mesmerising factor. Music complements layam and vice versa. When we play ragam, we gradually build the raga and pep it up from the pace where we started. We slow down if it becomes fast. All these are rhythmic expressions. But I haven’t thought of these like that… I don’t have an analytical mind; I have an experienced mind. Knowledge is not for me; experience is for me (laughs).Kumaresh: You’ve been performing for decades now. Has your enthusiasm remained the same since then?Ganesh: Well, the energy is different, but the enthusiasm is still intact. At that time, it was more to do with what we have learnt and doing it properly. I used to have so many things on my mind and it was restricted just in my thoughts. Today, it is not like that. I can play whatever I want as I know I have a command over it. Initially, I used to be enthusiastic about music, and now, music gives me that enthusiasm.Ganesh: So, who have been your inspirations?Kumaresh: I have many inspirations. But there is a thin line between inspiration and influence. So many people like Lalgudi Jayaraman mama, MS Gopalakrishnan mama, Vikku Vinayakram mama, Zakir Hussain bhai and you have inspired me. I like one thing about each person… like Lalgudi mama’s soul, MSG mama’s control over the instrument and Zakir bhai’s flamboyance. But only when you move closer with that person do you know what kind of personality he is. Vinayakaram mama na… upapakkavathiyam-nu solra ghatam-a he brought it to limelight. So, each of them have inspired me in many ways. Today, I am my own inspiration as certain things I do inspire me and makes me go ‘wow’. It is not arrogance, it is not ego, but a self-belief that I can do anything. There are no limits as they are only in your mind. Playing with anna is not easy at all. I think I can do it, which is why I am able to do it. So, we need to have that self-belief. So, I inspire myself now.Kumaresh: In all sabhas, we have photos of saints Tyagaraja, Shyama Shastri and Muthuswami Dikshitar. Don’t you think it’s about time they have photos of TNR (Thirumarugal Natesapillai Rajarathinam Pillai), Balamuralikrishna mama, Madurai Mani Iyer, Palakkad Mani Iyer and other giants from the 19th century?Ganesh: Enna maativittutta... (laughs)Kumaresh: It is just an observation…Ganesh: We should have their photos. But we have huge respect for saints, and all those musicians have earned that. They are not just singers or instrumentalist, they are naada yogis. Naada bindu kaladi namo namaha solluvom la… they have gone into the vibration of sound and found it. Athma dhyanam kadaicha gnyani ava. To have their photos in the sabhas is only fair. But the pictures of the great musicians you mentioned should be present in books. Musicians or music connoisseurs would obviously know these stalwarts, but the general public must also be aware of these greatest musicians of the Carnatic world. If I ask any kid if they know S Balachander, they would ask if it is KB (director K Balachander) sir. Take for instance TNR mama (TN Rajarathnam Pillai); there are so many interesting stories about him. Rasikas used to say how he would be lost to the world when he plays the nadaswaram. We should pass such anecdotes to the next generation. They should be celebrated, too. We all know Michael Jackson, but how many of us know our own giants?Kumaresh: Ok, let’s talk about Ragapravaham. We have been doing it for over 25 years – how’s the journey?Ganesh: To begin with, Ragapravaham is an important tool to express yourself as a musician. Unfortunately, in Carnatic music, ellame paadra maathiriye vasikkanum-nu oru tradition vandhuduthu. It wasn’t the case earlier. Music was born because of instruments. God and Goddesses like Saraswati and Krishna had veena and flute. Gods played instrumental music. So, who sings? We, devotees, sing. Gods play instruments and devotees sing in praise of them. Instrumentalists should think musically. Ragapravaham is expressing oneself as a musician in that form. We have adopted compositions in such a way that it has no lyrics, but have ragam, rhythm and thalam. When I play something, you don’t have to feel what I feel, as you have the freedom to interpret it the way you want. That is the beauty of music. I’m sure people would then ask, ‘how will everyone learn music?’ We are creating a completely new syllabus for violin where it doesn’t involve lyrics at all. We teach ragam, gamakam and all other aspects of music and violin play, so that children don’t have the burden of learning the lyrics.Kumaresh: Someone who doesn’t know Telugu learns Telugu songs. The bhavam will be different for him when he sings a Telugu song as opposed to when he sings a song in his mother tongue. This becomes difficult especially for kids. You are killing their enthusiasm. So, we teach them to play with the sound and when we give these melodies, they love it. We never asked musicians from the previous generation what their idea of music is. What we are doing now is an interpretation of music. When a critic interprets my music, it will be based on what he knows. But my experience is different. Usually, in the West, critics would have also studied music and he’d know everything about, say, Beethoven’s compositions. Here, many have learnt the words. For instance, if I play music in a different way or I want to add a sangathi to a keerthanai, critics wonder why. It limits the art form.Ganesh: In the late 70s, there used to be at least four instrumental concerts among the 10 that a sabha organises. Today, after slotting all the 10 concerts, they think of including an instrumental performance. Some try to bring all the instrumentalists together and have an ensemble concert. It loses its significance that way. However, Ragapravaham will be the future of music. If there’s a duet concert, both the artistes end up sounding the same. Kumaresh and I want to play together, but we don’t want to sound like one. Instead, we want to complement each other.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73123667,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1246389/73123667.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/mayakkum-margazhi-kumaresh-and-i-want-to-play-together-but-we-dont-want-to-sound-like-one-says-ganesh/articleshow/73123667.cms
1,['7/01/2020'],"Can express ourselves better in Kannada, say Bengaluru student rappers","Music, it is said, helps people express themselves; even more so when it is in your mother tongue. At a time when youngsters are often chided for following all things Western, it comes as a pleasant surprise that an increasing number of young student artistes in Bengaluru are opting to express themselves in their mother tongue, especially Kannada. So much so that even rap, which has been thought to be only for the English-speaking crowd, is getting a desi twist, with many rappers showcasing their prowess with numbers in Kannada. What’s more is that the medium is also being used by these artistes to express their thoughts on life, social causes and so much more, making rapping more than just singing.“I rap in both Kannada and English, but since my mother tongue is Kannada, expressing my thoughts sometimes comes easier to me in it. I believe that rapping in Kannada allows me to express myself better. I follow Eminem and I used to rap predominantly in English, but then I realised that I can do it a lot better in Kannada and so, I began performing in both the languages,” says Nitin Savio, a student from St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous)Kevin Lourd, a first-year student from NITTE Meenakshi Institute of Technology, who prefers to rap in Kannada and Tamil, echoes this and adds, “Rapping is all about the artiste, where he/she comes from and his/her roots. As a rapper, I believe it is important to stick to your roots. That way, not only is your story authentic, but it also helps you express better.”“Kannada is a very powerful language and the best way to showcase our culture is through music, especially if it’s performed in in our mother tongue,” says Shivakumar, a student of Government Ramnarayan Chellaram College of Commerce and Management. Rapping in a vernacular language, he adds, also means that extra effort is put into the quality and originality of the compositions. “Considering that this is our effort in doing our bit for a performing art in Kannada, the focus has been on quality of work. We spend time on writing the lyrics and don’t do rush jobs, so that we can make a substantial contribution to the Kannada rap scene in the city,” he says.The beauty of rap, says Shivakumar, is that it is a good way to introduce other students to Kannada. “Rap, as an art, is such that the beats and the rhythm attract listeners. So, when we perform in Kannada, not only do they enjoy the music, but also try to understand the lyrics. Performing in Kannada is our way of taking the language to greater heights,” he says.Performing in Kannada and getting an audience is a lot of hard work, though, adds Nitin. “Normally, we start off with some popular numbers to set the tone. Once we know for sure that the audience is paying attention, we introduce them to our original compositions, which are songs about us, our city and culture,” says Nitin. Kevin adds, “If we are not original and don’t connect with what we sing, there is no way that the audience will connect with us. I’m an 18 year old, rapping about what someone my age goes through, the struggles and more. But that can change depending on the audience.”Kannada rapper All.OK is very impressed with the trend of youngsters taking up the art form, and that too in Kannada. But he has a word of advice for aspiring rappers. “Originality is the key to make a mark. Do not copy other rappers and create your own style. If you are serious about taking it up professionally, you need to have a strong understanding of the language that you choose to perform in. This helps with the word flow, as rapping is about putting rhyming words out there in a rhythm,” he says.MC BijuRahul DittoAll.OKChandan Shetty",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73121653,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-294940/73121653.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/can-express-ourselves-better-in-kannada-say-bengaluru-student-rappers/articleshow/73121653.cms

While work on the revival of his Maanaadu with Venkat Prabhu is underway, STR will be releasing a single, which he has composed, written and sung, this February.The song, a source tells us, will be on a subject that the 90s kids, who proudly call themselves ‘ morattu singles ’, will identify with — relationship! “These 90s kids are either angry at the 80s kids or jealous of the 2K kids when it comes to relationships.

Representative image

CHANDIGARH: Punjab has become first state in the country to get a government-run Ayurvedic drug de-addiction centre.

The Union ministry of Ayush has approved the Punjab government's proposal to start an Ayurvedic drug de-addiction centre, which will come up at Amritsar's Ayurvedic government hospital.

The ministry has sanctioned a grant of Rs 1.5 crore for the project, which it aims to replicate in other parts of the country.

The development assumes significance as Punjab is grappling with the problem of drug abuse and is home to about 7.2 lakh addicts. The Centre will give much-needed alternative treatment options to the addicts who at present are being treated with opioid substitution therapy (OST) by giving buprenorphine.

Confirming the development, Dr Manoj Nesari, joint adviser ( Ayurveda ), Ayush, said Punjab's proposal has been accepted and it is the first state where such an initiative has been taken. To work out the modalities, the ministry held series of meeting with the Punjab government officials, including the chief secretary.

Sharing details, Dr Nesari stated treatment protocol, which focuses on treating patients through Ayurvedic medicines, yoga, exercises, meditation and counselling, has been prepared by a team of doctors led by Dr Rakesh Sharma, director, Ayurveda, Punjab, in consultation with the Ayush ministry.

As per the treatment protocol, patients will be admitted to the hospital for a period of three months. After they are discharged, regular follow-ups at short intervals will be done for six months to avoid relapse.

Five-step panchkarma therapies for mind and body rejuvenation, yoga and meditation sessions and psychological counselling of all the patients is part of the treatment protocol.

""Addiction is a mental problem and Ayurveda has a lot of potential to treat addiction,"" said Dr Nesari, who had in past run a similar programme in a Mumbai-based hospital. The Punjab health department will purchase medicines and these will be provided free of cost to the addicts.

Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the Ayurvedic drug de-addiction centre will provide alternative treatment to addicts which has no side effects. ""Depending upon the success of the project, there is plan to open more such centres in the state,"" said Sidhu.

APPLIED FOR LICENCE

Punjab Ayurveda department has initiated the process for obtaining licence required to run the de-addiction centre. The licence is issued by the health department.

THE ACTION PLAN

The patients will be put on treatment after diagnosis on basis of history and symptoms, such as body aches (Sharirdukha), hallucinations (arupanaamstam darshnam), thirst (trishna), anorexia (aruchi), lassitude (sharm), delirium (sammoh), yawning (jambhai), palpitations (safuran), trembling (vepanm), and loss of sleep (prajagr).

CHALLENGE AT HAND

The ill-effects of addiction to drugs like opium and cannabis have been described in Ayurveda. However, there is no description of hazards of semi-synthetic\synthetic drugs derived from natural or chemical sources in Ayurveda.

Shimla meteorological centre has warned of thunderstorm accompanied with hail and lighting at isolated places in these districts.Fresh spell of rain and snow has further intensified cold conditions in Himachal Pradesh. Many parts of state received rain and snow on Monday, plummeting the temperature further.According to Shimla meteorological centre director Manmohan Singh, a fresh Western Disturbance has approached the state whose impact would be visible for next two days — Tuesday and Wednesday. He said heavy snowfall is expected in the higher reaches of Shimla, Sirmaur, Mandi, Chamba and Kangra and Kullu districts beside Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti during next two days. Besides, middle and low hills of the state will witness rain and hailstorm during next two.Shimla deputy commissioner Amit Kashyap said all roads in Shimla urban area were open for vehicular traffic and have even been covered with sand to avoid any untoward incident. He said snow clearing operations were going on a war-footing on Dhalli-Kufri, Kufri-Chail, Mashobra-Bhekalti, Shimla-Theog roads, which are blocked due to snowfall. The district administration has deployed adequate JCB machinery to ensure smooth traffic flow at the earliest.Kashyap said snow clearing work on roads was on at Khadapathar, Tikkar, Khadrala, Sungri and Chopal areas. He added that HRTC buses were not plying in snowbound upper Shimla areas and were taking Basantpur route for Rampur.He said there was adequate stock of essential commodities in the far-flung areas of the district including Dodra Kwar subdivision and there was no need for any panic.Over 300 tourist vehicles were stranded in Solang valley, between Solang and Kulang village, late on Monday evening after the vehicles started slipping on snow.The road between Kulang and Solang is covered under 10-25cm of snow and snowfall was still continuing in the area. The road became slippery due to heavy snow and vehicles started skidding.Even as snow is accumulating on the highway at a very fast rate, police were confident that all vehicles would be moved to safety.Mild cold conditions prevailed in Punjab after overnight rains. Amritsar, Ludhiana and Patiala recorded their respective lows at 8.2 degrees Celsius, 10 degrees Celsius and 10.7 degrees Celsius, up to five degrees above the normal.

Varun couldn’t stop gushing over his city. He said, “Whenever I’m in Lucknow, I feel very positive and lively. I ensure that I have Tundey kebabs and biryani here. They are to die for and I’m a foodie who absolutely loves non-vegetarian food. Apart from this, I have fond memories of Hazratganj where I would chill with my friends while bunking college. We would watch films there and dawdle around. Those were some of the best times.” Varun was working in a corporate job before venturing into acting. He shared, “I started my career as a software engineer but was always inclined towards acting, right from childhood. Soon after realising that I wasn’t being fair to my passion, I decided to try my hand at modelling and acting. After winning a few modelling competitions, I moved to Mumbai. There I was offered my first role in the hit show Bepannah, which I believe was a fabulous start to my acting career. Somehow my acting was appreciated in that show and after that I was offered more shows like' Yeh Hai Mohabbatein', ' Kundali Bhagya ', etc. Post a couple of shows I was given my first film 'Utavle Bavle' directed by Snehal Dabi. So I think the journey has been great so far.”After playing several negative roles, Varun expressed his desire to play a positive role onscreen. The actor said, “I think my eyes give me a slightly villainous look and probably because of that I’m mostly offered negative roles. Although I would love to do a positive role personally, I can’t say ‘no’ to the work coming my way either.”— Yashi Agarwal",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73123462,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1010632/73123462.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/i-have-fond-memories-of-bunking-college-with-my-friends-and-going-to-hazratganj-actor-varun-joshi/articleshow/73123449.cms
20,['7/01/2020'],"Dheeraj Dhoopar: Work is important, but I can’t ignore my personal life","While most TV actors often complain about not getting enough time for themselves, Dheeraj Dhoopar has mastered the art of balancing his personal and professional life. Though he is busy shooting for his show, ' Kundali Bhagya ', he makes sure to spend quality time with actress wife Vinny Arora , who he tied the knot with three years ago. The couple go on short vacays every six months to keep the zing alive in their marriage. Dheeraj says, “Work is important, but I can’t ignore my personal life. I shoot extra hours before going on every holiday.” And what about embracing parenthood? He replies, “Vinny and I would love to have a baby, but not immediately. We want to enjoy life a little more as a couple before we start a family.”On the work front, Dheeraj does aspire to test waters in Bollywood. However, he would rather wait for the right project. “Talks are on, but nothing is concrete. Everyone has their own journey — some get their chance relatively early, while others have to first prove their mettle on other mediums. I don’t want to compromise on my acting just to be seen on the big screen,” he shares.As someone who has been a part of showbiz for almost 12 years, what does he have to say about the fact that an actor’s popularity lasts only till his show? He says, “Well, I have survived in the industry for 12 years. There are times when a show meets with an unexpected fate. A few of my shows, too, wrapped up within three months, but things changed after ' Sasural Simar Ka ' ('SSK'), which I was a part of for six years. And now, I am doing 'Kundali Bhagya' for the last three years. I agree that the success of your show matters, but I have survived by working continuously and honing my craft. My ability to take risks has also contributed to it. I had no offers when I quit 'SSK'. I had got married then and had just returned from my honeymoon. My family and friends warned me against it. It’s easy to doubt yourself when those around you are not in agreement with your decision, but you have to believe in yourself. I’m grateful to Vinny for supporting me during that phase.”While Dheeraj has no inhibitions about getting intimate on screen, he says that he won’t do it just to grab eyeballs. “I have really got the best partner in life, and she encourages me to push boundaries all the time. However, whatever we do, including going bold on screen, should be worth it. In today’s time, people are selling just about anything by showing nudity and titillating the audience. I would be okay performing an intimate scene or locking lips if the script demands it,” he signs off.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73124213,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-71832/73124213.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/dheeraj-dhoopar-work-is-important-but-i-cant-ignore-my-personal-life/articleshow/73124194.cms
21,['7/01/2020'],"Ajay Devgn: You don’t need big budgets to make big films, you need intelligence’","It takes a lot of courage to make a film based on a historical figure. It needs time, patience, passion and of course, big monies to see an ambitious idea make its way to the silver screen. Ajay Devgn, a supremely talented actor and sharp producer, who marks his 100th film with 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior', stresses that India might not have the big budgets of Hollywood, but it has talent galore. And he swears by his sword that with this film, he wants to prove that. Read on…When I played Bhagat Singh, I remember that the film lingered with me for a long time. And it stays with you because they were great people and you know that you can’t be like them. You wonder what his mindset was and what was he thinking when he made those sacrifices. When you watch a film, you can even assume for a moment that this is fictional, but to sit back and think that someone actually did all this in reality, is unthinkable. When I heard about Tanhaji and the way he fought for the country, I realised that if he wasn’t there, the map of India would have changed. He became a local hero. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is known across the country for his heroism. Tanhaji is known mostly in Maharashtra and what we know of him is mostly through school textbooks, and that, too, is limited to probably a small paragraph. It is also not part of textbooks across all boards of education. My children didn’t study about him in school, some of us did.Yes! Today, we are talking about Tanhaji from Maharashtra, tomorrow, it could be a hero from Punjab or Rajasthan. In fact, they will not necessarily belong to only a certain era, we could have unsung heroes from this era, too. There could be heroes who didn’t go to the battlefield, but have done something commendable for our society. There are so many such stories that are relevant in today’s times. That’s how the idea came about, and I want to take stories of such heroes to the audience around the world. We have so many such inspiring stories in India. I am not saying that after watching the film you will become like Tanhaji, you cannot. But, at least, we will know how much effort and pain has gone into our struggle for freedom, so that we learn to respect it. The other part is, when we make films, we try to make commercial movies with a great screenplay, which will intrigue and grip you. So, when I heard the script, I felt that even if I was making a fictional drama on a subject of this nature, the story I would be looking for would be something like this. Even if you treat this like a fiction drama, it works perfectly.I have always done this in my productions, right from films like 'Hindustan Ki Kasam' (1999) and ' Raju Chacha ' (2000). There is always a ‘first’ that we have done in the industry. In the film 'Pyaar Toh Hona Hi Tha' in 1998 (which was 50 per cent my production), it was the first time that a film had a musical promotional video. Back then, there was no such trend of promotional song videos. Now, everyone is doing it. I was always technically very strong, thanks to my father. I have always strived to take things notches higher. Yes, for a film like this you need heavy budgets, but if you are sensible, smart and invest time wisely (we have been working on this film for four years and we shot for 8-9 months), you are sorted. If you are smart, then you don’t need that kind of budgets. This is what I want to prove with this film, that you don’t need big budgets to make big films, you need to be smart and intelligent. The budget of this film would be like any other big-budget film being made here. It’s not that we have gone haywire with budgets, it’s like any other big-scale movie. When you see the quality of the film, you will know that it is the kind of stuff you have not seen being done in India before. The kind of 3D we have in the film, it is what you would have seen in Avengers or other Hollywood films. And it is all done by Indians. Except, for 2-3 action experts, who were with me during ' Shivaay ', too, as I am comfortable with them when it comes to action, everything else has been done here, within our budget.It was my idea to get him on board. I have been watching the film during post-production, and from what I have seen, Saif is outstanding in the film. He has taken over the film. We needed someone like him to play this character, who is quirky, evil and has a personality that can stand tall in front of the protagonist. You see, in a film like Avengers, too, the villain is stronger than all of them put together. Everyone knows that Tanhaji was a great warrior, I don’t have to try too hard to show that as we are aware of his bravery. I need to show who is he fighting with, and what makes him so great. The antagonist needed to have a powerful presence on screen and we have really worked on Saif’s look and style. Earlier, we thought of casting someone new to play Udaybhan. Then it struck me that if we took someone who has played a villain before, then it would not be as exciting. Saif brings a certain personality to the character which it needed.He read the script, loved it and said, ‘Give me five great scenes and I will do it.’ Eventually, he had about 20, so I guess it all worked out well.Yes, I want to share that vision with the audience, and personally, I love doing it, too. I want to show people that, so what if we don’t have the budgets that the West has, we have the talent here. As the budgets scale up, we can do more, but right now, with what we have, we can do what Hollywood does in 2,000 crores. For Tanhaji, playing the character was not as tough as it was being a producer on the project.Yes, the audience has evolved, and they are accepting every kind of cinema. They are liking the kind of films that I believed in during the 90s. People said that I was stupid to do films like 'Thakshak' (1999), 'Zakhm' (1998) and 'Raincoat' (2000). Today, every actor is doing it and it’s working. With multiplexes, that section of the audience is coming in and actors are willing to do all kinds of cinema. It is a great phase for the industry, and we are at a point where we can make what we believe in. In the 90s, actors could not think about switching genres, today, it is accepted.Cuts in…Now, we call it cinema that is ‘high on content’. Even when we are making commercial films, we need to ensure that it has the right kind of drama and sensibility that will appeal to the audience. You can’t put something stupid or mediocre out there and think that it will work. Just because you have a big film (with a big cast), it does not mean that the content does not matter.Different books could state different facts, too. If you are specifically talking about the ghorpad, I know that people might disagree, as scientifically, it does not seem possible. We have followed history, kept all the references, but you have to watch the film to see what we have done with it.Well, we have to justify it and you have to explain it to them. The CBFC is very sensible, and wherever they had a doubt, we gave them all the references required. I don’t need to show the film to his descendants because they have been a part of the shoot. There was an argument about where Tanhaji came from, so we have taken the proof from the family and given it to the CBFC. When you are making a film based on history, you are always walking a thin line. We have to dramatise the story…how else will we tell the story? In history books, you won’t find things like…what did Savitribai (his wife) tell Tanhaji when he was leaving for the battle? So, we have to write that, and fictionalise it. That’s a part of storytelling. Otherwise, there is no screenplay, and the whole story is just one chapter.Honestly, I didn’t realise it was my 100th film, until Om Raut (director of this film) pointed it out. It is a mere coincidence. Today, the industry has become very professional and if I were to compare it to the time when I had started out, it is like two different people. It is like two different industries. Earlier, it wasn’t so professional, of course, it was a lot of fun, which I miss. But now the stakes are too high, and you can’t afford to take it easy. Earlier, we would chill for hours and do masti on set when the shoot was not happening. All that has changed. Now, you have to complete the schedule on time as everything is on a tight budget. Every hour costs money. Personally, I have become more responsible. We used to do 15 films at a time, but now, we are so involved in every project, hence, we are more focused. There is media pressure, too, earlier we never read a review or did promotions of this kind. The film would be slated for release and we were told about it, as simple as that.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73123281,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-82900/73123281.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/ajay-devgn-you-dont-need-big-budgets-to-make-big-films-you-need-intelligence/articleshow/73123263.cms

Varun Joshi (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

Lucknow lad actor Varun Joshi , who rose to fame after playing Manish in the television drama 'Yeh Hai Mohabbatein', recently came to visit his hometown. Varun couldn’t stop gushing over his city. He said, “Whenever I’m in Lucknow, I feel very positive and lively. I ensure that I have Tundey kebabs and biryani here. They are to die for and I’m a foodie who absolutely loves non-vegetarian food. Apart from this, I have fond memories of Hazratganj where I would chill with my friends while bunking college. We would watch films there and dawdle around. Those were some of the best times.”

Varun was working in a corporate job before venturing into acting. He shared, “I started my career as a software engineer but was always inclined towards acting, right from childhood. Soon after realising that I wasn’t being fair to my passion, I decided to try my hand at modelling and acting. After winning a few modelling competitions, I moved to Mumbai. There I was offered my first role in the hit show Bepannah, which I believe was a fabulous start to my acting career. Somehow my acting was appreciated in that show and after that I was offered more shows like' Yeh Hai Mohabbatein', ' Kundali Bhagya ', etc. Post a couple of shows I was given my first film 'Utavle Bavle' directed by Snehal Dabi. So I think the journey has been great so far.”

After playing several negative roles, Varun expressed his desire to play a positive role onscreen. The actor said, “I think my eyes give me a slightly villainous look and probably because of that I’m mostly offered negative roles. Although I would love to do a positive role personally, I can’t say ‘no’ to the work coming my way either.”

Protest against JNU campus violence live updates.

NEW DELHI: Facing flak over their passive role outside the gates of JNU on Sunday when goons were on the rampage inside, and amidst allegations that those who attacked students had been allowed to get away, Delhi Police tried to do damage control on Monday. An FIR was filed and the police chief assigned the investigation to the crime branch. This was after Union home minister Amit Shah asked for a report.On a day marked by expression of widespread outrage across the country and accounts by JNU students of the nightmare on Sunday when no one seemed to be safe, the police said they had received written permission from the university registrar to enter the main campus only at 7.45pm though they had reached the administrative block by 7 pm. The JNU administration had claimed in a statement earlier that the violence had broken around 4.30pm and they had ""immediately"" called the police. No one could explain this three-hour delay which virtually gave the goons a free run of the campus, leading to accusations of complicity and conspiracy.PCR sources said about 50 SOS calls were received by the Delhi Police control room between 4pm and 5pm. The police reached the university and waited for permission even as the violence escalated. The scale was evident with students on Monday seen with bandaged heads, plastered legs and hands, broken fingers and blood-stained clothes. The condition of the men's wing at Sabarmati Hostel indicated the viciousness of the attack.Police officials said they were treading with caution following the Jamia protests when they were accused of using excessive force on students and entering the university without permission. Many men from the junior constabulary said they were asked to avoid confrontation and wait for orders. This, however, didn't square up with their looking the other way when students, teachers, political functionaries and even reporters were being attacked outside the gate by a mob.There was no explanation for the streetlights being switched off either. What's worse, armed goons were still moving around without being challenged by the cops.The police has formed a fact-finding committee headed by joint commissioner (western range) Shalini Singh to probe the response of the police.Asked how so many armed men had managed to enter the university, a senior officer, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""The entry to the JNU complex is from various gates and people who have access or know anyone inside the campus are allowed to go in after security formalities by their own private agency. The gate close to the media institute is small and anyone can jump in and out easily. People can even enter and escape through the jungle area."" The officer added that the cops deployed inside the campus at the administrative block are not armed.Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Singh Randhawa denied any laxity on their part. ""There had been incidents of violence in the campus over the registration process since January 4 due to which a police team was present at the administrative block. However, after 5pm, we had received calls from the hostel areas about scuffles. We can go to this area only with a written permission from the JNU administration. Police initiated action only after permission was received,"" said Randhawa. However, mobile clips from the campus showed youths holding sticks leaving the campus with cops in the vicinity.On Monday, crime branch officials went to the campus and secured CCTV and mobile footage that had been circulated on social media and among students. They will also identify those in the mob who have been recognised by the students and also the unidentified persons amidst allegations that they belonged to ABVP. WhatsApp groups are being scanned and allegations of code words being used by students to identify each other while vandalising the hostels being looked into. The police is also recording the statement of the 34 injured students who have been discharged from hospital. Entries in the register at the gate are also being scrutinised.The FIR in this case, registered under sections of rioting and damaging public property, states that the violence in campus began around 3.45pm. An inspector and a few other cops had been deployed at the administrative block to prevent any protests as per court orders. They were informed that some students were being beaten up at Periyar Hostel. The inspector, who is the complainant in the FIR, has said in his statement that he and others reached the hostel where 40-50 unknown people - with their faces covered with mufflers and clothes - wielding lathis were seen hitting students. They ran away after the police officers arrived.Violence erupted once again around 6.45pm during a march by the teachers after which six PCR teams and cops from the Vasant Kunj police station reached the campus around 7pm. However, they were stopped at the administrative block. Police sources say that when they entered, lights in the campus were switched off and stones were thrown at PCR vehicles too. The cops then had to wait for reinforcements to arrive. During this time, the miscreants also prevented some ambulances from taking away the injured students from the hostels.""At least 50 people were damaging property at the hostel and outside. Through our public announcement system, we requested them to stop the violence and asked them to disperse. Some students started running away, and in between all this, some of the students and professors sustained injuries and sent to hospital,"" said the inspector in the FIR. Only after a written communication was sent by the administration requesting intervention were 200 cops sent in.In Video: Masked goons with lathis climb over JNU hostel walls, beat up students",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73130244,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-384658,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/goons-ran-riot-as-cops-awaited-jnu-nod/articleshow/73130234.cms

NEW DELHI: Heat from rising global temperatures is also singeing India, which experienced its warmest decade (2010-2019) on record, with temperatures in the country 0.36°C higher than average, the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) said.The past year was also the seventh warmest on record and was the 22nd straight year of higher-than-average annual temperatures across the country, IMD's statement on climate of India during 2019, released on Monday, said.In a sign that India was warming in pace with the accelerated rate of global warming in recent years, the average temperature during 2010-2019 was significantly higher than the 0.23°C warming recorded in the previous decade.""The impact of global warming on India is unmistakable,"" IMD head Mrityunjay Mohapatra said.It is also leading to weather extremes, which were quite in evidence in 2019,"" said Mrityunjay Mohapatra, head of IMD.

File photo for representation

MUMBAI: The escalating geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran took a toll on markets around the world, including in India. While global crude prices jumped above the $70-per-barrel level, the sensex closed 788 points or 1.7% lower at 40,677, the rupee weakened below the 72-per dollar mark and gold prices shot up to above Rs 41,000. The day's loss in the sensex-the second biggest in a year-also wiped off investors' wealth worth nearly Rs 3 lakh crore with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 153.5 lakh crore.

A note from Motilal Oswal Securities said Indian markets were badly impacted since Brent crude spiked to a three-month high of $70 and the rupee-dollar conversion rate surged to a two-month high of 72 while gold jumped to a record high in the local market. India is a major importer of crude from West Asia and hence all three factors - tension in the region, rising crude prices and a weak rupee - are negative for the country, more so at a time when it is witnessing an economic slowdown, brokers said.

In the stock market, the sensex opened on a weak note and slid through the session to an intra-day low at 40,614 and closed just a tad higher from that level. Of the 28 index constituents, 30 closed in the red, BSE data showed.

On the positive side for investors, net selling by foreign investors on Monday was just Rs 104 crore while domestic funds were net sellers at only Rs 24 crore. This, in a way, indicates that foreign funds are not selling yet, even after pumping in over $14 billion last year.

According to Amar Ambani, president & head of research, Yes Securities, the current tension should ease in a week or so. ""Our stand is that we are in the middle of a global 'risk-on' trade and an uptrend should resume after a brief pause, unless we see an escalation between the US and Iran. I am more focussed on local issues around the Indian economy and the Union budget, which is around the corner,"" Ambani said. Across the globe too, investors were jittery from the US-Iran face-off and markets were trading weakly.

NEW DELHI: Children excluded from the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, despite one of their parents figuring in the final NRC , will not be separated from their families till their appeals are finally decided by foreigners tribunals, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Monday.

The Centre's response, through attorney general KK Venugopal, was recorded by a bench of CJI SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant. The AG gave the clarification after petitioner's counsel Kapil Sibal said that children, excluded from the NRC despite inclusion of their parents' names, should not be dragged to detention centres.

The bench agreed and said some exception may have to be carved out. The AG said children would not be taken to detention centres even though the SC had asked the government not to tinker with the final NRC statistics.

Sibal also argued a plea for replacement of state NRC coordinator Hitesh Dev Sharma citing his controversial Facebook profile and posts showing his ""communal bias"". ""He has been appointed in place of Prateek Hajela. His social media posts show his bias and he does not inspire confidence,"" Sibal said.

Though solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for Assam, said NRC work was over and the coordinator hardly had any more role to play, the CJI-led bench said the government could ask the coordinator to ""explain, clarify and withdraw"" these comments.

""He should not have said all these things if the alleged social media posts are his,"" the CJI said. The SC asked the Assam government to explain in four weeks.

Venugopal informed the bench that ""there are a few impediments in the NRC going forward"" as the government has to first ensure full security of the massive data. ""This data, like Aadhaar , has to be provided with state-of-the-art security arrangements so as to prevent being breached or hacked by anyone. The SC has already directed such security. This task has to be accomplished,"" he said.

External affairs minister S Jaishankar (Reuters photo)

NEW DELHI: Asserting that the Modi government will not allow terrorism to be normalised, foreign minister S Jaishankar , in a veiled criticism of the UPA, emphasised strategic clarity prevents mistakes like Sharm-el-Sheikh and Havana, controversial formulations seen to have conceded ground to Pakistan over terrorism.

He said joint statements with Pakistan - which generated controversy when UPA was in office - sought to place the perpetrator on the same level as the victim. The difference in approach after the Pathankot attack when the NDA government allowed Pakistan's ISI access to the IAF base for probes, lay in Islamabad accepting the attack originated from Pakistan.

""The probe happened, so Pakistan would not have an excuse to say they had not been given a chance. Government has been clear who the victim is and who is the perpetrator,"" said Jaishankar.

In 2009, the Manmohan Singh-Yousaf Gilani joint statement admitted to a possible Indian role in Balochistan. Three years earlier, shortly after the Mumbai 2006 train bombings , Singh and then Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf issued a joint statement announcing the creation of a joint anti-terror mechanism - which was criticised by the opposition.

Defining India's key interests as territorial integrity and a fight against terrorism, Jaishankar said these are non-negotiables in India's core narrative. Speaking at a book launch on China as a global power, he observed that China, US and erstwhile Soviet Union were all ""problem solvers."" India, he said, has traditionally been adept at kicking the problem down the road, leaving it to the next government or next generation. ""Our instinct is not to home in to a solution.""

On September 28, 2018, a constitution bench had termed the custom unconstitutional and had opened the gates of the Sabarimala temple to all women. More than 50 review petitions were filed against the decision. Without staying the earlier decision, another five-judge bench had on November 14 referred the issue to a seven-judge bench with a request to lay down guidelines for the SC to deal with future litigation.

On December 13, a CJI-led bench had refused to direct the Kerala government to forcibly implement the five-judge bench's verdict till a larger bench reconsidered the judgment.

While refusing to direct implementation of the judgment, the CJI had said, ""I will endeavour to constitute the seven-judge bench at the earliest. If the seven-judge bench decides in your favour, we will surely pass orders (for implementation of the judgment allowing women of all ages to enter Sabarimala temple)."" However, it was not clear what made the CJI change his mind and set up a nine-judge bench.

31,['7/01/2020'],Told Bihar to act against 25 DMs: CBI report to Supreme Court,"This story is from January 7, 2020

NEW DELHI: CBI has told the Supreme Court that government officials failed to perform their duty leading to torture and sexual abuse of children in various shelter homes in Bihar and recommended that the state take action against 25 district magistrates and other government employees.

The agency filed its status report in the apex court and informed that probe against 17 shelter homes have been completed and chargesheet filed in 13 cases. The court had ordered CBI probe against shelter homes after cases of harassment and sexual abuse were reported in 17 of 110 shelter homes which were audited by Tata Institute of Social Sciences(TISS). The institute had put those homes under the category of ""grave concern"" and submitted report to state but no action was taken by the government against them till the Muzaffarpur case came to light.

""Investigation of all 17 shelter home cases has been completed. The final report in 13 regular cases has been filed or forwarded to the competent court. Preliminary enquiry in other four cases has also been completed and no evidence proving commission of criminal offence could be gathered and hence no FIR was registered,"" the affidavit filed by CBI said.

The agency also submitted names of various persons against whom chargesheets have been filed and told the court that it had recommended to the Bihar government to take action against erring government officials. The list includes two DMs each of Gaya, Bhagalpur and Madhubani , three from Patna, one each from Munger, Madhepura and Araria, seven from Motihari and Kaimur and four from Patna. ""The government of Bihar has been requested to take departmental action besides cancellation of registration and blacklisting of NGOs concerned and office-bearers of the NGOs by providing them results of investigation,"" it said. These officers were posted in the district at the time when irregularities were witnessed in the shelter homes.

The apex court is monitoring the probe on a plea of social activists who alleged that many influential people were involved in the ghastly crime against children and free and fair investigation was not possible by state police.

In an earlier affidavit, CBI had said it had talked to rape survivors who alleged that some of the girls were killed by main accused Brajesh Thakur. The agency said it had excavated a bundle of bones from a location where a girl was apparently buried by the accused. ""The victims during there examination in the presence of experts of NIMHANS had revealed names of 11 girls who were allegedly murdered by Brajesh Thakur and his accomplices. These allegations are being duly investigated in the right earnest in the instant case by scrutinising the master register maintained at the Balikagrih to locate the bodies and through field level verification,"" the affidavit said.

HYDERABAD: Even as the National Population Register (NPR) is generating heat across the country, an NPR 'pretest' (trial form) was done in Telangana and the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh a few months ago. Senior officials said they did not receive any adverse feedback from the respondents.

Three districts each in both states were selected along with 68 districts across the country where the exercise was completed along with pretest for Census 2021 . According to highly-placed sources, the NPR prestesting was done in Nizamabad urban, Warangal urban and Mahbubnagar districts of Telangana and Vizianagaram, Anantapur and Guntur districts in AP.

Hyderabad MP and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and Muslim organisations have asked Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to stop all NPR activity in the state. Women members of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board on Monday appealed to KCR to pass a bill in assembly rejecting NPR and NRC .

Sources said nearly 30 lakh people have responded to the pretest form that was used to collect data in 74 districts in select states across the country. Details on 21 parameters, especially place of birth of father and mother, the last place of residence, along with Aadhaar (optional), PAN, voter ID card, passport, mobile phone and driving licence numbers, were sought from the respondents.

An official from Nizamabad district said the process had passed off smoothly. ""None of the respondents gave an adverse feedback. When this exercise was taken up in September and October 2019, there was no resistance from the citizens. All of them submitted their details voluntarily,"" he said.

Four wards in Nizamabad, seven villages of Veleru mandal in Warangal urban and four villages in Nawabpet mandal of Mahbubnagar were covered. A total of 144 enumerator blocs were identified with each having 120-150 houses. An official said families would be informed much in advance about the visit of an enumerator so that the documents of all individuals were readily available for verification.

In AP, eight villages in Anantapur's Atmakur mandal, eight villages in Vizianagaram's Bhogapruam mandal and six municipal wards in Guntur's Narsaraopet were covered. ""It is a myth that a lot of documents need to be shown by citizens when an enumerator arrives. Disclosing the details is also voluntary,"" the official explained.

Interestingly, this is not the first time that NPR has been undertaken in Telangana. In 2015, updation of NPR exercise of 2010 was taken up in all the districts. ""The NPR exercise conducted first in 2010 and subsequently updated in 2015 collected details on 15 parameters only,"" officials said.

The 15 parameters include name of person, relationship to head of household, father's name, mother's name, spouse's name (if married), sex, date of birth, marital status, place of birth, nationality (as declared), present address of usual residence, duration of stay at present address, permanent residential address, occupation/activity and educational qualification.

The present NPR has a database of 119 crore residents, an official revealed.

The fresh NPR data will be conducted from April-September 2020 along with the decennial Census exercise. While West Bengal and Kerala have issued orders that they would not allow NPR in their states, chief ministers of 11 other states have also declined to update NPR amid apprehensions that it will be followed by the National Register of Citizens .

""Over 52.72 lakh verified calls have been received so far in favour of CAA. The total calls are 68 lakh of which there are some repeats and some unverified,"" Shah told TOI while laying the foundation for a cycle walk project here.

NEW DELHI: In an aggressive retaliation against the opposition's allegations, BJP on Monday dubbed the violence on JNU campus as the handiwork of Leftists, with party functionaries circulating video clippings to bring out the latter's alleged culpability for the violence.

""There is a motley group of Left-leaning activists drawn from art, literature and Bollywood, lapsed academicians and failed politicians, who can't win a municipal poll but are ideological mercenaries. Backed by opposition parties, they are the ones fomenting trouble on campuses,"" head of BJP's social media unit Amit Malviya said.

Malviya released video clippings, one of which showed purported efforts to prevent registrations for the semester exams.

A group of 'masked men' are seen standing as a man instructs agroup of women to keep silent. 'Left Unity', a coalition of students' bodies aligned with Left, has called for boycott of semester tests as part of the campaign to revise fees.

""The masked revolution of JNU unmasked,"" Malviya tweeted. ""Remember, a few days ago, there were tutorials by Left on how to use masks to avoid facial recognition? AISA did this last time as well when they didn't let an ambulance reach a professor, who was critical. And today again. What makes the Left so barbaric and inhuman?"" he tweeted.

Condemning the incident, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said Congress, Left and AAP were inciting violence, specially on university campuses, which should be probed. Malviya re-tweeted several videos to prove his point. ""JNU students union president Aishee Ghosh is seen with masked men inside JNU,"" he said as he posted a video purportedly of Ghosh with masked men. Ghosh was hurt in the violence.

In another video shared by him, students purportedly belonging to ABVP are assaulted by a group for facilitating the registration process. ""Students associated with Left parties bashed up ABVP members when they were facilitating admission process. Students from Left parties wanted to cancel the admission process,"" he said.

Demonstrators shout slogans during a protest at Gateway of India in Mumbai against the attacks on the students... Read More

A tsunami of outrage against the hooliganism at JNU rose from some of the country's top campuses on Monday and swept through cities and towns, bringing thousands of others out onto the streets to create a chain of protest that seemingly stretched from the Gateway of India till the Gateway to the northeast.

Around midnight on Sunday, within a couple of hours of the violence in Delhi, a small group of Mumbai students had gathered at the Gateway of India with candles and posters expressing solidarity with JNU. By Monday evening, the gathering turned into a floating population of protesters taking turns to sing, chant and shout slogans against the rampage by masked goons on the JNU campus. The faces in the crowd included students from IIT-Bombay, Tata Institute of Social Sciences and Mumbai University.

Another protest organised by the Joint Action Committee for Social Justice, which had led the agitation against CAA and NRC, saw hundreds marching from Hutatma Chowk till the Gateway of India in the evening. Politicians such as Rohit Pawar, Abu Azmi, Kapil Patil, Sanjay Nirupam and Rais Shaikh joined the protest.

Neighbourhood restaurants showed their support by opening their restroom doors to the protesters. Some set up water fountains outside. One Instagram post asked people in the area to offer their homes as ""pee stops"".

Humming a Dylan song, one protester said, ""This has nothing to do with politics. It's about solidarity with students anywhere.""

Kolkata, the crucible of protest where no cause is too small to fight for, there was an hour-long face-off between 250-odd BJP supporters and 100-odd students of Jadavpur University agitating against the JNU assault . The police ensured the groups stayed put on opposite flanks, separated by barricades placed hundred metres apart. One group students marched to Esplanade and Raj Bhavan from College Square, shouting slogans against the attack on JNU students and teachers . other march by students and some teachers towards the state BJP headquarters was stopped midway.

In Chennai, students from IIT-Madras, Madras University and Presidency College joined teachers and activists in a candlelight vigil at Valluvar Kottam.

UP saw the most strident protests at Aligarh Muslim University, where students also took out a ""Tiranga March"" through the campus in solidarity with JNU.

The party also demanded a judicial inquiry into the attack.

MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray on Monday compared the attack on JNU students to the 26/11 Mumbai attack and demanded unmasking of the 'cowards' caught on camera brandishing rods. ""I watched reports of the violence inside JNU on TV and was instantly reminded of 26/11,"" the Shiv Sena chief said, assuring students protesting against the attack that he supported them and that they are safe in Maharashtra.

""They are cowards. Why cover your face if you were doing the right thing? Their masks should be taken off in public and their real faces exposed,"" he said while speaking to media at his Bandra residence.

He added that if Delhi Police does not act, there will be questions whether the attack was 'sponsored' and talk about police bias would be proved right. ""I do not want to make any political comments regarding who is responsible, it will all be clear in a few days,"" said the Sena chief who broke ties with BJP recently.

""It's a blot on government if students do not feel safe in hostels and colleges... I want to assure the youth of Maharashtra I won't let anything happen to them. There will be serious repercussions if anyone tries to repeat in Maharashtra what happened on JNU campus,''he said. ""There is a feeling of restlessness amongst the youth of the country and we should all come together to dispel these fears,"" Thackeray added.

NEW DELHI: Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula committed suicide after he was suspended from Hyderabad Central University in 2016. A complaint was filed by ABVP and a Union minister from BJP that he had indulged in ""anti-national"" activities.

Fast forward to the complaint by ABVP that ""anti-India"" sloganeering took place in JNU during an event in 2016, which turned out to be the breakout moment for young leader Kanhaiyya Kumar .

Protest against JNU campus violence live updates.

A similar story followed at a seminar in Delhi University. And now, on Sunday evening, masked armed men barging into JNU campus right under the nose of police and running riot, targeting students and faculty members in hostels and residences.

Over last four years, University campuses have become the front-line of ideological battles - the line-up being the ""Hindutva"" proponents versus Left-liberal outfits and the saffron trope being that campuses shelter ""anti-national"" acts. The face-off is a post-2014 phenomenon, with the BJP-RSS, riding on hard nationalism, appearing to have decided to extend their triumph in Parliament and assemblies to the islands of liberal thought like JNU.

In India, the campus faceoffs are not new, a reason why every political party has ensured it has a youth outfit to carry its flag among students. But what is novel is the overwhelming surge of BJP-backed outfit, on a formulaic pattern of targeting the Left and Congress-affiliated students for ""anti-nationalism"". It forced Congress and Left to come out in support of students, like Rahul's visit to JNU.

As the saffron offensive, clubbing liberals and Muslims to paint them as a nexus, appeared successful over four years, Congress erupted in rethink that the party should be circumspect in lending its support to the varsity youth.

The saffron camp appeared to be on a rampage. Till Parliament on December 11, 2019, passed the Citizenship Amendment Bill , overcoming the vociferous dissent from the Congress-led opposition.

Before BJP could celebrate, university students across states erupted in protests, calling the citizenship law the anti-thesis of the Constitution.

This was a bolt from the blue - mainstream youth, largely from majority community, said to be the catchment demographic of BJP, waving tricolour, swearing by the Constitution and appearing implacable. Jamia Millia Islamia and AMU too broke free, but the ruling camp appeared unsettled as it seemed impossible to caricature young students.

New Year serves as the perfect opportunity to try out things that have been on our wish list for long. No wonder, this is the month when thousands of health, fitness and nature enthusiasts across the globe sign up for Veganuary — a month-long vegan pledge — in their endeavour to shift towards a plant-based diet as a way of protecting the environment, preventing animal suffering and improving the health of millions of people. Adding more cheer to vegan lovers this January was the news that the 77th Golden Globe Awards went for an entirely plant-based menu this time, garnering compliments from many, including Leonardo DiCaprio.Closer home, restaurateurs and café owners in Kolkata — a city known for its eternal love forand— are modifying their menus to cater to the growing demand for vegan food. So, after warming up to microbreweries, health cafes etc, the City of Joy is now embracing veganism , slowly but surely. With the vegan movement finally here, the food, fitness and lifestyle industry can’t keep calm. Cashing in on the latest buzz is a host of eateries that are now serving vegan dishes. While the latest docu on the subject has spread the word of its wonders like wildfire, celeb role models and increasing access to vegan options in supermarkets, online stores and food joints alike have contributed to a sudden spurt in vegans in this part of the world.Chef Urvika Kanoi from The Daily feels vegan is not just a trend but an actual diet that people follow in all seriousness. “I think it is here to stay and will only grow because a lot of people are giving up animal products completely. The number of people turning vegan in this city is definitely on the rise,” she says. However, she feels that Kolkata still lacks an adequate supply of resources required to sustain this lifestyle. “You have the option of getting certain products online or from the supermarkets, but not a lot of restaurants are serving vegan food. Hence, we wanted to bring in vegan and support different diets, including keto-friendly food, gluten-free options et al,” adds Urvika.Lorenzo Gomes and Samantha Roxanne Pereira, head chefs at Sienna Café, also believe that the vegan concept is going to become an integral part of the city’s foodscape. The common man’s concern for the environment is now bigger than ever before and the duo feel changing our diet and lifestyle can directly contribute to the welfare of our planet as well our body. “The vegan lifestyle promotes good health and helps preserve the environment — all of which are part of our café’s ethos. So, we’ve incorporated vegan options in our menu to provide healthy, cruelty-free dishes. Seeing how the world is changing, we will all be compelled to become more mindful of what we eat and where it’s coming from. It’s a pleasant change to see more and more Kolkatans becoming conscious about their health and the environment. This trend is only going to get more popular,” they affirm.If you thought being a vegan limits your food choices, you’ll be in for a delightful surprise for there’s a whole world of plant-based food options that are ready to be served and devoured. From ice creams, cheesecakes to smoothies, fabcafe’s menu boasts of many dairy- and meat-free dishes. “Every day, we make fresh almond milk, which can be used in coffee, tea, smoothie or anything. So, any recipe that is made with regular milk can be customised here using almond milk. We have quite a lot of vegan options on the menu and if a specific dish is not there, we can get it made using a vegan preparation,” says Rebekah Blank, the café’s brand head.They have specific icons on the menu to indicate vegan dishes or ones that can be customised for vegan diners. The main course features several items using cashew cream or coconut milk. “Besides, we have two vegan desserts — one is a coconut milk-based ice cream and the other is a cashew almond-based ice cream. Both are really lovely, even for non-vegans. Usually, pure vegans don’t have access to ice cream. And for our cheesecake, we make cheese out of fresh cashew. We also have a fresh fruit payasam, which is coconut-based,” she explains.Besides cafes and restaurants, a number of home bakers and cloud kitchens too have begun to take vegan orders. From nut milks packed in glass bottles to cakes without the usual doses of butter and milk, the city abounds with takers for such healthier alternatives.After a bit of research, Drishleen Sethi and Anshul Kumar, co-owners of SAZ - American Brasserie, found out that most of their clientele in the 25-40 age bracket are either following or inclined to follow veganism, and will eventually make it a part of their lifestyle. “Vegetarians too are gradually adopting the same food habits. So, we decided to introduce a few vegan dishes to cater to this niche within the niche, without compromising on the taste and flavours,” says Drishleen.Most of the health conscious customers at Sienna are also aged between 30 and late 40s. However, interestingly, Urvika had initially not anticipated people above a certain age going vegan. “But we’ve been getting a great response from even those above 45-50, who are now planning to turn vegan,” she shares.The appeal of these special eateries is not confined to strict vegans alone. It extends to those who are out to sample vegan dishes as a culinary experiment or even those who are considering making the leap of faith. “Yes, we do get a lot of diners who are not really vegans per se, but are excited to try the dishes out just because veganism has been making such waves across the globe and is said to have amazing health benefits too. What is still lacking though is the correct understanding of what’s what. People still can’t tell a vegetarian from a vegan. That’s something we are trying to address. But no harm in taking baby steps, right?” asks Saloni Jhunjhunwalla, owner/partner at The Salt House Kolkata, where one has the option to customise certain dishes as per vegan guidelines.Agrees Urvika, who feels a lot of people do not understand the difference between vegetarian and vegan. “So, many customers end up asking for vegan when they are just looking for vegetarian. Vegan is an absolute shun of animal products — no dairy, no honey, nothing,” she says.According to Saloni, a big reason this movement is gaining momentum in the West is that it's driven by animal rights issues. “That’s not the scenario in India. Also, dairy products like milk and ghee are too integral a part of our day-to-day life as well as cultural symbols. So many of our religious practices are incomplete without milk and ghee. Going a 100% vegan is too much of a departure from that,” says Saloni, who believes vegan is so far more of a buzz word here than an actual practice that people have taken on holistically. ""They'll go vegan while dieting, or because they're suffering from a certain ailment. Unlike a Delhi or Mumbai, I don't think it's a trend that can drive or sustain F&B business in this city yet,” she points out.However, she says when diners try out vegan preparations, more often than not, they like it. “I’ve observed more keenness among women. The awareness that it helps lead a more active lifestyle, makes their fondness go a notch up,” she adds with a wink.The ongoing vegan movement will soon see the death of fast food chains in the country is what Chef Varun Mohan of Royal Vega, ITC Royal Bengal, hopes. He feels Indian food was never marketed so well before the vegan trend set off. “vegetarian. The Indian vegetarian cuisine is a hidden treasure trove that is only being discovered by the world now. It was always there in our kitchens, but unlike the Italians or the Chinese, we didn’t do much to make the world go gaga over it. In fact, we started following western food trends and gave in to pizzas and burgers. But seeing the popularity of this movement, I hope fast food chains will become a thing of the past in the next 5-8 years,” says the chef, who is happy to customise most of his menu items for those with vegan restrictions. “The raita can be replaced with soy milk curd. Instead of paneer, we’ll serve you edamame or okra. So on and so forth,” adds Varun.Intolerance towards lactose, climate change concerns, increasing awareness about the harsh realities of the dairy and meat industries, protection of animal rights, keenness to try out new health trends and following celebrities are some of the most common reasons for taking to veganism. “Dairy-free items are a hit with those intolerant to lactose. Besides, most dairy items these days have foreign substances like hormones added to them. So by opting to go vegan, you’re also avoiding things like pesticides that you may be consuming through dairy products,” says Rebekah.According to Urvika, people are now becoming aware of the unethical treatment meted out to animals through gruesome online videos. “They also know about the realities of the dairy and meat industries. The awareness about the benefits of turning vegan is going up. And of course, a lot of us do try to follow celebrities as well,” she says.Varun, who has observed an increased interest in vegetarianism in the last eight years, says, “Prioritising health is the primary reason behind people making the switch. Animal rights issue is also there but that comes much later in this part of the world.”A common deterrent for people who wish to go the vegan way is the notion that it’s a lavish lifestyle. However, Urvika believes there is no reason why vegan food should be costlier. “Everybody loves eating out, so having access to food suiting all kinds of diets is very important. If following a certain diet costs a bomb then it will dissuade people from choosing it. That’s not right. At our café, the prices for vegan are on a par with other dishes,” she says.Lorenzo and Samantha say while vegan appetizers and entrees at their café are not priced higher, the desserts are slightly more expensive as vegan substitutes for chocolate, flour etc cost considerably more than the regular processed ingredients. “We’ve started working with organic, vegan chocolates and baking ingredients. When your food comes super cheap and quickly, it’s probably made using low-quality ingredients and in an unsustainable way. So, it’s worth paying more when the choice is healthier and planet-friendly,” they opine.Drishleen tells us that prices depend on the rarity of vegetables and products they buy. “Our vegan options are not really expensive in comparison, but it all depends on the ingredients. For instance, sweet potato or squash or kale is extremely healthy but not easily available in the city. Hence, a dish with such ingredients can get a bit costlier. Pricing also depends on where you shop from. A vegetable vendor on the streets will obviously be much cheaper than a top-notch grocery store that ensures quality,” she elaborates.Vegetarians across the globe are rejoicing the popularity of veganism. Besides its positive impact on climate and wildlife, it has also thrown open a host of choices for vegetarians who earlier had difficulties in finding suitable meals for their palate while travelling abroad. Agrees Tanvi Jain, whose recent European honeymoon left her spoilt for choice. “Generally, food is the last area to explore for vegetarians on foreign trips. But thanks to the vegan movement sweeping the world, we Indian vegetarians are getting an opportunity to taste global flavours without comprising on our diet pattern. During our honeymoon, not even for a moment did we miss Indian food. In fact, we had our first brush with herbed food, which we now try and replicate in our own kitchen. We’ve also begun to accept soy milk as a tastier and healthier alternative to buffalo milk,” says the 28-year-old. “My husband and I indulged in many vegan delicacies. An app that categorises restaurants as vegan, vegetarian and non-vegetarian that serves vegetarian came in handy,” adds Tanvi, who has always practiced vegetarianism and Jain-vegetarianism. “But our experience, coupled with the recent documentary, has inspired us to consider veganism,” she adds.So, while we are still enjoying our stay on planet Earth, would you consider making alterations to your diet to ensure a safer environment for future generations or would you rather dismiss it as one of those fads? Here’s leaving you with some food for thought.While the vegan lifestyle in its true sense is not very popular in Kolkata, many are willing to initiate a vegan diet. More and more people are getting rid of dairy products. So, that’s a start. Though it does become difficult to find alternatives in a city which is known for its non-vegetarian food, products like nut milk, nutritional yeast, chia seeds and spirulina can be easily incorporated in a vegan’s diet. Kolkata now has a lot of restaurants coming up with vegan options. It is a step towards a better lifestyle. Many cafes are letting customers opt for soy or almond milk. Recently, a fully vegan catering service started in the city. Even vegan dog food is now available at select pet stores. I would like to call it the onset of the vegan trend in Kolkata. However, this practice is much more prevalent abroad.The trend surely has a lot of potential here. However, its sustenance depends on better accessibility of vegan products. A common perception of dairy being our body’s best friend is finally breaking down. Now, people are willing to adopt changes in their lifestyle and are more open to trying out new alternatives. They are reaching out to nutritionists to understand what best suits their bodies. Unlike the West, where most people are inclined towards veganism for ethical reasons, here it is the health perspective that is leading to a change in mindsets. An increasing number of the population wants to be a part of the trend and experiment with their diets.An elimination of animal products from one’s diet will lead torelying more on other whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, peas, beans, nuts and seeds. Animal food products carry large amounts of toxins, antibiotics and artificial hormones, which are directly linked to life-threatening diseases including cancer. Similarly, due to the injection of antibiotics in cows, our bodies are becoming antibiotic resistant. This also indicates that medically prescribed antibiotics will now stop having an impact on our bodies, making us prone to diseases. On switching to only plant-based foods, the body is being protected from the extra hormones and wastes that come from animal products such as non-organic milk, farm-processed eggs and meat. While it may seem like a struggle in the early stages, being a vegan can help fight a number of diseases, leading to a healthier life in future.A large number of people are now joining the Vegan India Movement with their motto being ‘eat clean and go green’. Internationally, veganism is an established lifestyle with great food alternatives. Veganism being fairly new to India, especially Kolkata, there is a lack of substitutes required to maintain a proper vegan diet. The substitutes are either expensive or not easily available. The situation is better in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore.However, if you have balanced and planned meals, veganism can make you happier and healthier without any discomfort. But you can’t turn into a vegan overnight. A lot of trial and error as well as research go into it. If you have certain deficiencies or ailments that make itessential for you to consume certain foods, then switching to veganism can be tough. You should have complete knowledge of your body and get regular guidance to prepare it for the transformation.For those who think turning vegan can help them with their weight-loss programme, let me burst the bubble. Though veganism has tremendous health benefits, it may or may not help you lose those extra kilos. However, it certainly helps in reducing theprevalence of type 2 diabetes, obesity and heart problems.Since vegan diets are plant-based, the amount of water, fibre, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants in your body will be much higher compared to non-vegetarians, whose diets are extremely high on fats and low on vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.Vegetarianism and veganism have similar health benefits and can help in all stages of life if meals are balanced properly. Both would definitely require extra supplementation of vitamin B12 and vitamin D3. However, vegans are at a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart diseases and certain types of cancers.I am still in the transition phase. Turning vegan is not an overnight process, especially if you’ve been a hard-core non-vegetarian all your life. The idea struck me after my body started reacting funnily to meat and milk products. Despite giving up dairy items, I continued to face major bloating issues. After some research, I learnt that meat and diary contain substances that cause inflammation, especially in the gut. Though I’ve given up meat, I do sometimes end up having eggs. The challenge was to unlearn habits that I have developed over the years. Eggs and sausages for breakfast, mutton on weekends and an elaborate non-veg spread when eating out. Giving up milk was easy since I’ve always been lactose intolerant but I’d still eat cheese. So, it’s difficult on days I feel like ordering in, like when I want to eat a pizza. Kolkata still doesn’t do vegan pizza! The options are few. However, five years back, it’d have been almost impossible to turn vegan in this city. But today you have almost everything. Apart from online, there are a couple of brick and mortar stores here that have a variety of vegan options on offer — from plant-based cheese and milk to mock meat. As long as you’re eating at home, it’s not an expensive affair.My vegan journey started post my first fast in 2008. For me, it wasn’t much of a challenge as I was always a vegetarian and never used milk in my tea or coffee. However, initially, my friends and family would not encourage me. Their perception began to change only when they started to see some really positive changes in my health and fitness levels. Now the same people come forward to ask me about the dos and don’ts.I think Kolkata still needs to go a long way to accommodate vegans. The options are few are far between. The choices at cafes and restaurants are so limited that I prefer to carry my own meal when stepping out.It might seem like an expensive and tedious affair at first. But when you actually factor in the medical expenses that come along with unhealthy eating practices, it all begins to seem worth the money and effort.I think we in India still turn to veganism out of specific health/dietary compulsions and not purely out of choice. Whereas, people across Europe, America and South East Asia are voluntarily going for plant-based foods. Tel Aviv in Israel, for instance, is the vegan capital of the world.About one and a half years ago, I was having a lot of health issues. I’d feel bloated, lethargic and generally unwell. But after visiting the doctors, I realised there wasn’t really anything wrong. It was mostly because of all the dairy products I was consuming. I started researching about it and got in touch with a nutritionist. She made me aware about the harmful effects of milk these days. I got to know about how cows are treated and the chemicals that are injected to the milk. Though I was a vegetarian anyway, I decided to cut out all dairy products. I don’t have my health issues anymore and have started to feel much lighter. I have switched to almond milk. I’m also big on the environmental issues and I realised how non-vegetarianism is affecting us. These were my two reasons.Yes, it’s an expensive affair. A carton of regular milk will cost me 60-70 bucks whereas almond milk will be `300-400 as it’s mostly imported. You have to keep hunting for ingredients, keep your meals prepared in advance. It is a bit challenging for sure but it’s doable and totally worth the task. If not for the environment, do it for your own self. You will never regret turning to veganism.It’s been two years since I turned vegan. Earlier, I’d turn veg for the month of Saawan every year. Then this one time I tried following a vegan diet. The positive effect it had on my lifestyle tempted me to research more. The environmental aspect of it sealed the deal for me and I haven’t looked back ever since. Only a person who has tried vegan can experience the wonders it does to the body. Initially, I did wonder how it’d be to survive in a Bengali household with meat and dairy going out. But as Indians, it is easier for us to practise veganism as we have a variety of ingredients in our kitchens.Yes, I can’t suddenly reach out to a packet of biscuits and coffee if I’m hungry. I need to make sure I have my supply of almond milk. I make my own milk. It might be slightly more expensive, but if you compare it with the amount of money you spend on having steaks outside, it is a much more affordable.A lot of people who wrote me off initially, saying I am going to lose muscle mass, I won’t be able to lift weights, are now inspired by me. After watching the latest docu on veganism and with my progress as an example, many hardcore non-vegetarians are now trying veg meals on certain days. Kolkata definitely has more options for vegans now, but it is still far from great.According to the oldest vegan organisation in the world, The Vegan Society, which was founded in the UK in 1944 by Donald Watson, Elsie “Sally” Shrigley and 23 others, veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude — as far as is possible and practicable — all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms, it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals. The founding of The Vegan Society is celebrated annually on November 1, which is known as World Vegan Day.Remove meat or dairy one day a week. Or you could try changing one meal at a time. You could even try changing one product at a time by swapping cow’s milk for almond or soya milk or butter for coconut oil or margarine. There’s a plant-based alternative for almost every type of food.There are vegan versions of almost every type of junk food. So, eat a wide variety of tasty plant foods to ensure you don’t miss out on essential nutrients.There are thousands of vegan recipes out there from every corner of the globe. You’ll be pleasantly surprised by the number of meals you can easily prepare from things already in your kitchen or local supermarket ingredients.Going vegan is a learning curve. To live as a vegan in a non-vegan world takes both courage and curiosity. So, allow yourself time to learn about the various strands of veganism.“Where can I buy vegan chocolate?”, “How do I bake cakes without eggs?”, “I don’t know how to speak to my family about veganism!” You’re not alone. There’s nothing like talking to other vegans to make your transition even easier.Keep reminding yourself of the reasons you’ve chosen a vegan lifestyle, and the benefits you’ve felt since going vegan. You’ll probably find going vegan a lot easier than expected. Reading books or watching videos about veganism helps, as does keeping motivating visual reminders of your favourite animals.If you believe in yourself, vegan living will soon become second nature. There is always a better reason to stick with your decision than to go against it. Take it one day at a time.Shraddha Kapoor calls herself a “smart eater”“Healthy vegan meals” is the secret behind Esha Gupta’s energy and glow since 2015Ayesha Takia Azmi, along with her mother andsister, has been a long-time vegan.

A city street enveloped in fog

KOLKATA: The city got colder on Monday with the minimum temperature dipping below the normal mark on the Celsius scale. With the cloud cover clearing up, Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 12.6°C, a degree below normal. On Sunday, it had been 14.8°C. The Met office now expects the mercury to recede further. However, another spell of rain, expected on Thursday, could push up the temperature again. At 22.6°C, the maximum temperature on Monday was three notches below normal during the day.

“We can expect the minimum temperature to go down a little more by Tuesday and stay between 11°C and 12°C,” said G K Das, director ( weather ) at RMC, Kolkata.

However, a western disturbance is likely to prevent the mercury from falling further and the city is expected to get some light rain on January 9. The moisture incursion in the run-up to the rain might push the mercury up to 14°C by Thursday.

“A patch of western disturbance will reach Jharkhand and western districts of Bengal by Wednesday, and Kolkata the next day. This could bring light rain in Kolkata and push up the mercury from Thursday, making the night warmer,” added Das.

Representative image

PATNA: The state education department has ordered the district magistrates to ensure that all government schools remain open on January 19 (Sunday) so that the students could participate in the human chain to be formed across the state that day to create awareness about climate change , prohibition and social evils of dowry and child marriage. However, attendance of students in the school and their participation in the event is not mandatory, the order said.

State education department additional chief secretary RK Mahajan on Monday issued a letter to all the district magistrates in this regard. Mahajan, in the letter, stated that all primary, middle, secondary and higher secondary schools will remain open on January 19. Leave of all teachers as well as employees of education department have also been cancelled that day. Instead, they will be given compensatory off some other day.

Mahajan told TOI on Monday that it will be optional for the children to come to school on January 19 as no attendance will be taken. But for teachers, their attendance will be compulsory. “We are not forcing kids to come to the school that day. We are opening all the schools that day, so that those students willingly to participate in the human chain could get a place to assemble,” Mahajan clarified.

Mahajan’s letter stated that students from class 1 to IV can form the human chain inside the school premises and those above class IV can form the human chain either on the main routes or the sub-routes, but close to their schools.

All the teachers, as well as the students, have been asked to be present in the school by 9am in the school and finish their midday meal by 10:30am, so that they could mark their presence in the chain formation scheduled between 11:30am and 12 noon.

The human chain, which has been targeted to be at least 16,200km-long, is aimed at creating awareness regarding chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Jal-Jivan-Hariyali campaign along with garnering support in favour of liquor prohibition as well as against dowry and child marriage.

48,['7/01/2020'],Bihar: Cases of cybercrime up 5.5 times in seven years,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: Incidents of cybercrime increased 5.5 times in the state in 2019 compared to 2012. The official data compiled by the state economic offences unit (EOU) revealed that altogether 280 cases of cybercrime were transferred to the cyber cell at the police headquarters for technical assistance in 2019 compared to only 51 cases in 2012.

The figures also revealed that there were around 7 crore cellphone users in the state. Of them, 4 crore people were using smartphones. The state has a population of around 14 crore.

Recently, a cyber fraudster duped a woman of Hajipur in Vaishali district of Rs70,000 and transferred a big amount into the relief funds of the chief ministers of Assam, Kerala and Meghalaya. A case was lodged against unidentified persons with the Hajipur Town police station.

The unprecedented rise in the cases of cybercrime forced the top police officers to impart training to the police personnel on field assignments.

“The incidents of cybercrime have rapidly increased in the state in the last few years. So, the knowledge of computer and technology is necessary for police personnel to deal with cases related to cybercrime,” ADG (EOU) J S Gangwar said at a five-day training session for policemen on cybercrime on Monday.

Gangwar said the police headquarters has already launched a training programme for the police personnel and till date 249 SHOs, 28 women SHOs and 75 public prosecutors have been imparted training to deal with cybercrime cases. Altogether 700 police personnel and 40 women cops in batches were to be provided training on investigation of the cases related to cyber fraud.

The police headquarters has proposed training of 2,200 judicial officers, public prosecutors and police personnel of the state on cyber fraud and awareness under the Centre’s Cyber Crime Prevention for Women and Children Scheme (CCPWCS). In all 25,000 police personnel, 13,000 judicial officers and 2,500 women police personnel are to be trained under the scheme of the central government, the ADG said.

On Monday, a team of 40 SHOs and four women SHOs was inducted for training on cybercrime. Ashok Bandopadhyay, associate director of CDAC, which has been inducted for training, talked about the three types of cybercrime related to finance (bank and ATM fraud etc), atrocities on women (objectionable message, obscene pictures etc) and terror (hatred and revenge).

DG (BMP) S K Singhal stressed on the need for mental and physical fitness of the police personnel for doing justice to their job. SP (EOU) P K Das also expressed his view on the occasion.

PATNA: Poll strategist and JD(U) national vice-president Prashant Kishor and former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar from Bihar have been included in the Forbes India’s prestigious list of ‘20 people to watch in the 2020s’.

While including the names of Kishor (42) and Kanhaiya (32) in the list of world’s 20 top future powerful people, the Forbes India magazine has said, “They could be the defining faces of the decade.”

While Kishor belongs to Sasaram in Rohtas district, Kanhaiya is born and brought up in Begusarai district.

Besides Prashant and Kanhaiya, other prominent Indians in the list are Dushyant Chautala (deputy CM of Haryana), Mahua Moitra (Lok Sabha member of TMC), the Godrej family (of Adi Godrej) and Garima Arora (chef and the first Indian woman to receive a Michelin star). The other prominent persons of Indian origin in the list are US-born Hasan Minhaj (comedian, political commentator) and Aditya Mittal (Group CFO and CEO, ArcelorMittal Europe).

“Prashant Kishor has been a political strategist since 2011 when he helped the BJP win the Gujarat state elections. This was followed by his 2014 campaign for the BJP under his political strategy firm Citizen for Accountable Governance (CAG) which helped it win the Lok Sabha elections. The CAG was renamed as I-PAC (Indian Political Action Committee) and Kishor now serves as mentor to the organization,” the magazine says.

“Kanhaiya Kumar went on to become the face of student politics at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) after he was slapped with sedition charges in 2016.

PATNA: Sunday’s mob attack at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi has sparked an outrage in Patna with different student organizations staging protests against the violence.

A mob had allegedly barged into JNU on Sunday evening and attacked students and teachers with sticks and rods.

Representatives of the Jan Adhikar Chhatra Parishad sat on a dharna in front of the Wheeler Senate House of Patna University (PU) on Monday and shouted anti-BJP, RSS and ABVP slogans. They were opposing the present government’s alleged repressive measures against JNU students, who had been agitating peacefully against the recent fee hike.

Incidentally, the newly-elected Patna University Students’ Union is also headed by Jan Adhikar Chhatra Parishad leader, Manish Yadav.

Another bunch of students, owing allegiance to the All India Students’ Association, also sat on a dharna at the same spot. Carrying placards, they raised slogans against the NDA government and demanded strict action against the “anti-social elements”, who had attacked innocent students and teachers. They also sought removal of JNU’s vice-chancellor, Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar.

PU registrar Manoj Kumar Mishra told this newspaper, “The agitating students protested peacefully and did not damage any property of the university. However, police remained vigilant.”

Sweety Kumari has been selected as rugby’s ‘International Young Player of the Year 2019’

PATNA: Barh girl Sweety Kumari has been selected as rugby’s ‘International Young Player of the Year 2019’. She was shortlisted for the award by reputed women’s rugby website ‘Scrumqueens’. She was selected among the top ten players from across the world through public voting in December.

The 19-year-old Sweety hails from Nawada village in Barh tehsil of Patna district. She plays as a winger in the senior national team and is nicknamed as India’s ‘Scoring Machine’ by teammates.

Elated over her feat, Sweety told this newspaper on that she feels proud and happy that she would get the award at a big platform. “Bihar Rugby Football Association’s (BRFA) secretary Pankaj Kumar Jyoti told me about the award. It came as a New Year surprise for me. This award will surely boost my morale to further improve my skills,” she said.

Scrumqueens wrote on its official website: “She impressed from the start but it was this year that she started making a big impact in Asia at both sevens and fifteens. Described by Asia Rugby as the continent’s fastest player, her explosive pace and power has resulted in her top scoring at most of India’s sevens tournaments, as well as scoring two outstanding tries in their first ever Test match win against Singapore.”

The girl had been given the ‘Best Player Award 2018’ by the Asia Rugby Regional Association of World Rugby and ‘Best Scorer Award’ by the Bhubaneswar Rugby Football Association last year.

Sweety aims to represent India in World Women’s Rugby Championship, Olympics and Asian Games. She was the part of the Indian team which won silver in Asia Rugby XVII Championship held at Jakarta in October 2019. “Had we won the tournament at Jakarta, our team would have represented India in Olympics. Now, I’ll try harder and practice day and night to achieve my goal,”said Sweety, who is currently pursuing psychology (Honours) from ANS College at Barh.

Born to bank agent Dilip Kumar Choudhary and Anganwadi sewika Pushpa Singh, Sweety completed her Intermediate and matriculation from SS Girl’s High School. “When I was in class IX, I was in state athletics team. Although I was good in running but not a good athlete. During the sports camp, I met BRFA secretary Pankaj sir. He encouraged me to join rugby in 2017 after he watched my skills on tracks. I had no knowledge about the game but with his guidance I learned a lot,” she recalled.

“Though many people criticised the girls who joined rugby, my parents always supported me,” said Sweety. When asked how she got inclined towards sports, she replied: “I never missed any opportunity to take part in school annual sports meet. I always did well in all sporting events. That’s how I developed interest in sports. Rugby is my passion, but I always find time for studies and want to complete my graduation,” she said.

Sweety’s parents also expressed happiness over her achievements at such a short span of time. They give credit to BRFA for recognizing their daughter’s talent and believing in her skills.

K C Tyagi

PATNA: Ruling JD(U) and LJP as well as opposition RJD, Congress and other parties on Monday condemned the violent attack on students and faculty members at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi on Sunday.

JD(U) has demanded a free and fair inquiry into the incident by a Supreme Court judge. It has also demanded immediate removal of the JNU vice-chancellor and other top administrative officials from their respective posts to ensure a fair probe into the case.

JD(U) national secretary general and spokesperson K C Tyagi said in a statement issued on Monday that all sections of society should strongly criticize the way elected office-bearers of the JNU Students’ Union were attacked by masked ‘goons’. “We strongly condemn the attitude of the university’s vice-chancellor and other authorities who turned a silent spectator to the dirty game of these goons. Police officials also failed in performing their duties,” Tyagi said.

“The JD(U) demands a free and fair inquiry by a Supreme Court judge and removal of the VC and other top administrators from their respective posts to ensure a fair trial,” he added.

LJP president Chirag Paswan also condemned the violent attacks on JNU students and teachers and asked the political parties not to make universities their “political arena”. “I am deeply perturbed by the violence in JNU. The basic responsibility of JNU administration is to ensure the safety of students. Parents must be concerned about the safety of their children by looking at such scenes. Such incidents with students is highly condemnable,” Chirag tweeted on Monday.

RJD national vice-president and former Bihar CM Rabri Devi said if strict action is not taken against such unruly elements, people would lose their trust in government and universities. “The attack by masked goons in JNU is highly condemnable. People will lose their trust in government and universities and such criminal-minded people will get provoked, if strict action is not taken against such elements. It would also make parents and guardians concerned about their wards. I would urge the Centre and Delhi government to conduct a thorough inquiry into the incident and give strict punishment to the accused persons. It should also be ensured that such incidents is not repeated in future,” Rabri said in a statement.

Congress’s Bihar unit blamed right-wing students’ outfit for the JNU violence . “The trend started by BJP to silence dissent through violence is not at all a healthy practice in democracy. JNU always had this culture of having debates and voices of varied opinions, but violence was never allowed on the campus. BJP will have to ensure peace and safety of students at JNU and other institutions of higher education along with providing employment opportunities,” former JNU Students’ Union president and Kadwa MLA Shakil Ahmad Khan said.

Another former JNUSU president, Kanhaiya Kumar, also blamed the central government for the JNU violence. “They have waged a war against students since coming to power … However, I would iterate that the more they will try to suppress, the more students of India will rise and fail their anti-Constitution and anti-poor policies,” Kanhaiya tweeted.

PANAJI: CBI on Monday conducted searches at 12 locations across the state in connection with the Rs 5.4 crore foreign cigarettes smuggling ring.

55,['7/01/2020'],HC quashes NDTV promoters’ plea,"This story is from January 7, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday dismissed a petition filed by NDTV promoters Prannoy Roy and his wife Radhika that challenged a show-cause notice issued to them in August 2018 by Sebi .

The markets regulator had issued the notice for an alleged decade-old violation of insider trading rules as promoters of the television channel.

The Roys had challenged the validity of the August 2018 notice issued 10 years after the alleged trading activity in violation of Sebi (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 in relation with NDTV scrips. Their counsel Fereshte Sethna argued that Sebi had not granted it inspection of several documents it was referring to and relying on.

After hearing her and Sebi counsel J J Bhatt, a bench of Justices S C Dharmadhikari and Riyaz Chagla dismissed the petition by the Roys, holding there to be “no need for interference” in the show-cause. An adjudicating authority of Sebi — S K Mohanty, as whole-time member — will now hear and decide the issue raised by the show-cause notice. Once passed, his order can be challenged before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT).

After dictating its order, when Sethna persisted that inspection of documents at least be allowed, the HC observed that if the administrative adjudicatory panel makes an error, the Roys can always point it out later. The Roys said that the Sebi notice “constitutes a gross abuse of process” and that the allegations levelled by the regulator “are baseless and unfounded”. Their case is that there is “no shred of evidence” with Sebi nor have they been furnished any documents to substantiate the allegations.

The Roys said that the Sebi notice relates to proposed restructuring of NDTV into ‘news-related businesses’ and investments in ‘beyond news’ businesses held through NDTV Network Plc, during the year 2008 — a proposal that was eventually not implemented.

The Sebi issued the notice saying that they traded in the shares of NDTV while in possession of ‘unpublished price-sensitive information’ pertaining to such proposed restructuring, and that such alleged wrongful gain is liable to disgorgement. The case of Sebi is that whatever documentation was required was shown.

The Roys’ plea is that “in their capacity as promoters” they had “sought and secured pre-trade clearances in terms of code of conduct for prohibition of insider trading adopted”, including Sebi and stock exchanges being notified by the channel.

Their petition says that since the Sebi notice is issued after a lapse of 10 years from the alleged transactions, the relevant records are no longer available with them and hence the notice would “irretrievably prejudice and jeopardise the right to defend themselves”.

The Roys have pointed to a Delhi HC interim order of last year that had granted them inspection of documents in another show-cause notice issued by Sebi over a loan transaction. Sethna had argued that by directing Sebi to permit an inspection there, the Delhi HC had recognised the need for such inspection to be mandatory. The Bombay HC was not persuaded by these arguments and dismissed their petition.

SURAT: Police are yet to take action against Mahesh Savani, a top realtor who also holds mass marriages for orphan girls, for allegedly kidnapping a builder to recover Rs19 crore from him here on Saturday. Savani had lent Rs3 crore to victim Gautam Patel, 65 , in 2009-10 but was demanding Rs19 crore now , the complainant has alleged in FIR.

Borewells leave little water for cultivation for them, allege farmers

Surat: State government has asked industrial houses of Kadodara, Plasana , Tatithaiya , Chalthan and Bagumara who have built and installed systems to draw water illegally from underground sources to destroy them within nine days or face action. Roads and buildings department of Gujarat government has issued a public warning in newspapers asking the units to stop their illegal activities immediately. “Action will be initiated against those who don’t stop their illegal activities immediately. We will stop this practice of stealing of underground water in the state,” said an officer of the department.

Groundwater depletion in these areas has mainly happened because of theft of water, farmers allege. Kadodara, Plasana, Tatithaiya, Chalthan and Bagumara in Surat district together have at least 500 industrial units. Water requirement remains high in these units because majority of them are into textile manufacturing.

About 200 farmers of these villages had jointly written to the concerned district authorities complaining that nearly 50 dyeing mills located in their areas had set up illegal facilities to draw water from underground sources. These units have built borewells and stepwells to draw water from underground sources and this has left little water for cultivation, they complained.

Darshan Nayak, member of Surat District Panchayat, told TOI, “A few years ago, water was available if one dug up 200 feet deep. However, groundwater overexploitation has resulted in water level going down to 400 feet. We need to take action against people who are carrying out illegal activities.”

A farmer on condition of anonymity said, “Water mafias connected to owners of industries have also set up facilities to draw water and sell it to people and units.”

Mumbai: HDFC Bank said its deposits and advances had grown 25% and 20% respectively as of December 2019 over the previous year. The country’s largest private bank said its advances as at the end of Q3 stood at Rs 9.34 lakh crore — up 20% from Rs 7.81 lakh crore in December 2018, in a statement. At the end of September 2019, the bank’s advances were at Rs 8.97 lakh crore.

As against this, the banking sector’s advances stood at Rs 99.47 lakh crore as on December 20, 2019 — up 7.1% over last year. RBI’s sectoral credit data, which is available up to November 2019, shows the main drivers of bank lending are home loans and other personal loans. Loans to industry have continued to shrink during the year as corporates deleverage and repay their debt.

HDFC Bank has managed to outdo the industry because of its strong retail credit franchise. The bank’s unsecured loan portfolio, which is growing at 8% per month, has crossed Rs 1 lakh crore and is over 14% of the bank’s portfolio. The largest private bank now has a market share of over 9% of bank credit.

On deposit side too, the bank has managed to grow 25% year-on-year to Rs 10.67 lakh crore as of December 2019 from Rs 8.52 lakh crore a year ago. The bank’s deposits stood at Rs 10.21 lakh crore, as of September 2019.

In the quarter ended December 2019, the lender purchased loans worth Rs 4,258 crore through the direct assignment route under the home loan arrangement with parent HDFC.

The banking industry recorded year-on-year deposit growth of 10.1% with aggregate deposits of Rs 130 lakh crore as of December 20, 2019. HDFC Bank’s market share would be about 8% given the mid-December industry numbers.

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) on Monday said select banks in India can offer forex rates to Indian clients beyond the inter-bank market hours, which now run from 9am to 5pm. In effect, this opens up the forex market in India round the clock, allowing Indians to hedge their foreign exchange risks at any time of the day. This will also make the offshore currency markets in Dubai and Singapore less attractive for Indian investors, market players said.

“It has been decided to accept the recommendation of the task force on offshore rupee market to permit authorised dealers category-1 banks to offer foreign exchange prices to users at all times, out of their Indian books, either by a domestic sales team or through their overseas branches,” the RBI said in a notification.

“Transactions with persons resident outside India, through their foreign branches and subsidiaries may also be undertaken beyond onshore market hours,” it said.

The decision to allow forex market on a 24x7 basis is significant, especially for clients to manage overnight currency risk as they can now hedge beyond local market hours, said a market source.

61,['7/01/2020'],Murugappa heir issues threat over 8% stake,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Chennai: A fourth-generation family member of the diversified Murugappa Group has warned other promoter family members, including uncles, of “patience running thin” if an immediate buyout plan of their stake did not happen, forcing her to explore other options.

Nuclear scientist Valli Arunachalam, 59, her techie sister and her mother were bequeathed nearly 8% stake in Ambadi Investments, an unlisted holding company of the group, upon the demise of her father MV Murugappan in September 2017.

Since then, requests to the family to either buy their stake amicably in Ambadi at a fair valuation, or allow representation on the board of the company have fallen on deaf years, she alleged.

She, however, did not divulge details of her valuation expectations.

“We have not received any meaningful response from the family members. What am I to do? While I am optimistic of a solution, patience is also running thin,” she told TOI over phone from New York.

“My father was the family patriarch for more than 20 years. He always wanted things to be amicable and, therefore, even we want it that way. We have offered our stake to the family at a fair price. We have not heard anything for two years,” Arunachalam said.

She said that as a second option, she wanted a board representation in the company.

“We wrote to the board of Ambadi seeking representation on August 13, 2019. The board met in late November but did not decide on my application nor called for a shareholder meeting,” she said.

“Look at the family in the management of the group. It’s only male members. It is not that we (women) do not have expertise in running a company. Just that we have not been given a chance in the affairs of the business of the group,” she said.

She is a nuclear scientist, and her sister Vellachi has been working with tech companies for the past 10 years.

“At this stage, we are one of the largest shareholder blocks and we have no visibility nor have a fair representation.”

Murugappa Group did not wish to comment as it was a matter in the affairs of a privately held holding company and not the business ventures.

While Arunachalam said that she will wait to hear from the family, she also warned, “we do have to look at other options” as the family has “parked their responsibility”.

She said for any settlement, there has to be an intent.

“We have an intent to settle this. The other side must also have the intent and call for a focused discussion on the subject. There are many innovative ways to do a settlement. All we want is intent,” she said.

Murugappa Group runs 28 businesses across financial services ( Cholamandalam ), engineering ( Tube Investments ), fertilisers (Coromandel) and sugar (EID Parry), among others, and earns nearly Rs 37,000 crore in annual revenues with more than 50,000 employees.

The bigger impact has been on transportation. “Truck rentals are already up in the January 1-6 period. Rental trends are up 3%-4% on trunk routes after being low 2%- 2.5% during December ‘19,” he added.

The rise would have been sharper, had the economy been in top gear.

The combination of rising fuel prices and rupee depreciation “could further impact consumer spending,” said SP Singh, senior fellow & coordinator, IFTRT.

Since November-December 2018, fleet utilisation for the full calendar year 2019 had dropped by over 30% on a national average.

“Key trunk routes like Delhi-Mumbai-Delhi were down -20%,” said Singh.The current firming up of rentals is entire driven by fuel prices, he added.

Students stage a protest at main Gate of JNU over Sunday's violence, in New Delhi (File photo)

PATNA: Following the violent attack at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi, many students, who hail from Bihar , are reportedly leaving the campus with packed bags and heading home. Their parents, they say, have called them back immediately, fearing recurrence of similar incidents in future.

Some students, who are still in a state of shock, talked to this newspaper over phone from Delhi on Monday and recounted their experiences at the university. Gopalganj resident Atique Quasmi, who is pursuing MPhil at JNU, was on the campus when students and faculty members were assaulted by a group of masked men on Sunday.

Atique said, “I was not hurt, but many of my friends were brutally beaten up. My parents have been calling me up and asking me to go back home because they are concerned about my safety.”

Another JNUite, Ravi Pandey from Nawada, who is studying international relations, claimed, “I am scared because this is for the first time that I have witnessed so much violence. My parents are equally terrified and want me to return home.”

Many, who could not return home, shifted to safer places on Monday. JNU student Yash Sharma, also a native of Bihar, was so frightened that he left the campus and went to Noida. He said, “My parents, who live in Patna, told me to move to my uncle’s house this morning.”

Ex-students also shared their views on the violent attack at JNU. Chandrakanta Khan, a Patna-based social activist and alumna of JNU (1988 batch), rued, “Whatever happened at JNU was extremely unfortunate. Being a former student of the institution, I am absolutely devastated. It is unacceptable.”

Another alumnus, Sandeep Kumar (2014 batch) from Madhubani, condemned the violence. “I have many friends, who are still studying at JNU. I am worried for them. This should not have happened,” he said.

64,['7/01/2020'],Civic body to renovate Phalke memorial on its own,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to renovate the Dadasaheb Phalke Memorial Park on its own and outsource its maintenance to a private agency, following poor response to the tender it had floated for renovation.

The civic body has roped in a consultancy firm to chalk out a detailed plan for the renovation project, the cost of which was estimated at around Rs 5 crore, which was to be borne by the private agency concerned.

The tender had been floated to develop the memorial on design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) basis under public private partnership (PPP).

“A higher investment cost was the major hurdle behind the poor response to the tender we had floated. Hence, the decision to develop the park on its own. The NMC will spend all the necessary amount. The maintenance work will be outsourced,” said civic officials on Monday.

Meanwhile, the contract for maintaining the park has already ended with the private agency, following which it was extended by a month to January 31.

Spread across 29 acres of land, the memorial park displays the works of the late Dadasaheb Phalke and has a beautiful garden in its courtyard.

It is in the surroundings of the majestic Pandava caves (Pandavleni Caves). The area houses lawns, musical fountains and museums that display the Phalke’s works. It is also adjacent to Buddha Memorial Park, which is spread on 11 acres.

The NMC intends to develop the entire complex spread on 40 acres of the park to its full potential and thereby convert it to a tourism hub in Nashik.

The civic body wants to introduce leisure and entertainment facilities, green zone, garden and bird park for tourists at the site through on PPP basis.

65,['7/01/2020'],Retail investors should avoid kneejerk reaction: Experts,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Mumbai: Small and retail investors should not panic and take a hasty decision with their money and other investments in the current volatile market, brokers and investment advisers have said. They add that it’s the geopolitical situation in the Middle East which is leading to jitters in global markets. While it is also impacting India, the domestic market is likely to be less affected than those that are more closely linked to the stand-off between the US and Iran.

“For retail investors, the safest thing now is not to do anything in this volatile situation,” said KR Choksey Investment Managers MD Deven Choksey. “Allow some clarity to emerge...it’s always better to operate when there’s clarity about the investment environment,” he added. Choksey believes that since Iran is already under economic and trade sanctions imposed by the US, not much of its oil is coming into the global market.

However, what could change this situation is if Iran blocks the Strait of Hormuz — one of the world’s most important sea passages through which about a fourth of global crude is shipped, said another broker.

Investment advisers too believe that it’s difficult to pinpoint for how long the current geopolitical tensions could continue and how it could end.

“The main factor that is currently pulling the Indian market down has its origin outside the country. So it’s difficult to predict when it could end and how,” said Arun Kejriwal, director of investment advisory firm KRIS. Kejriwal also believes that once the current volatility subsides, small and midcap stocks, which witnessed lacklustre trades during the past several months, could be the sectors to watch out for.

Brokers also believe that foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), who pumped over $14 billion into Indian stocks in 2019 and nearly $20 billion across all assets classes — including debt and hybrid instruments — may not be in a hurry to take money out of the country. However, among the various types of foreign investors, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to be the first to sell in a major way in case the slide continues for some more time. On Monday, the sensex and Nifty both lost nearly 2% each.

Investment advisers also said that in case an investor has extra cash to invest, he should put the same either in savings bank account, short-term FDs or liquid funds. They also said that if an investor already has a financial plan in place and has been investing according to that to reach life’s financial goals, investments under such plans should not be stopped or changed just because the market has turned volatile.

66,['7/01/2020'],Now fish water to be used to draw leopards near cages,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Surat: In an unconventional approach to keep a leopard away, the forest department has been advising villagers to sing loudly while crossing fields alone. Now in yet another strange method, the forest officials are trying to draw leopards close to the cages by sprinkling water used to wash fish near the cages. After leopards killed two children and injured one in Surat and Bharuch, attempts are being made to trap it at the earliest before it can target any other human.

“We are sprinkling water in which fish, especially bumla or Bombay duck, was kept and cleaned. The water with strong smell of fish is being sprinkled around the cage and the track of leopard to bring the wild cat close to the cage and trap it,” said Puneet Nayyar, deputy conservator of forest, Surat.

The forest department normally keeps bait of chicken or goat in cages to attract the leopards. However, for a stronger smell in current situation, the forest officials are now using the water in which fish is kept for better results.

The forest department has placed 13 cages in Mandvi around Patal village and nearby locations to trap the leopard that killed the four-year-old daughter of a sugarcane harvesting labourer on January 2. They have installed 12 night vision cameras as well at strategic locations to capture the leopard’s movements.

Meanwhile, the forest department has started an awareness campaign and trained 25 leopard ambassadors in rural areas of Surat to prevent human-animal conflict. As part of the drive, villagers are being educated to avoid going alone in fields, and if they are going, they are asked to sing loudly to keep the big cats away. The villagers are also advised against going in open to answer nature’s call and keep precautions while harvesting sugarcane.

“Along with efforts to cage the leopards, we are also trying that the sugarcane harvesting labourers are shifted to safer locations. We held a meeting in the leadership of the district collector with the officials of sugar factories on Monday in which the workers were instructed to ensure that the labourers were provided shelter near village and not in farms,” Nayyar told TOI.

NO TOP HONCHOS OF SUGAR FACTORIES ATTEND MEETING

Despite the deaths of two children of sugarcane harvesting labourers and injury to one, no top officials of sugar factories attended the meeting with district collector Dhaval Patel on Monday. The officials of sugar factories from Madhi, Sayan, Mahuva, Kantha Vibhag, Kamrej and Chalthan remained present. However, no chairman or managing director of these sugar factories attended the meeting. Yet, the forest officials claimed that the factories had sent their officers from the operations department and they were likely to take some steps.

67,['7/01/2020'],Shivalik first co-op to get small bank licence,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Mumbai: Shivalik Mercantile Co-operative Bank has become the first in the sector to get permission from the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) to convert into a small finance bank (SFB). The Saharanpur-headquartered Shivalik MCB is a multi-state co-operative lender with presence in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The bank had deposits of Rs 1,051 crore and advances of Rs 715 crore as of end-March 2019.

Meanwhile, the RBI also decided to rationalise the supervisory action framework (SAF) to make it more effective in bringing about the desired improvement in urban co-operative banks (UCBs) as also expeditious resolution of UCBs experiencing financial stress. The RBI will continue to monitor asset quality, profitability and capital/net worth of UCBs under the revised SAF.

Co-operatives are governed under state laws as well as by RBI norms. They are owned by the customers and have restrictions on their activities. SFBs are like corporate entities limited by shares. They have much more flexibility in raising finances from the banking system. They are a new category of commercial banks that have been created to cater to small borrowers. Initially, only microfinance companies could convert into SFBs. However, in December 2019, the RBI came out with guidelines allowing co-operatives also to convert.

In a statement issued here, the RBI said that the permission has been granted under the ‘Scheme on voluntary transition of urban co-operative bank into a small finance bank’ issued on September 27, 2018. “The ‘in-principle’ approval granted will be valid for 18 months to enable the applicant to comply with the requirements under the scheme and fulfil other conditions as stipulated by the RBI. On being satisfied that the applicant has complied with the requisite conditions laid down by it as part of ‘in-principle’ approval, the RBI would consider granting it a licence for commencement of banking business under Section 22 (1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as an SFB,” the RBI said.

The RBI had decided to allow co-operatives to convert into SFBs in pursuance of the recommendations of a high-powered committee on UCBs chaired by R Gandhi in 2015. Until now, DCB Bank (erstwhile Development Credit Co-operative Bank) was the only co-operative lender to convert into a commercial bank and receive a new private bank licence in 1995.

Other lenders like Saraswat Co-operative Bank had shown an interest into transitioning into commercial banks. However, the RBI has decided to allow conversions only into SFBs, which cannot give loans to corporates.

68,['7/01/2020'],JNU attack: Diaspora raises protest pitch,"This story is from January 7, 2020

The gathering on the steps of SOAS on Monday

KOLKATA: Soon after the images of the masked mob attack in JNU on Sunday evening went viral, students from SOAS University of London’s India Society decided to raise their voice in protest. A decision was taken to call all students and academics to the SOAS Steps on Monday morning to protest against the “brutality and violence” — a gathering that was attended by 50-60 people.

Social media was quick to spread the word. Adrija, a post- doctoral research fellow at SOAS, and a part of SOAS India Society, told TOI that for two-and-a-half years now, the group has been organizing protests “against the current regime”. “Our aim has been to build a platform of critique of what is happening in India now,” she said.

A few weeks ago, the society had organized a protest march outside the India House after CAB was passed. The aim of Monday’s protest, however, was not only to condemn the attack in JNU.

“Of course, we strongly stand against that. But the JNU incident didn’t happen in isolation. It is a product of years of hate that has been propagated by this current regime. We stand against this right-wing fascism, culture of hate and CAA-NRC,” Adrija added.

Kalpana Wilson, who teaches at Birkbeck, University of London and is a member of South Asia Solidarity Group, has signed a letter expressing solidarity with JNU students. She felt it was crucial that academics and students all over the world make their voices heard against what she called a “horrific premeditated attack by far-right thugs who had the backing of the administration and police”.

“After the brutal police violence against students in Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University, this is another attempt to silence students exercising basic democratic rights to dissent by the Modi-Shah fascist regime. But we can see from the wave of solidarity protests against CAA-NRC, and now against these attacks, that Modi is getting completely exposed internationally and in the diaspora,” added Wilson, whose research pertains to India.

Even Bangladeshis based in London joined the protests. London-based architect and artist Sofia Karim rescheduled a meeting to be at the SOAS steps on Monday.

Speaking to TOI, Karim said that as a British-Bangladeshi Muslim, she is alarmed by the nightmare unfolding in India, the country of her parents’ birth. “This is not just an India issue. This affects the whole of South Asia, in particular my motherland, Bangladesh, and indeed the world. The world’s largest secular democracy has steadily turned into a fascist, Hindu fundamentalist state, with relative ease. That is ominous and should be a lesson for the world,” she said.

Dalai Lama

GAYA: The five-day-long teaching schedule of Buddhist spiritual leader His holiness the Dalai Lama ended on Monday. The programme began on January 2 with his teachings to his followers on how to develop virtues of compassion and renunciation of worldly pleasures and exchange of own happiness with other people’s pain among others.

Several thousand followers of the Dalai Lama from different countries of the world, including USA, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, Korea and Taiwan among others participated in the programme. Hollywood actor Richard Gere, a prominent follower of the Buddhist spiritual leader, especially flew in to participate on all the five days of the special teaching programme.

Besides giving tips on acquisition of wisdom and futility of worldly possessions, the Dalai Lama also introduced the initiation protocol and completed the wheel of teachings of Manjushri , the gentle glory associated with the path of wisdom. On the final day of the programme, longevity pills- a sacred eatable was distributed among the participants. Monks holding the longevity pill in bamboo baskets moved among the participants distributing the pill believed to give more years to the recipient’s life. The devotees also prayed for the spiritual leader’s long life and good health. A few years ago, the spiritual leader had to abandon the Kalchakra Puja mid way on account of health issues.

Earlier, on November 10 last year, the 84-year-old Dalai Lama had said that he had a dream about his life extending to 113 years.

Besides the followers from across the world, several high-ranking Tibetan monks and senior officials of the Tibetan administration in exile participated in the programme, which was broadcast live on FM in different languages including Hindi and Tibetan. Each teaching session lasted about 90 minutes.

According to sources, chief minister Nitish Kumar may shortly visit Bodh Gaya to meet the Dalai Lama. For the last many years, the CM makes it a point to meet the Dalai Lama whenever the spiritual leader is in Bodh Gaya. On his part, Dalai Lama has been profusely praising the CM and lauding the prohibition policy of his government.

Before his proposed departure on January 17, Dalai Lama is scheduled to visit IIM Bodh Gaya on January 14.

Cyrus Mistry (File photo)

MUMBAI: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Monday dismissed the application of the Registrar of Companies (RoC)-Mumbai that had sought the removal of certain observations from the December 18, 2019 judgment in the Cyrus Mistry vs Ratan Tata matter.

It also refused to amend its judgment because of the “absence of any factual or legal error apparent on the body of it”. The NCLAT said the RoC-Mumbai had a wrong perception as no observation was made against it. The judgment “does not cast any aspersions on RoC-Mumbai,” the NCLAT said in its 20-page order on Monday.

RoC-Mumbai had filed the application as it found certain strictures passed by the NCLAT in the December 18 judgment, against its statutory actions, were unwarranted and against the principles of natural justice, which require that the concerned party be given an opportunity of being heard before a judgment is passed against it. The December 18 judgment stated that the conversion of Tata Sons from a deemed public limited to a private company was done in a hurried manner with the help of RoC-Mumbai and that the action of RoC-Mumbai was illegal. RoC-Mumbai wanted “with the help of RoC-Mumbai” and “illegal” to be deleted from the 172-page judgment.

The NCLAT, however, clarified that hurry in the judgment was referred to be on the part of Tata Sons and its board of directors to change its status and “nothing has been alleged against RoC-Mumbai”. It added that it is its finding in the judgment that the action taken by the RoC-Mumbai was “prejudicial“ and “oppressive” to the minority shareholders of Tata Sons, specifically to Cyrus Mistry and his family; and “no specific malafide action has been alleged against RoC-Mumbai”.

Monday’s order was pronounced by Justice S J Mukhopadhyay and Justice Bansi Lal Bhat.

Mukhtar Ansari

VARANASI: A criminal gunned down by Ghazipur police in an encounter over a decade ago had procured arms licence in 2001 on the recommendation of jailed mafia-turned-politician and legislator Mukhtar Ansari .

The matter came to light during arms licence verification across Mau district ahead of Ghosi assembly by-poll in October 2019 after which Mau SP Anurag Arya ordered a probe under an additional superintendent of police.

After investigation revealed that four persons, including the criminal killed in encounter, procured arms licences in 2001 on the recommendation of Ansari, an FIR was lodged against six persons on Sunday night.

Besides Ansari, the other accused named in the FIR include then station officer, Dakshintola, JK Singh, then lekhpal Israel Ansari, Anwar, Shahzad and Salim. They were booked under sections 419 (cheating by impersonation), 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 467, 468 (forgery), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC and the Arms Act.

Talking to TOI, SP Anurag Arya said: “Arms licence verification was initiated across Mau district ahead of Ghosi assembly by-poll in October 2019 in which four licence-holders, identified as Anwar, Salim, Shahzad and Mohd Shah Alam, were found missing.”

They had applied for arms licences for double-barrel guns in 2001 for which Mukhtar Ansari, in capacity of Mau MLA, wrote to then district magistrate on his letter pad asking him to issue licences to applicants.

The investigation also exposed the role of then station officer and lekhpal, JK Singh and Israel, who showed fake addresses of four applicants as verified.

While tracing the whereabouts of licence-holders, the investigator found that one of them, Mohd Shah Alam, was killed in a police encounter in Ghazipur between 2005 and 2010.

“Specific details of Alam’s killing in police encounter has been sought from Ghazipur police. The other three, who did not turn up to surrender their arms despite DM’s order, are untraceable. Efforts are on to trace them,” the SP said.

Mukhtar is in jail since 2006. His son Abbas Ansari was also booked in a case of cheating and contravention of gun licence at Lucknow’s Mahanagar police station on October 13, 2019. On October 17, police had seized six weapons and 4,431 cartridges from Abbas’s residence in Delhi.

72,['7/01/2020'],‘Roko Toko’ campaign across Bihar to tame criminals: DGP,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Gupteshwar Pandey

PATNA: Jubilant over its success in Bhagalpur district, the state police headquarters has decided to implement the ‘ Roko Toko ’ (stop and find out) campaign across the state.

Under the campaign, police personnel on the night patrolling intercept the passersby and those travelling either in cars or riding motorbikes in the localities considered vulnerable from security point of view and carry out searches accordingly. Each team is headed by a senior police officer, who is assigned to send the report of the operation on WhatApp group of the district police.

DGP Gupteshwar Pandey said the ‘Roko Toko’ campaign would be implemented in other districts as well. “Such deterrent action is necessary to check the incidents of crime in the state during night hours,” he said, adding, “it would send a message to the people that police are alert round the clock.”

The campaign was launched in Bhagalpur on an experimental basis and turned out to be a success story with the arrest of over 300 antisocials, including a few notorious criminals, and seizure of one dozen illegal weapons in the last two weeks alone. Besides, several major incidents of crime were foiled by the police.

Bhagalpur SSP Ashish Bharti said on Monday that the campaign, which was launched on December 25 last, yielded desired results. “The presence of police not only works as a deterrent to crime but also instils a sense of security among the law-abiding people,” he said. The SSP said a notorious gangster, Suraj Tanti, was nabbed during the campaign. He was evading arrest in several cases of murder, loot, extortion and dacoity in different parts of the district. “The list of the wanted criminals arrested during the night vigil as part of the ‘Roko Toko’ campaign is long,” he added.

According to the SSP, the district headquarters town recorded only three major incidents of crime in December. The crime graph, which usually increases during winter as most people prefer to remain indoors during night, has maintained a downward trend in the district, Bharti said.

Among the arrested were also those who were found violating the Prohibition and Excise Act 2016. “The team is equipped with breathalysers to conduct medical test of the alcoholics on the spot,” the SSP said.

The Bhagalpur police, in fact, had started the exercise in November 2018 when SM Khopde, now ADG (operation), was zonal IG of Bhagalpur. However, the campaign did not have tangible results in Bhagalpur town.

Under the campaign, the city SPs or the DSPs are assigned to monitor the campaign on rotational basis. “The follow-up action is more helpful in reining in the lawbreakers. Simultaneous raids are conducted to arrest those who managed either to give the police a slip or evaded arrest for long in criminal cases,” a senior police officer said.

KOLKATA: The traffic police have decided to slap compound fines or tow away vehicles belonging to all those caught flouting traffic rules during office hours. The focus will be on bikes and buses in an effort to cut down on accidents between 8am and 11am and between 6pm and 9pm. Lalbazar has prepared an exhaustive list of the enhanced fines and the specific sections under which they can be implemented.The sergeants are usually held up in ensuring smooth traffic flow during office hours and can’t keep a close watch on rule-breakers. Compounding of cases will not only increase the fine amount but also make sure that the violations get logged on to the master sheet maintained by the cops.“The traffic police have been instructed to pump up the fines through compound challans. On Sunday evening, for example, a biker at Jadavpur was issued a challan Rs 6,700 for violating several laws at the same time — not carrying licence, damaged number plate and riding with a pillion rider very dangerously. Another biker, in the Jorabagan-Shyampukur area, was fined Rs 5,200. Vehicles are being seized as part of a special drive to ensure there is a total stop to reckless riding and driving. The aim now is to bring down accidents during office hours when cops usually refrain from campaigns. Special teams have been formed, which are carrying out checks without holding up traffic,” said an officer.“There was a tendency to break speed limits due to the comparatively lower number of vehicles on the roads on Sunday. By 2pm, each traffic guard recorded at least two compounded prosecutions — slapping of more than one Motor Vehicles (MV) Act sections and increasing the fine amount. The focus is on high-speed corridors, like EM Bypass, the Bypass connectors and Harish Mukherjee Road,” said another officer.“Each traffic guard has been asked to identify stretches which witness maximum rule violations,” said an officer.The task, claimed cops, will be to discipline bikers and bus drivers in the first two weeks.The police also said they are using social media platforms, like Twitter and Facebook, to make people aware that they are under watch on the roads via sergeant cameras and CCTV cameras.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73133616,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-123874,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/steep-fine-rule-sees-biker-shelling-out-rs-6700/articleshow/73129222.cms

Addressing about 500 BJP activists on the IMA premises in Gaya , SuMo said that no incidence of victimisation of Muslims has taken place in the state. “Congress and the Leftists are creating an atmosphere of fear among minorities for their own political gains,” he said.

The deputy CM was in Gaya to spread awareness among BJP functionaries and workers on issues like Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). The party workers and functionaries, in turn, have been asked to launch a campaign for creating awareness on the issue and remove the doubts of the people, particularly minorities.

Reiterating the party line that CAA was about giving and not taking away citizenship, SuMo said that persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan , most of them belonging to the underprivileged sections, would benefit from the provisions of the CAA, which, in any case would not put any additional economic burden on the country.

“These people are already living in the country and citizen status would make them entitled to welfare schemes of the government, including education and poverty alleviation measures,” SuMo said.

He regretted that despite PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah making it clear many a time that CAA and NRC were altogether different and no discussion on NRC has taken place at any level in the government and yet canards were being spread to keep a section of the population in perpetual fear. “It is time such elements are exposed,” he said.

About NPR, the deputy CM said it is purely an economic exercise introduced by former PM Manmohan Singh with the object of creating a comprehensive and credible database for the purpose of economic planning in the country and it has nothing to do with politics.

“The NPR proforma was developed in the Congress regime and the previous proforma has only been updated to include items like use of internet among others. The last proforma did not seek information about the use of internet. Moreover, no documentary proof would be needed and information provided by the people would be accepted at face value with no questions asked,” he said.

Later talking to mediapersons in Gaya circuit house, SuMo said that UP CM Yogi Adityanath would be visiting Gaya on January 14 to explain the party’s stand on issues like CAA, NPR and NRC. “The UP CM would be addressing a public meeting in Gandhi Maidan in Gaya to clear doubts and misinformation on the issue,” he said.

BJP’s ‘Jan Jagran’ campaign in support of the CAA pushed Bettiah to the edge on Sunday

BETTIAH: BJP’s ‘Jan Jagran’ campaign in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) pushed Bettiah to the edge on Sunday as hordes of youth ran amok with provocative sloganeering in fast moving motorcycle rallies and foot marches through the town square in Lal Bazar and alleys crisscrossing the heart of town.

The bikers and foot soldiers were also seen carrying abusive placards and banners as the national tricolour was dwarfed in the swathe of saffron flags. A skirmish was contained from conflagrating within moments near the Jangi Masjid with the DM Nilesh Ramchandra Deore and SP Nitasha Gudiya rushing to the spot.

At the modest Maharaja Library ground, BJP state president Sanjay Jaiswal, who is also the local MP, led a chain of party leaders including state health minister Mangal Pandey with speeches supporting the CAA. The health minister diagnosed ‘stomach-ache’ in the Congress over the CAA. He said earlier Congress governments too had granted citizenship to persecuted refugees from neighbouring countries but now when the Modi government has brought in the Act, the Congress has been afflicted with ‘paet me dard’.

Meanwhile, a different ache was palpable in town as the foul-mouthing bikers and foot marchers, carrying flags and sticks spread fear among the section of society they trained their exuberant tongue-lashing on.

“Their slogans were abusive...some youths protested...they pushed an old man into the drain...a skirmish resulted. Fortunately the DM and SP came here within minutes,” Maulana Nazimuddin Ahmad Khan, Imam of the Jangi Masjid, said.

At the Madarsa Islamia adjoining the Badi Masjid, about a dozen women were seen getting their names verified in the voters list even as small boys chanted their readings in unison. “No, this has nothing to do with NPR or CAA...That we will not agree to,” Nessar Ahmed Quasmi, Qazi Shariat with the Imarat-e-Sharia, said.

Away from the Qazi’s apprehensions, BJP state chief Jaiswal was trying to allay fears at the Library ground: “We need to dispel the rumour mongering. The minorities are being misled,” he said, asserting, “Nobody’s citizenship will be taken away. But we will not allow citizenship to ‘ghoospaithiya’ (intruders) at any cost.”

An unruly mob that included boys as young as eight to ten years brandished sticks and struck at closed shop hoardings around Meena Bazar despite the heavy police bandobast. The cops responded with a mild lathi charge in the Raj Deorhi.

77,['7/01/2020'],Rajiv case: HC grants 15 days leave to convict Ravichandran,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Madurai: Ravichandran, a life convict in the former Prime Minister (PM) Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, has been granted 15 days ordinary leave by the Madras high court from January 10. P Rajeswari of Aruppukottai taluk in Virudhunagar district, mother of Ravinchandran in her petition had stated that her son, who was awarded life sentence in the case had completed nearly 28 years of imprisonment.

Though she had submitted several representations and moved the high court seeking leave for her son, it was not granted. Recently, she moved the high court, which on October 15, directed the state to consider her representation within three weeks. Subsequently, the superintendent of Madurai Central Prison passed an order on November 13 rejecting her claim on the ground that Virudhunagar superintendent of police had submitted a report stating that there was a possibility of life threat to her son and it would not be possible for the police to provide escort as police selection process and local body elections were to be announced. Hence, Rajeswari moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to grant one-month ordinary leave to Ravichandran to enable him settle the family after his release.

When the petition was taken up for hearing on Monday, the petitioner’s counsel submitted that recently ordinary leave was also granted to few other convicts in the case including Nalini Sriharan, Perarivalan and the same could also be extended to Ravichandran.

The additional advocate general K Chellapandian submitted that since more than 20 police officials are required for the convict’s escort and the same would not be possible due to the intervening local body elections, the representation seeking ordinary leave was rejected. He further submitted that the state would consider the ordinary leave plea after Pongal festival.

Taking note of the submissions, a division bench of justice T Raja and justice B Pugalendhi observed that the convict had been earlier granted ordinary leave five times since 2001 - four times based on the order of the high court and once based on the order of the prison authorities to attend the final rites of his father.

The judges observed that on all five occasions when ordinary leave was granted, the life convict had surrendered before prison authorities without causing any inconvenience. They further observed that the state in its counter had mentioned that his leave application had been rejected due to local body elections and it would not be able to provide sufficient protection for the convict.

The judges observed that even though the local body elections were completed, the government’s contention that it would consider the ordinary leave plea after Pongal festival is not acceptable. Hence, the judges granted 15 days leave to Ravichandran and observed, “Let him spend time with his family on this Pongal.” The judges directed him to surrender before the prison authorities after the completion of 15 days ordinary leave. The matter has been posted to January 28 for reporting compliance.

PATNA: In a daring act, two motorbike-borne youths looted Rs2.5 lakh from an agent of Barauni dairy on the busy Annie Besant Road under Pirbahore police station area in the state capital on Monday. It was the fourth case of loot in Patna district in the last 48 hours.

Police said two youths riding a motorbike intercepted one Abhishek Kumar on the Annie Besant Road around 1.30pm and looted a bag containing the cash from him at pistol point. The robbers, who had covered their faces with mufflers, also fired a shot in the air to terrorize the local businessmen and the passersby.

The criminals, who were in the age group of 20-25 years, however, fled the spot, leaving the victim in a state of shock. Police said Abhishek had collected the money from different counters of milk parlours and was on way to Bhootnath Road in Patna City subdivision to deposit the money in the bank account of the dairy.

Pirbahore police station SHO Rizwan Ahmad Khan said efforts were on to ascertain the identity of the robbers with the help of the CCTV footages in the area. Nobody was injured in the firing incident, he added.

DSP (Town) Suresh Prasad, however, claimed that police have collected some clues about the robbers. “We will crack the case at the earliest,” he said, adding that raids were on to nab the criminals involved in the crime. A case was lodged with the Pirbahore police station on the victim’s statement.

Locals told the police that the robbery came to light only when the victim raised an alarm. “The robbers dashed against the victim’s motorbike from behind on the road. As a result, he fell on the ground. We thought that the victim was hit from behind in an accident,” a police officer quoted a local shopkeeper as saying.

Earlier on Sunday, armed criminals looted Rs. 6.05 lakh in three separate incidents from areas falling under Kadamkuan, Digha and Naubatpur police stations in Patna district.

Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma, who assumed charge on Thursday, had categorically told the police officers to pull up their socks failing which stern disciplinary action would be taken against them.

Sharma held a meeting with the SHOs and gave tips on how to control crime. Sharma, who had earlier served as City SP in Patna, visited different police stations soon after he assumed charge as SSP. He has replaced Garima Malik, who has been promoted to the rank of DIG and posted in the CID at the headquarters.

One of the puppies whose mother was killed on Monday

HYDERABAD: In yet another heart-wrenching incident, a lactating dog was beaten to death by a drunk man at Gangaputra colony in Hasmathpet on Sunday night.

A passerby was in for a shock when the man, Pothula Sai Kumar (45), who was drunk and armed with an iron rod, beat up the dog in its stomach until it lost consciousness and succumbed to injuries.

“I was passing by the area when I saw this man pick up an iron rod and beat the dog mercilessly in its stomach. The man did not stop hitting the dog even though it was crying in pain. The dog was lactating and died in front of its three puppies,” said Kota Nandini, a resident of Hasmathpet.

Nandini, who lodged a complaint with the police, added that the man is not just a threat to the dogs but to the entire locality.

Meanwhile, an animal activist who was informed about the incident rushed to the spot and took custody of the three puppies. “The puppies were shivering and looked very scared when I found them. After rescuing them from the spot where this man brutally attacked their mother, I brought one puppy home, asked Nandini to take the second one and the third puppy is with one my colleagues. We will be taking care of them until we find someone who can adopt these puppies,” said Aanchal Khanna, an animal welfare activist.

The police took the accused into custody and registered a case under IPC Section 428 ( Mischief by killing or maiming cattle), Sections 11 (1) (I) of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960.

In a similar incident that took place in October last year, a dog which was being taken care of by the community, sustained multiple bleeding wounds after being attacked with an axe by a woman in an inebriated state.

The woman, in an inebriated condition, walked out of her home with an axe and proceeded to attack the dog which had been living in the area for several years. The woman has allegedly attacked and killed dogs in the past as well.

Speaking to TOI, Dr Purnima Nagaraja, mental health professional, Dhrithi Wellness Clinic, said, “Cruelty to animals can also be due to anti-social personality disorder. This can happen when there is no outlet for emotion. In some cases, people commit such crimes because they derive pleasure out of someone else’s pain. These are nothing but personality disorders.”

Stating that it was important to identify the behavioral patterns at an early stage and see that people do not commit such crimes, she said that it is likely for such people to hurt human beings in the same way they are cause harm to animals.

Varanasi: Even 18 days after the police action on people protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) in which an eight-year-old boy Sageer lost his life in the ensuing stampede, the aggrieved family is yet to get any compensation from the government.

A financial assistance of Rs. 3 lakh through public contributions was provided to the boy’s family immediately after the incident. “We were given Rs 3 lakh cash by the Bhelupur police, although we do not know if it was official contribution. The district magistrate too had promised official financial assistance, which is yet to come,” said the boy’s grandmother Shehnaz Akhtar.

District magistrate (DM) Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “The amount given to the kin of the boy was arranged through contributions from the public. The process for the compensation from the CM’s discretionary fund has been initiated. We can’t saw when the formalities will be over.”

The incident had occurred in the Muslim dominated Bajardiha locality on December 20 afternoon, when police resorted to cane charge to disperse an agitating mob. The police action resulted in total chaos and stampede. Later, Sageer was found dead and his body was handed over to his family around 4 am after post mortem on December 21, and within an hour his burial was performed amidst tight security.

Sageer was the third among the four sons of Wakil Ahmad, a weaver-turned-cook. The eldest Naseer Ahmad (15) is learning weaving. A 15X12-feet dingy room accommodates 15 family members, including the parents of Wakil and five members of his brother Shakil Ahmad’ s family.

“We had not imagined that Sageer, who had gone out to play with his friends, would never return home,” said Shehnaz. Someone on his phone showed her the picture of Sageer lying on the ground.

“We were told that he was taken to the Trauma Centre of Banaras Hindu University. We rushed to the trauma centre, but we did not see him live,” said the shocked grandmother. The boy’s father was out for his work when the TOI team visited his house on Monday.

Meanwhile, a sense of mistrust and fear against the administration still prevails among the local residents. The kin of those injured in cane charge avoid to meet unknown people, even mediapersons.

For the family members of an injured youth Khalid Zamal (22), who had to spend four days in ICU of BHUs trauma centre, every stranger is suspicious. Fearing the arrival of police, they initially did not open the doors, but allowed the TOI team in when convinced by the local dwellers. Khalid has been advised bed rest for some days after he was discharged from the hospital on December 31.

“I was going to attend a ‘dawat’ (party) of my relative when trapped in the crowed, and lost my sense,” he said.

“The scene of that fateful day still hounds people’s mind. The police used unnecessary force for no reason,” said a local resident, Mohammad Alam Ansari, adding, “The police picked up four persons from their houses and they are still in jail.”

83,['7/01/2020'],Game pulls up officials for not removing illegal hoardings,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Nashik: Civic officials, going slow in taking action against illegal hoardings , were taken to task by municipal commissioner Radhakrisha Game on Monday.

Over 300 illegal hoardings were found in the city during a survey carried out a month ago following which Game had directed the officials concerned to remove them at the earliest. Despite the orders, over 100 illegal hoardings are yet to be removed.

The issue of illegal hoardings came up during the meeting of head of departments on Monday where Game asked the officials concerned the reason behind the delay. In their defence, the officials said owing to lack of machineries to cut iron pillars they could not remove all the illegal hoardings.

Municipal commissioner then directed divisional officials to purchase all machineries in their power of purchases up to Rs 1 lakh and take out all the illegal hoardings at the earliest.

Illegal hoardings have mushroomed across the city and after Game’s instructions a survey was carried out in all six divisions of the NMC to check for hoardings with and without permissions.

During the survey, the NMC found over 300 illegal hoardings that were erected without permission. Around 2,000 hoardings were found legal and were erected following permissions by the NMC.

Around four months ago, the NMC had undertaken a special drive and removed over 100 illegal hoardings erected on dividers, electric poles and traffic islands. Most of the illegal hoardings were related to political leaders.

These illegal hoardings have again mushroomed in various parts of the city even after action taken by the civic body. Municipal commissioner has also directed the officials to register FIRs against those involved in putting such illegal banners and hoardings.

84,['7/01/2020'],HC seeks SEC response to woman’s plea to declare her elected panchayat president,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Madurai: The Madras high court has sought a response from the state election commission (SEC) and state government on a plea moved by a woman seeking to declare her as the elected member to the post of panchayat president of T Punavasal village in Ramanathapuram district.

S Nagarani, a resident of Ramanathapuram district, in her petition stated that after notification was issued for the rural local body elections, she filed her nomination to contest for the post of panchayat president of T Punavasal village. She stated that another woman candidate A Devaki also filed her nomination for the same post. She claimed that Devaki is the candidate preferred by the ruling AIADMK party and several unethical tactics were used to make her win.

Nagarani submitted that a total of 1,895 votes were polled for electing in the panchayat election and counting of votes was done on January 2 as per schedule. While 27 votes were declared invalid, she secured 986 votes and Devaki secured 882 votes. The election officer had declared her as the winner in the presence of the election observer and started preparing Form 23 and Form 25.

She said that her name was also published in the official website of the SEC as the elected candidate. Following this, Devaki and her supporters caused a commotion inside the counting centre. She claimed that the police officials sent her supporters out of the counting centre instead of removing Devaki and her supporters.

Subsequently, the election officer had issued Form 25 in favour of Devaki, declaring her elected for the post of panchayat president and her name was also displayed in the election commission website. This shows that the election officer who was in connivance with Devaki had political influence. Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to declare the Form 25 issued by the election official in favour of Devaki as illegal and sought to declare her as elected candidate.

When the petition was heard on Monday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran sought response from the SEC and government and adjourned the case for further hearing on January 7.

KOCHI: Even while Cochin Smart Mission Ltd (CSML) authorities hope that they may be able to buy time from the Union government for implementing projects under SmartCity until March 31, 2020, many of the projects included in the scheme are entangled in controversies. Rows have cast shadow on many of the projects like the Rs 166-crore vacuum sewage project, the Rs 21-crore project to construct apartment complex for slum dwellers, the Rs 310-crore intelligent street poles project and the Rs 100-crore Ernakulam market renovation project.In fact, the deadline for beginning all works under SmartCity project was December 31, 2019. Now, the authorities hope that the Union government will grant an extension until March 31, 2020. Due to protests from local residents, CSML authorities are unable to go ahead with the project. The sewage project aims at collecting and treating sewage from all the households and other establishments in five divisions of Kochi corporation at Mattancherry and Fort Kochi areas. “We had awarded the work to a firm and they had started initial work. When the firm conducted soil inspection at the proposed site for the plant near Fort Kochi Taluk Hospital they had to stop the work due to the protests by local residents. It is a project which is beneficial to the residents. But they fear that the project will contaminate their drinking water sources if the pipes carrying sewage leaks,” an official with CSML said. “But the fact is that the plant works on vacuum system. Using the force of vacuum the waste is drawn into the plant through the pipelines. If there is any leak in the pipeline, the system will stop,” the official said. “We had held three rounds of talks with the residents and authorities of hospitals and schools. Now, MLA, mayor and councillors have agreed to convene a meeting of the residents for convincing them,” the official said. “If we lose the project, chances are least for us to get another round of funding for sewage project from the Centre,” the official said.Even while CSML authorities hope that they may be able to buy time from the Union government for implementing projects under SmartCity until March 31, 2020, many of the projects included in the scheme are entangled in controversiesSimilarly, the Ernakulam market renovation is in limbo due to unavailability of land for rehabilitating the merchants. “The land we identified for rehabilitating the merchants from the market is entangled in a legal dispute. Now, we plan to move the high court where a case over ownership of the land is pending. If high court allows our plea, we will be able to go ahead with the project,” said an official associated with the project.Another SmartCity project which has run into trouble is the construction of a ground-plus-eleven-storeyed apartment complex at Fort Kochi for rehabilitating slum dwellers. The plan is to complete the construction of the apartment complex at a cost of Rs 21 crore from SmartCity funds. But, the project is already mired in controversy. Originally, the project was designed and proposed to be implemented by Kochi corporation.

PANAJI: The state’s five engineering and two pharmacy colleges and institutes offering other degree and diploma technical programmes have started the process of preparing their self-assessment reports.Earlier, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) had announced that accreditation by the National Accreditation Board (NAB) would soon be made essential for institutes offering technical undergraduate and postgraduate programmes.The cut-off was set at 2023 after which programmes without the accreditation would be considered unrecognised.NAB is an autonomous body of the MHRD to whom the detailed self-assessment report has to be submitted online by the institutes. Once the report is submitted, an expert committee of three experts for degree programmes and two experts in case of diploma programmes will carry out a physical inspection of the institute.Sources said that for institutes in the state, an internal deadline of July 2020 has been set to submit their self-assessment reports to the NAB.The NBA accredits individual programmes and not institutes, as given by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). NBA accredited fields include engineering and technology, management, pharmacy, architecture, applied arts and crafts, computer applications and hospitality and tourism management.Sources said that most programmes in Goa do not have NAB accreditation. While accreditation is voluntary, in 2017 the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) announced that it will not provide approval for institutes that failed to accredit at least half of their programmes.The purpose of the accreditation is to promote and recognise excellence in technical education in colleges and universities.The NAB was formed on the lines of the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology in the USA. In 2014, NBA was granted a full membership status in the Washington Accord.“The expert committee of the NAB is totally independent. Even the process of inspection is carried out in a manner that has no scope for the institute officials to influence the panel. The accreditation is a quality assurance of the institute. Institutes have to score on parameters with a total weightage of 1,000 points. If an institute scores 750 or above, they will be accredited for five to six years. Those in a lower range of up to 600 get provisional accreditation,” an official said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73131697,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-89476,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/states-institutes-preparing-for-national-accreditation/articleshow/73129354.cms

NASHIK: The Nashik sub-centre of Savitribai Phule Pune University ( SPPU ) has decided to answer all enquiry calls it receives from the students.

Authorities at the sub-centre have deployed a person to attend phone calls and transfer it to the respective personnel for dedicated service.

“We get most of the calls during the time of filling forms and examinations. More than 50 enquiries per day are entertained during these times as students need assistance,” Prashant Tope, co-ordinator of Nashik sub-centre, said.

On other days, the sub-centre receives around 30 enquiries per day. The authorities have also prepared a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) with their answers for regular enquiries.

“The sheet also includes flow charts that help in guiding the students about how to go about filling a form on the website,” Tope said.

“We never like it if our phones go unanswered especially during urgent times. So, we have made it a point that as soon as our office opens at 10.30 am, students’ queries will be entertained over the phone until 6pm. Only during the lunch hour between 1.45 pm and 2.15 pm, we won’t be able to take calls,” he added.

The SPPU sub-centre is open on all working days as per the varsity in Pune. Various other facilities like issuance of migration certificates, display of subject change on the exam form, updating of course dropouts, among others are also being taken care of at the sub-centre.

“We are a link between the university and the students in the city. It would be best if we can help them with maximum services at the sub-centre and that is all we are trying to do,” Tope said, adding that the helpline numbers — 0253-2581434, 0253-2310661 —are available on the varsity website.

Madurai: A public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed before the Madras high court seeking to include a representative from the parayar community in the jallikattu organizing committee at Palamedu.C Santhanam, a resident of Palamedu, stated in his petition that there are more than 15,000 people of different communities including those belonging to parayar, a scheduled caste community, at Palamedu town panchayat. While there are representatives of all communities in the ‘Grama Podhu Mahalinga Swamy Madathu Committee’ which is the organising committee for Palamedu jallikattu, their community (parayar) was not included. When members of the committee decided to conduct the jallikattu on January 16, their plea to include a representative from their community was denied. He stated that not including a representative from their community is discrimination as per Article 14 and Article 17 of the Constitution.

Though people from their community have submitted representation to the officials including the district collector to include their representative in the organizing committee, no steps were taken. Hence the petitioner moved the high court bench seeking direction to the authorities to convene a peace meeting to include a representative from their community in the jallikattu committee this year . The petition would be taken up for hearing on Tuesday.

HYDERABAD: Ahead of Swachh Survekshan 2020, the GHMC’s Directorate of Enforcement Vigilance and Disaster Management (EVDM) wing has decided to monitor complaints raised on Twitter and other social networking sites to catch offenders littering public places.

After a complaint is posted on Twitter or Facebook with a picture of debris being dumped into a lake or a water body by a dump truck , the EVDM officials, with the help of the vehicle number, will catch the offender.

The GHMC, at present, penalises offenders through a mechanism by which the house number or vehicle number is recorded.

“If an individual throws debris or construction material in front of his house, we can catch him with the help of the house number. If someone resorts to open urination, it is not possible to penalise him as we don’t have a facial recognition system to catch hold of him. The aim is to create awareness among people littering the city and to let them know there is an enforcement team monitoring them,” said Kampati, who stressed that the onus of keeping the city clean also lies on the people.

Meanwhile, EVDM director Viswajit Kampati said that the GHMC zonal commissioners can penalise using e-challan system and that the service will be extended to citizens too.

“So far, 4,61,783 civic violations were recorded by EVDM staff who clicked pictures and uploaded them on EVDM portal. Raising flexi banners, sticking wall posters, wall writings and debris dumping were some of the offences reported,” read a statement issued by the EVDM.

We condemn the cowardly act and demand immediate action against those behind the violence,” Kunal Kharat, one of the student leaders, said.

The students also tried to entry the main building, but were prevented by police and security guards. The students also staged a brief sit-in agitation before leaving the campus.

CM Amarinder Singh

CHANDIGARH: Demanding strictest of action against the perpetrators of mayhem at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), irrespective of their political affiliation or ideology, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday asked the Centre and the Delhi governments to ensure urgent restoration of law and order in the country’s premier university.

Amarinder said he lamented the unprecedented attacks and clashes witnessed at Aligarh Muslim University , Jamia Millia University and JNU in recent weeks. He said these incidents had not just marred the country’s international image but caused irrevocable damaged to its education system – one of the key pillars of any nation’s progress and development.

In a statement that blamed Delhi Police and Union and Delhi governments for the unbridled and vicious attacks on students in JNU on Sunday night, Amarinder said, “Where was the Delhi Police when armed goons had a free run of the campus, indulging in brutal attacks on students, staff and teachers? Why did the police force, which had been ruthless in its actions when trouble had broken out in Jamia some days back, suddenly decide to stay back in the case of JNU? Whose orders were they acting on?”

Amarinder was also unsparing in his criticism of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, saying, “How could he not rush to the spot? Was it enough for him to simply tweet his anguish? As chief minister, and more importantly as someone who claims to be the custodian of the welfare of Delhi’s citizens, why did he not intervene personally?”

Endorsing the demand raised by some individuals for Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the developments in JNU, the chief minister said it was necessary to identify and act against not just the assailants behind what appeared to be a pre-planned attack but also those who became co-conspirators by virtue of allowing it to continue unabated. If this kind of incident goes unpunished in the national capital, one can only imagine what could happen in educational institutions in other parts of the country, he warned.

PATIALA: Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal called on former chief minister Beant Singh’s assassin Balwant Singh Rajoana , who is lodged at Patiala Central Jail, on Monday. He was accompanied by SGPC delegation and assured Rajoana that the committee would fight every legal battle to secure his release.

Rajoana had announced that he would go on a hunger strike from January 11 onwards, if a prompt decision on his clemency petition was not taken by the Union government. Longowal said SGPC would explore all possibilities and would even approach the Union government. After the assurance by the SGPC chief, Rajoana has decided to postpone his hunger strike.

Interacting with the mediapersons later, Longowal said during Guru Nanak Dev’s 550th birth anniversary celebrations, the Centre had announced commuting Rajoana’s death sentence to life imprisonment, which could have paved the way for his release from the jail. “However, it is sad that the Union government took a U-turn and Rajoana’s sentence was not commuted. It has hurt the sentiments of the entire Sikh community,” he claimed.

Longowal said that the Shiromani Akali Dal and SGPC were already pursuing Rajoana’s case and an appeal had also made to the President of India in this regard, but no decision had been taken even after eight years. He said the SGPC would even take up the matter with Prime Minister Narender Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah soon.

102,['7/01/2020'],CAA: Punjab and Haryana high court junks plea against imposition of preventive orders in Nuh,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Representative image

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday dismissed a petition seeking directions for withdrawal of imposition of preventive orders under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPc) from Nuh district of Haryana, which was invoked by the district administration to maintain law and order situation in view of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Nuh is Haryana’s only district having a majority of Muslim population.

Nuh advocate Mohammad Arshad had filed a petition filed, seeking directions to set aside the order passed by the district administration on December 25, 2019, whereby the entire district was placed under Section 144, without identifying any imminent threat to public order and tranquility. According to the petitioner, the order is a disproportionate restriction on the rights of civilians, who are not even likely to cause an imminent threat to public order.

It was also submitted that such an action was a clear violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution. The petition also submitted that the Supreme Court has held that Section 144 orders must be issued against the wrongdoer and not against innocent civilians merely on grounds of convenience and expediency.

HC, however, was not convinced with the arguments preferred by the petitioner and dismissed his petition.

ALLAHABAD: A day after five members of a family were found murdered in their house in Soraon, police have arrested six persons named in the FIR but are yet to find out the motive behind brutal kilings.

SSP, Allahabad, Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said, “We have arrested six persons named in the FIR but we are yet to ascertain the motive. Police teams are constantly quizzing the accused. We have also roped in special task force (STF) to crack the case.”

As many as five police teams are working overtime to solve the case.

The SSP said a panel of two doctors performed the autopsy and found that deaths were caused due to deep injuries. “Post-mortem report has ruled out rape of the woman victim before murder,” he said.

Bodies of Somdutt Tiwari (32), owner of a small-scale transport business, his father Vijay Shankar Tiwari (60), wife Soni Tiwari (28) and the couple’s two sons, Kanha (7) and Kunj (2), were found in three separate rooms of their house on Sunday.

The assailants used home tools such as a kitchen knife and a grinding stone to murder them.

Brother of slain woman, Kartikeya Tiwari of Pratapgarh, lodged an FIR under section 147,148,149,302 and 120 B of IPC against seven persons including gram pradhan Pradeep Kumar, Sachidanand Tiwari, Sampurnanad Tiwari, Ambuj Tiwari, Jitendra Kumar Tiwari, Vikas Tiwari, and Satyam Tiwari.

Meanwhile, Congress leader Pramod Tiwari reached post-mortem house on Monday morning and met the kin of the deceased.

State law minister Brijesh Pathak also reached Rasoolabad ghat and assured the kin that the killers would be nabbed soon.

Madurai: Local body representatives elected to various posts in the recently held elections assumed charge on Monday in an atmosphere filled with joy and camaraderie. However, the occasion had its share of drama too as a ward member jumped the wall of the collectorate building allegedly to escape horse-trading. The winners were adorned with huge floral garlands and family members were seen going out of the way to celebrate the occasion. In Madurai district, DMK won 13 of the 23 district panchayat councilor seats as against the AIADMK’s nine while an independent candidate won the remaining seat. The winners assumed charge at a function got up in the hall of the old collectorate building in the presence of district collector Dr T G Vinay and assistant director of panchayats Chelladurai.

Senior AIADMK member and elected representative of the 16th ward, P Aiyappan, was the first to be sworn in by DRO incharge Kannan. The other members including Kasimayan, P Muthupandi (DMK), Akihla (AIADMK) and Rajarajan (DMK) took charge subsequently. DMK north district secretary P Moorthy, among others were present. DMK’s ward 22 member S Keerthika saw her jubilant brother and relatives putting gold rings on her fingers after assuming charge. P Muthupandi decided that it was an occasion to recognize her father-in-law’s contribution to her victory. She invited him on stage and honoured him with a shawl and ‘thalaipagai’.

In a show of strength, DMK MLA Moorthy made all his 13 councillors stand in a row but whisked them away as soon as the ceremony was over. This was to keep them in his control till the district chairman and vice-chairman assume charge on January 11. In Thirumangalam union, the panchayat union councillors of DMK — Muthupandi, Shanthi Murugan and Sonia Vijay — refused to take oath as AIADMK propaganda songs were played loudly in the hall. The ten AIADMK councillors and one each from the DMDK and BJP assumed charge on Monday.Unidentified people set fire to the celebration poster of Nagalakshmi Kasirajan, the newly elected panchayat president of Sakkimangalam in Madurai. Pandeeswari, an independent candidate who was elected president of Karcheri, thanked the villagers at the village square in the presence of her relatives. In Chellampatti, AIADMK has won nine of the 17 wards and the DMK seven. S Aravind, an independent candidate who was elected from ward 8 in the panchayat union, scaled the wall of the building and was whisked away in a waiting car. Sources said he was trying to dodge representatives of the two political parties which have been trying to indulge in horse trading.

106,['7/01/2020'],Eunuchs have no right to perform customary duties unless authorities say so: Punjab and Haryana high court,"This story is from January 7, 2020

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has clarified that unless there is a declaration or decision by competent civil court empowering an eunuch to perform “traditional/customary duties,” the eunuch cannot seek protection of police authorities to ensure performance of such rights.

Justice Sanjay Kumar of the HC passed these orders while dismissing a petition filed by Suman Mahant, a transgender from Muktsar.

In this case, the petitioner had approached the high court as she has been stopped by some persons from performing her traditional or customary duty as an eunuch in the area. She also claimed that she had approached the local police on October 23, 2019 and submitted a representation. In her representation to police, she had sought interference of police in performing her right to carry out traditional/customary duties as a eunuch of Dera Guru Nank Nagari, Malout. As no action or assistance was provided to her by local police, she approached the high court and sought a direction to protect her life, liberty, and property from people who were creating problems for her in performing her customary duties as an eunuch.

Hearing the plea, the high court observed, “Without a competent civil court rendering a declaration/decision as to the petitioner’s claimed right, it would not be open to her to seek protection from the police authorities to give effect to such a right.”

While dismissing the plea, the judge, however, made it clear that this order shall, however, not preclude the petitioner from approaching the jurisdictional police authorities in case any criminal offence is committed warranting appropriate action being taken under the Indian Penal Code .

The HC order is significant as it has now been clarified that an eunuch has no specific right of legal protection for collection of ‘bhadhais (tips)’ as a matter of right in any particular area unless they are specifically empowered for such collection by the local authorities.

Although the authorities would hardly give any permission to eunuchs for collection in any area, some local organizations or group housing societies have fixed rates of tips to be given to the eunuchs in case of any family celebrations.

107,['7/01/2020'],Court pauses SEC notification for municipal election,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Hyderabad: Even as the State Election Commission (SEC) was preparing to issue a notification on Tuesday for municipal elections, the Telangana high court on Monday stopped it till Tuesday evening.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy gave this directive while hearing a PIL filed by Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy, who challenged the action of SEC issuing the poll schedule on December 23 last year without first determining reservations of wards of municipalities and corporations.

The Chief Justice said: “In a democratic set-up, a candidate should be given sufficient time. Furnish us the entire chronology of dates and rules and poll manual by Tuesday.”

The crux of Monday’s hearing mainly revolved around two issues: Why did SEC issue the schedule even before it notified elections? Why did it go ahead before the quota was determined?

Generally, SEC releases the schedule and notification on the same day.

Senior counsel D Prakash Reddy, who appeared for Uttam, said SEC’s action in issuing the schedule first and preparing to release the notification on Tuesday was a violation of Rule 195(1) of the Telangana Municipalities Act. He said the Act clearly mentions that poll notification should be issued first.

The bench questioned SEC as to how it issued the schedule first when the poll notification was to be issued first. “Have reservations for the wards determined? How do you expect a candidate to prepare himself to contest without knowing if his ward is reserved and if so, it’s reserved under which category?” it asked.

The bench further asked: “How do you expect a candidate to obtain a caste certificate at short notice if the ward is indeed reserved to a category that suits him?” It further said if a candidate prepares himself regardless of reservation, there was no guarantee that the ward would be finally reserved for his community. “The plight of a general candidate is no different because he is also not sure whether his ward would remain general or fall into a reserved quota. Hence, finalisation of reservations is a must before issuing the poll schedule and notification,” the bench said.

Appearing for SEC, senior counsel CV Mohan Reddy said that reservation of wards was a task to be performed by the state government. “We issued the schedule on December 23, asking the voters to be ready to vote and that a poll notification would be issued on January 7,” Reddy said. He said they were working in coordination with the government.

The bench posted the matter to Tuesday.

108,['7/01/2020'],Experts laud T scope for growth as 60 EIAs await Centre’s nod,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Hyderabad: With as many as 60 projects under Centre’s scrutiny, Telangana stands fourth in the country in terms of number of environment impact assessments ( EIA ) behind Gujarat (108 projects), Maharashtra (87) and Delhi (64).

Industry experts suggest that EIAs are an indicators of the state’s appetitie for growth.

The figures for 2019 are the highest for the state in the past six years and do not include EIAs submitted at state level.

“The increase in EIAs is definitely a good indicator of the state’s growth trajectory,” IT secretary Jayesh Ranjan told TOI.

He said that Pharma City, Image Towers and second phase of T-hub were among the 60 projects for which EIAs were submitted last year. “The EIAs are only a small representation of projects in the state. There is an independent committee that scrutinises these assessments at state-level,” said special chief secretary for environment, Rajeshwar Tiwari

Projects that require the Union ministry of environment and forests clearance are those whose physical infrastructure in terms of size and cost is greater than the levels defined in Category-A of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006 (EIA-2006).

These include projects in ports, highways, sanitation, urban transport as well as other industrial sectors.

All new national highways (NH) are classified as Category A. Expansion of NHs over 30 km, involving additional right of way over 20 metres, land acquisition and passing through more than one state also fall under Category-A.

According to NHAI sources, while there are several NH projects in the state, none required central clearance.

As per official records, 4,957 EIAs have been carried out by project proponents at central level since 2014.

Former vice-chancellor Sudhir Kumar Sopory (Photo: JNU website)

NEW DELHI: A day after unprecedented violence rocked JNU with masked goons running amok and beating up teachers and students , former vice-chancellor Sudhir Kumar Sopory said the Centre should intervene if the university administration was unable to resolve the festering issues.

“I felt like crying yesterday. JNU completed 50 years and the university should have been celebrating instead of such violence. It’s so unfortunate,” Sopory said, adding that the unrest in the university had been dragging on for too long now. Urging all stakeholders to let go their egos and have a dialogue, he said protests were a part of the JNU tradition but till not long ago, disputes were resolved through talks and discussion. “Things have come to such a pass because of the ego of the vice-chancellor and the students. This is not the first time that the protests are happening, but they never dragged on for so long without talks.”

Sopory felt that the recommendations of a committee set up by the ministry of human resource development asking for a dialogue with students and withdrawal of cases against them should have been implemented. “Ideally, the university should have resolved the issue. But after the government set up a committee, its recommendations should have been taken into consideration. The government needs to intervene and restore normalcy now,” he said.

On claims and counter-claims on the genesis of the violence, Sopory said: “The point is not who started the fight. Shutting off academic and administrative blocks for such a long time is not correct and the administration should have restored normalcy.”

CM Pinarayi Vijayan

KOZHIKODE: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said that there were some suspicions on the intentions of the Congress party on the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ).

Speaking at the conclusion of the youth march organized by DYFI raising the slogan ‘India will not surrender, we will not remain silent’ at the Kozhikode Beach on Monday, he said that the stand taken by KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran against holding joint agitations on the issue and the fact that chief ministers of Congress-ruled states except Punjab have not publically denounced CAA has raised some doubts.

“I had written to the chief ministers of some states who had taken stand against CAA after the Kerala Assembly unanimously passed a resolution against the Act asking them if they too can take steps to pass similar resolutions in their state assemblies. But I have not seen any Congress chief minister, expect the Punjab CM coming out in public denouncing the Act. Why is there a small hide-and-seek on the issue? Don’t fault us for some suspicions we are having while considering all these things. What is your real intention on the issue,” Vijayan said.

Condemning the attack against students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi on Sunday, Vijayan alleged that the attacks were carried out by criminals belonging to the RSS. “The police stayed away when the attackers came. The attackers didn't give the consideration that JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh was a woman,” the chief minister said. He said that what was of concern was that those in power in the Centre have not even come forward to condemn the brutal attack. “Now is the time for all secular minded people to come together and declare that the country will not accept the arrogance of the RSS,” he added.

The DYFI march which began from Tirur in Malappuram covered 54km to reach Kozhikode Beach.

Justice A Muhamed Mustaque also ordered that the employees of Muthoot Securities Ltd’s office at Kadavanthra should be given adequate police protection. The court also directed that protests should not be allowed within 50 metres of the Kadavanthra office.

The court’s directive came on pleas by the manager and employees of the main office and by employees of the Kadavanthra office. They had alleged that employees who are willing to work are being threatened and assaulted by those on strike.

The petitions also said that the protests being conducted against the alleged move to dismiss some employees and close down some branches have turned violent. The protests are being conducted by Non-banking and Private Finance Employees Association (CITU). The protestors are not allowing those willing to work to enter their offices and are assaulting them, the petitions had said while seeking police protection.

The petitioners had also alleged that even though there is an earlier order banning protests within 15m of the offices, the protestors are not obeying the order.

The court, in its order, also directed for making the chief secretary, home secretary, and the state police chief parties in the case.

The court also asked the petitioners why the management was not made a party in the petitions and directed to make them a party. The court asked for making the company management a party in the cases after labour department alleged that management’s representatives are not participating in labour discussions regarding the strike.

Madurai corporation has two sewage treatment plants at Vellaikkal and Sakkimangalam, where water is pumped through pumping stations located in various places in the city. While there are large-scale complaints that untreated water is being discharged from the pumping stations to the nearby water bodies, the commissioner warned against the activity at a meeting held at Anna Maaligai.

He also instructed engineering officials to identify the places where sewage water from residential areas enter river Vaigai. A detailed project report has to be prepared to address the issue and he also instructed them to levy fine from those who litter the river with garbage. He asked them to submit a report every day on the garbage processed at the micro composting yards.

Visakan also asked sanitation officials to visit toilets in the city and ensure they have 24 hours running water supply. Action has to be taken against contractors who are not maintaining the toilet clean. The commissioner also instructed officials to carry out inspections to effectively implement plastic ban.

Madurai: The Tamil Nadu Bovine Breeding Act will destroy the native breeds of jallikattu bulls in the name of enhancing milk production and this should not be implemented, said the Jallikattu training centre.

In a petition, the state secretary of the centre, P Ranjith, has said that the Act paves way for production of female calves and eliminates males. This will affect the breeding and propagation of the native breeds of bulls, which are used for the jallikattu.

As the Act has made it mandatory for the bull owners to get fitness certificates for bulls from veterinarians, it will restrict natural cross breeding between the native breeds. The Rs 50,000 fine will further affect the breeding of native breeds.

The Act should be suitably amended to promote native breeds also. As this was the jallikattu season, they had decided to bring it to the notice of the collector, he said.

Ranjith says that the government should hold consultations with all the organisations working with native breeds of cows before implementing the Act. Also, the online registration of jallikattu bulls, which cannot be done by all the game players, should be withdrawn, he said.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Delhi’s population is now higher than the population of countries like New Zealand, Greece, Sweden, Zimbabwe and the Netherlands. It has officially crossed two crore, according to the data released by the Election Commission of India, with the announcement of the upcoming assembly elections.

The officially estimated population of 2.01 crore in 2020 is more than the population of 140 countries/territories for which both population and area data is available, though Delhi’s area is tiny in comparison to many of them.

The largest country by area with fewer people than India’s capital is Kazakhstan. The country that is spread over 27 lakh square km has an estimated population of 1.88 crore. This means its population is 93.4% of Delhi’s, while its area is 1,819 times as large. Similarly Zimbabwe has 73.9% of Delhi’s population and is 261 times the area.

There are over 50 countries with higher populations than Delhi. Even among these, many have a slightly higher population but are over thousand times bigger in area. Canada for example has a population which is 1.9 times of Delhi and an area that is 6,128 times the size of India’s capital. Similarly, Australia is 5,183 times the size of Delhi with just 1.3 times its population. Argentina and Saudi Arabia are also over a thousand times Delhi’s size with only slightly higher population.

All of this is just the National Capital Territory. The population of the Delhi Urban Agglomeration (UA) — the continuous urban spread that includes Ghaziabad, Noida, Gurgaon and Faridabad — is by far the largest in the country. The UN estimates for Delhi UA’s population at three crore for 2020, a crore more than the Mumbai UA. Other UAs with population over a crore are Kolkata, Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad.

Delhi UA was the second fastest growing among these six. Between 2010 and 2020, Delhi UA saw a decadal population growth of 38% less only than Bangalore’s 49% in this period.

Delhi UA is also, after Tokyo, the world’s second largest continuous urban spread. Tokyo has an estimated 3.7 crore people living in the city and adjoining overgrowths. Shanghai, Sao Paulo, Dhaka, Cairo and Beijing are next on the list of the world’s biggest UAs. Among the 10 largest, Dhaka saw the fastest growth between 2010 and 2020 while Delhi came second on this count.

KOZHIKODE: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan , on Monday, said the government was planning to scrap internal marks for college students across the state in future.

Vijayan, who was taking part in the Chief Minister’s Student Leaders Conclave at Farook College , was responding to concerns raised by college union representatives about students being victimised in the name of internal marks. The event, aimed to engage student leaders and elicit their view in the state’s development, was attended by college union representatives from six universities and Kerala Kalamandalam ( deemed university ).

Vijayan, in his reply speech, said steps were being taken to ensure that students don’t fail because of poor performance in internals. “We are planning to do away with it (internal marks) in the future,” the chief minister said.

Later state higher education minister K T Jaleel told media that already the government had been able to partially put an end to victimisation of students in the name of internal marks by implementing a decision in Kerala Technological University (KTU) that there’s no need to have separate minimum marks for internal assessment. “We will make the decision applicable for other universities in the next academic year, he said.

Citing that protection of the Constitution was the need of the hour, the chief minister said steps would be taken to make reading of the Preamble of the Constitution in school assemblies mandatory.

Responding to a demand from students on the need to have 50% reservation for women in college unions, the chief minister said the demand was just and the government will give serious consideration to it as the proportion of women students in colleges was increasing.

He said steps would be taken to ensure that university libraries function round-the-clock. There would be no restrictions in library timings for girl students, he added.

Sadaf Jafar

LUCKNOW: Activist Sadaf Jafar and ex-IPS officer SR Darapuri will spend one more night in the jail because Legal formalities for their release could not be completed by Monday evening. They are expected to be released on Tuesday morning.

A local court had granted bail to them on Saturday. They were arrested on charges of instigating violence in Lucknow during anti-citizenship law protests on December 19.

The news of delay in release was broken by Sadaf’s sister Naheed Varma on her Facebook account. “Another day of wait…Sadaf Jafar and Darapuri ji get released tomorrow. The bail procedures take long!” (sic),” Naheed posted.

“Anxiously waiting for her release on Tuesday morning. A bit disappointed with a day’s delay. Had completed all the formalities by 4.30 pm but the person who takes the release order from court to jail had already left by that time because his working hours were over,” wrote Naheed.

Ved Darapuri, son of the ex-IPS officer, too, was disappointed. “The release will now take place on Tuesday, hopefully in the morning itself, because all our paperwork is now complete. Only release order has to be delivered to the jail,” Ved told TOI.

While Sadaf was arrested on December 19 from Parivartan Chowk in Lucknow while she was filming the violence and alerting police, Darapuri was placed under house arrest on December 19 but arrested the next day and booked for conspiracy.

There was nationwide uproar against their arrests.

117,['7/01/2020'],Hyderabad tops in bank frauds in south India,"This story is from January 7, 2020

HYDERABAD: In a dubious distinction, Hyderabad has topped in banking frauds in south India. Out of 11 major frauds reported in 2019, seven cases have its origins in Hyderabad. Bengaluru and Chennai have two such cases each, according to a CBI data.

The fraud amount crossed Rs 4,500 crore involving Hyderabad-based companies alone, Banking Securities and Fraud Cell (BSFC), a unit of CBI based in Bengaluru, said.

In many cases, bank officials were not named as accused. Also, 2019 saw an increase in banking frauds when compared to 2018, a fact confirmed by the Central Crime Station (CCS) sleuths.

Apart from this, two cases of banking frauds pertaining to Telangana have been registered with the Economic Offences Bureau (EOB) of CBI, Chennai, and 11 cases of frauds with ACB, Hyderabad.

In the latest case involving Transstroy (India) Ltd, a construction company owned by former TDP MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao, Rs 3,822 crore was diverted and Union Bank of India reported a loss of Rs 300 crore. The total NPA was Rs 8,500 crore, sleuths said.

According to CBI data, politician Vakati Narayana Reddy-owned VNR Infra duped banks of Rs 62 crore. The CBI-Bengaluru cell registered a case in July 2019 in this regard. In another case booked with CBI in the same month last year, Hyderabad-based Musaddilal Jewellers Exporters Private Ltd duped Indian Overseas Bank to the tune of Rs 75 crore.

Totem Infra duped IDBI of Rs 220 crore, while Union Bank of India was cheated by Minerva Executive Apartments of Rs 35 crore. Syndicate Bank suffered a loss of Rs 46 crore at the hands of South India Exim, while SBI suffered Rs 30-crore loss thanks to Quench Soft. PCH Corporation is accused of cheating banks of Rs 28 crore.

In cases booked with EOB-Chennai, BNR Infra was accused of causing a loss of Rs 8 crore to SBI. Sudhanshu Exim Pvt Ltd caused Rs 8.7 crore loss to the banks.

Anti-corruption activist M Padmanabha Reddy explained that no fraud can happen without active connivance of senior bank officials. “CBI should go after the bank officials and big corporates. In many cases, bankers are not even filing complaints against the companies,” he told TOI.

When contacted, CCS DCP Avinash Mohanty said banking frauds had seen a rise in 2019 when compared to 2018. “We have received several cases of banking frauds, with some running into several lakhs.

An accused dacoit Posa being taken to the court in Kanpur Dehat (left) and government counsel Rajiv Porwal

KANPUR: The specially-constituted dacoity affected area court of Kanpur Dehat is expected to pronounce verdict on January 18 on the massacre of 20 people in Behmai village, allegedly by bandit Phoolan Devi, nearly four decades ago.

The special court was expected to deliver the verdict in the 1981 Behmai massacre case on Monday. But it allowed the defence counsel to submit some citations of superior courts in favour of his clients by January 16. The court has now listed the case for January 18, when the judgment is expected on the role of the four arrested accused — Posa, Bhikha, Vishwanath and Ram Singh.

District government counsel (criminal) Rajiv Porwal told TOI, “On an application of defence counsel Girish Narain Dubey on previous date on December 19, the court had fixed January 6 for written arguments and delivery of judgment.”

“Dubey had urged before the court that he wanted to file some rulings and sought appropriate time, after which presiding officer Sudhir Kumar had fixed January 6 as submission of written argument and judgment order. But the defence counsel once again preferred an application today (January 6) and sought more time.”

“Allowing the application, the presiding judge asked the defence counsel to file citations by January 16 while the judgment would be delivered on January 18,” the district government counsel told TOI.

A large crowd of media persons was present in the Kanpur Dehat court premises to hear the verdict in the case, which had shocked the country on February 14, 1981. Phoolan Devi a.k.a. ‘Bandit Queen’, who later turned to politics, and her gang members were accused of killing 20 people belonging to the Thakur community at Behmai village under Sikandara police jurisdiction in Kanpur Dehat on February 14, 1981.

According to the case file, Phoolan with the help of four gangs of Ram Autar, Mustuqeem, Ramkesh and Lalloo had raided Behmai situated on the banks of river Yamuna to take revenge from Thakurs of the village and dacoit Lala Ram and Shri Ram, who had allegedly exploited her for several days in the village.

UP police had failed to arrest Phoolan after the massacre. She had later surrendered before the MP police and spent her jail period in Gwalior and Jabalpur jails.

Phoolan contested legal battle with UP police in Behmai case. She had challenged various orders passed by the Kanpur Dehat court but never appeared before the trial court in Kanpur Dehat. She was later elected as a member of Parliament on Samajwadi Party ticket. She was shot dead by one Sher Singh Rana in 2001 in New Delhi.

During the trial, besides Phoolan, other accused Ram Autar, Mustuqeem, Balram, Moti, Vrindavan, Ram Prakash, Rampal, Lallu Baghel, Balwan, Lallu Yadav, Ram Shankar, Jaggan, Prem, Nanda and Baladeen had died and cases against them abated.

The families of the victims were hopeful that justice, which has eluded them for the last 39 years after the carnage, would be delivered today but had to return disappointed.

Porwal said around two dozen villagers of Behmai were in court campus and several of them were in court when the hearing was going on in post-lunch session.

119,['7/01/2020'],BJP likely to announce new Kerala president by January 15,"This story is from January 7, 2020

BJP flag

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The BJP will announce its new state president by January 15. The process of identifying a candidate, most probably through consensus, is nearing completion.

BJP national spokesperson and central committee member GVL Narasimha Rao and BJP joint general secretary (organization) Shiv Prakash are expected to reach Kerala on Tuesday for the final round of discussions before the official announcement of the new state president of the party, a position that remained vacant after the appointment of former state president P S Sreedharan Pillai as Mizoram governor in October, 2019.

BJP state general secretaries K Surendran and M T Ramesh remain the frontrunners to the post, though a few other names, including that of party national executive member Sobha Surendran, are also doing the rounds. “An election to the post of state president is highly unlikely. There are more than one candidates, all from the state itself. But, as is to everybody’s knowledge, the central leadership reserves the right in choosing the ‘right’ candidate,” sources close to the developments said.

The leaders in Kerala appear more content this time around as the central leadership has at least stopped the practice of announcing the party chief without much consultations with the state leaders.

“If the opinion of RSS is decisive, chance rests with Ramesh than Surendran. But the preference of RSS state leadership is highly unlikely to influence the selection process this time and several key factors could work in favour of Surendran,” said a BJP leader.

Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan and BJP general secretary (organization) B L Santhosh, who dons the role of a main conduit between RSS and BJP, nationally, have already put their weight behind Surendran.

BJP former state president Kummanam Rajasekharan is likely to be asked to take over the organizational work at the national level. The list of new district presidents of the party would be ready by January 9.

BJP national secretary H Raja and BJP Karnataka president Nalin Kumar Kateel are among a group of national leaders with whom the party has entrusted the task of coordinating the election of district committee presidents.

District presidents have been finalized in Kasaragod, Kannur, Kozhikode and Wayanad in north Kerala and Thiruvananthapuram in south. Though efforts were on to evolve a consensus on candidates for key positions, the party is not averse to conducting elections in districts where more than one candidate stay put in the fray.

The party has set 55 years as upper age limit for state presidents. Though there is rumour that the upper age limit of state president would be 65, clarity is yet to descend on such matters.

Vadodara: A priest living in Wadi area was severely injured when a stray cow attacked him near his house on Sunday. The 68-year-old priest Dilip Rajgor registered a case against the owner of the cow on Monday.

According to Rajgor, when he was walking to a temple situated near Mandvi, a cow walked towards him. Rajgor moved towards the other side of the narrow street, but the cow too moved towards him and hit him with its horn. Rajgor fell on the road and a couple of women living there came to his rescue. The left side of his torso was badly injured and he began bleeding profusely.

Rajgor was taken to his home and his son rushed him to SSG Hopital for treatment. After treating his injury, doctors discharged Rajgor in the evening.

On Monday morning, Rajgor went to Wadi police station to lodge a complaint. He told police that the owner of the cow lets the bovine stray around due to which pedestrians’ and commuters’ lives are put at risk. Based on his complaint, cops registered an offence of attempt to culpable homicide against the unidentified cow rearer.

Lately, VMC has been going slow on impounding stray cattles. The menace had, however, reached alarming levels during monsoon. Even now the cow owners let their cattle loose on city roads late in the night and take them back in the early hours. Due to the presence of cows, the roads are littered with their droppings making them slippery for early morning commuters.

Porvorim: The Congress Legislature Party met on Monday at the Assembly complex where the five Congress MLAs decided to appoint Curtorim MLA Reginaldo Lo as the chief party whip. Opposition leader Digamabar Kamat made the announcement, and also said that the party had decided to question the state government’s financial policies.

“The financial condition of the state is bad. I have heard that schools have not got maintenance grants. Development grants for each constituency have not been released,” said Kamat.

Former chief minister Luizinho Faleiro said that for the last three years, the state government has failed to sanction the promised Rs 25 crores and Rs 5 crores for planned and unplanned development projects for each constituency. The decline in tourism, rise in drug trafficking and rising debt are other concerns that Congress plans to raise in the coming Assembly session. TNN

Representative image

MADURAI: As many as 80 people, including 21 women, were arrested by the police on Monday for trying to block the road at Avaniapuram in protest against the district collector’s order giving “secondary preference” to the traditional people in organizing the renowned jallikattu event there.

Tension prevailed in the region in the morning as police pickets were placed and announcements made through the public announcement system asking people to refrain from believing social media posts and attempting to gather unlawfully on the roads. However, many people came on to the streets around 11 am. Villagers say they have been conducting the sport for over a century till A K Kannan came in as organizer and renamed the organizing committee as Thenkal Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam. He formed an eight-member committee to conduct the game under its name which was opposed by the other villagers who wanted proper representation.

The villagers say there are complex rules in the village which say that only those who own cultivable land can be members of Thenkal Vivasayigal Sangam. However, they point out that there are traditional families which have been living in the village for years but do not own land now. They allege that Kannan is an outsider who has gained entrance into their village by buying land in Avaniapuram and is now trying to usurp their rights with political influence. He was close to the local ministers and MLA as they all belong to the same community.

K R Murugan, organizer of Veerakulam Amarar Iyakkam, claims there are 14 communities in Avaniapuram. But, instead of giving importance to the real leaders of each community in the organizing committee, Kannan was handpicking members from other communities to support his activities. He was also denying first rights to the village head, (nattamai).

Two peace committee meetings have so far been conducted by the district administration in this regard. It was decided on January 3 to name the organizing committee “Avaniapuram oor makkal vizha kuzhu”. However, the collector told them it would have to be called Avaniapuram Grama Pothu Makkal mattrum Thenkal Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam and that Kannan would be the president of the organizing committee. The villagers say the name Thenkal Vivasayigal sangam should not come in the name of the committee. Cases were registered under sections 143 and 341 of the IPC against the protesting public and they were released in the evening.

When contacted, district collector Dr T G Vinay said since Kannan has the experience of conducting the game after the court order, they had asked him to continue. However, he does not have any right to choose the other members like treasurer and secretary. The villagers were authorised to unanimously decide on their choice for these posts. The district administration would also monitor the funds, he said.

123,['7/01/2020'],Two youths beaten to death in powerloom unit,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Erode: Two labourers from Bihar working in a powerloom unit were found beaten to death in the room they were staying in Erode district on Monday.

Police have arrested another Bihari youth on suspicion for the murders. Police suspect that three were peddling ganja and a dispute over sharing of money resulted in a fatal attack.

Police identified the deceased as L Navin Kumar, 25 and S Sukendra Kumar, 28. According to police, the deceased along with Ravindra Kumar, also hailing from Bihar, were working in the powerloom unit owned by Ramesh of Kavundhapadi in Erode. The three were staying in a room on the powerloom unit premises.

Preliminary investigations revealed that the three had consumed liquor on Sunday night when a quarrel erupted between them. In a fit of rage, Ravindra Kumar assaulted Navin and Sukendra with steel rod used in the unit.

The two collapsed in a pool of blood and died on the spot.

Ramesh, who came to the powerloom unit in the morning, saw the two lying on the floor dead and informed police, who reached the spot. A sniffer dog was also brought to the spot. Since Ravindra Kumar was the only other person who was at the unit along with the victims, police interrogated him, during which he spilled the beans.

Inquiries also revealed that the three were selling ganja in the locality and used to share the returns. Quarrels were frequent among the three over sharing of cash and one such quarrel broke out on Sunday night too which resulted in the double murder.

Police however are continuing the probe to find if anyone else was involved in the illegal ganja sale and the clash.

124,['7/01/2020'],"In a first, IISER completes genome sequencing of wild tiger","This story is from January 7, 2020

Bhopal: For the first time, the genome sequencing of a wild tiger has been completed in the country. An IISER-Bhopal team has completed genome and transcriptome sequencing and analysis of a wild tiger for the first time in the country. Sequencing was done from the sample of a man-eater tiger, Bandhu, who was brought at Van Vihar two years ago. Genome sequencing is a way to figure out the order of DNA nucleotides, or bases, in a genome.

Their study was also recently published in international journal 'Nature Scientific Reports 2019'. The associate professor, department of biological sciences, Vineet K. Sharma, said the genomic studies on this highly endangered species are much needed since its population has rapidly declined in the past due to human interventions.

He said that tiger is the largest feild species and has diverse morphological and behavioural adaptations required for its survival and predation. “To study the genetic basis of such adaptations in tiger, our group generated the first genomic sequence of an Indian tiger,” said Sharma. “As we have done it now, further studies will be possible within country itself,” he added.

“An understanding of the genetic basis of its phenotypic adaptations may help in designing more effective strategies for conservation and breeding of tiger,,” said associate professor, Sharma. Other members of the team were Parul Mittal, Shubham K Jaiswal, Nagarjun Vijay and Rituja Saxena.

Sharma claimed that they have even found the correct genome sequencing in their study. “The tiger genome had been sequenced earlier by a Chinese group, but we noted that the genome assembly (PanTig1.0) consisted of several erroneous nucleotide substitutions, and thus it was giving wrong information. We have now corrected the study,” said Sharma.

He added that usage of the earlier assembly led to several incorrect results in previous studies. “We developed an assembly error correction tool ‘SeqBug’, and corrected almost one million bases in the tiger genome assembly, which map to 4,472 genes,” said Sharma.

The team deciphered the genetic basis of the evolution of tiger's lineage using the corrected genome which were further validated by the re-sequenced genome and transcriptome of the tiger.

Aurangabad: In an eco-friendly measure, Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada (SRTM) University, Nanded, has started a ‘no vehicle day’ on its campus.

It is also mandatory for all to comply with the rules and those failing to do so will have to pay a fine of Rs 200.

Ashok Kadam, public relations officer of SRTM University said the initiative was a part of ‘clean & green’ campus movement launched by the university.

“The campaign is the brainchild of Vice-Chancellor Udhav Bhosle. We have appealed to all students, teachers, non-teaching staff and visitors to support the initiative. It is a small step towards making the entire campus an eco-friendly one,” he said.

The ‘no vehicle day’ has also been made mandatory for university sub-centres at Latur and Parbhani along with the university-managed degree college at Hingoli.

The maiden ‘no vehicle day’ observed at SRTM and other identified institutions recently witnessed 100% response, authorities said.

The visitors with the vehicles were asked to park their vehicles outside the campus.

“Youth have more receptive minds and it is an ideal age to inculcate the importance of the environment in them. The ‘clean & green’ campus movement aims to shape the minds of students in such a way that they would be aware of existing and future challenges related to the ecological balance,” Kadam said.

“Taking a cue from the university’s initiative, we hope that the affiliated colleges also observe ‘no vehicle day’, which aims to bring down the noise and air pollution,” university authorities said.

Vadodara: Hailing from nondescript villages in the tribal heartland of Gujarat, these two differently abled girls are eyeing to wield the willow and swing the cherry like any other man or woman who steps on the cricket ground. The two girls are among those who made the cut for the first camp for selection of girls for the first national disabled women’s cricket team.

The camp was organized in November and the two girls from Dahod were among the 31 women picked up for further training. The efforts for a disabled women’s cricket team for the country have been taken up by Divyang Cricket Control Board of India (DCCBI).

The two girls selected from Dahod had no previous experience of playing cricket and belong to remote villages where girls hardly play the game. It was their teacher at an Industrial Training Institute (ITI) in Ahmedabad who guided them to the camp organized by director (cricket operations) of DCCBI, Nitendra Singh.

Geeta Damor, who had completed her ITI course in computers and was working at a unit in Sanand, decided to give up her job to ensure that she could attend training sessions regularly. “I was not getting much at the job and was keen to play cricket and hence decided to attend the camp,” she said. Geeta’s father works as a mason and her mother takes up labour work when she is not busy with household work.

Like Geeta, Lalita Damor too was a student of the ITI, but had quit her beautician’s course. She had lost her father in 2007 and it was her mother who was bringing her up. The family was dependent on agriculture. Lalita has a disability in her left leg due to polio and has to use a stick. “I am interested in cricket and would like to continue playing,” she said.

Geeta, Lalita and others come to Vadodara every weekend for practice after the camp ended last month. They had interest in sports earlier too and a teacher at their ITI had directed them to Singh for cricket coaching.

Geeta (25) is from Pukda village of Fatehpura taluka and Lalita (23) hails from Dumka village of Dhanpura taluka in Dahod.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday condoled the death of former governor of the state Triloki Nath Chaturvedi. In his condolence message, the chief minister said as a governor and the comptroller and auditor general of the country, Chaturvedi did an exemplary service.

Ninety-year-old Chaturvedi, who was the governor of Karnataka, held the additional post of governor of the state for a brief period of four months. He was handed over the charge after the sudden demise of the then governor Sikader Bhakt. He handed over the post to R L Bhatia after holding the post from February 25, 2004 to June 23, 2004, a transition period from the first NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee to first UPA government led by Manmohan Singh.

Chaturvedi was the CAG from 1984 to 1989 and was the governor of Karnataka from 2002 to 2007. He also held several key posts after demitting the office of governor in 2007. As an IAS officer, he had held the posts of chief secretary of Delhi administration, chief commissioner of Chandigarh, director of Indian Institute of Public Administration, secretary of ministries including education, culture and sports and home affairs.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The 24-hour all-India strike called by 10 major trade unions, including CITU and INTUC, is all set to paralyze normal life in the state from Tuesday midnight. The joint action council, which comprises major trade unions except BMS which is affiliated to the BJP, told reporters on Monday that they expected a ‘joint strike’ the state or the country has never witnessed before.

Unlike during the previous occasions, the sentiments against the anti-people policies of the central government is much strong and widespread, union leaders said, adding that they expected even BMS, ‘which has not yet announced support or opposition’, to extend moral support. Vehicles, including private ones, will keep off the roads, while all trade and commercial establishments and shops will remain closed, they said.

The general strike has exempted tourism sector and vehicles carrying Sabarimala pilgrims, besides essential services like hospital, milk and newspaper. “The tourism sector has been raising this demand – to exempt the sector from hartals and strikes – and we have taken a favourable decision, especially in case of foreign tourists who are on packaged tours,” said MP Elamaram Kareem, who is CITU state general secretary.

Joining the strike will be Centre/state employees, those in banking and insurance sectors and BSNL employees besides farmers, who have called for a ‘grameena (rural) hartal’ on Wednesday.

“The strike, which is mainly against the anti-labour policies of the NDA government and privatization of PSUs, will also inspire to strengthen the ongoing and widespread agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. We make an appeal to people working in both organized and unorganized sectors, including those working in the IT sector and in shopping malls, to join the protest and strike work on Wednesday,” Kareem said.

Trade unions are demanding a hike in the minimum wage of workers to Rs 21,000, a minimum pension of Rs 10,000 for all workers, skip plans to privatize PSUs, back out from amending labour laws to favour employers, prevent price rise, strengthen public distribution system, ensure farmers a fair price for their products, waive off their debts, solve unemployment issues and prevent the spread of communalism.

Leaders also said that the strike will have a greater impact in states like West Bengal, Maharashtra , Bihar and Chhattisgarh . AISBIEA general secretary K S Krishna , in a statement, said, “Banking sector issues like burgeoning bad loans and their write-off, unwarranted bank mergers, diminishing interest rates and returns for depositors and staff shortage will be in focus”.

The Reserve Bank employees will also join the strike.

129,['7/01/2020'],"Cops should immediately stop violence, restore peace: Delhi CM","This story is from January 7, 2020

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Politicians across party lines have condemned the attacks on the students and teachers of Jawaharlal Nehru University on Sunday night.

Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal held a meeting with senior party functionaries at his residence to discuss the situation. “A woman professor was attacked and women students were subjected to violence. AAP is concerned. The Centre must immediately intervene and restore peace,” AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said. “Delhi is the capital of the country and it should remain peaceful. Such incidents of violence send out a bad image of the country,” Singh said. The pictures speak volume about the nature of violence, he added.

CM Kejriwal requested LG Anil Baijal to act. “I am so shocked to know about the violence at JNU . Students attacked brutally. Police should immediately stop violence and restore peace. How will the country progress if our students will not be safe inside univ campus?,” Kejriwal asked on Twitter after the attack.

Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra said that Union home minister Amit Shah should own up moral responsibility for the attack on students by goons and tender his resignation. People of Delhi were now living in fear, he added.

Union minister Prakash Javadekar blamed Congress, AAP and Left parties for violence. “Some elements along with a group from the Congress, the AAP and the Communists knowingly want to create an atmosphere of violence across the country and especially in universities,” he stated on Twitter seeking inquiry.

131,['7/01/2020'],"From Selection Of Site To Species, Plan Was Unscientific: Experts","This story is from January 7, 2020

Nagpur: An expert firm, a well-protected site and lessons from the past weren’t enough to resuscitate over a dozen mature trees that were uprooted for transplantation by MahaMetro.

In a hat-trick of disasters for the agency’s transplantation efforts, around 16 trees dug out from different birth places and replanted at a part of Ambazari reserve forest in Wadi look as dead as a doornail. Once-upon-a-time green and growing, today they are leafless and withered.

On entering the forest from the gate near Kachimet, Amravati Road, one is welcomed by a graveyard of trees, which looks similar to MahaMetro’s previous transplantation site at Patwardhan high school premises in Sitabuldi.

On receiving a tip-off about the failed transplantation, TOI first visited the spot on December 28 with honorary wildlife warden of Nagpur Jaydeep Das. Just like the relocated trees at Sitabuldi, the ones here stood barren, with no indications of regrowth of branches or leaves. The trunks were dried-up, with bark of many trees peeling off.

The first fault that Das pointed out was the site selection. “This part of Ambazari forest is grassland. Transplanting or even planting trees in this land type will damage the biodiversity of grassland habitat. Not only will the trees struggle to survive, the species of various birds and animals found in grassland will get adversely affected,” he said.

While experts suggest transplantation of only ficus species, exotic trees have also been transplanted. Pointing to an Ashoka tree, Das raised questions on the selection of tree species for the process. “The trees have also been transplanted right under a huge canopy of existing trees to camouflage the absence of leaf growth,” he alleged.

This is the third time that MahaMetro’s transplantation efforts have failed. Earlier, around 15 trees transplanted at a residential society in Mihan and 21 transplanted at the school premises could not survive. When TOI started digging out details of the botched up transplantations, this reporter received several polite requests not to publish the report.

In an official statement to TOI, MahaMetro stated that the transplanted trees were uprooted from different locations like Kadbi Square, Kamptee Road, Ambedkar Square and Central Avenue. “Overall, 16 trees were removed from their locations and transplanted at the site,” it added.

Further informing that the trees belong to different species like mango, drumstick, Ashoka, kadu-neem, umbar etc, the agency’s statement stressed that the all trees have shown signs of survival. “In case of transplantation, the growth of trees is slow and we expect them to grow more in the coming days. The fact that the bark of some trees is still green is an indication of their growth,” it stated.

While transplanting trees in Sitabuldi, Metro spent nearly Rs10 lakh of public money. “This time, we have not released any payment yet. As per our agreement, we will only pay the agency if the trees survive,” he said.

According to the spokesperson, MahaMetro has now given the transplantation work to a Hyderabad-based expert agency which has also conducted similar work in Pune.

To reaffirm the survival rate of trees, TOI revisited the spot with a transplantation expert who wished to remain anonymous. On checking the conditions of the bark, the expert concluded that almost all trees were dead and the transplantation process has failed. He peeled off the bark to show that there was no moisture or any signs of life in the trees.

As per MahaMetro, the trees were relocated during August last year. “If they had to re-grow, it would have happened latest by October. Despite various spells of rain, they didn’t regrow,” the expert said.

Apart from him, members of Green Vigil Foundation also accompanied TOI to the site. After inspecting the condition of all the transplanted trees, the group noted that the survival rate was abysmally low. “The process has gone miserably wrong. Huge trees have been planted at a distance of hardly 5-6 feet. How will they grow? It’s the same scene that we saw in Patwardhan ground in Sitabuldi where most of the trees have dried up,” said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil.

While MahaMetro had stated that five trees have developed new foliage, all the experts disagreed. “In one or two tree, few leaves are growing at the bottom of the trunk. But most likely, they won’t survive as the upper trunk is completely dead,” said Chatterjee.

Environment activist Shrikant Deshpande, who also inspected the spot, agreed that the transplantation process had failed. “Many trees died because they were species which can’t be transplanted,” he said.

After validation from experts, the final official authentication came from the civic body. In the third and final visit to the spot on January 3, a team of officials from Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s garden department carried out a spot inspection. According to them, only pipal, banyan, umbar, drumstick and chaafa species can be transplanted.

Though officials appreciated MahaMetro’s efforts for taking up the process, they agreed that the survival rate was zero.

132,['7/01/2020'],PWD moots diaphragm wall to halt Shanghumugham erosion,"This story is from January 7, 2020

restoration path: PWD received administrative sanction to revive Shanghumugham beach road at a cost of Rs 4.29... Read More

Thiruvananthapuram: Shanghumugham beach is at the mercy of the sea, which takes large chunks off it especially during the monsoon season. Now, the public works department has decided to fight back — experimenting with the diaphragm wall.

And when the PWD recently received administrative sanction to revive the stretch, at a cost of Rs 4.29 crore, it decided to tap the expertise of the Central Road Research Institute, which provided the design for the diaphragm wall, which can sustain high-intensity waves. To prevent scouring of the soil, an armour unit, mostly consisting of interlocked stone units of 120kg each, will be positioned in front of the wall, which will be 260m long, 0.50m wide and 8m high.

It is too early to cite a date for commencement of work, sources said, adding that the PWD will set up a technical team to review progress.

The diaphragm wall is a kind of retaining wall which can resist lateral pressure from soil or water. It is commonly used for construction of train subways. The wall is expected to have an inclination of 15 degrees.

The department had first invited tenders for the project in March 2019. However, it had to cancel the process as the election model code of conduct was in effect. It re-initiated the exercise last week. The office of the superintending engineer will open the documents on January 20. The chief minister’s distress relief fund will cough up the Rs 4.29 crore project cost.

In addition to construction of the wall, the PWD will renovate the beach road, which is currently in a dilapidated condition. Though a vast portion of the beach is damaged, people still throng the area, ignoring warnings. The contractor will have to dismantle existing concrete structures, the damaged Gabion wall and parts of the pavement for the work.

Madurai: A sub-inspector of police and a few unnamed policemen attached to the SS Colony police station were booked on Sunday on charges of injuring a juvenile offender during interrogation.

A five-member gang consisting of minors robbed a mobile phone and petty cash from Syed Hussain, 24, a data entry operator near Ellis Nagar Bridge late on December 18. Based on a complaint from Hussain from Pasumpon Nagar near Palanganatham, a case was registered under Section 395 of IPC (punishment for dacoity). The SS Colony police began a search and arrested a few people, including a juvenile.

When the police produced the juvenile to the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) a few days after the incident so that he can be lodged in observation home in the city, the boy told the board about the torture that he underwent in the police station. He told the board that a police officer with two stars on his shoulder kicked him with his boots. A few more policemen in the station also joined and attacked him causing injuries. He was also beaten on his wrists using lathis.

While the boy was sent for medical treatment, based on a petition an internal inquiry was carried out on orders from the assistant commissioner of police Thilagar Thidal.

Meanwhile, an FIR was registered under IPC Section 323 – punishment for voluntarily causing hurt and Juvenile Justice (care and protection of children) Act, 2015 on a complaint from V Karthick, an assistant-cum-computer operator with the JJ Board.

Police officers said the name of the police sub-inspector or policemen have not been mentioned in the FIR.

A juvenile had died in hospital after developing complication in an alleged custodial torture in SS Colony police station in January last year. He was taken to the police station for theft-related inquiry.

134,['7/01/2020'],LUSU polls: TOI social media followers divided,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Lucknow: The high court’s decision to pave way for the Lucknow University Students’ Union (LUSU) elections has kept social media users busy of-late. After TOI reported a vertical split among LU students on LUSU polls on the campus after a gap of 15 years, reactions from people of the city flooded TOI’s social media handles. While many hailed the move saying that elections would be a good beginning for budding leaders, a few others stated that it would increase lawlessness on the campus.

Giving examples of social activists Kanhaiya Kumar and Shehla Rashid of JNU, Siddique Khan, a professor and former LU student, welcomed the move. “Student politics is an integral part of mainstream politics. If we have people like Kanhaiya and Shehla, it is only because of such opportunities,” said Khan.

Another Twitter user @vasvi1995 stated that conducting elections in universities can help young scions understand constitutional ideologies. “These elections help students know about the problems and loopholes in their education system and other issues related to students. Conducting elections in LU will be a good start for budding leaders,” said Vasvi Verma, adding that if students are considered to be the future of the nation, they should get a chance to serve in various fields, even politics and governance.

While a few supported the revival of elections, some social media users seemed to be against the LUSU polls owing to the past history of violence on the campus. An Instagram user posted that due to past instances where unions aligning with political parties resorted to violence on the campus, the elections should not be revived to save LU’s academic essence.

Saheba Ramzi Khan, an Instagram follower, said the definition of politics needs to be changed. “Politics has been majorly confused with bribery and gunda-gardi. It will be good to see well-groomed and educated politicians on the campus, but lawlessness should definitely be controlled.”

Coimbatore: The rural police have formed a special team to nab a woman and four youths for recording private moments of a man with the woman and blackmailing him. The gang demanded Rs 25 lakh from the man and threatened him that they would release the video on social media if he refused to pay.

A police source said a businessman from RS Puram received a missed call two weeks ago. “When he called back the number, a woman attended the phone and told him that she wrongly dialed his number. However, she lured him by saying that she liked his voice. They started to chat and in three days, she invited him to her house near Anaimalai in Pollachi,” the source said.

“When the man went there, she left the door open to let the youths enter the house and record intimate moments between them. When the youths confronted him and snatched his mobile phones, gold chain and a ring as well as his car key, he came to know that the woman was part of the gang,” the source said.

A few days later, the gang demanded Rs 25 lakh from him. “They threatened to release the video in WhatsApp and other social media websites,” the source said. The man lodged a complaint with superintendent of police Sujit Kumar. Police said the woman was the mastermind behind the whole episode.

Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala state commission for protection of child rights registered a suo-moto case against drug and narcotic peddlers whose presence in the precincts of schools in the state.

The commission chairman registered the case in view of various news reports in this regard.

“Sale of narcotics to children can attract jail term up to seven years as per the Child Rights Act . But, excise department is yet to get the nod for slapping this Act on those who peddle drugs to school children. Experience is such that people booked under feeble acts get out within hours after making payments of paltry sums as fine. It’s to firm up action against the drug and narcotic peddlers that commission intends to intervene,” a statement from the commission said here on Monday.

If police really cooperate with the drive against those who sell narcotic substance and drugs to children, culprits can be bundled into jails. Citing a rare instance, the commission pointed out the arrest and remand of persons who were hauled by excise officials in Kannur recently after they were caught red-handed with contrabands weighing 273kg stocked for sales among school children. Since the excise department officials were not given permission to use the laws effectively, culprits escape after paying a penalty of Rs 200, the statement said.

The commission asked chief secretary, state police chief, excise commissioner, general education director, LSGI director to file reports within two weeks on how they plan to implement the ban on sale of drugs and narcotics in the vicinity of schools.

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh STF has registered four more FIRs related to Vyapam scam cases. This is in addition to the six FIRs that were registered by the STF in the scam during the last fortnight.

Fresh cases have been registered for impersonation in police constable recruitment scam, and submission of fake documents in medical entrance examination. With these four fresh cases, the agency has registered 10 cases so far.

ADG STF Ashok Awasthi told media that 197 old complaints were examined after which four candidates and their supporters were booked.

One of the accused has been identified as Bijendra Rawat. He had appeared for police constable exam in 2013. Investigations revealed mismatch in his signature and those found in the OMR sheet. Rawat is currently posted in Gwalior. ADG said that Rawat was impersonated in the entrance exam and therefore the signature mismatch has been detected.

Probe also revealed that three candidates had submitted forged domicile in the PMT 2009 and 2010 respectively. They were selected. The accused booked are Saurabh Sachan, Benezir Shah Farooqi and Vipin Kumar Singh. They had submitted forged domiciles of Rewa and Sidhi districts. They have completed their MBBS and their current posting is being inquired.

STF had initiated a probe into the 1,200 pending Vyapam complaints that haven’t been taken up by the CBI. Gwalior-based Ashish Chaturvedi and Indore-based Dr Anand Rai were summoned by the agency with documents related to around 150 complaints regarding ‘Vyapam scam’ that they had filed with the agency in the last four to five years.

CBI had taken over 180 of the 251 Vyapam cases from the STF after the Supreme Court handed over the probe to it in July 2015. At that time, STF had around 1,200 more complaints pending and they were all pushed to the backburner.

Nearly 3,000 people, including a state cabinet minister, MLAs and several high-ranking officials were booked or arrested by the STF in connection with the scam by the time CBI took over. Only a few cases are left where the central agency is yet to file charge-sheets.

KOCHI: SmartCity project has given a push to the solar energy projects in the city. Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) has set up solar plants on the rooftops of 28 institutions in the city, thereby generating 1,000 kilowatts of energy.

Though CSML identified more than 60 institutions for setting up rooftop solar plants in the city, they could set up the plants at 28 institutions only.

“Most of the firms we identified were later proven to be not suitable for the project. Now, we have completed the works at 28 institutions,” an official with CSML said.

Presently, CSML authorities are carrying out the procedures to connect the plants at these firms to KSEB’s grid. “We have already connected the plants at six institutions, including Ernakulam General Hospital, with KSEB’s grid. Now, we are in the process of securing grid connectivity to other plants also,” the official said.

CSML has already earmarked Rs 10 crore for a public bicycle sharing project. As part of the project, they have procured 160 bicycles and set up 16 docking yards attached to the Metro stations in different parts of the city.

According to CSML, the green initiative will cut down the fuel consumption as well as pollution caused by fossil fuels.

“We are awaiting approvals from Kochi municipal corporation, Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA), Goshree Islands Development Authority (Gida), Kalamassery municipality and railways for opening docks at 34 more stations,” a CSML official said.

The victory bell, made from the metal of a German warplane shot down over Britain during World War II holds a special place in the collection. She also has bells made from ceramic, metal, clay, porcelain, resin, amber stone, enamel, wedgewood, and cloisonne bells bought from over 90 countries, including the United States, Austria, China, Kenya, Latvia, Mexico, Japan, Italy and Croatia.

Her Indian collection includes brass and metal bells from Thanjavoor, Thiruvananthapuram, Jew Street in Kochi and the aramani (huge and heavy waist belt studded with bells) worn by velichappadu oracles in temples.

“I once went in search of bells in the UK based on information about a collection with a lady at Sevenoaks in Kent. I source around a hundred bells from every visit abroad. The whole house was earlier decorated with bells. I do not remember when it became a passion. It was only recently that I catalogued all the bells and got an enclosure where my collection is now displayed,” Latha said.

It was to support her passion that her husband N Mahesh built the enclosure. The structure is made of wood from a Canadian rainforest.

“I am the resource and Latha is the passion behind the museum. The idea was to make a lightweight structure, so we used timber,” said Mahesh.

A huge bell hanging near the glass ceiling is the most expensive piece here. The bell made of panchaloha (five metals) was bought from the bell metal town of Mannar for Rs 1.5 lakh.

Also displayed are wind chimes, Tibetan bowls and yak bells made of wood, which produce distinct sounds. Bells displaying Disney characters, US first ladies, birds, animals, bells for each month, Russian doll-shaped bells, prayer bells of Nepalese monks and a pewter bell with a handle engraving Jesus and his apostles add variety to the collection.

And Latha says she is far from done. She wishes to add a bell made from material used to fashion the Aranmula kannadi, which was suggested by a friend ... a real ‘bell’wether!

Madurai: A doctor at Ramanathapuram Government Hospital has been placed under suspension after a probe by a special team into the death of a pregnant woman and her foetus at the hospital during delivery.

On December 29, 23-year-old pregnant woman Keerthika and her foetus died due to a fatal allergic reaction that developed when she was administered a drug to induce labour pain at the hospital. Later, the angry kin of Keerthika had protested outside the hospital alleging medical negligence by doctors and an inquiry was initiated. A state team reporting directly to Tamil Nadu health secretary Dr Beela Rajesh, comprising a paediatrician, gynaecologist and an anaesthetist, conducted an inquiry into the incident at the hospital till the late hours on December 30. On December 31 at 6 pm, a suspension order was issued to Dr Manimozhi, who had attended to the patient. “Though medical negligence has not been established as the reason for the suspension, the doctor still has to take some responsibility because the case has resulted in deaths. Investigation revealed that the doctor was not present during the procedure for 10 minutes,” said a source from the health department.

While the health department sources said that the allergic reaction was not the only reason for the death of the woman and the foetus, sources from the Ramanathapuram GH maintained that the best possible treatment was given to the patient.

Madurai: Around 40 women students from a city college performed flash mobs on Monday at two major public spots in the city to create awareness about road safety and wearing helmets.

Students from Fatima College’s Department of Journalism and Mass Communication performed flash mobs at Goripalayam junction and outside Madurai Railway Station, carrying the message of wearing helmets and staying safe on roads. “The inspiration for coming up with such an activity started within the college. We noticed that many students didn’t wear helmets properly or they used to wear them only on seeing the police. It is sad to see that many of us, even after being aware of safety rules tend to ignore it. So, we did a program to make students understand the importance of road safety. Then, we had the thought of taking the message directly to the public through such an activity,” said Dr Saira Banu S, Assistant Professor, Department of Journalism and Mass Communication, Fatima College.

The performances of the students reminded the public about safe practices to be followed while on road. The need for people on two-wheelers including the pillion riders to wear helmets, the necessity for wearing seat belts and following road safety rules. Dr Saira Banu further said that the students received full support of the local police, including district Commissioner of Police, S Davidson Desirvatham. “The police stressed on the need for such awareness events. Our journalism students not only benefited from organizing the flash mob but also by covering it as budding reporters, talking to the public and police about road safety in the city,” she said.

AGRA: Following violence unleashed by masked goons at JNU on Sunday, students associated with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ( ABVP ) and National Students Union of India (NSUI) staged protest against each other at the Paliwal Park campus of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University on Monday afternoon.

Student leaders of both the organizations made allegations against each other for the violence in JNU.

Both sides indulged in high-pitch sloganeering against each other for over half an hour. Some of the protesters misbehaved with the varsity’s chief proctor and security guards. Later, the protesters dispersed after senior police officials intervened.

Agra university chief proctor Manoj Srivastava said, “ABVP had sought permission to hand over a memorandum to the university administration over the issue of violence in JNU. However, some of the students carried placards and started raising slogans outside the office of registrar. NSUI leaders along with a few Samajwadi Chatra Sabha workers, who were already on the campus, gathered on the spot to counter ABVP. We asked them to peacefully provide memorandum, but they continued to raise slogans. This led a situation of confrontation. We had to call the police to maintain peace on campus.”

Earlier on Monday, ABVP activists burnt an effigy of “Communists” outside Agra College.

ABVP spokesperson Shivam Jain said, “Communists are trying to control the educational institutions. We will not allow this to happen. In the memorandum handed over to registrar KN Singh, we have demanded complete ban on the Left-wing activities to ensure uninterrupted teaching and learning activities.”

NSUI district president Vilal Ahmed said, “ABVP is trying to create disturbance on the campus. In Agra university, they did not protest on any genuine issue concerning the students in the last two years.”

Superintendent of police (city) Botre Rohan Pramod told TOI, “We interacted with the student leaders staging protest on the varsity campus and asked to them to address their issues to the university administration. Based on the information provided by the university administration and other evidence, action will be taken against those who tried to create disturbance. Student leaders have been warned not to organize any gathering or stage protest as CrPC section 144 remains in force.”

Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority ( KCZMA ) has found itself stuck in the middle of a tussle between officials of the inland navigation department over alleged violations pertaining to construction of a shopping mall in Akkulam.

An executive engineer with the department’s Kollam office had brought to the attention of KCZMA encroachments that were noticed in the area where construction work on the proposed complex was progressing. The official also raised the issue of the property’s boundary wall encroaching on the Parvathi Puthannaar canal area and construction waste being dumped into the water body, and sought information on the CRZ categorization of the canal that runs from Kovalam to Akkulam.

Following this, KCZMA received a letter from the chief engineer of inland navigation & Kuttanad package in October 2019 which confounded the findings of the executive engineer. Questioning the executive engineer’s findings, the chief engineer said an inspection of the canal area in October 2019 did not reveal any dumping of waste material.

He recalled the report of the tahsildar which said the disputed property was not owned by the project’s developer and that it was in the name of other parties. The chief engineer added that the executive engineer intended to mislead the government and its agencies.

The KCZMA, at its 105th meeting, noted the chief engineer’s request that it need not consider the erroneous report furnished by the executive engineer. The matter was raised at the meeting as an out-of-agenda item. The authority had to decide whether a site inspection was called for.

It is learned that KCZMA deliberated on the matter and concluded that as a case is pending in the high court it will not take a call on site inspection, unless specifically directed by the court. “Besides, KCZMA had earlier reported that the project was outside CRZ limits and if court directs KCZMA to revise its decision, a site inspection may be necessitated. Otherwise, the matter has to be settled by the inland navigation department itself,’’ said an official.

The State Environment Impact Assessment Authority had earlier cleared the mall project of any violations of environmental clearance (EC) norms. The authority concluded that the land in possession of the project’s proponent does not include any puramboke (government) land and that this was verified by viewing Google Earth data of various periods. An examination of land records and conditions of EC to detect any violations was initiated by the authority in the wake of a petition filed in the high court in July saying that EC was granted in violation of norms.

Lucknow: In a sudden twist, district administration on Monday evening deferred Lucknow Mahotsava till further orders citing ‘unavoidable reasons’, just hours after holding a press conference to announce the events of the popular cultural fest which was scheduled from January 17-23.

District magistrate Abhishek Prakash said the decision to defer mahotsava was taken in a meeting of senior district officials in the evening. He, however, did not cite any specific reason. Other administrative officers said the postponement was done in the wake of security reasons and preparations for the upcoming Defence Expo in the city.

The 10-day Lucknow Mahotsava is held every year from November 25 and showcases food, culture and heritage of the city. Its another attraction are the entertainment programmes. But, it was deferred last November in the wake of Ayodhya verdict by the Supreme court.

All preparations for mahotsava are complete. In fact, DM held a curtain raiser press conference along with divisional commissioner Mukesh Meshram on Monday afternoon announcing that the venue would be Ramabai Ambedkar Maidan, though mahotsava would be formally inaugurated at the Residency.

Even names of celebrity performers, along with schedule of indoor and outdoor programmes, at the extravaganza were also released.

Divisional commissioner Meshram, who is also head of the Mahotsav committee, said the inaugural event will coincide with the re-launch of light and sound show at the Residency, depicting the history and culture of Lucknow.

However, the decision of postponement of Mahotsava was announced in a single line press note released on Monday evening.

Dehradun: Migrant Hindus from Pakistan living in Dehradun — there are around 200 of them — condemned the killing of a Sikh man in Pakistan, saying the incident was an indictment of persecution of Sikhs and Hindus in the country.

Jeet Chandhok, a Hindu migrant who runs a sanitary hardware shop in Dehradun, said, “Hindu families face discrimination and persecution every day in Pakistan. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will prove to be a boon for migrant Hindu families. However, the government must make sure that Pakistan residents get easy visa clearances.” The Hindu migrants in India are living on extended visas but can be eligible for citizenship once CAA comes into effect.

Ishwar Lal, who used to run a chemist’s shop in Battagram, Pakistan before migrating to Dehradun and becoming an auto-rickshaw driver, said, “Persecution of Hindus goes on unabated in Pakistan and no one intervenes. The Sikh boy belonged to the family of a famous doctor. If he was targeted, can you imagine the fate of less fortunate members of minority communities in Pakistan?” Lal added.

NEW DELHI: Visitors to the Krishna Nagar market were pleasantly surprised on Monday, to see the beautification work on Lal Quarter stretch with demarcation by yellow lines for pedestrians, flower pots, benches and fancy lights installed at regular intervals.

As part of the pedestrianisation and parking management plan for Krishna Nagar, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation has restricted vehicle movement on the 1.5km Lal Quarter stretch. When TOI visited the place on Monday, there was no unauthorised parking on roads or hawkers on pavements. This made shopping even more fun for the hundreds of people coming to the market.

There were guards deployed at every corner of the road, to guide visitors and commuters. In addition, the civic body had also installed signages.

“The otherwise chaotic stretch looked peaceful and happening today. I hope, this arrangement will sustain forever and extend to other roads in the markets,” said Deependra Gupta, a resident of C-block, adding that after 30 years he could walk so freely on this stretch.

The best part about the changes in this market was the new seating arrangement, according to visitors. “We can sit, rest and shop some more. This has always been my favourite market in Delhi, but there was too much hustle-bustle earlier,” said Ananya Kaushik, who had come for her wedding shopping.

While the vehicle-free stretch was punctuated at three crossings, where vehicles was running perpendicular to it, shoppers and pedestrians were strolling down at rest of the streets meant only for them.

VADODARA: A physics professor of M S University (MSU) lost Rs 59,749 to a cyber fraud when he tried selling a cupboard on an online marketplace on January 4.

Professor Surjit Mukherjee was approached by a man named Sunil Kumar on January 4 morning after he posted advertisement on an online platform. Kumar, who claimed to be from Rajasthan, showed interest in buying the cupboard which was put on sale for Rs 2,500.

However, he said that another person will pick up the cupboard and will contact him.

“The other person immediately called me up and insisted on making payment through online platform. I told him to pay in cash since it is a small amount but as he kept insisting, I agreed with him,” said Mukherjee.

Mukherjee received a QR code on his phone through WhatsApp which he was asked to scan. The fraudsters told him that they will be able to make the payment only after he scans the code.

“I was unaware how the payments are made as I had never made payments using a QR code, so I did it as per their instructions,” Mukherjee added. The accused kept him busy on the call and simultaneously asked him to scan the code. They made him scan the code four times by saying that they are not able to make the payment.

Later, another QR code was sent to him and he was asked to scan eight times. Mukherjee became suspicious when they mentioned about his wife’s bank account and asked for his debit card’s details so he hung up the call.

By that time he had received SMSs from his bank mentioning that Rs 59,749 had been debited from his bank account in different amounts. Mukherjee called back on the numbers from which he had received the calls, but the calls went unanswered.

The physicist then went to his bank to seek the account statement and inform the bank about the fraud. On advice of the bank officials, he went to Cyber Crime police station and submitted an application to lodge an offence.

The cops have not yet registered the case. Mukherjee has also registered a complaint on Reserve Bank of India’s grievance portal.

Several complaints to the effect were made by councilors to Mayor Naveen Jain, He set up a three-member committee headed by additional municipal commissioner Vinod Kumar to investigate the matter.

On Monday, Jain presented the investigation report at a special house session.

The investigation revealed that the companies did only 10.5% of the garbage collection work in 83 wards of the city. The companies produced fake bills to get payments. It was also found that a majority of the addresses and details of residents given by the companies as evidence of door-to-door garbage collection were fake.

During the board meeting, councilors claimed that some of the civic body officials were hand in glove with the five private companies. They demanded recovery of the money paid from the companies and strict action against the officials concerned.

Agra MP SP Singh Baghel, Agra, South, MLA Yogendra Upadhyaya and Agra, North, MLA Purshottam Khandelwal also attended the municipal house session.

Legislator Upadhyaya said, “This is the biggest scam in the history of the municipal corporation. Officials failed a good plan of door-to-door garbage collection to fill their pockets. The civic body administration must register an FIR. And recovery should be made from the private companies.”

Another MLA Purshottam Khandelwal said, “The companies have been indulging in corruption in door-to-door collection work since 2018. Over the past several months, councilors have been complaining about it. But officials without even verifying the work done by the companies have made payments to them. There should be no leniency in the entire matter. The process of recovery of public funds looted by the private companies in connivance with the civic body officials should be initiated. Severe action should be taken against the officials involved in the entire scam.”

Mayor Jain said, “The five companies involved in the entire scam will be blacklisted. They will have to pay back the money paid to them on the basis of fake bills. Departmental action will be taken against the sanitation inspectors. Environment engineer Rajiv Rathi will be relieved of all charges. State government will be requested to take strict action against him. Our councillors and officials who conducted the investigation have done a commendable job in revealing the entire scam.”

KOCHI: Efforts by the Cochin Smart Mission Ltd ( CSML ) to construct a sewage treatment plant at Mundamvely in West Kochi had to be stopped due to protests from local residents. As a result, pipes worth Rs 39 crore procured for the project and the remaining amount of the Rs 200-crore project funded by Asian Development Bank (ADB) had gone down the drain.

It was in the beginning of 2010 that the project was designed under Kerala Sustainable Urban Development Project (KSUDP). The project was first delayed after Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) and Kerala State Pollution Control Board (PCB) raised objection against setting up the plant by reclaiming the wetland at Mundamvely. Later, the authorities decided to set up the plant at Fort Kochi. But that plan too didn’t work following objection from local residents. After Kerala Water Authority (KWA), the nodal agency, failed to implement the project even after receiving an extension by six months, ADB cancelled the funding for the project in 2016.

Interestingly, Kochi corporation had not given sanction to dig over 100km of roads to lay the pipeline network as part of the project mooted by the local body itself. It was the protests from the local residents that forced the authorities to deny permission to dig up the roads. There were also stiff opposition from the locals against constructing sumps in different locations for storing the waste collected from the locality and pumping it to the treatment plant.

159,['7/01/2020'],Transplantation moves a bid to make case for Bharat Van road?,"This story is from January 7, 2020

HOGWASH: Sources say, by doing transplantation, the Metro is trying to impress the higher authorities that it ... Read More

Nagpur: The MahaMetro is going through the motions of transplantation, even at the cost of public money, to allegedly create a case to construct a road through Bharat Van mini-forest in Bharat Nagar, according to some activists and officials. The road is being opposed by citizens who feel that there is no need for the connecting road from Bharat Nagar Square towards Telangkhedi as it will destroy a thriving biodiversity habitat.

A well-placed source told TOI that by constantly mentioning transplantation, the Metro is trying to impress the authorities that it is not against environment and is doing utmost to save trees. “What however is being left unsaid is the survival rate which is very poor,” the source said.

For the third time in a row, MahaMetro’s transplantation efforts have completely failed. In December 2017, the agency transplanted 15 trees of different species at a newly built residential society in Mihan. When TOI re-visited the site in July last year, hardly two-three trees could be called ‘alive’.

The second transplantation was carried out at Patwardhan high school premises in Sitabuldi, where the agency transplanted 21 trees. Though in a Right to Information (RTI) query MahaMetro claimed that all the trees were “alive and growing”, the reality was completely different. Hardly two trees showed little signs of life, with the rest of them being dead.

Environment activists and citizens, who have been fighting to save Bharat Van since over a year, are of the strong opinion that MahaMetro’s transplantation initiatives are a “tactic to pave way for the proposed road”.

The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court is hearing a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) based on a letter by honorary wildlife warden of Nagpur Jaydeep Das.

TOI has access to affidavits submitted by MahaMetro in the court. At four-to-five places, the agency has stated that it plans to transplant over 500 trees of Bharat Van. In one of the affidavits, MahaMetro has even stated that the process will be done using “latest scientific methods”.

Pointing out that the latest scientific methods have been a complete failure three times, activists said that MahaMetro is trying to hoodwink the judiciary. “The agency is making dubious claims of transplantation to destroy Bharat Van, even when it is clearly proved that the process is a big failure. Before taking any decision, the judiciary should take into account the ground reality,” said Das.

Stating that Metro’s transplantation is a 100% failure, environment activist Surbhi Jaiswal said, “To ensure that the concerned authorities are not misled, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation should inform the court about the findings of its spot inspections and failed transplantation of trees.”

160,['7/01/2020'],Scramble to lure independents begins,"This story is from January 7, 2020

The residents of rural local bodies could heave a sigh of relief for getting their civic representatives after a gap of three years. But an independent councillor jumping off the compound wall soon after taking oath on Monday to escape being whisked away by political party members has come as a stark reminder of the challenges ahead for effective functioning of rural civic bodies.

The smooth functioning of the civic bodies appears a difficult task as both the primary rivals – DMK and AIADMK – have more or less equal strength in the district panchayat and panchayat union councils.

Irrespective of whether DMK manages to grab the chairperson’s post or the AIADMK gets it, the civic body chief will have a tough time keeping the house in order, say partymen.

There were enough indications of the likely confrontations between the two parties on Monday, the day of swearing in. While Aravind, the independent councillor from Chellampatti panchayat union in Madurai jumped off the compound wall of the union office to flee from the partymen waiting outside to get him, there were instances of either of the parties whisking away such independent councillors in other places.

Worse, in Thiruvarankulam in Pudukottai and Mannargudi in Tiruvarur, the partymen from AIADMK and DMK clashed with each other, police said. At Kovilpatti, the AIADMK men staged a protest alleging that DMK workers had whisked away independent candidates. “If one party enjoys majority in the council, then there would be no issues. But when the rival parties have equal number of councillors, then the support of independents becomes crucial for electing the chairperson and vice chairperson. Hence, the partymen want to keep independent councillors under their control to prevent them from supporting the rival party,’’ a police officer said.

In some places, where the independent councillors wield heft, they are demanding the civic chief posts, he said.

In Krishnagiri district, police arrested six people and booked cases on 13 more after a clash erupted between residents of two villages in getting their natives to the civic chief post. The villagers of Puthupatti and Moongileri near Uthangarai started attacking each other even as the swearing in was underway.

The public though, hope that the councillors would set aside their party differences and work together. All these while it was the special officers who were running the day to day affairs of the rural civic bodies. Once the district panchayat councillors and panchayat union councillors elect their chairperson, the civic bodies would take over the financial functions from the special officers who were carrying out the work for the past three years in the absence of the council.

Coimbatore: Several outfits including students organisations in the city on Monday held demonstrations condemning the violence against the students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi.

The protesters also demanded the arrest of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) members, who allegedly attacked and injured the students and faculty members on JNU campus.

Members of the Students Federation of India (SFI) held a protest at the gate of the Government Arts College. Members of the All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) and Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) held a protest near the south taluk office. JNU alumni from the city also participated in the protest.

On Monday evening, members of SFI, All India Students Federation (AISF), Students Islamic Organisation of India (SIO) and Campus Front of India (CFI) held a joint protest at Aathupaalam in the city.

District representative of SFI Dhinesh Raja said the attack on JNU students was a premeditated one. “How else could 50 masked goons enter the campus and wreak havoc? ABVP has been inciting violence on the campus. Aishe Ghosh, the president of Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union and SFI’s central committee member, has been brutally attacked. Teachers were also attacked. Those responsible for this must be arrested and brought to justice,” he said.

VADODARA: A Class X student living on Harni Road ended his life by jumping into Narmada canal near Motnath Mahadev Temple in Harni area on January 4.

The boy’s body was fished out from the canal at Ankodiya by fire brigade officials on Monday evening. Police said the deceased, identified as Ritwik Karnik, was dejected after being pulled up by his father over studies.

Ritwik had left his home on a scooter on the afternoon of January 4. When his parents returned from work in the evening, they could not find him anywhere. His father Nikhil asked his elderly mother about his whereabouts. She said that Ritwik had left around 1pm saying that he would be back in a while. But as the 15-year-old did not return till late evening, his parents started inquiring with their relatives and the boy’s friends. His father works as a purchase manager in a local tobacco company.

Police said that when nobody had any idea about the boy, the parents went towards the canal to search for him. They found the scooter with the key intact with the vehicle around late night, but the boy was nowhere to be found. Next day they approached the police and filed a missing person’s complaint. Nikhil told the cops that he had scolded his son, asking him to focus on his studies as it was a crucial year for his career.

On receiving the complaint, the cops asked the fire department to search for Ritwik in the canal but they could not find him till late in the evening. On Monday evening, Ritwik’s body was found floating in the canal water near Ankodiya village on the outskirts of the city. “The boy was dejected by the scolding he received from his father. Hence, he left the house and ended his life,” said an official from Harni police station.

AGRA: Hundreds of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) students took out a ‘Tiranga march’ on the varsity campus on Monday to express solidarity with the JNU students and teachers who were targeted by masked goons in Delhi on Sunday.

AMU teachers also took out a peaceful candle protest march on Monday evening in support of the JNU students and teachers. Noted historian and Professor emeritus Irfan Habib claimed that whatever happened in JNU on Sunday was unprecedented in the country’s history. He said, “Protest is very much required to express solidarity with JNU.”

Speaking on the amended citizenship law, Habib said that CAA is not only against Muslims but also affects poor people, orphans and illiterate persons.

AMU students shouted anti-BJP and anti-RSS slogans during the Tiranga march and pledged their full support to JNU and Jamia Millia students, urging them to put up a fight.

Students’ leader Faizul Hassan, who led the ‘Tiranga March’, said, “We held the tri-colour in our hand to show that we belong to this country. It doesn’t represent any religion or community. We want to convey it to the government that they must withdraw CAA and NRC.”

Giving a memorandum to the President through local administration, the students demanded that the university should open at the earliest and the academic session must begin.

“We strongly condemn the violence unleashed on the students and teachers at JNU, in the presence of Delhi Police. We urge you to direct the police to find and punish the culprits immediately,” the memorandum said.

The students also alleged that the state police have been using communal slurs and harassing minority communities.

Police forces were deployed outside the campus in order to maintain law and order.

Aligarh SSP Akash Kulhary said that the students took out a peaceful march. “I have received the memorandum from students and will send it to the President,” he said.

AGRA: Firozabad superintendent of police Sachindra Patel on Monday shunted Nalband Chouraha police outpost in-charge sub-inspector Rajeev Kumar Chitransh and two beat constables to Police Lines, after a probe by CO (city) blamed the three cops of negligence. This, days after a dead man and two 90-year-olds, one of whom is bedridden while the other is a pneumonic patient, were served notice of CrPc 107/116 by Firozabad police in the wake of anti-CAA violence.

Speaking to TOI, SP Patel said, “Three cops, including SI Rajeev Kumar Chitransh and constables Pushpender and Mahendra, have been sent to Police Lines. In his probe, CO (city) Arun Kumar found all three were guilty of negligence. They didn’t cross check details of the three men they notified, before sending their names to the magistrate for bound notices.”

After the violence on December 20, district administration invoked CrPc sections 107/116(3) against nearly 200 men whom they considered “troublemakers”, forcing these men to seek bail against a personal bond with sureties. Proceedings under these sections are drawn when the magistrate receives information and believes there is substantial ground for proceeding against the person(s) named. Police identify potential troublemakers on the basis of intelligence, mostly provided by beat constables, SIs or reports by police outpost in-charges.

Among the recipients of these notices were Banne Khan (87), who died six years ago, Fasahat Meer Khan (93) of Kotla Mohalla, who is bedridden for months and Sufi Ansar Hussain (90) of Kotla Pathanan, who is suffering from pneumonia and has just returned after treatment from Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.

SI Chitransh is also the complainant in the case on the December 20 violence. In his FIR, he had accused oral cancer patient Ahemad Nabi (52) and another local Faraz Khan (19) as prime accused for leading “violent anti-CAA protests and raising anti-BJP slogans”.

Vakeel Nabi (48), younger brother of Ahemad Nabi, said, “How can we trust the FIRs against six men, including an oral cancer patient, by an officer who filed wrong reports against a deceased man and a bedridden patient to the magistrate for issuing bound notices?”

Thiruvananthapuram: Motorists stuck in a traffic jam at Edapazhanji on Monday morning were in for a surprise when tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran rushed to the aid of the lone traffic home guard on duty at the junction. It was utter chaos at the junction with vehicles coming from all four direction converging, with the traffic signal flashing orange, leading to long queues on the connecting roads from Jagathy, Poojappura, Sasthamangalam and Vazhuthacaud.

Kadakampally was on his way to attend a programme in Kattakkada when his official vehicle got caught up in the gridlock at around 9.30am. After waiting for a few minutes, he got out of his car to analyse the situation. When he realised that there is only one home guard on duty, the minister too joined to regulate the movement of vehicles.

Nedumanagad DSP Stuart Keeler who was also stuck in traffic soon joined the minister before help arrived from the traffic department.

With four major roads converging at the junction, with a major hospital and prominent market in close proximity the junction a very busy zone. Traffic snarls are a regular feature here during morning and evening peak hours.

The minister later told reporters that he will contact the officials concerned and direct them to clear the issue at the earliest.

“The junction requires at least four or five traffic officers to handle the volume of vehicles,” he said.

DSP Keeler said he was on his way to a special conference called by rural SP B Asokan which was scheduled at 11am when he too got caught in traffic. “My vehicle had passed SK Hospital but which time the traffic slowed to a crawl. So I decided to intervene and on reaching the junction, I was told by the tourism minister’s gunman that Kadakampally Surendran is also stuck in traffic. As we started clearing the traffic near the hospital, the minister stepped out and started helping the home guard on duty at the junction. Eventually, we managed to clear the initial bottleneck of vehicles at the junction and traffic enforcement arriving soon afterwards helped clear the issue completely,” he told TOI.

Digvijaya Singh

BHOPAL: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh has expressed deep anguish over Sunday’s attack on students at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), and called it “gross intelligence failure”.

“Heads must roll, or else home minister Amit Shah will be held responsible for violence in the most prestigious university of India,” Digvijaya said on Monday.

In a series of tweets on the incident, the former CM questioned the role of ABVP activists and Delhi Police , and wondered why the cops couldn’t prevent violence.

“JNU has an alumni list of eminent persons, ranging from Prime Ministers, ministers in GOI, ministers in state governments, Nobel laureate and civil servants to activists in civil society and members of Parliament cutting across party lines and other fields that we are proud of,” he tweeted.

In a second tweet, he pointed out that the finance minister and external affairs minister of the Modi government, too, are JNU alumni. “Shouldn't they all stand together not only to condemn on social media, but to force the home minister to take strong action against the ABVP goons? What was Delhi Police doing? Couldn’t they have prevented it?” he said.

He attributed the JNU violence to intelligence failure and asked Amit Shah to ensure strong action against those responsible for “letting such an unfortunate incident take place”. “If it is not done, Shah, himself, will be held responsible for the violence. Isn’t it a gross intelligence failure? What was IB or the intelligence wing of Delhi Police doing? Amit Shah, heads must roll, or else we shall hold you responsible for this violence against students of our most prestigious university which has given us leaders of such eminence,” he wrote.

Nagpur: Ideologically opposed camps of students seem to be headed for a face off as Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and Babasaheb Ambedkar Students Association (BASA) have called for a protest in front of Nagpur University campus on Amravati Road at the same time on Tuesday.

The development comes after a series of protests were held in the city by ABVP and Left parties, which were supported by BASA, on Monday itself to condemn the violence by masked goons on Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus in Delhi a day before.

It seems both the sides have not taken police permission for the protests or else either of them would have been shifted or denied permission for the same spot. As per social media posts, the protests are scheduled at 9.30am, a fact confirmed by office-bearers too.

ABVP’s city secretary Amit Patle ruled out any move for confrontation or deliberate attempt to hold the protests at the same time near NU campus. Patle said he was aware of the BASA protest. “If they are present at the spot, we will shift to another square near the campus. I have instructed all the members to not fall prey to any mischief or provocation,” he said.

Patle said Tuesday’s protest will be peaceful. “We organized several peaceful demonstrations at colleges across the city on Monday. We informed students about the reality of JNU violence and how ABVP members were attacked and injured. We want to make more students aware of the ongoing smear campaign by Leftists organizations,” he said.

BASA president Bhushan Waghmare said the association members are university students and would be accompanied by teachers during the peaceful protest hence there’s no need for police permission. “We are students and bound by university rules. We are only going to demand justice for aggrieved students and teachers of JNU. We are not taking any sides or pointing finger at any organization,” he said.

While ABVP expects around 100 members to participate, the BASA too may attract equal numbers as it has mass following among the students.

Meanwhile, a group of youth, which protested against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed NRC at Samvidhan Square in the city on January 4 under the banner of Nagpur Youth Organisation (NYO), submitted a memorandum to collector Ravindra Thakre, demanding repeal of the amended Act and for protecting the Constitution.

The group was accompanied by lawyer Akshay Samarth. The delegation included Shalaka Bhandarkar, Tejaswini Kalmegh, Ishaan Wasu, Javed Iqbal, Swaroop Bhartiya, Tuba Sanobar, Kunal Chandel, Faizan Khan, Preeti Sarvey, Yashas Mahajan, Sultan Sheikh, Bhushan Dahat, Uzma Ahmad, Fouzia Ahmad, Riddhi Lad, Rushank Lad, Parag Dahat, Adiba Seher and others.

LUCKNOW: In last three years, Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) has ordered razing of 470 commercial buildings constructed in violation of norms but officials have so far been able to demolish only three buildings.During inspections, LDA officials found that owners had either constructed the entire building or a part of it without getting the map approved or were not following fire safety norms.“In some cases, the entire construction was illegal while in others, builders added more floors and units than approved in the map. There were many who had not taken ‘no objection certificate’ from fire department,” an LDA official said.Officials found that in some cases, area marked for parking of vehicles was also encroached by builders for additional construction which led to traffic snarls.Notices were slapped on the owners to get things rectified and pay the fine that amounted to around Rs 70 crore. However, nothing significant was done thereafter.LDA vice-chairman SK Dwivedi, who took charge last week, admitted lapses in action against illegal buildings and assured that a probe would be conducted to fix responsibilities.“An internal probe will be carried out into the role of zonal and junior engineers who were supposed to carry out demolitions,” he told TOI.Dwivedi said fresh notices would be issued to owners of buildings to pay fine and complete all official requirements within seven days, failing which their establishments would be demolished and FIRs lodged against them on charges of illegal construction and not following government orders.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73131037,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-125590,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/470-illegal-commercial-bldgs-but-lda-razed-only-5-in-3-yrs/articleshow/73130290.cms

The Mominpura burial ground committee is now charging Rs 200 for issuing 'ghat copy' while the service is free... Read More

NAGPUR: Alarmed by the imminent implementation of National Population Register ( NPR ) exercise to be followed by National Register of Citizens (NRC), several city Muslims are now running from pillar to post trying to gather their own documents as well as those of their forefathers to prove citizenship.

Though there is no clarity yet on what documentation will be needed, people are starting with birth and death certificates. Civic officials have observed a spurt in number of Muslims applicants compared to others and the rush is getting bigger.

The basic reason Muslims are first in the queue is the fear of becoming stateless in case they fail to make it to NRC as Citizenship (Amendment) Act has excluded the community from seeking citizenship.

For many, the first destination are Qabristans (cemeteries) where their parents and grandparents are buried. The unusual visits are necessitated by incomplete birth and death records of their parents and grandparents beside their own.

On Monday, TOI visited NMC birth and death department, burial grounds at Jaripatka and Mominpura, which are said to be the oldest in city dating back to 1857. Officials at all three places confirmed that there is a sudden rush for retrieving birth and death records.

NMC health officer and sub-registrar Atequr Raheman Khan said so far many didn’t care to keep decades old death certificates or have misplaced them. “We are yet to get any guidelines but people want to keep all records in place,” he said.

Khan said people can search their records online too on NMC website or visit his department.

Worried citizens queuing up since morning at NMC’s Civil Lines office are directed to bring a ‘ghat copy’ or acknowledgement from the place where last rites were held for further processing of a delayed birth/death certificate.

At Mominpura, records are available from 1938 while they received a request for 1925 death certificate a couple of days back. Jaripatka officials said they have records from 1965. People need to show slips issued by Qabristan committee at the time of burial to get a ‘ghat copy’ or burial acknowledment letter.

Several document seekers are those whose parents passed away and they don’t have their birth/death certificates. Surprisingly they have their grandparents documents. “People feel death certificate will be matched with birth/death certificate of grandparents to show their parents were legitimate Indian citizens beside their own papers,” an official said.

Another provision under Section 13(3) of Registration of Births and Deaths 1969 permits issuance of certificates subject to certain condidtions. An applicant has to bring a ‘ghat copy’ and submit it with ID proof of deceased to the department which conducts a police verification and get prepares a non-avialiablity (NA) proposal to be put before JMFC. The applicant then has to get an favourable order based on which the NMC issues the certificate. For delayed birth certificates, school leaving certificate and ID proof has to be submitted for preparing the NA proposal.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The riot in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi triggered protests in the city since Sunday midnight. SFI activists organized a Raj Bhavan march at midnight to launch the protest in the city, which culminated with the ‘Protest Fire’ campaign held at Gandhi Park on Monday night. The protest fire event went on till Monday midnight and concluded with all participants lighting a torch and taking a pledge to protect the Constitution of India.

The 5,000-odd protesters who gathered at Gandhi Park were shocked to hear the narrative by Surya Krishnan, a student of JNU who was on the campus on Sunday. “Six people rounded me up and brutally attacked. They tried to break my left hand. I have suffered bruises on my right hand, and I cannot lift that up,” said Surya who reached the city on Monday.

“The ABVP members would walk in front of us with outsiders and they would point their fingers right at us, saying ‘They were at the protests, we should do something about it’. You can see there are stitches on my head and my hand is bruised, this is their so called ‘Aarsha Bharatha’ culture,” he said. After a brief appearance at the gathering, Surya was taken to a city hospital for treatment.

Palayam Imam Suhaib Maulavi also addressed the Gandhi Park event organised by CPM Chalai area committee. “Our constitution has given us the right to profess any faith, follow any religion and even to be an atheist. That is the beauty of our democracy , but now, a malicious campaign has been organised by the Modi government to divide this country and rule in order to establish a religious–fascist country. We should resist this by standing united,” the Imam said.

Members of citizens’ movement titled ‘We the People’ also conducted a protest march on the assault against students of JNU, along with raising demands of rejecting CAA and boycott of NRC. The march began at Gandhi Park on Monday evening and concluded in front of the Secretariat. Academic and social critic J Devika, who addressed the gathering, said there is still a belief that CAA and NRC will only affect a certain community; this needs to change. “The Centre is tricking all the citizens with the fake coin called tribunal. Has any promise made by Narendra Modi ever been fulfilled before?,” she said.

Researchers and faculty members of Centre for Development Studies organised a protest march from CDS campus Akkulam to Ulloor Junction in the evening.

Activists of AIYF took out a march to AG’s office in the evening to register protest against the attack on JNU students. State secretary Mahesh Kakkath inaugurated the march.

BHOPAL: The court of judicial magistrate first class (JMFC), Rohit Shrivastava, on Monday dismissed the defamation suit filed by former chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan , against Congress leader K K Mishra.

Mishra, in his capacity as chief spokesperson of state Congress, had accused the then chief minister and his wife of being involved in Vyapam scam following which a defamation suit on behalf of state government was filed by the public prosecutor charging that Mishra had defamed the MP government by levelling “wild” charges against its chief minister.

Mishra was held guilty by then additional district & sessions judge, Kashinath Singh who sentenced him to 2 years of imprisonment and imposed a penalty of Rs 25,000.

However, a Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Ranjan Gogoi discharged him, holding that the defamation suit should have been filed by Shivraj Singh Chouhan in his individual capacity if he had felt that Mishra sought to publicly defame him and not by the state government as it had nothing to do with the state government and charges were against Chouhan and not the state government. He had, however, allowed Chouhan to file a defamation suit in his personal capacity in the court of JMFC, Bhopal .

Chouhan, later, filed the defamation suit in his individual capacity and his counsel sought condonation of delay in filing the suit, which was strongly opposed by counsel for Mishra, who argued that while public prosecutor filed defamation suit on behalf of the state government, Chouhan should have filed a parallel suit in his personal capacity but he was not serious about the suit then nor is he serious now. He was trying his luck then and is doing it again, which amounts to abuse of the process of law, he argued.

The court convinced with arguments of Mishra’s counsel on Tuesday ordered dismissal of Chouhan’s defamation suit.

173,['7/01/2020'],2 Maithan Ispat officers held for GST tax fraud,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Bhubaneswar: Goods and service tax (GST) officials have arrested two top executives of Maithan Ispat Limited, a Mesco Steel subsidiary, for allegedly acquiring Rs 23 crore input tax credit (ITC) without furnishing requisite documents.

“Maithan’s assistant general manager (taxation) Surendra Patra and general manager (finance) Manas Ranjan Padhi were arrested on Thursday for allegedly masterminding a fraud,” GST officials said on Monday.

“We found that Maithan Ispat Ltd at Kalinga Nagar in Jajpur district acquired fictitious input tax credit between April 2018 and November 2018 without the due support of relevant documents,” Santosh Kumar Mohanty, additional director (directorate general of GST intelligence, Bhubaneswar), said. “They took inflated ITC in their GST return without receipts of any goods and services. They had no requisite documents to claim the credit,” he added.

The directorate general of GST intelligence began an investigation after it received information about the alleged tax fraud. Following this, GST officials raided Maithan’s factory and office premises in Jajpur and found evidence of the alleged tax offence. They also found that the company had ‘illegally’ applied for Rs 23 crore ITC while filing GST return from April 2018 to November 2018. Report said the two executives allegedly claimed the money as their GST liability in a ‘fraudulent manner’.

GST authorities said the alleged offence of the company caused a loss of Rs 23 crore to the government exchequer.

“Further investigation revealed that Patra and Padhi were behind the manipulation. Efforts are on to recover the government dues along with interest and penalty,” Mohanty said.

Patra, who was arrested in Bhubaneswar, was produced him in the court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM). On the other hand, Padhi was caught in Kolkata and produced in the court of additional chief judicial magistrate, Sealdah, in Kolkata. The two were sent to 14-day judicial custody. Maithan Ispat authorities were not available for comment.

The leopard was sent to chiriyapur rescue centre at Haridwar

HARIDWAR: A leopard was rescued from a house in Anguda village of Bhilangna block of Tehri on Monday. The animal had strayed into the house while chasing the owner’s pet dog. The forest department managed to trap it in a cage and sent it to Chidiyapur rescue centre at Haridwar.

The leopard was chasing the dog of a man, Nagendera Singh. As the dog took refuge in the family’s storeroom, the animals followed it there. The dog escaped and Singh’s nephew, who had witnessed the episode, locked the leopard in the room. The forest department has increased patrolling in the area, anticipating the presence of more leopards, as villagers complained of the threat.

In Dehradun , an animal rescue team has been put on alert after two leopards were sighted near IPS colony in the city on Monday. The entire belt stretching from the foothills of Mussoorie, Raipur range, Jhajhra to Asharodi, has leopards in it. The animals are sighted every day as they travel at least 25 to 30 kms per day. Rapid urbanisation is another reason for frequent leopard sightings.

Another leopard was rescued recently from Pauri. The wild cat had entered the bathroom of a house and the owner locked the door from outside

Police and students in JNU campus, after some masked miscreants attacked the campus (PTI Phot)

KOLKATA: As news of the attack on their alma mater flashed across TV screens on Sunday evening, former students of Jawaharlal Nehru University reached out, calling up current students to offer help and solidarity and posting updates on social media.

Some, like Abhinav Sharma, who had stayed at Sabarmati Hostel—where masked, lathi-wielding goons entered and assaulted students and professors indiscriminately—took a flight to Delhi the very next day to stand by the people he had been so close to. “I couldn’t stay calm. I saw photos and videos of the assault on some of my juniors and teachers and rushed to JNU on Monday to meet them. In a WhatsApp video, I saw my guide, professor Sucharita Sen, being severely injured. I have come here to meet her. I couldn’t speak to her at length as she said she was still in pain and trauma. But as a former student of JNU, my blood boils at the sight of the carnage at the institute and we will see an end to it,” Sharma told TOI over phone. From Kolkata, Sharma passed out of JNU last year after completing his PhD and now, teaches at an institute in Shillong.

Another such protester is Indrani Dutt, a political science student from Presidency College, who did her MA in JNU and is now employed with a top Indian business conglomerate in its communications wing. “I have been writing on closed WhatsApp groups and trying to collect news about my juniors. In the morning, I put out a Facebook post. I was amazed how some tried to justify the attacks. I have stayed at Sabarmati. Some of my closest friends there never shared my political ideology but we never stooped this low. I wonder what happened to good old days,” she said.

The Facebook post she mentioned was: “My post did not have any political party mentioned nor do I wish to support or shame anyone. I feel extremely disturbed looking at the situation in the country and especially my alma mater. Please allow me my space to show my disappointment... hope this answers all your questions!!! As regards the university and its history... This has been the hub of intellectual brilliance over ages and given the world eminent scholars and academicians only. Don’t know why and on whose insistence this violence crept into every educational institution across d country only in recent times!!”

The more politically vocal former students wondered if the impunity with which the attack was carried out was a well-laid plan. Prasenjit Bose, one of the most recognizable faces of the SFI at JNU even after years of leaving the university did not mince his words, sharing alleged screenshots of what he claimed “were preparations for the attack”. “Having accomplished their terror attacks across campus, the fascist Stormtroopers left JNU with full impunity. Delhi Police will act only after they leave…” he wrote, blaming top central ministers for failing to stop the attack.

Dwaipayan Bera, who studied economics at Presidency and did MA at JNU, updated every detail he got through the night. “Who says it’s just Italian fascist blackshirts , last night they were vintage hooded Klu Klux Klan!” he said, in a reference to an American much-hated supremacist gang. “The violence is unheard of. But the students must be united at this time of crisis,” he wrote.

176,['7/01/2020'],Rehabilitation centre for disabled people cries for new equipment,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Coimbatore: At least 20 people suffering from various forms of physical disabilities come to the department for disabled people daily at the collectorate on weekdays to undergo free physiotherapy and access muscle strengthening and flexibility equipment free of cost. Ironically, most of the equipment in the department are outdated and rusting.

Though the department had requested for replacement and upgradation of the equipment at its rehabilitation centre, the government is yet to sanction fund. Instead, the department has been asked to move out of the current space. Neither the department was able to find a new space nor get the fund from the government.

Sikkandar Basha, 36, suffered a stroke six years ago with his entire right side paralyzed and trouble in speaking.

His mother and brother used to bring him in their vehicle and leave him at the rehabilitation centre within the district administration hoping for some improvement.

“I can now take a bus, come to the centre on my own, eat on my own and return. Earlier I could not even walk,” Basha said when asked about the improvement he has had after coming to the centre.

“Besides becoming physically independent, this place is my confidence booster, because its free to use. They get us a bus pass, so even that is free. And now they have given me a job as a sweeper, helping me earn close to Rs 1,000 a month, making me slightly financially independent too,” another beneficiary Sebastian said.

The rehabilitation centre that was started nearly 21 years back has one physiotherapist, two physiotherapy students interning with them and 12 machines which primarily focus on muscle strengthening. This includes the exercise cycle to focus on lower limb and ankle strengthening, the sliding chair which helps strengthen quadriceps muscles, abduction reduction for shoulder strengthening and finger ladders for finger strengthening, among others.

“While some machines are very old, the other came around six years back after the collector issued us a special grant. Though the majority work, updated versions are available in the market,” an official said. The ultrasound machine for pain relief has stopped working too. “Newer equipment will work better on our new patients and will attract more poor people to use our centre which is free, rather than go to private places which charge at least Rs 1,000 a month plus Rs 300 with a physiotherapist or not get treated at all,” the official said.

The disabled department commissioner has agreed to replace the equipment but has put it on hold since the disability welfare department has been asked to shift premises by the district administration. The district administration plans to demolish the old buildings. “We are constantly searching for a new space,” district disabled welfare officer Thangamani said.

“Because, if we get the new equipment now, we will have to install it and then remove it during shifting to the new space,” he said.

Lucknow: Country’s first private semi-high speed train Tejas Express departed late by one hour from Lucknow on Monday. Officials said passengers are entitled for compensation due to the delay.

Tejas Express leaves Lucknow at 6.10am and reaches New Delhi railway station at 12.25pm. On return, it leaves Delhi at 3.35pm and reaches here at 10.05pm. The maximum delay was on Saturday, when the train arrived at Lucknow station 3.56 hours late.

Passengers said that they prefer shelling out more for booking Tejas ticket because it is said to be safe and punctual, but now it is also running late like other trains.

Tamanna Seth, who came to drop her parents at Lucknow junction, said, “My septuagenarian parents avoid air journey, hence they opted for Tejas Express... They had to wait in the cold weather on the platform for an hour due to the delay.”

Chief regional manager, IRCTC, Lucknow, Ashwini Srivastava said, “The train is running late mainly because of fog. If the delay is between one and two hours, passengers are given Rs 100 as compensation. If the delay exceeds two hours, they get Rs 250.”

Besides Tejas, 24 other trains arrived and departed late from various Lucknow stations on Monday. They included Rajdhani Express, Gomti Express, Marudhar Express, Doon Express, Avadh Assam Express, Rapti Sagar Express and Kota-Patna Express.

Senior divisional commercial manager, northern railway, Lucknow division, Jagtosh Shukla said, “Dense fog in various parts of northern region is the main reason behind late arrival and departure of trains.”

Coimbatore: A group of ‘108’ ambulance drivers on Monday petitioned the collector requesting him to buy new ambulance vehicles.

The drivers, members of the Tamil Nadu 108 Ambulance Drivers Welfare Association, said that most of the ambulances in the city have three lakh kilometres and are badly maintained. “It is important that ambulances run well and smoothly as they carry hundreds of people fighting for their lives. But most of our vehicles are not fit for use. They are also not maintained well. We demand that these vehicles be changed,” said driver M Guna. “There are no proper sheds to park the vehicles and clean them regularly. Many of the patients vomit and bleed while being carried to hospitals. We just park the vehicles on the road and clean them.”

As many as 39 such vehicles operate in the district, including two bike ambulances and two neonatal ambulances.

The drivers demanded an increase in salaries and complained about forced transfer to other states and districts. “Despite being paid just Rs 12,000 a month, we get penalized even for small damages to the vehicles. We have to pay up even if a tree branch falls on the roof of the vehicles,” said the petition. “Those who protest are forcibly transferred to Kerala or to other districts. From every district, five to six people are transferred to Kerala. If we refuse, the administration threatens to fire us. This has to be stopped.”

Meanwhile, ‘108’ ambulance authorities said they had just begun operations in Kerala and technicians from Tamil Nadu are sent to the neighbouring state on two to three weeks deputations to train the staff there.

Muthukrishnan, ‘108’ ambulance administrator in Coimbatore, told TOI that many vehicles have crossed 3 lakh kilometres. “We have sent the list to the state government. The officials usually inspect the condemned vehicles and decide whether they can be used further or be used for the free hearse service. Regional transport officials inspect the vehicles for fitness every year and we have a maintenance schedule, which is followed strictly.”

The vehicles don’t have a specific parking shed or washing area as of now, the official said. “We are in talks with Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) dean B Ashokan for a space to wash the vehicles. But since the hospital is a place of mass gathering, the threat of infections is high. It also requires a corporation clearance. We are working on it,” he added.

KOLKATA: Police on Monday registered a suo motu FIR against BJP supporters for setting fire to a tyre on the road after their protest rally was stopped at Sulekha More in Jadavpur.

BJP workers took to the streets on Monday evening to protest against an alleged attack on their party office at Sulekha More on Sunday night. A group of students from Jadavpur University had allegedly defaced the BJP office, tore down banners and burnt the party’s flag.

“It was around 11.45pm on Sunday that a mob of around 200 youths gathered in front of our house. The BJP party office is on the ground floor,” said Arun Bardhan, the owner of the property. “They painted abusive words across the wall and tore down Syama Prasad Mukherjee’s poster. Some of them even removed BJP flags and set them on fire. My family is now too scared to stay here.”

Echoing him, Dibakar Pal, a member of the local BJP unit, said, “There were around 200 students who came with rods and torches and vandalized the office. They tried to break into the residence of a party worker at midnight. We have never seen such violence in Bagha Jatin area.”

In protest more than 200 BJP workers started a rally from Bagha Jatin on Monday evening but the procession was stopped midway at Sulekha More, where the cops put up a three-layer barricade to prevent any face- off.

NAGPUR: Newly-elected transport committee chairman Balya Borkar on Monday directed the civic administration to slap Rs5 lakh fine each on the three red bus operators and Rs2 lakh fine on programme manager DIMTS for keeping Aapli buses filthy.

On January 2 and 3, Borkar along with NMC’s transport department officials visited all three depots of red bus operators — Orange Street depot (Hingna), Patwardhan ground depot, and Khapri depot at 5am, and inspected 223 buses. “During the spot inspection, the team found poor maintenance of NMC run Aapli buses,” Borkar told TOI.

NMC had roped in three bus operators — Travel Times Car Rentals, RK City Operations, and Hansa City Bus Services — and is plying around 380 buses. Over 1.50 lakh commuters use the city bus service daily. TOI has been highlighting the issue of poor maintenance and other irregularities. In the recent past, TOI also reported many buses were stranded on the road, causing hardship to commuters. Of the over 380 buses plying every day, at least 200 have already completed 10 years.

Most standard buses emit thick black smoke, have damaged seats and broken windowpanes, hinting at poor maintenance. Even mayor Sandip Joshi had in December warned the operators to improve Aapli bus condition by month-end or ill-maintained buses will not be allowed to ply on city roads.

Despite repeated warnings nothing has improved, said Borkar. Som he along with transport department administrative officer Ravindra Page, executive engineer Kedar Mishra, labour officer Arun Pipurde and accounts officer Vinay Bharadwaj conducted surprise inspection of the bus depots.

Borkar said there was a provision to penalize red bus operators for poor maintenance of city buses. Despite this clause in the tender agreement, the programme manager DIMTS has not done anything and as a result commuters were facing inconvenience in travelling in the ill-maintained buses, he pointed out. “I have also directed the administration to impose Rs2 lakh fine on DIMTS,” he said.

Vadodara: The managing director of Vadodara Gas Ltd (VGL), who is also the chief general manager of Gail India Ltd, withdrew his anticipatory bail plea which had come up for hearing in the court of principal district judge here on Monday morning.

The bail applicant Ashokkumar Das had sought anticipatory bail in connection with the PNG blast case in which four persons had died in 2018 although he had not been named as an accused in the case.

In response to Das’s application, the investigating officer had requested the court that the bail application be cancelled. The complainant’s advocate too opposed the application as Das has been summoned by police for his statement.

“They reiterated the same thing as it was in the application that they only handle the CNG operations while the PNG operations are handled by the commercial director,” said complainant’s advocate Viraj Thakkar. He added that Das informed the court that he was under the fear of getting arrested to which the court said that if he had not done anything wrong then why he is under fear.

The sub-inspector of police informed the court that he had not summoned Das for arresting him but only to record his statements. The sub-inspector gave in writing to the court that Das would not be arrested without evidence against him.

“The police have assured that if evidence found against him, they will inform the MD 48 hours before arresting him,” Thakkar said.

184,['7/01/2020'],Nagpur: 21 crimes/day in city last year: Police data,"This story is from January 7, 2020

NAGPUR: The latest crime data released by the city police department revealed that state’s second capital witnessed 21 offences, including serious ones, in 2019. Commissioner of police BK Upadhyay on Monday claimed that prohibitory actions against goons and anti-social elements helped police decrease crime rate by 10% as compared to 2018.

In 2019, the city police registered 7,722 offences, including 83 murders and 75 attempt to murder cases. The total offences are 863 less than 2018 when 8,585 cases were registered.

Interacting with the media, the top cop said that 2019 was challenging for the department due to general and state assembly elections, winter session and several protests, including rallies on CAA-NRC and NPR issues.

In 2019, police cracked around 5,006 cases, while 2,716 remained unsolved. The detection rate increased by 3% as compared to 2018 when 5,369 cases were solved. CCTV cameras installed across the city helped cops crack many crimes in 2019, the CP said.

There was overall decline in major crimes in 2019 as compared to 2018, except in cases of domestic violence, criminal breach of trust and murder. In 2018, 77 murder cases were registered, which are six less as compared to 2019. On this, the CP said that of the 83 murders in 2019, 39 took place due to domestic issues.

On the recent attack on mayor Sandip Joshi, Upadhyay said the case should have been detected by now. “No major clue or motive has come to fore. We have narrowed our investigation to a person following some technical clues but there is no concrete proof yet,” he said.

The CP also set the agenda for this year, laying emphasis on women’s safety and police welfare. “In 2019, around 30 police constables had died. Out of them, 22 deaths were due to cardiac arrests. So, we are planning to create awareness regarding health and fitness among police personnel,” he said.

There are plans to categorize police constables on the basis of their health. According to the CP, those having heart problems will be assigned duties with less workload.

The CP also claimed that initiatives like Bharosa Cell, Damini Pathak and regular visits to college and school increased awareness among citizens about the law. “We are planning to give special focus on cyber crimes against women as it has become a big concern. The police chief urged citizens to not upload any private information on social media which can be used against them.

The city police chief has also said that undetected cases, including some murders, will be reviewed.

Joint CP Ravindra Kadam, additional CP (north region), additional CP (crime) Nilesh Bharne along with most of the DCPs were present at the press conference.

The family hailing from city covered the distance in just nine days

NAGPUR: Cycling runs (or should we say pedals) in this family of four from the city. The quartet, comprising two girls aged 14 and 10, recently “pedalled over 500km” to complete anexpedition covering the stretch of Western Ghats from Goa to Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri and Raigad districts in Konkan in just nine days.

Hasan Shafiq, Sarah Shafiq, along with their elder daughter Batul and her sibling Fatema started the cycling expedition from Panaji (Goa) on December 23 and reached Nagaon village in Alibaugh tehsil of Raigad on December 30.

The expedition organized by Youth Hostels Association of India (YHAI) saw participation by 29 cyclists from across the country. The family trained, physically as well as mentally, for a month to participate in the adventure ride. “We are not big time into fitness activities but were passionate about participating in this expedition and trained for it in the city itself,” said Hasan Shafiq.

Batul and Fatema left no stone unturned to complete the expedition successfully. “I love sports and also exercise regularly. The enthusiastic participation by so many people made it really exciting and a thrilling experience,” said Batul. According to the family, Fatema was the youngest cyclist in the expedition to pedal the entire stretch on her own.

According to Hasan, they pedalled for a total of 573km. “Every day we would start at 7 in the morning, ride on an average 65km for almost 12 hours to reach the day’s destination before sunset,” he said. The Western Ghats terrain with its steep ups and downs presented challenges that would get tougher whenever the cyclists encountered heavy traffic while riding in the high temperature and humidity.

The family took utmost care to overcome fatigue and also kept with it tools needed to repair the bicycles in case of an emergency.

The tiring schedule was made charming by the beautiful view of nature that awaited them all along the route, the family said. The tough terrain became bearable thanks to the serene and mesmerizing coastline.

Apart from being physically demanding, the expedition required great mental strength and conviction. “As a mother I was equal parts nervous and excited for the trip. My daughters displayed true sportsman spirit. I am very proud of them,” said Sarah.

“We are really grateful to the entire team of YHAI for allowing us to participate in this expedition,” said Hasan.

The expedition was led by Santosh Shirke of Mumbai and Ramesh Kene was the chief coordinator and tour manager.

186,['7/01/2020'],Dehradun: Scam in payment of sanitation worker salaries,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Sanitation workers have often held protests over their wages getting stalled

DEHRADUN: Following complaints by several sanitation workers regarding untimely payment of salaries, mayor Sunil Uniyal Gama has asked all the 100 ward councillors in the city to submit the salary payment records of the sweepers working in their respective areas.

Last year, 635 sanitation workers were appointed and the responsibility to transfer their payment and maintain other records was given to the local ward councillors. Each sanitation worker was promised a salary of Rs 8,000 per month. However, many of them have not been receiving this amount regularly. Even though the DMC doesn’t possess records of these sanitation workers, it releases a cumulative salary amount which is put directly into the bank account of the ‘Mohalla Swachhta Samiti’, a body set up by ward councillors to improve sanitation of the city.

There have been allegations of mishandling of the DMC funds by ward councillors, many of whom it is alleged are not transferring the due amount to the accounts of sanitary workers. It is also alleged that the exact number of sanitary workers in each area have not been properly communicated by the councillors to the DMC.

When queried on the issue, ward councillors denied the allegations. “Not even a single ward councillor in the city is mishandling salaries of sanitation workers. We have proper salary records of all the sanitation workers in our respective wards. The salaries of sanitation workers are being transferred regularly to their bank accounts,” claimed Amita Singh, councillor from Balliwala ward.

Dheeraj Bharti, secretary of Akhil Bhartiya Safai Mazdoor Sangh, the body representing the sanitation workers meanwhile said, “It is not certain if any of the ward councillors is involved in mishandling of funds, but we feel that DMC should transfer the amount directly into the bank accounts of sanitary workers rather than sending it into the account of Mohalla Swacchta Samiti. That would be a more transparent thing to do.”

A girl raises slogans at the anti-CAA stir organised by an NGO at Chepauk on Monday.

CHENNAI: At least 10 children were used as pawns on Monday during the protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register for Citizens (NRC) organised by NGO Makkal Athikaram .

The protesters, who encouraged their children to raise slogans and wield placards, refused to prove they were their parents or legal guardians. Police, who took the children away, threatened to hand them over to a children’s home if their parents did not reveal more information. Police said it sought help from the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) during the operation but CWC members said they weren’t informed.

The organisation, which planned a rally towards the Secretariat, changed its venue to Chepauk after police blocked Kamarajar Salai.

Around 750 members of Makkal Athikaram then sat on protest near the Chepauk Guest House, blocking vehicular movement from Bells Road Junction on Wallajah Road towards University of Madras. They raised slogans against the central and state governments. Police detained the protesters at marriage halls and corporation community centres.

Police said they called CWC and asked them to take away the children. The agitation went on for nearly four hours before the protesters were arrested.

“Everyone who was arrested gave their address as Makkal Athikaram state office, #4, Maduravoyal, Chennai. We did not know where to issue summons to the agitators while moving the court. Also, we were not able to verify the details of the children. We thought they will reveal their address if we hold back the kids. So we wanted to hand them over to the CWC as per rules,” said police inspector Mohandas. But CWC members refused to take them, he said. Police said frisking members also did not help.

CWC member Isabel R told TOI that the committee was not intimated about the children. Later, when police released the protesters, they demanded that the children should also be sent with them. “We did send them away,” police said.

People, mostly students, raise slogans on the SPPU campus and on Fergusson College Road against the violence a... Read More

PUNE: The anger over Sunday’s attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students and teachers spilled onto the roads and educational campuses in the city on Monday.

Members of students’ organisations, social outfits and civil society groups came out to protest the assault on JNU pupils and teachers. The Aniket canteen at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) became the central rallying point of the protesters.

One group of the protesters blamed the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and, in turn, BJP for the attack on the JNU students. The other group of protesters was of the ABVP’s city unit, which blamed the JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) for the violence.

The biggest protest of the day was seen at SPPU’s Aniket canteen, where around 500 students and members of the civil society groups gathered around 7pm and raised slogans against the ABVP for the JNU violence.

“The Delhi police come under the Union home ministry, of which Amit Shah is in charge. This means he is also responsible for the attack on the JNU students and teachers,” former inspector general of police (Maharashtra) S M Mushrif said.

Minister of state Vishwajit Kadam said, “These people are afraid of democracy and free speech. Students are living in an environment of fear. Let me assure you as a minister of this state that nobody can touch you (students) in this land of Shivaji-Phule-Shahu-Ambedkar.”

On Monday morning, around 20 ABVP supporters staged a protest in front of Aniket canteen and blamed leftist groups for the JNU violence. “ABVP did not spread violence on the JNU campus. Rather, the left wing students’ union attacked ABVP students. Over 20 students, who are ABVP members, were injured and admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The Delhi police should punish the guilty,” said Dayanand Shinde, ABVP president at SPPU.

Around 5pm, members of several organisations gathered at the district collectorate under the banner of “Hum Bharat ke log”. Besides students from various educational institutes, the rally was attended by representatives of the Rashtra Seva Dal, Yuvak Kranti Dal (Yukrand) Poona College, Samyak Vidyarthi Andolan, All India Democratic Women’s Association) and the Students’ Federation of India to express their solidarity with the JNU students.

Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) students, who started their agitation from Sunday night, also protested on Monday. Some students took part in the demonstration outside the collectorate, while others joined a march from the FTII’s Law College Road campus to the Aniket canteen in the evening.

Another group of FTII students staged a protest outside Cafe Goodluck on Fergusson College Road, which was largely organized by social organization Lokayat and saw a turnout of nearly 200 people.

“On Tuesday, we will organize a march from FTII to the SPPU grounds, for which we have permission from the Pune police,” FTII Students Association general secretary Rajorshi Majumder said.

CM Naveen Patnaik

BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Monday condemned the violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University ( JNU ) in New Delhi and demanded action against the culprits.

“Shocked to know about the violent #JNUattack. Violence has no space in democracy and such attacks on students must be condemned unequivocally. Appeal law enforcement agencies to take swift action to apprehend the culprits and wish the injured students a speedy recovery,” Naveen tweeted.

Leaders across political divide condemned the incident in which masked miscreants attacked students and teachers of JNU.

Terming the attack as heinous, BJD spokesperson Sasmit Patra said, “The university administration and police must take strong steps to arrest the culprits and ensure a safe and secure ecosystem for students at JNU.”

BJD’s Amar Patnaik wondered, “How such organised violence could not be prevented in the national capital of an emerging super power!”

Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee president Niranjan Patnaik said the planned attack on JNU is meant to suppress its autonomy and pursuit of intellectual freedom. “It is highly condemnable & shameful. It is a matter of grave concern that fascist forces want to de-democratize India through violence. Every Indian must stand up against it,” he said.

Addressing a news conference here, Congress leader Debasis Patnaik termed the attack as ‘government sponsored.’ “The BJP leadership is unwilling to accept any democratic voice of dissent. The attack in JNU after a similar incident in Jamia Milia Islamia shows country’s democracy is in serious danger,” Debasis said.

Members of the All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) put up a demonstration in front of Rama Devi Women’s University expressing their anguish against the JNU attack. “The JNU violence was perpetrated to crush the countrywide protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act and plan for National Register of Citizens,” a statement issued by AIDSO Bhubaneswar city committee said. CPI activists staged a demonstration holding placards blaming ABVP for the attack while the ABVP blamed the Left for it.

State BJP vice-president Sameer Mohanty said the police investigation will reveal the truth. “The violence is condemnable. However, instead of indulging in a blame-game, one should wait for the investigation findings. The academic glory must be restored.”

Haridwar: Residents have complained that meat shops continue to operate in the city and slaughter animals in the open, in defiance of an Uttarakhand high court (HC) order passed last year, and that the district administration and police have failed to take action against them.

The HC in its order had said meat should be procured only from licensed slaughterhouses, and no animal should be slaughtered in individual meat shops in the district. Yet, several meat shops where animal are slaughtered are being run in the Haridwar municipal area and adjoining places.

Activist J P Badoni told TOI that despite the HC ban on slaughter of animals for meat in shops in residential area of the district, police, municipal and food safety authorities haven’t taken action against the rule breakers.

However, Haridwar police claimed they had asked meat shop owners to procure meat only from authorised slaughterhouses. SSP Haridwar Senthil Abudai Krishna Raj S said, “Food safety department and municipal authority are responsible for giving permits and checking status. We just give NOC regarding law and order. We have alerted meat shop owners not to slaughter animals inside their shops.”

Food safety officials said their department has given permission to just six meat shops to sell chicken, that too, after procuring meat from authorised slaughterhouses.

Food safety officer Kapil Dev told TOI, “Slaughtering animals in meat shops was banned by Nainital high court. We have handed out only six licenses to sell meat, keep regular check on these shops time to time and take strict action against law breakers.”

However, a survey by TOI found that several other shops are being run illegally where animals are slaughtered in the open. With no slaughterhouse in Haridwar district, meat sellers have to buy from ones in western UP. This raises their overheads, which is why they are slaughtering animals on their own.

Nagpur: Trolled and targeted by opposition for “money in pockets” remark, state women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur said she was only repeating the words of a former BJP state president and those were “sarcastic in nature”. Thakur was speaking on Saturday in Washim while campaigning for zilla parishad elections to be held on Tuesday.

In a video that went viral, Thakur allegedly told voters that “they (Maha Vikas Aghadi ministers) had just taken oath and their pockets are yet to be filled up”. “The pockets of BJP leaders are full. If they approach voters’ homes with Laxmi (money), don’t say no to them. But ensure that you will vote for panja (Congress symbol),” she said in her speech.

According to BJP activists, party neta Kirit Somaiyya lodged a complaint with the state election commission (SEC) claiming Thakur was instigating people to indulge in corrupt practices.

On Monday, Thakur told TOI: “It was just an election rally where I was quoting the BJP leader without naming him. It was a tongue-in-cheek comment but the BJP has blown it out of proportion.”

Accusing the BJP of targeting her, the Teosa MLA said, “I was indirectly targeting a ZP president who was sitting with other people in the audience. He’s highly corrupt. I was reminding the ZP president and voters of what the state BJP president had said and it was sort of an informal conversation with them. These are all opposition’s tactics to divert the attention from main problems plaguing the nation.”

Stating that she was an upcoming face of the Congress, the daughter of former MLA Bhaiyyasaheb Thakur, charged BJP of “not respecting women”. “How many women netas do you see in the assembly? Is it really good to troll them when you talked about equality? The opposition is misleading people by spreading rumours. My intent was never wrong, it was in jest,” she said.

Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis also targeted Thakur, without naming her directly, during campaigning for ZP polls in Nagpur. “This government is not formed for governance, but for filling up of their coffers at the exchequer’s expense. One of their ministers stated that as they were sworn in recently, they would need time to fill up pockets, and therefore can’t offer money to voters,” he said.

Nainital: In a somewhat unusual submission before the Uttarakhand high court (HC), the Haridwar district administration said that it is not able to open a sugar godown because it has been filled to the brim.

The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma while hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) had directed the Haridwar district magistrate on December 13 to assess the quantity of sugar in the godown. The administration in its reply to court said, “Godown has been filled to the brim with sugar bags and the officials are not in a position to enter the godown for physical verification.”

The PIL filed by Haridwar resident Nitin has raised the issue of high-level mismanagement and misappropriation of public money by a sugar mill in Roorkee area of Haridwar district.

Speaking to TOI, the petitioner said that the mill has siphoned off farmers’ money and has taken loans fraudulently by telling the banks that the sugar in its godown is owned by them. “The government, in December 2018, made the DM receiver of the sugar mill as it had not made payments to the farmers for the season 2017-18. The main purpose of appointing DM as receiver was to make payments to farmers from the sale,” the petition read.

The petitioner told the court that despite more than a year passing since the DM was appointed receiver, the auction is yet to take place and over Rs 200 crore of almost 15,000 farmers is still due.

After this, the court ordered the DM to assess the quantity of the sugar in mill and auction and thereafter file a compliance report before February 10 when the case will be heard next.

""Allow some clarity to emerge...it's always better to operate when there's clarity about the investment environment,"" he added.Choksey believes that since Iran is already under economic and trade sanctions imposed by the US, not much of its oil is coming into the global market.However, what could change this situation is if Iran blocks the Strait of Hormuz - one of the world's most important sea passages through which about a fourth of global crude is shipped, said another broker. Investment advisers too believe that it's difficult to pinpoint for how long the current geopolitical tensions could continue and how it could end.""The main factor that is currently pulling the Indian market down has its origin outside the country. So it's difficult to predict when it could end and how,"" said Arun Kejriwal, director of investment advisory firm KRIS. Kejriwal also believes that once the current volatility subsides, small and midcap stocks, which witnessed lacklustre trades during the past several months, could be the sectors to watch out for.Brokers also believe that foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), who pumped over $14 billion into Indian stocks in 2019 and nearly $20 billion across all assets classes - including debt and hybrid instruments - may not be in a hurry to take money out of the country. However, among the various types of foreign investors, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to be the first to sell in a major way in case the slide continues for some more time. On Monday, the sensex and Nifty both lost nearly 2% each.Investment advisers also said that in case an investor has extra cash to invest, he should put the same either in savings bank account, short-term FDs or liquid funds. They also said that if an investor already has a financial plan in place and has been investing according to that to reach life's financial goals, investments under such plans should not be stopped or changed just because the market has turned volatile.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73133534,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-41735,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/retail-investors-should-avoid-kneejerk-reaction-experts/articleshow/73130632.cms

196,['7/01/2020'],Vijayvargiya will be arrested as soon as police probe is over: Minister,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Kolkata, Sep 25 (ANI): BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya holds ektara and poses with the artists during a devoti... Read More

Bhopal: Trouble seems to deepen for BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya. A minister of the Kamal Nath government said on Monday that the BJP leader could soon be arrested for “threatening to set Indore on fire”.

“Vijayvargiya will be arrested after police complete their investigation,” minister for cooperatives Dr Govind Singh told mediapersons in Gwalior. “The law will take its course and punitive action will be taken for the threat to set Indore on fire. Investigation is not yet complete. Some more statements will be recorded and several new sections will be added to the case. Once all this process is over, arrest will follow. This government is not so weak that it cannot arrest Kailash Vijayvargiya,” he added. On Sunday, police registered cases against Vijayvargiya and 350 BJP workers for allegedly threatening government officials.

Referring to the infamous pension scam that the state government plans to reinvestigate, Singh asked Vijayvargiya to “look inward, at his conscience”. “I want to ask Kailash Vijayvargiya, what was the golden tree he planted that today he has property and assets worth crores of rupees? Lakhs of poor persons, who needed pension, were deprived of it. The scam occurred during Vijayvargiya’s tenure as mayor of Indore. The committee that probed the scam found him guilty. This government will again investigate the irregularities.”

Unfazed, Vijayvargiya said, “I have seen police stations and jails before, so I am not anxious. Those who haven’t experience of police and jails may be afraid. I have been in Mamata Banerjee’s jail in West Bengal and continue to fight there. So, what are Madhya Pradesh prisons in comparison? Hum sarkar ka galat aacharan ka virodh karte rahenge (I will keep opposing the government’s wrongdoings).”

On Sunday, despite the firestorm over his ‘nahin to Indore mein aag laga deta’ remark, Vijayvargiya had allegedly said, “Eeit se eeit baja dunga (will decimate the Kamal Nath government).”

In response, PCC spokesman and CM Kamal Nath’s media convener Narendra Saluja tweeted, “Kailash Vijayvargiyaji, how will you take on the Kamal Nath government? You just keep counting the falling bricks of the mafia. No poor person is affected, only the mafia is shaken. And you, as their advocator, keep counting their falling bricks and thereafter, set fire to the bricks of Indore.”

State Congress media department vice-president Abhay Dubey said, “The erstwhile government was BJP’s, and mafia gathered strength during that time. If Kailash Vijayvargiya wants to remain a leader of the mafia, then he has no right to be a people’s leader. He was silent on the Kamal Nath government’s action against mafia until his own people came in the firing line. And then, Vijayvargiya started shouting. Everyone is equal before the law and Madhya Pradesh will be rid of mafia.”

197,['7/01/2020'],Two city labs to study Lakshadweep coast,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Chennai: After mapping the entire mainland of India for vulnerability to erosion and implementing measures to restore disappearing beaches, city scientists have now turned their attention to Lakshadweep islands.

Researchers from two city laboratories — National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR) and National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) — are now mapping the shorelines of the slowly eroding islands of Lakshadweep to come up with an intervention. Lakshadweep has 36 small islands.

“The coastal erosion in Lakshadweep is moderate. But if we do not act now, it will worsen,” said M V Ramana Murthy, director, NCCR, on the sidelines of a two-day workshop on Monday. The workshop organised by NIOT was on regional framework for coastal vulnerability towards the safety, security and sustainable development of member states in the Indian Ocean. “We are preparing a shoreline management plan based on which we will come up with an environment friendly solution and deploy devices. Only a few places may have artificial reefs,” he added.

Researchers said the shoreline management plan will have comprehensive data on the changes along the shoreline of the group of islands as well as sand movement and wave activity. As a first step, NIOT director M A Atmanand said bathymetry (study of underwater depth) studies have been completed.

Research vessel Sagar Manjusha was deployed to conduct the first round of studies in the deep sea around the islands. Another vessel Sagar Tara along with help from fishing trawlers is being used for shallow water survey.

“Erosion is mainly due to climate change besides construction of structures along the coast ,” the NCCR director said.

The labs had provided solutions to eroding coasts in Puduchery, where a massive steel caisson was deployed closer to the coast, and Kadalur villages located near Kalpakkam, where dykes were submerged near the coast, to reduce wave activity. “We may have an intervention similar to Kadalur in Lakshadweep,” Atmanand said.

“We prepared a coastal vulnerability index for our country and have shared it with the state government. This index will help in deciding specific areas along the coast to focus on or alert during the events instead of the entire region,” he said.

The NIOT director said following the workshop, a document to guide other member states in the Indian Ocean on the methodology to be adopted to prepare coastal vulnerability index, which will help in decision making during events that may affect the coast. The document will be submitted to Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission for dissemination to other member states.

The protesters also demanded immediate arrest of those who thrashed the students and teachers at JNU and vandalised the university.With banners and posters in hand, the students along with members of various NGOs staged protest at the city’s Gandhi park raising slogans and also burnt the effigy of the central government. The protesters demanded the intervention of President Ram Nath Kovind in the matter and urged him to have the issue probed by a non-governmental organisation to ensure an unbiased inquiry.Himanshu Chauhan from SFI said, “The worst part is how the Delhi police remained totally silent throughout the violence. The JNU administration has shamelessly blamed the left and democratic organisations for the attack which reminds one of the Reichstag fire incident during Nazi Germany. This is an attempt to terrorise the ongoing wave of people’s resistance against the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens & National Population Register, which is being led by the student community all over the country. JNU has always been a centre of resistance, hence it is being targeted.”Spokesperson of J&K Students’ Association Nasir Khuehami who was present during the protests said, “We strongly condemn the attack on JNU students and the students’ union president Aishe Ghosh.

SHRIRAM VERNEKAR

Amravati: Bachhu Kadu, four-time MLA from Achalpur, continues to flaunt his aggressive style of politicking even after becoming a state minister in Maharashtra government for the first time.

Kadu, minister of state for irrigation, school education, women and child welfare, labour and OBCs, expressed his resolve to serve the people by sitting outside Mantralaya, the power centre of the state government in Mumbai, even if he doesn’t get a chamber there as a minister. “If there are complaints that people’s issues are not being resolved in the Mantralaya, I will sit outside and ensure justice to them,” Kadu said.

Talking to reporters at circuit house here, Kadu, MLA for four consecutive terms from 2004 to 2019, said he got more than expected in the form of ministries and believed that justice could be done to people even without a chamber or a government bungalow.

“I did not demand any specific portfolio, but it was my desire to get social justice department as I wanted to serve differently-abled persons and the poor. Normally, nobody demands this department, but I got many other departments too and it would be my endeavour to solve the problems of the people through the ministries allotted,” Kadu said.

Stating that irrigation issues concerning Vidarbha and Marathwada have become serious problems due to non-completion of many projects or due to non-supply of water to farmers even after completion of projects, Kadu said efforts are now needed to take water directly to the farms.

Kadu, who is known for his unique style of agitations including the Sholay-styled overhead water tank stir, reaffirmed his commitment to the people. “I will not hesitate in praising and felicitating good officers, but if they shirk from their duty, I will not hesitate in showing them their place,” Kadu said.

“Officers indulging in delaying tactics must be dealt with sternly,” Kadu said, adding, “I will not mind losing my ministry if erring officers punished by me take out morchas against me. My commitment lies with the people.”

Pune: The Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) state unit has in a statement condemned the “attack on doctors and nurses” by some unidentified people while they were giving first aid to students injured in Sunday’s violence on the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus.

“The situation in the country smacks of anarchy and the breakdown of law and order is complete. That the doctors and nurses are unsafe in the national capital speaks volumes about the governance and lack of it,” IMA-Maharashtra president Avinash Bhondwe said on Monday. “IMA reiterates its stand that doctors and nurses have the right of way to treat the injured and everyone has the right to life and access to care,” he said.

The IMA said in the statement that the health services personnel and clinical establishments (Prohibition of Violence and Damage to Property) bill, 2019, was drafted, seeking punishment for people assaulting doctors and other healthcare professionals on duty. “The bill had proposed a jail term of up to 10 years, but was dismissed by the home ministry,” it stated.

Representative image

LUCKNOW: Come Monday, government primary schools in Uttar Pradesh will hold their first ever parent-teacher meeting (PTM). Usually confined to private schools, it is for the first time that PTMs have been made compulsory in government schools in the state.

“With regular PTMs, the government wants to raise bar of primary schools in UP,” said an official. “It’s a platform where teachers and parents can discuss their child’s performance, his/her behaviour. Regular interactions help in better relationships, too,” said a teacher.

According to an order in this regard, teachers will apprise parents about children’s attendance and their continuous, comprehensive and evaluated progress reports. They will also be made aware of the technological advancements being implemented to improve the standard of primary education. The government also wants parents to know about the various free facilities given to their children like books, socks and shoes, sweater, uniforms, school bags and mid-day meals. In addition, parents will be apprised about the various health check-ups, besides knowing about their child’s learning outcomes.

The order by additional chief secretary, basic education, Renuka Kumar, states that PTMs are a way to encourage discussions between teachers and parents, the two main stakeholders. Through PTMs, parents will also come to know about their child’s behaviour and activities like setting up of kitchen gardens, eco club, nutrition and hand-washing campaigns.

The government is also keen to know from parents about the school’s academic atmosphere and also imparting quality education. Teachers have been asked to motivate parents to inculcate moral values and habit of cleanliness and hygiene in their child.

The order makes it compulsory for all teachers to be present in the PTMs, to be held once in three months — January, April, July and October — between 11 am to 12 noon. The PTMs will be held on second Monday of these months. In case of a holiday, the PTM should be held the next working day, reads the order. Principals and school caretakers have been instructed to send a notice in written to the parents two days before the PTM is scheduled, the order adds.

203,['7/01/2020'],EOW seeks details of pepper scam involving NCDEX from Betul firm,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Representative image

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh EOW has summoned directors of Betul Oil Limited with documents pertaining to their allegations against Mumbai-based National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), in connection with the ‘2012-black pepper scam’.

In December 2012, Food Safety Standard Authority (FSSAI) had sealed six NCDEX-accredited warehouses in Kerala’s Alappuzha and Kochi after samples were found coated with carcinogenic oils and paraffin. Directors of Betul Oil claim that their pepper worth Rs 72 cr got stuck due to cheating and have accused NCDEX of breaching their trust. Sources say, pepper worth nearly Rs 300 cr is locked up in the warehouses of NCDEX, seized by FSSAI and there are many traders who are facing similar troubles like Betul Oil.

EOW Bhopal had received a complaint from M/s Betul Oil Limited, Industrial Area Kosmi, and Betul through their company secretary Abhinaya Kulkarni a month ago.

In April 2004 the NCDEX allowed trading of “Malabar Garbled 1 Pepper” on its trading platform. Garbled peppers are processed ones for direct human consumption. In January 2012, NCDEX put around 6,300 MT processed pepper on sale. Betul Oil had purchased 1729.919 MT of black pepper for Rs 72.26 crore from this trading platform. Purchase was made through brokers and agents who were members of NCDEX.

A few days later, Betul Oil came to know through media that NCDEX accredited warehouses has been sealed by FSSAI following stocks containing inferior quality of pepper. With around Rs 72 cr at stake, company officials wrote a letter to Food Safety Commissioner, Trivandrum on November 17, 2012 requesting to conduct sample testing of pepper stored with National Collateral Management Services Limited and JICS Logistics Limited.

The complainant also requested NCDEX to provide samples of stocks of pepper stored in the warehouse. On receipt, the samples were tested at FSSAI approved Sterling Test House and Export Inspection Agency, which found the pepper to be contaminated with mineral oil. NCDEX would have delivered adulterated pepper had the stock not been sealed by FSSAI authorities in Kerala, say EOW officials. FSSAI had even ordered to destroy adulterated pepper but NCEDX moved court for a stay. Eight years on, disposal of seized peppers is yet to be decided.

EOW has put several senior officials of NCDEX under scanner including the then MD and DEO and officials of National Collateral Management Services Limited (NCMSL) for allegedly procuring adulterated black pepper and placing the stock issuing false quality certificate, thus causing undue loss to several companies including M/s Betul Oil Limited and other companies. “NCDEX was under obligation to ensure and check quality and grade of commodities besides being accountable for proper deposit and delivery of commodities. It a case of breach of trust and cheating,” said an EOW officer.

Warehouse service is provided by NCMSL and JICS Logistics Limited, and they accept commodities from the sellers and depositors on the certification issues by the Assayer i.e. NCMSL. Thus, only the goods which meet the standards prescribed in the contract are to be accepted in the warehouses, said the officer adding all those involved would be brought to book.

204,['7/01/2020'],Odisha open to Ayushman scheme if 2 riders met: Min,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Bhubaneswar: The state government has for the first time clearly indicated that it is willing to embrace the Centre’s flagship national health scheme ‘ Ayushman Bharat’ provided its conditions are met.

Health minister Naba Kishore Das on Monday said the state government has put forward two conditions to the Centre based on which it will take a call on merging its own Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana (BSKY), launched in August 2018, with the central healthcare scheme.

“The state government has asked the Centre to consider two suggestions for the merger of BSKY and Ayushman Bharat. First, the Centre should not insist on Aadhar for treatment at government hospitals. Second, all 70 lakh families currently covered under BSKY be included in Ayushman Bharat. The Centre is yet to respond. Once the Centre replies, we are open to examine it and take a decision,” Das said, adding, “The ball is in the Centre’s court.”

Under the proposed parameters, around 63 lakh families would be covered under the central scheme. State health department sources said the state has sent at least three communications to the Union health ministry regarding its suggestions to implement Ayushman Bharat.

Union petroleum minister and state BJP leader Dharmendra Pradhan, who was in Bhubaneswar on Monday, said the state should shun its apprehensions and join the central scheme in larger public interest. Earlier, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, during his visit here on December 25, had urged Naveen to implement the central scheme.

Speculation is rife about the merger of BSKY and Ayushman Bharat ever since the state government announced the convergence of its cash assistance scheme for farmers Kalia with the central PM KISAN scheme, apparently due to financial constraints. The BJP-BJD bonhomie after the Lok Sabha polls is being given out as another reason behind such speculations.

Sources said the state has spent more than Rs 700 crore under BSKY in the past one year and is looking to reduce its financial burden by merging it with the central scheme. In Ayushman Bharat, the cost is shared in the ratio of 60:40 by the Centre and the states (for states like Odisha). The state promises annual health cover of Rs 5 lakh to eligible families and Rs 10 lakh for women members of the families.

Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee president Niranjan Patnaik said Naveen used BSKY to win elections and after victory, he sees no reason to spend on it exploring possibilities to merge it with the central scheme.

205,['7/01/2020'],Smog engulfs Trichy city as garbage burns everywhere,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Trichy: Be it city roads or national highways passing through the city, waste mounds dumped by corporation workers and the public along the roads in the city are periodically set on fire causing smog to engulf the city neighbourhoods every morning.

Ever since the garbage bins placed on the public spots were removed by the corporation in the last two years, public littering has drastically increased to all parts of the city. Vacant plots and spaces along the roads remain an easy target for commercial establishments and residents to dump their waste including plastic litters because of slackness in door-to-door waste collection.

As the waste accumulated in vacant lands are seldom cleared, the easy way out for sanitary workers to get rid of it is to set them on fire, locals said. “Ponmalaipatti road connecting Ponmalai with Trichy-Pudukkottai National Highways witnesses smog completely covering the road daily. Waste accumulated on the vacant plots are persistently set on fire, causing the air quality to take a plunge,” said K C Neelamegam, Trichy based environmentalist.

The problem of burning the waste mound at will is not restricted to a particular locality but is widespread in all four zones including Karumandapam, Crawford, Cantonment, Palpannai and E Pudur. Even the vacant space adjacent to the Trichy-Chennai and Trichy-Dindigul national highways in the city are not spared.

Sources said that the waste mounds were set on fire by sanitary workers as they are not interested in transporting the waste to micro compost centres since it involves segregating the waste manually. Sanitary workers have been blamed for picking only plastic waste as it can be traded for a price, while other wastes are burnt near roads.

As such burning of waste will take a toll among the residents having respiratory ailments, locals urged the civic body to take action against the perpetrators. “We will inquire into the incidents. Sanitary workers were already told not to burn waste on roads,” a sanitary inspector with Trichy Corporation said.

PUNE: A car parked near a blind turn on Pune-Panshet Road without switching on its hazard lights cost two bike-borne friends their lives on Sunday evening.

The duo — Prathamesh Ramdas Mate (21) and Akshay Dhananjy Jori (21) from Khadakwasla — went to the other side of the road to go ahead of the stationary car. At the same time, an MSRTC bus came from the opposite side. In an attempt to avoid crashing into the bus, the one riding the bike applied sudden brakes. The two-wheeler skidded and hit the car. The duo fell on the road.

Mate and Jori died because of severe head injuries. “They were not wearing helmets,” said assistant inspector Nitin Nam of the Haveli police.

The police have registered an offence against the car’s driver for causing the deaths due to negligence.

On Sunday, Jori and Mate had gone to the former’s native village near Panshet. They were returning home late in the evening via Pune-Panshet Road. There was traffic on the road. “A group of people, who had gone to Panshet in a rented car, were also returning to Pune around the same time. When they reached near Khanapur , around 22km from the city, their car developed a technical snag,” he said.

The driver stopped the car on the road, just before a blind turn. “The driver did not switch on any hazard warning lights or indicators to alert other drivers,” Nam said.

Jori and Mate reached near the snag-hit car around 6.30pm. In an attempt to cross it, they went to the other side of the road. At the same time an MSRTC bus on Swargate-Panshet route came from the opposite side.

“To avoid crashing into the bus, the motorcycle rider applied the brakes all of a sudden. The bike skidded and crashed into the parked car,” Nam said. Jori and Mate fell and suffered severe head injuries, he said.

The residents of the area rushed them to a nearby hospital, where the doctors pronounced them dead, the assistant inspector said. “The car driver caused the accident. He should have switched on the hazard lights or indicators,” he said, adding that their probe was on.

Trichy: The Perambalur police arrested a police constable attached to the Armed Reserve (AR) wing in Perambalur late on Sunday on charges of cheating a couple of men.

Perambalur district crime branch police arrested Chandramohan, 39, serving at AR based on a complaint from A Bharathiraja, 27, of Perambalur. The police said that Chandramohan reportedly had a stake in a restaurant run by Bharathiraja and Sathishkumar at Thanneerpandhal in Perambalur on the Trichy- Chennai national highway.

According to the complaint, an issue cropped between the partners of the restaurant, during which Chandramohan stole the car, bike and cash Rs 1 lakh from Bharathiraja and escaped. Bharathiraja’s attempts to get back his properties went in vain as Chandramohan allegedly refused to return them.

Trichy: Tension prevailed for a while near Ariyamangalam flyover on Monday as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) workers removed a few tree saplings planted along the Trichy-Thanjavur National Highway. NHAI authorities reasoned that the saplings would disturb the stability of the flyover when they grow.

Sources said that youths belonging to Thiruverumbur locality a few months back had planted several native tree saplings near the bridge. The saplings were provided protection and maintained by the youths as part of their efforts to increase the city’s green cover.

Representatives of NHAI toll plaza on Trichy-Thanjavur NH claimed that they had intimated the locals to remove the saplings voluntarily. “Owing to safety concerns, we already informed the locals to remove the four to five saplings planted very close to the flyover. Since the saplings were not removed, our workers removed them,” an official source said. On coming to know about NHAI’s move on Monday, the locals argued with the toll plaza staff against the action.

However, as officials made it clear that the saplings can be planted in other places, in a manner not causing any threat to the bridge, locals dispersed from the spot. “We are not against the tree plantation drive, but the saplings should be planted in a proper place,” the official added.

MEERUT: Leader of opposition in the UP’s legislative assembly Ram Govind Chaudhry opened a scathing attack on the ruling BJP over the violence against the backdrop of protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act on December 20. “I have been saying this from the beginning and will say it over and over again. BJP and police did this to defame the ongoing movement,” SP leader Chaudhary said.

He was leading a delegation of party which met with the family members of the deceased who were killed during the violent protests. A cheque of Rs 5 lakh was handed over to each of the family members of the five deceased. Six people had died during the protests in Meerut and cheques were handed over to five families, all residents of minority-dominated Lisari Gate area.

“BJP does not have faith on either Constitution or democracy. If they had any faith, they would not have used such stunts to bring misery on people,” Chaudhary said.

210,['7/01/2020'],Bijnor: Cane farmers to stage protests in spite of section 144,"This story is from January 7, 2020

The sugar mills in the state already owe Rs 4,000 crore to 40 lakh farmers Uttar Pradesh

BIJNOR: With section 144 of CrPC imposed across Uttar Pradesh in view of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests, sugarcane farmers have not staged protests against non-payment of dues by sugar mills though harvesting has begun. Crushing will continue till April.

Now, farmer organizations have decided to resume their agitation, pointing out that they have nothing to do with the CAA protests. While the Azad Kisan Union has announced a “jail bharo andolan” on January 10 in Bijnor, Bharatiya Kisan Union has called for a panchayat on January 9.

The sugar mills in the state already owe Rs 4,000 crore to 40 lakh farmers across the state for the current crushing season, which commenced in October. In addition, mills owe Rs 2,000 crore as dues for the previous (2018-19) crushing season. Farmers are also unhappy as the state government has not revised SAP (state advised price) for the past two years.

There are 119 sugar mills in the state and so far, they have crushed around 3,500 lakh quintal sugarcane in current crushing season.

According to data available with the cane department here, mills have paid Rs 4,107 crore to farmers – this accounts for 50% of dues to farmers. As per norms, mills have to clear the dues within 14 days of the delivery of produce to sugar units. But mills have failed to do so. Besides, many mills are yet to clear last year’s outstanding dues, which is around Rs 2,017 crore.

Now, Azad Kisan Union has announced its decision to launch an agitation. Talking with TOI, national president of Azad Kisan Union Rajendra Singh, said, “SAP has not been hiked for the past two years. The prices have neither been increased nor dues are being cleared on time.”

Singh said, “In Bijnor district, three mills -- Bilai, Bijnor and Chandpur -- have not paid a single penny for the current season. They have even failed to clear last year’s dues.”

He further stated, “Administration had imposed section 144 in the state. We will launch our agitation. There is no way left for us. We will march to the collectorate on January 10 and launch a ‘jail bharo andolan’ to press for payment of pending dues. We are ready to go to jail.”

Bharatiya Kisan Union’s district president Digambar Singh said, “We will hold a panchayat on January 9 here in Bijnor and chalk out plans for the agitation. Many mills have failed to clear the dues. The Power Corporation is also disconnecting connections to farmers for failing to pay their electricity bills. Farmers are facing lot of financial hardships.”

Police have arrested the trafficker and six others

MEERUT: The deal was struck at Rs 75,000, and the highest bidder was delighted. The girl, just 16, still dazed and bleeding from the fresh beating, was wondering where the life would take her now. Sitting inside a cramped room full of “buyers” and a notorious trafficker-- about 1,300km away from the village in Ranchi district where she grew up-- all she thought of was her mother, whose death a year ago changed it all. The step-mother allegedly sold her to Kalawati, 35, a trafficker who brought her to Bulandshahr a few days ago.

However, the fate had other plans.

Acting on a tip-off, police raided the house which was being used as a trafficking hub for the last several days and arrested Kalawati and six men, who had come to “purchase” the girl so that they could marry her.

Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Bulandshahr, Santosh Kumar Singh, said, “People from western UP and Haryana used to come here to purchase girls for the purpose of marriage.

“In this case, six persons had gathered at the house in city’s Ahmedgarh area on Friday. Following a tip-off, a raid was conducted. The minor girl who was rescued has been sent for medical examination and was later produced before magistrate.”

According to sources in police, the girl was being “auctioned” and several buyers had come for bidding. “She was sold for Rs 75,000 to one of the buyers from Bulandshahr’s Khurja area,” a police officer told TOI, on condition of anonymity. The copy of the FIR, which is with TOI, corroborated his claims.

Reacting to the development, Meerut IG (range) Alok Singh said, “We will share the investigation details with anti-human trafficking unit (AHTU) also for better coordination in the future.”

The girl was later taken to district child welfare committee (CWC) for counseling. “We have contacted CWC in Ranchi. Arrangements are being made to transfer the girl there. She will be rehabilitated there by the panel,” said Bhupendra Singh, a member of CWC in Bulandshahr.

“The area has become a hub for trafficking of girls and woman from states like Jharkhand and Bihar. They are sold to families, especially from western UP and Haryana seeking women for marriage due to skewed sex ratio,” the source said.

BHOPAL: While addressing a gathering of protesters sitting on a ‘ satyagraha ’ against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register ( NPR ) and the National Register Citizens at Bhopal’s Iqbal Maidan on Monday, former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan said that what happened at the campus of Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) “never even happened during emergency” and that for the first time, students and teachers of universities were being “thrashed inside the campuses”.

Gopinathan was referring to the Sunday evening attack by masked people on students and teachers on JNU campus .

“They are scared of only one thing: questions. They feel that if anyone asks any questions, then he or she should be silenced,” said the ex-IAS officer who had resigned following the revocation of Article 370 in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.

“If any student asks questions, then they are silenced by calling them ‘tukde tukde gang’. If any working-class person asks any questions, then they are silenced by being called ‘Urban Naxals’. If poor tribals ask questions, they are silenced by being labelled Maoists. If Muslims asks questions, they are silenced by being called terrorists”, he said.

Speaking on CAA, NRC and NPR, Gopinathan said, “There are three things. Firstly, they are anti-constitution, then they are anti-poor and then they are anti-Muslims.”

Urging the state government to refrain from conducting the NPR exercise, he said, “If the government have said that they are against CAA and NRC, then they should also not allow NPR.”

MEERUT: After a few days of clear weather, the winter chill made a comeback in Meerut. The city also experienced sporadic rainfall on Monday. The temperature here remained considerably low as the difference between maximum and minimum temperature dipped – even as minimum temperature was more than Sunday’s temperature.

“The maximum and minimum temperature recorded in Meerut on Monday were 15.2 degrees Celsius and 10.6 degrees Celsius, respectively. The maximum and minimum humidity levels recorded here on Monday were 82% and 78%, respectively. The city recorded 0.4mm of rainfall on Monday,” said Brij Mohan, meteorological in-charge, Meerut.

While the minimum temperature recorded here on Monday was higher than what was recorded on Sunday, the chill was more on Monday due to the lesser difference between maximum and minimum temperature.

On Sunday, the difference between maximum and minimum temperature was 9.6 degree Celsius as against Monday’s diurnal range of temperature (difference between maximum and minimum temperature) which was recorded at 4.6 degree Celsius.

“The diurnal range of temperature plays a major role in deciding how cold or warm the day will be. Monday was colder than Sunday because the difference between maximum and minimum temperature was lesser than Sunday. Rainfall is predicted in the coming days,” said Mohan.

MEERUT: Police have recovered Rs 2 lakh cash and huge amount of gold and silver jewellery belonging to Shamli-based Bhajan singer Ajay Pathak , who along and his wife and their two children were fpound murdered at their house on December 30. The recovery made from a flat in Santnagar in Delhi’s Burari area also included wallet, purse, expensive watches, laptop bag and luggage bags belonging to Pathak family.

“We have taken DNA samples of the accused, which would be matched with the ones collected from the spot. The recovery of the looted items was made from the rented flat in Delhi. The weapon used in the murders have also been recovered,” Adarsh Mandi SHO Karamveer Singh said.

Ajay, his wife Sneha Pathak (42) and daughter Vasundhra Pathak (16) were murdered with a sharp-edged weapon at their Shamli house on the night of December 30. Police said during interrogation, Himanshu Saini, a disciple of Ajay, confessed to have killed the entire family for not returning Rs 60,000 they owed to him. Himanshu alleged that he was insulted by Ajay every time he asked for his money.

The recovery was made after local police, which has formed an SIT to investigate the brutal murder of the family, secured four-day police custody of the accused, Himanshu. “The SIT made the recovery following interrogation inputs of the accused,” an official in Shamli police said.

Himanshu, was arrested by Haryana police on January 1. According to Panipat police, Himanshu was arrested when he was trying to flee after setting ablaze Pathak’s SUV which had his son's body in the rear seat. Police have sent the charred body for forensic and post-mortem examination.

Himanshu planned to dispose all the bodies. He first took Bhagwad’s body to Panipat. “But when he got to know that the news of the murders has spread, he set the car on fire and was trying to flee,” police had said.

LUCKNOW: Hearing the habeas corpus petition of an advocate who was allegedly arrested after the December 19 protest against the amendment in the citizenship law and National Register of Citizens in the city, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court has granted the UP government a week’s time to file an additional counter affidavit giving the exact time and place from where he was arrested and also the details of his production before the judicial magistrate in the civil court before sending him to jail under judicial custody.

A bench of Justice Shahibul Hasnain and Justice Virendra Kumar II passed the order on the petition moved on behalf of advocate Mohammad Shoaib through his next friend Gaurav Kumar Kashyap. On the previous hearing on January 3, the court had expressed concern when the additional government advocate (AGA) SP Singh was not able to assist the court properly for want of adequate instructions from the police.

The investigating officer Brijendra Kumar Mishra was also present, but the court found that even he was not able to give correct instructions to the AGA.

The petitioner had then alleged that his arrest is illegal as the time and manner shown by the police was incorrect and concocted. The petitioner even questioned the proceedings of judicial remand, alleging that he was never produced before a magistrate, rendering his custody illegal. It was also said in the petition that he was placed under house arrest on the night of December 18, which continued on December 19 and he was not allowed to venture out.

The petitioner’s lawyer, AB Solomon had then stated that the petitioner was never produced before any magistrate. “Had he been produced before a magistrate, the time and place of the court would have been captured in CCTV cameras that cover the entire campus for surveillance”, he had said.

Expressing concern on the petitioner’s argument, the court had then directed the AGA to come prepared on this issue in the next hearing.

When the matter came up on Monday, the AGA vehemently opposed the contentions of the petitioner that his custody was illegal. He placed records showing that the petitioner was properly produced for the judicial custody before being sent to jail.

“The other accused persons in the case are getting bail, but Shoaib has not done the same because of ulterior motive and to sensationalise the matter unnecessarily,” argued the AGA. He also sought time to file additional affidavit in this regard to which the court agreed.

BIJNOR: Hours after a leopard killed a 14-year-old boy at Bhogpur village in Bijnor ’s Najibabad tehsil, enraged villagers shot dead the animal after cordoning off a sugarcane field on Monday. Armed with guns, they combed the cane field, found the leopard and killed it. Then they dragged the carcass up to the village.

Since November 27, six persons, including the teenager, have been killed in leopard attacks in the district. A leopardess is hiding for the past 10 days in the sugarcane fields near Mohandiya village in Bijnor tehsil, 30 km from for the spot where the leopard was killed, and is said to have killed three people in the area.

After learning about the leopard’s killing, senior officials, including DM Ramakant Pandey, Najibabad SDM Sangita and SP (city) Lakshmi Nivas Mishra reached the village with a large number of policemen. While the boy’s body was sent to the district hospital for autopsy, a post-mortem was also carried out on the leopard.

Talking to TOI, Najibabad divisional forest officer Manoj Kumar Shukla said, “The leopard killed Prashant Kumar (14) of Bhogpur village. Later, villagers shot the big cat dead. The boy’s family will be given Rs 5 lakh as compensation.”

SP (city) Mishra said, “A case will be registered in this connection based on the complaint of forest authorities.”

According to officials, Prashant Kumar, son of Jai Prakash, was a class VII student at the government primary school. He had left school around 1pm after taking his midday meal. The school is located on the outskirts of Bhogpur village, near sugarcane fields.

He was walking towards the sugarcane field when a male leopard suddenly emerged from the cane stalks, pounced on him, dragged him into the field and killed him. A passerby, Kapil Kumar, who witnessed the attack and tried to rescue the boy was also injured. He is stated to be out of danger.

As news of the boy’s death spread in the village, hundreds of villagers, including the deceased’s family, picked up their guns and went to the cane field where the killer leopard was said to be hiding. They combed the field and found the big cat, shooting him dead on the spot. They dragged the carcass up to the village.

Taking cognizance of the incident, basic shiksha adhikari Mahesh Chandra has set up an inquiry and sought an explanation from school staff of Bhogpur as to why the student was out during the school time. The BSA said all teachers had already been instructed not to allow any student to play on its ground or go near the cane fields alone.

Officials told TOI that the leopard was an adult male, about seven years old.

With the death of the killer leopard, speculation that a leopardess had killed all the victims has ended. Despite forest authorities setting up several cages at Mohandiya village with chicken and mutton as bait, the leopardess eluded them. On Sunday, its picture was captured by one of the several trap cameras set up in the area, indicating that it is still lurking near Mohandiya village.

Pudukottai: Paddy farmers of Avudaiyarkoil block in Pudukottai district are reeling under the sudden impact of false smut fungal infection that has affected their samba crop. False smut is a disease which affects the early flowering of the crop and destroys its ovary thus causing a reduction in the size of the grains.

Farmers from Aranthangi, Avudaiyarkoil, Manalmedu, Alangudi and Arimalam have raised samba paddy crop on thousands of acres thanks to good rain this year. However, with just a few weeks left for harvesting, the sudden manifestation of the disease has left them shell-chocked. A Pilavendhiran, a farmer in Avanam Perungudi in Aranthangi block, has raised paddy on 7 acres and was awaiting harvest. “To my disbelief, I found a major part of my crops suddenly falling prey to the fungus,” he said.

“Even though we got enough rain, the crops were completely destroyed at the eleventh hour. The government should disburse immediate relief to the affected farmers”, he said. State general secretary of Farmers Forum of India G S Ganapathi said that ‘Nel Pazham’ (in Tamil) or Laxmi disease has destroyed the grains of farmers in Aranthangi and Avudaiyarkoil.

“We have decided to take the issue to the district administration demanding compensation to the affected”, he added. Confirming the prevalence of the disease in some parts of Aranthangi, Aavudaiyarkoil, Manamelkudi and Alangudi blocks, joint director of agriculture Pudukottai Subbaiah told TOI, “We are conducting awareness camps at all the villages to educate farmers on how to tackle the situation. We have suggested applying propiconazole. The agriculture department has taken the required measures to curb the fungus”.

As part of the consecration, the authorities of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) commenced work on the temple a few months ago. A scaffolding was erected covering the tower above the main sanctum sanctorum to allow workers perform chemical cleaning.

As the work commenced by ASI is nearing completion, the HR&CE authorities have taken up various works including cleaning the copper kalasam and coating it with gold. After getting approval from ASI, the kalasam – which weighs 25 tonnes and comprises eight parts - was brought down from the tower.

Earlier, scientists from Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research and a technical team from Indian Institute of Technology in Chennai examined the kalasam.

The consecration of the temple, which is a World Heritage Monument, is scheduled to be performed after a gap of more than two decades. The last consecration was held in 1997. The subsequent consecration should have been held in 2009 or 2010.

Officials said that usage of banned plastic products and the quantity of plastic waste accumulated during the festival have significantly come down compared to the previous years. The state government banned the usage of 16 types of single-use plastic products on January 1. Since then the corporation officials have conducted surprise inspections along Chithirai streets and Uthira Streets during festival times to penalise the offenders.

“We have seized 10 kg of banned plastic products, mostly from street vendors and have imposed fine of up to Rs 500 on them. There has been a desirable change among the traders as well as people,” a sanitary inspector with the corporation said. They have collected Rs 5,000 as penalty from shops and street vendors on Monday. Sources said that a majority of the devotees have found carrying cloth bag or jute bag instead of plastic carry bags. The behavioural change has also reflected in the quantity of waste collected by the sanitary workers. “Out of the 5 tonnes of waste we removed from the temple locality, plastic waste is only 1 tonne.

The daughter of freedom fighters Colonel Prem Sehgal and Captain Lakshmi Sehgal of the INA, Ali reached Nahtaur late evening on Sunday, met family members of Suleman and Anas, who were shot dead allegedly by cops during the anti-NRC-CAA protest on December 20 that turned violent.

She said, “All those who were killed during the protests against CCA died from police bullets. That’s why aggrieved families have not been provided post mortem reports.” The former MP alleged, “Some people in the government are using the language of hate about citizens, saying they’ll take revenge. This is deplorable.”

She added, “I met the victim’s families in Nahtaur. They told me there were many people in plainclothes with the cops who lathicharged protesters. Cops say they are ‘police mitras’. Who are these? Who appointed them? Who gave them service-issue batons? Whether they were RSS or Bajrang Dal men needs to be investigated.”

She further stated, “CAA is a poor law. It is based on religion. Government should have mentioned that all people persecuted for their religion will be accommodated.”

Two people were killed and several injured in the violence at Nahtaur on December 20. Three cases were registered against protesters. Police had claimed they had killed Suleman in self-defense, while Anas was killed by a stray bullet fired by protesters.

A SIT was formed to probe the case and a magisterial probe is on. Family members of the deceased had filed complaints against cops, alleging that both Suleman and Anas were shot dead by cops. But their FIRs were not registered. Instead, their complaints were included in cases registered earlier by cops.

Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran (File photo)

LONDON: Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran said the steel conglomerate cannot have a situation where India keeps funding the mounting losses at its struggling Port Talbot steelworks in the UK. He emphasised that the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales, one of the largest in Europe, needed to be ""self-sustaining"" in an interview with the Sunday Times.

The head of the 84-billion pound turnover conglomerate refused to commit to continuing to make UK steel, the report said. Chandrasekaran said, ""I need to get to a situation where at least the plant (Port Talbot) is self-sustaining. Whether it is in the Netherlands or here, we can't have a situation where India keeps funding the losses just to keep it going.""

Tata Steel's pre-tax losses were 371 million pounds last year, up from 222 million pounds in 2017-18. In November, Tata announced plans to cut 3,000 jobs across Europe. Just under half of Tata's 8,385-strong UK workforce are based in Port Talbot, the BBC reported on Sunday.

Paul Evans, the Unite labour union's regional officer for Wales, said, ""This interview just adds more pressure on the Tata workers at Port Talbot. The site is obviously key to the future of the other Tata plants in Wales.

A spokesman for Tata Steel's European operations said, ""What our chairman said has already been communicated to colleagues through our transformation programme."" ""That programme is about building a stronger and more sustainable European steel business by improving profitability so we can pay for investments necessary to secure our long-term future,"" the BBC report quoted the company spokesman.

UP CM Yogi Adityanath

BHOPAL: The BJP is rolling out the big guns to drum up support for Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Madhya Pradesh, where chief minister Kamal Nath has said a clear ‘no’ to the controversial law.

BJP chief Amit Shah will visit Jabalpur on January 12. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and former Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh will arrive next to join BJP’s CAA awareness campaign that is likely to stretch till civic elections in the state.

“Senior leaders of BJP will participate in the mass awareness and contact campaign in Madhya Pradesh. Party president Amit Shah will address a rally in Jabalpur on January 12. We have also invited UP CM Yogi Adityanath and former Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh,” BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal told TOI on Monday.

Yogi is likely to visit between January 10 and 15, say sources. Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar will be in Gwalior on January 7, and Raman Singh is expected to address a rally in Dhar around that time. BJP youth wing nation head Poonam Mahajan will participate in an awareness campaign in Dewas on January 8. Union ministers Thawar Chand Gehlot and Faggan Singh Kulaste, former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and former Rajasthan minister Arun Chaturvedi will join the campaign during the month, say sources.

The BJP campaign will focus on minorities and those opposing the citizenship law, say its leaders. “Congress is spreading lies that the law is against Muslims, but the Act does not mention Indian Muslims. We are contacting all communities to create awareness. Those who are willing to share their opinions have also joined the drive. However, the likes of Congress, who despite knowing the truth are creating confusion and instigating hatred among castes, need not be considered,” said BJP state spokesperson Deepak Vijayvargiya.

Sources in BJP said the party has chalked out a month-long plan, including door-to-door campaign till January 15. “CAA is a very sensitive and crucial issue. Barring a few groups, majority of the public supports the law despite opposition and confusion created by Congress and other opposition parties. The well-planned BJP campaign will not only help people understand the significance of the law but will also create an impact among voters ahead of civic elections in the state,” said a senior BJP state functionary.

Sources said BJP is focusing on communities whose members or their relatives have migrated from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, seeking refuge in India.

224,['7/01/2020'],City’s 2019 conviction rate highest in the past decade,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Vijayawada: The city police commissionerate saw a huge improvement in the conviction rate, which hit 50% in 2019, as compared to the national average of 48.8%. The highest conviction rate in the past 10 years was 42.3% in 2013. In 2018, the city’s conviction rate stood at 40% and before that, it was a mere 34% which was just 1% above the state 33%.

Out of the conviction achieved, seven cases saw the accused getting life imprisonment—one case with a 20-year imprisonment, two cases with 10-year imprisonments. Nevertheless, sources said that a number of issues plague the directorate of prosecution in the city, from delays in trials to a lack of evidence. According to cops, the main reason behind the low conviction rate was predominantly hostile witnesses. Other factors include lack of support from independent witnesses during the trial and both parties having out of court settlements through Lok Adalat.

Compared to 2018, overall, cases that achieved conviction also came down substantially by 43%. This was attributed to the state government’s ‘Spandana’ initiative, which even the city police commissioner acknowledged during the annual press meet, saying that it had helped the police dispose a bulk of cases in one go every week. In fact, the overall petitions disposed under Spandana initiative is 41% more than the cases achieving conviction in the courts.

Officials said that there had been a large number of acquittals in SCs/STs Atrocity cases in the courts and suggested there have been several loopholes in the investigation and in the system as well. While 23 special courts have being constituted for the trials of SCs/STs (APOA) Act cases, there are cases from 1994 which are still pending trial for various reasons.

Cops say they’re hopeful of the conviction rate increasing further on the special POCSO courts put in place to ensure the speedy trial of sexual offences against children. Cops also said that interventions like court monitoring system (CMS—which is a centralised, digital monitor interface that supervises court work to ensure speedy justice) has helped increase the conviction rate, as it helps rectify mistakes while filing chargesheets.

225,['7/01/2020'],"Govt approves 2,600 EV charging stations","This story is from January 7, 2020

Chennai: Giving a major impetus to electric vehicle (EV) mobility the government has approved installation of 2,600 EV charging stations in 62 cities under FAME II. Tamil Nadu will get 256 such charging stations while the union territory of Puducherry will get 10. Maharashtra tops the number of charging points with 317 followed by Andhra Pradesh with 266. Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh will get 228, 205, and 207 EV charging stations respectively.

The union territories of Delhi and Chandigarh are expected to get 72 and 70 charging stations while Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh will get 10 each. The newly minted union territory of Jammu and Kashmir will get 25 charging points.

While Amitabh Kant, CEO, Niti Aayog tweeted that “this would remove range anxiety” as there will be “atleast one charging station” available in a grid of 4 square km, others in the industry called it too broad-brush to make a huge difference.

“A government initiative in EV is welcome, but I am not sure this broad-brush spread of setting up stations will help accelerate adoption. A better way is to set up specific corridors. Just 70 charging stations in Delhi which is the largest automobile market doesn’t make sense,” said Amitabh Saran, CEO, Altigreen Propulsion Labs.

The charging network, he added, focused too much on personal transportation which is not where EV conversion will happen first in India. “The developing market is very economics driven and here the top down approach of scaling down from pricey electric cars won’t happen,” he explained. “Here it will be bottom up with two, three wheelers and small commercial vehicles converting first because the economics favour it.” This bottom end of the pyramid needs to be catered to, he added.

The Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles (SMEV) also feels that while the current initiative will be good for cars, a more low cost infrastructure is needed for two and three wheelers.

“This will greatly help the introduction of electric cars particularly the new launches that already have a good driving range. Another positive step that can greatly help the EVs, particularly the electric two wheelers would be to announce a scheme to install simple low cost charging points in sufficient numbers in the public parking lots and residential complexes,” said Sohinder Gill, director general, SMEV.

Meerut: After a few days of clear weather, the winter chill made a comeback in Meerut. The city also experienced sporadic rainfall on Monday. The temperature here remained considerably low as the difference between maximum and minimum temperature dipped – even as minimum temperature was more than Sunday’s temperature.

“The maximum and minimum temperature recorded in Meerut on Monday were 15.2 degrees Celsius and 10.6 degrees Celsius, respectively. The maximum and minimum humidity levels recorded here on Monday were 82% and 78%, respectively. The city recorded 0.4mm of rainfall on Monday,” said Brij Mohan, meteorological in-charge, Meerut.

While the minimum temperature recorded here on Monday was higher than what was recorded on Sunday, the chill was more on Monday due to the lesser difference between maximum and minimum temperature.

On Sunday, the difference between maximum and minimum temperature was 9.6 degree Celsius as against Monday’s diurnal range of temperature (difference between maximum and minimum temperature) which was recorded at 4.6 degree Celsius.

“The diurnal range of temperature plays a major role in deciding how cold or warm the day will be. Monday was colder than Sunday because the difference between maximum and minimum temperature was lesser than Sunday. Rainfall is predicted in the coming days,” said Mohan.

Trichy: A 5km walkathon has been planned in the city on Sunday, Januray 12, to mark National Siddha Day. The event will be organised by the department of Indian medicine and homeopathy to sensitize people on the health benefits of walking daily.

“While our organs work continuously to keep us alive and healthy, human beings betray themselves by choosing sedentary lifestyle. People have grown the habit of using motor vehicles to even cover a small distance for a work resulting in all types of lifestyle health issues,” said district siddha medical officer S Kamaraj on Monday.

Listing out the lifestyle diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiac problems etc. due to the lack of physical work, Kamaraj insisted on 45 minutes compulsory walking every day or at least thrice a week to prevent falling victim to heart diseases.

“Though several exercises are available for physical fitness, a brisk walk will have numerous positive health benefits on humans. Fat reductions, increasing oxygen supply, controlling diabetes, active mind and body are the few benefits of walking,” he said.

District collector S Sivarasu will flag off the walkathon at Anna Nagar Uzhavar Sandhai grounds. The walkathon will cover 5km stretch via Uzhavarsandhai – district court – Trichy city corporation office – Mutharaiyar statue – Campion school – Cantonment police station – MGR statue before returning to Uzhavarsandhai.

The registration for the participants commenced at the district siddha unit inside Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital in Trichy at free of cost. The participants can register their names from 8am to 5pm.

Thanjavur: A 37-year-old agricultural labourer was on Monday sentenced to four terms of life imprisonment by a mahila court in Thanjavur, for sexually abusing his 10-year-old daughter.

The convict, a native of Mathukur in Thanjavur was residing along with his daughter after his wife passed away in 2015. In 2017, her school teachers noticed some difference in the girl’s activities. When they inquired, they were shocked to find that her father had been sexually abusing her in an inebriated condition ever since her mother’s death. Immediately, they took up the issue with ChildLine authorities, who in turn, rescued the girl and sent her to a government home. Based on a complaint lodged by ChildLine authorities on November 20, 2017, the Pattukottai all-women police arrested the accused.

Meanwhile, medical examination revealed that the girl tested positive for HIV and the accused was the source of the disease. When the hearing came to an end on Monday, the mahila court judge Ezhilarasi sentenced the accused and slapped a fine of Rs 4,500 and ordered that the convict should spend his life in prison till his death. She further recommended the government to provide Rs 5 lakh solatium and medical care. TNN

CHANDIGARH: BJP on Monday named Rajbala Malik as its candidate for the top post in the mayoral election in an announcement backed by all party members barring an evening revolt by a husband-wife couple that was controlled by BJP chief Sanjay Tandon.Malik, considered to be close to MP Kirron Kher, had served as the mayor in 2012 when she was in the Congress. Tandon’s loyalist councillors Ravikant Sharma and Jagtar Singh Jagga were chosen as candidates for the posts of senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. The elections will be held on January 10.At the MC office in Sector 17, drama was witnessed during the filing of nomination papers at the secretary’s chamber, when BJP councillor Chandrawati Shukla’s husband Gopal alias Pappu Shukla announced to file her papers as an independent candidate.

PUNE: District collector Naval Kishor Ram has recommended the suspension of toll collection along the Pune-Satara highway to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) over unsafe road conditions and incomplete work on National Highway 4.The proposal comes after a scrutiny of documents and a verification of the road conditions along the stretch.In mid-December last year, the collector had granted NHAI and the contractor PS Toll Road Private Limited (Reliance Infra) a last chance to complete pending works and improve road conditions by December 31. However, according to Ram and several citizens, none of the promised works have been completed.Speaking to TOI, Ram said, “After scrutiny of the documents, we have found that the concessionaire (Reliance Infra) has violated several clauses of the concession agreement with NHAI. The safety audit has also revealed that the road condition is unsafe. The construction of bridges remains incomplete, service roads are in a poor condition and there have been many more accidents due to lack of repairs. The physical verification by our teams also found the same results. I have proposed to the authority to discontinue toll collection and also initiate speedy needful action. I have done my part as the district collector and hope that they take corrective measures.”In his letter to the authority, Ram says, “NHAI, in its internal report, has stated that despite repeated notices, the contractor has failed to develop and implement solutions to improve road conditions which have led to an increase in road accidents. The NHAI, Pune has also invoked Clause 36.1 and 37.1 of the concession agreement signed on March 10, 2010 and asked Reliance to discontinue toll collection in December last year but the contractor has failed to act upon it. Works to the tune of Rs 160 crore continue to remain incomplete. Schedule D of the agreement also mentions that the contractor must resurface the highway once every five years but Reliance Infra has not taken action in this regard in the last 10 years.”Project director BK Singh said the works at Nasrapur, Varve and Sarola, which were to be completed by December 31, remain incomplete due to no mobilization of vendors. “There is no construction plan either. We have seen nearly 60 to 70 accidents and 40 to 45 fatalities along this stretch in the monsoon months last year,” he added.Sources close to the project said the NHAI has sent repeated notices to the contractor and sought penalty for incomplete work and poor maintenance instead of invoking clause 17.9 of the agreement and hiring a different agency to complete the work.“Not a single overlay or resurfacing has been done since the project commenced in 2010 which has led to extreme deterioration of the road condition. Only temporary carpeting of potholes was conducted when the need arose. There is a dearth of vendors as well which has caused work to be stalled. Instead of taking corrective measures like suspension of toll or others, NHAI has continued to support the contractor at the cost of the lives of citizens,” the source said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73131179,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-787660,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/collector-moots-toll-suspension-on-pune-satara-highway/articleshow/73129608.cms

BHOPAL: Maoists have scattered pamphlets in Balaghat district, announcing their opposition to CAA and NRC. In August last year, Maoists had called a bandh in parts of Chhattisgarh in protest against the abrogation of special status to J&K.

Sources said two kinds of pamphlets were found in Samnapur and Baghatola areas in the Mukki buffer zone of Kanha Tiger Reserve . One was against CAA and NRC, and in the other Maoists protested the displacement of tribals. Police are checking the authenticity of the leaflets.

“Some papers were found. They are being verified,” Balaghat SP Abhishek Tiwari told TOI.

Police have stepped up their combing and search operations in Balaghat following inputs of heightened movement of rebels in the district. Balaghat is on the trjunction of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. The CPI (Maoists) carved out a new zone — Gadchiroli-Rajnandgaon-Balaghat (GRB) — for this region. Rebels use this corridor to hit in one state and run to another, which prompted police to devise a counter-strategy.

“Now, joint teams from Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are working in tandem in search operations. Inter-state issues will not crop up,” Tiwari said, adding that combing ops have been intensified in all affected areas of the district. “Teams are regularly combing the jungles,” he said.

Representative image

CUTTACK: A PIL filed in the Orissa high court has sought intervention for release and rehabilitation of 14 persons suffering under bonded labour system in the guise of ‘Bartan’ syastem in a village of Dhenkanal district .

Acting on it, the court has issued notice to the state government to file a reply to the PIL.

Bartan is the medieval practice of extracting work from barbers and washermen by upper caste families paying a pittance of 75 kg of paddy for the whole year under an oral agreement in rural Odisha.

The state government had abolished the practice after the National Human Rights (NHRC) asked it in January 2011 to stop Bartan system and take action against those who failed to stop the “illegal practice or abetted it”.

The NHRC had described the practice as bonded labour within the definition of ‘bonded debt’ and ‘bonded labour’ as defined under the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976.

Anti-Slavery India (a public charitable trust) represented through its chairman Baghambar Pattanaik filed the petition on April 16, 2018. The case came up on Monday.

“After a preliminary hearing, acting Chief Justice Sanju Panda and Justice S K Sahoo posted the matter for hearing it after two weeks with the response from the authorities concerned,” petitioner’s counsel advocate Khirod Rout said.

“The bench, accordingly, issued notice to principal secretary, panchayati raj department, district collector, Dhenkanal, and sub-collector, Kamakhyanagar, to file their responses by then,” Rout said.

According to the petition, the 14 persons (barbers and washermen) of Gadagaonpur village under Bhuban block of Dhenkanal district are struggling for their release from bonded labour system and right to live with dignity.

When they refused to stick to this profession under Bartan system, they were subjected to social and economic boycott, followed by physical torture, the petition alleged.

The PIL has sought the court’s direction to release and rehabilitate the 14 persons, issue release certificates within 24 hours and provide immediate financial assistance of Rs 20,000 to each of them. The petition also sought direction to the state government to create a bonded labour rehabilitation fund at the district level with a corpus fund of at least Rs 10 lakh at the disposal of the district magistrate.

Nagpur: The first round of auction to remove tendu leaves through e-tendering process has fetched Rs96.13 lakh towards sale of seven units on Monday. The forest department has put 279 units for sale in the state for 2020 season.

The tendu leaves collection starts in April-May and is a big source of employment for forest dwellers and non-dwellers. In the last five years, the forest department has distributed Rs257 crore to 9.7 lakh families in Vidarbha alone towards bonus to tendu collectors.

According TK Choubey, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF) for non-timber forest produce, the department expects to generate 3,08,153 standard bags from 279 units which have been kept for sale. Maharashtra is the first state to start auction of tendu patta in Central India.

“The auction is a low-key affair as tendu-rich states like Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh have not started their auctions yet. Besides, traders still have old stock with them,” said Choubey.

The second and third round will be held from January 21-25, and February 7-1 respectively for groups of units unsold in previous rounds. Offers have been invited only in respect of units included in the non-scheduled areas and doesn’t include units falling in areas under community forest rights (CFRs).

Large tracts of forest are burnt at the behest of contractors in the wrong belief that it fetches better yield. As per the Indian State of Forest Report (ISFR)-2019, Maharashtra was the third state in the country with highest forest fire alerts after Mizoram (2,795) and Madhya Pradesh (2,723). Forest Survey of India (FSI), between November 2018 till June 2019, had issued 2,516 forest alerts to Maharashtra.

“If a fire takes place in tendu unit and deputy conservator concerned finds implementation of preventive measures as suggested in tender conditions were not carried out adequately then licensee will be imposed a penalty up of Rs15,000-Rs 30,000,” Choubey warned.

“This penalty will be for 5% of the tendu unit area burned. Above 10% of the tendu unit area burned, Rs50,000 per unit/group of units will be levied,” he added.

Visakhapatnam: With the wind blowing strongly in favour of Vizag as the state’s executive capital, top officials of various departments in Vijayawada have already swung into action and are busy searching for accommodation through their subordinates in the city.

Although the government is yet to issue an official statement or order on the executive capital issue, but following the statement of YSRC’s Rajya Sabha MP Vijayasai Reddy about setting up of the capital in Bheemili, most of the officers are believed to be searching for houses on the city’s outskirts.

A senior bureaucrat told TOI that officers of various departments have already started enquiry about rental accommodation in areas like Madhurawada, Yendada, Sagar Nagar, Rushikonda, and Mithilapuri Vuda Colony.

“When we were searching for a triple bedroom accommodation in Rushikonda and Yendada area, we came to know that many other government officials have already enquired about the accommodations,” a revenue official said.

A real estate developer said they too have come to know that many government officers have been enquiring about rented accommodation. “Due to scarcity of sand and the stringent Rera regulations, construction activity had come down in the last two years. On an average, 500 to 1,000 flats used to be sold every month in Vizag. But the number has come down to below hundred in recent months. Only big builders have the wherewithal to complete their ventures,” he said.

He said hundreds of flats are lying vacant which could house many top officers of the secretariat. “There are many big complexes near IT Park road at Mithilapuri Vuda colony where around 300 to 400 flats are almost ready and lying vacant as there are no buyers. In most complexes, hardly 25 per cent of flats are occupied, the rest are vacant and can serve those looking for rental accommodation,” he added.

LUCKNOW: A 30-year-old accused in a triple murder case allegedly shot himself using a countrymade pistol in the presence of police in Mainpuri district court on Monday. Five constables were suspended for the lapse.

The incident took place barely a fortnight after a shoot-out within a courtroom in Bijnor in which an alleged history-sheeter was shot dead while he was appearing in a murder case by the son of a murdered BSP leader. The incident has set the alarm bells ringing over security arrangements in district courts in UP.

While the state government had earlier directed the state police to draft a security plan for district courts, the Allahabad High Court had directed the government to submit a detailed report of the security arrangements in place.

Police said that the accused Manish, in connivance with Kallu and Jitendra, had on October 9, 2012 shot dead his father Sukhram, stepmother Sushma Devi and brother Abhishek over a property dispute under Karhal police station area of the district.

Manish along with Kallu and Jitendra were produced in the court of Additional District Judge-IV, Tarun Kumar Singh for hearing in the 2012 triple murder case on Monday.

Police circle officer (Mainpuri city) Abhay Narayan Rai told TOI that around 3pm, before Manish was asked to personally explain the circumstances on the day of the crime by appearing in the court, he took out a countrymade weapon and shot at his right foot.

“Manish was sent to the district hospital and is out of danger. His statement is yet to be recorded by the police,” Rai added.

CHANDIGARH: A special CBI court on Monday rejected the third closure report submitted in the multi-crore theme-cum-amusement park project scam and summoned former UT adviser Lalit Sharma, former home secretary Krishan Mohan and former tourism director Vivek Atray and Unitech Limited director Ajay Chandra on January 20, implying that the trial would start.

Sharma, Mohan and Atray and Chandra had been booked for corruption, abuse of power and criminal conspiracy under sections 120 B, 420 and 201 of the IPC and sections 13(1)d and section 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act.

The CBI had registered the FIR on October 4, 2010, stating that former top UT officials in connivance with Unitech Limited indulged in criminal conspiracy and awarded 73.65 acres of land in Sarangpur to the company for a Rs 5.5-crore fixed annual licence fee and on 1.1%% annual revenue sharing basis. It was alleged the administration ignored financial rules while inviting tenders and shortlisting companies. These officers had allegedly “ignored” the highest bidder, DLF, and allotted the project to Unitech. The case had been referred to the CBI by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).

The third closure report was submitted in November 2018, stating no evidence was found against the accused. The CBI had earlier moved two closure reports in the case but the court rejected them, stressing the need for further investigation.

The court order stated, “The CBI had filed closure report in the case thrice. Complainant Vivek Aditya was not satisfied with the investigation and the closure reports. He has submitted photocopies of documents related to the arbitration proceedings initiated by Unitech Limited against the administration and claimed Rs 95 crore with respect to the project in question. The closure report is rejected and all the accused ordered to be summoned for January 20.”

The closure report stated, “...sufficient evidence has not emerged against the accused during the course of investigation. Further, no evidence has also emerged that the accused officials/accused company were in knowledge about the financial bid of DLF, in absence of which it could not be conclusively established that the accused officials acted in conspiracy with each other, to deliberately disqualify DLF and for making Unitech Limited the highest bidder. However, as the project has winded up…, no criminality can be attributed to the accused. The project has not been implemented ever since and thus no wrongful loss/gain was seen to have finally accrued to anyone.”

THEME PARK PROJECT SCAM

The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) probed financial irregularities in the multi-crore theme-cum-amusement park project following a complaint from Vivek Aditya, an RTI activist, in 2009

CUTTACK: A PIL filed in the Orissa high court has sought intervention for release and rehabilitation of 14 persons suffering under bonded labour system in the guise of ‘Bartan’ syastem in a village of Dhenkanal district .

Acting on it, the court has issued notice to the state government to file a reply to the PIL.

Bartan is the medieval practice of extracting work from barbers and washermen by upper caste families paying a pittance of 75 kg of paddy for the whole year under an oral agreement in rural Odisha.

The state government had abolished the practice after the National Human Rights (NHRC) asked it in January 2011 to stop Bartan system and take action against those who failed to stop the “illegal practice or abetted it”.

The NHRC had described the practice as bonded labour within the definition of ‘bonded debt’ and ‘bonded labour’ as defined under the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976.

Anti-Slavery India (a public charitable trust) represented through its chairman Baghambar Pattanaik filed the petition on April 16, 2018. The case came up on Monday.

“After a preliminary hearing, acting Chief Justice Sanju Panda and Justice S K Sahoo posted the matter for hearing it after two weeks with the response from the authorities concerned,” petitioner’s counsel advocate Khirod Rout said.

“The bench, accordingly, issued notice to principal secretary, panchayati raj department, district collector, Dhenkanal, and sub-collector, Kamakhyanagar, to file their responses by then,” Rout said.

According to the petition, the 14 persons (barbers and washermen) of Gadagaonpur village under Bhuban block of Dhenkanal district are struggling for their release from bonded labour system and right to live with dignity.

When they refused to stick to this profession under Bartan system, they were subjected to social and economic boycott, followed by physical torture, the petition alleged.

The PIL has sought the court’s direction to release and rehabilitate the 14 persons, issue release certificates within 24 hours and provide immediate financial assistance of Rs 20,000 to each of them. The petition also sought direction to the state government to create a bonded labour rehabilitation fund at the district level with a corpus fund of at least Rs 10 lakh at the disposal of the district magistrate.

HARIDWAR: The forest department has taken cognisance of the damage happening to the forest area that comes under Char Dham All-Weather Road widening project at Chinyalisaur in Uttarkashi. The department plans to send a notice to the construction company involved in the project.

Forest officials have been directed to analyse the damage caused to the local ecosystem due to the negligence of company workers. “We have learnt through our frontline team and local villagers that some areas under our jurisdiction have faced devastation. Our staff is estimating the loss and very soon we will be sending a penalty notice to the respective company,” Sandeep Kumar, division forest officer, Uttarkashi, told TOI. When asked about the amount of penalty which could be charged from the company, the official said, “The penalty may go higher than Rs 1 lakh. The amount will not just be calculated upon the loss of trees but also upon the loss of other natural resources (if any) in nearby areas.” Earlier on Sunday, shopkeepers and local residents of Bramkhal town had staged a protest against the construction company.

The locals alleged that the construction company is working carelessly and as a consequence, accidents have become more frequent.

They pointed out that there was rampant muck dumping and debris being left unattended on the road.

Meanwhile, the company officials have assured that the debris will be taken care of and the damaged drains and roads will soon be repaired. Notably, forest divisions of Kedarnath and Almora have earlier levied penalty on the construction companies for violating NGT norms by causing damage to local eco-system.

The all-weather road project is aimed at connecting Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, Yamunotri, and part of the route leading to Kailash Mansarovar yatra.

CHENNAI: An all-women gang using a senior citizen as bait kidnapped a 20-year-old woman in an autorickshaw and robbed 15 sovereigns of gold jewellery at knifepoint in Kodungaiyur on Sunday night.

The victim Basheera Banu, 20, of Muthamizh Nagar in Kodungaiyur, was walking towards a restaurant to buy dinner when an old woman sought alms from her, police said. Police said she had just returned from a family function and was wearing gold jewellery.

“After Basheera gave her Rs 10, the elderly woman asked Basheera to help her cross the Tondiarpet High Road. Once they crossed the road, the elderly woman dragged Basheera to an autorickshaw, where three other women were present,” a police officer said, quoting the incident from Basheera’s complaint.

They bundled Basheera into the vehicle and sped away. After robbing her jewellery weighing more than 15 sovereigns at knifepoint, they dropped her at a random spot and fled, the officer said. Basheera borrowed a cellphone from a passerby and called her husband Mohammed Yusuf.

Based on a complaint, the Kodungaiyur police registered a case and are skimming through CCTV camera footage to identify the suspects. In her complaint, Basheera stated that the autodriver was a woman. “We suspect the elderly woman to be part of the gang too, since they took her in the same autorickshaw after abandoning the victim,” said an investigating officer.

Visakhapatnam: Experts believe that the soil types in Visakhapatnam are far more suitable for construction than Amaravati , where the soil type is black-cotton.

Pointing out that the construction costs would come down, at least by 30% to 50% , if the executive capital were to be built in Visakhapatnam, experts said the northern and eastern sections of the city are suitable for construction of modern high rises.

“The major soil types in Visakhapatnam are sandy and rocky; construction activity in these two soil types is fairly simple, with no need for rafter-pylon combination. In case of Amaravati the soil type is predominantly black-cotton, which is lose and does not bind. Therefore there is a need to erect deep pylons coupled with rafters,” said, professor CNV Satyanarayana Reddy, an expert in soil-mechanics at the civil engineering department, Andhra University.

Ch Srinivas, vice-president of Credai, Visakhapatnam chapter, also agreed that construction cost would come down drastically. “If you look at the locations where land is being scouted, it is all rocky and sandy, therefore as per my estimate construction costs would be reduce by at least 30%.”

Former MLA, Vizag North, P Vishnu Kumar Raju concurred with their view and said, “The actual construction cost, including the air-conditioning and interiors, would not exceed Rs 5,000 per square foot in Visakhapatnam. In Amaravati the construction cost would be at least 50% to 100% more.”

VIJAYAWADA: For the third consecutive day, a farmer from the capital region died of cardiac arrest in Velagapudi village, in Guntur district , on Monday.

The deceased was identified as Gopal Rao (60). According to sources, Rao suffered the attack hours after he received the news that his grandson was being arrested for allegedly attacking a vernacular TV channel reporter’s car and attempting to murder her. Police sources said that they detained Rao’s grandson as they had video evidence against him and 14 others who allegedly vandalised the female scribe’s car trying to drag her out. Rao was also told that his grandson was found to be absconding in the case, despite the police giving notice seeking his cooperation.

Family sources said that the moment Rao received the news of his grandson’s arrest in an attempt murder case, he had collapsed and broke down. Moments later, Rao suffered a massive cardiac arrest leading to his death.

On Saturday and Sunday, two other farmers belonging to Dondapadu and Mandadam village in the capital region—who gave their lands for Amaravati—too died of cardiac arrest, taking the overall tally to three.

The case was the same in other schools, teachers said. They said they were expecting low attendance since there had been forecast of cold weather this week and rain. “None of the schools I checked had more than 30% attendance,” said a teacher. Teachers are expecting low attendance till Wednesday. “If the weather remains cold and cloudy, students will not show up,” another teacher shared.

Parents, on the other hand, said the education department should have extended the vacation for another week. “It is extremely cold. The department can at least keep schools closed for primary schoolchildren,” said Bhavika Rana, a resident of Sector 32.

Surinder Singh another parent said, “there has been a forecast for this week of cold weather conditions due to rainfall, since last week. I don’t understand why department did not extend the vacations in such conditions. They could at least change the timings.”

Akash, a Class VIII student from one of the government schools, said, “Only 10 students had come in my class. It was very cold inside. We all have decided to not come if the weather remains cold. We only revised and did not study anything new.”

Delighted with the outcome of the project, local farmers have asked government agencies to provide seeds and technical assistance so that the crop can be cultivated in larger area.

“We have successfully cultivated kesar crop in Sukki village of Upla Taknor region of Uttarkashi district. In the initial trial, we cultivated the crop in nearly a 2,000 square feet land and got nearly 120 gram of high quality Kesar, which is worth Rs 20,000,” Pankaj Nautiyal, horticulture expert and in charge of Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Chinyalisaur, told TOI.

He said that Sukki, Jaspur, Purali, and other villages of Uttarkashi have conducive conditions for the cultivation of kesar as they are situated at an altitude of 1,800-2,200 metre above sea level and also receive optimum sunlight.

“Farmers of other high-altitude areas can also grow this crop. However, lack of proper climatic conditions may impact quantity and quality of crops. We witnessed this during our trial in Jhala village,” added Nautiyal.

Notably, Kesar is hailed as red gold due to its medicinal value and aroma.

Pratap Singh, a farmer from Sukki village who was involved with the team of experts for saffron cultivation, said, “Saffron crop takes less time. It is cultivated from August last week to September first week and becomes ready to be harvested by November end. Besides, the crop needs less space and farmers can cultivate it in the vacant spaces of their apple orchids. Therefore, farmers should choose this crop along with their regular apple cultivation to multiply their income.”

Another local farmer Mohan Singh Rana said, “Cultivation of saffron along with apple will be economically beneficial for farmers. Government agencies like horticulture department should spread awareness and provide support to farmers as it would be difficult and costlier for most of us to get good quality seeds and technical assistance from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.”

Representative image

VIJAYAWADA: The AP State Road Transport Corporation, which became a government entity from January 1, plans to add 1,000 new buses to its fleet in financial year 2020-21, including 250 in the next three months, transport department principal secretary MT Krishna Babu said on Monday. He added that the fleet expansion would be done through acquisition and hiring route as the corporation is facing a shortage of drivers.

Asked about the current workforce strength of the RTC , Krishna Babu said the corporation has over 51,000 workers with a fleet of 12,500 buses. However, he denied that the corporation was overstaffed.

“RTC’s per bus staff strength is about 4.8 workers per bus, which is among the lowest among all government-owned bus companies in the country. The staff strength per bus was six in 2014, when bifurcation happened,” he told TOI.

Though RTC is grappling with a shortage of around 800 drivers, there are no plans as of now to hire new staff to replace the retiring employees, he said. “Each bus has a driver, conductor and mechanic to handle repairs. A shortage of 800 drivers means RTC will have to take a call on whether to outsource the requirement, or to hire new drivers. That’s a call the corporation has to take,” he added.

On whether the state government had budgeted for the wage bill of RTC for the current financial year, Krishna Babu said the monthly wage bill would be around Rs 300 crore. “The government will need to make arrangements for the wage bill for February and March this year. From next year, the annual wage bill will be Rs 3,600 crore,” he informed.

The decision to merge RTC into the government was taken by the state cabinet in September last year, based on the recommendations of an expert committee led by C Anjaneya Reddy, a former IPS officer who had served as managing director of APSRTC.

A merger with the government had been a long-standing demand of RTC employees to give them better job security. The AP budget was presented by finance minister Buggana Rajendranath in July last year, two months before the cabinet decision to merge the corporation with the government.

Students hold a protest against the JNU attack at the Student Centre in Pannjab University, Chandigarh

CHANDIGARH: Haryana speaker Gian Chand Gupta faced the anger of a handful of Panjab University (PU) students over the JNU attack while he was addressing a seminar on ‘Women’s Participation in Decision Making’ at the evening department auditorium in PU on Monday.

Around 20 to 25 representatives of various student parties sitting in the more than 100-seater auditorium holding banners about the JNU attack started raising slogans like “Modi sarkar murdabad”, “Shame on Modi sarkar” and when Gupta started listing steps the central government had taken for empowering women and increasing the quantum of punishment for rapists. No BJP leader should talk about women empowerment as they themselves propagate attacks on women on campus, students alleged, demanding Gupta not be allowed to speak. They alleged that on one side the speaker claims the government is working on women empowerment while on the other its student body ABVP attacks JNU student organization president and professors. Their outburst prompted PU faculty to step in. Professor Emanual Nahar, dean student welfare, Professor Neena Capalash (DSW-women) and Professor Ashwani Kaul, chief of university security, forcefully removed the students out of the auditorium even as they continued the sloganeering.

Gupta described the students’ protest “a predetermined act”. He, however, said, “Everybody has the right to speak, but in a decent way.” Gupta also spoke about the violence in JNU. “There are people who have an agenda to divide the nation and we should make them understand that we all are united. Political parties should not indulge in campus issues,” Gupta said. He alleged those indulging in violence in universities get directions from their heads sitting abroad. Gupta said those opposing this seminar are against women empowerment and do not want any development or change to happen in the country. Earlier, one of the protesting students, Kanupriya, slammed the Centre for the violence on the JNU campus. “The Vidhan Sabha speaker (during seminar) was saying that they want to promote beti padhao. Is this way they will teach girls,” she asked.

DEHRADUN: A special session of the Uttarakhand assembly will be convened on January 7 to ratify the Constitution (126th) amendment bill, which proposes to extend quota to SC/ST in Lok Sabha and state assemblies by another 10 years. On Monday, a meeting of business advisory committee was held at the assembly complex to discuss the proposed agenda of the day, along the matters, which will be tabled in the assembly.

Speaker Premchandra Agarwal said that the meeting was successfully held for the smooth conduct of the assembly session.

Incidentally, the reservation for members of SC and ST community, given to them for past 70 years in Lok Sabha and state assemblies, is due to end on January 25, 2020.

The Lok Sabha passed the constitutional amendment bill to this effect in early December last year, which now has to be ratified by at least 50% of the assemblies before it comes into force.

According to sources, the ruling party is also likely to bring the issue of reservation for Anglo-Indian in the state assembly.

CHENNAI: Most Tamils living in Australia are among those most affected by the bushfire as they live in Sydney and Melbourne. The continent is home to about one lakh Tamil migrants, of whom 50% are from Tamil Nadu. The rest are from Sri Lanka.

G Kiruthiga from Chennai, who is residing in western Sydney, about 100km from the epicentre of bushfire, said carbon emissions were bad.

“I can still feel the smoke and have breathing difficulties. We would airdry clothes in the balcony and find black powdery specks on them the next day,” she said. The Indian community is assisting with relief work, she added.

According to media reports, the deadly southern-summer fires have destroyed more than eight million hectares of bushland in Australia, killing at least 24 people. The disaster has also taken a heavy toll on wildlife, charring thousands of birds and animals to death.

Anagan Babu, president of Tamil Arts and Culture Association in Australia, said Tamils largely reside in Sydney and Melbourne.

“This is the largest drought that the residents of Sydney have faced in the past two decades. Water is being rationed and restricted for domestic use,” he told TOI from Sydney on Monday. Soaring temperatures breached new record due to the inferno last week, he added.

The devastating bushfire has also taken a heavy toll on tourism sector, with a section of city residents who had plans to tour Australia putting it off. Manish Kriplani of Outbound Tour Operators Association of India, said approximately 50,000 tourists from South India fly to Australia every year.

“Those planning to travel to Australia in the next two to three weeks have cancelled their trips following the bushfire. However, we are bullish that the development will not hit the upcoming season starting from May,” he added.

Tourism is an important sector for Australia. “In fact, Australian authorities went ahead with the annual fireworks event on the eve of New Year despite protests as the event in Sydney draws international tourists, generating 130 million Australian dollars revenue,” Anagan Babu said.

Tourism industry sources said people are looking for alternate destinations. Chairman of tourism sub committee of Travel Agents Association of India, Sriharan Balan, said European destinations such as Georgia and Hungary are being suggested as alternate destinations to those who have already explored northern Europe and the US.

He said the state government has reportedly decided to set up high court benches in Amaravati and Visakhapatnam. Since the chief minister has proposed three capitals, Rayalaseema deserves a mini secretariat and an assembly session.

Venkatesh said, while welcoming the three-capital proposal, “Jagan should not focus only on development of north Andhra, he should develop all three regions equally otherwise the state would divide on regional basis,” he said.

On difference of opinion in BJP leaders over the capital city, the MP said there is no difference of opinion on the issue. “We have freedom of speech. Every leader in the party wishes his region should become the capital. Whatever I am saying is my personal opinion.

NAGPUR: The museum of Dalit icon Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar at Chicholi will be ready by the end of the month, say officials of Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT). The statue of Dr Ambedkar in the museum will, however, take some more time. “Finishing touches are being given and the buildings are being cleaned,” said an official.

NIT is facing a finance problem in the project, which, to some extent, is the reason for the delay. “The cost of the project is Rs41 crore and it is being funded by the social justice department. Till date we have not received a single penny. The contractors have not been paid and they regularly complain to us about non-payment of bills,” said an official.

The official further said that with Dalit MLA Nitin Raut becoming a minister, he expected the government to sanction the required amount soon.

The museum is located at Chicholi, which is 20 kilometre from the city centre on Katol Road. It is spread over an area of 11.5 acre. It also has a vipassana centre, hostel for students, anapan sati centre, monks’ quarters, a grand entrance gate, cafeteria and wash rooms.

The museum will house 988 articles of personal use of Dr Ambedkar. They were collected by his close aide Wamanrao Godbole, who built a small museum on his own. National Research Laboratory for Conservation of Cultural Property (NRLCCP), Lucknow, restored these articles and now their life has been extended by 100 years.

Godbole had conceived the museum way back in 1956, when the father of the Indian Constitution passed away. He started work on it after retiring from the railways in 1985. He developed the museum bit by bit with his own money and taking donations from friends and acquaintances. He continued the process till his death in 2006.

After Godbole’s death, the Indian Buddhist Council (IBC) urged the state government to build a grand museum to showcase these articles. The Congress-NCP government agreed in principle but the then chief minister Prithviraj Chavan refused to change the reservation of Chicholi land, which was reserved for a stone quarry. His successor Devendra Fadnavis of BJP did the job and the project took off.

Visakhapatnam: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy conducted a review meeting with officials of various civic bodies of the state, including the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), on Monday in Vijayawada.

The CM asked officials to ensure that Visakhapatnam gets continuous water supply by laying a direct underground pipeline from the Polavaram project and asked them to prepare proposals for the same. He also reviewed the Vizag metro rail project and asked officials to explore the option of tram-model public transport system on the beach road — from RK beach in the city to Bheemili — as part of the metro rail project. “A consultant will be appointed to prepare a DPR for the metro rail project. We are getting ready to distribute 1.5 lakh housing plots to the public in Visakhapatnam,” the CM said.

Jagan also touched upon using desalinated water for industrial purposes. “Supplying tertiary treated water to the industries can be another option. Freshwater should only be used for drinking purpose. If needed, a separate Act should be made on the same,” he said.

He asked officials to appoint special officers for Tadepalli, Mangalagiri and Pulivendula municipalities to monitor the developmental activities. The officials concerned were told to come up with developmental proposals for these three towns, to which the officials said they are in the process of preparing DPRs for the same. They further added that they have identified 10,794 eligible beneficiaries for distribution of housing plots in Tadepalli and Mangalagiri.

The chief minister directed officials to speed up the retaining wall works on Krishna river to prevent inundation of the areas along its bank. He also agreed to upgrade Kamalapuram and Kuppam as municipalities. “The officials should gear up for the upcoming municipal elections,” he said.

Hyderabad: Four members of a burglary gang were arrested by LB Nagar central crime station (CCS) police with the help of Meerpet police on Monday. The cops also recovered 47.5 tolas of gold, 2 kg silver, an air pistol along with pellets, two pepper sprays, three bikes, and three TV sets worth Rs 22 lakh from their possession.

The arrested were identified as the mastermind V Manikandan (37) from Madanapet, P Yadaiah (38) from Choutuppal, Sk Syed (33) from Kompally and M Upendra Chary (38) from Bhongir. Another accused, A Laxminarayana of Dhoolpet, was arrested by Meerpet police in December last year.

Meerpet police had stopped a bike at Maruti Nagar during vehicle check on the night of December 12. It was being driven by Manikandan with Laxminarayana as pillion rider. Manikandan initially tried to introduce himself as a taskforce cop and even showed an air pistol, but the cops noticed a pouch with tools usually used by burglars. The accused then used pepper spray on them and fled from the spot. However, the cops managed to nab Laxminarayana.

During interrogation, Laxminarayana confessed he was part of a burglary gang and said that they have committed 27 burglaries in Uppal, Thurkapally, Hayathnagar, Abdullapurmet, Meerpet, Valigonda, Vanasthalipuram, Saroornagar, LB Nagar and Balapur in a span of three years. Based on details provided by him, the cops arrested the others at Nandi Hills Colony.

“The accused had mortgaged some stolen items at Choutuppal and kept some at Manikandan’s house,” Rachakonda commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat said.

Amit Shah

BHOPAL: Amidst protests on Citizenship (amendment) Act and non-BJP states' denial to implement the newly-enacted law, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the home minister was talking to the states on the issue.

Earlier two BJP MPs- Khajuraho's VD Sharma and Hoshangabad 's Uday Pratap Singh- had threatened “action” against the governments that have refused to implement the new law.

On December 25, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh Kamal Nath had led a protest march against the CAA during which he had refused to implement it in the state.

Similar statements have also come from other non-BJP ruled states like West Bengal, Chattisgarh and Rajasthan among others.

On Saturday night, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar reached Morena, his constituency, to create awareness among the people for the new law.

Later talking to a group of reporters, Tomar said that “this is an amendment in the constitution and it was passed by two-third majority. It was passed in Lok Sabha as well as in Rajya Sabha.”

When asked to react on the statement of BJP MP VD Sharma in Morena that the Centre would initiate action against the governments which would not implement it, Tomar said, “the Union Home minister is authorised to talk to the states which are opposing it and he is talking to them.”

He claimed, “Opposition parties are misleading the people. They (parties) can consult legal experts also to know that the act is already implemented in their states.”

Soon after VD Sharma’s veiled threat, BJP MP from Hoshangabad Uday Pratap Singh issued a direct threat.

Two days ago, Singh in Hoshangabad said article 370 may be invoked for imposition of the President’s rule in the states that have refused to implement the law.

The torched truck

NAGPUR: Kalamna police on Monday registered a case against 15 unidentified persons who had allegedly set a stationary truck on fire after two persons were killed in an accident on Chikhli flyover on Sunday late night.

The accused have been booked for rioting, unlawful assembly and arson. Police have identified the victims killed in the accident. They are Devlal Shahu, a resident of Vinoba Bhave Nagar, and his friend Santosh Mahale. Anand Katekar was injured in the accident.

According to police, the three were on a bike travelling from vegetable market when they initially went past the trailer. They slowed down their bike as another truck was parked on the bridge and the trailer coming from behind hit them. Devlal and Mahale were crushed under the wheels of the trailer while Katekar escaped with injuries. Katekar was rushed to the hospital by passers-by.

Kalamna police reached the spot. “It was hard for us to take out the bodies as we could not move the trailer or the bodies would have been crushed even more. We somehow managed to drag the body out and sent them to Mayo Hospital. By that time a mob had started to gather,” said night officer API Rahul Dongre who was present at the scene.

While the police were busy sending bodies to hospital, some miscreants set the truck parked on the flyover on fire causing damage worth Rs7 lakh. It also resulted in a traffic jam. Police then called NMC’s fire tender. “We tried to control the fire but couldn’t do anything. Even the fire tender reached after 50 minutes,” added Dongre.

It took cops several hours to normalize the traffic. Kalamna police have seized the trailer and registered a case of rash driving and death due to negligence against the trailer driver who is on the run.

Lt Gen PN Hoon

CHANDIGARH: Lt Gen P N Hoon, one of the senior most military veterans of the Tricity and former commander of the Army’s Western Command, breathed his last on Monday. He was 90.

Lt Gen Hoon was born at Abbottabad in Pakistan and commissioned into the Army in 1947.

His cremation would take place on Tuesday.

Lt Gen Hoon had served during the Chinese aggression in 1962, 1965 Indo-Pak war and carried out one of the most difficult attacks on the Siachen glacier in 1984, re-capturing over 7,500 square kilometres of strategic Indian territory occupied by Pakistan which was being gradually ceded to China. He had commanded mountain and infantry brigades, infantry division and the 15 Corps in Kashmir. He also served as director general military operations and retired in 1987 as Army Commander, Western Command, Chandimandir.

Post-retirement, he was engaged in several social activities and very vocal on various national security issues. He had once approached the Supreme Court seeking voting rights for serving soldiers at their places of posting. His main plea was that the soldiers should be allowed to go and cast their votes directly at the polling booths, which can be set up in the cantonment areas and there should not be any condition of tenure of deployment in that area.

In October 2015, he had launched his book, “The Untold Truth”, in which he claimed that there was a plot to topple Rajiv Gandhi government in 1987 and three crack Para-Commando battalions, including one from the Western Command, were told to move for action in Delhi. In his book he had also hinted that the coup was apparently at behest of the then President, Giani Zail Singh, as his relations with Rajiv Gandhi were not cordial.

Tourists enjoying the snowfall in Mussoorie

DEHRADUN: High-altitude places in Uttarakhand, including the prominent hill stations, are likely to get heavy to very heavy snowfall during the next 48 hours and severe cold conditions will prevail in both hills and plains of the state.

According to the regional meteorological centre, a strong western disturbance is going to affect the western Himalayan region from January 6 to January 8. As a result, places located at 2000-2500m and above in Uttarakhand are likely to receive heavy snowfall during the period.

Bikram Singh, director of regional meteorological centre, told TOI that hill stations such as Mussoorie , Chakrata and Nainital might end up receiving one to two feet of snowfall cumulatively. While other places located at much higher altitude such as Auli and Munsyari are expected to witness snowfall up to five to six feet.

“Although the snow and rain activity will being from January 6 night onwards, it will be more intense on January 8,” Met officials said.

Besides, hail is likely to occur at isolated places in the plains and foothill areas of Dehradun , Haridwar, Udham Singh Nagar, Pauri and Nainital districts during the same period,” Singh said.

Moreover, Met office has issued a yellow-coloured warning of cold day to sever cold day conditions in both hills and plains of Uttarakhand during the next 48 hours starting from Tuesday morning.

The heavy snowfall in the hills might also cause road blockages and the met office has issued an advisory to the state government to take necessary steps in advance so that residents and tourists face minimum inconvenience.

Meanwhile, days after Mussoorie received the year’s first snowfall, accumulated snow and frost continued to pose a threat to traffic movement in several places in the hill town.

On Monday, several vehicles were stuck up owing to slippery road conditions caused due to snow and frost between Picture Palace and Landour. This led to traffic congestion on the road. Two-wheeler riders were also finding it difficult to negotiate the slippery road and several cases of skidding of two wheelers was reported.

However, with the help of local residents and police, the situation was brought under control and the stuck vehicles were removed. Speaking to TOI, station officer Vidhya Bhushan Negi said that by late afternoon normal traffic was resumed between Picture Palace and Landour.

Several stretches across the town, including Zero-point towards Kempty falls, Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) to Municipal Gardens, Waverly Convent School to Clouds end, Harnam Singh Road continued to be slippery with very little movement of traffic.

Meanwhile, tourists going towards Dhanaulti were stopped at Bata Ghat owing to the slippery condition of roads. “Tourists, particularly two-wheelers, going for sightseeing towards Dhanolit were stopped near Bata Ghat owing to security reasons as the roads are still very slippery. However, those who had valid hotel bookings at Dhanolti were allowed to pass but were asked to drive with caution,” Negi told.

Chennai: Singapore Tourism is looking at attracting more visitors by promoting the island as a destination for weddings, cruises and overseas excursions this year.

G B Srithar, regional director, India, Middle East and South Asia of Singapore Tourism Board said, “We will focus on these elements to encourage more visitors. We used to promote school excursions years ago.” Destination weddings are becoming a thing among Indians, he said, adding, “We want people from Tamil Nadu to hold their weddings in Singapore.”

In a bid to promote educational institutions to take up excursions, Singapore tourism will encourage travel agents to offer incentives, he added. Singapore Tourism Board conducted a roadshow in the city where officials interacted with around 100 travel and tour operators.

“South India is an important region for us with direct flights available from nine cities, including Chennai, Trichy and Coimbatore,” he said.

Cruise tours are a great hit among Indians as they’ve hopped aboard cruises to the island most. “This makes it important for us. Indian cruise travellers are the youngest, with an average age of less that 30 years against the global average of 40. A good number of people who take cruise tours also stay in Singapore.”

Similarly, Indians top the number of tourists who visit Sentosa island, he added. India is number one source market for cruise tours and 1.6 lakh people have gone on cruises to Singapore in 2018.

Till October 2019, 1.19 million tourists from India visited Singapore.

NAGPUR: Rural areas of the district are all set for zilla parishad (ZP) and panchayat samiti (PS) elections on Tuesday. Counting will take place on Wednesday at 13 tehsil headquarters.

In view of the prevailing fluid political situation, the prestige of cabinet ministers Anil Deshmukh and Sunil Kedar and BJP leaders Nitin Gadkari and Devendra Fadnavis is at stake.

Nagpur ZP has 58 circles or seats while there are 116 PS seats. There are 1,828 polling booths for the election. Out of these, 182 centres have been declared as model ones. There are about 14.19 lakh voters eligible to cast vote during the polling to be held between 7.30 am and 5.30pm.

Out of the 58 ZP circles, 10 are reserved for SC, seven for ST and 16 for OBCs, leaving 25 seats for general category. In all these categories, 50% seats are reserved for women. Thus, there are 29 seats for the fairer sex. There are 270 candidates in the fray for these seats, while 497 candidates are contesting the PS polls.

Thirteen tehsildars have been appointed as assistant returning officers (AROs) for their respective areas. A total 225 zones have been created for 58 circles. In all, 2,012 control units and 4,024 ballot units will be used in the election, while 10% machines have been kept ready for replacing faulty ones, if any. There will be no VVPATs in these elections.

Congress and NCP have a pre-poll alliance for these elections. Congress is contesting 42 ZP seats while NCP is fighting on 16. Congress candidates are in the fray in 97 PS seats, while the corresponding figure for NCP is 19. Shiv Sena and BJP are contesting separately. Sena has not fielded its candidates in a couple of seats apparently to help Congress-NCP candidates. Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) has fielded candidates at 20 ZP seats while 13 Prahar candidates are also in the fray.

Deshmukh, Kedar, Fadnavis, Gadkari, Sena-supporter MLA Ashish Jaiswal and others have campaigned extensively for these elections. Before the earlier body was dissolved, BJP had 21 members, Sena eight, Congress 19, NCP seven and smaller parties three. BJP and Sena had ruled the bodies with the help of smaller parties. This time though, an alliance between Congress, NCP and Sena is expected and BJP has little chance of retaining power.

People from the capital region protest against the proposal of three capital cities

AMARAVATI: Ignoring police restrictions, capital city farmers held maha padayatra from Thullur to Mandadam village on Monday. Hundreds of farmers took part in the rally demanding that the state government not shift the capital city from Amaravati.

A little while before the launch of the padayatra, additional SP Chakravarthi advised the farmers to keep away from angry protests as no permission had been granted. “Although, every citizen has the right to protest , it should not be at the cost of others convenience,” the additional SP said. He warned of serious action if locals violated restrictions. He said that the police had not granted any permission to the farmers as section 144 of Cr PC and Section 30 of Police Act were in force in the capital city area.

Paying no heed to the police restrictions, farmers gathered in huge numbers in Thullur village by 10am. Hundreds of women also joined the protest, which made it difficult for the police to manage the situation. With numbers swelling, police remained silent to avoid confrontation. Holding green flags, farmers walked for about 8km. They shouted slogans that state should have only one capital city not three capital cities. “We have voluntarily given away our green fields for the capital city for the future generations in the state. It is inhumane of the ministers to insult our sacrifices,” said Venkata Lakshmi of Thullur village.

Farmers demanded that the government honour the promises made through LPS Act. CPI national secretary K Narayana alleged that YSRC leaders have set their eyes on the lands in Visakhapatnam and are planning to shift the capital city only to reap rich dividends.

Meanwhile, additional SP Chakravarthi clarified that the women police did not behave harshly with any women protester in Mandadam village two days ago. He said that women protesters had, in fact, had behaved rudely with the cops prompting the latter to take them into custody. He said that police were deployed only for the protection of the people not to harass them. “Police are compelled to act when people do not co-operate with them as per the laws. It is not correct to say that police are depending on the locals for food and water. Our men are making their own arrangements for food,” Chakravarthi said.

BHOPAL: The state BJP on Monday staged protests against attacks on minorities in Pakistan and set the Pakistani flag on fire against the attack on Gurudwara and killing of Sikh community members. BJP leaders claimed that the citizenship law enacted by the Modi government will safeguard the interest of minorities facing torture in countries like Pakistan.

BJP leader and convener of Sadbhavna Manch, Durgesh Keswani, said: ""Frequent attacks on Hindus, Sikhs and other minorities in Pakistan have exposed the brutal face of the neighbouring country. Incidents like attack on devotees in Gurudwara Nankana Sahib , killing of Sikh youths and atrocities committed on Hindus have exposed the pathetic condition in Pakistan. We would like to draw the attention of world towards human rights violation in Pakistan.""

The members of the forum held demonstrations against the incidents in Pakistan and also burnt the Pakistani flag as a mark of protest. Slamming the Congress, BJP state president Rakesh Singh said that those opposing CAA should realise the importance of citizenship law. ""It's shameful to attack devotees in Gurudwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan.

Vijayawada: Hindustan Shipyard Ltd (HSL) is laying the ground to bid for and win the contract to build at least six submarines for Indian Navy , in partnership with Adani group, even as it is focused on completing its pending contracts on time, HSL chairman and managing director Rear Admiral (Retd) LV Sarat Babu said on Monday.

Speaking to TOI from Visakhapatnam, Sarat Babu said HSL has decided ‘in principle’ to set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) with the Adani group. “The decision is in principle because it will have to be approved by the ministry of defence (MoD). Adani group and HSL have not reached a stage to decide on the shareholding in the SPV,” he said, while adding that the partnership is aimed at leveraging its balance sheet.

“Adani group will give us the financial muscle to bid for the six submarines. We would be providing the technical expertise,” he said. Asked whether HSL had the technical expertise to build a highly sophisticated vessel like a submarine , Sarat Babu said the shipyard has a long experience in retrofitting submarines. “We have retrofitted several submarines from scratch, so we have the expertise in what goes into its construction. Some of our competitors have expertise in constructing the hull of the submarine. We will be able to source this expertise as well if we win the contract,” he added.

The six submarines are estimated to cost Rs 50,000 crore. Sarat Babu said besides its technical expertise, HSL has also developed a workforce which can execute the submarine project.

Meanwhile, as it waits for the MoD to release its request for proposal (RfP) for the project, HSL, which was set up in 1941 by Seth Walchand Hirachand, is focused on meeting its other deadlines. “We will be delivering a retrofitted submarine to the Indian Navy on January 31. ahead of schedule. In November, we had delivered two of the last six 10-tonne bollard pull tugs to the Navy two weeks ahead of schedule,” he informed.

277,['7/01/2020'],Six more waste-to-energy plants soon: CM,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Kozhikode: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Monday said that state government plans to construct centralized Waste to Energy (WtE) plants in six more districts in the state.

Addressing the gathering after the work inauguration of the Rs 250 crore WtE plant at Njeliyanparamba, he said that the state government will set up advanced WtE plants in Kollam, Thrissur, Kannur, Thiruvananthapuram, Malappuram and Palakkad districts on Design, Built, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) under public private partnership (PPP) model to resolve existing waste menace. Referring to people’s apprehensions about the proposed WtE plant at Njeliyanparamba, CM said the proposed plant at the Njeliyanparamba is a very advanced one and will generate 6MW of electricity. The generated electricity will be sold to KSEB and the project will be executed as a model project in the state. He said that people will not face any problem due to draining of waste water and foul smell from the plant. The proposed plant will be set up at a cost of Rs 250 crore on 12.67 acres handed over to the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC), nodal agency for the project execution by the corporation. The plant will be first-of-its-kind in the south India. At present, there are four WtE plants in the country, three of them functioning at New Delhi and one at Jamalpur in Bihar. Though the state government has taken initiative to set up a WtE at Brahmapuram in 2016, the plant has not been commissioned so far . The LDF government took steps to set up seven WtE plants across the state and Njeliyanparamba is one among them. Though the original proposal was to construct a WTE plant having capacity to treat 350 tonnes per day at Njeliyanparamba, the revised detailed project report has increased it to 450 tonnes per day. The civic body will supply 200 tonnes of waste per day to the plant making use of its existing waste collection network. The remaining waste will be supplied by the municipalities of Feroke, Koyilandy and Ramanttukkara and municipalities of Kunnamangalam, Kadalundy and Olavanna. KSIDC entrusted Zonta infratech private limited after floating global tender for the project execution. Zonta formed Malabar Waste Management Private Limited for the construction of WtE plant on DBFOT under PPP model and will hand over it to the city corporation after 25 years. The plant construction will be completed within two years. In the initial phase, the company will remove the 1.29 lakh meter cubes of legacy waste piled up at the site using biomining and biocapping methods at a cost of Rs 7.7 crore. Bio-methanation plant will be set up for the disposal of wet waste within a year of commencement of construction work and the plant for the disposal of dry waste will come up in the second phase.

HYDERABAD: In the last three days, three long distance trains — between Hyderabad and Delhi — were inordinately delayed by up to seven hours, courtesy construction activity in the south central railway (SCR) zone. Worse, at least 24 local trains were cancelled or partially terminated, leaving hundreds of travellers inconvenienced.Among the trains that took the beating are: Telangana Express (train no 12724) from New Delhi to Hyderabad that was six-and-half hours late on January 5. On its return journey, (train no 12723) it was delayed by four-and-half hours on Monday. The Karnataka Sampark Kranti Express (train no 12650) from New Delhi to Yesvantpur, via Kacheguda, was also running late on Monday by over four hours. Locally, the trains that were cancelled were from the Secunderabad, Guntur and Nanded divisions.While there were some speculation about weather playing truant, railway sources confirmed the disruptions were because of the construction activity. Furious, many passengers took to social networking sites to express their anguish. Tirupati Bala Singh posted: “@SCRailwayIndia @RailMinIndia @PiyushGoyalOffc: I understnd that weather is the major reason bt this is not the only reason for the extreme 9+hrs delay of this train.

Now, with targets approaching, the authorities have no choice but to speed up the work. Hence, the delays and cancellations are more frequent,” the source added.As per SCR authorities, the zone had set itself a target of building 465 km of track, including doubling or tripling of existing lines, by end of 2020.

Eluru: Superintendent of Eluru Government Hospital, Dr. AVR Mohan, was on Monday suspended after patients complained that he failed to crack the whip on staffers for dereliction of duty.

Vydya Vidhana Parishad commissioner Dr U Ramakrishna issued orders appointing in Mohan’s place senior ophthalmologist Dr AS Ram as incharge superintendent after health minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas asked him to bring erring authorities to book.

Complainants TOI spoke to said several of the government hospital’s staff partied from 11 am to 3 pm earlier this month, ringing in the new year and “felicitating the superintendent”. “Nursing college students, hospital medical officers, staff and workers danced for hours to popular film songs completely ignoring patients and leaving them to their fate,” a patient said. The furious patients and bystanders accused Dr Mohan of doing little to control the revelry or asking the staffers to resume duty.

The issue was brought to the notice of medical and health minister and deputy chief minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas by the attendants of a few patients admitted in the hospital.

The minister then directed the commissioner of AP Vydya Vidhana Parishad to take immediate action against the superintendent if guilty. After conducting inquiry into the matter, the authorities relieved Dr Mohan form duty temporarily.

The patients said the staffers were gone for hours and they were left in the lurch, causing grave inconvenience to most and putting the lives of a few others in danger.

284,['7/01/2020'],Opposition unites for adjournment motion over Mhadei,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Porvorim: Congress , GFP and MGP joined hands with independent MLAs to table an adjournment motion on Tuesday ahead of governor Satya Pal Malik’s customary address before the first assembly session of the year.

The House will meet for a day to pass a central Bill, which allows the continuation of the SC/ST reservation for another 10 years.

The adjournment motion is being moved by the opposition to draw attention to the Mhadei water diversion issue and to corner the government on the floor of the House, said the MLAs.

The adjournment motion, addressed to the assembly secretary, has been moved to “discuss the approval given to Karnataka by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEF&CC) for taking up the so-called drinking water project,” GFP stated in the filed motion.

“This session will continue. It will be adjourned till February 3 and then it will continue. In that session, the budget will be presented,” speaker Rajesh Patnekar said.

He also said that he had not received any adjournment motion or private member’s bill from any of the MLAs.

The second business before the House is a GST amendment. “It should have been passed by December 31 but since the House was not in session, they are taking it up now,” opposition leader Digambar Kamat said, after the meeting of the Business Advisory Committee.

Former transport minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar also declared MGP’s support. Dhavalikar said that 27% water has been diverted by Karnataka from Mhadei river. He also sought a site inspection by the environment ministry to find out the actual situation. “Till date this has not been held. The Mhadei impact would be more than mining,” he said.

GFP and MGP, both former alliance partners of BJP , have alleged that the Pramod Sawant led-BJP government has failed to protect the interest of Goa even as Karnataka has diverted water from the Mhadei river basin.

“The Mhadei issue is a serious issue for which the adjournment motion will be moved. Vijai Sardesai and Dhavalikar came and met me and they suggested that all of us move the adjournment motion together,” Kamat said after a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party.

Just ahead of the Karnataka bypolls, the environment ministry had issued a letter allowing Karnataka to go ahead with the Rs 841 crore Kalsa Bhandura project without an environment impact assessment (EIA). Despite strong objections from Goa, environment and forests minister (MoEF) Prakash Javadekar refused to withdraw the letter issued by the central ministry but recently announced that the letter was being kept in abeyance.

It was GFP which first floated the idea to move an adjournment motion under Section 68 of the Rules of Procedures and Conduct of Business of the House. In order to be valid, the motion needs at least seven members to support the move in the 40-member House. Congress has five MLAs while GFP has three and MGP one. With Khaunte’s support, there are 10 signatories for the adjournment motion.

The primary object of an adjournment motion is to draw the attention of the House to a recent matter of urgent public importance having serious implications on the state. “Mhadei is an issue that requires to be discussed with urgency and for that there must be consensus,” Sardesai had said two days ago.

The adjournment motion says that there is a likelihood of Karnataka misusing the Centre’s approval to divert water from Mhadei into the Malaprabha river which in turn would increase salinity in the Mandovi.

285,['7/01/2020'],"Riders to the sea: After over a year, detained Andhra fishermen to return home tomorrow","This story is from January 7, 2020

Srikakulam: The 22 fishermen from Andhra Pradesh arrested by the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) in November 2018 were handed over to Indian authorities at the Wagah border on Monday. The fishermen are expected to reach Srikakulam on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, at the coastal village of D Matyalesa in Srikakulam district, Nokamma waits for her husband, G Rama Rao, to return. When he was detained 450 km north of Okha off the Arabian Sea in November 2018, Nokamma had been pregnant. She gave birth to a girl in February last year.

On Monday afternoon, however, Nokamma was a happy woman. With her eleven-month-old daughter on her lap, she was watching television when news of the release of the fishermen flashed on a local channel. “I am eagerly waiting to see the reaction of my younger daughter when she sees her father for the first time. We have named her Grishma (summer), but her name will ultimately be decided after my husband comes home ,” she told TOI.

Her neighbour, S Mugathamma, has been alone at home for the last 15 months. Her husband—S Appa Rao—and her sons Kalyan and Kishore had left home in September 2018 and were lodged in a Karachi jail since since November 2018.

Financial support came from her brothers who stay in a neighbouring village and who would also pay her frequent visits. “I thank god that I will soon have my husband and sons with me, but I will not allow them to migrate to Gujarat again. The place has been unlucky for us,” rued Mugathamma.

But for the fishing families of D Matyalesa, migration may not be a choice. The village, which lies on the coast, lacks basic fishing infrastructure like a jetty. Nor do the villagers’ means allow them to buy mechanised boats. Fishermen venture out to sea on small boats and return with a paltry catch. The absence of viable livelihood options has forced their seasonal migration to Gujarat.

Out of a population of 6,000 villagers, over 130 migrate to Gujarat from September to April every year. “Boat owners in Gujarat are well-off. Although it is hard being at sea for eight months, at the end of the month, we get a handsome amount. It is very difficult for us to sustain our familites by fishing only in Andhra Pradesh,” said B Laxman, a boat operator who has been migrating to Gujarat every year for 15 years, and returned early this year to attend a family event.

On Monday, when TOI visited the village, signs of celebration were few and far between. “It is good that the fishermen are returning home after being in custody of a foreign country for more than 12 months,” said Laxman. He explained, “But how will they run their families now? Since they were arrested, their ‘sethji’ (employer) will not pay them any salary. They are coming back without a single rupee and have to start all over again.”

289,['7/01/2020'],SAD wants to fight on seven seats in Delhi,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Chandigarh: BJP ’s alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal ( SAD ) is eyeing seven assembly segments in Delhi, where polling for the 70-member legislative assembly will be held on February 8. The election commission (EC) announced the polling date on Monday.

In the 2013 and 2015 Delhi assembly elections, the Akali Dal had contested four assembly seats — Rajouri Garden, Hari Nagar, Kalkaji and Shahdara. This time, SAD also wants to field its candidates on west Delhi’s Moti Nagar assembly seat, east Delhi’s Rohtas Nagar, and Rajinder Nagar assembly seat under New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency. In the 2013 assembly elections, SAD won only Rajouri Garden seat and in the 2015 assembly polls, it lost all four seats.

SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday constituted a three-member committee, comprising MPs Balwinder Singh Bhundur, Prem Singh Chandumajra and Naresh Gujral. Sukhbir said that the committee would hold discussions with the Delhi BJP unit, as well as, the central leadership to ensure smooth coordination between the alliance partners during the elections.

SAD’s Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa told TOI that party’s Delhi unit has already communicated its recommendation for contesting seven assembly seats to the top leadership, which would now hold discussions with the alliance partner BJP. He said SAD can also clinch Moti Nagar, Rohtas Nagar and Rajinder Nagar assembly seats in the forthcoming elections as there is sizeable population of Sikhs and Punjabi voters in these segments. “We have Gurmeet Singh Shunty in Moti Nagar and Paramjit Singh Rana in Rajinder Nagar, who can be SAD’s strong candidates,” said Sirsa, who is also president of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC).

In the April 2017 bypoll, SAD’s Sirsa registered a win on BJP ticket from Rajouri Garden assembly segment. Rajouri The had fallen vacant as AAP’s Jarnail Singh had resigned to unsuccessfully contest Punjab assembly elections from Lambi constituency against SAD patron Parkash Singh Badal .

Results of the Delhi assembly polls in which a total of 1.46 crore voters are eligible to exercise their franchise would be declared on February 11.

290,['7/01/2020'],Organic certification centres to be functional in all districts by Aug,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Coimbatore: The Tamil Nadu organic certification department (TNOCD) is getting ready to set up organic certification centres in all districts this year.

The centres will be operational by August, TNOCD officials said.

Presently, farmers from across the state have to visit the TNOCD office in Coimbatore to get their fields and produce certified organic. The department had been mulling to start the centres in all districts as more people are getting interested in organic farming. The plan was announced in the assembly last year.

The centres will act as facilitation centres, said an official. “While organic certificates will be issued from the TNOCD office in Coimbatore, farmers and organic agriculture enthusiasts need not come here to get to know about the certification process or to submit forms,” he said.

“It takes half-an-hour to 45 minutes to explain the certification procedure to farmers over phone. Many a time, we request them to come in person to the Coimbatore office so as to guide them better. If the centres are set up in all districts, there will be a better system to guide the newcomers. They can fill in the forms and submit it in their district centres,” said the official.

Organic certification involves two levels. First, inspectors visit fields and verify records such as input register and harvest register. Based on them, farmers are provided a scope certificate, using which they can sell produce directly to consumers.

If farmers seek to market their produce through retailers, they have to subject samples of produce to residual analysis, after which they are issued transactional certificate. Using this, they can label their produce organic and sell through retailers.

Since 2007, when TNOCD was established, till 2017, as many as 480 farmers had got organic certification. In 2018-2019 alone, 100 farmers were certified. Officials attributed this increase to the increase in awareness.

The department of agriculture aims to increase the area under organic cultivation from 25,400 acres to one lakh acres in the current financial year.

VISAKHAPATNAM: With public and private transport off the roads and commercial establishments downing their shutters, normal life was affected due to bandh in all 11 mandals of Vizag Agency on Monday. The call for a two-day bandh—which will last on January 6 and 7—was given by tribals under the banner of Girijana Joint Action Committee (JAC) demanding implementation of AP Scheduled Areas Land Transfer Regulation Act 1959 (Amendment 1/1970), (LTR 1/70). Some tourists were stranded for hours together at Araku Valley and Ananthagiri following disruption of transportation due to the Manyam Bandh.

Stating that the bandh was peaceful on day one, CPM’s Killo Surendra said that LTR 1/70 banned land transactions in tribals pockets, and non-tribals cannot own land in tribal areas. “We are demanding the revenue and ITDA officials take action against the non-tribals who are behind the mushrooming commercial establishments in Vizag Agency and that the non-tribals hand over the establishments to the tribals, who are the true owners of the land the establishments are built on,” Surendra added.

Due to the two-day bandh, majority of the tourists cancelled their bookings and left on Monday. “Very few tourists stayed in Araku Valley. Even the ones who stayed back,remained confined to their rooms,” said K Venkatesh, the owner of a lodge in Araku Valley.

The APSRTC has suspended its bus services and private vehicles were also off the roads on Monday. Managements of private schools and colleges and officials of government schools and colleges announced that Monday and Tuesday would be holidays.

JAC members said that the situation would remain same on Tuesday also and they advised tourists not to visit Araku on Tuesday.

Left parties’ leaders said that despite the growth of tourism in Araku Valley, tribals failed to get any employment as the owners of the resorts and others engaged non-tribals as the staff for their business. Some non-tribals set up the tents in the tribals’ land and by cheating the tribals and enjoying the huge profits as several tourists stay in the rented tents, they added.

Kotwal Nagar resident Saroj Desai composts kitchen waste for her garden plants, adding cow dung-which is a bio... Read More

KOTWAL NAGAR (NAGPUR): I am a resident of Kotwal Nagar. Since I come from a botany background, I believe in the idea of composting to manage kitchen waste in an effective manner. I have been segregating wet and dry waste and processing it to use as compost for plants in my house garden. I have also organized a number of workshops to spread awareness for the same.

The waste collected from my kitchen, like fruit and vegetable peels, eggshells etc is broken into small pieces and dumped in the compost bin. Then, I add the decomposer and cow dung — which is a bio-fertilizer — to accelerate the process. The compost bin is perforated to allow aeration. I keep adding soil to the mixture and stir it regularly. The soil prevents bacteria from breeding and tarnishing the waste.

It takes around 2 to 3 days to collect 2kg of kitchen waste. This waste takes nearly 40 days to convert into compost.

If the compost is slightly dry, one can spray a few droplets of buttermilk on it to restore moisture. During monsoons, the compost mixture tends to become soggy. In this case, dry leaves can be mixed to maintain a balance in the moisture content.

Chemical fertilizers are harmful for plants and the surroundings as well. Their residue may enter our bloodstream and cause cancerous diseases. On the other hand, using organic waste for house plants is good for our health. Also, instead of dumping kitchen waste in a haphazard fashion, we can lessen the burden on NMC.

Everyone must imbibe the habit of segregating their waste at home itself. Non-biodegradable waste like plastic must be recycled. As most households nurture plants, it is better to use green waste that we obtain from the kitchen, instead of buying hazardous chemicals. The philosophy of 4 Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Refuse) is an important one to save the environment.

AMARAVATI: As uncertainty over the fate of Amaravati continues, a section of farmers in the capital city region has floated the idea of building the city along the lines of a cooperative . With no formal announcement yet on the three capital cities proposal, some farmers are of the opinion that taking back land given to the government under the land pooling scheme (LPS) and taking over the planning of the city is the way forward.

Ram Nutakki, a farmer in Thullur mandal, has given a call to farmers of the 29 villages in the capital region to boycott political parties, including YSR Congress (YSRC) and opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP). “Peaceful protests are our democratic right. However, there is no guarantee that our protests will yield results. Instead, we must move in a strategic manner,” he appealed in an open letter to farmers in the region.

The proposal has already drawn the support of one Gadde Butchaiah, a specialist with the United Nations (UN) who comes from a family of cultivators in Rayapudi in Amaravati. Stating that the land pooling scheme initiated by the previous TDP-led state government suffered from inherent flaws, farmers in the region should come together to build a cooperative movement. “Whatever happened, happened. Why should farmers continue to be victims of political one-upmanship?” he said.

Other farmers who support the idea have raised the demand that the government hand back their land. “Let the government shift the secretariat and other departments from Amaravati. We can show the world in Amaravati that building a city through a farmers’ society is a viable option,” said Ram, adding that they would ready master plans for the city by roping in experts and inviting world-class educational institutions.

Local youth would be provided employment in the cooperative-run society, managed by retired IAS and judicial officers, Ram said.

Farmers who gave up their lands under the LPS and other interested farmers would be made stakeholders in the project . The government should hand over construction work in the area to the cooperative or pay rent to it if it is interested in continuing operating the buildings.

Bareilly: Back-to-back murders of three persons, including of two youths within the city limits, in the past 24 hours have sent a shock wave across Bareilly district.

A youth was stabbed to death in the ensuing fight over peeing in the open in Baradari area, while the bullet-ridden body of another youth was found in Subhash Nagar area — both murders took place in Bareilly city — whereas, in a locality close to Faridpur, a guard on the duty at a gurdwara was shot dead by unidentified assailants.

As the murders have cops swung into action and intensified patrolling, Bareilly senior superintendent of police (SSP) Shailesh Pandey ordered all tea stall owners shut by 11pm in a bid to prevent unlawful gatherings.

The first crime was reported around 9.30pm on Sunday. Jugal Kishore, 25, a carpenter hailing from Siklapur locality, along with his friends Kalua and Pradeep, was on his way home after having tea at a tea stall close to their house when Jugal reportedly peed in the open close to a house and in the ensuing fight three locals — identified as Ashwik, alias, Ashu, Manoj and one unidentified person — allegedly stabbed Jugal while Pradeep also sustained injuries in attempt to save his friend.

Upon receiving information, police rushed to the spot and shifted Jugal and Pradeep to a hospital, where the former succumbed to his injuries.

Baradari police station SHO Naresh Tyagi told TOI, “An FIR was registered against all the three accused under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 302 (murder). We will arrest the accused, who are absconding, soon.”

On Monday, Jugal’s family members and neighbours staged a protest by placing his body in the middle of the road and demanding immediate arrest the accused. The protest was lifted only after assurance from senior police officers.

The second murder was reported from Babbanpurva locality under the jurisdiction of Subhash Nagar area, where Jaiwant Dean, a driver, was found shot dead in his bedroom. His father Samuel Chandra Dean informed police about the murder on Monday afternoon.

Police, meanwhile, detained Samuel suspecting him to be the prime suspect. “Samuel delayed in informing police. He quarreled with his son, because he was an alcoholic. Moreover, he was the last person who saw Jaiwant alive” said police sources.

Samuel told TOI, “I had gone to meet another son Jaswant, who lives in Parsa Khera. Upon returning home on Monday, I found Jaiwant dead. Jaiwant was depressed after death of his wife Pinky nearly a year ago. He might have committed suicide”.

Subhash Nagar SHO Harishchandra Joshi said, “We are suspecting his father, because the victim had no enmity with anyone and he used to remain inside his house mostly. His father said Jaiwant might have committed suicide, but we have not recovered the pistol. We are questioning the father and speaking to their neighbours.”

In the third incident, a guard at Dashmesh Gurdwara in Faridpur, Abhi Kuneta (30), was shot dead in the midnight.

Faridpur police station SHO Dhananjay Singh said, “An FIR has been registered against unidentified assailants and police are investigating the case and have detained few suspects for questioning.”

Visakhapatnam: With some of the zilla parishad ( ZPTC ) and mandal parishad territorial constituencies ( MPTC ) seats in scheduled areas of Visakhapatnam district being reserved for non-tribal categories in the ensuing local body elections, tribals in the Agency has decided to launch agitations and threatened to boycott the elections.

In a notification on categorisation, publised a few days ago, the government allocated 10 of the 11 ZPTC seats in Agency mandals to non-tribals, which include four for BCs. Similarly, only four were reserved for MPTCs for tribals.

Speaking to TOI, Killo Surendra of CPM said how can the government promote non-tribals who grabbed land in tribals areas. As per the provisions of the Panchayat Act, reservation in ZPTC and MPTC seats in tribals pockets (scheduled areas) must be in proportion to the population of the communities. In all the 11 tribal mandals in Visakhapatnam Agency, the population of tribals is more, he said.

“We will boycott the elections and intensify our agitation till the government cancels the reservations for the non-tribals in the local body elections in the Agency,” Surendra added. Most tribals leaders are against the move. It will only aggravate ongoing agitation against non-tribals in the Agency, said convener of the joint action committee of Adivasi Hakkula Parirakshana, Samithi Rama Rao Dora. tnn

Visakhapatnam: In a major boost to tourism in Araku Valley, the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) with technical support from Mumbai-based Structwel Designers and Consultants Private Limited is building a craft and culture village, which will allow tourists to take a closer look at the indigenous aspects of the region.

There are several reasons why this project is of importance. First, because it will help generate employment as nearly 90 per cent of the workforce will be drawn from the local population. Second, it adds to the number of tourist attractions in the hill station. Explaining this aspect, APTDC executive engineer D Satyannarayana said, “Till now, people visited nearby tourist spots such as waterfalls, Brindavan Gardens and Chaparai. Except these, there are no major tourist attractions and the project seeks to change that.”

“It is a first-of-its-kind project in the two Telugu states and is unique from the other state tourism projects. It is a part of the corporation’s efforts to develop ‘day life tourism’. It has been taken up at a cost of Rs 7.7 crore,” said DVM Prasada Reddy, Visakhapatam tourism divisional manager.

Protest against attack on JNU students, at Gandhi Park on Monday

Visakhapatnam: Goons belonging to ABVP and RSS attacking students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi with iron rods, sticks and acid was a barbarous act, CPM state secretariat member and former SFI leader Ch Narasinga Rao said on Monday.

SFI Vizag unit staged a protest against the attacks at Mahatma Gandhi statue near GVMC office. Narasinga Rao said the students of JNU had been protesting against indiscriminate fee hike in a peaceful manner. “But some 200 masked goons entered the campus on Sunday night and unleashed violence. In the chaos tens of students suffered severe injuries at the hands of the vandals. BJP murdered the democracy of the country through the heinous act. This is reminiscent of the dark days of Emergency,” said Narasinga Rao. Forum for Development of North Andhra secretary A Aja Sarma alleged the ABVP workers attacked JNU students under the direction of the BJP government.

305,['7/01/2020'],Akal Takht jathedar asks Sikhs to unite ‘for their own safety’,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Amritsar: Claiming that Sikhs were neither safe in India nor Pakistan , Acting Jathedar of Akal Takht Giani Harpreet Singh on Monday called upon the community to come together to end targeting of Sikhs and their religious places.

While talking to media persons, Harpreet Singh said, “In India, Sikhs are being uprooted from Madhya Pradesh and Shillong, while in Pakistan they are scared after the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib attack and killing of Sikh youth Parvinder Singh in Peshawar.”

Continuing in similar vein, he said, “I have no hope that anyone will deliver justice to us, I appeal to Sikhs to unite and only then can we contain such attacks to some extent.” Condemning the back-to-back incidents of attack on a Sikh religious place and targeting of the minority community in neighbouring Pakistan, the jathedar said these unfortunate incidents can't be tolerated.

He said he had spoken to Harmeet Singh, the elder brother of Parvinder Singh over the phone, and the latter had explained the situation in detail. Parvinder was shot dead in Peshawar just two days after the attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib by a local mob.

The jathedar urged the Centre to mount pressure on the Pakistan government to ensure that those responsible for both incidents were given exemplary punishment.

Asked why Sikhs were being targeted, he shot back, “Thieves always steal diamonds and not the pebbles.”

He said he had directed the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) to take up the issue of Pakistan Sikhs’ safety with the Centre.

The Sikh high priest also condemned Sunday’s attack on students and professors at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). “Students protest is natural if they find something going wrong,” he said.

Meanwhile, Harpreet Singh bestowed siropas (robes of honour) on relatives of Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh, assassins of former PM Indira Gandhi, at a SGPC function held at Gurdwara Jhandae Bungae on their death anniversary.

308,['7/01/2020'],23 motorists slapped with Rs 10K fine each for fitting multicolour LED lights,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Coimbatore: The judicial magistrate court-VIII on Monday slapped Rs 10,000 fine on the motorists, who had fitted multicolour LED lights on their vehicles. Of the 23 motorists who faced the court’s wrath, 15 have coughed up the fine.

City police commissioner Sumit Sharan had directed deputy commissioner of police (traffic) R Mutharasu to seize the vehicles that have the lights after it was found that the bright lights affected the vision of other motorists and lead to accidents.

On December 28, traffic police conducted vehicle checks on Avinashi Road, Thadagam Road, Kalappatti Road, Sathy Road and Marudhamalai Road, and seized 52 vehicles including 35 two-wheelers that had the LEDs. The motorists were booked under Section 190 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.

“Fifteen motorists, who paid the fine amount, got their vehicles back on Monday,” Mutharasu said. “The drive against multicolour LED lights will continue and we plan to seize more vehicles in the coming days,” he added.

309,['7/01/2020'],West Bengal: Bird count soars to 5-year high in Santragachhi,"This story is from January 7, 2020

KOLKATA: The early clean-up of Santragachhi Jheel paid rich dividends with a count on Sunday registering the highest number of birds in the past five years.

Ecstatic about the results, conservationists and members of the birder community said Santragachhi Jheel has become a perfect example of how concerted efforts could reverse urban degradation and revive a habitat. The official census will be carried out on January 17.

Even before the count began on Sunday morning, it was clear that the figure would be higher than what had been recorded in the recent past. When the figures were collated, the optimism turned to jubilation.

The count was 5,694 water birds spread across 16 species. What makes Sunday’s count remarkable is that so many birds arrived, despite the cyclone Bulbul and the death of 20,000 migratory birds in October-November 2019.

“With so many birds flocking Santragachhi since early December, we had anticipated more numbers but the figure that finally emerged was beyond expectation. This will not only encourage conservationists like us but also be a huge fillip to stakeholders like South Eastern Railway (SER), Howrah Municipal Corporation ( HMC ), Howrah Police , bird lovers and nature activists,” said Arjan Basu Roy of Nature Mates, who had coordinated the clean-up of the jheel.

West Bengal Biodiversity Board funded the clean-up that saw around 1,500 man-hours being spent between October 28 and November 20 to remove the hyacinth, which had covered 90% of the 13.5 acre jheel. Around 30% of hyacinth cover was retained to enable birds to perch and rest.

An unsupervised clean-up drive by the HMC had removed all the hyacinth, leaving no place for the birds to rest in 2017 when only 800 birds had arrived at the jheel, down from 2,920 the previous year.

Nature Mates had stepped in last year and the sensitive clean-up, assisted by crowd-funding, saw the count rise to 2,889.

Along with the early clean-up of the lake, this year’s cold spell also contributed to the sharp rise in the number of migratory birds. Birds usually arrive when the minimum temperature is around 15-16°C and maximum temperature is under 30°C.

“The return of birds shows that the efforts towards restoring Santragachhi Jheel are moving in the right direction. What is needed next is a comprehensive management plan,” said Kushal Mukherjee of Prakriti Sansad.

A committee comprising representatives of SER, West Bengal Biodiversity Board, HMC, bird lovers and aviation experts has been set up to prepare a five-year management plan for Santragachhi Jheel. The blueprint will chalk out a mid-term and long-term management strategy for the lake that draws thousands of migratory birds every winter.

Amritsar: A day after Pakistan’s political leaders visited at Gurdwara Nankana Sahib to restore the shaken confidence of local Sikh community, senior civil and police officials of Pakistan Punjab made similar attempts. They officials visited Nankana Sahib to sink differences between the two communities that were on brink of clash following attack on Sikhs ’ holy place on Friday.

According to sources, Lahore divisional commissioner Saif Anjum, regional police officer Shiekhupura Farooq Mazhar, Nankana Sahib deputy commissioner Raja Mansoor, Nankana Sahib district police officer Ismael ur Rehman and others visited the gurdwara and interacted with local Sikhs.

On Sunday, Pakistan’s interior minister Brig Ijaj Ahmad Shah (retd) and Pakistan Punjab’s minister for housing Mian Mehmood ur Rashid had visited the gurdwara.

In a video of their visit uploaded on social media, Pakistani pro-Khalistan leader Gopal Singh Chawla was seen welcoming the bureaucrats and informing him about the incident.

Surprisingly, despite being shown the door from the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) and the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), as claimed by Pakistan government, Pakistan’s prominent anti-Indian Sikh face Chawla appears to have been given full authority by Pakistan government to lead the Sikh issues.

Pakisan’s Sikh member provincial assembly (MPA) and parliamentary secretary Mahinderpal Singh told TOI on Monday that Imran Chishti, main accused who had led the mob to attack gurdwara Nankana Sahib, had been arrested. “The most hateful person Imran Chishti, who had tried to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere and communal harmony of Nankana Sahib, has been arrested and an FIR registered against him,” he added.

Sources said fearing regrouping of Muslims under Pakistan’s firebrand, moulvi who in recent past had been spewing venom against India, the local administration of Nankana Sahib has doubled the deployment of forces in the town, especially in the gurdwara vicinity.

Meanwhile, Shiv Sena activists protested against Pakistan government and burnt its effigy in Amritsar.

Amaravati: Notwithstanding the ongoing protests over the proposed shifting of capital city, the government seems determined to move out of Amaravati . The high-power committee, comprising ministers and top officials, will hold its first meeting on Tuesday and study the reports submitted by the GN Rao committee and Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Chief secretary Nilam Sawhney has directed officials to make arrangements for the meeting at the CRDA office. About 10 cabinet ministers, including finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy, municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana, chief secretary Sawhney and DGP Gautham Sawang, are part of the high-power committee.

Sources said the committee is expected to endorse the expert panels’ recommendations and route the same to the cabinet for taking the appropriate decision. Meanwhile, the state cabinet meeting has also been scheduled for Wednesday to discuss the committees’ reports on decentralization of government administration. It is being speculated that the cabinet will stamp its final nod for shifting of capital city to Visakhapatnam at the meeting. The government has also reportedly decided to hold the Republic Day parade in Visakhapatnam as a prelude to the shifting of the administration.

An emergency session of the assembly would be convened either on January 20 or 21 to finalise the decentralization plans. The government wants to ensure that the plans get the stamp of the legislature to avoid any legal complications. Though opposition TDP is expected to oppose the resolution, there should not be any problems in its passing due the YSRC’s overwhelming majority in the House.

Sources further said that some buildings have already been finalised in Visakhapatnam for relocation of offices from Velagapudi. Though a big section of secretariat staffers are believed to be against the shifting plans, the government is counting on secretariat employees’ association president Venkatramireddy to smoothly execute the plans. “We will abide by whatever decision the government takes,” said Venkatramireddy.

According to information, the government has readied a blueprint to shift some key sections from the GAD, home, law, education, panchayat raj, municipal administration, agriculture, industries, IT and transport departments to Visakhapatnam in the first phase.

Visakhapatnam: Digital platforms typically end up becoming the dominant force whichever sector they touch, said Ajay Prakash Sawhney, secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).

He launched the first batch of the postgraduate program in digital governance and management (PGP-DGM) of the Indian Institute of Management-Visakhapatnam on Monday as chief guest. Quoting the staggering growth in the number of UPI transactions over the years, Sawhney said digital platforms sometimes result in the creation of near monopolies. “The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) provided us a fairly conventional and stable banking system by bringing all banking features onto one platform.

The UPI system started its journey in 2016 with just 1 lakh transactions a month, when there were 90 crore debit cards, clocking nearly 32 crore transactions a month. While the number of debit card transactions grew to 42 crore in three years, the UPI transactions recorded a near 11,000 times growth with 110 crore transactions a month. If we get the right policy and instrumentation, the Indian ecosystem will itself unleash exponential growth,” said Sawhney.

319,['7/01/2020'],Three murders in 24 hours rock Bareilly district,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Bareilly: Back-to-back murders of three persons, including of two youths within the city limits, in the past 24 hours have sent a shock wave across Bareilly district.

A youth was stabbed to death in the ensuing fight over peeing in the open in Baradari area, while the bullet-ridden body of another youth was found in Subhash Nagar area — both murders took place in Bareilly city — whereas, in a locality close to Faridpur, a guard on the duty at a gurdwara was shot dead by unidentified assailants.

As the murders have cops swung into action and intensified patrolling, Bareilly senior superintendent of police (SSP) Shailesh Pandey ordered all tea stall owners shut by 11pm in a bid to prevent unlawful gatherings.

The first crime was reported around 9.30pm on Sunday. Jugal Kishore, 25, a carpenter hailing from Siklapur locality, along with his friends Kalua and Pradeep, was on his way home after having tea at a tea stall close to their house when Jugal reportedly peed in the open close to a house and in the ensuing fight three locals — identified as Ashwik, alias, Ashu, Manoj and one unidentified person — allegedly stabbed Jugal while Pradeep also sustained injuries in attempt to save his friend.

Upon receiving information, police rushed to the spot and shifted Jugal and Pradeep to a hospital, where the former succumbed to his injuries.

Baradari police station SHO Naresh Tyagi told TOI, “An FIR was registered against all the three accused under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 302 (murder). We will arrest the accused, who are absconding, soon.”

On Monday, Jugal’s family members and neighbours staged a protest by placing his body in the middle of the road and demanding immediate arrest the accused. The protest was lifted only after assurance from senior police officers.

The second murder was reported from Babbanpurva locality under the jurisdiction of Subhash Nagar area, where Jaiwant Dean, a driver, was found shot dead in his bedroom. His father Samuel Chandra Dean informed police about the murder on Monday afternoon.

Police, meanwhile, detained Samuel suspecting him to be the prime suspect. “Samuel delayed in informing police. He quarreled with his son, because he was an alcoholic. Moreover, he was the last person who saw Jaiwant alive” said police sources.

Samuel told TOI, “I had gone to meet another son Jaswant, who lives in Parsa Khera. Upon returning home on Monday, I found Jaiwant dead. Jaiwant was depressed after death of his wife Pinky nearly a year ago. He might have committed suicide”.

Subhash Nagar SHO Harishchandra Joshi said, “We are suspecting his father, because the victim had no enmity with anyone and he used to remain inside his house mostly. His father said Jaiwant might have committed suicide, but we have not recovered the pistol. We are questioning the father and speaking to their neighbours.”

In the third incident, a guard at Dashmesh Gurdwara in Faridpur, Abhi Kuneta (30), was shot dead in the midnight.

Faridpur police station SHO Dhananjay Singh said, “An FIR has been registered against unidentified assailants and police are investigating the case and have detained few suspects for questioning.”

Chandigarh: A midnight swoop by Haryana power minister Ranjeet Singh Chautala on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday detected power theft by the higher ups at Thermal Power Colony of Panipat Thermal Power Plant (PTPP).

As many as eight top officials, who include the head of PTPP chief engineer, seven superintending engineers and principal of DAV School Thermal colony were found to be stealing power by puncturing the lines of street lights.

According to information, Chautala quietly checked into the guesthouse where teams from CM flying squad, vigilance wing of Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN) were already present.

Sources informed that the operations began at at 10.30pm and went on till 2am. The entire staff submitted its report to minister.

Sources also said the staff of sub-divisional office concerned of Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam is gathering data of daily consumption by the errant officials and the electricity bills paid by them. Consequently, the officials will be penalised and will be asked to deposit the fine with immediate effect.

Chautala confirmed the raid by his team. “We shall submit the report to CM. He has to take the call,’’ he said.

Meanwhile, when contacted, UHBVN chairman-cum-managing director Shatrujeet Singh Kapoor said that the defaulters of power theft officers are faced with action as it happens in the case of common man.

“We have standard operative procedure in the cases of power theft. These are compoundable offences. Besides penalty prepared by the field officials, the errant persons are faced with criminal action as well. This colony comes under the jurisdiction of HPGCL, hence their MD too might take administrative action against the offenders,’’ said Kapoor.

This is not the first such instance, we had been detecting power thefts at government colonies and have been acting against them, he added.

Coimbatore: For the first time this year , the Samagra Shiksha for secondary level school education would give aid and equipment individually to disabled students and students with learning disabilities from government and government aided schools of classes IX to XII, under the Inclusive Education for Disabled at Secondary Stage (IEDSS) scheme.

While disabled students from classes I to VIII get their aid individually, students from secondary schools don’t. The Samagra Shiksha for secondary level purchases equipment for its special training centres through the district administration. The equipment would be common for students taught through these centres. But now, officials said they have given requirements for individual students.

An official said Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India (Alimco) would give the equipment for the students at 60% subsidy, while Samagra Shiksha would put in the rest. This year, 48 students with various disabilities would receive equipment such as wheelchairs, hearing aid, cerebral palsy chairs, rollators, knee ankle foot orthosis (KAFO) and ankle foot orthosis (AFO), elbow crutches, braille kits, and multi-sensory inclusive educational (MSIED) kits.

“We would put in Rs 1.22lakh for purchasing these equipment. Alimco would give us the equipment in subsidized rates,” the official said. He said they had conducted a medical camp to identify students with disabilities. “Usually these camps would be conducted for students from classes I to VIII. This time we also held a camp for students from classes IX and above. Unidentified disabled students in lower classes will also benefit from the scheme,” the official said.

For disabled children in secondary schooling, there are 19 special training centres with 21 special educators in 15 blocks of the district. A total of 656 disabled students benefit from these centres. The students go to regular schools and once in a week visit these centres where special educators would teach them. Depending on the students’ disability, he or she can visit the centres for more number of times, the official said.

A special educator from the district said if students get individual braille kits or walkers, they would be benefitted more. “We teach physiotherapy exercises in our centres. If students have a walker at their home, they can practise it there,” she said.

323,['7/01/2020'],Dalit basti in Kotputli to boycott panchayat polls,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Representative image

JAIPUR: At least 88 families, with a population of nearly 500, of a Dalit basti , named Rangaura (Ambedkar Colony), under Sundarpura village in Kotputli will boycott the panchayat elections scheduled on February 1. The families are going to boycott elections for not having a link/public road to connect their basti with Sundarpura village.

The residents complain that neither ambulances nor midday meal, to be distributed to the children at the Angawadi centre, could reach their basti because of no connectivity. “Children living in the basti have to walk 2-3 kms to reach their schools in Kotputli. We have to carry the patients on our shoulders or on the bike to reach the hospital (in Kotputli). In cases of deaths too, since there is no crematorium or burial ground here, the bodies are carried on the shoulders to Sundarpura,” said Kailash Chand Arya, who runs a private school in the basti.

“In 1962, the government had allotted land for a colony for people belonging to Dalit community. But, since then no public/link road has been constructed for us to connect with Sundarpura village. The colony is surrounded by agricultural lands and the farmers, who owns the land, had blocked the way to enter the Dalit basti with wire fencing and boulders. Even as the distance is just 500 metres, nothing has been done so far,” said Arya.

Most of the residents at Rangaura basti are daily wage labourers. Some of them work at the Anganwadi centre, community centre and primary school that is being run in the colony (basti). “There are about 300 voters in this basti. We all will boycott panchayat elections this time,” he added.

A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the Rajasthan High Court last year pleading with the court to direct the state government to construct a public road/aam rasta to connect Rangaura Basti with Kripa Ka Tibara Village, Sundarpura link road, by acquiring private land for the public purposes.

A division bench of the high court had asked the petitioners in August 2019 to approach district collector, Jaipur, by way of filing detailed representation mentioning all the facts mentioned in the petition along with all the relevant documents, who shall have the grievances of the petitioners examined by deputing SDO or tehsildar concerned to enquire into the matter and do the needful in accordance with law or otherwise decide the representation by passing speaking order within a period of three months from the date of filing of the representation.

Following which on August 26, Jaipur district collector had directed the sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Kotputli tehsil to take appropriate action in the matter within 15 days and send a report to the collectorate. A report was sent to the collectorate by the SDO in October, 2019. But no action has been taken after that.

One of the two-wheelers which was hit by the BMTC bus on Monday.

Bus driver brought faulty brake to manager’s notice 15 days ago

Chaos on Magadi Road

2 officials suspended

BENGALURU: After its brakes failed, a BMTC bus ploughed through eight vehicles, killing two men and injuring three others before ramming a Metro barricade and coming to a halt near Kottigepalya, Magadi Road, west Bengaluru, on Monday morning.The bus dragged a car, an autorickshaw and six other vehicles for 200 metres down an inclined stretch. Bus driver Venkatesh, arrested and booked for causing death due to negligence and rash driving, said he had informed his depot manager that its brakes were weak and had to be fixed a fortnight earlier.The bus, plying on route 245-M, was going from Vaddarahalli to Majestic when the accident occurred around 9.30am. Venkatesh averted a bigger tragedy by avoiding ramming a congregation of 500 devotees in front of Mutturayaswami temple waiting for darshan on the occasion of Vaikunta Ekadashi.Ramakant U, who was on the bus, said, “The driver told the conductor that the brakes were not working and effectively cut the speed of the vehicle. If he had swerved left, he would have hit the devotees. He took a sharp right turn. Since the bus could not climb up a heap of mud on the margins of the road, it began knocking down other vehicles on the road.”Venkatesh succeeded in his second attempt to make the climb and ram the barricades before stopping the bus.The driver of the BMTC bus (KA 57-F-696), which mowed down two bikers on Magadi Road on Monday morning, told police that his depot manager forced him to take out the vehicle though its brake was weak and could fail any time.“The brake was weak and I had been complaining about it for 15 days. But my manager never heard my pleas and I was forced to drive the same vehicle,” Venkatesh told police.Joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda said probe will be carried out by a police officer of the rank of assistant commissioner of police. “We have recorded Venkatesh’s statement about the depot manager’s callousness. We will do the investigation and book the manager, if he is found to be guilty,” he added.A road user said the bus suddenly began moving in a zig-zag manner while going down an inclined stretch. “It was a terrifying sight. After ramming the vehicles, it halted near the barricade. First, we dragged the mangled car and autorickshaw to the side, thinking there could someone inside. Luckily, the drivers of these vehicles were thrown out due to the impact of the collision. Then we found two bikers lying on the road. One had died instantly, while the other was gasping for breath. He died while being stretchered into the ambulance,” the eyewitness, who helped clear the vehicles and shift the injured to hospital, said.The deceased are M Bylappa, 43, of Magadi Road and Vishwaradhya, 48, of Sunkadakatte. While Bylappa worked as an assistant at the General Post Office, Vishwaradhya worked as a teacher with a private high school near Byadarahalli.Cabbie Nagaraj, 34, and private company employees Abhishek, 23, and Harshit, 28, suffered injures and were rushed to a nearby hospital. The injured are stable and undergoing treatment.“The driver claims to have written in the logbook about the faulty brake. But there are possibilities of the logbook being tampered by the mechanical staff. A thorough investigation will reveal the exact cause. Often mechanical staff cite low availability of spare parts as an excuse. Senior depot officials should be made accountable for these accidents,” a senior BMTC official said.BMTC sources say they have a logbook, where bus crew reports defects in buses, including brake, radiator and electrical parts at the end of the duty. The mechanical department staff is responsible for attending to such complaints before the next trip.BMTC managing director C Shikha said they have formed a special team to investigate the case. “We are looking at various angles and the real cause of the accident. We are yet to question the driver as he is still in police custody.”The mishap on busy Magadi Road threw peak-hour traffic into disarray. With policemen in the area deployed for Vaikunta Ekadashi duty at temples, there was none to clear the traffic pile-up. The snarl lasted for over an hour.The vehicle was operated by driver Venkatesh and conductor Neelamma Hiremath. An inquiry into the accident is pending and depot manager Shivalingaiah and assistant work superintendent Madhusudhan have been suspended. An ex-gratia amount of Rs 25,000 will be given to the next of kin of the two dead men. BMTC will bear the cost of treatment of those injured.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73131784,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-166488,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/driver-brought-faulty-brake-to-managers-notice-15-days-ago/articleshow/73129406.cms

CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora has directed all the deputy commissioners (DCs) to work on priority basis to provide 55 litres of pure drinking water per person per day in rural households, under Jal Jeevan Mission, so that the target of providing 100% Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) in every rural household can be completed by June 30, 2022.

The chief secretary gave these directions on Monday during a review meeting of the ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’ with senior officers and DCs via video conferencing.

She instructed the officers to conduct a survey in rural areas to get complete information about the households getting piped water and those with illegal water connections. The survey results will then have to be matched with billing information system for water and sewerage data, she said and added that Suksham Yuvas should be involved in the task.

Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, to provide Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC), road cut charges of Rs 2,000 have been waived off by the government and households would be provided two options — either to pay Rs 500 upfront as new connection charges and or pay Rs 50 (ie Rs 40 flat rate + Rs 10 extra) for general connection and Rs 30 (ie Rs 20 flat rate +Rs 10 extra) for SC connection, as per prevailing government tariff. in this way, payment of Rs 500 as connection fee would be collected, Arora said.

According to the 2011 Census, Haryana has a total of 31.32 lakh houses in rural area and on the basis of survey data, 16.67 lakh houses have functional household tap connections and the survey of the remaining 14.56 lakh houses will be completed by March 31, this year.

Under the scheme, a three-phase action plan has been prepared to provide 100% functional household tap connections by 2022. In the first phase, 22.07 lakh houses will be provided tap connections by September 30, 2020. In the second phase, 25.2 lakh houses and in the third phase, 31.32 lakh houses will be provided tap connections.

328,['7/01/2020'],"Gaganyaan mission: Gagannauts can choose from biryani, suji halwa &amp; more","This story is from January 7, 2020

BENGALURU: From suji halwa to chicken biryani, a menu of about 30 dishes has been readied for astronauts proposed to be sent to space as part of India’s first human spaceflight mission ( Gaganyaan ). The menu will now be evaluated by the Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) and the astronauts.

The special ready-to-eat dishes — an elaborate spread ranging from fruit juices to energy bars and regular Indian cuisines — are being developed by the Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL), a Mysuru-based lab under the Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ).

DFRL director Anil Semwal told TOI: “It’s now for them (Isro and astronauts) to finalise which dishes they would like and then we can even make modifications. Apart from the food, we are also tasked with providing food-warmer technology, stainless steel cutlery and a waste disposal pack.”

Confirming this, Isro chairman K Sivan said Isro has funded a part of this specific project — DFRL has been working on ready-to-eat food for the armed forces for decades — and that Gaganyaan astronauts will be using Indian food when they go to space. “We are not depending on Russia for this. We are in the process of evaluating the dishes,” he said.

Another DFRL official said among the challenges faced is the modification needed in packaging. “We have to modify the packaging to suit the no-gravity situation in space. Whenever food is removed from the packet, there’s a possibility of it escaping into the space capsule, which has to be avoided. Also, there are chances of water molecules escaping into the space shuttle and because there’s no gravity, they will start floating around,” the official said.

Semwal said among the dishes developed by DFRL are chapatis, chicken biryani, suji halwa, chicken curry, almonds, spinach and paneer.

“The number of astronauts doesn’t concern us as we do research. We are developing the products keeping in mind the Indian palate, the kind of spiciness required and so on,” the DFRL official said, adding that the standards used to develop these products are that of US space agency NASA .

Human space facility at Challakere

Isro is planning a massive facility at Challakere in Chitradurga district to carry out future human spaceflight mission activities. While the first mission under this programme is Gaganyaan, which envisages sending humans to space and bringing them back safely in 2022, Isro will continue the programme thereafter.

The space agency has begun work on the masterplan for this facility. The Human Space Flight Centre, which is implementing Gaganyaan and is responsible for future human space programmes, is currently headquartered in Bengaluru.

This will eventually be shifted to Challakere, and all astronaut and human spaceflight-related activities will be housed there.

HYDERABAD: Months after sacking six teachers of Telangana State Model Schools for taking unauthorised long leaves, the state has now sacked another 14 teachers working in government schools for being AWOL (absent without leave) for a period ranging up to 14 years.

The commissioner and director of school education (C&DSE) T Vijaya Kumar said that they have terminated the services of these teachers as per procedure. “Disciplinary proceeding against another 92 teachers are under process,” said Kumar adding that action will be initiated against them as per procedure.

The issue of 106 teachers being AWOL came to light in September 2019, after the various district education officers (DEOs) sent in their reports to the C&DSE. The director then directed the regional joint directors (RJDs) and district education officers (DEOs) to initiate action against the concerned teachers and submit a compliance report.

As per the rules, an employee cannot stay away from his/her duty without the sanction of leave from the competent authority. In such cases where the government servant is absent from duty wilfully, without any grant of leave, he/she is liable to be removed from service.

District education officer (DEO) of Hyderabad, B Venkata Narasamma, said of these teachers, two of them are working in schools in Hyderabad district. “In another two to three days, seven more teachers will be sacked,” Narasamma said adding that in the district there are teachers who are on authorised leaves for a period ranging from one year to 14 years.

The DEO said that despite sending notices, the teachers had failed to respond or submit an explanation. She added that a majority of these teachers had moved to some other country and added that the education department had details from the bureau of immigration to prove their case. Of the 14 teachers who have been sacked, three each are from Nagarkurnool and Karimnagar, two each are from Hyderabad, Jagtial, and Kamareddy, and one each from Khammam and Nirmal.

CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury

NEW DELHI: The clamour for the immediate sacking of JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar grew louder on Monday with JNU alumnus and CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury leading the charge and accusing Kumar of “complicity” in orchestrating the violent attacks on students and teachers of the varsity.

CPM alleged Kumar had allowed the rampage against students to continue on the premises, adding that the Union home minister owed it to students and the public to fix accountability and punish those responsible for the vandalism and violence . “JNU teaches a very deep commitment to democracy and secularism,” Yechury said.

“The VC, who has been instrumental in systematically undermining and dismantling India’s premier university, had permitted this rampage to go on unchecked for hours...Sacking the VC is essential for restoring normalcy on campus,” CPM said.

Party MP Elmaram Kareem also petitioned the President of India to intervene immediately and “sack the VC to ensure that normalcy prevails on campus.”

BENGALURU: Angry over being fired, a former staffer sought to cast a black magic spell on his employer in Kurubarahalli, Mahalakshmipuram, northwest Bengaluru.

It began last week when the owner of Bhuvaneshwari Hardware, Vishwanath, fired his assistant, Srinivas, on suspicion of theft. A resident of Gelayara Balaga, Srinivas, in his late 20s, had joined the shop in mid-2019.

Srinivas, after being fired, told Vishwanath that he would not repeat the mistake and sought another chance. However, Vishwanath did not budge.

“Vishwanath opened the shop on Sunday morning and found vermilion, lemon, hair, nails and torn footwear, indicating that someone had performed black magic. Footage from CCTV camera in front of the shop showed Srinivas throwing away the material earlier in the morning,” neighbouring shop owners said.

Vishwanath promptly cleaned up the place and threw the black magic material into a drain, they added. No complaint has been filed, Mahalakshmi Layout police said.

Hyderabad: The Telangana Information Technology Association (Tita) on Monday began a pilot project for introducing coding in schools. The six-day programme is being held in 18 government schools in Makhtal constituency across Wanaparthy district.

“Two students one from class 8 and another from class 9 and one teacher from the school will be trained in Scratch programming and Phython language for artificial intelligence,” Tita global president Sundeep Kumar Makthala said and added that they were using unique methods such as helping students understand concepts through the use of legos.

Makthala said Tita will prepare a report on the outcomes and make recommendations to the government to scale up the programme and introduce coding in schools from the next academic year. IT Minister K T Rama Rao has asked departments of school education and IT to collaborate and devise a programme to introduce coding at school level. The objective is to ensure that students are exposed to possibilities and careers in coding.

“Students are excited. In fact, we found many girls participating. Many were reluctant to leave the campus even after 5pm,” said mandal education officer, Bhasker Singh.

Rohtak: Former Haryana chief minister OP Chautala on Monday said the present regime of the BJP and the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) formed two months ago would not survive for long as it lacked proper co-ordination and matching of ideologies.

Predicting mid-term polls, Chautala, who was in Rohtak on Monday, claimed that since there was no co-ordination between the BJP and the JJP that has formed alliance to run the government, it would fall soon.

“Such government does not run for long time that is formed by political parties lacking proper understanding and co-ordination. All sections of society are facing hurdles in this government,” he added.

Training guns at JJP leader Dushyant Chautala, Chautala said youths were roaming jobless in this regime while it had promised to give jobs to every unemployed by going door to door. He claimed that his party, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), was the only political party that had always honoured its commitment.

Meanwhile, former CM and main opposition leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who was also in Rohtak, supported INLD supremo O P Chautala’s claim of mid-term polls by saying that there was always a possibility in politics.

“If Chautala has issued such a statement, he must have made observation after proper analysis. To me, no possibility can be ruled out in politics and everything is possible,” Hooda added.

Hitting on the BJP-JJP government, Hooda said on one side Maharashtra coalition government had started working on their common minimum program, on the other the BJP-JJP government was yet to form its common minimum program. On the hike of Rs 250 in social security pension, Hooda said it was no achievement by the government as it had hiked only Rs 50 additionally.

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday sought to know from the state its policy to deal with missing children . The court also asked the state how it dealt with other states when it came to handing over rescued children to their native places.The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy issued notices to the state and its authorities following a PIL filed by advocate Rapolu Bhaskar who urged the court to look at the numbers of missing children in the state, which rose by 2,000 between 2015 to 2018. He also urged the court to take cognisance of the alleged manner in which the police were closing cases without tracing the children.“Bihar was refusing to accept its children even when they were rescued by other states like Rajasthan. This is because the state has to pay to the parents Rs 20,000 for each rescued child,” the bench said and added it was alarming that due to this, rescued children are unable to reunite with their parents.“When several tribal girls from Rajasthan were rescued in Gujarat, that (latter) state had made a false claim that the girls came on their own in search of employment. No tribal girl from Rajasthan would go to Gujarat for employment. They were trafficked into prostitution. The state of Gujarat had given a wrong explanation,” the bench said and added that many were being trafficked to other major cities.The bench sought to remind state counsel, T Srikanth Reddy, representing the home department that human trafficking is happening for two purposes. “If it is girls, they are trafficked into prostitution. If its boys, they are turned into bonded labourers,” the bench said while asking the state counsel the number of bonded labourers the state has. “How many are from Telangana and how many of them are from other states?” the bench asked.“Unless you raid brothel houses, you will not know the details of the victims. Jodhpur is a conduit point in Rajasthan. Similarly several states have exit points to traffic children. Most of them situated at the borders and trafficked kids are usually from the tribal and other weaker communities,” the bench said and asked the state to conduct a sociological survey of the rescued and missing children.The bench, while tagging a PIL filed by Prajwala to the current PIL, requested senior counsel L Ravichandar to assist as amicus curiae. It also sought counters from the state mainly from the home and labour departments. “Don’t be bureaucratic in your approach and file sensible counters,” Chief Justice Chauhan said while posting the case to February.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73133016,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-346588,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-to-state-what-is-your-policy-to-rehabilitate-missing-children/articleshow/73129374.cms

HYDERABAD: The prosecution in the Hajipur rape and murder cases has sought death penalty for the accused, 28-year-old Marri Srinivas Reddy . It urged the court to consider it as a ‘rarest of the rare’ case. “Under the Pocso Act, the accused deserves death penalty and no mercy should be given to him,” the prosecution argued in the court on Monday. The prosecution said under the Supreme Court guidelines, rape and murder of a minor girl by an accused should be considered as the rarest of rare case deserving death by hanging.

“To satisfy his carnal desires, he killed the girl,” the prosecution said and added that persons like Srinivas were a danger to society. “The case should not just be seen as another crime but a disease in the society. The accused showed no mercy on his victim and killed her. Hanging him to death is a well-deserved punishment and will also act as a deterrent to others,” the prosecution said.

Srinivas, a lift mechanic, was arrested on April 30 last year in connection with the crime. The girl had gone missing on April 25 and a police complaint had been lodged the same day. Her body was found in an agricultural well belonging to the accused the next day. Police have also accused him of committing rape and murder of two more girls.

The prosecution will present its case in connection with the rape and murder of a 17-year-old girl and a 11-year-old girl in the court on Tuesday. The crimes were committed in Hajipur village of Bommalaramaram mandal in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district.

The accused has already denied his involvement in the cases by telling the court that he was framed. He said last week that he was impotent and that he did not have a smartphone as police had presented it as an evidence to show that he was addicted to porn and also the photographs of the girls were found on his cellphone.

Visakhapatnam: Indian Institute of Management-Visakhapatnam (IIM-V) will launch two new doctoral programmes this year in decision sciences and marketing. A notification to this effect will be released in the next few days.

Declared as an Institution of National Importance, the institute started its first batch of Fellow Programme in Management, leading to the awarding of PhD in finance and accounting and production and operations management in 2019. Now, the IIM-V will add these two new doctoral programmes to its bouquet of courses.

The usual duration of FPM is five years, comprising two years of course work, an examination and thesis work. The Indian Institutes of Management Bill, 2017, which came into effect from January 2018, allows IIM-V to award PhD degrees instead of the earlier Fellow Programme in Management (equivalent to PhD) offered by the IIMs. Speaking to TOI, director of IIM-V, Prof M Chandrasekhar said IIM-V is keen on building its identity as a knowledge entity, focusing on research of high quality and large impact.

“IIM-V believes that the new doctoral programmes will advance knowledge and innovation in management theory and practice. We want to start the new doctoral programmes by having at least two candidates in each FPM discipline. In the context of new challenges emerging in the business and non-business organisations, the research programmes will groom the research scholars to conduct cutting-edge research and emerge as innovative solution providers” said Prof Chandrasekhar.

Explaining the benefits offered under the FPM programme, Prof Chandrasekhar said the PhD students will be offered Rs 30,000 monthly stipend for the first two years and Rs 33,000 for the remaining three years. “They will be offered a startup grant of Rs 50,000 in the first year and Rs 25,000 annual contingency grant to purchase books, out-of-station visits for data collection and other research-related work. They can attend two international conferences and three national conferences and the expenditure will be borne by the institute,” he said.

Meanwhile, the IIM-V introduced two foreign languages, German and Spanish, as part of its flagship postgraduate programme in management programme this year. While 40 students opted for Spanish, 15 students chose German as part of the course.

338,['7/01/2020'],Cows in 300 Pilibhit villages to undergo artificial insemination,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Pilibhit: The animal husbandry department in Pilibhit has launched a project to artificially inseminate cows and buffaloes in 300 villages which have considerable population of milch cattle.

Under the plan, which is an integral part of the Union government’s ‘Rashtriya Gokul Mission’, the artificial insemination facility is to be provided to beneficiaries at their doorstep free of cost.

“The plan is aimed at improving the breed of nondescript indigenous cows which have come to the brink of extinction as their keepers have developed a tendency to abandon them due to their low capacity of milk production,” said Dr Gyan Prakash Singh, chief veterinary officer (CVO) at Pilibhit.

As per the latest census of milch cattle, the district has 1.65 lakh cows and 2.70 lakh buffaloes. Of these, the cows of indigenous species comprise nearly 40 to 50 thousand. The district had been assigned a target of inseminating 20,000 cows and buffaloes by March 31, said the CVO.

“We have deployed one artificial insemination worker (AIW) in each of the 300 selected villages who will carry the frozen semen of enriched species of bulls using liquid nitrogen to maintain the prescribed temperature and to keep it safe. The AIW will visit door to door in the villages and will provide three free cycles of artificial insemination to one cow. Even if the cow or buffalo fails to conceive, the keeper concerned will be advised to bring the cattle to the nearest veterinary hospital for proper medical checkup and treatment,” said Singh.

This plan will bring about a revolutionary change in milking capacity of indigenous species of cows and buffaloes, he explained.

The report of artificial insemination is to be uploaded daily on the prescribed website of the Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) or else the performance of the district will be counted as zero, he pointed out.

Meanwhile, marginal and small farmers have welcomed the scheme. “The plan will save us from meeting the cost of artificial insemination as well as transporting the cattle to centre concerned,” one of them said.

“Had it not been for the bravery of Gen. Suleimani and his companions, Syria and Iraq would have fallen into the hands of ISIS long ago. US action to assassinate this brave commander reflects the nation’s hollow slogans and false claims to fight terrorism,” the consulate’s statement said.

PM Narendra Modi

NEW DELHI: In a departure from previous polls, BJP is set to contest the Delhi assembly elections without naming its chief ministerial candidate as the party seeks votes in the name of PM Narendra Modi and the performance of the central government under him.

“I am confident that through this 'mahaparva' (festival) of democracy, people will choose the government which fulfils the aspirations of the people of Delhi under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi by defeating those who misled them for five years by making only hollow promises,” BJP chief Amit Shah tweeted.

Shah’s mention of the PM, whom he has been repeatedly invoking while seeking votes in Delhi, makes it obvious that the party is banking heavily on Modi’s charisma to repeat its performance in the Lok Sabha polls, in which BJP had registered a clean sweep winning all seven seats.

There was speculation about the party naming one of its Delhi leaders as its chief ministerial candidate. However, party sources said it was decided to wait for the polls to be over.

BJP had named Sushma Swaraj as its face in 1998 followed by V K Malhotra (2003, 2008), Harsh Vardhan (2013) and Kiran Bedi (2015). However, the party’s decision to name Bedi as its CM candidate was seen as one of several factors that led to its defeat as a section of party leaders was unhappy at the decision.

BJP has launched its campaign in the national capital and is leaving no stone unturned to win the polls with Modi and Shah leading from the front. Hoardings depicting legalisation of unauthorised colonies, a key poll plank of the party, have been put up in large numbers with photographs of Modi, who addressed a huge rally at Ramlila ground recently.

BJP is hoping to repeat its Lok Sabha polls feat of 2019 when it had bagged 57% votes. The party believes the decision to confer ownership rights to residents of unauthorised colonies will help it win over people living there. The party claims the decision will benefit up to five million people.

HYDERABAD: By roping in half a dozen ministers and scores of leaders for campaigning for the January 22 civic elections, TRS is leaving no stone unturned to capture civic bodies in Medchal-Malkajgiri district. Reason: The semi-urban area has four municipal corporations and nine municipalities, making it the only district with four municipal corporations in its jurisdiction, and poll outcome has a direct bearing on three Assembly constituencies of Greater Hyderabad.TRS sources said special focus on campaigning in the district has been given as it encompasses Medchal, Kukatpally and Qutbullapur Assembly constituencies, which are part of the Malkajgiri parliamentary constituency represented by Congress MP A Revanth Reddy. TRS leadership reportedly told minister Ch Malla Reddy, who hails from the district, that the party should win all 13 urban bodies (4 corporations and 9 municipalities) in the district without giving any scope to either Congress or BJP.The sources said though Malla Reddy wields considerable influence in the district, the party wants to deploy other minsters too to address people at the hustings. The first round of preparatory meetings was held at Boduppal, Jawaharnagar and Medchal. Ministers from the district, Sabita Indra Reddy, A Indrakaran Reddy and T Harish Rao also participated in the meetings. Though Harish Rao is in-charge minister of the erstwhile Medak district (now Medak, Siddipet and Sangareddy districts), the party has decided to utilise his services in Medchal too.The party’s earlier strategy was to confine ministers to their respective districts, but in Medchal, Harish Rao and other ministers have been asked to campaign on the invitation of Malla Reddy when and wherever required. Municipal minister KT Rama Rao , who said he would be campaigning in his pocket borough, Sircilla constituency, might participate in meetings and road shows in Medchal district. He had participated in road shows in the Malkajgiri Lok Sabha constituency during the Lok Sabha elections in May, 2019.“We are ahead of other parties with regard to campaigning. The first round of canvassing has been completed. Our party wants to reach each and every voter and tell them about the welfare schemes being implemented by the government such as Kalyana Lakshmi, Shaadi Mubharak or housing scheme. Every household has benefited from one government scheme or the other, which might turn the tide in our favour during the municipal elections,” TRS parliamentary party incharge Marri Rajasekhar Reddy told TOI.Since internecine wars might damage party’s prospects in elections, TRS is worried about differences between minister Malla Reddy and former Medchal MLA M Sudheer Reddy. Chief minister and TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao has already warned Sudheer Reddy and directed him to work with the minister. Sources said Sudheer Reddy has been reportedly seeking seats for his followers in the Medchal assembly constituency, which he had represented earlier.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73133688,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-119627,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-sets-eyes-on-medchal-malkajgiri/articleshow/73129522.cms

MOHALI: Immense cold wave and bad weather conditions have stalled the demolition of 83 odd illegal structures by the Mohali administration .

“Zirakpur municipal council (MC) is yet to seek police protection to conduct the drive,” said Sukhvinder Singh Randhawa, executive officer (EO).

He said, “We have decided to defer the demolition drive due to immense cold wave conditions and bad weather. We do not want anyone to be displaced from their dwellings in adverse weather conditions. We will also write a letter to the SSP Mohali seeking security cover which may take a week or 10 days after which the demolition will be carried out.”

Following the high court orders, the Mohali administration had issued notices to the owners of 83 such structures, which have been constructed within the radius of 100 metres from the boundary wall of the defence installation, giving them two-week time till January 7.

Earlier, 15 days’ notice was given to 98 owners of illegal structures falling within the radius of 100-metre vicinity of the airport boundary wall under the Works of Defence Act, 1903, on September 18 following orders of the Punjab and Haryana high court to carryout demolition of illegal structures constructed after March 9, 2011, at Bhabat village and after March 11, 2011, at Jagatpura village in the vicinity of the Air Force station, Chandigarh. All such structures have been termed illegal under the Works of Defence Act, 1903. The high court had ordered to carry out demolition following due course of law.

Out of the 98 owners of the illegal structures who were issued notices earlier, 65 have not disputed the position that their structures have been raised after the public notice of March 9, 2011. Of these, 16 have not been able to substantiate their claim that their structures were existing prior to the said date.

The remaining 16 owners were able to adduce evidence that their structures were existing prior to March 9, 2011. One referred owner had submitted that his structure was outside the 100-metre periphery. Therefore, all the remaining 81 structures are raised in contravention of the Act, therefore, they are liable to be demolished since their action of raising the same were illegal, there is no question of paying any compensation qua the structure, rather they may be liable for paying the cost of demolition leaving 83 structures to face immediate demolition.

345,['7/01/2020'],"Bellandur, Varthur lake silt to go to farmers, brick kilns","Foaming at Bellandur and Varthur lakes has often made global headlines in the past years.

BENGALURU: The National Green Tribunal-mandated revival of Bellandur and Varthur lakes is set to enter a crucial stage: desilting . Farmers and residents looking for manure for their fields and gardens, and brick kilns in need of raw material, are set to be the beneficiaries.While farmers will get the silt for free, BDA, custodian of the two lakes, is yet to work out the modalities of charging residents and brick kilns.Foaming at Bellandur and Varthur lakes, spread over 516 acres and 17 guntas and 439 acres 34 guntas, respectively, has often made global headlines, prompting NGT to virtually steer and oversee revival efforts. Treated water from these water bodies is being released into lakes in Kolar district.The biggest challenge BDA had to grapple with before taking up desilting was what to do with the silt. Things fell into place once the authority found the solution.“Silt has huge demand among farmers and brick kiln owners. Farmers can get it for free after showing their KISAN/Aadhaar card and use it as manure,” a senior BDA official said. Silt is a major raw material for brick kilns and they need to submit letters detailing their requirements to the authority, which will approve them, he added.Tenders for desilting were floated last week and work is expected to start next month. A senior BDA official said desilting is the only way to save the lakes, which have been contaminated by sewage for many decades. “For now, sewage inflow has been stopped and diverted. BWSSB has assured us no sewage will be let into the lakes,” he added.A bathymetric (study of water depth) survey by Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and Madras Engineering Group and Centre in 2017 put the worth of silt in Bellandur and Varthur lakes at Rs 1,800 crore. While 6.6 million cubic metres of sediment on Bellandur lake bed has reduced its water-holding capacity to 5.5 MCM, 1.6 million cubic metres of silt has shrunk Varthur lake ’s holding capacity to 0.6 MCM. BDA has estimated that about 85 lakh cubic metres of silt will have to be removed from the water bodies. Once the lakes are desilted, bunds will be built and walkways developed. Only treated water will be let in, the official added.Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike commissioner BH Anil Kumar told TOI that giving away silt is better than transporting it. “Silt was earlier used to create artificial islands, something we can’t do now due to court orders. Transporting it to landfills is another option but it’s not viable,” Kumar said, adding: “Heavy trucks are required to transport silt, which will end up damaging roads.”",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73131024,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-841497,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bellandur-varthur-lake-silt-to-go-to-farmers-brick-kilns/articleshow/73129090.cms

Razia Begum (Left) and Lingaraju.

BENGALURU: The murder of a 51-year-old provision store owner, who was attacked with acid and set afire near Anekal on Friday night, has been cracked with two men and a woman being arrested. The shopkeeper had lent money to the woman and had allegedly demanded sexual favours from her in return.

Jyothappa M of Hennagara Hosahalli village was attacked by two unidentified men near his village when he was riding back from Hebbagodi on Friday night. The arrested are Razia Begum, 29, and Lingaraju, 40, of Sriramapura near Jigani and their associate Sathish, 26, a resident of Jigani.

After being attacked with acid, Jyothappa was hacked to death with a machete and his body was burnt. The incident had sent shockwaves in the area. Jyothappa succumbed to burns in hospital on Saturday morning.

Suryanagara police formed a team headed by DSP (Anekal sub-division) Nanjunde Gowda to nab the accused. “Before his death, Jyothappa had said he had lent Rs 30,000 to Razia and suspected her involvement in the attack. Based on his statement, Razia was picked up and she confessed to the crime,” a police officer said.

Preliminary probe revealed Razia and Lingaraju, from Ballari, had setted down in Sriramapura. Razia had complained to her neighbour Lingaraju, a painter, that she had borrowed Rs 30,000 from Jyothappa and he had been demanding sexual favours from her. The duo planned to eliminate Jyothappa and sought Sathish’s help to execute the murder plan.

Police said Lingaraju also sustained burn injuries as he dropped some acid on his hand while throwing it on Jyothappa. The duo also set Jyothappa’s bike on fire before escaping.

“We have seized the murder weapons from them,” an officer said, adding they’ve been produced before court, which has remanded them in judicial custody.

In a dire state

HYDERABAD: Expressing concern over the increasing levels of pollution in the state and particularly in Hyderabad, the Telangana high court on Monday decided to hear together all cases of pollution pending with it.

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy issued notices to the state and the pollution control board asking them to file their replies to a petition that charged them with “negligence while industrial pollution playing havoc with the lives of people” at Jeedimetla in the outskirts of the city.

The bench took up the case on its own after converting a news item in a vernacular daily that narrated the deplorable conditions prevailing at Jeedimetla area due to the alleged reckless and selfish attitude of the industrial polluters in the area who are turning the area into an uninhabitable one.

“Give us a list of cases filed against pollution control board and we will club them all,” the bench said addressing the board’s counsel. “The board should tell us how many PILs are pending against various kinds of pollution. There is a need to club and hear them. People are entitled to have clean air and water,” the bench added. The news item that moved the bench spoke about conditions prevailing at Jeedimetla, which falls under the GHMC.

Eluru: Superintendent of Eluru Government Hospital, Dr. AVR Mohan, was on Monday suspended after patients complained that he failed to crack the whip on staffers for dereliction of duty.

Vydya Vidhana Parishad commissioner Dr U Ramakrishna issued orders appointing in Mohan’s place senior ophthalmologist Dr AS Ram as incharge superintendent after health minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas asked him to bring erring authorities to book.

Complainants TOI spoke to said several of the government hospital’s staff partied from 11 am to 3 pm earlier this month, ringing in the new year and “felicitating the superintendent”. “Nursing college students, hospital medical officers, staff and workers danced for hours to popular film songs completely ignoring patients and leaving them to their fate,” a patient said. The furious patients and bystanders accused Dr Mohan of doing little to control the revelry or asking the staffers to resume duty.

The issue was brought to the notice of medical and health minister and deputy chief minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas by the attendants of a few patients admitted in the hospital.

The minister then directed the commissioner of AP Vydya Vidhana Parishad to take immediate action against the superintendent if guilty. After conducting inquiry into the matter, the authorities relieved Dr Mohan form duty temporarily.

The patients said the staffers were gone for hours and they were left in the lurch, causing grave inconvenience to most and putting the lives of a few others in danger.

Coimbatore: A couple from Karamadai approached collector K Rajamani seeking reopening of the investigation into their son’s death that happened a month ago. The couple said the death, which was registered as a road accident , could be a case of caste-related murder.

Selvam and Chandiramani said their 22-year-old son Arun kumar was last seen riding a two-wheeler with two boys from another caste. “He was last seen riding with the boys around 5.20pm on December 8. However, at 6.30pm, I got a call from one of the boys stating that my son had got injured and was lying unconscious,” said Chandiramani.

“But by the time we reached, my son had been sent to GH by some villagers. The postmortem said my son died due to a head injury. We didn’t suspect any foul play at first,” she said.

However, the family became suspicious after realizing that the other two boys suffered no injuries and the two-wheeler was in a good condition.

Social activist Dhandapani said that the police personnel, who investigated the case, had failed to check the footage from the CCTV camera installed in a nearby bank. “The boys’ parents and the victim’s father had a caste clash in 2017. The boys belong to OC (other caste) and Arun Kumar was a scheduled caste boy. So, Arun Kumar riding with the boys itself seems suspicious.”

The Karamadai police had registered a case of death due to road accident after the vehicle was found hit by an unidentified vehicle.

Amritsar: Two days after attack on Nankana Sahib gurdwara, Sikh man Parvinder Singh was killed in Peshawar, but his elder brother Harmeet Singh has not lost all hope. Though he accepts that such cases related to minorities are suppressed, he believes assassins of his brother will soon be thrown behind bars.

He also feels that despite a general sense of fear among Pakistani Sikhs , there are not many chances of minorities’ exodus.

While talking to TOI over phone from his village Chakesar in Shangla district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province of Pakistan on Monday, Harmeet said, “Police are narrowing down on the killers of my brother, but I wonder why he was targeted.”

Harmeet, Pakistan’s first Islamabad-based Sikh TV anchor, said, “I am from your community. I come across people of all faith, including Hindu, Sikhs, Muslim, and even those who are forcibly converted. However, following killing of my brother, I didn’t see fear in the community, not even in my family.”

He said if he or his family would have been scared, he would have not been sitting in his hilly home town.

“At present, it is snowing in this remote hill town and I am with my family and friends,” he said.

On Sunday, two days after attack on Nankana Sahib gurdwara, Harmeet’s younger brother, Parvinder Singh, who was settled in Malaysia, was shot dead in Chamkani area of Peshawar. He was there for his wedding shopping.

Asked whether there was any possibility of exodus of Hindus and Sikhs to India out of fear, Harmeet replied, “I don’t think so, a few people had been exaggerating the issue. Police are working on the case. We are also part of this society and government and ministers are in touch with me.”

However, he added, it was the media upon which he had maximum confidence to mount pressure on the government to bring culprits to the book. “After all, we are a minority here. Most such cases of minority community are suppressed, unless they are voiced through media,” he said.

He also denied that there could be any connection of his brother’s killing with attack on gurdwara Nankana Sahib.

“Police claims to have cracked 70% of the case, but they are yet to catch hold of the culprits. Let police arrest them, only then truth will be known,” he said.

RK Roja

Infighting within YSR Congress (YSRC) took an ugly turn after followers of YSRC ’s Nagari legislator RK Roja lodged a complaint against a rival faction in Chittoor district .

The spat between the two groups at Nagari assembly constituency almost grew into a clash when RK Roja was returning from a foundation stone-laying ceremony in KBR Puram under Puttur mandal on Sunday.

A group of over 30 YSRC activists obstructed the legislator’s vehicle and raised slogans against her for her support to local party functionaries who shifted to YSRC from Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ). The activists questioned Roja for not extending similar support to party workers who have been with YSRC since its inception.

Sources in YSRC said Roja had sidelined local party functionary DK Yelumalai after the party came to power in the state. Yelumalai’s followers alleged that the actress-turned-politician was instead supporting a group of local YSRC activists who had shifted from TDP.

It is also alleged that Roja overlooked Yelumalai’s suggestion for the location of the village secretariat and instead chose another location near KBR Puram village proposed by a rival group.

Following the blockade, Roja’s followers lodged a complaint against party functionaries involved in the incident. Cases have been registered against 37 YSRC activists under sections 143, 341 and 427 of the IPC.

CHANDIGARH: Despite a strict criterion for appointment as law officers in the Haryana advocate general (AG) office, the authorities have received around 1,700 applications for the 90 advertised posts. It means around 18 advocates would be competing for one post.

Sources confirmed to TOI that the authorities may not take interviews of applicants because of such a high number of applications and the final list may be released by the end of January on the basis of scrutiny of advocates’ professional record.

“We have received around 1,700 applications and considering such a high number of applications, it may not be possible to interview each and every candidate. The merit list would be prepared on the basis of profile and professional record of a candidate provided in the application form. We have started the process to scrutinise applications and expected to finalise the final list by the end of January,” Haryana advocate general Baldev Raj Mahajan told TOI.

Mahajan said that besides advocate general, home secretary and legal remembrancer (LR) of the state are members of the selection committee. He added that some more experts from the field of law may be involved in the selection process, if required. AG also accepted that despite a strict criteria for selection of law officers, the number of applications received by his office are significantly high.

Recently, the AG office Haryana had issued advertisement inviting applications for 90 posts of law officers. According to the criterion, an advocate having professional income of Rs 12 lakh for additional AG, Rs 8 lakh for deputy AG and Rs 5 lakh for assistant AG, would only be eligible to apply for the post.

For the first time, the Haryana AG office had issued advertisement for appointment of law officers in the AG office. As per the new criterion, those lawyers conducting practice before the district court are not eligible to apply this time.

Similarly, experience of practice as an advocate has also been fixed as 12, 8 and 5 years and should have conducted at least 55, 35 and 25 cases to become eligible for appointment on the post of additional, deputy and assistant AG, respectively. The cases should have been conducted only in the high court or before the Supreme court.

However, the criterion has also been challenged before the Punjab and Haryana high court for being arbitrary and the matter is present pending before the court for hearing.

These law officers are temporarily engaged by the state government for a particular period and reprsents the state government before various judicial platforms. As per the convention, people having affliation with the rulling party of the state are mainly engaged on such posts.

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Describing the assembly election as a referendum on the performance of AAP government, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday appealed to people to put their political preferences behind and vote in favour of progress and development. He said AAP would run a positive election campaign because “we do not know the politics of mudslinging”, adding that the party was open to suggestions from the opposition to add to its manifesto.

At the party headquarters, Kejriwal said AAP was ready for the election. “People have decided to vote on the basis of the improvement in infrastructure of government schools and hospitals. We count these as positive votes, which will be in our favour,” he said.

Kejriwal exuded confidence that AAP would outdo its performance in the previous assembly polls in 2015 where it bagged 67 out of 70 seats. The party currently has 61 MLAs and speculation is rife that at least a dozen of them may not get tickets again.

The CM said the people of Delhi had entrusted BJP with the responsibility of administering police, municipal corporations and DDA, and AAP with handling education, health, PWD, DJB and several other departments. “In the polls, people will compare the work done by BJP and AAP in their respective fields... People are happy with the progress made in the terms of education, health, power, water, etc,” he claimed.

He said people should not vote for AAP if they felt that the government had not performed. “I want you to vote for us only if you believe that we have worked for you. We are worthy of your votes if you believe we have done something for you. It takes a lot of strength to say something like this to your voters just before the election.”

Kejriwal said AAP functionaries would seek votes from the supporters of BJP and Congress for development. The CM claimed that if AAP didn’t return to office, schools and hospitals would relapse to their old condition.

He also slammed BJP’s Amit Shah for making personal attacks against him, but added that “we will never reply in the same manner” . “The progress of Delhi is running at a speed of 100km/hour. People will accelerate it to 200km/hour on February 8,” Kejriwal said.

The water birds were removed from Sukhna Lake in 2014 after the culling drive owing to avian flu

CHANDIGARH: A city-based environmentalist has written to the ministry of fisheries and animal husbandry to order the authorities in the city to bring ducks and geese back to Sukhna Lake .

The water birds were removed in 2014 after the culling drive owing to avian flu.

Rahul Mahajan, in his letter, said his NGO is willing to take care of the birds. The letter, “Birds at Sukhna Lake/cows in gaushala, Sector 45” has been sent to Giriraj Singh, minister of fisheries and animal husbandry and dairying.

The letter reads, “It is a humble request that we want ducks/geese back at Sukhna Lake, which were removed from the lake in December 2014 due to culling by the department of animal husbandry and fisheries, UT.” “We request you to kindly ask the concerned department to provide the birds again at the lake.”

Talking to TOI, he said, “Sukhna Lake was famous for the ducks and geese. The citizens of Chandigarh have sentiments attached with these birds. This is why I wrote to cabinet minister to allow them at Sukhna.”

He said their NGO had earlier as well been taking care of the ducks at Sukhna. “Disease is always possible but that does not mean to finish their habitat. The disease can be from migratory birds but the domestic should be allowed,” he said.

In the letter, he has also requested the minister to allow a gaushala in Sector 45 by using the vacant land managed by forest department, UT. He said the land could be given to gaushala only for temporary basis.

In 2014, a report from Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases had confirmed that H5N1 avian flu virus was present in one of the domestic birds which had died at the lake. Following directions from the Union ministry of agriculture, action was taken and around 250 ducks were culled.

PILIBHIT: Home guards in Pilibhit district , who play a pivotal role in assisting police in maintaining law and order, haven’t been paid since August last year. Their total arrears have gone up to over Rs 2.50 crore. The backlog is persisting despite the superintendent of police sending a number of reminders to state police administration without effect.

According to SP Abhishek Dixit, district police administration has engaged 200 home guards as supplementary force to carry out policing duty to ensure safety, security and peace at certain occasions like festivals, national holidays, elections for assembly and parliament, etc.

“Each home guard is paid Rs 702 a day. As their payment is pending since August 1, 2019, their total arrears have accumulated to Rs 2,56,95,500. The department had been allocated Rs 10.62 crore to meet the payment of home guards in March 2019, with which their arrears up to July 31 were cleared,” he said.

“The requisite funds for home guards have been regularly released every quarter by state police administration in the past, but despite three reminders between August 20, 2019 and January 2, 2020, it has been delayed this time,” he added.

The accounts section at district police headquarters informed that four other daily wagers deployed by the department have also not been paid wages since August 1. Their cumulative dues have now gone up to Rs 3 lakh.

The affected home guards, who preferred to remain anonymous, described how they were surviving without pay. They said those who were from rural areas and had agricultural lands were not starving as they had surplus produce, but around 40% of them who are from urban areas and were totally dependent on their salary for survival, were borrowing money from usurers at heavy interest rates to pay their children’s school fees and run their families.

Mumbai: As protests against the attacks at JNU gathered momentum, several film personalities joined in to show solidarity with the students, holding an impromptu meeting at Carter Road, Bandra, on Monday night.

The two-hour sit-in from 8pm to 10pm saw actors and directors, including Anurag Kashyap , Anubhav Sinha, Sudhir Mishra, Vishal Bharadwaj, Dia Mirza, Zoya Akhtar, Taapsee Pannu, Richa Chadha, Rahul Bose, Saurabh Shukla, Ali Fazal, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub, Swara Bhasker and stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra condemn Sunday’s violence . The group sang the poem ‘Hum Dekhenge’ by Faiz Ahmed Faiz.

Participants held posters and placards that read: “Modiji, Ilaaka yeh sabka, go back to your gully” and a pun on the word “religion” that read, “Our country is all about ‘jan’ (where the word “religion” was broken into two and “reli” crossed out).”

Many in the film industry , which had come under fire on Twitter for not taking a stand on the Citizenshhip Amendment Act, called Sunday’s violence at JNU “horrifying”, “heartbreaking” and “barbaric”. Anil Kapoor, Alia Bhatt , Rajkummar Rao, Twinkle Khanna, Sonam Kapoor Ahuja, Shabana Azmi and Richa Chadha spoke against the violence on Monday.

Others, including Deepika Padukone , Pooja Bhatt, Vishal Dadlani, Meghna Gulzar and Aanand Rai, expressed their views too.

Padukone told a news channel, “I am proud of them (the students). They are not afraid. The fact that they are expressing themselves, that they are thinking of the country and its future. Whatever be our point of view, it is important to express it if we wish to see change in our lives or in our country.”

Alia Bhatt said it is time to “strongly oppose any ideology that seeks to divide, oppress and promote violence”.

Kriti Sanon said violence was never the solution and what happened in the varsity was inhuman.

Rajkummar Rao called the attack “heartbreaking”.

Filmmaker Hansal Mehta urged celebrities to speak up.

Actor Renuka Shahane termed the attacks “unbelievable, shameful and scary”.

Earlier, Taapsee Pannu had tweeted, “Coz with great power comes greater responsibility and I don’t want to shy away from it. JNU, you have our love and support.”

Cop on duty in Bhatpara after a shooting in June last year

KOLKATA: The Calcutta High Court has directed the Bhatpara Municipality chairman to hold the meeting of the board of councillors at 1pm on Tuesday.

The court has also asked the North 24 Parganas DM to attend the meeting and file a report to the court on the outcome of the no-trust notice served on the municipality chairman on Thursday.

A division bench of Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Protik Prakash Banerjee brought forward the date of the meeting to January 7 when Bhatpara Municipality chairman Saurav Singh had issued a notice for the no-trust meeting on January 20.

The bench passed the order after senior lawyer and MP Kalyan Bandyopadhyay representing the appellant and Bhatpara councillor Himangshu Sarkar pointed out that BJP moved court after the board of councillors in presence of 19 Trinamool councillors out of total 33 had adopted a resolution to remove the present chairman. “A writ petition was filed, challenging the notice served by three Trinamool councillors. It didn’t pray for setting aside the resolution,” Bandyopadhyay said. Calling the single-bench order setting aside the entire proceedings of the board meeting “illegal”, the senior lawyer urged the court to set aside the single-bench order.

The division bench didn’t make any observation on the single-bench order. It instead directed the municipality chairman to hold the meeting on Tuesday. Chairman’s lawyer Saptangsu Basu urged for at least a day’s time on grounds that the chairman might not be in town on Tuesday. The bench, however, directed both the chairman and DM to issue notice for the meeting on Tuesday.

TMC councillors served a no-trust notice on Saurav Singh on December 6, after regaining a majority in the municipality. The chairman acknowledged the notice and issued a circular on December 21 fixing the board meeting on January 20. Calling it “illegal”, three Trinamool councillors served another notice, fixing the meeting date on January 2. They argued that the chairman should have called the meeting within a fortnight. Ninteen TMC councillors turned up for the meeting on Thursday and passed the no-trust resolution against the chairman. BJP councillors didn’t turn up.

366,['7/01/2020'],Bareilly: Owners of 15-year-old vehicles get January 31 deadline for renewal of RCs,"This story is from January 7, 2020

BAREILLY: The Bareilly Regional Transport Office (RTO) has given a final opportunity to the owners who have vehicles older than 15 years to get their registration certificates renewed by January 31. Failing which, said officials, their vehicles will be impounded.

RTO officials said once the deadline got over, they would launch a drive during which such vehicles would be checked for RCs and the vehicles plying without renewed RCs would be impounded.

According to RTO record, till August 2018, around 58,000 vehicles were found to be more than 15-year-old; of these, only around 4,000 owners got their RCs renewed.

Speaking to TOI, Bareilly senior assistant regional transport officer (ARTO) RP Singh said, “Nearly, 60,000 vehicles, including two-wheelers and four-wheelers (up to seven seats), were identified to be more than 15-year-old. The owners had been served notices six times in the past year, but only around 4,000 of them got the RCs renewed. Others are, however, operating their vehicles even after the expiration of RCs. Now, as a final reminder, we ask them to get their RCs renewed on or before January 31. Failing which may result in permanent cancellation of RCs. If such vehicles are found operating without renewed RCs, in violation of the Motor Vehicles Act, the transport authority will impound them.”

Moreover, according to RTO officials, the department has exempted vehicle owners from paying a penalty for the delay, and they now only require paying the RC renewal fee. The renewed RCs will be valid for five years.

“Earlier, there was a penalty of Rs 500 on four-wheelers and Rs 300 on two-wheelers for the delay in getting the RCs renewed. But, now, the owners have to pay only a renewal fee of Rs 600 for four-wheelers and Rs 300 for two-wheelers, along with a Green Tax of 10%,” added the ARTO.

RTO officials said a fresh report would be compiled in March to update the list of 15-year-old vehicles and the owners of the newly-added vehicles would get a deadline for getting their RCs renewed.

Nusli Wadia (File photo)

NEW DELHI: A last-minute threat from businessman Nusli Wadia 's counsel on Monday to pursue a civil defamation case against Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata put paid to the efforts of the Supreme Court for an amicable settlement of criminal defamation proceedings initiated by Wadia against Tata.

Wadia had initiated the proceedings against Tata and other directors of Tata Group companies after he was ousted as director from Tata Steel, Tata Chemicals and Tata Motors following his support to Cyrus Mistry , who was voted out as executive chairman of Tata Sons in 2016.

The criminal defamation proceedings were quashed by the Bombay high court, which had recorded that there was no intention to defame Wadia through the resolution circulated among the boards. However, Wadia's counsel CA Sundaram told a bench of CJI S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant that it was a clear case of defamation and the matter should be taken to trial.

Sundaram said Wadia had no grievance against his ouster as director of Tata Group companies. ""What has hurt and defamed him was the resolution circulated among board members. I am against the persons who requisitioned the meeting by making false and defamatory statements,"" he said.

CJI Bobde said Tata and Wadia were respected industry leaders and it did not behove them to fight like this. ""We are not on the merits of the case. You people should not pursue litigation like this. If both of you want, we can appoint a reputed mediator.

Or why can't both of you sit down and talk it out?"" the CJI asked. Sundaram said if the allegations made in the resolutions were withdrawn, Wadia would cease the case. Appearing for Tata, A M Singhvi said, ""It was Wadia who admitted that he had circulated a copy of the resolution and now he accuses others of defaming him.""

Along with Mukul Rohatgi, Singhvi said Tata was ready to say that he had no intention to defame Wadia, as was found by the HC. When the bench was a bout to record Singhvi's statement on behalf of Tata and dispose of the criminal defamation litigation, it heard one of the counsels for Wadia saying this would not preclude him from initiating civil defamation proceedings for damages. This got the court's goat and the CJI said, ""This is not fair"". It decided to adjourn hearing in Wadia's appeal for a week and asked Sundaram to get instructions from his client about full settlement.

The house in New Alipore where the body was found

KOLKATA: The heavily decomposed body of a 26-year-old woman, a BCom (Honours) graduate found in the Sahapur Colony area in New Alipore on Monday initially led cops to wonder if she might have been a victim of homicide. Autopsy sergeants hinted she could have died on December 23.

Victim Guddan alias Kavya Dhannani’s death was reported when her mother Neelam, 51, called her relative from a hospital on Monday to inform them that Kavya had committed suicide .

“The mother’s revelation came under a dramatic situation. Neelam claimed she had locked up her house on December 29 and was on her way to Bihar’s Katihar — her ancestral residence — when she lost consciousness at Howrah station. She was taken to the Howrah General Hospital by the GRP. Around 4pm on Monday, Neelam called up her brother-in-law and told him about Kavya. He, in turn, informed New Alipore police. When we went to the house, we found the heavily decomposed body on the bed. We didn’t find any external injuries on it,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.

Cops said they have also recovered a purported suicide note that said that both women were going to commit suicide. The police, though, believe the handwriting to be Neelam’s. Cops have also found a noose hanging from the ceiling.

“They might have tried to commit suicide together, but Neelam survived or developed cold feet. A detailed post-mortem will give us the time and cause of death. We will question Neelam once she recovers,” said an officer.

The cops said they have recorded statements from neighbours who said they picked up a foul smell during a New year’s Eve party but had thought it was from a dead animal.

Bihar-based parties like Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal (United) and Lok Janshakti Party, apart from Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party , National Lok Dal and several other political parties are eyeing the vote share in the capital to make their presence felt.

They have thin support, but are high on confidence. BSP Delhi in-charge ML Tomar said that the party will not only contest the 70 assembly seats but also win them. “In 2008, the party had won Gokalpur and Badarpur assembly constituencies. We also have three councillors here,” added Tomar. BSP will contest the election on the issue of water quality, inflation and unemployment.

RJD and JD(U) are seeking an opportunity to capitalise on the growing influence of Poorvanchali voters in Delhi. “We will contest a limited number of seats where people want RJD to represent them,” said RJD’s Delhi in-charge Manoj Jha adding that RJD will pitch the election on the issue of CAA-NRC, unemployment, disempowerment of Poorvanchalis, lack of quality higher education, etc. In past, Delhi had one RJD MLA.

JD(U) is likely to contest around 20 assembly seats. “We have provided tap water to 50% people of Bihar and by the end of this year all of Bihar will get piped drinking water. But in Delhi not all get piped water. The AAP government has not done anything to improve water quality,” said Sanjay Kumar Jha, JD(U) Delhi in-charge. JD(U) will focus on local issues like infrastructure, water quality, etc. It has represented Matia Mahal assembly constituency in past.

LJP’s supremo Ram Vilas Paswan had recently locked horns with CM Arvind Kejriwal on the issue of water quality. The party is preparing to contest the polls, but not yet decided on the number of seats.

All these parties are expected to finalise their list of candidates by the end of the week.

Best of arrangements

TIRUPATI: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ( TTD ) won accolades from VIPs and common devotees alike for making the best of arrangements for the annual Vaikunta Ekadasi festival, which was conducted on a grand scale on Monday.

Proceedings at the Tirumala temple began as early as 12.30 am when priests performed Dhanurmasam rituals and opened the ‘Uttara dwaram’ — also referred to as ‘Vaikunta dwaram’ — located adjacent to the sanctum sanctorum. Union and state ministers, around 15 judges, elected representatives, bureaucrats and several top officials offered prayers to Lord Venkateswara between 1.15 am and 3.45 am.

TTD sources said over 3,800 VIP passes were issued for Vaikunta Ekadasi this year. Though the temple administration had earlier declared that the VIP darshan slot would be from 2 am to 5 am, TTD advanced the slot from 1.15 am to 3.45 am to advance the darshan timings for common devotees who were awaiting their turn in large numbers in the outside queue lines.

Darshan for common devotees began sharp at 3.45 am and went on uninterrupted. TTD allowed 2,500 devotees, who donated to the Srivani trust, for darshan at around 10 am on Monday. Around 90,000 devotees offered prayers to Lord Venkateswara and had the opportunity to tread through the ‘Vaikunta dwaram’, considered to relieve those passing through it from the cycle of rebirth.

Spiritual dioramas set up by the garden wing of the TTD stood out as a special attraction. TTD spent Rs 25 lakh to design the concepts of Dasavatara Vaibhavam and Asta Lakshmi, set up near the Vaibhavotsava mandapam.

Among those who visited the temple were Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy, state ministers Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy and Vellampalle Srinivas, Telangana ministers KT Rama Rao and T Harish Rao and elected representatives from AP and Telangana.

373,['7/01/2020'],Anil Deshmukh vows check on crime in big cities,"This story is from January 7, 2020

PUNE: State home minister Anil Deshmukh on Monday said his priority would be to keep a check on crime in big cities, including Nagpur “which is now considered a city of crimes”.

“I am planning to take charge of the home department on January 8. I will meet the top authorities in the department and decide my action plan following the discussions with them,” the newly appointed minister said.

“My top priority will be to keep a check on crime in all major cities. It is unfortunate that Nagpur is now considered a city of crimes though the former chief minister was from that city and was in charge of the home department for the past five years,” Deshmukh said.

Considered close to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Deshmukh said he took charge of the home ministry because he liked to accept challenges.

On his stand about Pawar’s recent demand to conduct an independent probe into the police action against human rights activists in the Elgar Parishad case, Deshmukh said he would meet the NCP chief and Pune police officers concerned to understand their views on the issue.

Pawar had sought the formation of a special investigation team to conduct an “independent inquiry” into the cases filed against human rights activists in connection with the Elgar Parishad case. He had asserted that prima facie it looked like the Pune police had misused its authority while probing the case.

Deshmukh said he had plans to hold a meeting of the Pune and Pimpri and Chinchwad police to review law and order in the city.

MLA raises incomplete police station issue

Wadgaonsheri MLA Sunil Tingre on Monday submitted a letter to home minister Anil Deshmukh about the incomplete police station work near Inorbit Mall on Ahmednagar Road. Tingre said, “The foundation laying ceremony was done about four years ago. But there has been no progress on the construction of the police station.

374,['7/01/2020'],Nobel laureate bats for mechanism design theory,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Pune: Nobel laureate Eric Maskin urged the graduating students of Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics to study mechanism design theory.

Maskin — who was awarded the Nobel Prize for economics in 2007 — was delivering the Kale Memorial Lecture on the occasion of the institute’s convocation on Monday. As many as 158 graduates and scholars were awarded degrees.

Maskin said less than 10% of the world’s economists focus on this discipline, which is the art of starting with the outcome and then figuring out the institutions or concepts to build in order to get there.

To drive home his point, Maskin spoke about the ‘first past the post’ electoral method in which, sometimes, parties that win as few as a third of the total votes polled get to form governments. He said this can be solved by the application of mechanism design, and said he was working with other global economists, including fellow Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, to find a solution.

“Many countries — India included — have adopted this system and oftentimes, parties or candidates with only 30-40% of the votes end up in power. We are working on alternative voting systems and I am sure mechanism design will play a role,” Maskin said.

The decorated economist also said mechanism design can be used to in devise policies to prevent a 2008-like global financial crisis, when the banks overleveraged, or in designing an international treaty to get countries commit to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. “Regulators can play an important role in preventing banks from overleveraging, and mechanism design as a concept can help them devise strategies,” Maskin said.

He said the concept can also be used to discover the right value of and allocation of prized resources, such as radio frequencies. He said, however, that the theory will have to be used with caution as there is a chance that the participants could overstate or understate the value put on a resource.

PUNE: The Chatushrungi police on Sunday booked four men, all from Baner-Balewadi areas, for kidnapping and issuing threats to a hypnotist from Pimple Saudagar on Friday afternoon over a financial dispute.

The hypnotist (age 37 years) lodged a FIR with the Chatushrungi police station stating that he had borrowed Rs30 lakhs from one of the men in 2017. Out of the total amount of Rs30 lakhs, the victim returned Rs10 lakhs. At the same time, he also returned about Rs16 lakhs by paying monthly instalments to the suspects.

In 2019, according to the complaint, the business of the hypnotist was in loss and he failed to pay the monthly instalment.

Pilibhit: Home guards in Pilibhit district, who play a pivotal role in assisting police in maintaining law and order, haven’t been paid since August last year. Their total arrears have gone up to over Rs 2.50 crore. The backlog is persisting despite the superintendent of police sending a number of reminders to state police administration without effect.

According to SP Abhishek Dixit, district police administration has engaged 200 home guards as supplementary force to carry out policing duty to ensure safety, security and peace at certain occasions like festivals, national holidays, elections for assembly and parliament, etc.

“Each home guard is paid Rs 702 a day. As their payment is pending since August 1, 2019, their total arrears have accumulated to Rs 2,56,95,500. The department had been allocated Rs 10.62 crore to meet the payment of home guards in March 2019, with which their arrears up to July 31 were cleared,” he said.

“The requisite funds for home guards have been regularly released every quarter by state police administration in the past, but despite three reminders between August 20, 2019 and January 2, 2020, it has been delayed this time,” he added.

The accounts section at district police headquarters informed that four other daily wagers deployed by the department have also not been paid wages since August 1. Their cumulative dues have now gone up to Rs 3 lakh.

The affected home guards, who preferred to remain anonymous, described how they were surviving without pay. They said those who were from rural areas and had agricultural lands were not starving as they had surplus produce, but around 40% of them who are from urban areas and were totally dependent on their salary for survival, were borrowing money from usurers at heavy interest rates to pay their children’s school fees and run their families.

PUNE: A man posing as a Mathadi worker was arrested on Sunday for attempting to extort Rs40,000 from an employee of a private company at Senapati Bapat Road.

Vicky Dilip Dhotre (26) of Wadarwad was arrested after the 30-year-old employee lodged an FIR at the Chatushrungi police on Saturday.

The incident occurred on Saturday evening when the employee was shifting the furniture and computers of a software company from Hadapsar to Senapati Bapat Road. He said soon after his loaded truck reached the software company’s new office, Dhotre stopped him at the gate. “He demanded Rs40,000 from the employee to allow him to unload the material,” assistant inspector of Chatushrungi police Dattatray Shinde said.

Shinde said that Dhotre asked the employee to transfer the money to his cousin’s bank account as Mathadi fees. “The employee asked an aggravated Dhotre to unload the truck first, following which he would transfer the amount. The suspect, however, refused to render his services and kept threatening the private company employee,” the assistant inspector said. When Dhotre refused to back-off, the company employee noted down his cellphone number and reported the extortion bid to the police.

“After tracing the miscreant, we asked him for his identity card and licence to check if he was authorized to do the job of Mathadi, but he failed to furnish the details. Further probe revealed that he was only posing as Mathadi worker,” he said.

MUMBAI: In a significant order, a sessions court has held a 36-year-old Vidyavihar man guilty of abetting his 26-year-old girlfriend ’s 2012 suicide after he went back on his promise to marry her and instead married another woman. The accused, Avinash Gaikwad, was in a relationship with the woman for over six years, had lived in with her intermittently and also forced her to have an abortion. Sentencing Gaikwad to five years’ rigorous imprisonment, the court said punishment should act as a deterrent.

“A tendency is growing in society of giving a promise to marry, having a sexual relation with a lady and thereafter refusing to marry. So, it destroys the character and career of the lady. In the present case, the deceased was an educated lady who kept faith in the accused. The accused used her but he refused to marry her and married another girl. She was shocked and committed suicide,” said the court.

The victim, a teacher with a master’s degree, attempted suicide on July 8, 2012, near a temple in Vidyavihar station by consuming pesticide. She called her cousin soon after. When her cousin arrived and found her in a semi-conscious state, she was rushed to a hospital. The victim told her she had consumed pesticide and had written a note which was in her bag. She died four days later.

The prosecution examined eight witnesses, including her brother, relatives, the manager of a hotel where the victim and the accused had stayed together, doctor who conducted the post- mortem and the police. The victim’s father, the complainant, died in the period the case was pending in court.

The prosecution submitted the victim and the accused lived in the same building and hence got to know each other. The victim used to live in the city with her aunt while her parents lived in the village. The prosecution also submitted the accused had always promised to marry the victim and hence she agreed to get sexually involved with him.

The victim’s brother told the court the accused had even met their father and promised to marry her. He said though the brother of the accused was against the marriage, he assured them of it. The prosecution also produced a suicide note and said it clearly showed the victim committed suicide as she was deeply in love with the accused who had cheated her by marrying another woman.

It said a handwriting expert had concluded the note was written by the victim.

NEW DELHI: In the capital’s triangular poll battle , it’s Congress that probably faces the toughest of the challenges . After being in office for three consecutive terms — from 1998 to 2013 — the party was pushed to the brink in the 2013 assembly polls, managing only eight seats in the 70-member assembly. The worst, however, came a year later when AAP, in just its second election, won a record 67 seats. Congress couldn’t even open its account.

Virtually unassailable at one point in time, Congress has faced a string of debacles, including the Lok Sabha elections of 2014 and 2019, and the 2017 municipal polls after that. However, not only did the party’s vote share improve considerably in the last Lok Sabha election, it also managed to secure the second position in five of the seven seats, pushing AAP to the third spot.

Buoyed by the recent successes in Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand, the state unit of Congress feels it stands a good chance this time around in Delhi. “We have been in government for 15 years and we have the vision and the capacity toserve. Development has stagnated in the capital in the last six years and AAP could not even maintain the city that the Sheila Dikshit-led government left behind,” Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra said.

Former Gole Market (abolished after delimitation) MLA and campaign committee chairman Kirti Azad said: “We are prepared and will run an aggressive campaign, which will compare the work done by Congress under Dikshit and the current (Arvind) Kejriwal government,” Azad said.

Fragmented and divided into groups in the absence of a clear leadership after Dikshit’s death in July 2019, the Congress leadership in Delhi seems to be coming back together under Chopra. By giving him the reins of the party, appointing Azad as chairman of the campaign committee and giving charge of publicity to veteran functionary Jai Prakash Agarwal, Congress has also tried to bring Punjabi, Poorvanchali and Vaish communities together, as these dominate Delhi’s demography.

Together with Arvinder Singh Lovely as the election management committee head and Mukesh Sharma as the in charge of media, the party will be looking to bring back its old vote bank that had shifted to AAP.

Chopra said the Delhi unit was now united like never before and senior functionaries were willing to go in the field and work like ordinary party workers. But will it translate into votes? “It was Congress that privatised power distribution and ensured 24x7 supply in Delhi. Our government converted public transport to CNG and increased forest cover to over 21% to reduce pollution. We signed an agreement with Haryana government to get more water for Delhi, started metro, brought in new buses, constructed flyovers and hospitals and opened five universities and new schools. People have seen our work and trust us,” the Delhi Congress president said.

He added that party’s manifesto will have several new schemes for Delhi, including relief in electricity consumption up to 600 units, free power up to 200 units for small traders and monthly pension of Rs 5,000 for senior citizens and other deprived sections. “The monthly pension of Rs5,000 will give a lot of relief to families that have elderly parents. It will help them by medicines. The children will also be keen to keep their parents with them and look after them,” Chopra said.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan ’s crime rate increased by 31% last year compared to 2018, police statistics revealed, adding that cases of dacoity, theft, loot, rape, abduction and murder saw a substantial hike.Officials said the increase was largely due to more registration of cases due to awareness among the masses. They also claimed that in most cases charge-sheets had been submitted.DGP Bhupendra Singh said, “Although there has been a spike in crime rate, disposal of cases also increased simultaneously. The law and order situation was better than 2018 and even during the Lok Sabha elections, no cases of violence were reported along with the fact that repolling was not required. There are certain issues which still need to be worked on and we are focusing on those.”He said from 2017 to 2019, there was an increase of 32.58% in cases lodged under various IPC sections.Although there was a hike in crime rate, there was a massive dip in incidents of communal violence with only seven such cases being reported as compared to 313 the previous year. In 2019, disposal was done in 2,07,319 cases, which is 28% higher than 2018.Singh added that the Special Operations Group constituted a Serious Frauds Investigation Unit and Cyber Crime Unit while CID was also planning to launch a Heinous Crime Monitoring Unit.“There have been few areas like Alwar , Bhiwadi and Bharatpur where special attention was required and more police personnel have been deployed in critical areas. Our aim is to also create awareness among youth about law as they are at times are both victims and perpetrators,” added Singh.Outlining the road map for the year ahead, the DGP said the plan was to focus on curbing road accidents, check organised crime and crimes against women and children.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73131230,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-117127,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/31-rise-in-raj-crimes-last-year-spike-in-murder-dacoity-cases/articleshow/73129871.cms

BAREILLY: BJP’s UP chief Swatantra Dev Singh has alleged that Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi was “funding” violence in Uttar Pradesh. He alleged that she was “bringing goons” from other states to foment trouble in the state.

“There was peace in UP for the last three years and I want to ask why Priyanka wants to cause riots here? Why doesn’t she do it in MP and Rajasthan? She is funding violence and bringing goons from other states and making them pelt stones to disrupt peace,” the BJP leader alleged while addressing a public meeting in Bareilly on Sunday night.

Referring to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, he said, “Neither Nehru (Jawaharlal) nor Manmohan Singh could do this work while minorities in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh suffered. They were forced to live a miserable life. For the first time, a political leader took this revolutionary decision and ensured CAA act came into existence. CAA is meant for giving Indian nationality to refugees belonging to the minority community so that they can live a respectable life. They can get house under PM housing scheme and benefits under other government schemes. I want to make it clear that CAA is not meant for withdrawing the nationality of any Indian Muslim. But opposition is misleading the people and disrupting the peace in the state.”

He further said, “Even Dr Ram Manohar Lohia had said in the past that minorities in Pakistan faced a lot of difficulties and they should be given Indian citizenship. But Samajwadi Party won’t remember the words of their founder because their leaders want to do politics for family benefits only.”

388,['7/01/2020'],Experts analyze 2019 healthcare budget quota,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Pune: Primary healthcare continues to be weak in the country and instead of fixing it, the government is allocating more money towards tertiary healthcare (hospitals), said two healthcare experts at a presentation of the People’s Budget in the city on Friday.

Over the next few weeks, a series of presentations will be organized by a civil rights group to study the allocation in the Union Budget 2019 and the projected needs in key sectors, such as healthcare, education and employment, among others, which affect the lives of civilians.

The healthcare budget was analyzed by experts Anant Phadke and Abhijit More, who relied on successive budget allocations and global data to project the trend of allocations in the country.

“Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the government will be spending on tertiary healthcare and money will be routed to private hospitals (through insurance). The allocations don’t even meet the Niti Aayog’s projection for the scheme,” More said.

He said the Ayushman Bharat Yojana would be applicable only in hospitals with over 50 beds, thereby leaving out over 90% of the healthcare facilities in the country, which have less than 30 beds each.

Phadke said the government continued to treat different citizens on different footings. He said the government’s healthcare spends Rs8,500 per year on a Union government employee, Rs6,000 on a defence personnel, Rs3,150 on a Railways employee and only Rs1,700 on civilians.

“The fact is a majority (over 60%) of the spends on healthcare are on out-patient department services and medicines. Only about 3% of the people require hospitalization. So, priorities need to be re-adjusted,” he added.

389,['7/01/2020'],"Top forest official says give animals space, blames urbanisation for conflict","This story is from January 7, 2020

Pune: Man-animal conflict cannot be blamed on the animals as it is happening because humans are encroaching on their space, Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forests, said.

“During cases of conflict, everyone holds the animals responsible. Animals need the space to thrive. We are encroaching due to urbanisation and the conflict will not end,” he said.

Limaye was speaking at a conference on Monday on Human and Wildlife Conflict: Concerns and Resolution organised by Biospheres in association with the department of botany at Modern College of Arts, Science and Commerce. The conference was a part of the Kirloskar Vasundhara International Film Festival.

Sachin Punekar, an ecologist and founder of city-based Biospheres, said urbanisation had caused distress among animals. “There has been a 35% growth in human land-use pattern. This is leading to urbanisation distress as it is pushing the animals out of their habitats and they’re moving towards cities,” he said.

Ajay Deshmukh, senior veterinary officer at Manekdoh Leopard Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre in Junnar, said leopards are a highly adaptive species.

“Considering that there is a lot of sugar cane plantation in the area, leopards have learnt to adapt to the new setting. They have made these sugar cane fields their home and are raising their cubs among these fields,” Deshmukh explained.

Co-existence is up to the people, he said. “People feel the leopard population is growing, when in reality they're spreading out. So, we have to decide whether we are ready to co-exist with these big cats,” Deshmukh said.

Subhash Badve, senior forest officer and an expert in grassland and pasture development, said food was one of the reasons that animals came to human dominated spaces for. “There's nothing left to eat in the jungle. There are human settlements and encroachments in forestland,” he said.

The conflict will end if food is made available to wildlife. “Grassland development is something nobody cares about. These grasslands have to be maintained and protected so the woody growth will increase and thorny spaces will increase. A working plan has to be made to protect these grasslands and the wildlife,” Badve said.

Toxicologist Sadanand Raut spoke about minimising deaths caused by snake bites. Calling it Mission Zero Snake Bite, Raut’s programme aims at survival since most deaths occur before reaching the hospital, he said.

Jaipur: The city police on Monday arrested the neighbour of the 11-year-old boy who was found murdered on Saturday morning in Muhana police station area. The accused had lured the child with the promise to fly kites but instead tried to sodomise him. When the boy resisted, he was strangulated. The accused then slit the child’s throat and dumped the body under a haystack. Cops might arrest the accused’s mother as it appears that she knew about the murder.

Arpit Choudhary’s body was found hidden beneath haystack a day after he was reported missing. He had left his home around 7am on Friday to feed pigeons near his house. When he did not return, the family registered a missing person report.

The accused, identified as 27-year-old Rakesh Sharma, was arrested after cops questioned around 200 witnesses.

Yogesh Dadhich, DCP, Jaipur South told TOI, “There were three factors which led to Sharma’s arrest. We found that he and his mother had cleaned their entire house on Sunday morning which is a strange thing to do in winters. Then their beahviour was suspicious. FSL team also found victim’s hair at the accused’s house.”

The child had a fondness for flying kites and since the accused knew the victim, he used this as an excuse to lure Arpit to his house. Sharma then attempted to sodomise him but when the child started screaming, the accused first strangled him and then slit his throat. Cops found traces of cement on the victim’s clothes and a bag of cement was also found at Sharma’s house.

During the investigation, it was found that Sharma had previously also tried to molest other children. Initially cops had suspected a man who had killed his wife in 2015 and dumped her body at the same spot where Arpit’s body was found.

391,['7/01/2020'],No psychologist for mentally ill patients at Bareilly women’s shelter home since 2005,"This story is from January 7, 2020

BAREILLY: Allahabad high court has recently asked the UP government to submit a plan of action for improving security and other facilities at government shelter homes for women. But the reality is, most women’s shelter homes in the state have more inmates than their capacity.

The government shelter home in Bareilly has a capacity for 125 women, but currently houses 207 inmates. Of the 125 seats, 100 are reserved for mentally ill patients and 25 for others. However, the home has nearly 150 mentally ill women.

The shelter home has assigned posts of psychologists and craft teachers for mentally ill patients which are lying vacant for the past few years, with the post of psychologist lying vacant since 2005. Though doctors from mental and district hospitals visit the home, sources said psychologists are required regularly for counselling of inmates.

Chhaya Badhval, the assistant superintendent of the Bareilly home, said, “We have a crafts teacher for regular inmates, but the home doesn’t have one for mentally ill patients. There are mental illnesses patients who have recovered and need a teacher for vocational training. Also, around two women return to their families every month. Following treatment and counselling, mentally ill patients are able to recall their address and we contact their families. However, if we have a psychologist here, this number will go up.”

The high court also directed the government to install CCTV cameras in the shelter homes to enhance security. Officials said they have installed 12 CCTV cameras at the Bareilly home.

Shatrugan Kannaujia, district probation officer, Meerut, said, “We already have CCTV cameras installed at Nari Niketan in Meerut. Against the capacity of 75, we have 78 women living there. We also have vocational trainers, who train the women in the art of making handbags and other items, which can fetch them jobs later on. Psychologists, too, are available. Regarding instructions to install CCTV cameras, we’ll check the ones already installed to decide if more can be installed inside the premises.”

Nari Niketan in Mathura, with a capacity for 25 inmates, currently houses 35 inmates, including a child. Mathura DPO Anurag Srivastava claimed two psychologists, along with a woman physician, visit the home once a month. He said there are nine security personnel working three in each shift.

393,['7/01/2020'],"Why contempt proceedings shouldn’t be initiated against you, HC asks SSP Dehradun, Haridwar","This story is from January 7, 2020

Nainital: Uttarakhand high court ( HC ) on Monday ordered the senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Dehradun and Haridwar districts to be personally present in court and show cause why contempt of court proceeding should not be initiated against them in an ongoing matter related to SC/ST scholarship scam.

The court’s action came after the two SSPs failed to file an ‘Action Taken Report’ as directed by the court in its last hearing on December 16. “SIT head IPS officer Manjunath, who is probing the scam, had told court in the last hearing that they have filed FIRs against colleges in both Haridwar and Dehradun districts and that now it was up to the police of the two districts to take action. However, despite the court order, the police officers did not submit a report,” said MC Pant, the lawyer appearing for the petitioner.

The court further said that the SSPs not only failed to file the report but also didn’t file an application to seek extension. “Order of court necessitates prompt compliance... the casual manner in which the orders of the court are treated is a concern. Since the order has been violated, both the SSPs shall appear by Thursday and show cause as to why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against them in what appears to be a wilful and deliberate violation of the court,” the judges said.

The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has been hearing a clutch of petitions that had flagged embezzlement of funds in awarding scholarship to students from underprivileged backgrounds of scheduled caste and scheduled tribes. There are also allegations that the benefits of scholarship which was meant for students whose family income is less than Rs 2.5 lakh has been availed by senior government officials.

Meanwhile, the court also directed the secretary of the state’s social welfare department to take a decision on granting sanction for prosecuting the government officials of the social welfare department by February 10 and file a compliance report as well.

This comes after Manjunath informed the court that he had sought permission of the government to prosecute the five officials working in the department who have fraudulently availed the benefits of the scholarship scheme.

“The police said that they have filed an FIR naming the five officials. However when the permission was sought, the government gave the go-ahead against only one of the officials arguing that they are hearing the person whose names have been mentioned in the FIR,” Pant said.

The court however held that the Prevention of Corruption Act under which the FIR has been filed does not say that the government should hear the accused when the permission for prosecution is sought by police officials. “The court therefore said that such a delay is curious and the secretary should take a decision by the next date of hearing,” Pant said.

PUNE: A travel bag containing valuables collectively worth Rs17,210 of an outstation customer was stolen from the baggage room of Phoenix Market City on Ahmednagar road between 6.30pm and 8pm on December 30.

The customer could not register a complaint because he was in a hurry to board a flight. The mall security officer, Ganesh Kamble (35), lodged an FIR on his behalf with the Airport police on January 4 after receiving the list of the stolen articles.

Police said the customer had visited the mall for shopping and kept his bag in the luggage room on the ground floor. The burglar broke the lock of the luggage room door with a sharp object, stole the bag and fled. The theft came to light after the room in-charge found the lock broken. The mall authorities then tallied the number of luggage pieces kept in the room and found that a bag was stolen, the police said.

Senior inspector Gajanan Pawar from the Airport police said on Monday, “The burglar was seen walking fearlessly in the CCTV footage of the mall. We suspect that he had conducted a recce earlier. We are in the process of establishing his identity. We shall also question the ex-employees of the mall.”

A spokesperson from the mall said, “The luggage room is in the service area of the ground floor. It is a secured place under the surveillance of CCTV cameras and opened only for keeping and removing luggage. The cameras have captured images of the man (in mid-20s) breaking the lock, stealing the first bag from the rack and walking out. The man was sporting a cap. He was seen loitering in the mall. The bag contained a speaker, blue tooth, hard disc, clothes and hotel bills, among other articles.”

The spokesperson said, “The man walked into the mall from the south-facing Ahmednagar road side. He walked out through the north side on the High Capacity Mass Transit Route. We have tracked his movements up to Vimannagar Chowk. He may have fled in the direction of Kharadi or Wagholi. We suspect that the man was aware of the place or was an ex-employee.”

400,['7/01/2020'],Samant report may not be tabled,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Jaipur: Even as the Samant committee report was submitted to the state government in August last year, no decision has yet been taken on it as it is still under examination. Moreover, looking at the financial crunch, the government may not present it in the state assembly during the budget session, scheduled to be held in February, according to sources.

The committee was set up by the previous BJP government to examine and implement the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission and to iron out the pay anomalies in the salaries of the state government employees.

The state government employee unions (including ministerial, roadways, lab technicians and other employees) were hoping that the report will be in favour of them. The employee unions had demanded that the levels 5, 6, 7 (three levels created under 7th Pay Commission) must be merged under the grade pay 2,400 and levels 8 and 9 must be clubbed under the grade pay 2,800.

A finance department official had earlier said it was difficult to implement one of the main demands of the government employee unions, who wanted that under the grade pay 2,400 the pay levels 5, 6, 7 must be merged and the levels 8 and 9 to be clubbed under the grade pay 2,800.

""It is difficult to implement it (the merger of pay levels). The government took a conscious decision to create so many levels under the 7th pay commission, which was implemented in the recent past (in 2017). Why will it reconsider its decision in just less than two years? There is no reason to merge these levels,"" the official had said.

The committee had submitted the report with its recommendations for revising and fixing pay level, assessment of financial burden on the government and examine various allowances given to the employees.

The state government had set up a committee headed by a retired IAS officer D C Samant in 2017 to examine and implement the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission for state government employees. Two retired officers of Rajasthan account service D K Mittal and M P Dixit were the members of the committee.

401,['7/01/2020'],Sea of devotees streams through Paramapatha Vaasal,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Trichy: The most auspicious event of the 21-day Vaikunda Ekadasi festival of Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangam, the opening of Paramapatha Vaasal and the subsequent traversal of lord Namperumal, was celebrated with religious fervor in the early hours of Monday. Thousands of people were present inside and outside the temple complex to witness the auspicious happening as well as to pass through the Paramapatha Vaasal also known as Sorgavaasal (a gateway to heaven).

Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple, located between the Kollidam and the Cauvery, is revered as Boologa Vaikundam (heaven on earth) and is the foremost of all Divya Desam temples in Vaishnavite belief. Every year, during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December-January), Vaikunda Ekadasi is celebrated for about 21 days in the pattern of Pagal Pathu (daytime celebrations for 10 days) and Raa Pathu (night time celebrations for 10 days). On the final day of Pagal Paththu festivities, lord Namperumal appears in Mohini alangaaram for devotees followed by the beginning of Raa Paththu festivities that mark lord Namperumal being taken out in a procession from the sanctum sanctorum to exit through the Paramapatha Vaasal.

Meanwhile, as the first day of Raa Paththu that fell on Monday, Namperumal came out of his sanctum sanctorum by around 3.30 am. After passing through Rajamahendiran Thirusuttru, Naazhi Kettan gateway, Kulasekaran Suttru corridors all decked with thousands of devotees, lord Namperumal reached Vraja Nadhi Mandapam by around 4.30 am where special prayers were performed by senior priests.

As the clock struck 4.45 am, the Paramapatha Vaasal was opened after a period of one year. Subsequently, lord Namperumal wearing the gem-studded armour passed through the gateway amidst the Ranga Ranga and Govinda Govinda chants from a sea of devotees. “We believe that passing through the Paramapatha Vaasal would wash away the sins of our past. It was a divine experience to cherish,” C S Baskaran, a devotee from Salem said. After the holy exit through Sorgavaasal, Namperumal was worshipped by thousands of devotes near the Thousand pillar hall. Despite local holiday in Trichy district, the footfall compared to the past few years estimated between 1.5 lakh to 2 lakh on Monday was among the lowest in the recent years. Reopening of schools across Tamil Nadu after the half-yearly holiday and the auspicious event falling on a weekday were cited as the reasons for the dip in the footfall. Vaikunta Ekadasi festival that commenced with the conduct of Thirunedunthantakam ritual on December 26 is scheduled to conclude with the Nammalvar Motcham on January 16 at Srirangam.

ALWAR: A government hospital is functioning in Alwar without recognition of the state government since 2003.

In government records, it is just a ward of government-run Rajiv Gandhi Hospital but it is operational as Geetanand Child Hospital. The matter has come to light following deaths of children in Kota’s JK Lon Hospital hit the headlines.

According to government records, it is a 23-bed paediatric ward with 18 healthcare staff. But, in reality it has 73 beds with Facility-Based Newborn Care (FBNC) unit. The hospital has an emergency and outdoor unit. It is a full-fledge hospital functional without state government’s recognition.

For the past 16 years, the residents of the area have been demanding to convert the ward into a hospital in government records, but all efforts went in vain.

Geetanand Child Hospital principal medical officer Dr Sunil Chouhan has taken up the issue and wrote to Congress minister Tikaram Julie for granting it hospital recognition.

Julie has assured him of taking measures in this direction. He said in the past, steps were taken for government recognition for the hospital, but now efforts will be intensified for improving facilities in the hospital.

Nurisng association’s district head Pushpraj Sharma said it was wrong as per norms, but they were providing treatment to patients just because of humanity as the hospital is functioning against norms.

AHMEDABAD: The recital of T M Krishna had swept many young Amdavadis into the rumble, boom, and clatter of conversations. Krishna — a Carnatic vocalist — was making only his first Saptak appearance. Perhaps young people were familiar with him as a persistent questioner, the Socrates from the South. TOI questioned Krishna about this section of his following.“It is wonderful that young people want to listen to questioning,” Krishna told TOI. “All I do is ask difficult questions of myself…I ask what we are. We are at a moment in political history when all of us have to learn a lot from young people.”In universities across the world, young people are questioning the Cannon, intellectual artefacts deemed to be classics. “The word ‘classical’ is deeply problematic,” Krishna said. “Classical is determined by people of the higher echelons of society. Usually, race, caste, and ethnicity are factors that seem to define what is classical.”Socrates is supposed to have said: “The unexamined life is not worth living.” On Sunday, Day 5 of Saptak, ‘culture’ too may have been examined.The final baithak of Day 5 featured the sarod legend Ustad Amjad Ali Khan. Khan-sahab draws throngs of devotees every year not only because of his stature in the Hindustani pantheon but also because of his guru-like generosity in annotating musical complexities.For instance, on Sunday, Khan-sahab dwelt on a Kafi nuance before his second presentation. The knowledgeable felt enlightened and the fledgling rasikas were thrilled just to hear him speak. Khan-sahab had advice for learners too. “It’s my suggestion to students to not blindly imitate legendary musicians,” he told TOI. “They must collect and learn compositions.”After the performance, scores of college-age people gathered around Khan-sahab. It was well past 1am. But he indulged the selfie seekers, who evidently had found something within their selves stirred because of his music.Pandit Shivkumar Sharma’s message to rasikas“I couldn’t come to Saptak this year,” Pandit Shivkumar Sharma, the santoor icon, told TOI. “I will definitely perform next year.” His programme had been scheduled on Monday. However, panditji’s principal tenet was emphasized in Ahmedabad by his disciple Takahiro Arai, who rendered Hamsadhvani on January 2. “Guruji always says that to be a good musician one must be a good human,” Arai told TOI.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73137690,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-478113,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/day-of-thinking-accompanied-by-music/articleshow/73129945.cms

NEW DELHI: More than 1.46 crore people will cast their votes to elect the seventh legislative assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi on February 8.

Chief electoral officer (CEO) of Delhi Ranbir Singh said the final electoral roll, as on January 1, 2020, was published on Monday. According to it, Delhi has 1,46,92,136 voters — 80,55,686 men, 66,35,635 women and 815 people belonging to the third gender.

The Delhi election office has disposed of all applications received till December 16 during the month-long summary revision. “But that does not mean that those filling up the forms now won’t be eligible to cast their votes in the upcoming assembly polls. All applications received till the last date of filing of nominations (January 18) will be included in the supplementary list to ensure that no eligible voter is left out of the election process,” Singh said.

He also said every voter should check the final electoral roll, which is available online and at the voter registration centre in each constituency, to ensure that his name exists on the roll.

According to the data, 3,64,678 more people are eligible to cast their votes this time compared with the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Last May, Delhi had 1,43,27,458 registered voters.

In comparison with the last assembly polls in 2015, the voter count has increased by over 16 lakh. The gender ratio of voters has also improved. While in January 2015, the number of women for every 1,000 male voters was 802, the figure has gone up to 824. Tilak Nagar constituency has the highest gender ratio of 951, while Okhla has the lowest at 677.

During the summary revision exercise, which started with the publication of the draft roll, 2,47,950 voters were added and 60,848 deleted, registering a net increase of 1,87,102 electors, the CEO said. The names of over 12 lakh voters, which could not be verified during an elector verification programme carried out in last September-October, have been kept in a separate list. “These voters could not be verified during our door-to-door verification drive. We will keep special focus on them if they turn up to cast votes,” Singh said.

A detailed exercise of rationalising polling stations was also carried out to decongest the existing ones and merge those having inadequate number of voters. “As a result, the number of polling stations has decreased from 13,816 to 13,750 and that of polling locations from 2,700 to 2,689. This means the requirement of manpower will be less to conduct the polls,” said an election official.

The voter’s slip given to each electorate by the district electoral officers will have a QR code, which will be scanned by polling officials at a helpdesk as soon as the voter enters the polling station, said an official. “A voter’s entry and exit will be recorded in a database through an app. This way, we will know how many voters have exercised their franchise,” Singh said.

Before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, AAP, the ruling party in Delhi, had alleged deletion of names belonging to various communities on the behest of BJP. Singh said no such complaint had been received from any political party this time.

Trichy: Though there was a dip in the footfall of devotees on the grand day of Vaikunda Ekadasi on Monday compared to the previous years, rigid crowd management system enforced by police helped the event pass smoothly. Meanwhile, identity cards issued to journalists and mediapersons by the public relationship office (PRO) of Trichy district collectorate was misused by a section of influential people who were not actually the representatives of media houses.

The procession of Lord Namperumal from sanctum sanctorum to Paramapatha Vaasal via Santhanu mandapam, Rajamahendiran Thirusuttru, Naazhi Kettan gateway and Kulasekaran Suttru involves risky manoeuvre owing to the crowd that trails the processional deity. Devotees, including the VVIPs and their families unwilling to wait for their turns, compete with each to get a close glimpse of the deity and often end up in minor skirmishes with police. However, this Vaikunda Ekadasi, 4,000 police personnel, majority of which were deployed inside the temple corridors, had managed to make the event pass without much trouble. The Naazhi Kettan gateway, Kulasekaran Suttru corridor and Paramapatha Vaasal gateway were manned with adequate policemen armed with ropes and public announcement system.

“Rigid crowd control mechanism is needed to streamline the crowd. As the city police accepted our demand to permit the local people to worship Namperumal via the Vellai gopuram after 5 am on Monday, the Srirangam residents feel contented,” B Hemanathan, a resident of Srirangam, said. Meanwhile, a section of devotees was upset over the preferential treatments given to some people to bypass the queue. People who were neither journalists nor any representative of media houses were also issued media passes and they moved along with the journalists to skip the queue and reach Rajamahendiran Thirusuttru. Owing to this, huge crowd occupied the corridors of the temple during the time of the procession.

Ahmedabad: One day after masked goons went on a rampage inside the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus in New Delhi injuring 18 students and professors, scores of people in Ahmedabad gathered outside the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A) old campus to condemn the violence and its perpetrators. On Monday, as the clock struck 5.15pm, people of all ages began gathering on the footpath outside the B-school, some holding placards others in silence.Protesters included students and professors from premier institutes in the city such as IIM-A, Ahmedabad University, Cept University, Gujarat Law Society (GLS), Gujarat University, Gujarat Vidyapith and MICA, among others.Workers of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) gathered opposite the protesters, shouting slogans against leftist students.Police detained three ABVP workers when they became aggressive and got into a scuffle with police.Inspector H M Vyas of Gujarat University police said, “We detained the ABVP city general secretary Nirav Pandya, ABVP Gujarat University campus in-charge Divyapalsinh Solanki and a worker, Rishit Patel, from the IIM-A.”ABVP spokesperson Samarth Bhatt said, “The three were arrested when they were protesting against left-affiliated students’ wings. We have been portrayed as the accused by the left parties and their students wings.”Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani and activists Nirjhari Sinha, Mallika Sarabhai and Shamshad Pathan, among others were also part of the protest.Leaders, academicians and students said the violence at JNU was deplorable and raised concerns about the safety of students on campuses in Ahmedabad as well. “If my sister gets admission to JNU today, I will be scared, looking at the state of affairs. I strongly condemn what happened there. This can come down to Gujarat. CM Rupani should assure the student community of Gujarat that preventive measures will be taken to ensure such incidents do not take place,” said Mevani. “What happened in JNU was horrific. Such violence has to stop. In fact, in this case, students have given hope at a time when many of us are feeling dejected economically, socially and politically,” said Reetika Khera, a professor at IIM-A.Another IIM-A faculty member, on condition of anonymity, said, “Violence against students is problematic and it raises concerns and a sense of fear that if it happens in Delhi today, it may happen on my campus tomorrow. I fully support the students of JNU and condemn the attack.”Calling the situation in the universities of Gujarat undemocratic, sociologist Manishi Jani, said, “For the past four years, there have been no elections to the student senate of Gujarat University.

413,['7/01/2020'],Vision group members bat for online medical consultation,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Bengaluru: The first meeting of Karnataka’s vision group for healthcare, research and innovation on Monday witnessed heated discussions on a range of medical issues, including the need for tele-medical consultations.

The 20-member committee set up by the government is headed by Dr Devi Shetty, chairman, Narayana Hrudayalaya.

“India has over 70 million diabetics and only 600 diabetologists. Why should a patient meet a doctor for every consultation when it can be done over the phone? When we are allowing a 10-year-old juvenile diabetic patient to take insulin on his/her own, why does the government think online consultation cannot be legal,” asked Dr Shetty. He said in the time of shortage of doctors, technology must be used to meet people’s medical needs.

Dr Sunita Maheshwari, paediatric cardiologist and a member of group, said the Centre has invited tenders for tele-medical consultation, but the Karnataka government says it is ‘not permitted’. “Online consultation is emerging as the norm all over the world. In the West, insurance companies mandate online consultation of patients after discharge to stress on follow up,” she said.

Responding to this, Dr H Veerabhadraiah, president, Karnataka Medical Council, said online medical consultations are not permitted in the state. “The error of margin is more in online consultation, without physical examination,” he pointed out. The doctor is a member of the vision group.

However after much debate, he asked the members to submit a proposal, stressing the need and benefits of online consultations. “The matter will be looked into once the proposal is received by KMC,” he said.

Medical education minister CN Ashwath Narayan said vision group meetings will be held frequently to improve public health service delivery in the state. Five members did not attend the session.

Sachin Pilot

JAIPUR: Congress state chief and deputy CM Sachin Pilot has been playing the role of opposition within the ruling party. But his role as a critic of his own government got appreciation from an unlikely quarter. None other than BJP state president Satish Poonia has lauded Pilot for his role.

Pilot had a few days ago made a statement putting his government in the dock for the death of infants at J K Lon Hospital in Kota.

The state government has been taking cover for the deaths comparing the mortality figures of the previous regime. However, Pilot said such a comparison was uncalled for and the government should fix accountability.

Heaping praise on Pilot, Poonia said, “Pilot is a responsible people’s representative. Iit is a mature response from the ruling party chief.” the deputy CM had said that the state government could not wash its hands off by blaming the previous government after being in power for more than a year.

Poonia said, “I fully endorse the statement of Pilot that accountability in the government had to be fixed for the death of infants in such large numbers.”

The deputy chief minister who also holds the post of the party chief for the last six years in the state has been doing his task quite well. He had earlier put the chief minister and the government on the backfoot by taking to task the government for the poor law and order, incidentally being handled by the chief minister himself.

Pilot has not hesitated to attack his own government’s decision to elect a non-contested candidate to the post of chairperson of civic bodies which the government was forced to backtrack following the intervention of the party central leadership.

According to political experts, Sachin is trying to keep some distance from the government after the chief minister attempted to sideline him in the government. Though technically he is the second in command by virtue of being the deputy chief minister, the chief minister has been projecting PHED minister Dr BD Kalla as his de facto second. He has been made the chairman of almost all cabinet committees.

Meeting journalists on Monday, they recalled the assault they faced, with a visually impaired student sharing that even he wasn’t spared. Some students claimed to have jumped from the second floor of their hostel to escape the hostile mob.Read also: Goons ran riot as cops awaited JNU nodAishe Ghosh, president of JNU Students’ Union, appeared at the press meet with her head in bandages and her hand in a cast. She said that after the peace march organised by JNU Teachers’ Association, she and a friend were having tea when masked intruders began assaulting students and teachers. “I was trying to make my way to my hostel when around 30 men singled me out and surrounded me. Even as I was protesting, someone hit me on my head with an iron rod. I fell down and they thrashed me. I was bleeding profusely before some students came to my aid,” said Ghosh, adding that all her messages to police went unanswered.She said that the ambulance she was in wasn’t allowed to pass the gate. “I had to get out of the ambulance and ask the crowd to clear the way. You can see it was a deliberate attempt to murder me,” the JNUSU president said. Alongside her, Dripta showed her fractured leg and Meithry revealed she had suffered tissue tears on a leg.Visually impaired Surya Prakash, a resident of Sabarmati Hostel, claimed to be in his room, no. 51, when the miscreants barged in. “I told them to leave me alone because I could not see. But they did not listen. My back is badly bruised and there is a swelling on my hand,” said Prakash.Despite her serious injuries, Ghosh appeared defiant. “We will fight it out and every iron rod you hit us with, we will give back with our culture of democratic debate,” she declared on Monday. An MPhil scholar in the School of International Studies, the girl from Durgapur has been at the forefront of several protests in Delhi, including the anti-CAA stir. She is a member of the leftist Students’ Federation of India and was twice the convenor in SIS.In 2019, Ghosh had fought the students’ union poll in September last year as a candidate of the Left Unity, an alliance of leftist student organisations, and beat her rival by 2,313 votes. Popular on the campus for her speeches, Ghosh has been critical of the government on various issues, such as the dilution of the Right to Information Act. She has also fought for changes in the Bill on transgender rights, while accusing the central government of violating human rights in Kashmir.Among those hurt were members of ABVP, alleged by many to be behind Sunday’s violence. Present at a press meet on Monday was Manish Jangid, secretary of ABVP’s JNU unit, and the runner-up to Ghosh in the JNUSU presidential polls. He came with fractured hands. The other ABVP member who suffered injuries were Seshmani Sahu and Shivam Chaurasia. ABVP claimed 11 members were still missing.Jangid charged the leftist student activists with targeting individuals and attacked them around 4pm on Sunday. “They entered my hostel room and broke my laptop, which had my PhD thesis. Who will rewrite it for me?” Jangid claimed. “It is the Left that has been indulging in violence since semester registration began. Even at the hospitals, their national leaders arrived and met them while we were not provided treatment for almost three hours. We were so scared of the violence that some of us slept at the temple in Malviya Nagar.”Jangid also claimed that the Left had implicated them by creating the WhatsApp accounts in which they appeared to be planning the attack on the hostels.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73132063,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-146170,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/masked-brutality-unmasked-by-their-scars/articleshow/73129966.cms
417,['7/01/2020'],Rajasthan government should allot liquor licences to locals: Industry,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Representative image

JAIPUR: As the excise department on Monday held a feedback for framing the liquor policy for 2020-21, the industry said there are many irritants that need to be removed if the government wants to attract better interest from investors.

Rajasthan Liquor Welfare Society, which represents the government retailers, said the department should ensure an assured margin of 20-22% to attract better participation. Early this financial year, the assured margins became a boiling issue between the government and the retailers as the latter said because of cess and other hidden charges, their margin was reduced to 10-12%.

Similarly, the association said the government should also remove the requirement of targets for selling liquor. Recently, many restaurants and hotel bars were issued penalty notices for not selling 10% more liquor.

President of the association Nilesh Mewara said that many a time, the shops allotted in a zone get concentrated in a single location and the department should make a rule of keeping them at a distance of 200 metres.

He said the policy should be for three years instead of the current practice of one year. “By the time we settle down for business, it almost consumes six months. The retailers fail to operate at full capacity throughout the year. That’s why three-year policy with renewal premium is a good proposition,” added Mewara.

The industry body wants the department not to impose any additional duty or cess or undertake any price-related decision in the middle of the year that would impact the margin of the retailers.

“The retailers make application based on the existing charges. Any deviation from this in the middle of the year would impact their margins. If the government wants to impose any duty or cess, they should do that well before the application process,” the industry body said.

Currently, the department is issuing licences to even people from other states. But the industry said that licences should be given to locals as there are many unemployed youth in the state.

Similarly, for relocation of shops, the retailers are required to pay 10% of the licence fees. The industry said that when the licence fees were between Rs 3-5 lakh, it used to be 10%. Since the licence fees have increased to Rs 30 lakh, the relocation charge should be 1-2%.

The long-pending demand of the industry has been to extend the closing time of the retail shops. They said that at least in big cities the timings should be relaxed to 10pm.

KOCHI: Maradu is all set to witness a compelling spectator event on January 11 and 12 when coordinated implosions bring down the highrises in seconds, but the event has the potential to expose onlookers to hazardous levels of air pollution. Pollution control board (PCB) has made elaborate arrangements for monitoring the air quality and level of sound pollution in areas surrounding the apartment complexes after demolition.

PCB sources said they will treat Holy Faith H20 and two towers of Alfa Serene to be demolished on January 11 as one block and Jains Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram as another while monitoring.

To contain the dust and threat of flying debris, PCB has directed agencies engaged in demolition to erect 10ft-high boundary walls around the buildings and use enough sprinklers.

“Events like these are nothing less than a calamity. We expect the dust to rise up to a height of 15ft after demolition,” said a senior PCB official. Sprinklers would be deployed around buildings to control dust through suppression.

“We have zeroed in on the south side of the buildings because the wind direction is from north to south. The exact location to install the equipment would be decided after Tuesday’s site visit,” said the official.

To collect data on dust generated after demolition, PCB would be using respirable dust samplers, which are meant for monitoring the total suspended particles (TSP) in ambient air conditions. “We would be monitoring both PM10 and PM2.5 and the data would be collected for a minimum of eight hours,” he said, adding that monitoring would begin at 11am.

PM10 is particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter, while PM2.5 is particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter and are considered fine particles. Both PM10 and PM2.5 act as gas due to their small size and are harmful for human body because they can penetrate lungs.

PCB has chosen the south side of Jain Housing and Golden Kayaloram to fix their monitoring equipment considering the wind direction. “In Nettoor, the south side is backwaters and we may have to adjust the site accordingly,” the official said.

Both the chairman and the chief environmental engineer would be present at implosion sites to monitor the process and give directives. “We would also have our surveillance team at the spot. We would publish the data within two days after consultation with the chairman,” the source said.

In December, the chairman of state-level monitoring committee had directed PCB to monitor the entire process without giving room for any complaints on environmental pollution.

Nashik: A gang of three has been arrested from Gujarat ’s Dahod district by Nashik rural police for their involvement in number of house break-ins and thefts.

Police have also recovered cash and jewellery worth Rs 3.91 lakh from the suspects — identified as Kantibhai alias Kantgi Tersinghbhai Bhabhore (40), Nana alias Nanu Mandle (27) and Mando alias Tersingh Bhabhor.

Police inspector KK Patil said that large number of house break-ins was being reported under the jurisdiction of the Satana police station.

Patil, part of the rural police’s Local Crime Branch (LCB), said on instructions of superintendent of police Arti Singh they started investigating the case through CCTV footage gathered from spots where the crimes were committed.

“After going through the CCTV footage and other technical data collected by us, we came to the conclusion that the suspects must be from Gujarat which is on the border of Satana taluka,” he said.

“We then sent a team to Jaiswada village in Dahod district. After waiting for three days, the team finally managed to trace the suspects,” he added.

During interrogation the suspects confessed to have committed house break-ins in Satana, Wavi, Nandur Shingote and other parts of the rural district.

“The suspects used to move to different parts of Maharashtra on the pretext of being on pilgrimage and after identifying a closed shop or house, they used to commit the crime,” the officer said, adding that.

While four burglaries were committed in Satana, one each was committed in Wavi (Sinnar taluka) and Deola talukas of the rural district.

On Monday, the suspects were presented before a local court that remanded them in four-day police custody.

HYDERABAD: Hyderabad MP and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday condemned the attack on JNU students and alleged that people who perpetrated violence had BJP’s tacit support. “Modi Sarkar must answer why cops are siding with goons,” he tweeted.

“I condemn the violent behaviour by the cowards who definitely had support of the ruling party. There is no doubt that they have been given the green signal by the powers that be,” the AIMIM chief said at party headquarters, Darussalam.

Continuing his tirade against NDA government, Owaisi said, “I hope the government rises above party affiliations and arrests the perpetrators, who covered their faces. They might have covered their faces, but their ideology has exposed them,” he said.

“For one and half hours, police did not know what was happening. This is the capital of India, on WhatsApp they mobilise people! What is the cyber cell doing? If some lumpen thugs can do this, what about the people who want to harm the integrity of country?” he asked.

“In solidarity with the brave students of JNU. This cruel attack is meant to ‘punish’ JNU students because they dared to stand up. It’s so bad that even Union ministers are tweeting helplessly. Modi Sarkar must answer why cops are siding with goons,” Owaisi tweeted.

However, the hospital authorities claimed that he had not died in the hospital and termed it as a case of LMA (Left the hospital against medical advice).

Kota’s JK Lon Hospital had hit the headlines in December 2019 when 10 infants were reported dead within 48 hours on December 23 and 24, prompting central and state delegations to visit the hospital. The hospital recorded 100 infants’ deaths in December 2019, while 77 infants’ death in December 2018.

Two newborn babies died in JK Lon Hospital on Monday said Dr Suresh Dulara, superintendent of the hospital.

A three-day-old newborn, suffering from severe birth asphyxia was on ventilator and died during treatment at 1.15am on intervening nights of Sunday and Monday, deputy superintendent, Dr Gopikrishan Sharma said. It is yet to be verified from where the deceased newborn was referred to JK Lon, he added. Another three-day-old infant died between on Monday morning, he said and added that the infant was born in the same hospital and was put on ventilator after he suddenly fell ill. The infant was given mother’s milk in the morning following which he suffered from breathing complications. Dr Sharma added that sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is likely to be the cause of the death.

Clarifying about another five-year-old boy’s death in the hospital on Monday, the deputy superintendent told TOI that the boy was suffering from cerebral palsy since birth and was admitted here three days ago with severe breathing problem and pneumonia. His condition was deteriorating and on Monday he was put on ventilator. The parents, assuming him to be dead, insisted on taking him home. However, he was still breathing. Finally, the parents took him home around 11am and the hospital registered the case as (LMA), he added.

Meanwhile, the family of the five -year-old boy protested outside the hospital alleging negligence by the doctors.

On Monday Dr Jagdish Singh was appointed to one of the posts as professor in paediatric department here.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A man, allegedly enraged over breakup with his lover, slit the woman’s throat and killed her at Karakkonam on Monday.

Anu, 23, barged into the residence of Ashika, 22, and slit her throat. Later, he wounded himself and succumbed to injuries in a hospital.

Vellarada police, which was probing the case, said that both Ashika and Anu were in a relationship and they split around six months ago and the rejection is believed to have provoked Anu to commit the murder.

While Ashika died instantly, Anu was rushed to Karakonam Medical College first and later to Trivandrum Medical College where he succumbed to cut wounds.

The body of Ashika is currently kept at Karakonam Medical College and Anu’s body is at Trivandrum Medical College, which will both be handed over to relatives after postmortem on Tuesday.

According to Vellarada station house officer inspector K Biju, the incident took place around 11:30am on Monday when only Ashika and her grandparents were at home. “Anu, who carried a kitchen knife with him, barged into the house and locked the door from inside, which prevented Ashika’s grandparents from intervening. He slit her throat first and then slit his own throat. When the neighbours broke into the house, they saw both lying in a pool of blood,” the inspector said.

Karakonam ward member R Sujeer said that both Ashika and Anu were in a relationship which turned sour around six months ago and even resulted in a complaint being filed by Ashika’s father at Vellarada police station.

“Parents of both Ashika and Anu had attended the meeting chaired by Vellarada CI, which concluded with Anu assuring that he will not disturb Ashika again. Anu used to work as a conductor in private vehicles while Ashika was doing a beautician course. Both families come from struggling backgrounds and such an unexpected tragedy has put both families in distress,” he said.

Ashika leaves behind father Ajith who works as a painter, mother Seema who is a homemaker and a younger brother.

Anu leaves behind father Mani who is working as a mason, mother Ramani, a tailor, and an elder brother Manu who works in Chennai.

Nashik: The Panchavati police on Monday organised street plays for the residents of Ramkund and Panchavati areas to educated them about the seriousness of obeying traffic rules.

As part of Maharashtra Police Raising Day celebrations street plays were arranged on the theme of following traffic rules. Passers-by stopped by to watch the plays and appreciated the police and the students of NBT Law College, who enacted the play.

The police said that the aim was to emphasise on the results of neglecting traffic rules, which was portrayed through a street play . They stressed on how one can lose his / her life if the concerned person was not wearing a helmet while riding a two-wheeler. At the same time how speaking on cell-phone while driving could be dangerous. In the end, they also administered the oath of following traffic rules to the people who watched the street play.

A large number of people lose their lives on the city streets. The police said that human error was one of the main reasons for accidents. They said that if simple traffic rules are followed, those driving vehicles on the streets and highways would not only save themselves from accidents but also save other motorists and people on the road. “Many people do not know that if the seat-belt is not put on the protective air-bags do not open up in case of accidents and people could lose their life for such small negligence,” said the officer.

According to the police, this year 176 people lost their lives in road accidents. Apart from this many other people were injured grievously and got paralysed permanently.

Protest against JNU campus violence live updates.

NEW DELHI: A day after being blindsided by a masked, lathi-wielding mob that spread violence and terror through the campus, Jawaharlal Nehru University is putting the pieces together. Teachers and students have linked hands in a human chain. Leaders of the students’ union, hurt and shaken, are rallying others at the spot where the attack started.Who, exactly, were the attackers shouting slogans of “goli maaro saalon ko” and “Bharat Mata”? How did they get in, and why weren’t they stopped in time? What was the larger motive for the attack, or was it just an expression of hatred? These questions remain unanswered, but the direction is clear.Read also: Goons ran riot as cops awaited JNU nod“They knew whom to target, whose car to vandalise. Specific teachers were attacked, and in the hostels, some students’ rooms were wrecked. Muslims, Kashmiris were singled out,” alleged a student. They tried to forcibly enter the home of a professor, Bikramaditya Kumar Chaudhuri, and threatened his wife while the police refused to come and help, said his colleague BS Butola, who pointed out that the records of who came into the campus on Sunday were now missing. “There was complete connivance between the police, JNU security and the mob,” alleged Nivedita Menon, professor of political science.“It adds to the sense of vulnerability,” said Professor Rajat Datta from School of Social Sciences, who has also studied in JNU. “I have been here for 28 years, and seen many ideological battles, but it has never been expressed in this violent way,” he added.Read also: HCU to AMU to JNU, campuses new battlefield for ideological warBorn in the tumultuous 1960s, JNU has always been a crucible of student idealism and politics. After the Emergency, the JNU students’ union, led by Sitaram Yechury, forced Indira Gandhi to resign as chancellor of the university. It has housed many ideologies and movements: communist, socialist, liberal and anti-caste, regional and, lately, also the Right. They have argued and fought and politicked. A whole set of legislators, including at least two ministers in the Modi government, have roots in JNU. So do civil servants, academics, journalists and executives, because apart from its political activity, its rhetoric and slogans and graffiti, JNU has been a unique academic model that welcomes a diverse set of students from across India. JNU was not about looking up to Oxford or Cambridge or any other “world class university”, as Rakesh Batabyal wrote in his history of JNU — it was about a home-grown democratic modernity, built to nurture Indian minds. Much of our best-known scholarship came from within its interdisciplinary schools, and its intellectuals both followed and broke out of the political and academic currents of their time.Read also: WhatsApp groups used to mobilise crowd under lensBut this is New India, one opposed to the JNU ethos. JNU vice-chancellor, M Jagadish Kumar, has been locked in confrontation with students and faculty since he joined. “Even during the Vajpayee government, JNU saw an an ideological campaign to change its character, but institutional norms were not touched,” Datta added.In 2016, JNU students peacefully marking the hanging of Afzal Guru were embroiled in a sedition case and tarred as “tukde tukde gang”, on the basis of clips later found to be doctored. A section of media has maligned JNU as a hub of anti-nationals, anarchists, moral deviants and freeloaders.The university has also been needled on many fronts, all of which have created uproar. The recent decision to hike fees threatens to change the character of JNU as a truly public university — if implemented, faculty estimates that 28% of the current student body would have to drop out immediately. The exam format has been changed — computerised, in English — and entirely taken out of the faculty’s influence, they worry that it will push out the most marginalised students, for whom JNU was once a ladder of opportunity, and who made JNU what it is.“JNU stands in the way of both Hindu Rashtra and of the possibility that critical thinking can be destroyed,” said Menon. But this time, she felt that the government and administration were betraying their nervousness, as young people around the country showed up in public in large numbers. “JNU won’t back down,” she said.In Video: Delhi: Changing the character of JNU, bit by bit",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73131741,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-716659,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/changing-the-character-of-jnu-as-we-know-it-bit-by-bit/articleshow/73129981.cms

Kolkata: A rally organised by Jadavpur University ( JU ) students to protest against Sunday’s violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) neared flashpoint after it came face to face with a BJP procession near Sulekha crossing on Monday evening.

Police had to resort to a mild lathi-charge to disperse students and BJP workers after both sides breached barricades and nearly came to blows. The JU students claimed that BJP workers hurled stones and bricks at them and claimed that the police action against them was uncalled for. DCP (South Suburban Division) Sudip Sarkar said, “While we were chasing some trouble makers, some students entered the mob. We could not differentiate the students from BJP workers who were burning tyres. We did not lathicharge students.”

BJP denied that its workers incited violence.While some JU students set BJP flags ablaze, the BJP workers set tyres on fire as passers-by scampered in fear. BJP leader and former MP Anupam Hazra said: “We had permission to march till Jadavpur police station. We had intimated the police well in advance. How could they stop us?”

Tension prevailed in the area for nearly an hour till the BJP workers dispersed. The students, however, resorted to a roadblock near the 8B bus stand from around 8.30pm, vowing to stand by those attacked at JNU. The situation may have worsened had a rally by CPM cadres got close to the spot. The CPM workers were also protesting against Sunday’s attack at JNU.

The students’ rally that came face to face with the BJP workers was the fourth march of the day from JU campus. The first one was brought out by SFI, which leads the Arts Faculty Students Union (AFSU). The procession went around the campus before spilling out on Raja S C Mullick Road. Commuters and locals, though inconvenienced, didn’t seem to mind though and waited for nearly 10 minutes till around 2.30 pm till the students re-entered the campus. Kolkata police commissioner Anuj Sharma said, “Police are making all efforts to coperate with students and law-abiding citizens to maintain peace. Senior officers are in the Jadavpur area to help people.”

Holding aloft banners and accusing the BJP of treading a fascist path, the students shouted slogans such as: ‘Tomar booke Nathuram, amar booke Kshudiram (You have Nathuram in your heart, while we think of Kshudiram)’ and ‘Tomar Mukhe Savarkar, Amar Mukhe Ambedkar (You talk of Savarkar while we talk of Ambedkar)’. Apart from students from the arts faculty, there were some from the science streams. “We stand in solidarity with them. Every attempt by the fascist government to destroy the mass students’ movements will now be dealt with equal resistance by us,” said Debraj Debnath, general secretary of the SFI unit at JU.

The second rally of the day was called by all departments of JU and this saw a large turnout. Many carried tambourines and sang songs of protest while going around the campus and then up to the Jadavpur police station. Even members of the Jadavpur University Teachers Association (JUTA) expressed their solidarity with the students. “We plan to form a joint team along with teachers of other institutes and send a delegation to meet JNU students,” said physics teacher Partha Pratim Roy who is the general secretary of JUTA.

The third rally was by the teachers that started from Gandhi Bhavan ended at the 8B bus stand. Students from other institutions stopped by to express solidarity. “Attacks on the student community is not acceptable,” said Raunak Saha, a student of Asutosh College.

GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat Congress demanded the resignation of chief minister Vijay Rupani in the wake of the release of infant death figures in government hospitals across the state, including in the CM’s hometown Rajkot. State government spokesperson and deputy CM Nitin Patel countered Congress’s statements and said that state Congress leaders should also ask Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot to resign. “Instead of politicizing a serious and tragic issue, the Congress should rather ask its Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot to resign,” Patel said.

After visiting Rajkot government hospital, from where one of the highest figures of infant deaths have been reported, Amit Chavda, Gujarat Congress president said on Monday, “The large number of deaths of children in government hospitals has exposed the tall claims of good governance by the BJP . The recent all-India governance index shows Gujarat is among the worst states in health services. CM Vijay Rupani must accept moral responsibility and resign.’’

Paresh Dhanani, leader of opposition (LOP) in the state assembly added, “Gujarat’s health sector itself needs better treatment. Instead of accepting responsibility and taking corrective action, the government is coming up with excuses.”

429,['7/01/2020'],Pending trial doesn’t rob one of right to passport,"This story is from January 7, 2020

AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court granted permission to Gulamhussain Shaikh (37) to obtain a new passport with the observation that pending criminal proceedings against a person does not curtail his right to obtain a passport.

The court made the observations about the right of the accused after the state government vehemently opposed Shaikh’s application for permission to obtain a new passport. A metropolitan court had in November 2019 rejected Shaikh’s request for permission to apply for the passport.

Shaikh has been implicated in a copyright violation case, and is facing trial in the metropolitan court. After he was denied permission to get a new passport, which he claimed he needed, Shaikh approached the city sessions court and sought permission with the assertion that the denial of permission for issue of a new passport amounts to violation of his fundamental rights.

The state government continued to oppose Shaikh’s demand. Finally, the government put forth a condition for Shaikh, that he would have to surrender his passport if he was issued a new one. Shaikh agreed to this. The government told the court that it had no objection if Shaikh followed the condition.

The sessions court quashed the metropolitan court’s order and permitted Shaikh to apply for a passport.

Additional sessions judge Sachin Sethi said, “This court is of the considered opinion that though the applicant-accused could not have claimed his visit abroad as a matter of right but issuance of passport is certainly a matter which requires consideration. Apart from that, it is worthwhile to mention here that in any criminal case any person who is accused of any offence is presumed to be innocent until proved guilty, hence mere pendency of a criminal case can be no ground to deny issuance of passport, since presumption of innocence is a human right.”

Nashik: Two elderly women were robbed of their gold chains by unidentified suspects in Panchavati and Mumbai Naka areas of the city on Sunday morning.

In the first incident, a 68-year-old woman was targeted at 9.30am by two bike-borne suspects near Tulsi Eye Hospital close under the jurisdiction of the Mumbai Naka police station.

The victim, a resident of General Vaidya Nagar, was near the hospital when the suspects came from behind and snatched her gold chain worth Rs 45,000 before fleeing.

The second incident took place in Chakradhar Nagar area of Panchavati at around 11.15 am. According to police, the 69-year-old woman was standing near the gate of her bungalow and speaking to the neighbours when two bike-borne suspects stopped near the woman on the pretext of asking an address.

“When the elderly woman told them that she was not aware of any such building, the suspect riding pillion snatched her gold chain and escaped on the bike,” a police officer said.

Until December 29, 2019, city police have registered as many as 87 cases of chain snatchings. In 2018, a total of 71 such cases were reported.

Of the total 87 chain snatchings last year, police have detected only 38 cases — detection rate of 54%.

HYDERABAD: How did Hyderabadis pull off the Million March on January 4 and managed a huge turnout? While the response was spontaneous with as many as 40 NGOs and three political parties taking an active part, it was meticulous planning that did the trick, claimed the organisers.

Hundreds of volunteers drew a complete map on who would be doing what. And this included asking a few hundred not to join the protest. Their job was to stay away from the rally and clean the premises soon after the conclusion of the rally at Dharna Chowk, Indira Park, at 5pm.

As many as 400 doctors were mobilised for anyone who needed medical help. At different places, 400 advocates were asked to stay put. Nearly 20 ambulances were parked near a hospital at Indira Park. The joint action committee members spoke to private hospitals in advance to immediately admit anyone needing medical care and not insist on advance being paid.

From Bholakpur alone, 3,000 protesters converged at Dharna Chowk. A local leader provided food packets and water bottles to protesters. A doctor, who is also an IT professional, got placards for protesters and also signboards to show where parking lots were. One leader from Mahbubnagar transported a few thousand protesters in 50 buses. This was in addition to buses which came from other districts.

The protesters were strictly given instructions not to come triple riding to the venue. At all the flyovers, volunteers were put on the job of ensuring that no one would stop to take selfies or take a look down at the procession of people below.

Another important precaution was taken to avoid any trouble with political group activists. Sources said the responsibility was given to Dalit organisations and individuals who could speak Telugu well and handle any situation that warranted their interference. “The main focus was on keeping the protest peaceful,” said MBT leader Amjed Ullah Khan. The focus of JAC is now on fighting cases that have reportedly been filed in 22 police stations against JAC convenor Mushtaq Malik.

“Police mentioned Mustaq Malik and others in the cases. That means they will book a huge number of persons to harass them. They also videographed people and their vehicles when they were heading for protest. We will meet the DGP and home minister to drop the cases,” Amjed Ullah Khan said.

JAIPUR: Reacting to the attacks on JNU students, chief minister Ashok Gehlot in a tweet late on Monday accused the BJP of ruining universities.

“Condemn the attacks taking place in JNU strongly. Students, teachers have been beaten up, hostels vandalised and no police inside to stop this, which is most shocking. Why police is not doing anything to protect students? BJP’s divisive politics is ruining the universities.#SOSJNU”

Some residents in the area attacked the house of the person who captured the video, alleging apathy for not trying to rescue to the person. There are also allegations that the excise officials too did not bother to rescue him.

The youth Karalath Veettil Akshay, 20, of Triprayar had jumped into the river at Keezhpallikkara when excise officials raided the area on Saturday evening. The raids were a sequel to reports that several people were regularly assembling at a house there and indulging in drug abuse and drinking.

The group of people who had assembled there had run off when they saw the approaching excise team. Akshay jumped into the river and his body was recovered only on Sunday. Some in the area alleged that the excise and fire brigade officials were indifferent to the pleas for continued search, which led to the delay in the recovery of the body.

Meanwhile, nearby residents noticed that the custodian of the house, Santhosh, instead of rescuing Akshay, was busy shooting the video while he drowned. Later, Santosh’s house was attacked for which 13 persons have been arrested.

Deputy commissioner of excise P K Sanu said the department has ordered a probe into Akshay’s death. The joint excise commissioner and assistant excise commissioner will be visiting the area as part of the probe. Initially, a case of ‘man missing’ was registered, which has now been converted into a case of ‘unnatural death’, Anthikkad SI Haneesh said. tnn

437,['7/01/2020'],"Don’t withhold domestic helps’ pay, they may seek revenge: Cops","This story is from January 7, 2020

AHMEDABAD: To go with their regular projecting of ethnic and casteist profiles when they describe offences or crimes, city police have come up with “safety tips” for citizens which betray a certain class bias too. They advise citizens not to withhold the pay of their domestic workers not because it would be unfair, but because “they may take revenge”.

The city police’s website, in a segment containing safety tips, gives 25 pointed suggestions to citizen. Some of them are on how to deal with domestic help.

One safety tips reads, “Do not withhold pay, derogate (sic) or mistreat domestic workers. They may seek revenge.”

It also says, “Do not open cupboards, show valuables or discuss financial matters in front of domestic help. They may be tempted to carry out an unlawful act.”

A police official said these safety tips pertaining to domestic help were given as the city reported a gruesome murder of a 75-year-old woman, who was bludgeoned to death by her domestic help at her home in Naranpura in February 2017. After that, city police began an intensive drive to register domestic helps, apparently to thwart their involvement in crimes.

Apart from domestic help, the cops also provide tips on how to deal with vegetable vendors, washer men and milkmen. “Install safety features such as a peephole facility, safety latch or iron grill so that you can scan each visitor before allowing them entry. Be extra careful while allowing unknown persons like vegetable sellers, washermen and milkmen inside.”

Cops have also provided some life advice in the safety tips, “Develop a network of friends and talk to your neighbor to ensure that you do not live a secluded life. Go for regular walks in groups and socialize.”

Officials said 35 kg of heroin, worth Rs 175 crore in the international market, was seized from the boat.ATS sources said the consignment was to land at Jakhau. From there, it was to be delivered to an Afghan national in Delhi who is in the national capital on medical visa.Senior ATS sources said that the Pakistanis arrested told them that the consignment was to be dispatched to other countries through the Afghan national. Those arrested are being jointly interrogated by various agencies.This is the fourth major seizure of contraband from off the Gujarat coast since 2017. “For the past year and a half, Gujarat has emerged as a transit point for the Pakistan-based drug mafia to smuggle narcotics to other countries. Earlier, an Afghan national, Niyamat Khan, who also was in India on a medical visa, was arrested for smuggling 100kg of heroin out of India through South India,” a senior ATS source said.Deputy inspector general of police, ATS, Himanshu Shukla, said they received intelligence that a consignment of heroin was going to be smuggled into Gujarat at Jakhau.ACP ATS B P Rojiya had got this input and alerted senior cops.

A vandalised car outside JNU campus tells a tale of destruction

NEW DELHI: Teachers were also not spared of the horror on Sunday with one of them being grievously injured . Teachers staying at Transit House had a harrowing time as the masked miscreants, armed with roads and sticks, chased members of their families and banged on the doors and windows.

Teachers recounted how it was difficult for them to hold the stones of half brick size which were thrown at them. A group of them later wrote to the President of India, regarding the violence in the campus and demanded sacking of the vice-chancellor.

Bikramaditya Kumar Choudhary, a teacher at the Centre for Regional Development, recounted how his wife had a narrow escape on Sunday. “She had gone for a walk and suddenly came back and started shouting, asking me to open the door. More than 100 men were chasing her. She entered the house and then we shut the door putting tables and cupboard. I then called up the security officer, police and the administration but no one responded,” said Choudhary who lives in Transit House. “The armed men wanted to terrorise us,” added Choudhary.

Teachers have also demanded an independent inquiry into the matter.

Sucharita Sen was the most injured and had to be taken to the hospital. Amit Thorat was the first one, who was attacked by the goons, when he was cycling. He somehow escaped and then informed the other teachers gathered at the peace march about the miscreants roaming around in the campus.

“They pushed me on the pavement and I fell. Then they started beating us. But after some point they said that I was not the one and then walked past. It looked like a planned attack with specific targets,” said Saugata Bhaduri from the School of language. Two other female teachers—Sonajharia Minz and Shukla Sawant were also injured due to the attack. “I tried to dodge the stones that were being pelted. Miscreants had rods and other equipment, which they were swinging indiscriminately,” said Minz.

Meanwhile, JNUTA has said that the VC is no longer capable of providing safety and demanded his resignation.

Another teacher group— the JNU teachers federation (JNUTF) condemned the violence and said the hostel wardens of the Sabarmati were chased and beaten up. In a statement, JNUTF said, “This culture of violence by masked gangs is extremely disturbing and needs to be thoroughly investigated by the administration.”

440,['7/01/2020'],Common mobility card still on paper; BMRC misses deadline,"Representative image

TimesView Once again we have an example of the inability — intentional or otherwise — of the city’s infrastructure providers to coordinate in a way that would make things simpler for citizens. Whether it’s BBMP, BWSSB, Bescom or BMRCL and BMTC, this behaviour seems to have become a constant feature. The common mobility card, by itself, is a convenience and no more. But the failure to go through with it exemplifies a lackadaisical attitude. It would help if officials with these organisations saw themselves as public servants and not as whimsical benefactors.

Kochi shows the way

BENGALURU: The country’s tech capital has once again missed the deadline to get a common mobility card that can be used on Metro trains and buses.Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd ( BMRCL ) had promised to open four automatic fare collection (AFC) gates that would accept the cards at Nadaprabhu Kempegowda and Byappanahalli stations on a pilot basis from January 1. However, it hasn’t been done and the new deadline is yet to be announced.Rajkumar Dugar, convenor of NGO Citizens for Citizens said, “Bengaluru is an IT hub and it’s unfortunate that the common mobility card has remained on paper for more than five years. The card will help improve public transport ridership, reduce small-change problems and offer hassle-free commute. The delay is due to poor coordination between BMTC and BMRCL, mainly for revenue sharing.”BMRCL managing director Ajay Seth was unavailable for comment. However, sources said Bengaluru was yet to get a Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) to coordinate multiple modes of transport and to come up with initiatives like common mobility cards.Many smaller Indian cities are showing the way, though. In Kochi, for instance, a prepaid Kochi1 card was launched by Kochi Metro and Axis Bank to be used in Metro and private buses. In 2015, Kochi Metro Railway Limited (KMRL) signed a contract with Axis Bank in which the bank invested about Rs 100 crore for installation of the Automatic Fare Collection System. KMRL will get a royalty and about 20% of the revenue from the use of debit cards in transactions outside the Kochi Metro system. Axis Bank co-branded debit cards have been issued to Metro users. The bank will also maintain AFC system for 10 years.BMRCL spent its own funds for the expenditure required for AFC. With private buses dominating in Kochi, KMRL signed an agreement with seven private bus companies and all these buses now accept Kochi1 card. “At present, 100 private buses accept Kochi1 cards. Axis Bank has provided electronic ticketing machines for buses. We will soon extend this to about 1,000 buses,” said a senior KMRL official.Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) along with Axis Bank had launched an open-loop smart card in June 2016, but it was scrapped recently. The central government launched the National Common Mobility Card project, also known as One Nation One Card, in March 2019 for seamless travel through various transport modes. But it is yet to be implemented in Bengaluru.According to BMRCL officials, existing AFC gates at Phase 1 stations need to be upgraded to accept new open-loop cards. AFC gates at Phase 2 stations will be compatible.In 2011, BMTC along with BMRCL launched Metro-Bus Transit (MBT) passes: Saral (unlimited BMTC AC buses and Metro) and Saraag (unlimited BMTC non-AC buses and Metro), priced at Rs 110 and Rs 70 respectively. However, the daily passes were discontinued for lack of patronage.Globally, Hong Kong’s Octopus card, London’s Oyster card and Japan’s Suica card are not only used on buses and the Metro but also accepted for making payments in retail shops. Navigo Pass in Paris, Pasmo in Tokyo, SPTC in Shanghai, Nol Card in Dubai, SmartLink in New York and Singapore Tourist Pass Singapore are also popular.in Singapore are also popular.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73131069,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-230432,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/common-mobility-card-still-on-paper-bmrc-misses-deadline/articleshow/73129201.cms

KOLKATA: College Street , which is often identified as the educational hub, on Monday evening turned into focal point of protests against the attack on students of Jawaharlal Nehru University by masked goons on Sunday.The bustling street, flanked by colleges and universities on either side and lined with hundreds of bookshops, reverberated with slogans by protesters venting their anger, anxiety and hurt.As the evening progressed, thousands joined in and staged multiple protests, demanding action against the perpetrators of violence on JNU students and resignation of home minister Amit Shah for his failure to curb violence against students. On Sunday evening, videos of the violence and pictures of bleeding faces of the students along with images of the goons quickly spread on social media, evoking shock and outrage.Teachers and professors from various colleges and universities reached the spot not just to support the protesting students but to also guard them from any provocation. “India belongs to its women and children, Muslims and Dalits, tribals and members of the LGBTQI community. Indian belongs to its marginalized people too. Who made these fascists the custodians of Hindu religion? Who are they to decide that who will stay in this country and who will be ousted? They have now unleashed brutal violence on the student community and those who are questioning them,” said Pradip Basu, dean of humanities and social sciences at Presidency University.A group of students from the university started marching towards the state headquarters of BJP on Murlidhar Sen Lane behind the institute, but police stopped them. Professor Basu urged everyone resist. “I am in my sixties. But I could not stop myself from feeling angry after seeing the state of the country. It will be a blunder to dismiss these attacks on students as isolated incidents. Today they are targeting students, tomorrow they will upon all of us,” said Basu.Another protest march by members of Civil Society from College Street to Raj Bhavan saw a participation of more than 2,000 people. They raised slogans of ‘azaadi’ (freedom from oppression, fascism and majoritarianism) and sang Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s ‘hum dekhenge’.Srija Ray, a second-year student of Presidency University, participated in one of the marches, wore a black badge throughout the day as a mark of protest.“Time has come to take a stand. Fees are being increased manifold while funds for research are being curtailed. If students question such moves, police and goons are unleashed upon on them. Bigots want to turn colleges and universities into laboratories of Hindutva,” Ray said.Protesters said that every action of the central government, which is against the citizens, will be met with resistance. Campuses across the country erupted in violence last month after cops launched a crackdown on students of Jamia Millia Islamia University and Aligarh Muslim University after they protested against CAA and NRC. Alleged police brutalities led to tens of thousands of youths across the nation expressing solidarity with the victims.“We want to tell them that silencing people is not so easy. They will use violence and state machinery to quell our movement, but it is too late.

BENGALURU/BALLARI: Former minister BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan of the Congress set a one-week deadline for the BJP government on Monday to arrest Ballari City BJP legislator G Somashekhara Reddy for his recent speech warning Muslims of dire consequences if they continue to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Police have already booked Reddy, younger brother of tainted mining baron G Janardhan Reddy , under section 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion) of the Indian Penal Code .

However, Khan took the fight to Reddy a step further. “If the government fails to arrest Reddy by January 13, I will stage a dharna outside his house in Ballari, come what may. Let them do whatever they want,” Khan told reporters in Bengaluru.

In his speech at a pro-CAA rally organized by BJP workers and ABVP activists in Ballari, the BJP legislator had said, “We [Hindus] are 83% and they [Muslims] are 17% and if we take law into hands, you know what will happen.”

Khan said on Monday, “I challenge Reddy, the coward, to unsheathe his sword and cut me down first. It is absolutely shameful for a legislator to speak such things against a particular community. Why is Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who often says Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, silent?”

On his part, Reddy on Monday said he stood by what he said. “What I meant was you Muslims should not get swayed by CAA protests and damage public property. We [Hindus] are sons of the same mother and live peacefully. However, they [Muslims] should not test our [Hindu] patience. I stick by my words 100%,” he said.

A delegation of the Ballari district Congress unit also submitted an appeal to the deputy commissioner, inspector general of police and superintendent of police on Monday to arrest Reddy for his provocative speech.

443,['7/01/2020'],Rural distress hits silver demand; imports down 40%,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Ahmedabad: Agriculture and rural distress has hit demand for silver to a great extent in 2019. The import of silver declined by 40% year-on-year in 2019. The precious metal’s imports fell from 150.7 metric tonne (MT) in 2018 to 89.9MT in 2019, according to data by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex.

Silver price stood at Rs 49,600 per kg in the Ahmedabad market on Saturday. Analysts said that demand for both silver in terms of bullion as well as jewellery has declined. “With an acute water scarcity situation in the initial part of the year, and excess rainfall in the later half, rural incomes were affected to a great extent. This is clearly visible in the mounting burden of bad loans in the agriculture sector. Silver demand across the country is largely driven by people in the rural areas. With majority of rural population reeling under stress due to such an agrarian crisis, silver imports have declined,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).

Analysts also blame it on the prices of silver which remained significantly high throughout the year. “Due to slowing economic scenario, the cashflow situation is a major concern with several businesses and industrial sectors reeling under liquidity crisis amid stretched payment cycles. Moreover, price of silver also remained fairly high throughout the year, which deterred investments,” Acharya added.

Jewellers said that the amount of silver recycled is also very high. “Just like gold, silver purchases have also remained muted due to high prices and cashflow crisis. Moreover, there is a high degree of recycling in silver purchases as well. People come with previously purchased silver to buy new jewellery and thus, overall imports got affected,” said Ashish Zaveri, media convener, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA).

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat has earned the dubious distinction of being the worst among coastal states of the country in conserving marine and coastal resources. In the recently released sustainable development goals (SDG) index 2019-20, Gujarat stands at the bottom of the nine coastal states of India.While Karnataka, with a composite score of 65 in the SDG named ‘Life Under Water’ ranks best among the nine coastal states, Gujarat has a dismal composite score of 28 on this SDG. Coastal states have been ranked by Niti Aayog on parameters like water quality index, development of mangroves, use of nitrogen fertilisers in coastal areas, marine acidity levels and development of aquaculture.Despite the fact that Gujarat boasts of the longest coastline in the country of 1,600 kilometres, only 1.2 per cent of available potential area has been developed under aquaculture and there has been an increase of just 2.98 % in the mangrove cover in the past year. The water quality index of the state is also lowest among all the nine coastal states.However, the indicators and their values under this SDG have not been used in determining the overall score of the state, as only nine states have a coastline.

File photo of health department office

JAIPUR: The deaths of 112 infants in 37 days in JK Lon Hospital in Kota due to shortage of medical equipment, poor infrastructure and vacant post of doctors/nursing staff prove that the state health budget had been falling short to meet the basic needs in the healthcare system.

Figures say in the current financial year, the health budget of Rs 13,039 crore constitute for about 5.90% of the total budget. The budgetary allocation for healthcare in the last two financial years 2017-18 and 2018-19 was 6.07% and 6.05%, respectively.

The preliminary reports say that cause of deaths was poor facilities like shortage of warmers, heaters, seats in intensive care units, oxygen cylinders and other medical equipment. These facilities are bought under capital funds within the health budget. Irony is that the capital budget had been least spend in the last few years. The average figure says that from 2014-15 to 2017-18, less than 50% of the capital funds had been utilised in the previous government.

Nisar Ahmed of Budget Analysis and Research Centre Trust (BARC), a research centre which monitors state budget, expenditure and spending said, “The deaths of infants shouldn’t be seen as a phenomena occurred overnight or in the last few months. It is a cumulative failure of the poor budgetary allocation added with unspent capital funds. Questions should also be raised to the previous government for not spending the amount for f building facilities,” said Ahmed.

Data procured from state budget pages says that budgetary allocation has increased by 9.61% from 2018-19 to 2019-20 while the health budget show insignificant rise of just 1.76% by the present Congress government.

“The previous government has not only neglected health budget, but spent on the privatisation of health services. The focus was on health insurance schemes at the cost of primary healthcare schemes by former CM Vasundhara Raje government,” said Chhaya Pancholi, a healthcare activist.

The rise of health budget (in %) in proportion to the state budget in the financial years—2016-17, 2017-18 were 2018-19 were 1.29/9.74, 2.24/10.34 and 18.3/31.41 respectively. According to self-confession by health minister Raghu Sharma, the JK Lone Hospital in Kota has an unspent amount of Rs 6 crore under the medical relief society of the hospital. TOI had repeatedly called up the health minister, but got no response.

MUMBAI: Making an online inquiry for a massage service landed a 30-year-old jewellery designer in trouble. After he refused the Rs 50,000 service, he saw his wife’s photograph posted on a dating app and her fake profile described her as a sex worker. MIDC police said the fraudster did this to extort money from the man for the inquiry call he made on December 14.

The fraudster allegedly gathered his information from Facebook and used a morphed photograph of his wife to extort money.

The designer lives in Palghar and works in Andheri. “He received links to the dating app on WhatAspp while at work in Andheri on December 16. We are tracking the number on which the victim had made calls to inquire about the service. The fraudster seems to be part of a racket that targets people who go online for sex chats and sex workers. They then blackmail them into parting with money or threaten to malign them on social media,” said a police officer.

The victim first called the fraudster on December 14 after coming across the number online. In his complaint, he said, “The person took my number and sent photos of five women. He asked me to pick one for the service and asked me to drop by at his Churchgate service centre. I refused to do so and asked him to send the woman to Palghar, for which the person asked me to transfer Rs 50,000. I disconnected the line as I thought the amount was too high.”

NEW DELHI: The day after the mob attack , students and teachers of Jawaharlal Nehru University recounted the horrors of Sunday night. Fearful about their safety, many students left for home despite the university being fortified by police presence. Those still on campus formed a human chain from the lawns of Sabarmati Hostel till the main gate, demanding both the resignation of vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar and an independent inquiry into the first incident of its type in JNU ’s 50-year history.On Monday, the VC issued a statement in which he attributed the violence to students protesting over hiked hostel fees and the move to stop students from registering for the winter semester. However, many others on the campus alleged that the masked intruders were members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the RSS-affiliated student organisation. They also accused the administration of collusion with the attackers.ABVP retorted that the people who went on a rampage on the campus were mostly students from Jamia Millia Islamia and that left activists who wanted to disrupt the semester registration process.Sabarmati Hostel bore the marks of the mob attack, the 42 rooms there strewn with glass shards and debris. Periyar Hostel too bore signs of the violence. Congress functionary Sharmistha Mukherjee inspected this hostel on Monday.Radha Jattav, a first year master’s degree student and resident of Ganga Hostel, said she saw people being beaten when she left the library. “Thank god, the library closes early on Sundays, else the goons would have entered and created the same situation as in Jamia,” Jattav shuddered. “Since nobody wanted to be on the ground floor in case of an attack, six of us spent the night in one room. One of them, a person with disability, was so overcome that she left for home in the morning.”While Jattav plans to go home in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday, Nitin Rakesh, a School of International Studies student and Jhelum Hostel resident, did not tarry. Before leaving for Lucknow on Monday, he said, “I am afraid as is my family. I will return when things normalise.”A PhD scholar recalled Sunday’s mayhem. “We have seen violence here since January 3, but yesterday terror was let loose,” he said. “A teacher was attacked while cycling on the campus. He ran and informed participants of a Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association peace march that masked people were beating up everyone. In no time, the attackers were at the Sabarmati T-point, assaulting students and teachers.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73132702,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-518666,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/some-start-leaving-but-vow-to-be-back/articleshow/73130024.cms

Rajkot: A doctor was arrested on Monday for allegedly attacking a trader at Moti Tanki Chowk near Bheelvas Chowk locality in Rajkot on December 30 last year. Along with the doctor, seven of his associates were also arrested.

Police said the accused, identified as Dr Luckyraj Patel, had led his aides to attack Hiren Nathwani with a knife. The police are yet to find out that among the accused who had stabbed Nathwani.

Nathwani told the cops that he had a minor accident with Dr Patel’s car on December 28 near Prem Mandir on Kalawad Road.

Dr Patel had noted Nathwani’s car number, on the basis of which he obtained his address from the internet. Then Dr Patel visited Nathwani’s house in Vaishalinagar locality of Rajkot when the latter was absent. Dr Patel got Nathwani’s cellphone number from his wife and called him, saying that that he knew that he had an accident with his car and fled. Dr Patel asked Nathwani to come to strike a compromise at Moti Tanki Chowk and warned him of dire consequences, if he failed to turn up.

“When Nathwani reached Moti Tanki Chowk, there were seven people who attacked him allegedly at the instruction of Dr Patel. One of the accused allegedly stabbed him in his stomach and chest,” said an official from Pradyumannagar police station.

Those arrested along with Dr Patel were Dr Patel’s cousin Jaideep Patel, Yash Vyas, Arjun Rajput, Meet Vyas, Akash Mesvania, Raj Goswami and Dharmesh Yadav.

Kochi: A 17-year-old girl on Monday suffered serious stab injuries after she was attacked by a youth whom she had turned down at Kakkanad in Ernakulam .

The girl, a resident of Athani in Kakkanad, was stabbed multiple times by the youth while she was returning from her workplace. The girl, admitted to the Ernakulam Government Medical College Hospital, Kalamassery, has undergone emergency surgery and her condition remains critical. The accused, who fled from the crime scene after abandoning his bike, is on the run and the Infopark police have launched a probe to nab him.

According to the police, the incident took place around 5pm at Kuzhukuttimala on Infopark road when the girl was returning home from a day care where she worked as a part-time staff.

Police, quoting the witnesses, said that she was stopped by a bike-borne youth and both of them were seen talking for a few minutes. Suddenly, the youth took a knife and stabbed the girl multiple times on different parts of her body, including chest.

By the time the onlookers rushed to the crime scene, he managed to escape, leaving behind his bike.

“The girl was rushed to the hospital by the nearby residents. Preliminary inquiry suggests that it is a case of crime of passion. We have learned that a youth, a native of Padamugal, was making romantic advances towards the girl but the girl rejected him citing religious reasons. We suspect that this provoked the youth to plan and execute the crime,” said a police officer.

Meanwhile, officials of Government Medical College, Ernakulam, said that she is in a critical condition. “She suffered multiple injuries. She was stabbed on her neck, chest, abdomen and other parts of the body,” an official with the hospital said.

The girl has been pursuing a medical lab-assistant course in the city along with her part-time work. Her parents were separated and she was staying with her mother.

Police have seized the youth’s bike. They will take the girl’s statement after her condition becomes stable. Only after that more details can be confirmed, said police.

Broken doors and shattered glass panes after the violence on the JNU campus on Sunday

KOLKATA: A young PhD scholar from Ballygunge recalled Sunday evening as the scariest time of her life, running away from armed goons, running from room to room, hiding behind closed doors. She remained crammed with 30 others in a room for 10 minutes before taking shelter in another room for three hours till help arrived.

“I never thought I would feel so unsafe on my own university’s campus. I still shiver at the sight of my friends — injured and bleeding. Thirty of us hid in a small room in the hostel with lights turned off as armed goons went on the rampage outside, banging on closed doors and thrashing anyone who came their way,” said the scared scholar, Mehta, who agreed to be identified only by her last name to escape the wrath of the attackers. “My parents are tensed. My mother has fallen sick and my father is calling me up every 30 minutes to check if I am fine,” she added.

Mehta was among the scores of students from Bengal who study at JNU . Like most students — Sabarmati Hostel, the seat of Sunday’s violence — is their preferred place to stay.

Another student of literature — a resident of Dum Dum , who was also on the campus — said she ran for her life with others when they saw armed men and women pelting stones from the rooftops of Periyar boy’s hostel. “The attackers then proceeded to smash window panes and assault the students in the hostel,” she said. “We recognized some of the attackers. They actively support ABVP on the campus. But most of them had their faces covered. We have never faced such brutality here,” she said.

Mousumi Mandal, another PhD scholar from Patuli, said she was not on the campus at the time of the incident, but rushed to the aid of her friends the moment she heard about the attack. “By the time, I reached the campus, cops stood on guard manning all the entry points of the university. We marched from hostel to hostel calling out the students to get out of the rooms as we were there to escort them safely out of the campus,” said Mandal.

Mehta said, after being chased for the second time by armed goons, who had slashed at one of her friends and poured some acid-like liquid on them, she was forced to lock herself at a hostel room for three hours till 10.30pm.

Gourab Ghosh, a JNU student and SFI activist, played a crucial role in sending updates to other students in other hostels and even led them towards the north gate in a show of solidarity. “Police helped ABVP in the attack on students. We needed help. Lots of ABVP goons, with their faces covered, had entered campus with rods. When police asked students to chant ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ at JNU north gate, we decided to identify all those leading the carnage. We managed to gather almost 120 students and march towards the main gate as the first sign of resistance,” Ghosh wrote on his Facebook wall.

Sougata Bhaduri, an English professor at the university and a resident Bagmari in north Kolkata, sustained injuries in the attack. “We were standing near the north gate when armed masked men began assaulting us all of a sudden. I was hit on my back and legs,” Bhaduri said.

HYDERABAD: Even as the National Population Register (NPR) is generating heat across the country, an NPR ‘pretest’ (trial form) was done in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh a few months ago. Senior officials said they did not receive any adverse feedback from the respondents.Three districts each in both states were selected along with 68 districts across India where the exercise was completed along with pretest for Census 2021. According to highly-placed sources, NPR prestesting was done in Nizamabad urban, Warangal urban and Mahbubnagar districts of Telangana and Vizianagaram, Anantapur and Guntur districts in AP.Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi and Muslim organisations have asked CM KCR to stop all NPR activity in the state. Women members of All India Muslim Personal Law Board on Monday appealed to KCR to pass a bill in assembly rejecting NPR and NRC.Sources said nearly 30 lakh people responded to the pretest form that was used to collect data in 74 districts in select states. Details on 21 parameters, especially place of birth of father and mother, last place of residence, along with Aadhaar (optional), PAN, voter ID card, passport, mobile phone number and driving licence numbers, were sought.An official from Nizamabad said the process passed off smoothly. “None of the respondents gave an adverse feedback. When this exercise was taken up in September and October 2019, there was no resistance from citizens. All of them submitted details voluntarily,” he said.Four wards in Nizamabad, seven villages of Veleru mandal in Warangal urban and four villages in Nawabpet mandal of Mahbubnagar were covered. A total of 144 enumerator blocs were identified with each having 120-150 houses. An official said families would be informed much in advance about the visit of an enumerator so that the documents were readily available for verification.In AP, eight villages in Anantapur’s Atmakur mandal, eight villages in Vizianagaram’s Bhogapruam mandal and six municipal wards in Guntur’s Narsaraopet were covered. “It is a myth that lot of documents need to be shown. Disclosing the details is also voluntary,” the official explained.Interestingly, this is not the first time that NPR has been undertaken in Telangana.

AHMEDABAD: The court employees at the city civil and sessions court at Bhadra protested on Monday against the stringent rules they are forced to follow after a court staff, Palak Soni, committed suicide during duty hours by jumping from the 7th floor of court building on Saturday.

While the court staff are planning a protest march to the Gujarat high court chief justice’s bungalow on Tuesday, the All India Subordinate Court Staff Association has written a letter to Chief Justice Vikram Nath demanding a “proper judicial and neutral inquiry into the matter by constituting a separate committee”.

The association has pointed out that the employees at the city civil court believe that the workload and mental harassment forced Soni to take the drastic step. It has pointed out 18 rules framed by the principal judge for court employees like prohibition on use of mobile phone, not talking to colleagues, restriction on their movement during office hours etc. Any slip in observing these results in issuance of notices, stoppage of salary, and departmental inquiries against employees etc. The association claimed that these rules add to the agony of court employees at the Bhadra court complex.

The association said that such rules are against provisions contained in service manual or court manual.’The association has also urged the chief justice to act promptly to arrest the spread of discontent among employees of other courts across the state.

454,['7/01/2020'],Delhi assembly election: ‘Office of profit’ case against AAP MLAs now infructuous,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Representative image

NEW DELHI: With the announcement of assembly polls in Delhi , the pending petition being re-heard by the Election Commission seeking disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs for having held office of profit as parliamentary secretaries has virtually become infructuous.

The EC had in January 2018 recommended disqualification of all AAP MLA, holding that they had held office of profit as parliamentary secretaries between their appointment on March 13, 2015, and the Delhi High Court quashing the appointments on September 8, 2016.

On March 23, 2018, the HC set aside the disqualification notification issued by the Centre, based on EC’s opinion, on the ground that no oral hearing was given to the AAP MLAs in violation of principles of natural justice. EC subsequently started hearing the plea afresh, as directed by the HC.

During the re-hearing, AAP MLAs sought to cross-examine petitioner Prashant Patel, who had moved the ‘office of profit’ plea before the President, and others. The EC on September 25, 2018, dismissed the AAP MLAs’ application seeking summoning and examination of witnesses and ruled that all documents available on record pertaining to the appointment and tenure of 20 respondent AAP MLAs as parliamentary secretaries “were self-explanatory”.

The AAP MLAs then challenged the order by EC in the Delhi HC. The matter is sub-judice. An EC functionary said the next date of hearing by the HC was January 10.

However, with the polls already announced and the appointment of the AAP MLAs as parliamentary secretaries already set aside by Delhi HC on September 8, 2016, the disqualification proceedings have no meaning and the MLAs will be free to re-contest the upcoming elections.

Other proceedings that will be affected due to Monday’s polling schedule announcement are of former AAP MLAs Anil Bajpai and Devender Sehrawat, who have challenged their disqualification in the HC. The ex-AAP MLAs have challenged their disqualification under the anti-defection law.

As per Section 15(1)(a) of Government of NCT of Delhi Act, 1991, a person is disqualified from being chosen as or being an MLA if he holds an office of profit under the central government or state government other than an office declared by law not to disqualify its holder. “The disqualification ends the moment he gives up the office of profit and he can re-contest the election immediately thereafter,” said an EC functionary.

During the term of the AAP government, four office of petitions were moved against different sets of AAP MLAs. Based on EC’s opinion, three petitions were dismissed — against 27 MLAs for holding posts of chairpersons of Rogi Kalyan Samitis (EC opinion tendered on July 10, 2018), against 11 AAP MLAs for heading district disaster management committees (on August 26, 2019) and against AAP MLA Surender Singh (on September 16, 2019).

BENGALURU: You may soon get a BMTC feeder bus every 5-10 minutes from Mysuru Road, Byappanahalli, Banashankari and Indiranagar Metro stations.BMTC officials said they have decided to come up with nine new Metro feeder routes with 10 dedicated buses running on each. The average route is 9km long.According to BMTC records, the headway — the time between two buses — in 46% of the current routes is more than 15 minutes, which makes it four buses plying on the route every hour. Also, 32% of the current route network has a headway of more than 30 minutes, which is less than two buses per hour.“The aim is to provide public transport users reliable services and help reduce their travel time. It will also provide a single-journey experience and boost public transport ridership,” said a senior BMTC official.“Most Metro stations do not have bus bays. So it is difficult to park and then pick up and drop passengers. BMRCL has promised bus bays in all upcoming stations wherever feasible,” said another official.Metro’s daily ridership is around 4.5 lakh and is expected to touch 5 lakh this year. According to BMRCL, Byappanahalli, Kempegowda Majestic Interchange, Indiranagar, Yelachenahalli, MG Road, Mysuru Road, Mantri Square Sampige Road, Vijayanagar, Trinity and Rajajinagar are the busiest stations.However, BMTC officials said most of its feeder services are suffering loss. Currently, the transport utility operates 155 feeder buses on 30 routes from different Metro stations. However, there are complaints of poor frequency. According to officials, better feeder services have the potential to increase Metro’s ridership by 10%, remove 28,000 cars from roads, reduce parking space and emission levels.Stations like Chikpet, Peenya, Dasarahalli, Ulsoor , Trinity, Cubbon Park, Vidhana Soudha, Sir M Visvesvaraya, Magadi Road, Hosahalli and KR Market don’t have dedicated feeder buses. Some of these stations have regular buses plying from near them.At present, the frequency of feeder buses along the Green Line is more than 10 minutes. The route length of feeder buses along Green Line varies between 6Km and 19Km. On the Purple Line, the frequency is 15-30 minutes. The average route length varies between 10Km and 30Km. The longer the route length, the more time the buses will take to complete the trips, extending passengers wait time.BMTC officials said they are also envisaging a plan to increase its ridership to around 40 lakh now to 73 lakh by 2030. “We need 10,000 more buses and 65 new depots to increase public transport mode share to 41% by 2030,” he adds.Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd is conducting a mobility improvement study to improve the use of public transport in the city. Sources said New Delhi-based Urban Mass Transit Company has been roped in for the purpose.

457,['7/01/2020'],Astronomers join hands to observe dimming Betelgeuse,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Ahmedabad: Betelgeuse, the second brightest star in Orion constellation, has been visibly losing its brightness from October 2019 onwards and this has city-based amateur astronomers excited. The star, located about 700 lightyears away from the Solar system, is one of the closest Red supergiants, which could meet its ultimate fate in a supernova at any time. The world over, the dimming has enthusiasts glued to telescopes due to the event’s implications.

Dhananjay Rawal, a city-based science communicator, said Orion is one of the most recognizable constellations in the night sky. “Betelgeuse is a variable star – meaning its brightness varies greatly over time – but this time it is decreasing steadily. It could mean two things, it could be a temporary phase, or it could lead to a supernova,” he said, adding that Indians know the star as ‘Aardra’.

In human history, only three to four supernovae have been observed with the naked eye, the last in early 17th century. “If the star turns into supernova even in this century, it will be after a very long time and the star has thus gained attention. The red star is visible even today and it’s a great time to observe it – whatever its fate,” said Kuldip Vora, an amateur astronomer who has been watching the star for the past two months. “If it indeed turns into supernova, it will become brighter than the full moon and will be visible even in the day.”

Manoj Pai, president of the Astronomy Club Ahmedabad, said they recently held a viewing of the star for members. “We went to outskirts of the city to get a good view. In terms of our Solar system, if the star is at where the Sun is, it’s circumference would be greater even than Mars’ orbit. It’s an opportunity for us to introduce the enthusiasts to the exciting world of stars,” he said.

Most importantly, such phenomena takes earthlings back to skygazing.

Jaipur: At a time when infants from underprivileged families are dying, the anganwadi centres (AWC), whose job is to monitor the health of pregnant women, lactating mothers and children (up to 5 years), are also turning out to be ineffective.

The state has close to 66,000 AWCs with most of them are running from makeshift or rented places with bare minimum support like transport facilities, medical staff, nutrition supplements, teaching materials and regular meals for children.

The AWCs are the first point of contact for pregnant woman to get registered in order to avail the facilities. “Once the registration is done, it will enable the beneficiary to get the benefits like regular health checkups, examination of blood and urine at each visit or on a monthly basis, along with incentives like Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana and Janani Suraksha Yojana. Those who miss out registration fail to get such incentives making themselves and their child vulnerable to several diseases,” said Chhaya Pancholi of Jan Swasthy Abhiyan, a advocacy group working for right to health.

Padma Rawal, a mother who lost her five-month-old son at JK Lon Hospital in Kota on December 23, has complained to have not received any supplements from AWC. She is a resident of Chattarpura in Kota and was registered by the AWC which runs in a rented 10x8-sq-feet room. “They have never called for the monthly check-up and food items which I was told was never received,” said Rawal.

Her son was born healthy in a dispensary and fell ill to pneumonia in his fifth month. The anganwadis are also supposed to deliver nutrition supplements (take away ration) to pregnant women and hot cooked meals to children.

Other provisions of the AWCs are once in a month on a fixed day, Maternal Child Health and Nutrition Day has to be observed at the centre. It is to be organised jointly by the health and the ICDS department. “On the given day, immunisation of children is carried out and ANC (ante-natal care) checkups are done of pregnant women. Every pregnant woman should ideally receive 4 ANCs during the course of her pregnancy. Each ANC consists of abdomen examination, blood test, weight and BP test, together with receiving iron folic acid tablets and two TT shots,” said Pancholi.

Consecutive governments have failed to address the problem of streamlining the AWCs. The NFHS-4 report said in Rajasthan only 38.5% pregnant women get 4 ANC checkups and only about 17.3% pregnant women receive 100 or more iron folic acid tablets. Along with 46.6% of the pregnant women are anaemic in the state, 27% of the women within reproductive age have BMIs below normal.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Continuing its upward rally, the price of gold touched another record high on Monday, breaching the Rs 42,000-mark, on account of global factors. The price of the yellow metal stood at Rs 42,300 per 10 gram on Monday in the Ahmedabad market, increasing by Rs 1,000 against the closing price on Friday. Analysts said that escalating tensions between Iran and the US was a major trigger for rise in gold prices.

“As tensions between Iran and the US escalated, global rates of gold rallied. In the international market, gold rose from $1,448 per ounce to $1,525. Moreover, the Indian currency depreciated too against the US dollar. As a result, gold prices saw a sharp rise in the Indian market on Monday,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).

Gold prices already showed a steep rise on Friday, when prices rose by Rs 900 in a day. Overall, gold prices showed an increase of Rs 1,800 in two days. Jewellers indicate that rising gold prices will only dent demand for gold.

“The wedding season is ongoing and the demand for gold will remain. However, nobody can afford to buy gold at this price and thus the proportion of purchases made through exchange of old gold will significantly go up. As a result, overall demand for the yellow metal will remain low-key,” said a city-based jeweller.

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: Cash and other valuables worth Rs 1.20 crore were returned to the complainants at a police function on Monday.

The programme was part of a series of events organised as part of the Maharashtra Police Raising Day celebration from January 2 to January 8. Jewellery worth Rs 37 lakh, vehicles worth Rs 25 lakh, cellphones worth Rs 2.32 lakh and other articles worth Rs 54.69 lakh were returned to the complainants.

Speaking at the function, police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil said the department was making all efforts to see that people coming to the police stations with their problems or complaints are dealt with empathy. To serve this purpose, a call is made from the police control room to every complainant asking about their experience of visiting the police station.

“People are in immense pain when they come to the police station to lodge their complaints. The aim of the police is to deal with such people with empathy and if swift action is needed, the police take it immediately,” he said.

He said that the police control room number now has eight lines, instead of two earlier lines. The police were taking all efforts to ensure that their response time was minimum and no time is wasted in nabbing the culprit. He also lauded the work of police officials in cracking some very challenging cases.

Underlining the need for citizens and private establishments to take their own security measures, Nangare-Patil said residents should appoint security guards and financial institutes must have proper security guards and CCTVs at the ATMs.

“If the financial institutes fail to take up the suggested security measures, the police would be forced to lodge complaints against them,” he said.

461,['7/01/2020'],Rajasthan leopard death count comes down by 17% in 2019,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Representative image

JAIPUR: Leopard mortality has gone down significantly in the state with 17% dip in the number of deaths reported in 2019 compared to the previous year. Leopard is listed on a par with tigers under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972.

According to the data provided by the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), 45 leopards died in 2019, nine less than the 2018 figure.

Rajasthan ranked fourth in leopard deaths in the country in 2019. Maharashtra topped the list with 94 followed by Uttarakhand (79) and Madhya Pradesh (54).

Although, the number of deaths has reduced, a big concern remains that half of these are said to be unnatural—caused by road accidents, electrocution or due to man-animal conflicts.

Tito Joseph, programme manager of WPSI told TOI, “Ten leopards were killed in road accidents and two in rail accidents. The state government should propose mitigation measures to address these issues.”

Conservationists also feel that depletion of natural prey base in most of the forest areas and reserves has led to shifting of the wild animals towards killing of livestock.

As leopards are highly adaptable, they venture close to human settlements whenever there is shortage of food. This is a risk for the big cats as well, since they often become victims of man-animal conflict.

Shatrunjay Singh, who is working for leopard conservation at Jawai Bandh Leopard Conservation Reserve (JBLCR) said, “Fortunately, leopard population has also increased in the state, though the issue remains that they frequently kill livestock. To avoid man-animal conflict, the government should expedite disbursing compensation for livestock killed by wild animals.”

Rajasthan became the first in the world when the state announced leopard reserves under Project Leopard. The initiative started in 2018 with the inauguration of the ‘Leopard Reserve’ at Jhalana forest. The project is being implemented in a phase-wise manner. Proposal of seven more leopard projects in the state including Kumbhalgarh, Jaisamnad, Shergarh, Mount Abu, Khetri, Jawai Baandh Conservation Reserve and Bassi are under consideration.

A new PIL was filed on Monday seeking court directions to the government for strict implementation of the prohibition law in dry Gujarat

AHMEDABAD: While the Gujarat high court is hearing half a dozen petitions demanding relaxation in liquor laws, a new PIL was filed on Monday seeking court directions to the government for strict implementation of the prohibition law in dry Gujarat.Petitioner Prakash Kapadia has in particular taken objection to the recent instructions issued by the state director general of police (DGP) for removing intra-state and inter-state checkposts, which were seen hurdles for bootleggers. The petitioner has questioned the motive behind shutting down these checkposts with immediate effect.The petitioner has claimed that the reason behind diversion of force from these checkposts to cities to maintain law and order is not satisfactory at all. He further argues that such a decision of abolishing checkposts raises concerns whether it would lead to giving bootleggers free entry to the state.The petitioner has questioned closure of all checkposts on state and district borders and sought quashing of this decision. In support of his demand, Kapadia has argued that Gujarat is a dry state, but more than 1,000 persons were caught drunk in Valsad district on the New Year’s Eve.The petitioner further argued that such a closure of checkposts on state borders will result in free flow of liquor in the state, which is in violation of the Gujrat Prohibition Act.The data revealed that liquor worth over Rs 100 crore was caught from the Ratanpur checkpost on Gujarat-Rajasthan border, and nearly 200 breweries were caught in two zones of Ahmedabad police commissionerate.The PIL cited figures placed by the state government before the assembly during the winter session and argued that 13 IMFL bottles are caught every minute in Gujarat, and one bottle of IMFL is caught every minute in Ahmedabad.This PIL is likely to come up for hearing later this week.The high court on Monday adjourned hearing till January 27 on petitions seeking relaxation in prohibition laws so that people can drink at private places. There is one PIL and four special civil applications for relaxing strict liquor ban. Objecting to these petitions, the state government claimed that the practice of drinking will deteriorate the condition of the poor and of women.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73132196,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-103442,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pil-seeks-prohibitive-pressure/articleshow/73130036.cms
463,['7/01/2020'],"Dilapidated BHEL quarters, a den of criminal activities","This story is from January 7, 2020

Bhopal: The gangrape of a minor in broad daylight on Saturday at an abandoned quarter in Berkhera has once again brought to focus safety and security issues at the dilapidated quarters in BHEL township. These abandoned houses have become safe hideouts from miscreants and criminals.

These houses are frequented by criminals who use them as safe hideouts after committing crimes in the city.

Constructed almost 50-55 years ago, the BHEL quarters were full of hustle bustle and were occupied by workers. Gradually, these houses were abandoned after workers and executives retired and moved out of the township. The staff strength in BHEL going down to 6500 from 17,000 added to the problem. Presently, only about 3,500 of the 6,300 quarters are occupied.

Soon after the incident, a blame game has started with the district police saying that they have sent many letters to BHEL management in the past asking them to either demolish the abandoned quarters or take up responsibility of security arrangements in the township. BHEL has said they have contracted private security agency for security in the township and will take necessary action.

Once the quarters were abandoned, many slums have come up close to them. These slums are mostly occupied by contract labourers who are employed in BHEL. Miscreants often use the abandoned houses for gambling, consuming liquor and other criminal activities.

In many burglary and theft gangs busted by police, it was revealed that the accused used these quarters to hide their robbed booty.

Township residents said streetlights are also not functional in the locality which makes life miserable for those still residing here. “Come at night. Then you would realise the condition we are living in. Just imagine, what a single family staying among 50 dilapidated houses undergoes daily,” said a worker pleading anonymity.

Residents alleged that in the absence of proper maintenance and security, several crimes took place in the area. In 2013, businessman Manish Takhtani was murdered and his body was dumped in the abandoned quarters in Govindpura area and set on fire. Several incidents of loot and other crimes have also taken place there. The township is covered by two police stations -- Piplani and Govindpura.

Speaking to TOI, DIG Irshad Wali said the abandoned BHEL quarters have been a problem for police for long. In many cases in the past it was found that criminals use these quarters to hide from police and store their robbed goods. Police have written several letters to BHEL management in the past and asked them either to demolish these structures or own up the responsibility of security in the area.

He said that police conduct regular patrolling in the BHEL township and it will be further intensified.

When contacted PRO BHEL Raghavendra Shukla expressed ignorance about the gangrape case. He said that BHEL management will take cognizance in the matter and take required action. Shukla said that BHEL already have contracted private security agency which keeps a vigil and provides security in the township area. The management will inquire into the matter, he said.

Hyderabad: The number of swine flu cases in the state has risen. In the last fortnight, 43 cases have been reported, with many of these being from Hyderabad. Experts say that the number of cases may surge further in January, and an alert has been sent to hospitals to be prepared for the same.

“While all district and area hospitals have been alerted on the possibility of swine flu cases increasing, currently cases are mostly being reported from private hospitals in and around the city. We have been expecting a surge in cases mostly in the month of January. As of now, out of 100 samples, less than 7% have turned out to be positive for the H1N1 virus,” said a senior official from the state health department.

Since the beginning of November, when swine flu cases usually begin to rise, hospitals have already been alerted thrice to prepare isolation wards. However, this year, the rise in cases has begun late, with most cases being reported over the last fortnight. Usually the H1N1 virus become more active with a decrease in temperature, with the common symptoms being cough, cold, fever, body pain and breathlessness. Patients having cough or sore throat with high grade fever are in the high-risk category, which includes pregnant women, children, elderly and those with comorbid conditions.

“Such patients should be immediately shifted to Gandhi Hospital and paediatric cases should be shifted to Niloufer Hospital, where adequately trained teams, other requisite equipment and treatment facilities are ready,” stated a recent advisory.

Rajkot: A total of 6 ,586 bottles of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and 5,064 cans of beer worth Rs 20 lakh were seized in Olak village of Lakhtar taluka in Surendranagar district on Sunday night.

Police said the seizure was effected when the bootleggers were busy dividing their share of liquor bottles and beer cans.

“We had received a prior information about the bootleggers being scheduled to gather in Olak, following which we raided the spot. However, seeing us, the bootleggers abandoned their two SUVs and fled from the spot,” said Deepak Dhol, inspector with Surendranagar local crime branch.

Dhol said that the police investigation revealed that the liquor cache had been ordered by Vasant Vania and his nephew Deepak Vania.

“We have booked the Vania duo for the crime and launched a manhunt for them as well as the other bootleggers whose identities are yet to be ascertained,” added Dhol.

GANDHINAGAR: The state labour and employment department has merged the rural labour commissionerate with the labour commissionerate.

The rural labour commissionerate was established in 1980 following recommendations of the Satem Commission in an attempt to ensure that unorganized agricultural workers get minimum wages as prescribed by the government under the Unorganised Workers' Social Security Act 2008. Offices of the labour officer and assistant labour officer are functioning in 33 districts and in 116 talukas respectively under the Gujarat rural labour commissionerate, Gandhinagar .

“The rural labour commissionerate was established for the benefit of agricultural workers. However, the government of India implemented the Unorganised Workers' Social Security Act 2008, which also covers agricultural workers. In view of the changed scenario, we feel there is no need to have a separate set up of rural labour commissionerate,” said Vipul Mittra, additional chief secretary, labour and employment department.

An official added that since employees of both the rural labour commissionerate and the labour commissionerate belong to a common cadre, there are unlikely to be any cadre-related service issues because of the merger. “This step will also address the issue of recruitment for the Gujarat state social welfare board,” he said.

468,['7/01/2020'],CBSE schedule derails plan for revision classes,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Hyderabad: City schools are struggling to conduct revision classes for class 10-12 students due to shortage of working days this academic year.

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) advanced the board exams by nearly two weeks this year. As per the schedule released by the board, the exams will be held from February 15 this year as against March first-week conducted for the last few years. Not just that, the CBSE had also advanced the practical exams, which started on January 1 and will be held till February 7, cutting down another 15 days of revision period for students.

“For students struggling to cope up, we are calling them at 7:30am, an hour before the classes begin. Apart from this, we have rearranged our classes wherein we conduct only four periods of 90 minutes and focus on the core subjects,” said Simi Nagi, principal of Pallavi Model School, Alwal.

There are many schools which are calling students even on Sundays to conduct revision classes. Especially those who started academic session in June. Whereas, there are few others such as Delhi Public School (DPS), Nacharam, which are using technology to prepare students for the ensuing board exams.

“We are conducting live web-classes from our in-house studios wherein students can learn even by sitting at home. Teachers are available on call for an hour every evening to resolve students’ doubts apart from addressing queries on our internal student-teacher WhatsApp groups,” said Sunitha Rao, principal of DPS, Nacharam.

Adding to the misery were the number of working days that school managements in Telangana lost due to the RTC strike owing to which the state government had extended the Dasara holidays by a week. School managements rue that despite extending the number of holidays, the state government has not extended the SSC exam dates, thereby leaving them with insufficient time to conduct revision classes. As per schedule, the SSC board exams are scheduled to commence from March 19.

“Inconsistency in classes due to extended holidays has jeopardized students learning. Schools are forced to rush syllabus due to shortage of working days and are unable to conduct enough revision classes before commencement of exams,” said S Madhusudan, state general secretary of Telangana Recognised School Managements Association, adding that the government should have considered postponement of exams to March last week for this year.

Managements fear that revision classes and conducting back-to-back pre-board exams in within a tight time schedule may impact confidence and results of students.

Election Commision of India

NEW DELHI: With the Election Commission announcing the dates for the Delhi assembly elections and the model code of conduct coming into effect, several civic and infrastructure projects are likely to be affected. Many projects in the city are nearing completion, but they cannot be inaugurated until the polls are over.

Some of the big PWD projects that will have to wait are Pragati Maidan redevelopment plan and Chandni Chowk redevelopment plan. Development of stack parking lots and guest housing policy will also be hit. “A lot of our projects will now be put on hold,” said a Public works department (PWD) official.

After construction ban, the poll code is likely to delay the Pragati Maidan redevelopment plan further. Work on it was scheduled to be completed by April 2020.

Some of the other projects that may face delay include Chandni Chowk pedestrianisation, redesigning of the nine arterial roads and decongesting city’s 77 problematic intersections and corridors.

The new Wi-Fi and CCTV spots will also not be inaugurated now that the MCC has been imposed, said a Delhi govt official.

Inauguration of five foot overbridges on the outer ring road was to be done in a few days, claim officials. But now, these FOBs cannot be thrown open to the public by Delhi government till February 11 midnight.

At three municipal corporations, work on several parking projects and improvement of roads will also get affected.

North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which had floated tenders for hiring the contractor to construct multilevel car parking lot at Shastri Park and Old Rajendra Nagar, can now issue work order only after February 11. “The parking projects are aimed at decongesting busy areas. But even if the responses to tenders are received by mid of January, we cannot issue work order now,” said a senior north corporation official. Work on improvement of internal roads may also be delayed.

In east Delhi, all five multilevel parking lots at Apsara Border, Preet Vihar (Aditya Arcade), Babarpur Road, Pushta Road and Nand Nagri will see further development only after February. These parking lots aimed to create additional space for 1,100 cars in east Delhi areas. “Work on the parking lots was pursued seriously to streamline traffic movement and management in prominent market places near them. But now, we have to wait for the completion of election process before taking any further decision,” said an EDMC official.

In south corporation, though various projects were given nod in last standing committee or house meeting, approval on important policies such as licensing policy for guesthouses, hotels and project for maintenance of road sweepers and suction machines will be given after elections. “We had finalised the licensing policy but there were certain bylaws which still needed to be verified,” said a senior SDMC official.

The poll code is also likely to affect work on stack parking near Waste to wonder park and progress on 15-20 automated multilevel stack parking facilities at Malviya Nagar, Janakpuri, Okhla and Nizamuddin.

The dumping yard at Chandiroor in Aroor

KOCHI: When the questions about the removal of concrete waste from the four apartment complexes in Maradu becomes a concern as the dates for demolition approaches fast, the debris-removal contractor said that it will not be a problem for residents as there is high-demand for the debris for land-filling and construction of roads. Around 200 loads of pre-demolition debris which were dumped at the yard at Chandiroor in Aroor over the last one month has been used for land-filling at construction sites and roads at various parts of Ernakulam and Alappuzha districts. Sources at Prompt Enterprises, the debris-removal contractor, said that contractors have been approaching them to make advance bookings to buy the debris once the four buildings are demolished.

“The Pollution Control Board has given permission to use the yard for debris dumping and we are already taking measures like sprinkling water and covering the boundary with nets to prevent dust pollution. Now we have only 20 loads of debris here at the yard and the rest have been used for landfill at our construction sites. Also, more than 40 loads have been sold to private contractors. At a time when the scarcity of sand and soil becoming a big challenge for contractors who are engaged in landfilling the construction sites, the debris from the demolished flats will be helpful. So we don’t think the thousands of tonnes of debris post demolition will remain dumped here for long time causing pollution concerns,” said an official of Prompt Enterprises.

At present the debris is dumped at a 2.6acre yard situated at 200 metres from the National Highway in Chandiroor in Aroor panchayat. As the yard will not be sufficient to accommodate the debris post demolition, the contractor has leased out an 8-acre land near Kumbalam toll plaza. They said that concrete waste amounting to around 4000 loads (in large multi-axle trucks) is expected to be removed from the four demolition sites in Maradu. The contractor will also bring in a concrete recycling machine after the demolition to turn the waste into concrete powders which can be used for road laying and construction.

Meanwhile, the Aroor Panchayat officials said that they have not received any intimation about using the land within the panchayat for the debris dumping. “Some of the residents in the locality have raised concern about the pollution aspects. We were not intimated about the decision to dump the waste from Maradu here. We did not give any permission to the contractor too,” said Panchayat president Ratnamma.

472,['7/01/2020'],Joint family membership no basis to claim tenancy right: Bombay high court,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Representative image

PUNE: The Bombay high court has ruled that a person cannot claim an independent right or inheritance of tenancy in a property merely by virtue of being a member of a joint family.

In a civil suit stretching over 38 years in relation to an old wada in Shukrawar Peth, the HC has upheld the Pune district court’s November 1, 1997, ruling, which directed five petitioner/occupants of two ground-floor and four first-floor rooms in the wada to evict the premises in favour of original landlords Yashwant Shankar Barve, his brother, Sadanand, and the latter’s wife, Sulabha — all three since deceased and represented by their legal heirs. The Barves initiated an eviction suit in Pune court on August 12, 1982.

On January 3, the HC bench of Justice G S Kulkarni dismissed the petition, holding that the same was ‘without any merit’ and gave the petitioners — Vasant Sadashiv Joshi and four others — six months to hand over the possession of the suit premises to the legal heirs of the original landlords.

“The petitioner/occupants now have the option of either vacating the premises on their own or move an appeal in the Supreme Court in which case, our clients will take a call on exercising their legal options,” lawyer Drupad Patil, who represented the landlords, told TOI on Monday.

The question dealt by the HC was whether the member of a joint family can claim an independent right or inheritance of tenancy in the suit premises when the tenant holding the rent receipt had himself shifted out of the premises.

The suit premises was taken on tenancy in 1937 by a joint Hindu family headed by Raghunath Joshi, who passed away in 1971. After Raghunath’s death, the rent receipt was transferred in the name of his son, Achyut, who shifted out to a property of his own in 1979. However, Raghunath’s brother, Sadashiv, continued to occupy the premises and after Sadashiv’s death in 1981, his eldest son, Vasant, and four siblings continued the occupation till date.

In their petition against the 1997 Pune court ruling, Vasant and his four siblings claimed, among other things, that the provisions under Section 5 (11) (c) (i) of the Bombay Rent Act recognised that every member of the joint family or the joint family itself becomes a tenant. The HC dismissed such interpretation by observing that the same had no legal foundation as the provisions would attract only when a tenant dies and, in the instant case, tenant Achyut was surviving and has moved out of the suit premises.

The bench also referred to the definition of a ‘tenant’ under the Act and held that recognising the petitioners’ claim would lead to an absurdity. “Firstly, it would amount to reading something into the definition of tenant, which has not been provided for and/or excluded by the legislature. Secondly, it would be contrary to the conduct of the parties who wholeheartedly accepted, chose and elected that the tenant for the suit premises after the death of Raghunath would be Achyut,” the bench said.

After Raghunath’s death and, again, after shifting out of Achyut from the suit premises, neither Sadashiv nor Vasant Joshi made any claim to the tenancy right, the bench said and further observed that recognising the claim would create insurmountable uncertainty for the landlords in pursuing eviction proceedings as every successive member of the family would claiming legal rights and protection under the Bombay Rent Act.

The bench finally held that there was no perversity in the findings as recorded by the (Pune) district judge and, that, the latter had correctly decreed the suit and had dismissed the petitioners’ appeal.

474,['7/01/2020'],Chhindwara tops ‘multiparameter’ ranking of urban cities in Madhya Pradesh,"This story is from January 7, 2020

BHOPAL: Focusing on comprehensive assessment of urban development, the MP government has released its own ranking. In contrast to the Union government rankings, MP urban administration and housing development (UAHD) rankings of municipal corporations has MP CM Kamal Nath’s assembly constituency Chhindwara on top, followed by Burhanpur and Dewas . Bhopal is rank of eighth and Indore is eleventh. The rankings, which assess cities on six broad parameters, were released on Sunday.

“The rankings are to basically get a balanced view on urban development. Currently, the focus has been only on Swachh rankings. Our methodology is also to include other programmes of urban development,” said MP UAHD principal secretary, Sanjay Dubey.

Interestingly, Gwalior and Jabalpur divisions are at the bottom of the rankings, similar to overall rankings of the Union government. MP urban development minister Jaivarshan Singh’s assembly constituency is in Gwalior division.

Drawing focus and evaluating performance of municipal commissioners, the MP UAHD has tagged multiple parameters besides weightage to Swachh Bharat only. Compared to the MP UAHD ranking, the Union government's Swachh ranking has Indore as the cleanest city in India and Bhopal as cleanest capital city. The two cities are also among the most liveable, going by the Union government’s ease of living index.

The MP UAHD ranking is based on assessment of wider criteria, including cleanliness, implementation of project under AMRUT, housing development and urban livelihoods mission and smart city development. Chhindwara scored 77.52 out of 100 points. Burhanpur from a non-ODF city, in November got an ODF++ certification, scored 70.44, ahead of Dewas which got 69.40 points.

“Burhanpur has improved on various accounts of project development. A comprehensive sewage networking project is underway along projects funded under AMRUT,” said Burhanpur municipal commissioner, Bhagwandas Bhumarkar. Similarly, focused development of Chhindwara has meant that tax collection efficiency of the corporation has improved, along with implementation of various urban development projects.

Interestingly, none of the top three cities are part of the Union government’s smart cities' mission. MP, as a state, has the most number of smart cities in India. The top performing city with smart cities' tag, was Ujjain with a score of 66.89 and is ranked fourth. Bhopal, at rank 8, got 62.35 points. It scored the least number of points on implementation of housing schemes, including Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and CM housing mission. Overall, Bhopal performed well on smart city implementation, with Indore still taking the top slot in Swachh Bharat Mission. However, Indore’s tax collection efficiency was rated as the worst.

AHMEDABAD: To evaluate the behaviour of police personnel while dealing with common people, Kutch West Police have installed machines called Public Response Tracking Information by Help of Assessment by Visitors (Pratibhav). The machines have been installed at the Bhuj city police station and B division police station in the pilot project.

SP West Kutch, Saurabh Tolambiya, said this is the first-of-its-kind project in the state. An official said that the machine has four buttons. “The first is the start button. The other buttons are Good (Uttam), Average, and Poor,” the official said. “People’s feedback will directly reach the SP’s office and the control room.”

Tolambiya said that over the past three days, police have received 75 submissions. Of these, 59 have been Uttam, 15 average, and 1 poor.

“We have taken care that cops themselves do not press the Uttam button,” Tolambiya said. “We have installed CCTV cameras on the machines in such a way that the back of a person is seen but not the response.”

Tolambiya said that the responses will be used to take corrective measures and to ensure that common people who visit police stations are treated well. Tolambiya said it is important that trust is developed between police and people.

476,['7/01/2020'],JNU violence: Indian Medical Association condemns violence against doctors,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Representative image

NEW DELHI: The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has issued a statement condemning the “mindless violence on doctors and nurses who rushed to treat injured in JNU”. This is the third such statement coming from IMA headquarters in the capital blaming the state and law enforcers.

Last month, the IMA had issued a statement that all violence is unacceptable, especially those perpetrated by the state on people who require medical attention.

“The situation in the country smacks of total anarchy and breakdown of law and order is complete. If doctors and nurses are not safe in the capital of the country, it speaks volumes about the governance or lack of it,” the statement issued on Monday by IMA national president Dr Rajan Sharma and secretary general Dr RV Asokan read.

“How does it reflect on the nation if it cannot protect its doctors and nurses reaching out to the injured? Is this a civil war? What is the message that goes out to the world?” asked the medical body.

IMA reiterated its stand that doctors and nurses have the right of way to treat the injured and that everyone had the right to life and access to care. The IMA headquarters directed its Delhi state branch to react strongly and take appropriate action.

In an earlier statement issued on December 22 last year, IMA referred to police storming into a hospital in Karnataka’s Mangaluru. “This is a new low in the civic life of the nation but not entirely unexpected given the impunity with which violence is heaped on doctors and hospitals. However, the difference this time is that it is the establishment which has lost its restraint,” said the IMA, adding that no violence was acceptable in a hospital as “hospitals are sacrosanct and are exempted even in a war zone”.

The government and its establishment have no right to deny anyone their right to access, said the statement adding that it stood for retaining hospitals as safe zones. It went on to state that Indian doctors would never let down anyone who required care and that no politics could dilute this resolve of the IMA.

Dr Asokan has also written a piece titled New Truth on the IMA national general secretary’s page, in which he states: “Whatever may be the New Truth, medical profession and the values by which it survives stand still in Time. The patient is just another human being. S/he does not have another identity ….The colour, creed and ideology of the patient is immaterial. Hospital is an institution which reflects and radiates this core value. Any temporal authority is constrained by this Lakshman Rekha.”

Aurangabad: Members of the Prahar Apang Kranti Andolan launched an agitation in front of the civic administration on Monday and and warned of continuing their protest till chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s visit to the city on Thursday until the AMC fulfilled the demands of the people with disabilities (PwDs).

The district unit of Prahar Apang Kranti Andolan submitted a memorandum to the municipal commissioner stating that most PwDs registered in the city had not been paid their honorarium from the funds reserved for disabled people. The activists of the outfit have held several agitations in the past, after which the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) started releasing the honorarium to the PwDs.

District chief of Prahar Apang Kranti Andolan, Shivaji Gade, said that the agitation would not be withdrawn until and unless the money was deposited in the accounts of PwDs. The state government mandates local bodies to reserve 5% of their total budget for the welfare and rehabilitation of PwDs.

According to mayor Nandkumar Ghodele, there are 2,107 PwDs in the city registered with the AMC. The honorarium for 468 PwDs has been released and the process of releasing the payment for another 650 of them was underway. “The civic body is cash-strapped and is unable to release the payment for all PwDs. Many of the disabled people registered with the AMC are from the talukas, they are not our responsibility. ,” said Ghodele.

Aurangabad: The civic administration will push for the establishment of the Babasaheb Thackeray memorial and the implemention of the water supply project among other key issues during CM Uddhav Thackeray’s visit to the city scheduled for later this week.

Mayor and Sena corporator Nandkumar Ghodele said on Monday that Thackeray would lend an ear to the issues plaguing the city in his capacity as the state CM for the first time. “Presentations on various projects funded by the government like the Rs 100 crore road project, underground drainage project, conservation of nine historic gates, Smart City and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana will be given to the CM,” said Ghodele.

The CM, along with cabinet ministers Eknath Shinde and Subhash Desai, will attend a meeting at the Government guest house at 3.45pm on Thursday.

“We have five key demands that we will present before the CM—establishment of the Balasaheb Thackeray memorial, implementation of the Rs 1,680 crore-water supply scheme on priority basis, approval for the Rs 267 crore-road project, installation of the raised statue of Shivaji Maharaj at Kranti Chowk and renovation of Sant Eknath Rangmandir,” said Ghodele. The civic body will be needing funds from the state government for all these projects.

Reservation matrix (for SCs, STs, BCs and women) for municipalities and municipal corporations, including Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), in the state were announced on Sunday. The reservation matrix will be in place for two terms.

Elections for 120 municipalities and 10 municipal corporations will be held on January 22.

This is the first time GHMC mayor post has been reserved for women after the formation of Telangana. Earlier, two women had served as mayors in the city. Sarojini Pulla Reddy of Congress was the first woman mayor of Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad in 1965, while Banda Karthika Reddy, also of Congress, was the first woman mayor of GHMC (2009) in the undivided AP.

GHMC mayor’s seat, which is presently reserved for BCs and held by B Rammohan of TRS, has been reserved for a woman from open category (OC) in the draw of lots held on Sunday to fix the quota for women in 123 municipalities and 13 municipal corporations.

Municipal administration director TK Sridevi announced names of wards, divisions, chairpersons and mayor posts reserved for SCs, STs, BCs and women and said the quota would be in place for two terms. While SC and ST quota was finalised in proportion to their population, BC reservations were fixed on the basis of voter numbers. Women seats were reserved through draw of lots.

Sridevi said BCs got between 30-33% reservations in municipalities and municipal corporations after SC and ST quota was fixed. “We ensured the SC-fixed cap of not exceeding over all reservation beyond 50% was complied with,” Sridevi said.

The government finalised reservations for all mayor posts despite polls not being conducted in GHMC, Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation and Khammam Municipal Corporation. For municipal chairpersons’ posts in 123 municipalities, the officials reserved four seats for STs, 17 for SCs, 40 for BCs and 62 for general. About 50% posts have been reserved for women in the exercise done on the basis of the 2011 Census data.

483,['7/01/2020'],Flyers fume over 14-hour delay of GoAir flight to Kolkata,"This story is from January 7, 2020

Passengers stranded on the tarmac in Bhubaneswar airport.

PUNE: As many as 162 passengers of a GoAir flight to Kolkata, slated to take off from the Lohegaon airport at 10.25pm on Sunday, went through over a 16-hour-long ordeal because of rescheduling after the boarding was completed and diversion to Bhubaneswar due to poor visibility in Bengal capital.

Worse, the flyers were made to sit in the aircraft for an hour in Bhubaneswar. They spent two more hours on the tarmac before being taken to the terminal building there.

The flight (G8 394) was slated to take off from Pune at 10.25pm on Sunday and land in Kolkata at 12.50am on Monday. It finally reached the destination around 2.50pm on Monday — a delay of 14 hours.

A GoAir spokesperson said, “GoAir flight G8 394 from Pune to Kolkata was diverted to Bhubaneswar because of bad weather in Kolkata. The flight landed safely with 162 passengers on-board in Bhubaneswar. All passengers were deplaned, transferred to the terminal building and offered refreshments during the delay. However, this was aggravated with Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) of the crew, which led to a further delay in departure from Bhubaneswar. GoAir sincerely regrets any inconvenience caused to its passengers.”

Debjani Chatterjee, one of the flyers, told TOI, “We boarded the plane on time in Pune and remained seated in the aircraft for around half-an-hour. At 11pm, we were told to de-board. We went back to the terminal building. After a while, we were told that the flight had been delayed and would depart at 1.30am.”

The flight did finally take off at 1.30am for Kolkata, but more hassles were in store for the flyers.

“When we were about to reach the destination, there was an announcement from the deck that the flight could not land at Kolkata because of poor visibility. The flight then landed in Bhubaneswar at 4.40am. It seemed the cabin crew and other officials of the airline had no clue as to what was going on and we remained seated in the aircraft for an hour after landing in Bhubaneswar.”

Chatterjee said a woman flyer’s relative was in a serious condition in Kolkata. “While we were waiting, she got information over the phone that her relative had passed away. She pleaded with the airline staffers to do something as she had to reach Kolkata, but they could not help her,” Chatterjee said.

After an hour, the aircraft’s doors were opened and the passengers de-boarded.

Chatterjee said the passengers were then left stranded on the tarmac for around two hours. “At one point, I heard someone saying there was a snag in the aircraft. Then someone said the diversion had happened because of low fuel. No refreshments were served to the passengers. At 7.30am, the airline’s staffers told passengers to go to the terminal building. We were told that the plane will take off around 11.30am on Monday after a fresh set of crew arrived,” she said.

The plane got delayed further. “It finally took off at 1.30pm on Monday and landed in Kolkata around 2.50pm.

Chandan Mondal, another passenger, tweeted, “My grandma expired. Flight delayed more than 12 hours. Many travelling for exam, someone for medical emergency. Why Indian government doesn’t have solutions to handle any emergency?”

CM Pinarayi Vijayan

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan compared Sunday’s riot on JNU campus to a ‘Nazi-style attack’ intended to create an atmosphere of fear in India. “Sangh Parivar should end this diabolical plan to silence universities with bloodshed,” he said. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the JNU attack exposed the extent of fascism threat in the country.

AISF, CPI’s student union, has called for a statewide strike by boycotting classes on Tuesday, in solidarity with students of JNU.

Vijayan while condemning the JNU attacks said the attack on the students and faculty of JNU is an appalling display of intolerance running amok. The attackers intend to create an atmosphere of unrest and terror in the country.

“The scale of the attack reveals the extent of planning that went into it. Sangh Parivar must end this diabolical plan to silence universities with bloodshed. Remember, those students are speaking for all,” he said.

Chennithala said the Sangh Parivar should not be under the impression that those who are opposing them could be suppressed using brutal attacks. “The people of this country would come out in open in large numbers to protest against their high-handedness,” he added.

“Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah are providing silent support to the perpetrators of crime. Two girls had protested against the house-to-house campaign carried out by Shah in New Delhi. This should be seen as the provocation behind the attack against the JNU students,” said Chennithala.

While condemning the attack on the teachers and students of the most prestigious university of the country, Chennithala said it shows the intolerance of BJP and Sangh Parivar against the protests coming out from an institution which has churned out many eminent personalities including Nobel laureates.

Former KPCC president V M Sudheeran said the police remained mute spectators when the attack was carried out against the students, which shows the silent support of the administration for the attack. “The police in New Delhi is directly under the control of Shah and hence he cannot run away from the responsibility of the attack,” said Sudheeran.

TimesView Why does the civic body need a push from the government to implement its own policy? As the authorities continue to drag their feet on the issue, the wide ‘smart’ footpaths and the cycle tracks on them have become parking havens in the city. A major part of the Balgandharva bridge is blocked by parked cars. Even the Z bridge has not been spared. Private bus operators are seen finding new spots to park their vehicles illegally. It is time to implement the parking rules in letter and spirit.

PUNE: The state government has directed the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to implement the parking policy, which was passed by its general body in March last year.The direction follows non-governmental organisation (NGO) Parisar writing to the then Devendra Fadnavis-led government in the state in August last year, insisting on the policy implementation in the city.Through a letter, the urban development department of the state government directed PMC to implement the parking policy in September last year. The letter stated, “The policy must be implemented at the level of the PMC immediately.”The NGO received a copy of the letter on December 31 last year. Parisar representatives said the Union government made the parking policy implementation one of the pre-conditions for the approval of the Pune Metro .Parisar founder Sujit Patwardhan said the issue was raised with the previous mayor and municipal commissioner on several occasions, but to no avail. Parisar’s Ranjit Gadgil said, “The power to decide about the parking charges on city roads rests completely with the municipal commissioner as per the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act. As per section 243A of the Act, the general body has the power to approve the parking fees.”When contacted, mayor Murlidhar Mohol said the policy would come into force soon. “It has been decided by PMC to identify some major roads in the city where pay and park will be implemented first. Subsequently, it will be enforced in other parts of the city,” he said.Traffic expert Pranjali Deshpande, who worked on the policy, said fees were an effective way of not only reducing private vehicle use but also ensuring that available parking spaces were efficiently used.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73133778,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-437904,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-directs-pmc-to-enforce-parking-policy-without-delay/articleshow/73129253.cms

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: Worried about their girls giving up studies because the daily 10km walk to college had become unbearable, these villagers from Nashik district decided to step in.

Nearly 211 girls from Vadner Bhairav, a village located off the Nashik–Mumbai highway in Chandwad taluka, attend colleges located at least four kilometres away. Villagers and college authorities noticed that almost 50% of these girls don’t attend college regularly as they cannot afford the Rs 2,000 annual fees for the college bus service.

They decided to give the girls’ education a push. In a general body meeting of the village in December 2019, it was decided that the women and child welfare committee would bear the transport cost of these 211 girls, effective from this month. Moreover, the panel will fund the college travel — be it the larger town of Pimpalgaon or even Nashik, about 45km away — of all girls in the village for the next five years.

“None of the girls studying in colleges — even as far as Nashik city — will have to worry about the transportation cost. The women and child welfare committee of the village has decided to foot the bill. The decision will be applicable for the next five years,” Raosaheb Gaikwad, deputy sarpanch of the village, said.

The 28,000 residents of the village decided to come together so that their girls do not drop out. The village local governing body has revenue collection of Rs 60 lakh. The 17-member of body of the village has nine women members, and it adopted the resolution for financing the transportation.

“There are many girls, who have left their colleges, and limited themselves to farming and other activities largely because they cannot afford the travel expenses for studies. We, therefore, decided to make the things easier for them,” Gaikwad said.

The college, run by Maratha Vidya Prasarak Samaj, has started a bus on no-profit, no-loss basis exclusively for the girls. The vehicle is equipped with the global positioning system and closed circuit television cameras. The annual fee of the bus is Rs 2,000 for every student.

Vaishali Patil, who attends college now, couldn’t suppress her excitement. “This initiative will encourage girls to study more and be capable of steering their own career in various fields. We hope this initiative will continue and not face any opposition.”

Roshan Suryawanshi, the village development officer, said they had noticed that 103 girls would skip classes for the sole reason that they are unable to walk 10 km daily to and from the college. “Many other girls quit college because of the same reason. The women and child welfare body then decided to take up the responsibility of bearing the cost of their college travel,” he said.

He added that they have already presented the cheque for the travel cost of all the 211 girls from their village to the college authorities. “We chose the bus service because it has safety features and the college will take the other responsibilities as well,” Suryawanshi said.

The village has also adopted the resolution of providing the monthly pass for all the girls taking lessons in Pimpalgaon or Nashik city. The cost of the pass of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus will be borne by the village. In order to ensure the funding does not stop, the budgetary allocation has been made.

Thiruvananthapuram: Citing the dismissal of 166 employees, including the secretary of Muthoot Finance Employees Union, employees of Muthoot Finance have launched another indefinite strike .

According to MP Elamaram Kareem, CITU state secretary, the management had terminated 166 employees and closed 43 branches as a retaliatory action against the 52-day strike organized by the union members in August and September, last year. “The management identified union members, including the secretary, and the branches in which they worked. They have decided to close only those branches. This is a clear violation of the prior agreement and amounts to contempt of court,” said Kareem in a news conference on Saturday.

MFEU is a part of Non Banking and Private Finance Association , which is organising the strike in front of the head office of Muthoot Finance in Kochi. Employees from all the 564 branches of Muthoot are participating in the indefinite strike in support of the dismissed employees.

Kareem said Muthoot management does not have an employee-friendly attitude and they have constantly tried to dismantle the union. “In August, the employees began a strike demanding minimum wages for the employees of non-banking sector. The management did not pay any heed to the needs of the employees. They sent officers who did not have any power to make any decision in the dispute settlement and compromise meetings. They are blinded by the arrogance of their wealth,” said Kareem.

He also said the termination of 166 employees was a direct violation of the tripartite agreement reached upon on October 10, last year.

“The management had assured that they will not take any action against the employees who took part in the strike. The memorandum, which recorded the conditions of compromise, clearly states all these conditions. These employees have been dismissed without any reason,” he added.

Around 3,000 Muthoot employees were on strike from August 20, last year, he said, adding: “It is actually a shame that a company, which boasts about their large gold reserves and a profit of Rs 2,106 crore, is not paying minimum wages to their own employees who made these achievements possible.”

Former MLA V Sivankutty alleged that a few former IPS officers were trying to interfere in this strike.

“Some former IPS officers are now working as security counsellors for Muthoot. They are free to do any job they desire. But I don’t understand why they are trying to interfere in these matters,” said Sivankutty.

494,['7/01/2020'],Whip on power theft adds Rs 1 cr to MSEDCL kitty,"This story is from January 7, 2020

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: The year-long action against power thefts in Nashik circle had borne fruit, added over Rs one crore to the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited ( MSEDCL ) revenue collection.

Pravin Daroli, superintendent engineer of Nashik, had launched a special drive against power theft on January 6, 2019. Till December 31, 2019, the office had detected 246 thefts with the assessment of Rs 86.95 lakh. Taking into account the compounding amount of Rs 14.19 lakh, the total collection through the action was Rs 1.07 core. These cases of thefts do not include the ones carried out by the flying squads of the MSEDCL.

MSEDCL official said the assessment is the amount charged by electricity company for the power thefts, while the compounding amount is the one that is paid to the government (by the accused). The compounding cost is paid only for the first case of power theft by a person, considering that it may be an error. In case of repeat offence, an First Information Report (FIR) is filed.

“I had planned to carry out the drive against power thefts at my level. Hence, I took the support of the officials ans used IT to zero in on the power thefts,” Daroli said.

The team swung into action from the first month of 2019 and set target for themselves. The teams analysed the data of the bills of consumers from all subdivisions to identify those with irregular power consumption.

“Our first factor was irregular consumption – it could be due to failure of the meter or because of tampering and there was no third reason. Once those were listed, a soft enquiry was carried out to figure out if the consumer was staying here regularly or not,” the officer said.

The officer pointed out that most of the cases were related to slow meters, which were running from 30% to 80% of the capacity. The other instances of thefts had some other reasons.

About 11 cases were such that the consumers used a remote slow down the units of the meter, while there were at least 15 consumers who bypassed the meters to ensure power consumption was not recorded. There were also the consumers whose power connections were permanently disconnected, but they were still drawing power – either directly from overhead lines or clandestinely from the nearest distribution point.

PUNE: Two persons were detained on Monday night for questioning in connection with the murder of a footwear shop owner after the city police studied CCTV footage and technical data to obtain vital clues about the assailants.

Police refused to disclose information about the duo and their link, if any, to the crime.

The victim, Chandan Krupadas Shewani (48) of Sadhu Vaswani Chowk, was found shot dead at Padegaon village near Lonand in Satara district on Sunday morning. His shop was on Laxmi road. The post-mortem report revealed he suffered two bullet injuries.

The police said the people who kidnapped Shewani late on Saturday night killed him for some reason without waiting for ransom. “We have arrived at the conclusion that the note stating ‘Rs2 crore nahi diya iske liye gaya, bhai ke order pe thokna pada’ (He did not give us Rs2 crore, hence, we had to eliminate him on boss’ order) was kept near Shewani’s body to mislead the police probe,” a senior officer said.

DCP (Zone II) Shirish Sardeshpande said the probe was heading to the right direction and the police had obtained many clues in the case.

The crime branch and the Bund Garden police teams collected CCTV footage from various locations of Laxmi Road, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Road and Maldhakka Chowk. “Our teams are still studying the footage and we shall definitely find clues from them,” the senior officer said.

Shewani was a bachelor. He stayed with his parents and sister at Sadhu Vaswani Chowk.

He had left his shop “Shiv Kailas Shoes” around 10pm on Saturday for home in his black sedan but did not reach home. His sister, Sangeeta Krupadas Shewani, lodged a missing person’s report with the Bund Garden police in the wee hours of Sunday.

BENGALURU: Amid fears that the state might miss revenue targets for this fiscal due to the economic slowdown, chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday said Karnataka stood second in the country in collection of goods & services tax.

“Till December end, the state collected Rs 61,245 crore through GST (which includes states GST) which is 14.2% more than previous year and the second highest among states,” Yediyurappa said.

He was speaking after chairing a meeting of officials of revenue generating departments — excise, commercial tax, transport, stamps and registration and mines — on Monday as part of preparations for the state budget.

Figures released by the government show that barring transport, the other departments have clocked an average 72% revenue collection of targets. But with just three months remaining for the current fiscal to end, officials fear a sizeable shortfall.

The transport department has mopped up Rs 4,864 crore as against a target of Rs 7,100 crore. “This is mainly because of the fall in vehicle sales,” the CM said. Yediyurappa acknowledged fears of a revenue shortfall, but instructed officials to work harder than ever.

“The focus for the next three months should be on collecting more tax by way of identifying tax evaders and plugging leaks,” he said.
