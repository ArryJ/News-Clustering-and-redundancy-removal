0,['5/01/2020'],Live it up in 2020,"The New Year looks like a mixed bag of traditional wisdom and space-age endeavours; functional fitness and micro regional flavours. All in all, it looks like a year of promise and mindful choices.The world will witness the birth of a completely new travel sector in the 2020s – sub-orbital business aircraft and intergalactic hotels. Going forward, everyday cosmonauts will get to experience total weightlessness and see Earth’s curvature below them. NASA will begin selling passenger tickets to the International Space Station (ISS) for US$ 35,000 a night. Space X or Boeing will be providing flights. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin Space Company hopes to launch crewed test flights of its New Shepard craft in 2020, in preparation for sending its first space tourists.From the introduction of vegan hotels to a plethora of sustainable initiatives like eco-aware hotels that eliminate plastics, introduce ‘give-back’ activities and use local produce and communities in hotels, it has become easier to travel more ethically. According to the Vegan Society, if the whole world went meat-free by 2050, it would save eight million human lives and reduce greenhouse gases by two thirds. Moreover, with the rise in ‘flygskam’ (or ‘flight shaming’) coupled with ‘tagskyrt’ (or ‘train-bragging’) — two Swedish terms which seem to capture the zeitgeist and which are all the rage on social media — conscious travellers are also turning to alternative modes of transport as opposed to flying.From heirloom recipes to nutritional advice, there’s no food better than your grandma’s. Dieticians are encouraging patients to think in terms of what grandma used to eat back then. It’s just a different way to think about how reliant we’ve become on processed food. If we can think about Grandma, or great-Grandma, who made most food from scratch, it can help us get back to a healthier way of eating. In the early 1900s, 80 per cent of individuals lived on family farms where physical activity was part of their livelihood and routine. Whether on farms or in smaller gardens, people grew their own vegetables. That’s what we are going back to.In case our own endorphins weren’t proof enough, evidence is mounting that there are plenty of reasons to exercise which have nothing to do with physical appearance: Cortisol-conscious workouts focused on reducing stress are on the rise, and studies have shown that the mental benefits of exercise can help with mental health issues including anxiety and depression. Mindful workouts and functional fitness will continue to grow bigger in 2020. Maintaining a good body weight will still be an objective but definitely not the topmost priority. Thanks to the Body Positivity movement, attaining a bikini body is no more the goal.You’ve heard of wine and spirit tasting tours and bar crawls during a travel break. This year will be about wine and whiskey residencies where you are booked in a villa and a spirit expert takes you through the appreciation process. Rather than visiting a distillery or a vineyard, expect these residencies to be big this year – here you get to sample a vintage brew or a range of products of a certain year and pair the drinks with different cuisines over a period of two nights and three days.There has been a noticeable rise in groups of friends and family clubbing together to rent holiday villas, chalets and high-end homes with butler services. These quirky as well as beautiful villas come with swimming pools, in-house theatres, gyms as well as a degree of exclusivity, novelty and informality that hotels cannot match. Luxurious home stays offer an ideal setting for bonding and reconnecting with loved ones. Another plus point is that a majority of such villas are pet-friendly and have sufficient space for your furry friends to play around. The concept of weekend getaways to a fancy homestay is only likely to gain more popularity this year.In the New Year, we will get more responsible for our own health, and the health of those for whom we shop and cook. Your health starts at the kitchen table. Homemakers and chefs will be more focused on health, mindful eating, sustainable foods and lifestyles, and fitness. From more calming foods for anxiety, nootropics to boost the brain and plant-based food to cleanse the body, the mantra for 2020 will be ‘food to fuel the mind, body and spirit’.Regional food will be broken into micro-regions. Language and food changes every 100 km in India. Then how can you have Rajasthani or Awadhi as a broad category? This will be the year of micro-regional cuisines. Chefs will speak of the cuisine of a community, a locality or just a lane than merely stating it’s a regional Indian cuisine. Expect menus to be inspired by the fishermen community in Koliwada, Punjabi food of Uttarakhand’s Sikh community, coastal cuisine of small towns in Kerala or desserts from Madhya Pradesh. If not the cuisine, then there would be micro regional ingredient influences where you can expect a lot of fusion preparations where popular dishes are cooked using spices and herbs from a particular district or farm.Among people hitting health clubs, a new category will be senior citizens and kids. Increasingly, older adults are turning to smartwatches and fitness trackers to monitor everything from heart rate to steps taken. There will be certified trainers specialising in fitness programmes for adults, helping them with recovery, flexibility and knee issues. Similarly, kids will be seen hitting the gym to learn better posture, body movement and alignment.Gyms will be employing sports nutritionists and certified fitness professionals instead of body builders. Exercise will be one of the more prescribed forms of treatment for patients who are experiencing a range of disorders. As a result, physiotherapy will get more popular and people will be encouraged to engage in some form of exercise to maintain good health. This is an aspect that will be seen as essential, even for those not facing any immediate medical conditions.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73070429,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-956169/73070429.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/live-it-up-in-2020/articleshow/73070429.cms
1,['5/01/2020'],Diet to induce sound sleep,"There are four main vitamins and minerals found in food that help in promoting sleep: tryptophan, magnesium, calcium, and B6. Some of these substances help the body produce melatonin, the hormone that is responsible for regulating your circadian rhythm (sleep/wake patterns). Magnesium is a powerful mineral that is instrumental in sleep and is a natural relaxant that helps deactivate adrenaline. In fact, it is often referred to as the sleep mineral. Calcium is another mineral that helps the brain make melatonin. A lack of calcium can cause you to wake up in the middle of the night and have difficulty returning to sleep. Some foods are naturally packed with these essential vitamins and minerals. Here’s a list:For, have dairy products (milk, low-fat yogurt, cheese); poultry (turkey, chicken); seafood (shrimp, salmon, halibut, tuna, sardines, cod); nuts and seeds (flax, sesame, pumpkin, sunflower, cashews, peanuts, almonds, walnuts).Forhave dark leafy greens (baby spinach, kale, collard greens), wheat germ, fish (salmon, halibut, tuna, and mackerel), soybeans, and banana.For, have low-fat milk, cheeses, yogurt, sardines, fortified cereals and soybeans.For, have sunflower seeds, pistachio nuts, flaxseed, fish (tuna, salmon, and halibut), and dried prunes. For, have fruits and vegetables like corn, asparagus, tomatoes, pomegranate, olives, grapes, broccoli, cucumber; grains like rice, barley, rolled oats and nuts and seeds.Foods high in fat have been linked to poor, fragmented sleep.

The Shivarajkumar-starrer, which sees the actor teaming up with director A Harsha for the third time, has led to much curiosity as the team has not been forthcoming with any publicity material from the movie. In a first, the look of the leading lady Bhavana is now available with BT.Director Harsha shares that a lot of brain storming went into creating this get-up for Bhavana. “Having been seen as the girl-next-door in most of her films until now, this is a character that is clearly a first for Bhavana. While revealing anything more about her character might be a spoiler, her gritty and fierce avatar will surely be a sign of the things to come,” points out Harsha. The actress, he adds, is slated for a knockout performance as she pairs with Shivarajkumar for the second time, after Tagaru . “It’s an intriguing character and her look will only add further gravitas,” says Harsha. Shivarajkumar, too, sports an interesting look, which is a highlight.Harsha tells us that he plans to introduce the seven main characters of his film — who have all got stunning makeovers — one by one in subsequent weeks.

Wabi-sabi and burnt wood are also coming back.Minimal spaces with personalisation will be in. Don’t chuck all your possessions, but try some “intimate minimalism”.

We had told you about actor Suraj Gowda turning writer as he penned his upcoming film Ninna Sanihake . Now, here’s another update from the sets of the film. The team confirms that Suraj will also be credited as director for the film. The team has also applied for a change of director in the registration, as it was originally supposed to be directed by Suman Jadugar . The reason for this is amicable and Suman is still part of the film’s direction team, we hear. “Suman met with an accident on the third day of the shoot. As we couldn’t stop the shoot, I took over the reins then and oversaw all the work on and off the sets those days. When Suman resumed work on the set, he saw the output and said that it was very good and the film had shaped up well. It was then that the team reached a consensus that I’d continue directing the film, which is based on a story that was written by me,” says Suraj.The film marks the debut of late matinee idol Dr Rajkumar ’s granddaughter Dhanya Ramkumar , who is paired opposite Suraj in the film. “We have around one week’s shoot left,"" he adds.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73098666,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-138601/73098666.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/suraj-gowda-turns-director-for-ninna-sanihake/articleshow/73098664.cms
7,['5/01/2020'],Beauty in blue,"Classic Blue is certainly an all-inclusive trend that’s not only hot in fashion but in make-up too. In fact, the cool and striking shade is already inspiring countless beauty and make-up looks. Think classic blue eye liner, eye shadow and nail varnish. Yes, coloured eyeliner is a major trend for the coming season and has been a rage at catwalks around the world. “Blue is a very flattering colour for the Indian skin tone. Apart from a simple blue eyeliner, you can try blue eye shadow or a thick line of blue-coloured shadow above a black eyeliner, while lining the lower lid only with the coloured shadow. Blue can also be used only to line the outer corners of the eyes, or just the inner corners of the eyes. For a softer look, blend the blue-coloured shadow from dark to light, from the eyelids going upwards. The colour should be lighter above the crease,” says beauty expert Shahnaz Husain.“Alternatively, nude make-up for the eyes can be paired with bold lips. Those who like to experiment can try a classic blue lipstick with a pearly finish,” adds Husain.Classic blue has a rare quality of making you look cool or glamorous, depending on how you use the hue in your make-up. While a simple blue liner can go well with a casual ensemble, dark blue glittery eyeshadow can have a magical effect for a night out with friends or a glitzy evening on the red carpet.When using classic blue in make-up, it is necessary to keep the colour of the dress in mind. For instance, a green coloured outfit with blue eye shadow or eyeliner would really clash. A light coloured, grey, white or light blue shimmering dress would go with blue make-up colours. Blue eye shadow or liner would go best with dark brown or black hair.- Little is enough- Focus on one feature only – lips or eyes- When using classic blue, keep the skin clean and complexion dewy and flawless. A light coverage foundation works well- Balance blue lips or eyes with a neutral cheek highlighter",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73069402,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-115523/73069402.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/beauty/beauty-in-blue/articleshow/73069372.cms
8,['5/01/2020'],An yearful of trends,"A bit of crystal gazing for the year ahead on what is bound to keep you stylish in 20201. Suit yourselfThe suits are here to stay and 2020 is going to see a variety of them from classic tailored ones to sexy draped silhouettes. In fact, pant suits were a big trend last year and many celebrities endorsed the look – globally and in India. It will continue to get more attention and is only bound to get edgier with more attention to detail, styles and a lot of embroidery. This power trend lets you walk in like a boss.2. Explosion ofsocial e-commerceThe process of making purchases directly on a social media platform has been increasingly gaining ground over the past few years and this trend will continue onwards as we move into 2020. As consumers turn to social media for product recommendations and reviews before making a purchase decision, naturally, the concept of social commerce is gaining momentum.3. Be boldThe year 2020 is all about wearing your fashion statement on your sleeve – and it’s not understated. From bold colour blocking with bright and statement-making hues clubbed together to bolder accessories, the name of the game is to not be subtle. There’ll be more layering, be it clothes or jewellery. Everything will be exaggerated like dramatic sleeve, big earrings to oversized sunglasses and bags. This is the year of high-volume dresses, playful feathers, bold neons, statement retro prints, and dramatic fringes.4. Getting ‘woke’Consumers now increasingly back their beliefs with their shopping habits, favouring brands that are aligned with their values and avoiding those that aren’t. There’s a growing non-acceptance in the world of fashion when it comes to lack of diversity and uninspiring or unoriginal brand philosophies. However, as major brands continue to adapt their business models to this trend, customers will be more skeptical than ever regarding how sincere these efforts are. Fast fashion will slow down with more people buying clothes that are easily mixed and matching and upcycled rather than single statement pieces. There’s a rise in re-sales, swaps and second-hand market.5. Ruffle it upRuffles and gathers rather MORE ruffles and gathers is an undying trend that will continue to rule the fashion runway. It is the perfect dose of drama.6. DesignercollaborationsAs consumers look for innovation in design and a chance to own high-end products at a much affordable price, designer collaborations are expected to become even bigger this year.7. Leather is backIn small ways and big, from detailings and trims to two-piece co-ords, leather is here to stay. But given the current ‘woke’ fashion trend, many will opt for faux or cruelty-free leather – basically vegan leather is going to be big.8. time for comebacksFashion has been in a cycle of revival for some time. And 2020 is no different. The puffy Victorian sleeve is all set to be one of the biggest trends as are the retro prints. Be it 60s inspired florals or retro, the more drama you can create, the better. With the return of graphic polka dots, disco collars, ’60s wallpaper prints, hot pants and dramatic feathers – 2020 will see a lot many comebacks.9. Dots the wayPolka dots are back and how. This all-time classic is back on any outfit whether contemporary, Indian or western. This year dots will be seen on accessories too from shoes, bags and even hair clips. Men can also incorporate polka dots in the form of oversized sweatshirts, pocket squares or scarfs.10. What’s more?This will be the year of fringes and tassels and they are likely to be everywhere from cropped jackets to fringe-adorned boots. In terms of colours, yellow and all its shades are back as a trend. In fact, marigold shade — a cusp between gold and mustard — is going to be ‘the’ pick for both men and women. Also, among other accents, glitter and sequins will move from party wear to everyday wear.Tanvi Malik, co-founder of popular fashion e-commerce sites; designers Saaksha & Kinni; Nanki Papneja; Rhea Pillai Rastogi; Pooja Shroff; Arpita Mehta",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73084663,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-379700/73084663.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/style-guide/an-yearful-of-trends/articleshow/73084663.cms
9,['5/01/2020'],Will Hema Commission report shake up the cinema industry?,"The report by Justice Hema Commission that studied the issues faced by women in Malayalam film industry has made way for debates across Kerala. The study by the committee headed by retired High Court judge K Hema and veteran actor Sharada and former bureaucrat K B Valsala Kumari as members, has confirmed the practices of casting couch , unofficial bans and gender discrimination in the industry.While talking to Kochi Times, in an exclusive interview, Justice Hema revealed that making a demand for sex in return for a role or job and denying the person the opportunity if they resist exists only in cinema. “Everybody says sexual harassment in workplace is there everywhere, but you need to understand that casting couch exists only in the film industry. If somehow they manage to get a film and then they express resentment against ‘compromises’, the torture begins. Also, there are many human rights and constitutional violations. Film is not a world that we imagine,” she said.Adding further she said, ""Women in cinema and men too, face unofficial bans. If a woman refuses to oblige or expresses her resentment to sexual harassment at workplace, she is banned from cinema, for no fault of hers."" Justice Hema also urged that a tribunal should be formed, and statute should be implemented. That alone will be a solution to the injustice in Malayalam film industry. Those from the film industry react to the findings of the report.Edavela Babu, general secretary of AMMANothing in the report is related to us (AMMA). Only Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce and Kerala Film Producers Association can act based on the findings and formulate rules. There is nothing new in the study. They have only reported whatever we have been saying. Casting couch is something people here have been discussing for a long time and we should understand that it exists across the world. It isn’t something that Mollywood has discovered. ‘Compromise’ and ‘adjustment’ are individual decisions. If one decides to resist it, they won’t succumb to it. Also, I think it is about the talent here. However, if the commission says that it has happened to nearly every woman in the industry, it is an insult. I don’t deny the existence of casting couch, but we all know that it is happening in every other field. We all know how things work and if anybody has objection, let them come out. Also, let the commission reveal the names. Nothing is going to change.B Unnikrishnan, FEFKA official and filmmakerWe have been actively trying to bring in changes in the industry through various organisations, and the commission’s findings include things that even we aren’t aware of. They have interviewed 57 people, a cross section of Malayalam cinema, who have boldly spoken to the commission about the difficulties they have faced. The report can be used as a guideline for the betterment of the industry and we can plan corrective measures too. While implementing a new law, we need to keep in mind that we already have a strong and powerful law like POSH that addresses sexual harassment at work place and this can be extended to any field of work. In every other field, it is easy to implement these laws but when it comes to films, the employer keeps changing. So, what should happen is that the producers association and the government should have a constructive dialogue to implement the existing law itself.Rajeev Ravi, filmmaker and cinematographerThe issues mentioned by the commission have been open secrets in the industry. And it is really bad. We have never allowed such people to work with us. Things would have been better if the #MeToo movement that started off with great momentum had continued in the same pace in Mollywood. But it did not. Instead it ended with Alencier and Vinayakan. Women need a healthy and happy workspace. They should be respected and if there is a complaint, that should be heard, and they should be encouraged and supported to speak up and work, instead of their dignity being questioned. Considering the findings and suggestions, we need to ensure that the laws are implemented. People should point out the names of those who perpetuate these malpractices to mitigate these. It is important that those handling arts should bring in change and equality.Mala Parvathy, actressProduction controllers are the ones who rule the shooting sets. How they treat us depends on their temperaments. Some are extremely caring and are ready to give loo breaks amid the shoot. But there are also those who don’t even consider us as humans. I have fought even for water in the sets. During the shoot of Happy Sardar, I finally rented a caravan on my own expense as I couldn’t control not using a washroom for 16 hours. That became an issue. I am an optimistic person and I look at the tribunal positively. But I wonder what will be the future of those who complain? Whoever has complained will not be supported by the industry and we cannot prove that they are avoiding us due to our grievance. This is a market-driven industry and it is all about comfort zones. So, I am not sure how justice can be done. However, things are changing, and I am glad.Asha Joseph, academician and WCC memberWe should be proud that Kerala and the Malayalam film industry have joined the discussions on gender parity while it happened all over the world. Thanks to our awareness and receptiveness, we are different from other States and also we were able to identify the discrimination. We have crossed the first hurdle. Through Hema Commission, we have also documented it now. This can be considered as the base for all upcoming discussions. Now, we can think of how to transform. We are in a hopeful space now. This can be done through creating awareness in the society. Such issues are prevalent in every field where women are less visible. It is important to bring in equality and gender inclusivity to make the industry healthy one.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73098311,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-276860/73098311.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/will-hema-commission-report-shake-up-the-cinema-industry/articleshow/73098311.cms

14,['5/01/2020'],Pompeo discusses Iran situation with Indian envoy,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Harsh Vardhan Shringla (file photo)

NEW DELHI: The US has kept India in the loop about developments related to Iran following the killing of top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani . It is understood that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed the situation with outgoing Indian ambassador and foreign secretary-designate Harsh Vardhan Shringla in a meeting after the US airstrike which left Soleimani dead.

Pompeo Friday had a round of telephonic conversations with leaders across the globe as the US sought to explain its strike on Soleimani away as defensive action in response to ""imminent threats"" to American lives. He also spoke to Pakistan army chief Qamar Bajwa, bypassing PM Imran Khan , about the US decision to eliminate Soleimani.

Pompeo is learnt to have emphasised that the US remained committed to de-escalation in the region. With Iran vowing revenge though, US is deploying thousands of troops to the region.

India has been particularly concerned about the latest escalation in US-Iran tensions not just because of its ties with Iran but also the presence of 8 million Indian nationals in the region, who account for more than 50 per cent of around $ 70 billion remittances earned by India every year.

Many in India believe that the US unilateralism in taking out a senior Iranian leader has put India in a bind. It was evident from India's official reaction to Soleimani's killing in which the government sought to play safe as it called for restraint and mentioned how the world had been alarmed.

India is also worried about the fate of its Chabahar port project in Iran which allows it to bypass Pakistan in accessing central Asia and Afghanistan . Even as it forced India to cut crude imports from Iran, the US allowed special exception for Chabahar development in the name of reconstruction assistance and economic development for Afghanistan. If a war indeed is thrust upon the region, it's perhaps safe to say that work on the project will not remain unaffected.

15,['5/01/2020'],Ranji Trophy: Allround success for Goa at home,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Panaji: Goa did everything right against Manipur on the second day of the Plate Division Ranji Trophy at the Academy ground, Porvorim, on Saturday.

After taking a huge lead of 447 runs, the hosts reduced the visitors to 21-4 in the second innings when stumps were drawn.

Captain Amit Verma had a good day as he took three wickets in the last session to leave the visitors with an inning and 426-run deficit. Earlier, he scored a fluent 89 off 118 balls as Goa declared their first innings at 553-5.

Verma bowled with a plan and set fielding perfectly. He got his first scalp when Sultan Karim failed to judge a length delivery. Trying to cut, he missed the ball and got bowled. Left-arm orthodox Darshan Misal chipped in when he caught Bonny Chingangbam plumb in front for 2. Al Bashid Muhammed, Manipur's top scorer in the first innings, struck two fours and was getting set. However, his stay at the crease was cut short by Verma who foxed him with a straight one. The ball hit the pad and the umpire had no hesitation in raising his finger.

Akshaykumar Singh (0) followed suit as he played a wrong line to get out LBW off Verma.

Earlier, resuming on 225-2, Vaibhav Govekar (88) and night watchman Amulya Pandrekar got off to a great start. Vaibhav could have scored a century on debut. However, allrounder Rex Rajkumar broke through his defence to shatter the left-hander's dream.

Surprise package Amulya, who has been consistent with the bat, was unlucky to miss his half-century, but he did what was expected of him — survive the morning session. Though Rex bowled him for 47, Goa were nicely set at 364-4. Verma batted fluently as he smashed a six and ten fours. His dismissal brought Suyash Prabhudessai, who has been in an excellent form.

What followed was a leather hunt for Manipur. Smit Patel , who usually batted one down, flourished in the middle order. He brought up his ninth century off 117 balls, while Suyash hit a quickfire 61 off 82 balls as the pair recorded an unbeaten 154 run partnership for the sixth wicket. Manipur bowlers toiled for 130 overs. Rex was the only bowler who took two wickets.

Brief scores: Manipur 106 & 21-4 (Amit Verma 3-10) vs Goa 553-5 decl in 130.3 overs (Sumiran Amonkar 115, Smit Patel 100*, Amit 89, Vaibhav Govekar 88; Rex Rajkumar 2-78).

16,['5/01/2020'],I-League: Plaza strikes at death as Churchill Bros end East Bengal’s unbeaten run,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Margao: Alejandro Menendez picked up the first ever I-League coach of the month award for steering an unbeaten East Bengal to the top of the table, but 90 minutes later, he was left with nothing to smile at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday.

For most part it looked like East Bengal would return to Kolkata with their unbeaten record intact. But Churchill Brothers FC had other ideas. Smarting from their unexpected loss against Indian Arrows in the previous game, Churchill rose to the occasion with captain Willis Plaza heading home the only goal of the match in the final minute of regulation time.

The 1-0 victory was Churchill’s third in four games and takes them to the top of the table with nine points. The man who plotted all this – Plaza --- remains a familiar name at both ends. For Churchill fans, he is the same player who frustrates and entertains in equal measure, while every time he scores, East Bengal wonder if it’s the same player who they chased away not too long ago.

Even before he made the difference, Plaza was at the centre of everyone’s attention. He had one of his headers kiss the upright, and not surprisingly for someone who doesn’t have an impressive first touch, shot wide from encouraging positions. In the end, though, all was forgotten as he scored the goal that separated the two sides.

East Bengal will be disappointed. They had a majority of the ball in the first session and seemed in control of the proceedings. Jaime Colado came up with some delightful balls and Juan Mera was a constant threat in the rival danger zone, yet the end product was lacking. The visitors could argue that they had found the back of the net when Colado’s corner kick sailed straight into the goal. They celebrated too, only to discover that Mehtab Singh has been adjudged to have fouled goalkeeper Jafar Mondal on the goalline.

There were other chances, largely those that fell at the feet of Juan Mera and Lalrindika Ralte inside the box. The Spanish forward first saw him being disposed just in the nick of time by Richard Costa, and a blazing left-footer brushed the upright before sailing out. Dika couldn’t keep his attempt on target from handshaking distance.

Without the injured Ceesay Dawda, Churchill lacked creativity in midfield. The likes of Costa, Glan Martins and even Kalif AlHasan were all enterprising, without really doing much of a damage to the rival citadel.

The major threat, of course, came from Plaza. The Trinidad and Tobago striker bulldozed his way through the East Bengal defence and, from dead-ball situations, had the tall Radanfah Abu Bakr proving an able ally in aerial battles.

The only goal came with a smart header from Plaza who beat his marker, and sandwiched between two defenders, did well to nod substitute Israil Gurung’s inch-perfect cross into the net.

17,['5/01/2020'],"After Churchill scalp, young Arrows high on confidence","This story is from January 5, 2020

Panaji: If a goal can work wonders for a striker’s confidence, imagine what victory, their first, would do to a young side, playing against giants in the I-League .

Indian Arrows find themselves with a spring in their step ever since they accounted for Churchill Brothers FC 2-1 in the previous game. They were a goal down but turned the tables on the heavyweights to not just register their first win in four matches but also hand Churchill their first defeat, that too at home.

Coach Shanmugham Venkatesh, formerly assistant with the Indian team, understands the importance of the victory and has challenged his boys to make winning a habit. That should start with NEROCA at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco on Sunday.

“The (Churchill) result will motivate the players. The game (against NEROCA) has three points for us. This team has been together now for four matches and they got the confidence by playing together. We should go for victory,” said Venkatesh.

The young developmental side of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) gave a wonderful account of themselves. They lost the first three games quite narrowly, before opening their account against Churchill.

“We have to now move forward. Three points are at stake,” said Aman Chetri, who provided the assist for Givson Singh’s equaliser.

NEROCA have four points from their first four matches. That’s not an impressive show, even on debut, but a well-fought draw at the home of the defending champions Chennai City in their last outing would have set them up nicely for Sunday’s battle.

“We have to take Indian Arrows seriously. In the last game, they fought well for victory against Churchill. We respect Indian Arrows. They are young lads and great hope for the future. We will need to work hard,” said coach Gift Raikhan

The NEROCA coach said the team needs reinforcements to challenge the best in business and is expecting the arrival of some players who can provide help.

“NEROCA started late and now the transfer window is open for us. We may change three or four players. Unfortunately, we are not doing well at the moment, but a good result can get us back on track,” said the coach.

18,['5/01/2020'],"I actually like a nice boring life, routine is underrated: Kajol","When we meet Kajol at a suburban five star, she is reminiscent of Julia Roberts in 'Runaway Bride'. Dressed in a gorgeous ethnic gown, her choice of footwear is white sneakers. ‘Comfort comes first’, she chuckles before elaborating on finding the airport and gym looks amusing. You can’t help but notice that Kajol is an amalgamation of her popular screen characters. She is as family oriented as Simran from 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (DDLJ), as vulnerable as Anjali from 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' (KKHH) and as vivacious, chirpy and rooted in her culture as Anjali in 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' (K3G). In a chat with BT, the actress talks about motherhood being a role that’s a work in progress, career post marriage and the upcoming home production, 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior', with husband Ajay Devgn. Excerpts...I am perfect the way I am. I don’t want to change anything about myself except for what will happen organically. I don’t like too many changes. I actually like a nice boring life, routine is underrated. For me, no news is good news. When people ask me, ‘What’s happening in your life?’ or ‘What’s new?’, I tell them, ‘Nothing, really. I am doing the same old s**t and loving every bit of it’. There is no hot gossip in my life whatsoever.The first two films — 'Baazigar' (1993) and 'Karan Arjun' (1995) — that we did together, worked so well that there was no looking back. Be it 'DDLJ' (1995), 'KKHH' (1998), 'K3G' (2001) or 'My Name Is Khan' (2010), we have been lucky with the kind of films that we got to do. Also, it matters whether you get along with your co-star. We were and still are good friends. We are extremely comfortable around each other and that translates on screen and creates that chemistry you are talking about. When we do a scene, he knows exactly what I am going to do and vice versa.We have worked together in many films, and at home also, we work together (smiles!). So, we are used to it. Ajay is the same, be it at home or on the set, and I have always loved that about him. He doesn’t change according to the environment. I am a talkative person, while he is extra quiet.We have tried not to offend anyone. Of course, we have taken certain cinematic liberties, but we have tried to be as authentic as possible. Having said that, you can’t keep everyone happy. These days, everyone has an opinion and they have platforms to voice it. We just have to wait for the film to release and judge it after watching it.There is definitely more pressure on today’s generation of stars to be perfectly turned out at all times, even when they are coming out of a gym. Those pictures are shockingly good. Thank God, nobody sees me in the gym, because it’s not a pretty sight! Yes, the pressure is more, but so are the opportunities. When we did films in the past, you either failed dramatically or succeeded dramatically. There was no middle ground. Today, there is that nice, happy middle ground where everyone doesn’t have to be number one. It’s a more secure place for them to be. Even if you don’t want to work in films as actors, there are so many other things to do. You can start your own business, be it in fashion or film production, and people won’t look down and say, ‘Oh! She is starting her own business because she is not doing well in films’. That fear is not there anymore. Also, you can act and simultaneously do these things. So many actors today are doing so many things at the same time, it is all about being able to multitask.I have always been like that. I am too lazy and that came across as rule-breaking (laughs!). I was stubborn and yes, I did make certain choices which were a little unusual. I usually go by my instinct, whether it is films or other choices in life. The story needs to work for me before I give a nod to a film. As far as getting married early is concerned, I don’t think that it was a big deal even back then. You had Sharmila Tagore, my mother Tanuja , Sadhana, Saira Banu… all of them continued doing films after marriage. Today, almost every woman continues to work after marriage and that’s fabulous.After marriage, I felt that I had the freedom to choose different films. I didn’t want to do run-of-the-mill films. Not that I ever wanted to do such movies, but at one point, I know that I may have. Today, the opportunities are huge as the writing in cinema is better.There are times when every mother gets hyper and protective about her children. I have hopefully drawn myself back, but there are momentary lapses. So, I swing between being Helicopter Eela and myself. I keep telling myself, ‘Remember what you were like when you were 16’. I am relatively more chilled out, while Ajay gets more hyper about them.I am convinced that this airport culture is in everyone’s heads. Have you seen regular people at the airport? Sweatshirts, jeans and sports shoes — 90 per cent of people wear this. The remaining almost 10 per cent wear uniforms because they are airport personnel. Only point one per cent people wear heels and walk out with their hair perfectly styled and in fashionable clothes, like they have just stepped out of a salon and right onto the red carpet. I don’t know what to say! Even the gym look, I wonder if they go to the gym and then to the parlour and then step out! The hair looks blow-dried, and they wear perfect clothes that match the shoes. The whole look is colour coordinated. You will not see them repeating gym clothes, while I have two pairs of gym wear. Also, I don’t know how people even shoot those gym videos. Placing the camera in the right angle to capture the workout… You have no clue how much effort they have to take to look that way. I choose not to take everything too seriously. We need to stop making a big deal out of everything. If your photograph did not get the maximum likes on Instagram, it’s fine (laughs!). I use this platform for fun. The minute it starts feeling like work, I will disconnect from it. I have realised the importance of social media and it does make a difference to me, but I cannot make it my bread and butter. I can’t be stressed about what I am going to post two days from now and uska caption kya hoga.Please don’t think that if you change your nose or lips to look like someone, you, too, will stand out. You won’t. It’s a myth. If you get Katrina Kaif’s nose or someone’s cheek bones or someone’s lips, you won’t stand out. It will not make your career more interesting or your rise meteoric. It will do nothing except make you blend in, when you actually want to stand out. Focus on who you are and your work. Also, if you want to enhance your face, there’s always make-up. It is meant to correct what you think is slightly lacking in your face. I won’t say flaws, as every face is unique, but if you think something is lacking, use make-up instead.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73098288,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-109837/73098288.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/i-actually-like-a-nice-boring-life-routine-is-underrated-kajol/articleshow/73098288.cms
19,['5/01/2020'],Aly Goni: I am extremely happy for Natasa Stankovic,"The news of cricketer Hardik Pandya getting engaged to Serbian model-actress Natasa Stankovic took everyone by surprise. A few months ago, she had participated in the dance reality show, ' Nach Baliye ', with her ex-boyfriend, TV actor Aly Goni , who she dated for a year in 2014. The two, as exes, had put up some good performances on the show and were the third runners-up. TOI spoke to Aly after Natasa’s recent engagement , and he said, “Natasa told me about her relationship with Hardik some time ago. She really loves him a lot and so does he. I remember, during 'Nach Baliye', he would often call to check on her. They look nice together and I am very happy for her. They make a perfect match. Natasa is a darling; she is sweet and caring.”So, was he aware of their engagement plan? “No, I wasn’t. Even Natasa was taken by surprise; or else, she would have told me because we are close. I messaged her and she said that the feeling is still sinking in,” he replied.Aly hasn’t met Hardik yet. He said, “I have spoken to him a couple of times, as Natasa and I would practically be together for eight-nine hours rehearsing for 'Nach Baliye'. I plan to meet them soon and congratulate them in person.”During the show, Aly and Natasa were inseparable, and their camaraderie even led to speculations that they might rekindle their romance. However, Aly said that it was never a possibility. It’s funny how some people are reacting to this news (of Natasa’s engagement) on social media. They are making memes on it with me crying in the background to the song, 'Channa Mereya' ('Ae Dil Hai Mushkil') (laughs!). I have also been inundated with sympathy messages. What’s wrong with these people? I guess they can’t envision two exes becoming friends, as they might not be capable of it. Natasa and I were sure that we won’t get back into a relationship with each other again. We attempted it once previously, but it didn’t work out. However, our split hasn’t changed our equation. We were very young when we started dating. Even then, we were buddies first. We parted on a good note and continue to be great friends. That’s also a reason why I could participate with her on Nach Baliye. I don’t think I would have been able to do that with anyone else.”Aly, who has featured in shows like 'Yeh Hai Mohabbatein' and 'Naagin 3', has often been linked with actress Jasmin Bhasin , who was his fellow contestant in 'Khatron Ke Khiladi'. When asked about it, he said, “I don’t know how to define our relationship, it’s a pure and good friendship. Jasmin is closest to me. She is more than a best friend. I don’t have many friends in the industry. We talk to each other about everything under the sun, and I always make fun of her. I don’t want to give it a tag, as I don’t want to make it ugly. For now, friendship is a better bond. If there could be anything more than that, I am not sure about it yet.”Calling himself “commitment phobic”, he added, “I am focussing on work at the moment. Also, I would want to marry someone who is not from the industry. I aspire to lead a normal life when I am not working. I would want to talk beyond just ‘lights, camera and action’.”On the work front, the actor has taken time out from fiction shows. “I am working on myself and will be back in action soon,” he signed off.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73097737,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-92367/73097737.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/aly-goni-i-am-extremely-happy-for-natasa-stankovic/articleshow/73097697.cms

Sportspersons on mental health

""I have gone through a phase in my career where I felt like it was the end of the world. In England in 2014, I just didn’t know what to do, what to say to anyone, how to speak, how to communicate. I could have said that I am not feeling great mentally and need to get away from the game. But you never know how that’s taken.” These were the words of Virat Kohli , the captain of the Indian cricket team and arguably the best cricketer in the world today. This admission came on the heels of several Australian cricketers taking time off from the game to focus on their mental health . It merely highlights the pressures professional sportspersons – even the best ones – go through. In today’s time when media glare on sportspersons has increased and social media has enabled millions of fans to criticise any athlete directly, most sportspersons live in a pressure cooker of their own creation, where performance-related anxiety and insecurity leads to issues in personal lives as well.Experts say the first lesson sportspersons need to imbibe is to not associate self-worth and self-esteem with their performance or form. Paddy Upton, who was Indian cricket team’s mental conditioning coach and has coached several T20 teams around the globe, says, “The key is to help a player understand that who they are as a person and what they do on the ground are two different things. They need to separate the results – good or bad – from their personal lives. I have seen a lot of cases where players don’t do that. When they are playing well, they are high on confidence and feel everything in their life is good. Similarly, when they hit a rough patch, they feel it’s the end of the world. That needs to be avoided.”Elite athletes say that surrounding yourself with the people you love helps because your friends and family are the ones who like you as a person and not necessarily for what you do out on the field of play. “You have to make sure the right people have influence on you. Family and friends are massive because they know the person you are. They like you regardless of whether you are an international cricketer or not. You don’t have to please them. You can be yourself around them. They keep you grounded,” England cricketer Ben Stokes had told us last April. Paddy Upton, however, cautions against over-reliance on family and friends. “In a lot of cases, the love you get from your family is contingent on you doing well in the sport. Indian parents and families, in particular, are guilty of doing that more often. The focus should be on surrounding yourself with the right people.”An added complication for athletes is the expectation society has from them of ‘staying tough’. Any vulnerability is seen as a weakness. Track and field athlete Dutee Chand says, “Every professional athlete has fear, doubts and negative thoughts. But people expect you to just ignore them and move forward. Even certain athletes feel that expressing these things is bad and they can be used against you on the field of play.” Many feel that the media glare and fan attention to their mental health troubles would derail their careers, and hence do not speak out. “I was scared that if I went to a psychologist, people would write in the newspapers. So I put on a brave front,” says former Indian cricketer Maninder Singh, who dealt with depression and alcoholism in the twilight of his career in the 1990s.Despite the stigma, an increasing number of athletes are now stepping away from that ‘pressure cooker’ as soon as they find themselves in the middle of a downward spiral. 22-year-old cricketer Aryaman Birla, who was part of the IPL team Rajasthan Royals and the Madhya Pradesh Ranji team, took an indefinite sabbatical from the game in December, citing “severe anxiety related to the sport”. He says, “My anxiety was very directly related to the sport. It’s a feeling that is very claustrophobic. I did deal with it for a while and tried to tide over it while playing the game. However, it did come to a point where I felt that taking a break was the best option for me. This decision was extremely tough, and highly emotional, as one can imagine. These sort of calls are very individual-centric and whatever works best for that particular person, must be respected.”Athletes argue that having a professional support system can help remove this stigma around mental illness. An increasing number of professional sportspersons and teams now opt for full time psychologists or mental health coaches. A few months ago, Harmanpreet Kaur, the Indian women’s cricket captain in T20Is, urged the BCCI to appoint a psychologist for the team. “Nowadays, the pressure is high. You need someone to discuss things when they are not fine,” she had told the media. Indian hockey player PR Sreejesh agrees with this trend. “I have the experience of so many years, I don’t need to get advice from a person on that.

21,['5/01/2020'],"Even if I had just two-three scenes, I would want to be part of a film like Chhapaak: Vikrant Massey","From being a part of successful television shows like Balika Vadhu (2010) and Qubool Hai (2013) to doing commercial Bollywood films like Dil Dhadakne Do (2015) and Half Girlfriend (2017) among others, Vikrant Massey has come a long way. The actor , who made his Bollywood debut with Lootera (2013), has also been part of award-winning films like A Death In The Gunj (2017) and the controversial movie, Lipstick Under My Burkha (2017). His next — Chhapaak , directed by Meghna Gulzar — focuses on acid attack survivors. In a chat with BT, ahead of the film’s release, Vikrant speaks about his co-star and co-producer Deepika Padukone and his role in the film. Excerpts...Just like every other individual associated with the film, I, too, wanted to be a part of it, immediately. When I heard the narration, I was shaken up. I was also looking forward to collaborating with someone like Meghna Gulzar, irrespective of what the length of my role would be.I had made up my mind that even if I had just two-three scenes, I would want to be a part of it, as I had read the story of Laxmi Agarwal (an acid attack survivor on whom the film is based). As a crime, acid attack has been ignored for the longest time, though it has seen an alarming rise. It’s high time we reached out to as many people as possible and spread awareness about it. And, it could have been possible only with someone of Deepika’s stature; she will help us reach out to a much wider audience across the world. Films like these should be made. Yes, at the end of it all, everyone wants to make money. Unfortunately, today, a certain section in the industry has started evaluating the success and impact of a film, based on its box-office numbers. This entire practice, I strongly feel, is corrupt.(Cuts in…) It is not a depressing tale, as ultimately, the person facing an acid attack is not a victim, but a survivor. They are fighters. Despite facing all of this, they have the will power and the strength to stand up on their own and face the world. It’s a journey from being a victim to being victorious.I have met Deepika socially prior to this film. We interacted during the shoot of Dil Dhadakne Do, which also featured Ranveer Singh. She was on the ship (on which major portions of the film was shot) with us for a couple of days. We generally chatted and had a few conversations. She was on a holiday, but we were working (laughs!). Whatever little time I spent with her was wonderful. I am glad that I got an opportunity to work with her, especially on this project. In terms of our on-screen chemistry, this film brought out all the possible vulnerabilities within each one of us. As people, we were emotionally pure and naked in front of each other. Also, when your director is Meghna Gulzar, half of your job is taken care of. I think we have done a fair job.Well, Meghnaji wanted to work with me ever since she saw A Death In The Gunj. Personally, I have always wanted to work with her, too. Her directorial, Talvar (2015), happens to be one of my favourite films. I have been an ardent admirer of her work and wanted to get a glimpse into her process of filmmaking.During the course of the shoot, I never felt that she was the producer, she was always my co-actor. When we were together, our only focus was to get the shot right. I don’t think at that time she was thinking what the balance sheets were looking like.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73098967,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-76823/73098967.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/even-if-i-had-just-two-three-scenes-i-would-want-to-be-part-of-a-film-like-chhapaak-vikrant-massey/articleshow/73098926.cms

Looking for love this new year? January 5 might just be the best day to find it. We’re not saying it – dating apps and their surveys are. According to several websites and dating apps, Dating Sunday – which is today – is expected to be the busiest day of the year for online dating.According to the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel, in 2019, more than a million messages were sent on January 6 (last year’s Dating Sunday), making it the most active day in the app’s seven-year history. Figures also point out that the following Sunday was the second most active chat day, with just a 3% decrease in messages sent (from Dating Sunday). Dating app Match predicts an 80% increase in singles flocking to its app today to make a romantic connection. Bumble has been expecting to see over 3 million new users join the app between Thanksgiving 2019 and Dating Sunday. Priti Joshi, Vice President of Strategy, Bumble, says, “The Sunday after the long holiday stretch – and the day before the first working week of 2020 – represents a fresh start, and an opportunity for a clean slate, not just for dating but for seeking new friendships and career opportunities, which leads to a major hike in downloads and interaction on the app.”Dating Sunday, experts say, “is so popular because it comes at a time when people typically feel lonely.” Twenty-two-year-old Megha Mukherjee says, “Holidays can be slightly sad for someone who’s single, especially when everyone around you has a date for all the social events. Dating apps are a good place to start.”And though she says the pool of people on all the dating apps is largely the same, she adds that “these apps are easily accessible and the best way to meet someone quickly.” Festive spirits and chilly weather coupled with parties and the approaching Valentine’s Day make this a period when singles are on the look out for a a partner. “You have people recovering from a break-up or those who were feeling low during the holidays. Then you have all those New Year’s resolutions, and you have the clock ticking for Valentine’s Day. It’s the first lonely holiday after the New Year,” cyber-dating expert Julie Spira told an online media outlet.According to Match’s chief dating expert Rachel DeAlto, enquiring about dream vacation destinations or starting a game of Two Truths and a Lie can be appropriate conversation starters",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73098561,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-101345/73098561.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/relationships/love-sex/datingsunday-the-best-day-to-get-swiping-is-here/articleshow/73097285.cms

Rahul Manglik, a Delhiite studying at IIT-Bombay, was among the students to get 99.99 percentile. Girls, though, did not make it to the list of 21 students who managed to get the second best score. A student of BITS-Pilani got the highest score among females with 99.98 percentile. Over 35% of the test-takers this year were girls.Six of the toppers are IITians, two are from NITs, and one each from Jadavpur University and a deemed university in Karnataka, said an official from IIM-Kozhikode, which conducted CAT 2019.While four from Maharashtra made it to the top 10, the others were from Karnataka, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. IIT-Bombay student Somansh Chordia, NIT-Surat student Rishi Mittal, Patrick D’Souza, a serial CAT-taker who runs his own coaching institute, and another faculty member from a leading coaching institute are the toppers from Maharashtra. Maharashtra had the highest numbers of toppers even last year.Chordia bagged the perfect score in his very first attempt. A mechanical engineering student from IIT-Bombay, he had to juggle his final-year exams and CAT preparation. He bagged a job in a coveted Japanese firm last month during campus placements.Rishi Mittal joined NIT-Surat to pursue his B-Tech in civil engineering. Now in his final year, he hopes to crack the interview at one of the top three IIMs. “I never sat for campus placements as I wanted to complete my studies,” he said.While fewer girls bagging the top slots is a concern, IIMs have been taking corrective measures to include more women on their campuses. “The weightage given to CAT has dropped over the years. More females are taking the test because they are aware of the additional weightage given by IIMs during admissions. The paper-setters also know that the attempt rate must improve. Earlier, it was very difficult to crack the test, but now the problem is getting solved to a great extent.

27,['5/01/2020'],"In the land of the thin-skinned, even Faiz and Nagarjun offend","It is not often that the word Om, with all its profundity, occurs next to the slur ‘ullu ke pathe’. But Baba Nagarjun , one of the greatest Hindi poets of the 20th century, was not a man who cared for profundities. So much so that his irreverence irked a member of the audience at a recent arts festival in Goa into filing a case for hurting his “Hindu” sentiments.The one word often used to describe Nagarjun, whose life spanned almost the entire 20th century (1911-98), is ‘avghad’, a hard word to translate but one that subsumes a world of meanings – irreverent, irrepressible, fearless, ascetic, irascible…in short, a man beyond convention.In 1969, in what can only be described as a raging poetic rant dipped in pitch-black humour, Nagarjun flung every act of political chicanery into a havan of contempt with his poem Mantra Kavita. Prefixing every one of its 12 lines with Om, and with incomparable wordcraft, he tore into every pious hypocrisy of Indian politics using great wordcraft: dynastic rule, empty rhetoric, opportunism, vote banks, ideologism, self-righteous authoritarianism, violence, everything that will keep this poem relevant for every age.Most of the barbs land firmly and fully on the Congress regime of the time, with an especially clairvoyant crack at the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty: Om hamesha hamesha raj karega mera pota.Here is a sample of his difficult-to-translate verse that could come off any day’s headlines:Om dalon mein ek dal apna dal om,Om angikaran, shuddhikaran, rashtrikaran,Om mushtikaran, tushtikaran, pushtikaran omOm aitrazz, aksheep, anushasan omOm gaddi par aajanm vajrasanMantra Kavita today has cult status as a genre-defying work for many reasons — its cadence, its defiant heartbeat and its sheer brilliance in melding realism, nonsense words, piety and commentary into a dramatic chant. It is hardly surprising that across decades it has become a staple on the cultural scene, excerpted, recited and discussed in films, dastangoi, and now digital poetry platforms.“Om is a liberating sound especially when you find yourself suffocated by the political, social and religious dogmas being stuffed down your throat,” says journalist Ravish, who has recited it for Hindi Kavita, a YouTube poetry channel.If Mantra Kavita should offend someone, it should be an ideologically bankrupt, wheeling-dealing neta. For the aam aadmi, there could be no truer, funnier summary of India’s unending political tamasha. Yet, indie music group, Dastaan Live, found a case slapped on it for performing it as a song. Its lyrics, went the complaint, combined “Om with abusive language”. For this, the musicians were booked under section 295 (hurting religious sentiments).There is not a strand of our cultural life that is not upsetting touchy folks today. From cinema to music, theatre to dance, anything that doesn’t stick to the formulaic or questions the existing order is up for instant, uninformed offence-taking. A quick Google search should be enough today to fact-check the story behind a song/poem/play that is making you bristle with righteous indignation. Who wrote it? Why? Do four words used in conjunction necessarily add up to an insult against a religion? Could you be wrong?It is almost as if it is more important to be offended than to be informed.“Who knows Faiz Ahmed Faiz?” asks IIT-Kanpur’s deputy director on the institute’s surreal inquiry into whether Hum Dekhenge, Faiz’s epic poem on resisting tyranny sung by student protestors, is “anti-Hindu”. Well, how difficult is it to find out who Faiz is, and if his exhortation to his compatriots to remember that Allah’s name will survive all brutal military regimes had anything to do with his views on Hinduism It is hard to believe that two centuries ago, classical Urdu poets of India could lampoon clerics and emperors and get away with it. That garish Indian films of the 80s featured mythological spoofs. That in the midst of Partition throes, Indian theatre dared to talk of communal strife. Or going further back, that Kabir could laugh at the pompousness of the brahmin and the mullah.Nagarjun, a Kabir-like iconoclast to his last breath, wrote across political eras — on the peasant movement, Nehruvian socialism, non-alignment, bank nationalisation, Emergency, globalism, Mayawati’s politics, and even the rise of Bal Thackeray. “He was an ashu kavi (instant composer), and this made him a rare chronicler of pre- and post-independent India and every significant political event,” points out litterateur Ashok Vajpeyi Nagarjun’s sting spared none, not the Congress (upset by Emergency he had famously written, ‘Induji, Induji kya hua hai aapko/Satta ki masti mein, bhool gayi hain baap ko’), not the right, not the left to which he briefly belonged, and not even the JP movement he ardently supported — as did many BJP stalwarts of today.But above all Nagarjun was, like Faiz, a humanist. “He was a poet with immense love and respect for people, any injustice infuriated him and he wrote about these in everyday words. This makes him an interventionist but one who never compromised on aesthetic standards — he remained both topical and classical,” says scholar-commentator Apoorvanand.Nagarjun’s poetry was for the marginalised Indian, and Mantra Kavita is a howl of despair at how this man/woman stands betrayed by politics. There couldn’t be a more apt poem for our times and Om couldn’t be put to a more empowering use.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73101683,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1538970,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/in-the-land-of-the-thin-skinned-even-faiz-and-nagarjun-offend/articleshow/73101656.cms
28,['5/01/2020'],"No Sikh threatened, fight was between 2 Muslim groups: Pakistan","This story is from January 5, 2020

General view of Nankana Sahib Gurdwara(file photo)

NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD: Facing flak for the vandalism at the Sikh holy shrine of Nankana Sahib , Pakistan on Saturday said the “altercation” involved two Muslim groups rather than intimidation of Sikhs inside the gurdwara — an astounding claim in the face of videos of Friday’s incident.

Pakistan said what happened at the birthplace of Guru Nanak involved two Muslim groups and attempts to paint it as communal were “patently motivated”. While India had not officially responded to the Pakistan foreign ministry’s statement till late evening, officials here described it as a blatant lie.

India had on Friday strongly condemned the attack, which saw mobs pelting stones at the gurdwara, apparently in retaliation against Sikhs filing a police complaint over the abduction, forceful conversion and marriage in August last year of Jagjit Kaur, the daughter of a granthi. The mob was led by the brother of the man Kaur was forcibly married to, and who can be heard threatening to evict Sikhs from the shrine.

According to eyewitnesses, the situation turned so tense that the local Sikh population and visiting pilgrims were forced to seek shelter in the gurdwara. A viral video of the event showed the lead instigator demanding justice for his brother, Mohammad Hassan, accused of abducting Kaur. According to Hassan’s family, Kaur “opted” to marry the accused of her own free will and is willing to testify in court.

Interestingly, religious affairs and interfaith harmony minister Noorul Haq Qadri supported the original account of the attack on the gurdwara. He told the media that the protest was organised by Hassan’s family and neighbours, demanding his release from police custody. Qadri slammed India’s attempts to transform an ordinary dispute into an example of communal strife, claiming New Delhi was trying to shift attention from its own domestic unrest.

On the other hand, the Pakistan interior ministry tried to pass off the incident as literally a “fly in a teacup”. According to them, two men, Saqlain and Mumtaz Ali , visited a tea shop near the gurdwara and complained of a fly in their tea. In response, the owners — Zaman (Hassan’s uncle), Iftikhar and Adnan (Hassan’s brother) —attacked them, resulting in a scuffle.

Pakistan said the gurdwara remained “untouched and undamaged” and added, “All insinuations to the contrary, particularly the claims of acts of ‘desecration and destruction’ and desecration of the holy place, are not only false but also mischievous.”

Official sources in Delhi said instead of taking firm action against miscreants, Pakistan was trying to give a new and absurd twist to the incident which had hurt Sikhs all over the world. “Can Pakistan also deny videos of people openly abusing Sikhs and threatening to drive them out of Nankana Sahib?” asked an Indian official.

The incident and the viral videos are a setback to Pakistan’s bid to reach out to Sikhs, stir up the Khalistani cause and create trouble for India. The reports of Jagjit Kaur’s abduction and the mob at Nankana Sahib sits poorly with Pakistan’s efforts to turn Sikh groups against India and it seems to have chosen to pretend that Friday’s incident never happened.

Professing commitment to protecting minorities, Pakistan went on to mention the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor, calling it a manifestation of Islamabad ’s special care extended to minorities.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , meanwhile, tweeted an Indian media report in which he alleged police “brutality” had reached new lows and that its “pogrom of Muslims in India continues as part of fascist Modi Govt’s ethnic cleansing agenda”. The government sees this as another attempt by Khan in the past 24 hours to divert attention from the developments at Nankana Sahib. Khan had on Friday passed off an old video from Bangladesh as that of police brutality in UP.

On Friday, dozens of angry Muslim protesters converged on Nankana Sahib, pelting the Gurdwara Janam Asthan with stones and threatening to raze it to the ground.

Some media reports suggested that four customers having tea at a stall in front of the gurdwara started a conversation about Hassan, prompting Zaman, his uncle, to react with anger, which led to a confrontation between two groups.

MUMBAI: The long-delayed portfolios in the three-party Maharashtra government were finalised on Saturday evening with NCP succeeding in securing the home department from Shiv Sena, to whom it had been allocated earlier. CM Uddhav Thackeray submitted the list of portfolios to governor B S Koshyari for approval in the evening.Ahead of the formal announcement, which is likely to be made on Sunday, indications were that given the list, Nagpur-based NCP leader Anil Deshmukh would be the home minister, while the CM would keep the general administration department and law and judiciary to himself. First-time MLA Aaditya Thackeray is slated to get environment, sports and tourism, while deputy CM Ajit Pawar would get finance and planning, Congress’s Balasaheb Thorat revenue and ex-CM Ashok Chavan the public works department. Sena’s Eknath Shinde would keep the urban development portfolio.Before submitting the list, the CM had a meeting with Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Thorat, NCP’s Ajit Pawar and Jayant Patil and Sena’s Eknath Shinde and Subhash Desai.From among the other NCP ministers, Jayant Patil is set to get the crucial water resources portfolio, while high-profile leader Chhagan Bhujbal would have to make do with the relatively insignificant food and civil supplies department. Dilip Walse Patil, who wanted the home department, would likely get excise and labour, Mumbai NCP president Nawab Malik would get skill development and minority welfare and Hasan Mushriff would be given the rural development department.Thane’s Jeetendra Awhad is likely to get housing, while Dhananjay Munde , who defeated his cousin Pankaja, will mostly get social justice. Balasaheb Patil may get cooperation and marketing, Rajendra Shingne food and drug administration and public heath is likely to be allotted to Rajesh Tope. Among NCP’s ministers of state, Aditi Tatkare is to be picked for the industries, tourism and sports portfolios, Shamburaj Desai for home (rural), Rajendra Yedrawkar for FDA, public heath and culture and Sanjay Bansode for PWD, environment and water supply.On the Sena list, Subhash Desai is set to get industries, which he had in the earlier government too, Anil Parab is likely to get transport and parliamentary affairs, Shankarrao Gadakh may be entrusted with water conservation, Sandipan Bhumare with employment guarantee scheme and Sanjay Rathod with forests. The key agriculture portfolio may go to Dada Bhuse, higher and technical education to Uday Samant and water supply and sanitation to Gulabrao Patil, while ministers of state Abdul Sattar and Bachchu Kadu will likely get revenue and water resources and the women and child welfare departments, respectively.In Congress, Nitin Raut is likely to be given the energy portfolio, while former leader of opposition Vijay Wadettiwar may get relief and rehabilitation. The two women ministers, Yashomati Thakur and Varsha Gaikwad, are likely to get women and child welfare and school education, respectively, while ex-CM Vilasrao Deshmukh’s son Amit may get medical education and culture. Sunil Kedar is to get animal husbandry and dairy development, Aslam Shaikh textiles, fisheries and ports, while among the junior ministers, Satej Patil would likely get home and housing, and Vishwajeet Kadam may be allotted cooperation and agriculture.An NCP leader blamed Congress for delay in allotment of portfolios as it had staked claim on departments linked to rural areas, particularly agriculture and water conservation.

NEW DELHI: The online chai-ordering business has turned piping hot, thanks to a simple but gamechanging heat-retaining cardboard flask that has enabled restaurants to deliver the brew fresh to consumers across cities.Business has boomed. Chai Point, a café chain focusing on tea-based beverages, has witnessed its tea-delivery business double every year. Similarly, one-fourth of Chaayos’s business currently comes from tea-delivery, which is growing at over 50% every year. Both Chai Point and Chaayos started delivering tea in 2014.“We started as a brick-and-mortar retail chain but that humble cardboard flask simply digitized our business,” Amuleek Singh, co-founder and CEO at Chai Point told TOI.For most officegoers in India, sipping quality hot tea has generally meant stepping out of office to the nearest chai shop or walking to a tea vending machine. Options were limited. Both Chai Point and Chaayos now offer a larger menu for the discerning tea-drinker: shahi chai, pahadi chai, aam-papad chai, ginger chai, jaggery tea, sulemani chai and much more.Singh, who claims that Chai Point is the first company in India to bring in the concept of the disposable flask, got the idea of getting one designed when he saw consumers walking in to his outlets with flasks to carry freshly brewed tea back with them.“In the beginning, we tried to keep traditional flasks at our outlets to deliver tea to consumers and offices. But collecting and cleaning them became too cumbersome. So, we reached out to global manufacturers of the cardboard flask,” said Singh, who had seen Dunkin Donuts deliver coffee in a similar fashion, during his Harvard Business School days.The $5 (approx. Rs 350) import cost of one flask, however, was a deterrent and Chai Point decided to get one designed here. It took the company two years, including trial runs, to launch the final product. The Make-in-India flask costs about Rs 30, bringing down the production cost to a faction of the imported one.“The flask in which we deliver tea is basically a cardboard box with several layers of polymers. It relies on the trapped air between the layers for insulation,” said Nitin Saluja, founder and CEO of Chaayos, which operates around 75 cafes across several cities.Tests conducted by the Chaayos R&D team revealed that chai poured into the flask at 90 degrees centigrade remained piping hot for around 90 minutes. “The temperature falls to around 70-75 degrees within that time. In comparison, the hot water that flows out of our geysers at home normally does so at 50 degrees,” said Saljua, the 36-year-old graduate from IIT Bombay.Orders for tea peak between 3pm and 7pm and 9.30am and 12pm with white collar workers between the age of 24 and mid 30s a key target group. The demand, however, has also started spilling over to weekends, which shows that consumers are ordering tea from their homes, as well.“It’s difficult to get hygienic and freshly brewed tea near our office so I tried ordering online for the first time. I was surprised to see the neat little flask in which tea was delivered. These days, my colleagues and I order a large flask almost every day,” said Ankita Mullick, a senior executive at a multinational bank in the Capital.Thirty-year-old media executive Sunil Patnaik has been seduced by the sheer variety of tea ranging from the pungent sulaimani tea to the Kashmiri kahwa available online. “For me, having tea is more of an occasion than a daily necessity. And I can’t even think of brewing these exotic flavours at home. So, whenever I feel like trying out a new flavour, I order online during the weekend. The fact that the tea comes to me hot and I can immediately consume it without reheating is very convenient,” said Patnaik.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73104134,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1536971,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cardboard-flask-creates-storm-in-tea-sales-across-major-cities/articleshow/73104133.cms

Protest rally against the amended Citizenship Act in Guwahati

GUWAHATI: On a day when BJP national working president JP Nadda held a mega rally in Guwahati in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu) and its allied organisations responded by staging a massive show of strength at Neherubali in Nagaon district on Saturday.

At the Guwahati rally, organised on the eve of the launch of BJP’s “CAA-2019 Jan Jagaran Abhiyan”, Nadda said CAA didn’t allow any fresh influx and gave citizenship to only persecuted migrants, who had already come and settled in the country.

“We should understand that by this Act, Modiji is giving citizenship to only those persecuted on religious grounds and who have come here before December 31, 2014.”

At the Aasu rally, its chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya said: “We are against granting citizenship to illegal Hindu Bangladeshis, and illegal Muslim Bangladeshis. In Assam, there is no place for communalism and fundamentalism.” He cautioned CM Sarbananda Sonowal against not paying heed to indigenous people, who want protection from illegal migrants.

NEW DELHI: Indian Space Research Organisation has inked a pact with Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) to pave the way for collaboration in establishing optical telescope facilities under Project ‘NETRA’ for tracking space objects. The agency has also tied up with NIT-Karnataka to set up a regional academic centre for space to promote research in space technology.

Under the Rs 400-crore NETRA’ project, an early warning system is being set up in space to detect debris and other hazards that could pose a danger to Indian space assets like satellites and experimental platforms. Like other space powers, NETRA will give the country its own capability in space situational awareness.

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Isro and IIA for space cooperation in space situational awareness and astrophysics was signed by Isro scientific secretary R Umamaheswaran and IIA director Annapurni Subramaniam at the Isro headquartes in Bengaluru on January 2. The MoU will boost tie-up between Isro and IIA in setting up optical telescope facilities for space-object tracking, studies related to space weather , asteroids and other near earth objects, an Isro statement said.

In another development, Isro has set up a regional academic centre for space at the National Institute of Technology (NIT-K) at Surathkal in Karnataka’s southwest Dakshina Kannada district. Under the agreeement signed at Surathkal on Friday , the centre will conduct joint research and development in space technology applications to meet the needs of space programmes.

Isro will provide Rs 2 crore grant annually to NIT for R&D projects and promotional activities through the year. A joint policy and management committee will guide the centre in optimal utilisation of the research potential, infrastructure, expertise and experience of the space agency and the autonomous institute. Students of BTech and MTech will be involved in one-year short-term research projects and 2-4-year-long-term projects in advance space programmes. Intellectual property rights generated in projects will be jointly owned by Isro and NIT.

HYDERABAD: Heeding the call for a ‘ Million March ’ given mainly by 40 small organisations in Hyderabad, thousands of people swarmed the city’s Dharna Chowk on Saturday afternoon to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Holding nothing but the Tricolour in their hands, the protesters brought the city to a standstill.In sharp contrast the bustling old city of Hyderabad was virtually emptied out as most of the residents gathered at the protest venue. A large number of students and people from other districts too joined the march in what was one of the biggest anti-CAA protests in the city since the amended law as passed.Addressing the massive gathering, at least two of the speakers said Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao should make his stand clear on NRC and also ensure that it is not implemented in the state. “KCR should clear his stand before voting for municipal election in the state on January 20,” said Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT) leader Amjadullah Khan. TRS had voted against CAA in both houses of parliament.Former minister in undivided Andhra Pradesh and senior Congress leader Mohammed Shabbir Ali said, “I have not seen such a massive public convergence in Hyderabad without the involvement of any political party, particularly the ruling TRS-AIMIM combine to mobilise crowds.”Another Congress leader V Hanumanth Rao told the gathering, “We have all created history by voluntarily gathering here. There could be at least two lakh people here from Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian and other communities. This should send a clear message to the RSS and BJP that they will never succeed in turning secular India into Hindu Rashtra.” The protest call was given by Muslim organisation Tehreek Muslim Shabban. Parties like Congress, CPI, CPM and the Popular Front of India too supported the event.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73105897,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-205939,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-million-march-hyderabad-comes-to-a-halt/articleshow/73104149.cms
36,['5/01/2020'],We’re target of UP’s vilification campaign: PFI,"This story is from January 5, 2020

NEW DELHI: Amid reports of UP government requesting the Centre to ban Islamic outfit Popular Front of India for its alleged role in the violence during the protests over the Citizenship Amendment Act, PFI has issue a public statement rejecting all allegations and claiming that the outfit was a target of a “vilification campaign” being carried out by UP government and police against them. PFI has said that if at all a ban is imposed on them in any state or by the Centre they will challenge it in the court of law.

PFI vice chairman O M A Salam challenged the government claiming it will not be able to find anything “inflammatory” in PFI literature and slogans. “We will fight this political vendetta through legal and democratic means,” Salam added.

He cited PFI’s ongoing legal battle in Jharkhand High Court over the ban reimposed by the state in 2018. “In February 2018, the BJP government in Jharkhand cited this unfounded and absurd reason of ‘IS influence’ for imposing a ban on the organisation in the state. Jharkhand HC had lifted the ban a year after it was first imposed in 2015. The state reimposed the ban and we have challenged it in the court. We hope to get justice from the HC,” he added.

When asked about the perception of PFI being an extremist organisation and that its funding was considered suspicious, Salam said, ""PFI only works for India and gets funding from India."" On public disclosure of its sources of funding, Salam said, “We are a registered organisation and all details about our funds are provided in the income tax returns. The IT department would have all our details so we are not hiding anything,” he added.

“To divert the attention of the people from from the police atrocities, the UP police and government are now targeting PFI. PFI state ad-hoc committee convener Wasim Ahmed and committee members Qari Ashfaque and Mohammed Nadeem are arrested on fake charges of planning the violence. This police action in fact seems to be a follow-up of the baseless allegation levelled by state deputy CM that PFI is behind all untoward incidents,” a statement by the organisation read.

“We are very confident that members of our organisation and other activists who are arrested will soon be released through the courts as the UP police will fail miserably to prove the charge against them,” the PFI statement asserts.

TOI reported on Saturday that UP’s request seeking a ban on PFI, coupled with inputs from Assam police pointing to PFI cadres role in fanning the December 11 violence in Guwahati during the anti-CAA protests and a 2017 dossier by NIA detailing PFI activists’ alleged role in four terror cases, have bolstered the Centre’s case for moving afresh to proscribe the outfit.

Sadaf Jafar

LUCKNOW: Activist and actor Sadaf Jafar and former IPS officer S R Darapuri were granted bail on Saturday along with 11 other accused in connection with the violence that erupted during the December 19 protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the city.

The prosecution admitted during arguments that investigations so far had found no clear evidence of Sadaf’s specific role in arson and that an investigation was still under way to collect more evidence.

Additional district judge S S Pandey, while granting bail, considered the prosecution’s admission that they lacked proof of Sadaf’s role in arson and took cognisance of the medical reports of police personnel injured during the protests, stating “it was evident the injuries were not grievous in nature”. The court directed the accused to furnish two sureties of Rs 50,000 each and a personal bond.

The court in its order on Sadaf stated: “The accused will cooperate and appear before the investigating officer as and when required and will not participate in any criminal activity or influence witnesses. Without going into the merits of the case and considering the nature of offences and circumstances of the case, the grounds for bail are enough.”

Sadaf was arrested from the anti-CAA protest site at Lucknow’s Parivartan Chowk on the evening of December 19 while she was live-streaming events. Later, an FIR was lodged against 33 people, including Sadaf, at Hazratganj police station. Before her arrest, she posted critical videos accusing police of inaction during the clashes. Those who got bail on Saturday also included a Rae Bareli-based lecturer and activist, Pawan Rai Ambedkar.

In her bail petition, filed with the assistance of senior advocate Harjot Singh, Sadaf said police nabbed her while she was filming the violence and helping cops identify miscreants. She also said police had not been able to find evidence of her involvement in the violence.

Government lawyer Deepak Yadav , while opposing the bail plea, said Sadaf violated prohibitory orders and was arrested from the spot where violence was taking place. Sadaf was charged with rioting, attempt to murder, assault, criminal intimidation, disobedience of a public servant, voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant, arson and criminal conspiracy under various sections of the IPC, Sec 3/4 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act of 1984 and Section 7 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1932.

NEW DELHI: Citing the attack on Sikh pilgrims at Nankana Sahib in Pakistan, BJP on Saturday claimed the incident justifies the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“Those sitting on dharna in Shaheen Bagh or staging protests in other parts of the country like Kerala against CAA should take a cue from the Nankana Sahib incident about how minorities are unsafe in the neighbouring countries,” BJP spokesperson and Lok Sabha MP Meenakshi Lekhi said. Lekhi said the Nankana Sahib incident is an illustration of the kind of persecution minorities in Pakistan face and why they need citizenship in India.

Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the violent mob that besieged the Nankana Sahib Gurdwara on Friday had threatened to change the name of the holy place to “Ghulam-e-Mustafa”. “Do those who are opposing the CAA need more evidence of oppression of minorities in Pakistan,” he asked.

Lekhi also questioned Navjot Singh Sidhu ’s silence on the incident. “I do not know where Sidhu paaji has fled? Even if after all this, he wants to hug ISI chief, then Congress should look into it,” Lekhi said.

Kolkata: Two persons, including a senior citizen, were killed and six were seriously injured in four accidents in the city between Friday afternoon and Saturday morning.

A 73-year-old man from Hazra Road was run over by a minibus when the vehicle skidded on the rain-soaked road around 8.30pm on Friday.

Protesters say for a turn at a distance of 250 metres, they have to take a U-turn 1.5km away

Rajkot: Angry with e-memos issued by traffic police for wrong side driving, 100-odd commuters staged a chakka jam (road block) in front of Juna Kuvadava Road police station near fruit market in Rajkot on Saturday. At least 21 protesters were detained by the police.

The commuters, mostly labourers earning daily wages, were extremely incensed when they received e-memos each worth Rs 1,500.

Most of them complained that they were issued e-memos for driving on the wrong side on Juna Kuvadava Road.

“If we have to go towards Greenland Chowkadi or Navagam from Juna Kuvadava Road, we have to take the U-turn that comes after one and a half kilometre near Patel Vihar. However, if we drive in the wrong side, we can take the turn after driving for just 200-250 metres,” explained one of the commuters.

“Most of us are daily wagers belonging to the lowest rung of the society, and if we have to pay Rs 1,500 for an e-memo, how will we survive. We can’t afford that burden. Hence, when we received the memos, we had no option but to stage a chakka jam to register our protest,” said another commuter.

The road block resulted in huge traffic jam with scores of vehicles lining up to 2.5km for nearly two hours. The agitators also raised slogans against the traffic police before they were detained. The 21 agitators detained were and booked them for rioting also.

RAJKOT: Her addiction to gambling made this simple housewife turn into a thief, said police on Saturday. Cops arrested Ekta Bhimani, a resident of Bhaktinagar in Rajkot , from her parental home in Satya Apartment at Nikol in Ahmedabad on Friday.

Ekta had allegedly stolen gold jewellery worth Rs 5.6 lakh from her trader husband, Ankit Bhimani’s house and had also pawned it at a financial firm to avail money to pay off her debts before fleeing to her parents’ house.

During interrogation, Ekta confessed to being addicted to gambling after she came in contact with her aunt-in-law in Rajkot, who was a habitual gambler.

“During Shravan, Ekta lost Rs 15 lakh to Alka, wife of Imran Menu, in gambling. As she did not have money to pay the amount, she decided to steal the jewellery along with the jewellery that her parents had gifted her for her wedding,” said an official from Bhaktinagar police station.

PATNA: The East Central Railways (ECR) is likely to start ro-ro (roll-on/roll-off) service between Sheikhpura and Tilrath in Begusarai from February.

A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting between the officials of the state transport department and the ECR earlier this week. According to them, loaded trucks will now be directly carried by railway wagons to their destinations.

Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal told this newspaper on Saturday that the ro-ro service will reduce the movement of heavy vehicles on the J P Setu between Digha and Sonepur.

“Traffic on the J P Setu has doubled after a ban was imposed on the movement of heavy vehicles on the Rajendra Setu in Begusarai in December last year. The National Highways Authority of India had taken the decision in view of the bridge’s dilapidated condition,” Agarwal said and added the district transport officers would provide certificates, stating the weight of the trucks to be carried by railway wagons.

At the recent meeting between transport department and ECR officials, it was decided that ro-ro services would also be started between Mokama and Begusarai and Bihta and Begusarai soon.

Sources claimed that the ECR would provide the necessary infrastructure and facilities for starting the ro-ro service.

ECR’s chief freight traffic manager, Sanjay Kumar, said special ramps to load and unload trucks and lorries would also be made available at Sheikhpura and Tilrath.

“We are trying to reduce the pressure on the J P Setu by introducing ro-ro service from February. The cost of transportation depends on the distance covered, but it usually costs anywhere between Rs 3,000 and Rs 4,000 per truck of 15 tonnes,” Kumar added.

Earlier, in 2016, the ECR had started ro-ro service between Bihta and Turki in Muzaffarpur . It was, however, stopped after some time.

PATNA: Police on Saturday arrested two students of Patna University (PU) from two hostels for their alleged involvement in the attack on two constables, Santosh Kumar and Rajesh Paswan, at Krishna Ghat under the Pirbahore police station area in the city on Thursday.

He said Pratyush and Alok were inmates of Patna University’s Minto Hostel and Jackson Hostel, respectively. The SHO added that Pratush was an accused in a murder case lodged with Pirbahore police station. “He had recently come out of jail on bail. The injured constables and some eyewitnesses had identified the two PU students,” the SHO said.

SI’s stolen pistol yet to be recovered: Police have so far not been able to recover the service pistol, seven bullets and cellphone of sub-inspector Chandrayan Marandi (58) which were stolen after he fell unconscious following an accident near Gosaitola sump house under the Patliputra police station area in the city on December 1 last year.

53,['5/01/2020'],"Faiz was born, studied and married in India. To call him Pakistani is a misnomer, says his grandson Ali Madeeh Hashmi","With Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s 1979 poem Hum Dekhenge becoming the subject of a controversy, Sonam Joshi spoke to Lahore-based psychologist Ali Madeeh Hashmi, who is Faiz’s grandson and author of his authorised biography

What is your reaction to IIT Kanpur setting up a panel to investigate whether your grandfather’s poem is “anti-national”?

How do you think Faiz would have reacted?

The IIT professor’s complaint relates to two specific lines: Jab arz-e-Khuda ke kaabe se/Sab but uthwaye jayenge” and “Bas naam rahega Allah ka”. Could you put these in context?

A lot of articles refer to Faiz as a Pakistani poet. How strong were his ties with India?

Why do you think Faiz’s poetry continues to remain relevant nearly 35 years after his death?

From being imprisoned for four years during the 1950s to living in exile in Beirut from 1978-82, what was Faiz’s relationship to the state?

The reaction is mainly amusement, or perhaps bemusement might be a better word. While we have, for a long time, been used to certain aspects of Faiz’s poetry being censored or outright banned in Pakistan, to have it happen in India is rather astonishing. As to whether the poem is ‘anti-national’, yes, it absolutely is. Faiz was not a ‘nationalist’; he was an ‘internationalist’, a believer in the ideal of the people of the Indo-Pak subcontinent being brothers and sisters, who needed to make common cause against their enemies. Not just that, he linked the struggle of our people to the struggle of common people all over the world for justice, economic and political equality. It is a pity that a prestigious institution like IIT Kanpur has initiated this ludicrous inquiry. But this has given us, the Faiz family, a chance, once again to declare unequivocally that we stand, not just with the ordinary people of Pakistan but of India as well. The struggle of the students of Jamia, AMU and IIT is our struggle too.With his verse: ‘Kat te bhi chalo badhte bhi chalo baazu bhi bahut hain sar bhi/bahut chalte bhi chalo ki ab dere manzil hi pe daale jayenge’ (Let the amputations begin/The Hydra of our resolve, our revolution/Bears many arms, wears many heads... We will rest only when we’ve reached our Motherland’s true court).Faiz used a lot of religious imagery and symbolism in many of his poems and these two lines refer to (a) the Prophet Muhammad’s breaking the idols inside the ‘Ka’aba’, revered as the House of Allah and (b) referring to the concept of ‘Tauheed’, or oneness of God, a core belief in Islam. As a monotheist religion, Islam sets itself in opposition to polytheistic belief systems and ‘but-shikan’ (‘idol-breaker’) is often thought of as a person who upends traditional values and beliefs to usher in a new era. But ‘idol’ in poetic parlance can mean any number of things: a cruel beloved, a tyrannical ruler, or even one’s own self which must be cleansed of impurities to achieve union with the divine. We are surprised that the IIT professor who filed this complaint is not familiar with this elementary fact. Perhaps IIT Kanpur should add a course in poetry and the humanities to its curriculum.Well, ‘Pakistani’ is a misnomer. He was born in 1911 in India, went to school and college in India, started his first job in Amritsar , got married in Srinagar in 1941 and fought in the Indian Army in the Second World War. He only became ‘Pakistani’ when he was 36, in 1947. And all his life, he retained a deep love and affection for the people who live in what is now ‘India’. He never saw the ordinary people of both countries as separate and certainly not as enemies. He never became embroiled in the rather superfluous debate about whether Partition was ‘right’ or ‘wrong’, and he never bought into the ‘us against them’ narrative either.He answered that himself and the exact quote is ‘Bhai, na Pakistan ke halaat badlain gay, na hamari nazmain purani hongi’ (‘Neither will Pakistan’s conditions change, nor will my poems age’). Professor sahib at IIT Kanpur along with PM Modi-ji are proving that the same applies to India as well.In 2016, MAMI festival banned the screening of a movie he wrote, and two years later, your mother was not allowed to attend an event in Delhi after being invited. Why does Faiz rankle the establishment?Because his poems challenge tyranny and oppression, and since he has not situated his poems in a particular time or situation, they resonate with all people who are struggling for justice and equality.He was not against state authority as such, only against the oppressive authority of states. You have to remember that for Faiz and many of the stalwarts of the All India Progressive Writer’s Association, India’s freedom struggle from the British was also a struggle for economic and social equality. What they wanted was not just an end to British rule but an end to tyranny and exploitation. When that didn’t happen in either India or Pakistan, Faiz felt the work of Independence was incomplete.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73102099,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-144776,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/faiz-was-born-studied-and-married-in-india-to-call-him-pakistani-is-a-misnomer/articleshow/73102066.cms

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar at Khagaria on Saturday

PATNA/BEGUSARAI/KHAGARIA: Playing down the issue of the Jal Jivan Hariyali tableau failing to make the cut for the Republic Day Parade, CM Nitish Kumar said on Saturday that he believes in work, not publicity .

“Hum Prachar me Nai, Balki Kam Mein Vishwas Rakhte hain,” Nitish said in Begusarai while addressing a public gathering on the first day of the sixth phase of his JJH Yatra.

He added: “Some people are unnecessarily talking about the proposed theme of JJH for our tableau not being showcased in the Republic Day parade. There is no meaning of such questions. There are many other works being done in different parts of the country, which will be showcased in the Republic Day Parade. Many things associated with Bihar have also been shown at the parades in the past. There is no need to worry about it.”

Nitish appealed to the people of the state to ensure their participation in the human chain being organised by the state government on January 19 to spread awareness on JJH, anti-dowry, anti-child marriage and liquor prohibition initiatives. The 16,200km human chain initiative aims to cover the entire state.

“Only those who understand the concept of JJH will adopt it and we will work together to make it successful,” Nitish said.

Nitish also mentioned Microsoft founder Bill Gates appreciating the JJH work being done in Bihar, even as many developed countries such as France, England and US are still not taking climate change seriously.

The CM visited Saadpur panchayat in Sahebpurkamal block and reviewed various projects related to rejuvenating village water bodies, plantation and rain water harvesting schemes. He also inspected a revamped pond spread across 22acres with intensive plantation all around it.

He also inaugurated a new government school building built at a cost of over Rs1 crore. The CM met members of women’s self- help groups (SHGs) and handed over cheques worth over 19 crore for their capacity building.

From Begusarai, Nitish went to Khagaria in the afternoon, where he laid the foundation for 250 development schemes worth Rs 2,200 crore during a 'Jagrukta Sammelan' at Telihar village under Beldaur block in Khagaria district. The CM also inaugurated 126 schemes worth Rs73 crore for the district.

Three RJD functionaries arrested in Begusarai: At least three district functionaries of RJD were arrested in Begusarai for trying to create disturbances at the CM’s public meeting held as part of the ‘Jal Jivan Haryali’ campaign on Saturday.

Police said district president of RJD, Mohit Yadav, Youth RJD’s Ram Krishna Patel and student’s wing leader Kailash Yadav were taken into custody while proceeding towards the venue of the CM’s meeting with banners and placards against the CAA.

A team led by SDPO Sanjiv Kumar intercepted them. Earlier, they had organized a protest march against the CAA at Balia in Begusarai district .

The SHO of Town police station, Amrendra Kumar Jha, said RJD functionaries were arrested with banners and posters against CAA. A case was lodged against them for causing hindrance in discharge of official duty and other sections of IPC.

Upendra Kumar Sharma

PATNA: The 2008 batch IPS officer, Upendra Kumar Sharma , who took charge as Patna ’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) on Thursday, has made it clear that crime against women will not be tolerated. In an interview with TOI’s Sheezan Nezami, he talks about his priorities. Excerpts:

What will be your priority as the SSP of Patna?

As a police official, crime control and maintenance of law and order are my duties. However, issues like crime against women, dowry death , murder, dacoity, communal tension, loot and chain snatching will be given top priority and dealt with seriously. The deputy superintendent of police will be asked to supervise such cases.

Earlier, you were posted as the City SP. Is there a difference in the nature of crimes then and now?

The only difference is that social media and cybercrime had not spread their tentacles back then. Besides, movies, which portray harassers as heroes, have polluted the minds of youngsters today. A number of them hail from well-to-do families and are not involved in crimes for fulfilling their basic needs. Instead, they want to buy expensive cellphones and gadgets.

What steps will you take to strengthen your team and set an example for other districts?

We will ensure that innocent people, especially youngsters, are not sent to jail as it can ruin their future. We will try to maintain transparency and reach a crime spot on time.

Crime against women is a major concern everywhere. How will you deal with complaints of sexual harassment, eve-teasing and stalking?

Crime against women will not be tolerated. I urge women and young girls to be strong and come forward to lodge FIRs.

Patna is a hub of private coaching institutes. Some girls, who come here from distant places to peruse higher education, often fall prey to harassment. How will you ensure their safety?

As of now, I have not visited any such area, but will do so soon. We will identify the vulnerable areas and ensure the presence of cops there.

Can Patnaites freely go outside without having to worry about their cash, jewellery and other costly items at home?

This is a major challenge for us, but we will keep an eye on theft and dacoity accused who have been set free after serving jail term. We will also try to ensure that the number of such cases goes down.

Under construction site at the upcoming nature safari at Rajgir

PATNA: Adventure-lovers from the state now need not go to Rishikesh to enjoy zip-lining or flying fox activities, as the state environment, forest and climate change department is coming up with various recreational amenities in the upcoming nature safari at Rajgir in Nalanda district .

The nature safari, spread over an area of around 500hectare, is located in Jethian valley between Rajgir-Jethian pathways. Department’s principal secretary Dipak Kumar Singh said the motive behind developing the nature safari is to bring people close to nature and make them realize its importance. “Most of us hardly find time to observe nature and spend some time amid trees and birds. Rajgir Nature Safari is being developed for this purpose,” Dipak told TOI.

Conservator of forests, Patna division, Gopal Singh said there will be facility of unpaved path, which will be used for walking inside the safari. “Another attraction will be canopy walkways or treetop walkways, in which bridges will be made between the treetops and people can enjoy the scenery from the top and get a view of the surrounding. There will be a butterfly zone and relaxation sheds,” he said.

People will also be able to camp in the midst of nature as the forest department will provide tent houses. “Accommodation facility is being developed on raised platforms with capacity to accommodate 100 people at any given time,” said the forest official.

Sources associated with the project said that minimum construction work is being done to avoid any adverse impact on the green cover. As of now, almost 20% of the work has been completed, which includes demarcation of the area, putting up gates and identification of area for putting up tents. The hills, which will have 300-metre-long zip-lining facility, have also been selected and soil testing process has been completed for the same. The project is expected to be completed by March next year.

“Since the nature safari is coming at a distance of 4km from the upcoming zoo safari in Rajgir, tourists will be able to visit both the facilities without travelling much,” said Gopal. The zoo safari, spread across 480 acre is expected to get completed in August this year. Animals in this safari will be kept in big enclosures and people will be taken around in closed vehicles to see them.

Jaiswal, on the other hand, said party functionaries and workers will go to more than 3 crore houses in the state to apprise people about CAA and inform them that that the law does not take away citizenship of any Indian, rather it only grants persecuted minorities from four select countries the Indian citizenship. “Some opposition parties are misleading the minorities,” Jaiswal said at Motihari.

Surat: Three children were attacked by leopards at different locations of south Gujarat in the past four days, resulting in death of two of them. The three children of sugarcane farm labourers were attacked by the leopards near their huts in open fields.

Kishan Pintu Vadvi, 5, was declared dead during treatment in a hospital on Saturday afternoon. He was attacked at around 9am in a sugarcane farm near Bharan village of Anleshwar taluka in Bharuch district. The big cat caught the boy and began to drag him when some labourers shouted and chased it. The leopard left the boy and escaped. Vadvi suffered injuries in neck and shoulder. His body was sent for postmortem at Kim Civil Hospital. Vadvi’s family had come from Rapapor village of Nandurbar district in Maharashtra to work in the fields.

On Thursday at around 7pm, Shivani Shankar Mahla, 4, was attacked by a leopard in a sugarcane farm near Patal village of Mandvi taluka in Surat district. The girl was playing near her hut when the leopard attacked her. It was trying to drag her into nearby bushes when her mother returned after fetching water. She chased the leopard which left the child and escaped from the spot. Mahla family was handed over a cheque of Rs4 lakh by the state government as compensation for the girl who died on Saturday. Mahla family had come to work in sugarcane farms with other labourers from Madalbari village of Dang district.

Earlier on Wednesday, Lalsing Keshar Malche, 7, a resident of Navapur in Maharashtra, was attacked by a leopard in a farm near Areth village of Mandvi taluka in Surat district at around 7pm. The leopard tried to bite the child’s head and drag him. Some labourers were successful in chasing away the leopard. Some hair and skin from the child’s head got peeled off. Malche is under treatment at a hospital and his health is stable, forest officials said.

“Seven teams with three forest officials in each team are camping near Bharan village and seven cages have been placed to cage the leopard. We have started the process to pay a compensation of Rs4 lakh to the victim’s family,” said K Shashikumar, chief conservator of forests, Bharuch.

“We have instructed villagers and sugar factories to shift labourers to safer locations near the villages. So far, we have shifted 20 families of labourers to safer locations to prevent attacks on them,” said Puneet Nayyar, deputy conservator of forests, Surat.

No compensation paid to injured boy

Lalsing Keshar Malche, who suffered head injuries when he was attacked by a leopard near Areth village of Mandvi on Wednesday, is yet to receive any compensation from the state government. The boy is under treatment at a hospital. “We are yet to pay compensation to the boy. It will be paid soon,” said Puneet Nayyar, DCF, Surat.

Sugarcane labourers easy target

Sugarcane labourers come from tribal areas of south Gujarat and Maharashtra in the harvest season. They build their huts with plastic sheets and bamboo sticks in the farms. They keep moving from one farm to another and villages in groups until the harvest season lasts. This has been the practice since decades for harvesting of sugarcanes by sugar factories in south Gujarat. “After lion poaching case of 2007 in Saurashtra, Gujarat government had issued a directive making ‘pucca’ shelter mandatory for labourers sleeping in the farm. However, this directive only exists on paper,” experts say.

Patal is just 12km away from Vareli

Patal village of Mandvi taluka in Surat where a four-year-old girl was killed by a leopard is 12km from Vareli village where a leopard was shot dead in 2011 after it turned man-eater. Twelve humans died in 2010-11 in leopard attacks while six leopards were killed during the same period by humans.

Govt officials to discuss leopard attacks on Jan 6

Ahmedabad: Senior officers of forest department and other government departments will discuss leopard attacks in a meeting to be held in Gandhinagar on Monday. Sugarcane farmers and mill owners will also attend the emergency meeting which has been convened after a series of leopard attacks in the districts of south Gujarat.

“We will ensure that labourers coming from other states or other parts of Gujarat get proper shelter. Usually these labourers are made to sleep in the open. This makes them easy prey for the leopards,” said Gujarat minister for forests and environment Ganpat Vasava in Gandhinagar on Saturday. He added that the state government will be setting up one rescue centre each in Surat and Dang to house the captured leopards. So far, 60 leopards have been caged in south Gujarat of whom 25 were involved in attack on humans.

62,['5/01/2020'],Corpn’s multiple-tray aerators to be operational in a month,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Trichy: The trial run of the multiple-tray aerators established by the Trichy Corporation at Srirangam to improve the quality of drinking water was conducted recently and following its success, the facility is going to be inaugurated in a month. Since complaints were raised by residents about the poor quality of the water supply, the civic body opted to install multiple-tray aerators to reduce the high iron content in the drinking water by oxidizing the dissolved metals before supplying to the households.

Two collector wells of the corporation located over the Kollidam river bed have been catering to the drinking water needs of Ponmalai and Ariyamangalam zones. Recently, Ponmalaipatti locals under Ponmalai zone raised complaints about the poor quality and brownish colour of the water supplied through the pipelines. But such complaints did not surface in K Abishekapuram and Srirangam zones. The civic body studying the water quality supplied to Ponmalai had found that high iron content from the collector well I and collector well II on Kollidam river bed was causing water colour to change.

To overcome the trouble, the civic body along with the TWAD board and commissionerate of municipal administration (CMA) opted for the aerator facility for treating the water. Subsequently, in June 2019, the corporation launched the civil work for the multiple-tray aerators at a cost of Rs 1 crore. The aerators established for a diameter of 12 metres is a fountain-like structure, which will bring the water extracted directly in the contact of air, causing the oxidization process that will remove the high iron content in the water.

“90% of the installation work is over and the trial run was satisfactory with the aerators managing to remove the high iron content in the water,” an official source said. The 60 MLD capacity aerators, established between the two collector wells and a major sump to treat the water, were designed by the TWAD board. Though similar aerator facilities were established in Coimbatore, Dindigul and Theni districts, the corporation sources said that aerators are massive in terms of the water capacity.

Bhopal: After onions, it is the turn of tomatoes. Tomato prices are now threatening to derail the household budget. Owing to widespread damage to the crop following prolonged cold wave and hailstorms that have hit Madhya Pradesh, the prices of tomato have gone up threefold from Rs10 to Rs30 per kilogram in the last one week.

Tomato crops have been damaged in most parts of the state as well as the country. The damage is 30% to 90%, depending on the district and the weather condition. Many farmers have started uprooting the plants to prepare the farm for sowing onions or some other vegetables.

For the past many days, the state has been reeling under intense cold wave conditions. The farmers tried to protect their crops by lighting bonfire but in vain, said Mahendra Singh, a big farmer in Shivpuri district.

“ I have not been able to save my crop and the damage has been extensive. Almost 90% of the tomato crop has been damaged. There was hardly any sunlight for days together which damaged the the crop”, he said. A crate carrying 22 kilogram to 25 kilogram of tomato is now being sold at Rs500, he said, adding that the prices are likely to go up further in the upcoming days once the present stock in mandis across the state is exhausted.

Shivpuri is located in Gwalior division and is close to Sheopur district of Chambal division. This region is facing an extremely harsh winter , which is having an adverse impact on tomato crop. In Chhindwara district, farmers have started uprooting the tomato plants. “There has been more than 50% damage to the crop”, said Lakshman Markan, a local farmer. Mahendra Hapad, another farmer in Jhabua, said: “Almost 30% of the crop has been damaged and I have lost all hopes to protect the crop as the weather continues to remain adverse”.

Rajendra Singh, a vegetable wholesaler in Bhopal, said: “Tomato prices are surging and the rise in prices will continue in the coming days too.”

ARA: First additional district and sessions judge-cum-special judge for POCSO cases R K Singh on Friday ordered attachment of immovable property of RJD ’s Sandesh MLA Arun Kumar Yadav.

Arun, accused in a case related to sexual exploitation of a minor girl, is on the run. Special public prosecutor for POCSO cases Saroj Kumari said the court has asked the Bhojpur DM and the SP to attach the immovable property of the accused MLA.

Earlier on September 13, the court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against the MLA. As he did not surrender, the police seized the MLA’s movable property at his village, Lasadhi, on September 22.

Police have already arrested four accused in the case and filed chargesheet against them. The Sandesh MLA, however, is still at large.

Police sources said the minor girl was thrown into sex racket in Patna by a woman, Anita Devi, who lured her on the pretext of providing education and employment. Anita has already been arrested by the police.

PATNA: The daylight murder of an undertrial prisoner in the Hajipur district jail on Friday could have provided a good ‘masala (plot)’ for a Hindi blockbuster movie. Under a well-hatched conspiracy, a local ‘goonda’ was hired by a professional criminal, facilitated to go inside the prison on charges of committing a petty offence and finally the ‘target’ was hit with a 9mm pistol from a point blank range, leading to his instant death.

After unsuccessful bid on the life of a 30-year-old undertrial prisoner Manish Kumar alias Teliya earlier in May last year, the alleged mastermind behind the first-of-its-kind murder inside the four walls of the prison, Anu Singh (26), also an accused in the infamous 2017-gold loot case in Rajasthan’s Jaipur, changed his strategy to eliminate a member of the interstate gang led by one Subodh Singh of which he also once happened to be a part.

Anu, a resident of Rambhadra Nagar locality under the Hajipur town police station in Vaishali district, was unhappy with the deceased, Manish Kumar, for allegedly siphoning off a lion’s share in the loot of around 90kg of gold from two different places at Jaipur in Rajasthan, Asansol and Barrackpore in West Bengal and Nagpur in Maharashtra in the last couple of years.

Anu had promised Rs 10 lakh to the shooter, Raja Babu, a resident of Tisiauta in Vaishali district, for killing Manish inside the jail on Friday. During interrogation, Raja said the weapon, which was used in the killing of the undertrial prisoner, was provided to him by Anu. Raja was sent to jail on charges of plotting robbery under Garaul police station area of the district on November 2 last year.

“Anu was keeping a close eye on Manish ever since the latter survived the murderous attack on him on the Hajipur civil court premises in May last year,” Raja told the interrogators.

According to Hajipur sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Raghav Dayal, Anu also had grudge against Manish for ‘leaking’ information to the senior officers of the special task force (STF), which led to the killing of three of the gang members in an encounter near Hasanpur diara under the Mahnar police station area in Vaishali district in March last year.

Those killed in the police encounter were identified as Manish Singh alias Ranveer, a resident of Raghopur (Vaishali), Md Abdul Imran alias Raj Kumar, a native of Muzaffarpur and Md Abdul Aman alias Tiwari from Samastipur. An AK-47 assault rifle, a Bareta pistol, a revolver and live cartridges were seized from the encounter site.

Police investigations revealed that nine people have so far been killed in Vaishali district alone due to differences over distribution of share among the members of interstate gang in the loot of about 90kg of gold from Rajasthan, West Bengal and Maharashtra since 2016.

Police sources said a noted marble dealer, Sushil Kumar Singh (45), was shot dead in front of his shop near Paswan Chowk under the Hajipur Industrial police station on March 15 last year. A close relative of a mukhiya Mukesh Singh was also killed recently. The third murder took place in Bengaluru. “All the three were killed allegedly by the goons of Anu Singh for duping the latter of money which they had promised to give him after selling the gold earlier looted from different parts of the country,” a senior police officer said on the condition of anonymity.

During interrogation, Anu confessed to the crime and disclosed that five-six more people were on his hit list for duping him of money. A fresh case has been lodged with the Hajipur sadar police station against Anu and his accomplish Raja in connection with Friday’s prisoner murder case.

Manish, a resident of Teliya village under Rajapakar police station in Vaishali district, was arrested by the Bidupur police in a case lodged under various sections of Arms Act and Excise and Prohibition Act on February 5, 2019.

SHO of Hajipur sadar police station Rohan Kumar said, “In May last year, Manish had survived a murderous attack when he was taken to the local civil court for appearance in a case. Two police personnel had suffered serious injuries in the firing then. The name of Anu had also figured in the attempt to murder case.”

Anu was brought to Hajipur from Rajasthan’s Jaipur for his appearance in a case last year. However, the mastermind of the gold loot cases outside the state, Binod Singh, and a few other members of the gang are still lodged in the Jaipur jail, police sources said.

Jailer among five cops suspended: Five police personnel, including Hajipur jailer Yunush, have been put under suspension for dereliction of duty. IG (prison) Mithilesh Mishra said a probe is underway to ascertain how the illegal weapon got inside the Hajipur district jail to eliminate an undertrial prisoner. “A special team has been set up to look into the matter,” Mishra added.

The deceased were identified as Shila Devi (36), Praveen Kumar (6) and six-month-old Manju. SHO of Bajpatti police station Ajay Kumar Mishra said the other two kids of Kamlesh, who were also in the room at the time of the incident, had a narrow escape.

According to police sources, Kamlesh would often fight with his wife and other family members. The incident came to light around 6am on Saturday when Kamlesh tried to escape from home when his family members confronted him.

Sitamarhi SP Anil Kumar said Kamlesh killed his wife, son and daughter between 12am and 1am after a fight with his wife. “He used a sharp weapon to kill his wife and kids when they were asleep. First he stabbed his wife to death and then slit the throat of one of his sons, Praveen, when he tried to raise an alarm. Kamlesh also strangled his six-month-old daughter,” the SP added.

“Kamlesh has no medical history. Prima facie, it appears the incident was the result of a family dispute. According to family members, Kamlesh is of violent nature who would often beat his wife and others in the family,” the SP said.

Police have recovered the weapon used in the crime. A forensic science laboratory team Muzaffarpur has collected samples from the pot for investigation.

“Kamlesh’s another son Naveen Kumar (10) and daughter Sapna (11) were also in the room when the incident occurred. They are in shock after the incident,” the SHO said.

He added that Kamlesh had warned them not to make noise or else he would kill them too. “Around 6am when Kamlesh’s brother tried to wake him up, there was no noise from inside the room. The family members broke open the window and were shocked to find bodies of Shila and her two kids. Kamlesh tried to escape when his brother raised alarm. However, the villagers caught hold of him. He was later handed over to police,” the SHO said.

Locals protesting against the desecration of Gandhiji’s statue at Lathi on Saturday

RAJKOT: Mischief mongers in Lathi town in Amreli district allegedly desecrated a statue of Mahatma Gandhi on Friday night.

Bapu’s statue was one among the many statues erected by Dholakia foundation at the Hari Krishna lake. After knowing about the vandalism, the administer of the foundation made a representation to the police urging it to increase vigil and arrest the antisocial elements.

The vandalism also irked the farmers and traders of the locality. The caretaker of the garden, Kanu Patel told TOI: “The antisocial elements broke the statue into 13 pieces. This is not the first time. A few months ago too miscreants damaged the statue of former president Dr Abdul Kalam. They also uprooted nearly 100 plants. We are tired of these vandals and want police to take strong action against them.”

This garden has been developed by Surat diamantaire Savji Dholakia in 600 bigha land. Dholakia hails from Dudhala village located 2km away from Lathi. Dholakia foundation has been managing the public garden which has no entry gate. Even the forest department celebrated the Van Mahotsav here. Plantation of tress have been done on 300 bigha land, while the remaining land has statues of various gods and goddesses along with eminent personalities.

The foundation has accused the police of not taking the issue of repeated vandalism seriously. Talking to media persons, sub inspector of Lathi police station, V P Gohil said, “We will soon nab the perpetrators and increase patrolling in nearby areas.”

PATNA: Vehicular movement on the much-awaited Digha-AIIMS elevated highway is likely to begin from March this year. One lane of the 11.9km road will, however, become operational from February, said Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, managing director of Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited (BSRDCL), the executing agency of the project.

While the first 2km of the road starting from AIIMS-Patna is a two-lane semi-elevated road, the remaining stretch is elevated four-lane road.

The road, which will connect J P Setu in Digha, will not just reduce travelling time but also act as connectivity for people going to Sonepur from Phulwarisharif or AIIMS in southern parts of the city.

“After the construction of the elevated road, vehicles coming from north Bihar will have a hassle-free journey,” a BSRDCL official said.

The ambitious project, which entails an expenditure of Rs 1,231.06 crore, was initially targeted to be completed by March 2018. Chief minister Nitish Kumar had launched the project in November 2013. A BSRDCL official said the delay was due to financial problems faced by the agency responsible for the construction of Digha-AIIMS elevated road.

Sanjay Kumar, chief general manager of BSRDCL said more than 97% of the construction work was complete. “The remaining 3% work will be completed as soon as Gammon India, the firm responsible for construction work, resolves its financial issues. The process will not take more than two months,” he said.

Meanwhile, BSRDCL officials also said that construction of a railway overbridge (ROB) at Khagaul was another cause for the delay. “We have got the no-objection certificate from the railways for the construction of ROB on the eastern side of existing ROB at Khagaul. Train movement on the tracks may be affected during the construction period,” said BSRDCL MD Agarwal.

Meanwhile, a 12.27km-long two-lane road has been constructed underneath the Digha-AIIMS elevated road along the Digha-Danapur canal. The road serves as connectivity for people coming from Phulwarisharif or AIIMS and going to Digha.

KOLKATA: A little more than two years after he attacked a warden of Alipore central jail and slashed his throat, Mohammad Masiuddin alias Musa — who was earlier questioned by FBI for his alleged links with the Islamic State (IS) and who remains one of the top security threats in Kolkata — carried out a similar attack on the head warder of Presidency Correctional Home on Saturday morning. He later claimed all his actions so far have been “pious”.Police said Musa, from Birbhum’s Labhpur, assaulted Amal Karmakar around 11am inside the high-security cell 7. “Musa attacked Karmakar with a PVC pipe that was fitted to the outlet of a basin inside cell 7. The on-duty head warder sustained severe head injuries and had to be treated at the jail hospital. He was later discharged. Doctors, however, have asked him to be admitted to a government facility and remain under observation for some time,” a jail official said. He added that at the time of the attack, Musa was scheduled to be taken out for a morning walk.“On the basis of letter of complaint by Suprakash Roy, the superintendent of Presidency correctional home, a specific case under IPC sections 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) and 324 (severe hurt) was registered against Musa. He has two cases — an attempt to murder a warden in 2017 and an NIA case pertaining to terror activities — lodged against him. The cases are on trial or are pending before the additional district and sessions judge’s court in Alipore and the chief judge city sessions court respectively,” said DC (South) Meeraj Khalid.The security personnel at the central lock up are now taking no chances even though Musa has been put in solitary confinement. “He is being monitored every minute and the guards have been briefed accordingly,” a source said.Musa is usually brought to any local court in a “convoy” with two to three police vehicles shadowing the police van amidst tight security comprising Kolkata Police commandos. “After Pulwama and the fast-changing geo-politics in Kashmir, we don’t wish to take any chances till our proposals are accepted,” said a jail department official.In July 2016, CID arrested Musa with help from GRP at Burdwan station while he was travelling in the Howrah-Viswabharati Fast Passenger train. Cops had also seized a firearm and a knife from him.After CID took over the case, investigators found that Musa was planning to kill people in Birbhum. He confessed that he was in touch with some of the IS handlers since 2014 through various chat platforms, networking sites and apps. Gradually, he had recruited a few members in India and became their handler.In its final charge sheet, NIA said Musa and his aides had planned to send signals about the presence of IS in India. They had also identified locations, like Mother House in Kolkata, to target foreign tourists. During interrogation, Musa never showed any remorse or repentance.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73104945,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-505780,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/musa-attacks-jail-warder-with-pipe-gets-solitary-confinement/articleshow/73102998.cms

Trichy: A model urinal complex set up by Trichy corporation behind the Central bus stand here has been remaining inaccessible to the public despite it being much touted as emulating a success story in the national capital. The result: passengers arriving at the bus stand continue to urinate along the compound walls of the two-wheeler parking lot.

“Most of the time, the urinal either remains locked or unmaintained. This forces the passengers to pee along the bus stand’s compound wall,” S Sivakumar, a TNSTC employee said. It was in January 2018 that the corporation installed the compact urinal model for men at the rear entrance of the congested bus stand on VOC road which was in an unhygienic condition because of rampant urination by passengers. Set up at an estimated cost of Rs 5 lakh with the urinal cabin furnished with LED lights and exhaust fans, it was based on a similar one in New Delhi. Unlike the other partially covered urinals for men in the bus stand locality, the model urinals offer privacy as it is completely covered.

The corporation also allowed private companies to display their advertisements atop and on the sides of the urinal and used the revenue to maintain the complex, a first-of-its-kind expenditure model in the city. However, two years down the lane, poor maintenance of the facility and lack of sensitisation among the passengers have rendered the project useless.

Locals of ward 45 falling under K Abishekapuram zone rue that open urination has returned to VOC road after a brief period because of this situation. Though it was meant to be expanded to the other three zones of the civic body, the poor maintenance of the facility has failed to gain public support. “The urinal complex requires maintenance and efforts are under way to make the public facility operational again,” an official source with Trichy corporation told TOI.

77,['5/01/2020'],State IAS officers’ body waits for a chief,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh IAS Officers’ Association is functioning without a president after the resignation of additional chief secretary Gauri Singh.

Singh’s application for voluntary retirement was accepted by the state government on Monday. Office-bearers of the association will now have to elect or nominate a new president, but when this will happen is unclear. Office-bearers of the association declined to say anything on the issue.

The IAS service meet is likely this month. If the association doesn’t get a president by then, it would be probably the first time that the meet will take place with anyone at the helm. Bureaucrats from the entire state attend the meet, which is generally opened by the chief minister.

The Madhya Pradesh IAS Association was in the news thrice last year. In April, it complained against former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to the Election Commission for allegedly threatening the Chhindwara collector after Chouhan’s chopper was denied permission to land after 5pm. In October, it wrote to the chief secretary to express strong resentment against investigating agencies going to the press “without completing investigation”. The trigger for the complaint was believed to be media reports of EOW investigating complaints of alleged corruption in Smart City tenders worth Rs 300 crore, and an IAS officer being named in some reports. And in November 2019, an RTI reply revealed that the MP government had asked the association to pay over Rs 34 lakh in rent dues for its two premises at a posh colony in Bhopal, or face eviction.

78,['5/01/2020'],Pondy bypoll: Cops register case against MLA Johnkumar,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Puducherry: Police registered a case against Congress MLA A Johnkumar on Friday on charges of suppressing information on his assets in an affidavit submitted by him while filing nomination papers to contest the Kamaraj Nagar bypoll in October last year.

The Odiansalai police booked Johnkumar under Section 125-A (penalty for filing false affidavit) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The police action came after chief judicial magistrate V Damodaran directed them to register a case against Johnkumar and launch investigations on December 5 following a petition filed by S Selvamuthurayan.

Johnkumar’s efforts to get the order of the chief judicial magistrate set aside failed as second additional sessions’ judge M Suba Anbumani dismissed his revision petition on December 20. The judge dismissed the petition pointing out that the CJM’s direction is an ‘interlocutory order’ and ‘no revision can be preferred against the interlocutory order’.

Selvamuthurayan in his petition contended that Johnkumar, while filing the affidavit, suppressed details about a 2.4-hectare land bought by him in June 2017. He said Johnkumar started selling the property after converting it into 353 plots and that Johnkumar purposely suppressed information about the property presently valued at more than Rs 4.5 crore in the affidavit.

Selvamuthurayan regretted that the election and police departments failed to initiate any action on their written complaints against Johnkumar in October last. He said he was left with no option but to approach the court requesting a direction to police to register a case against the MLA.

Johnkumar claimed that it was unnecessary to mention the property in question in the affidavit he filed on September 30 last year since he had executed a settlement deed of the property in favour of his daughter on August 15, 2019. He further said the deed has been pending for registration before the Thirukanur sub-registrar since then.

If convicted the MLA can be punished with imprisonment for a term, which may extend to six months, or a fine, or with both.

Johnkumar was elected on a Congress ticket in 2016 from Nellithope. He resigned to enable V Narayanasamy, who did not contest the polls but was elected as the Congress legislature party leader, to contest elections and become chief minister.

He was rewarded for giving up his seat and was nominated as the Congress candidate for the Kamaraj Nagar by-poll in 2019 when the seat became vacant after V Vaithilingam resigned and successfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He secured 14,782 votes and defeated All India NR Congress (AINRC) candidate Bouvanesvarane by 7,170 votes.

Trichy: The city corporation is busy constructing the city’s first smart toilet through a Chennai-based firm as part of efforts to eliminate open urination along Allithurai Road adjacent to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Medical College Hospital (MGMGH). Utilising Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the pay and use toilet facilitates automatic cleaning every 30 minutes.

Corporation sources said that the smart toilet is being established at a cost of Rs 10 lakh. The entire sanitary complex spread over less than 100 square feet is a single slot solid concrete mould, thus making the assembling process swift compared to the conventional reinforced cement concrete construction work. The building can endure all types of weather for at least 50 years and is furnished with LED lights, CCTV cameras and sensors for automatic cleaning. While three urinals and one toilet complex for men are painted blue, the toilet complex for women which is equipped with incinerator and sanitary napkin vending machine is painted pink.

“Once every 30 minutes, there will be a voice announcement about the automatic flushing and cleaning process,” a representative of the firm executing the project said. The toilet is touted to prevent vandalism. If any disruption is made to the facility, the sensors will alert the officials in-charge through IoT devices. Subsequently, the CCTV cameras at the entrance of the complex will capture 20 photographs at a time to identify the accused.

“The pressure pump atop the sanitary complex will enable flushing and cleaning to the required extent for encouraging people to use the facility,” official sources added. Using the urinals is likely to be made free but not the toilets. Sanitary napkin vending machine will provide a napkin for every Rs 5 deposited. Trichy corporation plans to open the sanitary complex in a week. “Such projects should be welcomed but their maintenance and sustainability should be ensured. It should not head the same way as that of the poorly maintained model urinal on VOC road,” S Harish, a resident of Thiruvanaikoil added.

Representative image

MARGAO: The South Goa district and sessions court, Margao, on Saturday, directed the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) to invite Fomento for reconciliation talks in the Sonsoddo matter, if it so intends, within a week.

Fomento is the concessionaire of MMC’s garbage treatment plant (GTP) at Sonsoddo.

If both parties fail to come to the negotiating table to settle the arbitration amount pertaining to termination of the concession agreement, the matter will be heard for final arguments on January 21 by the court.

The prevailing arrangement at Sonsoddo, including that of payment of Rs 1 lakh per day by MMC to Fomento for processing the waste, would continue until further orders, the court said.

MMC’s contention is that the agreement mandates the civic body to cart away only the “excluded waste” while the inerts (post processed residue of nearly 15% of the waste) should go into the sanitary landfill . Fomento has maintained that 900 tonne of rejects lying at the plant is “excluded waste” and should be carted away by the MMC.

The Goa State Pollution Control Board, which was directed by the court to analyse samples of the waste piled up in the GTP at Sonsoddo, is yet to submit its report. The analysis will determine whether the waste constitutes “excluded waste” or “inerts” as defined in the concession agreement between Fomento and MMC. Fomento has submitted the analysis report by a private laboratory.

85,['5/01/2020'],Delhi: Why traders don’t want to shift from Walled City to these two market hubs,"NEW DELHI: A rusted board proclaims that the deserted and broken road leads to Delhi Development Authority’s chemical market in Narela . Inside the 72-acre market complex, single-storey buildings under various stages of construction dot the area, while many structures already built are firmly shut.Conceptualised in 1980, the market is a part of DDA ’s Integrated Freight Corridor (IFC). Divided into two parts, it was created to accommodate chemical traders operating from Tilak Bazaar in Khari Baoli of the Walled City . Apart from the chemical traders, merchants dealing in spices, dry fruits, electrical goods, automobile parts, etc, were also expected to shift to the IFC. The traders, however, are not keen on moving in anytime soon.“The space in Narela is huge compared with the Walled City, but traders are not keen to come here. I have constructed a shop-cum-godown, but I cannot operate from here alone,” said a trader . “The shops came up in the last one year. Power connection and streetlights were provided four months ago. While sewer connections are being provided, there is no water supply,” he added.DDA started allotting the plots to chemical traders in 2001. While 650 plots have been allotted, construction of shop-cum-godowns started just a year ago. Traders had to shut their shops in the Walled City from January 1, 2019, following Delhi high court’s orders.Though most structures are ready or nearing completion, traders said they would not shift till DDA provided the necessary infrastructure.“There are no water and sewer connection. The biggest issue is the lack of security. The area is desolate and you can’t stay here after dark,” said Pradeep Gupta, president, Chemical Merchants Association (CMA). The lack of security is evident from the huge trenches in the vacant plots where soil has been dug up and stolen.Sushil Goel, a CMA member, said DDA created the infrastructure, like roads, in 1996 and it needed to be refurbished. “The 50 square metre plots are not sufficient for storing chemicals. DDA was to auction 200 square metre warehouses, but it hasn’t done so till date,” Goel said.Gupta added that DDA had only allowed single-storey structures, which were not sufficient to build an office and storage facility.“We have arranged for water from Delhi Jal Board and just need to put in place the distribution system,” DDA vice-chairman Tarun Kapoor told TOI. “Pipelines had been laid, but due to erratic construction they got damaged. We will now lay the pipelines again where construction is complete. Water is needed for these shops to get fire clearance,” he added.In another part of the city, Ghazipur IFC, where paper traders from Chawri Bazaar were supposed to shift, is partially operational. Compared with the comparatively smaller shops-cum-godowns in Narela, the two-storeyed buildings constructed by paper traders are imposing. However, even here only half the buildings are open for business.Anil Gupta, secretary of Ghazipur Welfare Association and a member of Paper Merchants Association, tried to set an example by moving in, but now regrets the decision.“I had installed two air-conditioners at a height of 17 feet. Some people came here and beat up the guard and stole the ACs. Security here is a huge concern. The vast area is open from all sides and many streetlights are non-functional,” he said.“People often break into the buildings and steal whatever they can. Also, the stench from the Ghazipur landfill is unbearable,” said Sarvnath Singh, the caretaker of a building.Another trader alleged that goons from nearby areas came every 2-3 months to extort from them.Navin Jain, another trader, said that the market’s location was convenient, but the 400 plots allotted by DDA since 2006 were not enough to accommodate all paper traders of Chawri Bazaar.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73103842,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-150754,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-traders-dont-want-to-shift-from-walled-city-to-these-two-market-hubs/articleshow/73103843.cms

TRICHY: The city police arrested three people including two women on charges of cheating a job aspirant of Rs 1 lakh on the false assurance of getting a job in Singapore, here on Friday.

The airport police arrested S Ramasamy, 52, from Karaikudi in Sivaganga district, his wife R Latha alias Latha Meenakshi, 42, and K Tamil Kodi, 38, from Wireless road, on Friday for cheating G Sathishkumar, 23 of Kamaraj Nagar near airport.

Tamil Kodi had introduced Sathishkumar to Ramasamy and his wife in October 2018. Sathishkumar was an employee at an outsourcing agency at Trichy international airport. Tamil Kodi offered Sathishkumar a job at Ramsamy’s restaurant in Singapore. In his complaint, Sathishkumar alleged that Ramasamy assured to take him to Singapore for employment in his restaurant. He also gave his passport to Ramasamy and deposited Rs 1 lakh in Ramasamy’s account between October and November 2018 in three instalments.

The trio also enacted a drama as if they were processing for his job abroad by taking him to a private hospital in Trichy for his health check-up as a prerequisite for visa process. As there was no response from the trio about the job even after days, Sathishkumar demanded his money back. Although Ramasamy assured to return his money in June 2019, it was not fulfilled.

Sathishkumar alleged that he realised he was taken for a ride when he came to know three colleagues in his company had also paid money to Ramasamy through Tamil Kodi for a job, but were also cheated. The police arrested the three and they were remanded them in judicial custody.

VARANASI: Close on the heels of a controversy over the appointment of a Muslim professor at BHU ’s Sanskrit Vidya Dharm Vigyan faculty, aspirants appearing for interview to the posts of assistant professor at Ancient Indian History department on Saturday alleged bias against Hindi-speaking candidates.

Interviews were held on Friday for one post of assistant professor each in general, SC and OBC categories at the department of Ancient Indian History, Culture & Archaeology.

A group of students, led by research scholar Mrityunjay Tiwari, held a demonstration on Saturday on the campus and submitted a memorandum to the registrar claiming that Hindi-speaking candidates were discouraged to take part in the interview.

Candidates alleged that Hindi-speaking candidates were not properly interviewed by the panel and were asked to leave within 2-3 minutes with the “advice” to learn English too.

According to recommendation sheet of BHU’s recruitment and assessment cell, 27 candidates out of 112 were shortlisted for interview in unreserved category, 14 out of 48 in SC category, and 11 out of 51 were shortlisted in OBC category.

BHU spokesperson Rajesh Singh said the interview was conducted as per prescribed norms. “Since BHU is one of the centres of excellence in the country, it is obvious that candidates are supposed to know English too. Foreign candidates also apply for posts in BHU. The interview was conducted in unbiased manner,” he added.

BHU campus witnessed a month-long protest after a Muslim candidate, Firoz Khan, was appointed assistant professor at Sahitya department in SVDV faculty in November last year. The agitation was called off after Khan joined the department of Sanskrit in the faculty of arts after qualifying another interview.

88,['5/01/2020'],Rekindling the love for comic books,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Trichy: When technological advancement and communication gadgets are alienating children from reading books, a private school in Trichy is trying to rekindle interest among children by exposing them to comic books.

Collection of over a 1,000 Tamil comic books, among which a few are over three decades old, adorn a room dedicated exclusively for comics in Bharathi Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Trichy.

The collections include popular comic books of yesteryears like Lion, Muthu and Indrajal, Mandrake the Magician – in Tamil and many more. Some of them were sold for Rs 1 and Rs 1.25 in those days.

An avid comic collector from Trichy, K Balakrishnan, principal of the school has been preserving these books over these years.

During those days, reading books or playing sports were among the limited leisurely activities for children and comic books helped me visualize. Now that stories are available in visual 3D format, comic books have taken a backseat, says Balakrishnan.

By making these comic books available for students, we have decided to rekindle the reading habit among children which has come down drastically. Balakrishnan has dedicated a room exclusively for comic books in the school. While he had displayed his collections in the school last week for the public, there wasn’t much of a reception.

While there are a few comic collectors across the state, Balakrishnan said that they have decided to meet in Trichy next month to create awareness on comic reading with their collections.

“Reading such stories will help children visualize the stories that they read which will eventually help them become more creative. Our objective is to create awareness among parents on the benefits of comics,” he said.

Terming 80’s and 90’s to be the golden era of comic books, L Venkateswaran, 44 from Chennai says that advent of visual media has taken away the attention of children from comics.

While stories fascinate children, there are numerous storytelling websites these days. Owning over a 500 comic books, Venkateswaran says these comic books are a tool for him to make his children learn Tamil as they are not taught Tamil in school as it is Kendriya Vidyalaya.

Trichy: Members of Tamil Desiya Katchi ‘locked’ up several shops run by north Indians in a few central districts including Pudukottai on Saturday. They were demanding that people from northern states like Rajasthan vacate shops as they were affecting the employment opportunities of locals.

They put locks on five shops in Mela Rajaveethi in Pudukottai town and seven shops in Pattukottai in Thanjavur district.

They also left pamphlets asking the state government to evict north Indians by asking them to vacate.

The pamphlet also added they will not hesitate to resort to violence if they don’t shut shop and return.

Cases have been booked against the party members in Pattukottai, Thanjavur and Pudukottai districts based on the complaints from the shop owners.

“The presence of north Indians is on the rise in commercial areas of every town especially for trading activities. While they are into every other business right from plastics products, jewellery, food and beverages, north Indians hawkers have been slowly occupying road side space as well,” said R Tamil Nesan, president of Tamil Desiya Katchi.

Tamil Nesan also blamed traders from north India for smuggling banned gutka products into the state in connivance with local politicians and officials.

91,['5/01/2020'],CG Road won’t be dug for 20 years: Vijay Nehra,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Vasant Tirodkar

AHMEDABAD: No sooner did the civic body undertake some demolition to prune the newly constructed crossroads on the 2.6km-long CG Road — along Parimal, Girish Cold Drinks, Stadium, and Panchvati — to widen junctions for traffic smooth flow, doubts were raised by CG Road stakeholders as to whether the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) was confident of its design.

On the other hand, the AMC has issued a statement that the pedestrian-centric Rs32 crore refurbishment of CG Road will not be dug up by utility companies or the civic body for the next 20 years! That’s the guarantee the Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra gave to CG Road stakeholders. “The traffic junctions were pruned around the corners for a smooth left-exit. Apart from that we have made it clear that with special underground duct line and a chamber constructed every 30 meters for utility companies — cables, optical fibre — for repair works no digging will be allowed for the next two decades,” says Nehra. A senior AMC West Zone official, however, added that the power line and gas lines have independent passages. But these assurances have yet not allayed doubts of CG Road shopowners on issues like parking.

Vice-president of CG Road Shopowners’ Association, Vasant Tirodkar says, “We have been asked by AMC to wait till January end before the design is explained to us. We have no idea as to how the parking space for visitors and 15,000 temporary and permanent employees on CG Road will be arranged.” He adds, “A bus service for ferrying shoppers was envisaged some time back for Navarangpura multi-level parking, but AMC asked us to pay for these services. None of the members showed willingness to pay.”

92,['5/01/2020'],I don’t like being called an icon: Shanta Gokhale,"This story is from January 5, 2020

When it comes to introducing an author like Shanta Gokhale to friends, there are a few ways to go about doing that. The most basic way would be to tell them that she is the ‘mother’of art critic Girish Shahane and actor and former host of TV show Surabhi, Renuka Shahane. But that’s like saying that Mt Fuji is some mountain in Japan. The ideal way as her fans and readers would like it would be to introduce Gokhale as the author of two Marathi books, Rita Welinkar and Tya Varshi, of which Rita Welinkar is a book so seminal, it is recommended reading in colleges. She is a playwright – the plays she has written include Avinash, Dip and Dop and Rosemary for Remembrance; a noted translator; has penned screenplays for films and documentaries; and has been a columnist as well. Her most recent work is her autobiography, One Foot in the Ground: A Life Told Through the Body. At 80, Gokhale continues to keep doing what she does best: Write. In an interview she recently gave to TOI, Gokhale spoke about her creativity- filled life:

Your novel Rita Welinkar is studied in colleges today. When it first came out, did the book – with its story about a woman choosing to love a married man – shake up society?

At the time I wrote it, the subject of Rita Welinkar was in a way edgy but it wasn’t, in its manner of writing, in your face because I was just writing how I felt; I was never conscious of opposing something. When that happens, people don’t see a book or its subject as a threat. So no, it didn’t shake up society or anything. People who read it thought it was a different angle, differently written, and it was more or less well-received by the public. But the fact is it has remained on the shelf, people continue to read it even today.

You have said earlier that you had an obscenely happy childhood. Did writing come easily to you as that happy child?

Frankly, yes. It always did come easily to me. It always starts in school with essays and you find that you are topping in class, and you always get very good marks for your essays. And then, an interest in writing is building up. And then you try your hand at various forms of writing and hone in on certain forms that you can do well. It’s not difficult, but it is when you seriously decide that you want to write that the trouble begins because then you are not writing for your pleasure, you are practicing an art and that art has certain traditions, certain demands and if you can’t fulfil them, then you can’t call yourself a writer.

You have written in your autobiography about having parents who thought marriage was not necessary...

Absolutely. My father didn’t even say, ‘If you don’t want to (get married)’. He just said, ‘Why do you want to get married and have babies and all that? Come stay with us. Teach, read, write. Why do you have to get married? ’

How liberating was it to lead a life where getting married wasn’t the be-all and end-all?

We were strictly middle-class and yet, my father had this dream of sending us abroad, to England, to study. I was 16-and-a-half when we went. He sat me down at the time and said, ‘I am spending more than I can afford to on your education because I think education is the most important thing, but I am not going to spend a paisa on your wedding and neither I nor your mother will go around looking for a bridegroom for you.’ You want to marry, find your own man. Later, I paid for my own wedding because I agreed with my father.

As a writer with a repertoire as rich as yours, do you ever look back at all that you’ve achieved or do you just move on to the next project?

I think I just move on. Very rarely do I look back as such. There is always something new to do which I haven’t done before. So that’s something to look forward to rather than look back at what I have already done. It is not overwhelming, and constantly, one is aware of writers who have done so much more. For eg, the writer Vijay Tendulkar wrote 28 plays in all apart from columns, short fiction, journalistic articles. I have not been that kind of writer. I think, also as a woman writer, home and children take up a lot of time. Time becomes a concern, space becomes a concern. Had I been a male writer, I’d have written much more. It is only in these last 20 years or so that I have had time for myself, to write what I like as much as much as I like.

How do you like it when society puts you on a pedestal and calls you an icon?

I don’t like it at all. First of all, I kind of heard that this seemed to be the place I was put into. I was embarrassed and I was thinking, ‘Really? Why? What for?’ But then, over the last two or three years, I have begun to think that by the time you come to a certain age, people who are giving awards are thinking, ‘It is time we gave her an award!’ When the award is given and I am introduced, I hear the list of things I have done, and then I feel ‘Okay! ’ I keep thinking of people who have done so much more and so much better. Yeah, I guess there are people who have done so much less and so much worse, so maybe, maybe… but it embarrasses the hell out of me.

Trichy: Laying emphasis on the need to continuously improve one’s skills and keep oneself updated, Joint Secretary of University Grants Commission (UGC), Shakeel Ahmed, said one must strive to acquire knowledge throughout one’s life. Addressing graduates at the graduation day at Jamal Mohamed college (JMC), Trichy, on Saturday, he said education is about opening up the mind to accept new ideas and to evaluate them for achieving progress.

He lauded JMC for imparting quality-oriented and value-based education. Ahmed said children should grow up facing challenges in life. “Today parents are trying to shield their children from problems and harsh realities of life. They think that exposing them to problems will hamper their studies, but education should be attained through life’s experiences,” he said.

Asking students to develop a positive attitude, he advised them to stay away from negativism. Citing the example of Wright brothers who invented aircrafts, he said if they had accepted the theory that any object heavier than air couldn’t be flown in the air, they would never have invented aircrafts.

He asked students to give back to the society to ensure the country was on par with the developed countries in the world. Education is about increasing the confidence of an individual to dream and to translate that dream into reality. Referring to Tamil poet Avvaiyar’s words, he said whatever they had learnt so far may be just handful and what remains to be learnt is as vast as the universe.

Anuradha Paudwal

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Singer Anuradha Paudwal has dismissed the claims made by a 45-year-old Thiruvananthapuram resident that she was the singer’s daughter who was abandoned soon after birth. Responding to the claim made by Karmala Modex , that she has filed a petition before district family court here to establish the ‘truth’ about her parents, Paudwal said that she was yet to receive court notice. If I did receive court notice, then I would face it legally, she said.

She also said that Karmala may be under some delusion. Paudwal was responding to TOI’s queries on the claims by Karmala.

On Wednesday, Karmala, a resident of Varkala, made shocking claims while addressing a news conference here. She said that she was the daughter of Anuradha and husband Arun Paudwal, but raised by her foster parents Ponnachan and Agnes. According to her, Anuradha and Arun handed her over to Ponnachan and Agnes soon after her birth in 1974 in Karnataka . Ponnachan revealed the truth about her birth a few years ago on his deathbed. He told her that both families were known to each other and Anuradha and husband decided to give up the baby as it was not possible for them to raise the baby owing to her busy schedule. Ever since, she had been trying to contact the singer, but in vain.

As a final resort, she filed a petition before the district family court here to legally make the singer admit their relationship. She also said in the news conference that she was ready to undergo even a DNA test to prove her claims.

In her petition filed before the court, Karmala has also sought appropriate compensation for the childhood she lost under her foster parents, who could not support her studies beyond Class X owing to financial crisis.

The court has scheduled her case for hearing on January 27.

97,['5/01/2020'],Attipetty to be made Servant of God,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Kochi: Yet another Keralite is on the path to sainthood as the Catholic Church has decided to declare Archbishop Joseph Attipetty as Servant of God, marking the commencement of the cause for his canonization, on January 21.

Mar Attipetty was the first person from the local community to be made Archbishop of Verapoly. Marking the commencement of the Universal Catholic Church’s canonical process for sainthood, the official declaration would be made at St Francis Assisi Cathedral, Broadway, Ernakulam. This coincides with the 50th year commemoration of the prelate’s death.

Archbishop Attipetty was born on June 25, 1894 in the Cruz Milagris parish of Kurisinkal, Ochanthuruth on the island of Vypeen across Cochin Harbour. He was consecrated Archbishop at the age of 39, taking over the reins from Archbishop Angel Mary Perez-Cecilia, a Spaniard who was the last in the long line of Carmelite prelates of Kerala, starting in 1659 with Joseph Sebastiani, the first Vicar Apostolic of Malabar.

“During the 36 years of his regime, the archdiocese made magnificent progress in the field of higher education, health care, growth of religious congregations, social welfare measures and overall development. He died on January 21, 1970. His mortal remains were interred at St Francis Assisi Cathedral,” an official communique from the Church stated.

Archbishop Joseph Kalathiparambil, Metropolitan of Verapoly Province, would officiate at the thanksgiving mass in which he will make the official declaration. A decree from the Vatican Congregation for the Causes of Saints will be read during the holy mass, in which various bishops, laity and the religious would attend.

A tribunal for the cause of sainthood will be constituted by Archbishop Kalathiparambil soon for taking the process forward. Fr Andrews Alexander, a Capuchin friar and an expert on canonisation, is the postulator for the cause of Attipetty.

An organising committee for the starting event of the canonization process was constituted in a meeting held at the Verapoly Archbishop’s house on Thursday. Archbishop Kalathiparambil is the patron of the committee, Monsignor Mathew Kallingal and Monsignor Matthew Elanjimittam, vicar generals of the archdiocese, are the chairpersons, Monsignor Joseph Padiyaramparambil, rector St Francis Assisi Cathedral, is the general convenor, and Sherry J Thomas, general secretary of the Kerala Latin Catholic Association, is the joint convenor of the committee.

101,['5/01/2020'],Man fined for ‘mice-ate-my-passport’ story,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Bhopal: Here’s a reminder — your passport is government property and it’s probably a good idea to keep it with the family jewels. An applicant for a duplicate passport learnt this the hard way when he was fined Rs 5,000 for claiming that rats gnawed up his passport.

Officials explained that he was fined for carelessness in handling the passport. Regional passport officer Rashmi Baghel told TOI that when a passport is issued, it is expected that the holder takes care of it. “It is, after all, government property. If someone applies for a fresh passport in the ‘damaged category’, he has to pay a fine, along with the usual fee. In this case, a few pages of the passport had been completely gnawed away. He confessed that the passport was lying among his books and that his house was mice-infested. So, he had to pay a fine of Rs 5,000 for damage to government property as he failed to keep the document in a safe place where it won’t come to any harm,” said Baghel.

Such extreme cases, where entire pages of the passport are missing, don’t come very often, said Baghel. “A few months ago, another man came to us with his passport in tatters. He said he forgot to take it out of his pocket after travel when he dumped all his clothes in the washing machine,” she said. Jet-blasted and spun dry, most of the passport came apart in little bits.

“Passport is a serious document and should not be taken casually. The man whose passport got washed also had to pay a heavy fine as most of the pages went missing and there was severe damage to the front and back pages,” the RPO added. It’s so serious, in fact, that if someone applies twice under the ‘damaged’ category, they may be treated as a habitual offender and denied a fresh passport.

“Damage from water spill and ink stains are common. We get a lot of these cases, and we understand that mishaps happen. But cases where pages go missing are very serious as the applicant may be involved in some illegal activity. So, if the RPO finds that a person has applied for fresh passport under ‘damage’ category more than once, it can turn down the request because that person is not capable of taking care of a government document,” explained Baghel.

BENGALURU: A city-based software professional, Sushant Sunil Thombre, has scored 99.99 percentile in the Common Admission Test ( CAT ) 2019, that holds key to the top management institutes of the country.

Ten candidates scored 100 percentile from across the country and one of them, whose details are yet to be known, is from Karnataka. Twenty one candidates have scored 99.99 percentile in the examination.

A native of Nashik, Thombre completed his engineering in electronics and communications from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT Nagpur) in 2018 and moved to the city to join a software firm.

“I put in at least two hours for studies on weekdays after work and more than four hours on weekends,” he said.

In the four months before exam, Thombre dedicated his entire weekends for preparations. “I opted for test series from TIME and spent three hours for the tests and remaining four to five hours in analysing it,” he explained. He hopes to get into either IIM-Ahmedabad or IIM- Bangalore.

Like Thombre, 18 other candidates who scored 99.99 percentile are from the engineering/technology background.

103,['5/01/2020'],Protesters seek relief for nun who left convent,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Kochi: A group of protesters associated with the Kerala Christian Reformation Movement held a protest here demanding compensation for a nun who had left the convent a few months ago. The protesters held a symbolic collection drive for the rehabilitation of the nun in front of the St Joseph Provincialate convent of the Assisi Sisters of Mary Immaculate (ASMI) Congregation here on Saturday.

The protest was attended by the family of the ex-nun, Sr Delsy, as well.

Sr Delsy had left the convent as she felt uncomfortable with the lifestyle at the convent. She had joined the congregation at the age of 17 and was made a nun about four years ago.

Sr Delsy said that she took the decision to leave the congregation as she strongly sensed that she would become a victim of physical abuse.

“I took the decision to join the congregation out of a firm desire to serve God. However, my experience was horrible. I had to face mental torture. I wanted to do social work but they never let me do what I wanted, but made me do menial tasks. I thought that if I stayed there any longer, I would become like them, so I decided to quit,” said Sr Delsy.

Her father Thomaskutty P K said that the congregation offered them charity, but not compensation. “We were told by those in the Church that there are provisions to provide compensation or financial aids to those who decide to end their monastic life. However, when we talked with the Church authorities, they told us that they could give the money only as charity, if we wished to marry off our daughter. We are not wealthy, but we would find some way to help our daughter. We don’t want their charity,” said Thomaskutty.

Thomaskutty, a daily wager, added that he gave the share of money for his daughter to the congregation when she joined the convent. “She is nearing 30 and we do not have enough money for her marriage,” he said, adding that he has decided to continue fighting for his daughter.

TOI tried to contact the congregation, but the calls went unanswered.

Thiruvananthapuram: The jugs that cool water without electricity, ‘meen chatties’ making curries that can leave lasting effect on taste buds and pots that make soft and tasty palappams are reminiscences of a humble past. If you want to have a look and grab a few of them, then head to a pottery expo at Kerala Gandhi Smarak Nidhi of Gandhi Bhavan, Thycaud.

The terracotta products on display and sale at the expo are the handiwork of artisans belonging to Kumbara community at Nilambur.

“We don’t know how long we will be able to keep up with this trade. In another 10 to 20 years, this trade will be vanished,” said Vijayakumari M of Anaswaram Kitchen Product and Murals, a self-help group of Kumbaras from Nilambur.

Around 500 families from Kumbara community at Nilambur still work as potters. The business has gone dull with the arrival of aluminium, steel and plastic in the kitchens. The organizers are expecting help and support from the government to preserve their craft.

The pottery exhibition is also the story of survival of 50 families who are still depending on their traditional livelihood to overcome the loss they suffered in 2019 floods.

“We organized this exhibition to popularise pottery. We are surviving with the craft we know,” Vijayakumari said.

“The products are so affordable. This is a great initiative and we need to support them”, said Satheeshan Nair, a customer.

More than 150 articles made of clay, starting from Rs 100 to Rs 17,000, are sold at the Gandhi Bhavan.

Curry pots, which are microwavable, phulkha chappathi pots, bowls, jugs, jars, candle stands, pen holders and murals made of terracotta are the main attraction of the exhibition.

The exhibition, which began on Thursday, is open to the public from 10am to 8pm till Wednesday.

Vijay Rupani

GANDHINAGAR: Chief minister Vijay Rupani on Saturday said his government was thinking of bringing a legislation to prevent “unauthorized, unregistered” boats of other states from fishing in the Arabian Sea along the coast here.

Rupani was talking to reporters after interacting with a group of fishermen in Gandhinagar under his Mann ni Moklaash (speaking from your heart) programme.

He said he had received representation from the state's fishermen on this and he had assured them of safeguarding their interests.

“One of the concerns of the fishermen is that unauthorized, unregistered boats from other states should be stopped (from fishing in the sea along Gujarat coast). Gujarat government has made a decision regarding this. If required, we will go ahead to make an Act on this,"" he said.

“We will prevent unauthorized fishermen (from other states) coming here for fishing activities and will take legal action against them,"" he said.

Rupani further said, “During the interaction with the fishermen, they said that they be considered at par with farmers as their activities are like farming. The farmers grow food grains in farms while fishermen take it from sea. So they also wanted credit card benefits like the farmers, under the state's Sagar Khedu scheme.”

“We are positive over their demand. We have assured them that we will talk to the central government on this,"" Rupani said.

Rupani said his government pays Rs 300 per day as compensation to fishermen from Gujarat who end up in Pakistan jails in case they inadvertently cross the international maritime border and are nabbed by agencies of the neighbouring country.

He said the government had also decided to pay Rs 2 lakh to the kin of fisherman missing in the Arabian sea, after lapse of a year.

PANAJI: Irate depositors with accounts in Mapusa Urban Co-operative Bank (MUCB) on Saturday demanded that the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) investigate the bank’s functioning.

MUCB’s customers, nearly 3.5 lakh in number, also said they plan to file an FIR against the management for financial irregularities.

At a meeting held in Panaji, depositors voiced concerns regarding their savings, which remain locked due to directives by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ). “Depositors demanded that the matter of mismanagement of public funds should be forwarded to the EOW to conduct a thorough investigation as is the case with the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-Operative Bank, where several members of the board of directors have been taken into custody,” they said in a statement.

The beleaguered bank fell into financial trouble after the management allegedly gave loans to persons of their choice without following due diligence and norms. The mining ban pushed the bank over the brink putting its financial assets in the red at the cost of funds of depositors, said customers.

The RBI has now set MUCB a February 2 deadline to find a solution to its financial woes. Depositors meanwhile are deciding their next move to initiate action against the management to recover deposits

Irate depositors and stakeholders also accused the bank’s chairman, board of directors and general manager of not taking customers into confidence. “Customers are entitled to know what’s happening, but instead, they are being kept in the dark,” a depositor said.

Panaji: Panchayats minister Mauvin Godinho on Saturday said that the zilla panchayat (ZP) elections, which are likely to be conducted in mid-March 2020, will be held on party lines.

“There is no change in the manner of conducting ZP elections. It will be conducted along party lines,” Godinho told TOI.

The upcoming ZP elections were discussed at the recent cabinet meeting. Sources said that if the government doesn’t want to conduct ZP elections along party lines, they will have to make a legislative change.

“How can we change the decision (to conduct ZP elections on party lines) when we (BJP) are the ones who started it (holding it on party lines),” BJP general secretary Sadanand Tanawade said.

In 2015, then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar had decided to conduct ZP elections along party lines and accordingly, the Goa Panchayati Raj Act was amended in March 2015. The provision was, however, not extended to panchayat elections. At the time, Congress and NCP had decided not to field candidates on their party ticket in places where they had support of independent candidates. This time, Congress has already announced its intent to fight polls on party lines with the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) executive committee passing a resolution in favour. MGP too is in favour of going to the elections on party lines. One reason is that MGP wants to assess the political strength of various parties.

Prior to 2015, parties would back candidates or panels of their choice in civic polls in the absence of provisions in the act.

Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra hold ZP elections along party lines.

There are 25 ZP members each in North and South Goa.

The mineral-rich beach sand is invaluable and can in a big way support the state’s economy.

Sources said that the local administration had asked police to provide details of the alleged offenders who took part in damaging properties and vehicles after Friday prayers on December 20. Now, police have provided names and addresses of 46 individuals. Notably, all of them were already booked at Nagar-Kotawali police station and Civil Lines police station for vandalising public property.

ADM Amit Singh said on Saturday, “We have received 48 claims for damages to vehicles and property in which 46 notices have been sent after examining police reports. We have not disclosed the amount yet. It would be revealed after examination and assessment. For now, we have only sent notices to them for court appearance.”

The process is still on and final notices to recover the cost of damages will be slapped in the coming days, sources added.

112,['5/01/2020'],"‘Gujaratis reached US, but not IAS/IPS’","This story is from January 5, 2020

Gandhinagar: Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, who is also the spokesperson for the state government, spoke about a need for Gujaratis to aspire to cracking the civil services and working in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Indian Police Service (IPS).

Speaking at an Anjana Patel community event in Gandhinagar, Patel said: “Gujaratis have reached the USA but, unfortunately, are not seen as IAS, IPS or IFS officers in the Gujarat secretariat. In many states, local officers get prominence in their bureaucracy while we have very few Gujarati IAS/IPS officers.”

Patel said that Gujaratis have traditionally remained more focused on establishing a business or migrating to foreign countries for better prospects. “Seldom have Gujaratis focused on pursuing government jobs like youth in other states do. We don’t see much representation from Gujarat in the IAS/IPS, railway, banking or central PSUs such as ONGC. To ensure the state’s best interests, it is necessary that Gujaratis take up to government jobs by qualifying in competitive exams. I want to see the majority name plates at the secretariat of Gujarati officers,” he added.

Gujarat has only recently started warming up to UPSC exams. In the 2018 UPSC examination, 18 from the state had secured top positions, including one in the top 100.

Gujarat had a great run in the UPSC in 2017, when a record 43 candidates cracked the examination.

Not a cricketer to play 20-20, I’m a politician: Nitin Patel

Ahmedabad: The T20 World Cup may be scheduled for later this year but the format is ruling the narrative of Gujarat politics these days. Since the arrival of the year 2020, CM Vijay Rupani has at least twice invoked the rapid cricket format, saying that he is here to play the ‘whole series of 20-20 matches’ and he ‘is not afraid to play half way down to pitch to ensure the people’s work is done’.

This was read as the CM scotching rumours of him being replaced as CM, and underscoring for his detractors within the party that he is a decisive leader who is not scared of taking tough decisions.

This idiom was taken forward on Saturday, when deputy CM Nitin Patel was asked what he made of these remarks.

Patel dodged said that he did not want to react on such things. “In politics, opponents have tried to defeat me too, but they all failed. I am not a cricketer so I can’t talk of 20-20. I am a politician and am in public service since 1972-73.”

Patel tried to distance himself from the rumours of Rupani’s removal and him being considered for the CM’s post again. Some have taken his statement to mean that ‘Patel is trying to potray himself as different from Rupani’.

Panaji: The season’s first Olive Ridley turtle nest on Morjim beach was laid on Saturday. The arrival of a flippered visitor marked a delayed start to the nesting season that has already recorded two more arrivals in South Goa in the new year. “The turtle arrived at Morjim beach at around 3.30am on Saturday and laid 118 eggs,” a source said.

The first nesting was reported at Galgibaga beach on January 1. Another nesting was reported at Agonda beach the next day.

Morjim beach, which lies on the bank of the Chapora river, is where Goa’s modest turtle conservation effort begun in the late 1990s. During the 2018-19 season, 22 nests had been laid at Morjim and Mandrem and 1,500-odd hatchlings had been released from about 2,500 eggs.

While Morjim and Mandrem in North Goa have been designated turtle nesting sites, Agonda and Galgibaga in South Goa have also been granted similar status under the Coastal Regulation Zone notification, 2011.

A small strip of the southern part of Morjim beach has been earmarked as a turtle nesting site. Tourism activities, especially night illumination and noise, however, often disturb the reptiles.

GFP president Vijai Sardesai

PANAJI: GFP on Saturday said that it would move an adjournment motion before the assembly to draw attention to the Mhadei water diversion issue. GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that the party would seek Congress and MGP’s support to see the motion is passed in the House.

Opposition leader and Congress MLA Digambar Kamat said that Congress Legislature Party (CLP) would deliberate on the issue on Monday.

“GFP will move an adjournment motion in this session. We know that under Rule 68 we need 1/6 of the strength of the House which we do not have. We will appeal to Congress and MGP and we will approach the independents to support us in the adjournment motion,” Sardesai said.

The primary objective of an adjournment motion is to draw the attention of the House to a recent matter of urgent public importance having serious implications for the state.

When contacted whether Congress would support the motion, Kamat told TOI, that he would have to put it up for discussion at the CLP. “We will discuss this issue. We will see what stand the party should take,” he said.

Interestingly, the GFP chief had rued the lack of consensus among the opposition. “The way the Mhadei should have got attention, it has not happened, and this is the collective failure of the opposition. We expect the opposition to be proactive. The opposition is going through a crisis,” Sardesai said.

116,['5/01/2020'],Pics of illegal guns on social media landed 21 in jail in ’19,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Allahabad: Pratapgarh police arrested at least 21 youths in 2019 for posting pictures and videos on social media brandishing illegal firearms.

While the first such case surfaced in April in Lalganj, highest number of cases were reported in Maheshganj and Lalganj police station areas.

Superintendent of police (Pratapgarh) Abhishek Singh said such cases started declining after cops acted strictly against miscreants. “Police are spreading the message among youngsters that posing with guns on social media can land them in jail. Majority of youths who possessed illegal weapons and uploaded photographs or videos were from rural background. Cases were lodged against them under the Arms Act and they were sent to jail,” he said.

The SP said investigations revealed that over 80% youngsters who uploaded their videos or photographs with illegal weapons wanted to impress their friends and had no ill intention. “Highest number of cases were reported from Lalganj and Maheshganj police stations,” he added.

Cops are taking strict action against law-breakers to curb the practice as such people want to catch the imagination of lakhs of social media users. Crime branch and intelligence wing keep track of social media sites throughout the year to look for people posing with guns.

In last fortnight, police have traced at least three cases where old photographs or videos, dating back to 2015 or 2016, were uploaded on social media. Investigations found that some people uploaded old photographs of their rivals to settle scores with them.

“We are examining posts on social networking sites. While people posting pictures with illegal weapons are being arrested, we will act against those people too who are trying to settle scores with someone,” the SP said.

Cops are also trying to find out people supplying illegal weapons to them.

Thiruvananthapuram: Doctors, staff members and students of Trivandrum Medical College Hospital on Saturday bid farewell to general surgery associate professor Dr Minimol K L , who was found dead inside her car near pathological lab of the Medical College campus on Friday evening under mysterious circumstances.

Colleagues, who had arrived at the morgue even before postmortem began on Saturday, said 45-year-old Minimol was a cheerful doctor who was equally efficient in her work. General surgery department head Dr Abdul Latheef said it took little time for Dr Minimol to get herself established as a prominent general surgeon. “She was known for her soft approach with the patients and for the precision of surgeries she conducted. Minimol’s expertise with paintings and art works was however less known. She enjoyed painting in her free time away from the hospital,” he said.

Minimol’s husband Dr Vinu C V, who is an associate professor of cardiothoracic department at Medical College Hospital, had approached Sreekaryam police station on Friday noon with a complaint that his wife was missing which led Sreekaryam police to launch a probe to track down the doctor. Police with the help of mobile tower location tracked down the doctor who was found sitting unconscious in the driving seat with a syringe injected in her hand around 6.30pm. While Minimol was rushed for treatment, her life could not be saved. The body was initially kept for public observance at the multi-speciality block and old auditorium for 15 minutes each before being transported to her residence at Alathara near Sreekaryam for cremation.

Sreekaryam sub-inspector K G Prathap Chandran, who is probing the case of unnatural death, said it is still too early to determine the exact cause of death. “The samples collected from the deceased have been sent for forensic examination. It will take at least a week to get the reports of postmortem and forensic examination. We found her with the syringe attached to her hand but details regarding the type of medicine used in the injection are still not clear,” the SI said.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police has registered 13 FIRs against a group of builders suspected to be involved in an alleged housing scam . Scores of buyers were allegedly offered “DDA flats under a central government scheme” in Dwarka .

TOI had first reported about the scam after which a Special Investigation Team was formed to look into the cases. Police suspect the role of Nigerian gangs operating from south and west Delhi to be involved in it.

The probe revealed that the builders attracted home buyers in various categories for investments in lucrative housing schemes through SMSes and online advertisements. The potential buyers were lured to pay a “development charge” to apply for the “DDA flats” after which the builders disappeared with the money.

“We are probing the role of some Nigerian gangs since the modus operandi is similar to some previous cases in which they were involved. We are taking the help of cyber experts to track down the source from which the messages were generated,” said OP Mishra, additional CP, EOW.

The builders had hired agencies to send bulk messages to the people in which they even provided a link to a website through which the application could be made and the money could be transferred. The fraudsters had created several web portals and social media groups. Nearly one lakh people have enrolled themselves through the website, the cops suspect. Rewant Kumar Mishra, a resident of Sangam Vihar, had earlier registered an FIR against Revanta Multi State CGHS LTD. Mishra said that in 2015, he had come across an advertisement that the company, located at Sector- 23, Dwarka, was going to build residential flats through landpooling in Dwarka’s L Zone.

After forming a society, the company had started urging people to invest in “Smart Residency”. The accused issued brochures and made various presentations citing the DDA-approved landpooling policy to lure investors. Mishra said he was allotted the membership of the society after investing Rs 20.2 lakh for a 1,760-sqft flat. The total cost was pegged at Rs 51.2 lakh. In March 2019, he was asked to pay another Rs 5.9 lakh.

The company said “the Development Ministry, Govt of India” had reduced the floor-area ratio from 400 to 200 due to scarcity of water and other resources. The complainant later came to know through media reports that DDA hadn’t announced any such scheme.

Police sources say that the matter had first come to fore before the DDA which had started its own enquiry. However, when the Authority came across a number of complaints, the matter was informed to Delhi Police. The EOW was subsequently asked to probe it.

Cases under sections of cheating, impersonation and forgery have been registered against the builders.

Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya talks to protesting seers during a visit to the Magh Mela ground in Allahabad o... Read More

Allahabad: Irked over not being allotted land on the 2000-bigha venue, scores of seers blocked the way and refused to budge when deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and his cavalcade tried to enter the Magh Mela premises on Saturday afternoon.

Most of the seers were associated with Sant Hitkarni Hriday Narayan Sewa Sansthan and other religious organisations. The deputy CM was in Allahabad to review preparations for Magh Mela.

Shouting slogans in front of the Mela Adhikari’s office, the seers alleged that they had not been allocated land on the Mela premises and that they had been staging a hunger strike near the Mela Adhikari’s office since the past three days.

The route was blocked for over 15 minutes. The protesters also claimed that Mela officials were least bothered to hear them out and address their grievances. They also said that if they weren’t allocated land soon enough, they would protest in front of chief minister’s official residence in Lucknow.

Saint Doodh Nath Shastri, who was among the protesting seers, alleged, “There are several irregularities in land allocation. Seers of many organisations like Shri Ram Chandra Sewa sansthan, Maa Sharda Shakti Peeth, Paramhans Shaikshanik Sewa Nyas had been staging a hunger strike since January 2. However, Mela officials didn’t approach them even once to get the issue sorted out.”

Another seer Amrit Lal from Hari Om Sewa Shivir said, “Here saints are being treated inhumanly, which would not be tolerated.” Before Mela police and district officials could do anything, Maurya himself stepped out of his car and assured the agitating saints that their grievances would be addressed. The agitating seers called off the protest after being assured by the deputy CM of quick action. The Magh Mela will start from January 10.

120,['5/01/2020'],Uzbek boy gets his voice back in Delhi,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Ozotilla

NEW DELHI: An Uzbek national who had lost the ability to speak following a major accident regained his voice recently following reconstructive surgery conducted at a Delhi hospital .

Khusanbek Ozotilla fell from the terrace of his house, suffering critical head injuries, for which he underwent tracheostomy — a surgical procedure that involves creating an opening in the neck in order to place a tube into the windpipe — 10 years ago.

Since then, he has had to live with a hole in his neck due to which he lost his ability to speak, said Dr Suresh Singh Naruka, a consultant in the ENT department at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals.

He added that Ozotilla couldn’t speak at all when he was brought to the hospital by his mother. “Childhood is all about talking, learning and exploring. However, Ozotilla was deprived of all these pleasures as he was unable to speak. After 10 years of not being able to communicate, his mother approached us,” the doctor said.

The child was admitted to the hospital on December 16. The surgery was planned to be executed in two stages.

In the first stage, Ozotilla underwent an endoscopic examination where his airway was found to be narrowed, a condition called subglottic stenosis.

After assessment, a T-tube was placed in his trachea, said Dr Ameet Kishore, senior consultant surgeon, ENT, at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals.

After examination, it was decided that a reconstructive surgery would be carried out to correct the narrowed airway. This was technically challenging, Dr Kishore said.

“After seven days, the second-stage surgery was conducted. A proper reconstruction of his windpipe was conducted successfully using a part of his rib as a graft, thus making the windpipe wider. The operation enabled closing of the opening in the neck,” the doctor added.

“Finally, after 10 years of misery and suffering, the child can speak again. He has now returned home and is leading a normal life,” Dr Naruka said. “We are happy that he is able to speak now with clarity,” Dr Kishore said, adding that tracheostomy is more hazardous in children than in adults, and carries special risks in the young.

Meerut/Muzaffarnagar: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met families of victims of alleged “police excesses” and violence during protests against the amended Citizenship Act in Meerut and Muzaffarnagar districts of western Uttar Pradesh.

“Police have to protect the people, give them justice, but what has happened here is entirely opposite,” Priyanka Gandhi, who had earlier visited affected families in Lucknow and Bijnor, told reporters.

“I have written a letter to governor detailing on police brutalities. Innocent people were targeted without any reason. Police ransacked homes and assaulted people,” Gandhi said in Muzaffarnagar.

During her unscheduled visit to Muzaffarnagar, the Congress leader went to the residence of Maulana Asad Raza Hussaini in Kidwai Nagar and met the family. Hussaini, a renowned cleric who runs a madrassa-cum-orphanage, was picked up along with 39 other inmates of the orphanage and was brutally assaulted allegedly by the local police.

Speaking with TOI, cleric Hussaini’s son Mohammad Hussaini said, “She visited our house on Saturday morning and assured us that she is with us. We told her that the police had arrested 17 students of our madrassa. They have released only four students. We also told her how police had assaulted our students.”

Gandhi was accompanied by several local Congress leaders, including former Saharanpur MLA Imran Masood.

The Congress delegation later met the family of Noor Mohammed who was killed during the protests.

“It’s heart-wrenching. His wife who is seven months pregnant and has one-and-a-half-year-old daughter is left all alone,” she said.

“Wherever injustice has happened, we will stand by the people and help them in whatever way possible,” the Congress leader said.

Noor Mohammad,24, was killed during violence when he was returning home after purchasing medicine from Arya Samaj road in Muzaffarnagar for his daughter who was not keeping well.

She also met Ruqaiya Parveen, whose house was allegedly ransacked by the police.

The Congress leader said she has highlighted each and every “police excesses” in a lengthy memorandum to UP governor Anandiben Patel during her visit to the state last week.

“It has all the details of how police have assaulted people without any reason. If there is any wrongdoing, then police should take action. No one can object to it.

“But here the police are indulging in vandalism... the girl was about to get married in two days, she has 16 stitches (on her forehead),” she said.

Towards the afternoon, the delegation left for Meerut where police served the Congress leader a notice under section 144 of CrPC at Dadri police check post.

Earlier on December 24, UP Police had stopped Priyanka Gandhi and her brother and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi from entering Meerut town, citing prohibitory orders under section 144 of CrPC, as a result of which they had to return to Delhi without meeting the affected families.

However, this time, a meeting of Priyanka Gandhi with the families of the six victims who were killed in Meerut was arranged at the residence of a local NSUI leader.

Later, Meerut additional director general Prashant Kumar said, “She was not stopped in Meerut. Section 144 has already been promulgated and is still in force. The delegation was served a notice regarding this.”

Earlier, Priyanka had met the families of those killed in clashes in Bijnor.

On December 28, Priyanka Gandhi alleged that she was manhandled by police personnel when she tried to resist their attempts to stop her from visiting the Lucknow residence of retired IPS officer SR Darapuri, who was arrested in connection with the anti-CAA protests.

Later, the Congress leader met the family of party worker Sadaf Zafar and alleged that she was arrested on ""baseless"" charges by the police.

A Lucknow court on Saturday granted bail to Sadaf Jafar, Darapuri and 13 others arrested in connection with anti-CAA protests in Lucknow.

Kochi: Additional special sessions court on Saturday dismissed the discharge petition filed by actor Dileep seeking to get his name removed from the accused list in the actress rape case.

The court also denied the request by his counsel seeking 10 days to file an appeal at higher courts before framing charges, citing the Supreme Court order to complete the trial in six months. The court has ordered that the framing of charges would be done on Monday.

The court found merit in the claims of the prosecution that there was prima facie evidence in the case and refused to allow the discharge petition at such an early stage.

“The court heard the arguments in the discharge petitions filed by eighth accused (Dileep) and tenth accused (Vishnu). The court found merit in the prosecution arguments and found that prima facie the charges against the accused stands. Hence,the discharge petition was dismissed. At this point anyway, it was not possible to go deep into the evidence but prima facie the court accepted the prosecution’s arguments,” said advocate A Sureshan, the special prosecutor.

Dileep was not present in court and applied permission for absence, which was granted. However, the court stated it as a last chance as Dileep kept away from court on most of the occasions. Prime accused Pulsar Suni was not produced in court as there was no escort available.

“The court has ordered that the charges against the accused would be framed on January 6 and directed that all accused should be present in court on the day without failure,” Sureshan said.

The counsel for Dileep requested 10 days’ time to approach higher court against the order, which was also denied. The court pointed out the Supreme Court direction to expedite the trial and complete it in six months and denied the requested time, in light of the SC order.

The court had on Wednesday heard Dileep’s counsel for over one hour behind closed doors on the petition as it contained sensitive details. After hearing Dileep’s counsel, the prosecution had objected over-discharging him from the case.

Meanwhile, the discharge petition filed by tenth accused Vishnu was also dismissed by the court. Both accused can challenge the court’s order at higher courts. However, the appeal for discharging them from the case has to be filed before the framing of charges in the case, sources said.

The case refers to the incident on February 17, 2017 in which a female actor was sexually assaulted in a moving car, and the visuals of the crime recorded.

Actor Dileep, was arrested in connection with the case on July 10, 2017 after the preliminary chargesheet was filed. After his arrest, he was charged with rape for conspiring with the prime accused Pulsar Suni for committing the crime.

As the investigating officer of the case, Mir did not take into consideration the role of the man who had hired the two convicts to demolish the hutments nor did she seize the vehicle which was used for the purpose. As per the case details, the two convicts Rakesh alias Lallu Kahar and Rahul Kahar had demolished some huts including their own as they were hired allegedly by former heavyweight councillor from Waghodiya Road Harshit alias Gopi Talati.

In her complaint to Panigate police, one of hut owners, Geeta Jadav, stated that the duo had demolished the huts on Talati’s directions as the slum land was owned by him.

Mir took statements of eye-witnesses and other witnesses, but did not get into the depth of the case where Talati’s role could come to the fore. During the hearing of the case, Mir was also summoned where she admitted that she did not try to find out who had hired the two convicts and did not even try to find out the owner of the land where the demolition took place.

On Friday, the court sentenced the duo to one year of imprisonment and fined them of Rs 10,000 each.

Panaji: GFP has yet to decide whether the party will contest the coming Zilla Panchayat (ZP) elections along party lines or offer support to candidates close to the party’s MLAs. GFP president Vijai Sardesai said the party was in favour of encouraging younger faces in politics, but would take the final decision after the government officially notifies the ZP elections.

ZP elections are slated to be held in March.

“Our MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar says there is a consensus view that the lower tier of democracy should not be politicised. This is a view that is predominant in Goa and that is why even the last time, the Congress did not contest on party lines,” Sardesai said, while speaking to the press at the party office after a meeting of all the office bearers.

Sources say the party is a bit wary about contesting ZP elections on party lines given that GFP was once a party of the ruling dispensation in the state and remains an ally of the NDA.

Meanwhile, Congress has clearly stated that this time they are ready to contest the elections on the party symbol, a break from its earlier stand that grassroots politics should be isolated from party affiliations.

According to Sardesai, a significant section of the BJP legislative wing does not want to contest on party lines. “Some of them feel they cannot afford to take the symbol in their constituency,” Sardesai said, hinting at MLAs who recently broke away from Congress to join BJP.

Indore: A surge in vegetable supply has calmed down prices of greens ruling high for over a month giving some respite to common man.

Vegetable supplies have almost doubled from nearby villages of Indore in past week dampening prices for most green vegetables.

Farooque Raeen, a wholesale vegetable supplier from Indore said, “Supplies of vegetables from local villages have risen sharply in past over a week and this has dampened prices. Vegetable prices are expected to remain down to steady for in near term as supplies look smooth.”

Indore is getting fresh vegetable supplies from villages of Nimar, Barwani, Sanwer and Mhow among other areas.

Prices of most vegetables have fallen over 50 per cent in the wholesale market, said traders.

Prolonged and heavy rain this season had led vegetable prices soaring disturbing household budget of common man after rains damaged a large chuck of vegetables in the region and blocked transportation of greens to local mandis.

In past months, vegetables from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh were sold in the local market to meet demand.

Abdul Rais, a green vegetable dealer at Choithram market said, “Earlier dependency was on outstation and cold storage supply to meet the demand but with fresh arrivals from nearby villages market is back to normal.”

Prices of onions have also dropped significantly in the wholesale market to Rs 40 per kg to Rs 45 per kg after making a record high of Rs 105 per kg, traders said.

In greens, most vegetables bottle gourd, sponge gourd and capsicum have fallen excluding tomato amid a major loss to the crop.

In the wholesale market, tomato is trading at Rs 15 per kg to Rs 18 per kg, traders said.

Agra: Even after two months of its convocation ceremony, Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University administration has not been able to upload answer sheets of meritorious students on the official website. University administration had claimed that answer sheets of students awarded medals for academic performances will be uploaded on the website after the convocation ceremony which took place on October 11.

University administration had adopted the ‘best practice’ of uploading answer sheets of toppers on its website in 2017. The answer sheets of meritorious students were uploaded on the website in 2018. The move was aimed to bring in transparency. Besides, it also gave a chance to common students to see how toppers answer the questions and learn how to achieve high scores.

A BA final year student said, “The evaluation of answer sheets was completed in June. In more than six months, the university administration has not been able to upload copies of meritorious students on the website. We asked our teachers about this but they were not able to offer any valid answer. We are curious to know what the toppers did differently.”

University public relation officer GS Sharma said, “We are in the process of uploading the answer sheets of meritorious students on varsity website. The work will be completed by January end. We are also trying to put video clips of meritorious students providing useful tips to their juniors.”

KA Devassy

KOCHI: Crime Branch (CB) has sought permission from local self-government department (LSGD) to prosecute former president of Maradu panchayat KA Devassy , who is the present opposition leader of Maradu municipality in cases registered against the illegal apartment complexes at Maradu.

After the controversy arose, Devassy said that he had no role in the issue and those who approved the plan are responsible for the present problem. “I have received no information about anyone taking action (against me). I don’t know anything about this case,” he said, responding to CB’s move.

However, a CB officer said that they approached LSG department three weeks ago seeking permission to arraign him in the case and initiate prosecution measures. “We are awaiting a response from LSGD. We will summon him for interrogation and initiate prosecution measures once we receive the permission,” said a source with the investigation team.

Sources said that CB has already collected evidence against the former president and plans to complete its investigation in coming months. CB has questioned over 100 persons as part of the probe, including 22 former panchayat members. However, sleuths were able to collect statements of only 250 apartment owners as the rest were unavailable.

CB is investigating three cases in connection with the construction of H2O Holy Faith, Alpha Serene and Jain Coral Cove based on the petition by apartment owners. The cases were transferred from to CB from local police stations.

As many as four accused, including builder Sandeep Mehta, were arraigned in the case of Jain Coral Cove. Five, including builder Paul Raj and the architect who drew the plan, were named accused in the case of Alpha Serene. Four, including builder Sani Francis, were named accused in the case of H20 Holy Faith.

Former panchayat secretary Mohammed Ashraf, former Maradu panchayat junior superintendent PE Joseph and former UD clerk in Maradu panchayat Jayaram Naik were accused in the three cases.

Sani Francis, Paul Raj, Mohammed Ashraf, PE Joseph and Jayram Naik were arrested and later released on bail. Sandeep Mehta is yet to be traced.

A protest rally against CAA-NRC in Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday

KOZHIKODE: Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen (KNM) has cautioned against the attempts of “certain vested interests” to smuggle in organizational interests in the agitations against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The meeting of the state leaders of the KNM held here on Saturday felt that religious organizations have the duty to convince the society that the content of the anti-CAA agitations is secular.

A statement issued after the meeting exhorted those taking part in the agitation not to give any religious colour to the protests. “The agitation should not be used as an opportunity to strengthen any organization. We should be wary of the attempts to confine the citizenship issue as the problem of a community,” the statement said.

KNM believes that the Union government is more afraid of the secular content of the agitation. “The slogans that are intended as protest against the divisive forces should not be the ones that help such forces indirectly,” the statement said, adding that it is really noteworthy that women in large numbers are reacting against “the draconian law”.

The meeting also condemned the arrest and detention of those are protesting against CAA. The meeting called on all sections of the people to join the agitations, sinking party affiliations. “The directions given by the Muslim Co-ordination Committee to those participating in the agitations should followed by everyone,” the statement said.

It is learnt that the KNM raised the concern on communalizing the protests after it noticed that some organizations are trying to draw political mileage from the agitations. There are suspicions that these outfits are trying to further their own agenda through the protests. The Muslim Co-ordination Committee issued a direction to block such attempts.

KNM state president T P Abdulla Koya Madani inaugurated the meeting. General secretary M Muhammad Madani, Hussein Madavoor, H E Muhammad Babu Sait, Noor Muhammad Noorha, Swalahudeen Madani, M I Abdul Majeed Swalahi and others attended meeting.

Vadodara: A 40-year-old mother of two girls was embarrassed beyond limits when for the umpteenth time she had to send away paramedical staff of 108 GVK-EMRI from her doorstep after they had been sent there to ‘deliver her daughter’s baby’!

The horrifying prank had already happened for over two dozen times in the past one month and the woman was tired of the unnecessary harassment. For, not only was her unmarried daughter not pregnant, but also that the mischief monger was a 22-year-old youth, Praveen alias Ashwin Rawal, who wanted a romantic relationship with the much-married woman!

When she rejected Rawal’s advances, he made the prank calls to the ambulance service and rush the paramedical staff to her house.

Finally, she could take it no more and lodged a complaint against him at Nandesari police station. Cops arrested Rawal, an unemployed youth living at Angadh, for harassment, sending obscene messages and intimidating the woman.

According to the case details, Rawal had been messaging the woman for a year tryibng to woo her into having a fling with him. “He even used to call her when she ignored his messages and spurned his proposals. Upset at the rejection, Rawal sought revenge and started sending obscene text messages on her WhatsApp threatening her of dire consequences,” said the police.

Lately, the accused also started sending messages to people living in Nandesari village which irked the villagers and some were contemplating to settle the score with him their way, cops said.

When 108 ambulances started visitng the woman’s house frequently for about 20 times in a month, it created a buzz in the village after which the woman and her husband approached the police. Cops investigated the call records to the emergency services and found it to be from Rawal.

“Many from his village too had complaints against him when we went to arrest the accused,” an official said. He was produced before a judicial magistrate’s court on Friday and sent to Vadodara Central Jail as he did not seek bail, cops added.

137,['5/01/2020'],Smaller Metro stations to keep mega project on track,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Jaipur: Metro stations, which will be constructed under the Jaipur Metro Phase-II (proposed between Sitapura and Ambabari), will not be lavish and spacious as the existing ones.

To make the project financially viable, the Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) has proposed to construct small structures, which would occupy less area and need less funds.

The decision was taken after taking a cue from Delhi and Chennai. A senior JMRC official said, “In the revised detailed project report (DPR), we have proposed to construct smaller stations to reduce costs. The complete DPR of the project with revised costs will be received by mid-February.”

In the detailed project report (DPR) prepared in 2014, it was mentioned that the project required land worth Rs 875 crore and construction costs to the tune of Rs 9,500 crore. Aware of the fact that cost escalation can derail the project, JMRC and DMRC officials are trying to find out ways and means to reduce the cost. These include rationalisation of the construction and outsourcing.

A Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) official informed that not only Jaipur, there are many cities where rationalisation method has been adopted while constructing new Metro projects. There are a few ways including reducing width of the viaduct by 15%, cutting down length of metro stations, reducing size of the two metro rail depots and outsourcing fare collection system.

An official said, “It is not necessary all the methods can be applied for cost cutting in Jaipur. We would examine ways to make the project financially viable.”

The state will seek financial assistance from the Centre to construct the Phase-II corridor. Both the Centre and the state would invest 50-50% to develop the project.

After the change in regime, hope of launching the phase-II project has revived as Metro was the pet project of chief minister Ashok Gehlot in his previous tenure. The JMRC prepared its first DPR in 2011 during the Congress government’s tenure. However, the project has not seen the light of day even after seven years.

To reduce costs, the corporation has proposed to construct an elevated corridor on major part of the route. This would cut down the construction cost drastically as it is estimated that elevated corridor requires Rs 200 crore per km. The construction cost goes up to Rs 550 crore per km underground.

138,['5/01/2020'],Kerala: Government exemptions could hurt implementation says corporation,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government’s ban on single-use plastic products is failing to provide traction to the civic body’s implementation efforts, leaving many questions unanswered. The corporation’s health wing is suddenly faced with an influx of plastic carry bags labelled ‘compostable’ in the wake of the exemption granted by the state government.

The government has exempted products made from compostable plastic bearing the label ‘compostable’ and conforming to IS/ISO 17088:2008. Corporation officials are at a loss trying to distinguish between ‘compostable’ and banned plastics.

The rules define compostable plastic as one that undergoes degradation by biological processes during composting to yield CO2, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with other known compostable materials, excluding conventional petro-based plastics, and does not leave visible, distinguishable or toxic residue.

In 2009, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) sponsored a study by Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology (Cipet), Chennai for identification and evaluation of performance of biodegradable polymers in India with reference to its biodegradability under laboratory scale composting conditions as per ASTM D-6400 and IS/ISO 17088:2008.

Benefits and effects were equally analysed in the study. It was noted that promoting biodegradable plastics will increase India’s overall plastic consumption and it was opined that the major cause of concern would be to segregate between non-biodegradable and biodegradable plastics in the waste stream. The study recommended that introduction of biodegradable plastics would be helpful only if proper “eco-labelling” and “plastics coding” systems are implemented. As per the standards, biodegradable plastic should attain 60% degradation in a period of 45 days. Only a few samples tested during the study could record degradation rate of 60-67% while the other samples could only attain 4-41%.

It is this level of degradation which is posing a trouble for the corporation. While a PCB official says that sellers of compostable plastic need to obtain a registration from CPCB, the corporation is more concerned about how such a large quantity of compostable plastic could be subjected to degradation. “We are planning to collect details on suppliers of compostable plastic and the quantity being supplied by them. With regard to promised levels of degradation they have to be made accountable,’’ said a corporation official.

The exemption on disposable cups of a certain category also worries the civic body. As per the first order of the state government, all plastic-coated cups, plates, paper bags and paper bowls were banned. However, later paper cups using water-based coated sheets, which are 100% biodegradable, were exempted, following a high court order.

The study concluded that the compostable bags meeting ASTM D-5338 or IS/ISO 17088:2008 standards will degrade in a compost environment but may not break down in ambient environment. Therefore, it can be concluded that biodegradable or compostable plastics may not be a better option, it pointed out.

Mohammad Siddique, vice-president of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said authorities are making undue haste in implementing the ban and that it could result in enormous economic loss for merchants.

Panaji: GFP on Saturday said that the tourism department’s road shows have failed to improve Goa’s tourism sector and only served as “picnics” for the tourism minister ’s family. It also demanded that such road shows be banned.

Blaming the government for the slide in Goa’s tourism sector, GFP president Vijai Sardesai resurrected his “scum of the earth” jibe. “Today, the scum of the earth are getting a red carpet and we call it tourism. Our party’s clear stance is that tourism has reduced purely because of the government,” Sardesai said. “Our clear-cut demand is that there should be a ban on the road shows organised by the tourism department. Road shows are nothing but picnics organised for the tourism minister and his family,” he added.

142,['5/01/2020'],Agra University sends notice to 84 colleges for failing to provide info on BEd scam,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University

AGRA: As many as 84 colleges affiliated to Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University here have been issued notice for failing to provide information relating to the 2004-5 B.Ed scam. According to university officials, the affiliation of these colleges may get cancelled.

The management of these colleges have been asked to provide evidence of the number of approved seats, students enrolled for the B.Ed session for 2004-5, fee received, students who appeared in the exam and details of results of the candidates among other things.

On December 28, Agra University had released a list of 4,704 fake, tempered and duplicate B.Ed certificates of the 2004-05 session. The list was originally prepared by Allahabad High Court-monitored special investigation team (SIT) probing the B.Ed scam at Agra University.

The list contains names of candidates of 84 affiliated colleges in Agra and Aligarh divisions. Details have been sought from these colleges to check their role in alleged malpractices.

Varsity officials said the documents and details provided by these colleges will be verified. Those found involved in the malpractices will lose their affiliation.

According to sources, the list of 84 colleges include three private institutions which did not have the affiliation to run a B.Ed course. But marksheets were issued on the name of these colleges.

The names of the candidates with fake or duplicate certificates have been uploaded on the university website. They were shown as having passed with a first division. A majority of them had scored around 70% marks in the practical examination. The candidates had secured up to 191 marks out of 200.

Investigations revealed that some of them were close relatives of college owners.

University registrar KN Singh said, “Notices have been issued to the colleges, asking them to provide documents and details relating to B.Ed session of 2004-05. The response made by the colleges will be verified. Strict action will be taken against the colleges found involved in malpractices. Their affiliation will be cancelled.”

Earlier, the candidates with their names in the list were required to provide a report, including details on 17 points and a clarification concerning the authenticity of their B.Ed degree within 15 days. So far, no candidate has provided a clarification or details sought by the university administration.

B.Ed session 2004-05 allegedly witnessed major malpractices. Hundreds of fake marksheets were issued by over 80 self-financed colleges. During the investigation, SIT found that marks in over 2,000 marksheets were more than those awarded in the answersheets. In these cases, marks were increased after the evaluation process.

The alleged scam came to light in 2010 when a Mainpuri student, Sunil Kumar, who got second division in B.Ed and applied for another copy of the mark sheet at the university, was handed a first division result. He filed a complaint in the high court against the university. In 2014, the court formed the SIT to probe the matter.

146,['5/01/2020'],"At Bar association convention in Bijnor, issues of HC bench takes centre stage","This story is from January 5, 2020

Bijnor: Presidents of bar associations of at least 22 districts in western UP came under one roof on Saturday to attend a convention in Bijnor where they a passed a resolution, demanding a separate high court (HC) bench in Meerut.

Addressing the convention, chairman of UP’s Bar Council, Hari Shankar Singh backed the demand of lawyers, who are seeking HC bench for west UP for almost 55 years.

“I will make an appointment from Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he visits Varanasi, and will bring a delegation of the members of the action committee to put a demand for a separate bench for west UP. I am ready to help the lawyers at all level,” Singh said,

Presiding over the programme, president of central action committee for west UP high court bench, Mange Ram, said, “When Maharashtra with a population of 11.42 crores can have three benches, why not west UP.”

Elaborating their strategy, Ram said, “We have decided to raise an awareness campaign to make people aware about the importance of having a high court bench in western UP, so that they can join our stir. Therefore, we have decided to put up awareness banners, posters and hoardings at the collectorate and other public places.”

The convention was organized under the supervision of Bijnor association president SK Babali and secretary Navdeep Singh at the district bar association hall, in which lawyers raised their local demands as well.

Representatives from all the parties were invited to the convention. Three MPs, two from BSP and one from SP, did not turn up for the event. Whereas SP MLA Manoj Paras and RLD leaders attended it.

Talking to TOI, former present of district bar association, Praveen Singh Dehswal, said, “This is a 55-year-old demand. People are tired of travelling over 550km to reach to Prayagraj and Lucknow for their hearings. Over 50 % of the total cases go to high court from western UP. Lawyers of HC oppose our movement and fear of losing their big chunk of clients. We have been getting assurances from the past and the present government, but could not proceed forward. This time, we have the same party ruling at the state and Centre. They should heed to the grievances of the people of west UP.”

Last month, Meerut MP Rajendra Agrawal had raised the issue in Lok Sabha and advocated resolution to form a HC bench in western UP. At that time he said, “The justice is right of common men. Where will he go? UP government had recommended a bench in 1955, but the advocates of the high court always exert pressure not to allow bench here in western UP. In fact, there should be three benches in UP, considering the state’s huge population.”

Replying to this, Union law and justice minister, Ravi Shankar Prashad told the house that a bench in western UP was possible only after a recommendation from the full bench of high court coupled with the infrastructure to house it.

Sources added that the process of recovery of taxes by way of disconnecting drainage and sewerage lines in residential properties would begin from next week.

148,['5/01/2020'],Priyanka and Rahul sparked violence: Shah,"This story is from January 5, 2020

New Delhi: BJP national president Amit Shah on Sunday accused Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra of “misleading” people on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and “instigating” violence during the anti-CAA protests.

The Union home minister tried to assure Muslims that the new law had no provision of taking away the citizenship of minorities.

In a clear indication that BJP would make CAA one of its poll agendas for the Delhi assembly elections, Shah launched a door-to-door campaign in south Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar, which is largely inhabited by people who migrated from Pakistan after partition, to drum up support for the new Act. He visited eight houses, a jhuggi and a temple and distributed pamphlets explaining the features of CAA.

Shah’s visit also witnessed protests with a couple of girls shouting “We reject CAA” and putting up posters with “Shame NRC” and “Azaadi” written on them.

Addressing booth-level workers at IGI Stadium earlier, Shah said the opposition leaders were spreading “lies” about CAA and asked partymen to carry out an intensive campaign to inform the masses about its features.

“Kejriwal misled people. Congress, especially Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, misled people and instigated riots. I want to ask people if they want a government in Delhi that instigates riots due to its vote-bank politics,” Shah said.

Referring to a recent attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib by a mob in Pakistan, Shah asked opposition leaders to “open their eyes” to the atrocities against minorities in the neighbouring country. “This is an answer to all those opposing CAA. Tell me, if the Sikhs who were attacked at Gurdwara Nankana Sahib will not come to India, then where they will go?” he asked.

Calling Kejriwal and Gandhis “anti-Dalits” for opposing the amended Act, Shah said its beneficiaries were largely Dalits and the poor. “The Prime Minister came up with CAA. It was approved by the Cabinet and Parliament passed it,” he said.

The BJP leader also claimed that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had extended her support to rioters by saying that she would visit the houses of those who had carried out the riots. He asked people to give missed calls to a toll free number put out by BJP to show their support to CAA. He also slammed the rumours that the number belonged to a video streaming website.

Thrissur: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on Saturday slammed chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for his silence even as governor Arif Mohammed Khan was “continuously denigrating the decisions taken by the assembly”.

“I fail to understand why Vijayan is afraid of the governor. He should at least display the boldness demonstrated by CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. The chief minister, who is the leader of the House, has not yet spoken up even though so many days have lapsed after the governor slighted the resolution against Citizenship Amendment Act passed by the assembly. The silence of Vijayan is suspicious. He should not be trying to be in the good books of the governor, who has crossed the boundaries of all propriety expected from a person holding an important constitutional position,’’ said Chennithala during a news conference here.

The opposition leader asserted that the assembly was well within its rights to pass the resolution against CAA, which was against the basic tenets of the Constitution.

On the reports that a privilege motion is being moved against the chief minister in Parliament, Chennithala said: “If a privilege notice is moved in the Rajya Sabha, it can only be sent the state assembly. And, there can be no other action on it.”

“On January 30, UDF will form a human map of India in all 14 districts,” Chennithala said, adding that there would no more joint agitation with CPM.

Bijnor: Two experts from Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) arrived here on Saturday to aide the forest department authorities to capture the elusive leopardess which is believed to have killed three of the five people in the district since November 27. Pugmarks have proved that the same animal killed three of the five people in Bijnor tehsil over the past few weeks. Scores of people have also been injured in leopard attacks in the region. People have reported sighting leopards amid the cane fields.

People in the rural areas have been on the edge as the killer leopard is yet to be captured. Their fear also stems from the fact that it is harvesting time for cane crop and they have to go to their fields for the purpose.

The killer big cat is suspected to be hiding amid cane fields in a one-km radius of Mohandiya village close to Malan river.

According to Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran, two WII experts -- Salvador and Dushyant Rai -- who inspected the area suggested that forest authorities install 10 more camera traps. They advised that chicken, mutton and dog meat besides eggs be placed in and around the cages kept to trap the leopard. The smell of raw meat will lure the animal to the cages, they added.

Till now, forest authorities were keeping live dogs and goat as bait inside the cages to trap it.

Several cages and camera traps have been set up one-km radius of Mohandiya village close to Malan river. That the killer big cat is a leopardess was captured by the cameras. However, it has not entered any of the cages set up to trap it. Forest authorities have also sought permission from a top officer to tranquilize it and are planning to hire three elephants trained for combing sugarcane fields.

Congress leader Raashid Alvi

AGRA: A group of Congress leaders, including Raashid Alvi and Panna Lal Punia along with scores of party workers, met the family members of December 20 anti-CAA violence victims and prime accused Faraz Khan, and extended all possible help.

Party’s national spokesperson Punia said, “We met the families and came to know that they have not received autopsy reports of those who died in December 20 violence. The report will help us expedite the case for a government compensation. People narrated their ordeal to us. Hence, we helped them connect with our veteran party leader Salman Khurshid over phone for legal aid.”

Azad Khan (43), uncle of Faraz Khan who has been accused by police for leading violent anti-CAA protests, said, “The Congress leaders heard us patiently. I also spoke to Salman Khurshid over phone and he offered to provide legal expertise in Faraz’s case. My nephew has been wrongly framed, he is just a 19-year-old boy. His life will be destroyed if he is not rescued on time. We have evidence to prove his innocence in a court of law.”

Mohammad Ayub, father of deceased Navee Jaan, said, “Like others, I too haven’t received the postmortem report of my son. I’m not aware of the procedure to obtain it. The Congress leaders have assured me that they will help me in fighting against police brutalities. He was the sole breadwinner of our family.”

Zaki Sheikh, brother-in-law of Haroon (33) who succumbed in Delhi due to injuries sustained on December 20, said, “No political party leader came to meet us. However, authorities have informed us that autopsy report is yet to arrive from AIIMS Delhi.”

Firozabad superintendent of police (city) Prabal Pratap Singh said, “We are yet to receive the autopsy reports of those who died in Delhi. For the ones done in Firozabad, the families have not submitted applications yet. We will help them in this regard.”

Vadodara: Two doctors booked in the path lab scam in Vadu appeared before the police after obtaining anticipatory bail from the Gujarat high court. The duo – Dr Sunil Surve and Dr Manish Hadiya – remained present at the Vadu police station on Friday morning as the high court had directed them to as one of the bail conditions.

After interrogation, the police allowed the duo to go. “We did not got much details of the case from them and so we will call them again for questioning. If they continue to not cooperate, we will seek their remand,” said a police official. Surve, a pathologist at GMERS Medical College and Hospital-Gotri, was booked after his signatures were found in the reports at Swara Path Lab which was sealed by the health department after the scam came to light.

158,['5/01/2020'],Ex-IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan held by Agra police on way to AMU,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan

AGRA: Former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan, who quit the services over curbs in Jammu & Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370, was detained by Agra police while he was on his way to Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) to deliver a speech on CAA and NRC. Gopinathan was invited by the AMU Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) to express his views at a public discussion on CAA, NPR and NRC.

Gopinathan, who had tweeted on Saturday afternoon that he had been detained from the UP border, near Agra, was released late on Saturday evening.

Gopinathan later told TOI that he was escorted by the Agra police to the UP border, even after he was told that he had been released on a personal bond. He said, “I was detained without any reason.”

He said, “I have never made any provocative speech. Why was I illegally detained? I told them this was a kidnapping. The police personnel did not take me to the police station. First they took me to a dhaba and then to the dak bungalow,” he said.

Alleging that the government was scared of being questioned, the former IAS officer said, “They aren’t allowing anyone to speak. The government is scared of dissent and dubs any kind of educated dissent ‘urban naxalism’.”

According to Agra administration, Gopinathan was detained at Saiyan toll plaza on Agra-Gwalior highway and was taken to a rest house (dak bungalow) in Kheragarh.

Though Aligarh district magistrate refused to comment on the issue, a letter issued by the district administration to the police said, “In order to maintain law and order in the city, Gopinathan should not be allowed to enter Aligarh.” The letter also stated that there is a “possibility of disruption of peace after Gopinathan’s address to students, as it had happened earlier”.

The letter mentioned how violence had erupted on AMU campus on December 15, following speeches by Dr Kafeel Khan, the lecturer who was suspended from the department of paediatrics at BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur, and activist and political analyst Yogendra Yadav on the campus on CAA two days earlier.

Later, talking to TOI, activist Kavita Krishnan, who was also invited by AMU students to speak on CAA, criticized the government’s move and wondered under what law Gopinathan was detained.

“It is atrocious. He did not commit a crime,” said Krishnan, adding that not only his movement was prevented but his phone was also taken away. “If this could happen to a former IAS officer then imagine what the government will do with the minorities,” said Krishnan.

AMU students’ leader Faizul Hassan said, “Gopinathan was singled out by the district administration as he is aware of the government policies and could have exposed the government on its lies on CAA.”

Gopinathan was the secretary, power department of the Union Territories of Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli when he resigned August 21 last year over the denial of “freedom of expression” to the people of Jammu and Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370.

The 32-year-old 2012-batch IAS officer had first come into limelight when he hid his identity and joined in relief work during the 2018 Kerala floods.

KANPUR: Kanpur Metro completed the casting of first pier of the 8.9-Km priority corridor being built from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur to Moti Jheel . The work ended on the last day of December.

In total, Kanpur Metro has to construct 295 piers for the viaduct and 198 piers for nine stations in the priority section.

Public relations department of UPMRC said the Kanpur Metro team has cast the first pier cap of priority corridor. It stated that the work was completed on the eve of New Year.

It also stated that team of UP Metro Rail Corporation has worked day and night to achieve this feat in just three months. “It is a wonderful achievement by the team of Kanpur Metro,” UPMRC managing director, Kumar Keshav. said while lauding the team.

With this, the construction work of Kanpur Metro is gathering pace. The construction agency is working day and night between IIT-Kanpur and Kalyanpur Metro route. For this, barricades have already been put from IIT-Kanpur gate and traffic has been diverted.

Also, the work at the Government Polytechnic for construction of Metro yard is going on. This bears importance for the fact that the Kanpur Metro would be stationed here for maintenance work.

It is expected that the work of construction of Metro yard would finish before the construction of pillars and the raised platforms to enable it to run.

The Kanpur Metro is expected to start running by the end of year 2021 or in January 2022. In the first phase, it will run between IIT-K and Motijheel in Swaroop Nagar. On this route, Metro will run overhead. Nine stations would be made on this route.

However, after commissioning of Kanpur Metro between the two identified ends, the work would be carried out further. In the first route, Kanpur Metro is to run up to Naubasta from IIT-Kanpur.

But, between Motijheel and Naubasta, while some stations would be elevated, others would be underground.

162,['5/01/2020'],Don’t subject education to politics: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal attends the PTM at a Delhi government school on Rouse Avenue

NEW DELHI: Saba Parveen’s elder son has been studying in a Delhi government school on Rouse Avenue in central Delhi for four years. She described the school as a “khandahar”, or a ruin, when she admitted him in Class IV. “The school has changed for the better in a very short time,” said Parveen, now the proud mother of a Class VII student. She was at the school on Saturday to attend the parents-teachers meeting (PTM) organised across the city by Delhi government.

The PTM had run into a controversy after Union health minister and BJP leader Harsh Vardhan requested lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to postpone the event so as not to subject the children to the cold. The Aam Aadmi Party government responded by sticking to the schedule. In fact, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal himself was at the Rouse Avenue school to press the point.

“How can imparting good education to our children be a political gimmick?” Kejriwal wondered at the function. “We have been holding PTMs for two-three years now. Our rivals tried to end these PTMs, but I don’t think subjecting schooling and education to politics is justified.”

The CM had one-on-one interactions with parents and exhorted them to ensure that their children completed schooling and did not “leave midway”.

Gaurav Yadav, originally from Azamgarh in UP, whose two children study in the school, said the changes and improvements brought in Delhi’s education set-up were commendable. “I will vote for you again because I am very happy with the improvements,” he told Kejriwal. “My son, who could not read properly, is now fluent in both Hindi and English. Friends from other states also appreciate your work.”

A parent shared that he had moved his two children out of a private school to the government institution. Another parent, Dharam Veer Singh, said, “If my child bunks school, I am informed about it immediately by the teachers. They are more involved with our children now, and so are we.” He said the facilities and teaching in the government school at Anand Vihar that his daughter attends are equally good.

When deputy CM Manish Sisodia visited a school in Dwarka, he told the students, “Don’t be a dishonest doctor, engineer, officer or lawyer. And don’t forget your parents when you grow professionally.”

Representative image

CUTTACK: Uncertainty over the filling up of vacancies in posts of judges in the Orissa high court looks to continue indefinitely as chief justice K S Jhaveri retired on Saturday without recommending any fresh names for appointment to the Supreme Court collegium. President Ram Nath Kovind has appointed Kumari Justice Sanju Panda as the acting chief justice of the high court.

The high court collegium had last recommended 10 names (four judicial officers and eight advocates) on May 7, 2019. But on October 3, 2019, the Supreme Court cleared the names of only one judicial officer and one advocate. Subsequently, the Centre endorsed the name of the judicial officer only.

The high court collegium, which recommends names for appointment of judges, comprises the chief justice and two seniormost judges. Chief justice Jhaveri had reportedly tried to hold collegium meetings to decide on recommendation of names on his last two working days. But the collegium meetings were not possible as both the seniormost judges remained absent on Thursday and one of them remained absent on Friday.

As the collegium failed to recommend names to the Supreme Court, the process cannot be undertaken for at least another six months. As per norms, the new chief justice cannot recommend names as part of the collegium before a lapse of six months from his assuming office.

The problem of vacancies in posts of judges in the high court has persisted as only three judges have been appointed in the past nearly five years. Consequently, the high court continues to function with 48 per cent judicial vacancy.

Though the high court has a sanctioned strength of 27, currently there are just 13 judges with the chief justice’s retirement.

Official sources said though 24 names were recommended by the high court collegium in the past two years, only three names were cleared by the Supreme Court collegium. And only two were endorsed by the Centre for appointment.

Persisting vacancies in large number have been creating difficulty in tackling the backlog and creating resentment amongst the advocates on matters not being taken up for months.

Stricter regulations in traditional markets like US and the European Union (EU), changing consumer requirements and evolving trade scenario have resulted in lower exports.Gujarat’s marine exports dipped to $798 million (approximately Rs 5,666 crore) in 2018-19 from $843 million in 2017-18, according to a report by Drip Capital, a US-based trade finance company.According to the Marine Products Exports Development Authority (MPEDA) under the Union ministry of commerce and industry, Gujarat’s marine exports in volume terms plunged from 3,12,568 tonnes in 2017-18 to 3,05,326 tonnes in 2018-19.The exports are likely to be lower in 2019-20 as extended monsoon and multiple cyclone warnings shortened the fishing season and led to a 40% decline in annual fish catch.“The EU and the US are major markets for Indian marine products. However, their regulations and import guidelines are very stringent. If one consignment is rejected, other buyers shy away from placing their orders,” said Rajan Kumar, a scientist at Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), Veraval.Increase in countervailing duty by developed countries from time to time also affects Indian exports. Industry players opine that stiff competition from Vietnam and Thailand in shrimp exports has also affected marine exports from Gujarat.“Pollution has adversely affected our catch and led to lower exports. The industrial units on the coast of South Gujarat and Porbandar release untreated water into the sea causing a decline in fish catch,” added Bharat Modi, president, Porbandar Machimar Boat Association.According to the Directorate-General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) India exported nearly $6.3 billion (around Rs 45,000 crore) worth of marine products in FY19. Shrimp, frozen fish and mollusks are major export commodities, with shrimp contributing 71% of the exports.Gujarat ranks first and second in exports of fish and mollusks, respectively. The US market alone accounts for 50% of Gujarat’s fish exports. Coastal towns of Veraval and Porbandar are the two major centres of marine trade in Gujarat. Ribbon fish, cuttlefish, croaker fish, squid and shrimps are some of the popular varieties exported from here.However, the marine exports have grown at a compounded annual growth of rate 10% since fiscal 2015-16. Stating that much of the slowdown stems from EU and to an extent the US, the Drip Capital further recommends that Indian exporters should look at new and alternative markets for their shipments.Buoyed by a resurgent economy, China is likely to be the single largest market to tap into in the coming months. Additionally, other Asian markets like Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan will also become increasingly important in the time to come.

Indra Park is among the 5 parks in Sec’bad to come under EVDM wing

SECUNDERABAD: Indira Park , one of the city’s most popular parks , located near the Lower Tank Bund, will now also be a secure spot, thanks to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ’s decision to upgrade security at the site.

The reason behind the security upgrade has been attributed to the rise in the number of encroachments at the park. In addition to Indira Park, 46 other parks have been handed over to GHMC’s enforcement, vigilance and disaster management (EVDM) wing. The wing has been asked to deploy security and keep round-the-clock vigil in addition to installing high-end CCTV cameras.

Of the 46 parks, five major parks Indira Park, Sundariaha Park, Clock Tower Park, Bathukamma Ghat, and Green Stretch on Tank Bundcome under North Zone in Secunderabad .

“Since all these five parks are well-known tourist spots and witness heavy footfalls, it has become imperative to keep vigil from a security point of view. Moreover, hundreds of locals visit the park in the wee hours of morning to walk and exercise. There are chances that these parks may become centres for illegal activities. The EVDM wing has decided to take over to prevent such untoward activities,” sources in EVMD told STOI.

With regards to Indira Park a massive security upgrade has to be planned involving the development of private security as well as installation of adequate cameras. The park that is spread over 69 acres, houses a rock garden, a lake and has date palms and sandalwood trees. Adequate security will be deployed to see that no part of the park falls prey to encroachments, said the sources. “We are working on the modalities of appointing private security personnel and in a month or two, the security system will be implemented and updated in all these parks,” said sources in EVDM wing.

Viswajeeth Kampati, director of the EVDM wing, GHMC, “There is proposal to set up an Anti-Encroachment Cell to prevent encroachments in the city parks. A toll-free number will be allotted and citizens can contact us through the number if they spot any encroachments. We will kept the informant’s whereabouts confidential. The Cell will , most likely, begin to function in a month’s time.”

VADODARA: Four persons went off on a rampaging spree on Friday night beating up a trader in the Marimata No Khancho on Rajmahal Road and vandalizing shops.

The traders in the locality, which is a popular area for mobile phone accessories and electronic items, kept the market shut on Saturday to protest the vandalism.

According to the police, the four accused — Vishnu Kahar, Naval, Dhruv and Kishor — entered the narrow lane at around 9.45 pm armed with weapons and sticks. The hoodlums first went to the shop of one Mohandas Lakhani asking him why his shop was still open. Before Lakhani could comprehend the intention, Kahar broke the glass of a counter in the shop and then went to another shop where they broke a television.

The four then went to three other shops selling mobile phones and broke counters there too. When they entered another shop owned by Dhovaram Purohit for vandalism, Purohit intervened and was beaten up by them.

After traders came out and intervened, the four accused went away from the spot. The traders then quickly shut their shops and later decided to keep the market closed on Saturday to protest.

A rally was taken out on Saturday, after which Lakhani registered a complaint against the four goons at Raopura police station accusing them of assault, hurling abuses and causing damage. Based on the complaint, Kahar and Naval were arrested late on Saturday night while they are hunting for Dhruv and Kishor.

“We are grilling the two accused in our custody to know what spurted the vandalism. The shop owners also do not know the goons and the sudden vandalism surprised all the traders,” said a police official.

A probe into the complaint was carried out by ASP (rural) Sansaar, on the instructions of SSP Pandey. It found the SI guilty of accepting the bribe. The SHO was also suspended as he is responsible for all acts of officials working under his command. An FIR has been registered against both.

In the interim, the charge of Bhuta police station was handed over by SSP Pandey to Ravindra Singh. He also transferred 19 SIs and 103 constables from reserve police lines to various police stations in Bareilly as part of the order.

The incident was reported on the night of October 14 in Bhuta when SI Harikesh Singh was on highway patrol on Bareilly-Bisalpur state highway. He stopped a truck during routine checking and recovered IMFL smuggled from Haryana inside it. Instead of seizing the truck and arresting the driver, Harikesh demanded Rs 5 lakh from the driver, eventually settling for Rs 2.5 lakh. The driver spoke with the owner of the consignment and arranged Rs 1.82 lakh in cash, and transferred the remaining amount to a bank account Harikesh provided. The truck was released, but soon after it entered Bisalpur, adjacent to Bhuta, police again stopped the truck and seized the liquor consignment.

SSP Pandey told TOI, “Prima facie, we have direct evidence against SI Harikesh Singh that he accepted the bribe, which is why I have suspended him. There is no direct evidence against SHO Rajveer Singh, but he is in-charge of the police station, so he is accountable for his subordinate’s act. I have ordered filing of an FIR against both.”

TOI tried contacting SHO Rajveer Singh but he was not available for comment.

This is the fourth case from Bareilly in the past month, when cops were suspended for demanding bribe. On December 10, the SSP had suspended two SIs and two constables for seeking Rs 7 lakh from a village head in Aliganj. Two constables from the Dial 112 team were also suspended for demanding Rs 800 from a labourer for acting on his complaint. On January 2, the SSP suspended an SI and two constables for attempting to extort money from a mill owner, using CCTV footage as threat.

170,['5/01/2020'],Shortage of ICU beds concerns Vimsar docs,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Sambalpur: The Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (Vimsar), Burla, is facing an acute shortage of ICU beds. Though Vimsar is the biggest healthcare centre in this region, and has more than 1,000 beds, only 14 beds have ICU facility.

The shortage of ICU beds has prompted the Junior Doctor Association (JDA) of the hospital to express concern. “At least 10% of the total bed strength of the hospital should be for ICU patients. By that calculation, Vimsar should have at least 100 ICU beds,” said president of JDA, Sanjeev Mishra.

Mishra explained that many patients were referred to Vimsar’s ICU every day but were forced to go to private hospitals because of the lack of enough beds. “In private hospitals, the poor patients get denied government schemes. They are left to the mercy of god,” he said, adding that the union had drawn the attention of development commissioner Suresh Mohapatra to the problem.

Mishra also said the hospital authorities had the infrastructure to add six more ICU beds but weren’t being able to do so because of the absence of ventilators. “The authorities of Vimsar had asked the Odisha State Medical Corporation Limited (OSMCL) for the ventilators around three months ago but the machines are yet to arrive,” he said.

Dean in-charge and principal of Vimsar Braja Mohan Mishra said the tender process for the procurement of the ventilators had been completed. “However, we are yet to get the ventilators. We are hopeful that OSMCL will give us six machines at the earliest so that we can increase our ICU bed count to 20,” he said, adding that he had written to the government several times seeking at least 50 ICU beds.

BAREILLY: A 30-year-old man who was bitten by a stray dog some 40 days ago died on Friday evening while he was being taken to Lucknow for treatment.

The deceased was identified as Jhamman Lal Kashyap, a daily-wage labourer. According to his family, he was bitten by a stray dog when he was working in a field at Peepal Wali Gotiya village under Cantonment police station of Bareilly district.

Jhamman’s older brother, Suresh Kashyap, said he was administered anti-rabies vaccine after he was bitten by the dog. However, he could not say when he was given the anti-rabies shot or how many shots he had been administered. It is mandatory to be administered the first vaccine within 24 hours after being bitten by a rabid animal.

Soon he was taken ill and was undergoing treatment in a hospital at Rudrapur in Uttarakhand, where he was diagnosed as suffering from rabies , said Suresh. “He returned home on Thursday and his condition deteriorated. He was not eating properly and was avoiding drinking water. We took him to the district hospital in Bareilly, where doctors who examined him at the out-patient department said his condition was serious and referred him to higher facility in Lucknow.”

He added, “We were on way to Lucknow when my brother breathed his last in Shahjahanpur.”

The deceased is survived by four minor children.

Jhamman’s postmortem was conducted on Saturday. Dr RK Gupta, one of the doctors to conduct the autopsy, said, “The family claimed that Jhamman was diagnosed with rabies. However, we could not ascertain the cause of death during the autopsy. We have preserved the viscera sample.”

Bhubaneswar: The Puri-Hatia Tapaswini Express got delayed by more than six hours on Saturday due to technical snag, causing problem for passengers, including former Union tribal affairs minister and Sundargarh MP Jual Oram, who was travelling from Bhubaneswar to Rourkela. The delay upset Oram to such an extent that he tweeted about it and also tagged BJP colleague and railway minister Piyush Goyal to the post.

The train left Puri at 7.55 pm on Thursday and reached Angul at the scheduled time of 12.53 am. Trouble started soon after the train left Angul. It got stranded for over three hours after the engine developed a snag. It reached Boinda, the next station, at 4.55 am on Saturday. At Bamur station, the train stopped for a second time. This time it took more than tree hours to fix the engine problem. The train reached Rairakhol at 8.56 am, instead of its scheduled time of 2.10 am, a delay of six hours and 24 minutes. The train finally reached its destination Hatia, in neighbouring Jharkhand, at 5.35 pm, late by six-and-a-half hours.

Oram was travelling in AC first class along with P K Mishra, the Khetarpal Sampark Pramukh of RSS. Oram said the train got stranded for over six hours between Angul and Bamur stations. “I got down at Rourkela after the train left Bamur with the engine problem fixed,” said Oram, who reached Rourkela at 1.24 pm instead of the scheduled 7.25 am.

Pradeep Kumar, divisional railway manager Sambalpur, wrote in his official twitter handle that the train got delayed due to engine trouble. “Matter is under inquiry for further course of action. We sincerely regret the issue,” he added.

An East Coast Railway spokesperson said the train had to be stopped as smoke was coming out of the train engine. “We ran the train only after fixing the problem,” he said.

173,['5/01/2020'],Another market to go pedestrian-friendly in Delhi,"Krishna Nagar market area

NEW DELHI: The Krishna Nagar market will get a new look from Monday with East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) starting to implement the project for pedestrianisation and parking management on a 1.3km stretch.The project includes restriction of vehicles on Lal Quarter Road (From Chachi Building to Ghondli Chowk) from 11am to 9pm, shifting around 441 vehicles parked on this stretch during the peak hour and a few neighbouring ones to other areas and allowing one-way movement of traffic on certain roads.“Now the movement of vehicles on Lal Quarter Road will be restricted permanently and to regulate the arrangements, we have engaged 10 guards. They will ensure that people do not park or drive vehicles on Lal Quarter Road. In case of violations, these guards will be allowed to arrange for towing of vehicles and informing the traffic police or corporation staff for challan as per norms,” said a senior EDMC official.Besides marking parking spaces using yellow paints, EDMC claimed to have added various facilities in the area. “We have installed benches, signage, planters, dustbins and ornamental lights after colouring these stretches. The idea is to make the place people-friendly,” said an official.EDMC standing committee chairman Sandeep Kapoor said alternative arrangements had been made for shopkeepers and residents. “Though many of these vehicles are unlikely to be there during the day, we have identified eight alternative sites for four- and two-wheelers on Satnam Road, at Central Park and along the boundary of a government school. Additional vehicles will go to the multilevel parking lot,” he added.“We will issue these vehicle owners stickers with the help of the residents’ welfare and market associations to distinguish them from the visitors’ vehicles, who will be allowed to park in multilevel parking lots,” said Kapoor.However, the implementation is going to be a challenging task as some traders, during the trial run, had opposed the idea of restricting vehicular traffic on the main commercial road. “People need to understand that the project is for their benefit and will only help to increase the footfall in future,” said a civic official. “We had several rounds of meetings with common people and the traders’ bodies, and expect full support from them. The project is being implemented on the direction of the Supreme Court,” he added.The traffic police will deploy the maximum number of staff to ensure minimum violation at the beginning. “They will provide assistance, including barricading the pedestrianised roads and ensuring one-way movement on connecting roads. Once the visitors and shopkeepers become habituated, the 10 security guards will manage the arrangements. They will be paid by the concessionaire who will run the surface parking lots,” said a civic official.EDMC will also talk to the market associations to start e-rickshaws from the nearby metro station to dissuade people from bringing their own vehicles. In the second phase, a parking management plan for the residential areas will be made.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73104365,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-231900,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/another-market-to-go-pedestrian-friendly/articleshow/73103918.cms

Surat: What is common to the world’s tallest building Burj Khalifa, Palm Jumeirah in Dubai and Nurai Island of Abu Dhabi? Apart from being iconic sites, they owe their greenery to a small village called Ambheta of Navsari district in Gujarat.For beautification and landscaping, these modern miracles have used trees, saplings and plants supplied by Samir Farms and Nursery located in this nondescript village of southern Gujarat.“Some of the trees for Burj Khalifa and the Dubai prince’s garden were supplied from our nursery. Even Kesar mango trees have been supplied there. We started exporting nursery products to Dubai 15 years ago,” said Samir Vashi, 44, owner of the nursery. “Nowadays, consumers ask for fully grown trees such as 10-year-old mango trees or coconut trees with fruits on them so that they can replant them. We grow such trees and supply them to end users,” Vashi said, adding, “We have supplied 3,000 such coconut trees for the Tiger Woods Golf Course in Dubai.”This fourth-generation plant nursery owner had never visited his family’s nursery before graduation. However, he has made his mark in the world of commercial landscaping.Even Bollywood celebrities like Amir Khan and Dharmendra and cricketers like Navjot Singh Sidhu and Yusuf Pathan have sourced plants from Vashi’s nursery. Corporate houses like Reliance Group also turn to Vashi for plants and saplings.Vashi’s nursery is spread over 150 acres on Gandevi Road in Bilimora taluka, some 60km from Surat city. The 300 workers here grow more than 3,000 plant varieties. The nursery also specializes in ready-to-be-replanted trees.Apart from big palm, coconut or mango trees, the nursery supplies saplings and plants for varieties like chikoo, mango, rose, mogra, lily as well as creepers like Madhumalti.The Vashi family has been running a plant nursery for 140 years and Samir’s father Anil received a lifetime achievement award from Indian Nursery Association in 2015.“The love for plants runs in our veins. Growing competition has kept us striving to achieve new landmarks,” added Vashi.Last year, Vashi started a new venture called Garden Art, which supplied nursery and artificial plants and indoor pots for beautification around the Statue of Unity, Kevadia.Samir said, “I visited an ITC hotel for the first time 20 years ago. It was my childhood dream to live in such five-star hotels and dine there. After watching the grand landscape and décor of that hotel, I decided to enter the profession full time.” He added, “Before that I had not visited our family nursery, but on my return, I went there and have stayed in the business since then.”“We don’t depend on export business and our focus is on the domestic market. At present I am exploring the possibility of importing a mango variety from South Africa which will do wonders in our climate,” Vashi added.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73103958,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-173774,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ambheta-village-paints-green-landscapes-for-the-high-and-mighty/articleshow/73103922.cms

Representational Image

PILIBHIT: The mysterious death of a three-day-old baby has brought the rift between a couple out in the open with each accusing the other of murdering the newborn. Police are awaiting the autopsy report before registering an FIR.

The police sent the body for an autopsy on Saturday after she was declared brought dead by doctors at the district hospital here.

On Friday evening, police were summoned by neighbours to a house in Kahshi Ram Awas Vikas colony near Eidgah under Sungarhi police station. They took charge of the body and took it to hospital.

When police went to the house, they found the couple, Mohammad Saqir Ansari and Phool Bi, squabbling over the baby’s death and accusing each other of murder. In fact, the uproar by the couple attracted neighbours who assembled at the house to find the baby dead. Someone informed police about the death.

According to Shaqir, he had gone to the market to make some purchases in the evening. When he returned home, she was dead. His wife was sitting by the body. He alleged that Phool Bi was mentally disturbed and had killed their daughter by strangling her. Denying the allegations, Phool Bi claimed that her husband had killed the baby.

Rajesh Kumar, SHO, said police were waiting for the autopsy report. Further action in the matter would be decided on the basis of the report’s findings, he added.

Meanwhile, a neighbour, Bablu, told mediapersons that he had offered to adopt the baby as her parents were poor and were incapable of taking proper care of the newborn. Shaqir, a rickshawpuller, was an alcoholic and spent most of his daily earnings on liquor. Shaqir had demanded Rs 15,000 for handing over the baby to Bablu so that he could use the money to get his wife treated for her mental ailment. Following the demand for money, Bablu dropped the idea of adopting the baby. The baby could have been saved had Sahqir accepted his adoption offer without demanding money, Bablu said.

NEW DELHI: 8866288662. That’s the phone number Amit Shah asked supporters on Friday to give a missed call to drum up support for Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Now several Twitter users, mostly from unverified handles, have been using a variety of dubious ways — asking for a date, offering free Netflix subscription, promising a free ride on a Merc — in their bid to make people dial that number.One Muralikrishna from Hyderabad posted on Twitter from the unverified handle, @MuralikrishnaE1, “Want free Netflix subscription for 6 months? Call 8866288662 and get Username and Password. Promotional offer, valid only for first 1000 callers. Try your luck.” Netflix India was quick to respond. “This is absolutely fake. If you want free Netflix please use someone else’s account like the rest of us,” the video streaming company posted from its official handle.Pawan Durani tweeted from his verified handle, “Those who want Virat Kohli to be nominated as the best cricketer of the year may give a missed call to 8866288662 #ICC”. He also retweeted and deleted later a tweet which said: Next two hours Sunny leone (sic) would be live, speak to her on 8866288662. At least one such user, Aanchal, who goes by the handle, @followanchal, is followed by PM Narendra Modi . She posted, “Akele ho?

BAREILLY: Nearly 50 villagers, including a few women, staged a protest outside the SP city’s office in Bareilly against a 32-year-old-woman of their village who had filed a rape case against 4 identified and 35 unidentified people in Bareilly’s Cantonment police station in December 2019.

The villagers alleged that the woman filed a fake rape case after her husband was asked to repay Rs 2.50 lakh borrowed from these 39 people. The protesters later met the circle officer Ashok Kumar and were assured of an impartial investigation in the case.

Earlier, the rape survivor had written to senior superintendent of police (SSP), Bareilly, Shailesh Pandey, claiming that the villagers are forcing her to leave the village after she had filed a rape complaint.

“Everyone in the village is aware that the woman’s husband is a drunkard, and that he had borrowed money from several people. He had promised to return the money after selling his property. But, when he sold his property and was asked to return the money, he used his wife to file a fake complaint. We all are ready to give our statement. Police must provide justice,” said Ajay Kumar, the village head.

Talking to TOI, SSP Pandey said, “The investigation is currently underway. We have assured them that the probe will be done on facts and proofs and ensured that no innocent person goes to jail.”

On December 17, the rape survivor met SSP Bareilly and filed a complaint where she claimed that she was thrashed and gang-raped by Amit, Shambhu, Chaman, and Pushpendra. She also alleged that these men also shot a video of the assault and later forced her to sleep with 35 others for the past one-year.

She had also alleged that one of the accused, Amit, stole Rs 50,000 from her house.

Based on the complaint, police later filed an FIR against Amit, Shambhu, Chaman, Pushpendra and 35 unidentified people under IPC sections 376-D (gang-rape), 392 (robbery), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and section 66 of the Information and Technology Act.

The rape survivor was later sent for medical examination, but none of the accused have been arrested so far. The police have not received the examination report as well.

On December 23, the survivor visited the SSP office and alleged that the villagers were forcing her to leave the village. Police later reached the village and spoke with the locals and asked them not to trouble her.

BHUBANESWAR: The BJD’s stance remains unchanged on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

A day after Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to 11 non-BJP CMs, including Odisha’s Naveen Patnaik , to mop up support against CAA, the ruling regional party here on Saturday said there is no change in its stated stand.

“As has already been stated by our chief minister, we support the CAA and oppose the NRC. There is no change in our stand,” BJD spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Sasmit Patra told TOI on Saturday.

During a debate on CAB in Parliament, Patra and Lok Sabha member Sarmistha Sethi had sought to delink CAA and NRC while extending BJD’s support to CAA. Naveen had on December 18 announced that his party would not support NRC. In his letter, Vijayan drew the attention of CMs to the resolution passed by the Kerala assembly seeking the repeal of CAA on December 31 and requested them to consider similar steps. “The need of the hour is unity among all Indians who wish to protect and preserve our cherished value of democracy and secularism,” the Kerala CM wrote.

BJD insiders said from the time the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) was introduced in Parliament, the regional party was very clear about supporting it as “the same has nothing against Indian citizens.” BJD insiders said the party doesn’t want to be part of the Congress-led campaign against CAA. As such people’s response to CAA in Odisha has not been adverse though minority community members have expressed their apprehension about NRC, he said.

Bareilly: Specially-abled children suffering from hearing and speech impairment can learn how to use computers. Beginning this Monday, special computer classes will be held for these children, according to chief development officer Satyendra Kumar.

“I have personally met these children and some of them have a high IQ level. If they are provided with a good training, proper atmosphere and guidance, they can crack any level of competitive exam,” Kumar said.

According to the data available, there are 161 hearing impaired children in the age group of eight to 16 in Bareilly who have enrolled with the government-run school for specially-abled students.

Principal of the school, Balwant Singh, said they have hostel facility for 75 students. “As many as 35 specially-abled girls are enrolled at our school. They all are day scholars as we don’t have hostel facility for girls. Besides, we have 51 boys who are also day students,” he said.

Singh told TOI that they have a computer lab with 15 computers where the classes would be held.

CDO Kumar said two courses -- computer training and wood craft -- would be started at the school and students can register themselves in either course.

“These children will be given O-level computer training which is desired while applying for various government posts. We have roped in two private organizations to train the students and are also exploring employers so that these children can get a job as soon as they complete the training,” Kumar said. It may be noted that those who are 16 years old can be employed in non–hazardous jobs such as operating computers.

Classes for the first batch will start on Monday, the officer said.

Panaji: Deposits of oily matter mixed with foliage and scattered in patches on Miramar beach had messed up stretches of the shore on Saturday, forcing tourists and walkers to negotiate away from the grease and dirt.

The thin layer of film had spread in linear patches and looked ugly with its dark colour, raising doubts among onlookers whether it was tar balls or coal residue mixed with oil.

The deposits did not seem to be remnants of an oil slick, as it had not spread in large patches but just scattered in small linear stretches with gaps every few metres. Foliage and debris floating in the sea had mixed with the filmy matter.

Goa’s coastline is usually plagued by the surfacing of tar balls from May onwards. Dumping of oil by rogue ships to empty their tanks or leakage from oil rigs has been attributed to the formation tar balls. They are blobs of petroleum formed due to weathering caused by churning of currents on high seas.

Some beaches, especially the long coastline of Salcete from Velsao to Mobor, has been severely affected by tar ball deposition in recent years.

But some experts shown photographs of the oily matter on Miramar beach declined to comment whether these are tar balls or not, expressing that it needs to be examined closely to determine its content.

BJD insiders said from the time the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) was introduced in Parliament, the regional party was very clear about supporting it as “the same has nothing against Indian citizens.” BJD insiders said the party doesn’t want to be part of the Congress-led campaign against CAA. As such people’s response to CAA in Odisha has not been adverse though minority community members have expressed their apprehension about NRC, he said.

Secunderabad: A butterfly zone, an inventory of birds and reptiles, and round-the-clock security are some of the measures envisioned for Kapra lake ’s revival. Residents were informed of the plans by forest officials during the first consultative meeting held on Saturday under the Centre’s initiative to protect wetlands across the country.

District forest officer, Medchal, Ashok Kumar said, “ Multiple agencies including the forest department, GHMC and irrigation department that will have to work together.

At the meeting named ‘Wetland Mitra’, locals’ suggestions were sought over how Kapra can be rejuvenated. Residents suggested that storm-water be allowed to enter the lake through inlets and sewage water entering the lake be treated.

“We look forward to taking an active role in the revival work and in the maintenance of our Kapra lake. The colonies here are vested in the revival of the lake ,"" said Deepa Shailendra, who was at the meeting.

While appreciative of the Centre’s ‘100 days, 100 wetlands’ initiative under which Kapra is listed, locals voiced their concern over pending cases over a major portion of the lake.

“There is no water in the lake. While they are saying a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) will be created to fill the lake with clean water, where is the space and funds for this plant?” asked Raju L Kanchibotla

Mussoorie/Nainital/Dehradun: A thick white blanket of snow covered the state’s popular hill stations — Mussoorie and Nainital — on Saturday much to the joy of tourists who made a beeline for the hill towns to witness the year’s first snowfall in these places.

The snowfall in Mussoorie, which began in the morning, soon covered the entire town, including Mall Road and Landour. It intensified around 3 pm which was followed by a heavy spell for nearly two hours.

With the area near Mall Road receiving six inches of snow, many tourists could be seen enjoying the sight. A delighted Ajay Kohli, a resident of Kanpur, said that he was fortunate to be in Mussoorie. “My entire family is thrilled to witness snowfall for the first time in our lives. It is a mesmerising experience for all of us.” Notably, Landour and Lal Tibba reported about 8 to 10 inches of snow. Dhanaulti was under a white cover as well.

Meanwhile, the snow also caused delay in traffic movement with long queues of vehicles seen stuck on the roads between Picture Palace and Kincraig, and also Gandhi Chowk and Kincraig. Police said that they had to stop some tourist vehicles at Kuthal Gate, outside Dehradun.

Some of the tourists even had to leave their vehicles at Kincraig and go to Mussoorie in other vehicles or even on foot. In Nainital, too, there was a rush of tourists to witness the season’s first snowfall. Many tourists could be seen in Kilbury outside Nainital enjoying the snow-covered terrain and posing for selfies.

A number of places in the higher reaches of Pithoragarh, Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi districts reported snowfall as well.

Even though weather experts have forecast a let-up from cold wave conditions on Sunday, rain and snow along with cold breeze is expected to return on January 6. The weather is likely to clear from January 8 onwards.

“The weather will remain clear on Sunday. However, from January 6 onwards, Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar districts may witness hail and locations above 2,000 to 2,200 metres are expected to receive snow.

LUCKNOW: Groundwork to pitch for coveted Unesco heritage city tag for Ayodhya , the land of Lord Ram, has begun.

Ayodhya district administration has commissioned a survey to build a strong case for temple town.

Vice-chancellor of Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University ( Faizabad ) Prof Manoj Dixit, who is also a member of the high-level team constituted to take the project forward, said: “Ayodhya is a confluence of faith. Ayodhya is as important to Hindus as Vatican is to Christians and Mecca to Muslims. The temple town has all the elements of a heritage city.”

“Ayodhya is the seat of religious leaders associated with Islam, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism which makes it extremely unique,” he added.

The initial proposal was prepared by Faizabad University and Asian Cultural Landscape Association, a body of landscape professionals dedicated to cross-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary study of cultural landscapes in both governmental and non-governmental organizations in 38 Asian countries.

The proposal has also been vetted by experts from BHU.

“Our contention is that the core of Ayodhya is a living heritage. It is a centre of both tangible and non-tangible forms of heritage and deserves to be a heritage city. Ayodhya fulfills seven out of ten parameters laid down by Unesco in its technical criteria for heritage city status,” said Sarvesh Kumar, secretary, ASLA, and a faculty member at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gorakhpur University.

For example, in Unesco’s category of ‘Exhibiting interchange of human values in architecture and monuments’, the report said: “In (Ayodhya) city alone, there are around 2,000 Hindu shrines and temples, 100 Muslim shrines and mosques, five Jain temples symbolizing birth places (including that of first Jain Tirthankar Rishabhadev), five Sikh gurdwaras and Buddhist ancient sites. .”

Officials said field activities would begin as soon as the financial aspect of the exercise is worked out.

Dehradun: Himachal Pradesh CM Jai Ram Thakur on Saturday said that “there is no constitutional mechanism that allows states to refuse the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and deny lakhs of persecuted Hindu families their rights.” Thakur was in Dehradun to inaugurate the BJP’s outreach programme in Uttarakhand to garner support for the CAA which was recently passed by the Parliament.

Addressing the media, Thakur said, “The recent attack on the Nankana Sahib Gurdwara by an angry mob is the latest incident of the persecution of Hindus and Sikhs. But, the Congress believes in divisive politics and would oppose the law which helps Hindus.”

Defending the BJP’s stand on the CAA, Thakur said, “This law gives citizenship, not take away anyone’s citizenship as has been made out by Congress to create confusion. Our CAA campaign is aimed to expose the lie of Congress.” To a query about the reluctance of non-BJP state governments to implement the CAA, Thakur said, “There is no constitutional mechanism that allows the state government to invalidate and refuse the implementation of the CAA. The matter of the citizenship is exclusively the domain of the central government.”

On being asked whether all the states, including Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, are willing to welcome new Hindu migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, Thakur, said, “In my state, there are not many Pakistani Hindu migrants but both Himachal and Uttarakhand would give citizenships by implementing the CAA.”

The state BJP unit in Uttarakhand has planned a two-pronged strategy on the CAA — one deals with awareness while the second one would be to facilitate the targeted migrant Hindu population.

BJP state president Ajay Bhatt who was present along with Thakur, said, “Our party cadre would cover all the 11,000 booths in Uttarakhand to bring awareness about the CAA and expose the Congress. Also, we have set up special groups to help out the migrant Hindus in all districts of the state.”

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will inaugurate 150 new mohalla clinics on Sunday , taking the total number of the neighbourhood primary health care clinics in Delhi to 450.

Officials said the state government’s mission is to ensure that every Delhiite gets free healthcare facilities within a radius of one kilometre of their homes.

“It has been our mission to provide high quality, free healthcare facilities to all residents of Delhi near their homes. We are now close to achieving this goal,” Kejriwal had said in October last year in a function organised near Sangam Vihar flyover in Timarpur to mark the opening of 100 such clinics.

Over the last five years, Kejriwal said, the number of mohalla clinics inaugurated is more than the number of primary health centres opened in the entire country. “Last year, the Australian government invited Satyendar Jain (health minister) to tell them about mohalla clinics, but he was not allowed to travel. Nonetheless, people still talk about our work all over the world,” he added.

PATNA: Police recovered the bullet-ridden body of one Pankaj Kumar (32) from Katarhi village under the Rania Talab police station area in Patna district ’s Paliganj sub-division on Saturday.

According to sources, Pankaj had lodged complaints with mines and geology department against illegal sand mining at his village, Janpara in Bikram block, some months back apart from filing several RTIs regarding the issue.

SHO of Rania Talab police station Indrajeet Singh said preliminary investigations revealed that Pankaj, who had gone to his maternal aunt’s residence on Friday, did not return home. “Residents of Katarhi village informed the police after spotting the body lying in a pool of blood along a road. Pankaj was shot in neck from a close range. An empty cartridge was also recovered from the spot. Pankaj’s body was handed over to his family members after post mortem at Paliganj sub-divisional hospital,” the SHO said, adding Pankaj owned a general store at the village. He said police have so far not received any written complaint from the family members as they were busy cremating the body of the victim.

Paliganj DSP Manoj Kumar Pandey said Pankaj used to post contents on his social media profile regularly against sand-laden trucks passing through his village, much to the inconvenience of common people and schoolchildren. “The spot from where the body was recovered is not the main road of the village. It’s a secluded place. It seems that someone close to Pankaj took him to the spot where the incident occurred.”

PANAJI: The drug treatment clinic (DTC) at the North Goa district hospital at Mapusa , which also offers treatment and rehabilitation for alcohol addicts, sees at least one new case of alcohol addiction every alternate day.While the clinic currently has 400 listed patients undergoing treatment, experts say that the success rate of alcoholics overcoming their addiction was found to be higher among those who received support from family, friends and relatives. Apart from the 60-odd opioid users, the rest are all in for alcoholism.“We see at least one new addiction case every two days,” said Dashmi Mandrekar, a counsellor attached to the clinic who is alarmed about the growing number of people with disorders related to alcohol addiction. “Most are as young as 13 to 14 years when they start drinking. However, they seek medical help only after the ill-effects of excessive drinking start showing on their body and mind.”“Most of those being treated are in their early 30s. Our youngest patient though was a 14-year-old who was brought to the clinic by his parents after they discovered his addiction,” she said. After the initial couple of meetings, they lost contact with him for follow-up sessions. “It’s possible that his parents found it difficult to get him to the clinic,” she said.Depending on the severity of the addiction, a patient is admitted to the 10-bed ward reserved for treatment of alcohol-related cases. “They stay in the hospital for a week where they are watched for withdrawal symptoms and treated accordingly,” she said.Once withdrawal symptoms are treated, the patient is started on an anti-craving medication and deterrents. “The patient needs to visit the clinic once a month where the doctor examines their progress and adjusts the medication dose depending on the improvement seen,” she said.While a few succeed in beating their addiction is a year or two, in many cases, Mandrekar said, treatment continues for a few years, till they do not require to be on medication to stay away from alcohol.Self-motivation, experts say, is very important for success. At times, family members try hard to get the patient to the clinic, but success depends on the co-operation of the patient.The clinic’s medical officer and psychiatrist, Dr Ravindra Patil, said that sometimes, when family members fail to convince the patient to seek treatment, they even go to the extent of requesting clinic staff to forcefully detain the patient, which is not allowed.He narrates an incident where a mother, desperate to save her son from addiction, pleaded with the doctor to keep him tied to the bed to ensure that he doesn’t run away. “We had to tell her that we can’t do that and that her son needed to visit the clinic and stay on his own volition,” Patil said.To ensure better results, when a patient approaches the clinic or is brought in for treatment, a joint meeting is scheduled with the family. Here they are told about the importance of their motivation to help the patient stop consuming alcohol.Meanwhile, she cautions about the chances of addicts relapsing into the drinking habit. This, she said, is higher in the case of patients who are distanced from their families. “With adequate support from family members, some make a complete recovery. There are some who don’t even need to take medication to curb their alcohol cravings,” she said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73104622,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-462127,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-booze-addiction-case-every-2-days-at-mapusa-rehab-clinic/articleshow/73103565.cms

PATNA: Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Saturday said no state can refuse to work on the National Population Register (NPR), adding that the process in the state will begin from May 15. He also ruled out any connection between the NPR and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).SuMo’s assertion comes in the wake of Bengal and Kerala governments halting all work related to the NPR. Taking the names of Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan, the deputy CM said, “No government has the courage to stop NPR exercise in their respective states.”He added: “There is a provision of fine and three years’ imprisonment for government officials who refuse duty related to Census work. Similarly, those who refuse their duty related to NPR, would face disciplinary action along with penalty of Rs 1000.”The deputy CM emphasised that NPR data would help in drawing up schemes to benefit people. “Questions like whether a person has a pucca house or not, or whether he owns a vehicle will help policy makers understand the needs and hence will help in formulation of better policies,” he told mediapersons at the BJP state headquarters here.SuMo said house listing and census will be done in Bihar in the first phase of NPR, which will be completed by May 28.When asked about Union home minister Amit Shah’s statement in Parliament regarding nationwide implementation of NRC, SuMo said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has clarified that NRC will not be implemented across the country and as PM, his statement gains primacy.Accusing the opposition of misleading, SuMo said people were first misled about CAA and now same is being done in the case of NPR. The deputy CM said the decision regarding NPR was originally taken by the UPA government in 2010 and in 2015 the data was updated by linking it with Aadhar. “Now only the NPR is being updated along with the Census,” he added.SuMo assured people, especially those from the minority communities, not to get influenced by the opposition. He said no proof will be required during the exercise related to NPR.The deputy CM also hit out at RJD and Congress for calling a bandh in Bihar against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, saying the state as such had no minority refugees from neighbouring countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan. He added that CAA would help the minorities of those three countries who had been facing atrocities.He cited the example of pelting of stones at Nankana Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan. “CAA is to give protection to such people,” he added.On being asked about the resolution passed by the state assembly, recommending the Centre to conduct a caste-based Census, SuMo said he had made the same request.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73104569,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-737019,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/npr-update-in-bihar-to-begin-on-may-15-sumo/articleshow/73103052.cms

“The patient was suffering from a terminal kidney disease,” dean Dr Shivanand Bandekar said.

GMC has been carrying out live kidney transplants since 2011 with 20 successful transplants done till date, including the Saturday’s surgery.

The tertiary hospital is yet to conduct cadaveric transplants to facilitate which it has recently set up the state organ and tissue transplant organisation (SOTTO) website to allow those in need of transplants to register on waiting lists.

In addition to this, a human leucocyte antigen (HLA) laboratory has also been set up at the GMC.

Stating that such transplants are a great boost to SOTTO, Prabhudesai said, “All 20 patients that underwent transplants at GMC are doing well. We hope to start our deceased donor transplant from this year onwards with the help of SOTTO,” he said.

“Through successful operations such as these, it is our vision to take GMC to great heights. We will conduct doctor trainings on organ transplants wherein our doctors shall travel to Spain. We will also hold annual symposia on organ transplants and orientation,” Rane said.

Ashok Gehlot

JODHPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday said the economy was going down as the central government had no knowledge about it.

“The Central government has no understanding about the economy. Prices have been rising in the country because of the policies of the government,” Gehlot said while addressing the inaugural ceremony of the National Tax Conference-2020 at the auditorium of S N Medical College.

Targeting Union Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman , he said even her husband had said that the state of economy in the country was not good and the government had no understanding of it.

Finance minister’s husband and economist Parakala Prabhakar had expressed concern over economic slowdown in October last year stating that the Narendra Modi government lacked strategic vision to address the challenge.

Gehlot further said the condition of the country is abject today and advised that the government should focus on core issues instead of issues like CAA and NRC.

“While prices of fuel and onions have been increasing in the country, Union home minister Amit Shah came here to generate awareness on CAA,” Gehlot said. He said majority was not always everything in a democracy and the government also needed to keep in mind the voice of the people.

Addressing tax practitioners and experts, he called upon them to work together for bolstering the dropping economy. “The country has been reeling under poor economy. Such phases keep coming and going. The efforts of improvement in GDP are imperative in such a situation and tax persons have a key role in it,” said Gehlot.

The chief minister also exhorted them to provide suggestions to the government so that they could be added in the next budget proposals.

The project involves a total of 23 structures, including bridges, flyovers and underpasses

HARIDWAR: The balance work of Muzaffarnagar- Haridwar section of NH-58, which connects the national capital with Uttarakhand , is expected to be completed by November 30, a month before the project’s December 2020 deadline, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials said on Saturday. “Efforts are being made to complete the work by July-August. In any case, it will not be later than November 30,” said a senior NHAI official, who did not want to be named.

According to official sources, the NH-58 project, which started about a decade ago, involves total 23 structures, including bridges, flyovers and underpasses on the stretch from College of Engineering, Roorkee (COER) to Shantikunj, Haridwar. Of these, flyovers at Patanjali Yogpeeth and Singh Dwar near Gurukul Kangri University are almost complete. Construction of new flyovers is underway at Dudhadhari Chowk and Chandi Ghat. Work is yet to start on flyovers near Ranipur Roh and Premnagar Chowk.

Of the nine major bridges to be built on the highway, four are near Har-ki-Pauri. One will be parallel to the bridge opposite central control room (CCR), the second will run parallel to the cable bridge, the third will be on the new supply channel opposite the giant Shiva statue, while the fourth one will be near Sarvanad Ghat on old supply channel. Two major bridges at Bhimgoda and Dam Escape are under construction. Work on three major bridges at Ratamau, Ranipur Roh and Pathri is almost complete. The project also involves construction of underpasses at Sarai road, Sitapur in Jwalapur, Shantikunj and an area near Pawan Dham. One underpass near Patanjali Yogpeeth, two on Bahadarabad Bypass, one near Gurukul Kangri University, one opposite Kabir Ashram, near Singh Dwar are nearly complete.

Notably, work on widening the highway had initially been assigned to a company called Era Infrastructure. After the company caused inordinate delay, its contract was cancelled last year and a new contract was forged with Sam India Built Well. The new company started work in November 25 last year. According to the NHAI official, the project’s progress is being closely monitored by the central as well as state government. “The state administration is extending full support. Bills generated on monthly bases are paid promptly by the administration,” he said.

201,['5/01/2020'],Vehicles made before April 2019 can also be fitted with high security registration plates,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Bareilly: Not just new vehicles, but even owners of old vehicles can get high security registration plate (HSRP) fitted on their vehicles, said the transport authority in a circular issued to Regional Transport Offices (RTOs). Everyone can get the advanced number plates installed on their vehicles by contacting their automobile dealers, said the circular.

Earlier, the ministry of road transport and highways (North) had made it mandatory for the vehicles manufactured on or after April 1, 2019 to be fitted with the tamper-proof HSRP.

Although HSRP is not mandatory for the vehicles manufactured before April 2019, RTOs have been directed to sensitise people about its benefits.

Confirming the receipt of the circular, senior assistant regional transport officer (ARTO), Bareilly, RP Singh told TOI, “The transport authority directed that all vehicles, including those manufactured before April 2019, could be fitted with HSRPs. Although HSRP is in not mandatory for the older vehicles, we advise vehicle owners to get it affixed, because it helps track lost or stolen vehicles. Thus, it helps curb vehicle thefts. The ministry had in 2018 directed that all vehicles should be fitted with HSRP. Meanwhile, in April 2019, a fresh direction was issued, asking RTOs to ensure compliance of the previous directions.”

According to information from RTO, HSRPs have a chromium hologram fixed on it using hot stamping method. Besides, a third registration mark, also a chromium hologram sticker, is affixed on vehicles’ windshields from inside. It has vehicles’ registration details and engine and chassis numbers, which makes the vehicle more secure from theft.

ARTO added, “As HSRPs are tamper-free, it helps track the lost or stolen vehicles. The HSRP and the third registration hologram are non-renewable and cannot be reused, because once taken out, the holograms are destroyed.”

According to officials, automobile sellers have tied up with manufacturing companies, and thus, one just needs to contact their respective dealers for the purchase and fitting of HSRP.

Besides, the registration certificate (RC) will not be issued if new vehicle owners fail to get HSRP fitted.

202,['5/01/2020'],BCG report adds fuel to an already-burning Amaravati,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Vijayawada: With the Boston Consultancy Group (BCG) report proposing decentralised growth, the capital region continued to be on the boil for the 18th day on Saturday. Alleged police raids at houses of farmers created flutter in Velagapudi. Locals have alleged that police raided their houses at 3 am on Saturday and took away a farmer from the village to an undisclosed location and his whereabouts are still unknown.

Meanwhile, the police action against women on Friday led to a domino effect. Farmers resorted to a new form of protest on the day — they cleaned the shoes of police personnel and requested them to support them as they are protesting in a peaceful manner. They hit the streets from early morning, protesting against the BCG report. All shops and commercial establishments remained shut across the capital region following a bandh called by them.

Mandadam village has emerged as the epicentre of the protests with farmers taking out rallies and observing dharnas. Condemning police action against women, locals have decided to not cooperate with the police. They have decided not to provide drinking water to the police force deployed in the area. They asked them to remove their vehicles parked in front of their houses and shops and stopped police vehicles from entering their village.

A large number of farmers from Mandadam staged a sit-in at the Seed Access Road bringing traffic to a standstill for hours before cops moved them. Farmers from Tadikonda mandal also organised road blockades condemning police action. Women, meanwhile, at Thulluru village also held a huge rally to protest the police action against women.

Student unions also joined the protests of farmers on Saturday. They conducted rallies and dharnas across Krishna and Guntur districts. A protest programme by Students Federation of India (SFI) turned violent with police caning them at Dharna Chowk in Vijayawada. Students from various organisations held a rally at Tenali raising slogans against the three-capital proposal.

The Lorry Owners’ Association of Krishna district have extended its support to the agitating farmers. They, too, held a dharna at Dharna Chowk on Saturday.

Spokespersons for Amaravati Parirakshna Samiti said the BCG report is also on the lines of G N Rao committee. It appears that the decision to shift the capital was taken prior to the setting up of the committees and that they were later set up only to legitimise the decision, they said. They said the protests will be further intensified till the state government rolls back its decision.

Representative image

PANAJI: Three years after GST was implemented across the country, a detailed chapter on the subject will be introduced as part of the Class XI accountancy syllabus for commerce stream students across Goa.

The Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (GBSHSE) has asked all affiliated institutes offering the commerce stream to introduce the new module from the academic year 2020-21, chairman Ramkrishna Samant said.

The move aims to help commerce students comprehend the newly-introduced tax reform, he said.

“GST is a landmark reform which has made affected the taxation system of India. It is an indirect tax levied on the supply of Goods and Services. GST replaced multiple taxes levied by state governments and the central government. It has brought us to ‘one nation one tax regime’,” states the module framed for higher secondary schools to implement.

Higher secondary schools have been informed of the decision through a circular issued on January 3.

The board has told institutes that due to the new module on GST, students will understand the meaning of GST, they will know the various indirect taxes merged under GST, students will understand the objectives and advantages of GST, besides learning the various slabs under GST structure. Students will also learn the accounting procedure for GST, the board has said.

The module to be implemented in schools states that the benefit of GST is that under it all taxes (excise, VAT, CST and service tax, etc) are subsumed into one. There will only be three accounts, SGST, CGST, and IGST. The tax administration between the state and Centre is easy to manage and ensures smooth functioning of business, the GST chapter reads

“GST taxes will be paid only at the point of consumption so there is transparency,” the module says. “Tax system becomes regular and certain. It removes the cascading effect, ie, no tax on tax even if goods move across state borders. Under GST, the tax is calculated on the value added at each stage of transfer of ownership. This helps in reducing the cost of goods to the consumers.”

LUCKNOW: The phone of Ved Darapuri , 51, did not stop ringing ever since the news broke on Saturday that his father SR Darapuri, has been granted bail after 15 days.

The 76-year-old ex-IPS officer was arrested from his residence on charges of rioting and criminal conspiracy on December 20, a day after the city witnessed violent protests against new citizenship law. SR Darapuri was recently diagnosed with cancer. At his Indiranagar residence, Ved and his family could not hide their joy and relief when they received written bail order on Saturday evening.

Ved said his family could not wait for Monday when his father would be back home after staying in jail for 16 days. “Kids thought he will be back today itself but written bail orders came in the evening. We have waited for him for over two weeks, so Monday is not that far,” he said. Sharing the news on social media, S R Darapuri’s grandson Siddharth, wrote: “Keep decorating your castle of straw, gale of truth, sincerity and justice will blow it away.”

“I went to meet him in jail a week back. Rather than complaining about the behaviour of police or government, he asked how the city was doing and if children were fine,” Ved said.

In the review meeting of Atal Ayushman Yojana, Dilip Kotia , chairman of the scheme, informed that the health department has made 35.85 lakh golden cards under the scheme till January 4, 2020.

“We had set up various camps, which started functioning from November 25, to make golden cards for the scheme. The camps were opened across all districts of the state. Initially, these camps were to function till December 25, 2019, but now they will run till January 25, 2020,” Kotia told TOI.

206,['5/01/2020'],"Youth recaim, revamp, rewrite climate dialogue","This story is from January 5, 2020

Name: Abhinaya Polaka

Age: 17 years

Supported by her photographer father, this class 11 student of Indus International Hyderabad took her first green steps in 2017. Armed with 63 saplings, she went around her community in Poddatur (Kadapa), and planted them hoping to see more trees in her colony, few years later. Today, Abhinaya has an NGO -- Guarding the Rights of Environment, Animals and People -- and is also in talks with government officials in Telangana to become a part of their afforestation programme. Last month, she, along with 10 other friends from school, cleaned out two tractors full of garbage from the famous Mypadu beach in Nellore. Her motto: Thing Big. Do Big. “We are at a very critical stage where taking small measures isn’t enough. Also, working in isolation will not help. The government and civil society have to come together to jointly fight climate change ,” said Abhinaya who believes that more youngsters must come forward to take charge of their future. “Unless we do something today to preserve what is left, we have to face the consequences tomorrow,” she added.

Abhinaya’s top 3 recommendations

- Take small steps towards zero waste management; make compost from kitchen waste

- Make it a habit to carry a cloth or paper bag while going to a supermarket/mall

- Don’t be afraid; we are never too young to do a good deed

Name: Asawari Bhagwat

Age: 16 years

Just around the time the world started taking note of Swedish climate activist and now youth icon, Greta Thunberg, city girl Asawari too got hooked onto the subject. Startled by news articles doing the rounds on social media, about the deteriorating standards of environment the world over, she vowed to do whatever she could to contribute to its preservation. “I decided to begin at school by recycling and reusing waste,” the class 11 student of Aga Khan Academy said. “As a first step we cleaned out our cupboards and segregated the paper that can be reused, from what was waste…The latter was handed over to government schools,” she added. Another important initiative she spearheaded was at the school canteen: reducing wastage of food. Together with other classmates, she ensured students took small portions at one time and didn’t have leftovers on their plate. An active member of the Fridays For Future (FFF) network – global climate strike by youth – she has also started segregation of waste at home and composting for her kitchen garden.

Asawari’s top 3 recommendations

- Keep tabs on the paper being used; if there is an alternative, don’t use

- Groundwater levels are very low; stop taking showers and use buckets

- Use public transport as and when possible; it’ll help curb air pollution

Name: Fariha Syed

Age: 15 years

Until two years ago, Fariha was just another teenager little aware of what was going on in the world outside. It was only when she joined Phoenix – a social group comprising young green activists – that she realised the seriousness of the conversations around climate change and how it could ruin the future of those like her. “I learned a lot and understood that it directly impacts us and unless we do something about it, we’ll have to suffer in the long run,” said the student of Villa Marie citing the Delhi smog as the perfect example of how the lives of people in big cities are at risk, thanks to environmental degradation. “Now, I have taken it upon myself to spread as much awareness as I can on this issue so that people can make more informed decisions,” Fariha said. Apart from touring educational institutions in the city to involve more youth in this fight against climate change, the teenager has also started making small yet effective changes within her college. One of them is – encouraging students to carry their own paper straws to the canteen. Recently, she also joined the fight against tree felling in Nallagandla, together with locals and other school students. “It is important that despite our academic schedules we youngsters make time for this…this is the purpose of our education, to make us responsible citizens,” she said.

Fariha’s top 3 three recommendations

- Keep a paper/jute bag handy; use it to carry groceries, vegetables

- Stop littering public spaces, use designated garbage bins to dispose waste

- Replace plastic straws with steel or paper straws; it’s a small step in the right direction

Name: Usama Hazari

Age: 21

Hugely inspired by Bhagat Singh and Che Guevara – both revolutionaries and eminent crusaders of social causes – Usama is among the frontrunners of Hyderabad’s youth movement against climate change. From organising awareness camps and discussions around the subject, to hitting the streets every time the authorities decide to put development before environment, he has been actively involved with it all. His strongest weapon: arts. “Instead of lecturing people, particularly the youth, I have realised that it is more effective if something is explained through a medium of performing arts. So, along with my team that comprises theatre artists, dancers, musicians etc, we do workshops in colleges where the issue is put forth through a narrative that students understand,” said Usama while admitting that the movement needs more young people to come out and get their hands dirty. “I had heard this speech by Hugh Jackman where he said that it takes only one generation to be great to change the world…we can be that generation, as we have that potential,” the student of St Marys College, another active member of FFF, said.

Usama’s three recommendations

- Spread more awareness among people around you

- Plant more trees; reject plastic

- Vote maturely; choose people who consider environmental issues

Name: Priyanka Kota

Age: 26 years

From the Nallamala forest closer home, to the hills of Uttarakhand, Priyanka has left her ‘green’ footprint everywhere. Born into a family of farming enthusiasts and brought up by grandparents in a village home surrounded by greenery, she has always been drawn to issues related to the environment. Hence, she didn’t think twice before joining a team of volunteers who went ‘plogging’ along the Tank Bund to remove plastic waste from the area or travel to Zaheerabad to participate in a biodiversity meet to learn about organic farming or even spearhead a campaign on seed ball plantation. Having spent a few years as an active campaigner of this cause, she feels that youth activists need to be more persistent. “Not everybody paid attention to Greta Thunberg on the first day. But she continued her mission, she was consistent. That’s what we need. People coming out to protest only when there is deforestation happening is not the solution,” said the MBA graduate urging people to be more conscious of the “climate emergency” facing them.

Priyanka’s top 3 recommendations

- Stop using showers; use buckets to conserve water

- Use local food rather than packaged food

- Organic waste can be very useful; segregate at source so that it doesn’t become toxic

Roorkee: Pravin Togadia , international president of Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad (AHP), who is on a tour of Roorkee and Dehradun, took a swipe at the BJP-led government in the Centre for its “lack of good governance”.

Togadia said on Saturday, “It is good that Ram temple is being constructed in the country [at Ayodhya in UP], but Ram Rajya is not yet visible in the country. Farmers are not debt free, youths do not have jobs, housewives are scared due to uncontrollable inflation, no security for women. When there are so many problems, then where is our Ram Rajya?”

The leader was addressing a group of his party workers at the residence of Umesh Pradhan, district general secretary of AHP, in Roorkee. On the issues of CAA and NRC, he said, “What is the harm in this move by Centre? But, I want to tell the government that displaced Hindus should also be settled down in Kashmir on priority.”

Togadia also announced a statewide agitation against the state government for setting up a Char Dham shrine board which he said was an attempt to “take over Char Dham and other temples in Uttarakhand”. “Can the state government dare to take over administration of mosques and churches?” he said.

BAREILLY: An alert salesman saved his colleague’s life at Shri Sai Filling Station petrol pump on Kanth road in Moradabad on Saturday, after a local resident Danish poured petrol, which he had brought with him in a bottle, on another salesman, Ramratan.

Police said Ramratan had earlier turned Danish away when he had approached the petrol pump, seeking to buy petrol in a bottle. Enraged by the refusal, Danish managed to get the bottle filled at the next fuel station, and returned to teach Ramratan “a lesson”. The accused has been arrested and sent to jail.

The petrol pump manager D P Singh said Ramratan and Shamshad were on duty when Danish arrived with an empty bottle and asked Ramratan to fill it. “When Ramratan refused to sell petrol in a bottle, he threatened to set the petrol pump on fire and left in a huff, only to return within 15 minutes, this time, carrying a bottle full of petrol, which he poured on Ramratan.”

Seeing this, Shamshad, who was standing nearby, confronted Danish. In order to save Ramratan, he also poured petrol on Danish’s clothes, just as the latter had allegedly taken out a cigarette lighter from his pocket. On hearing Shamshad’s screams, other employees rushed to rescue both salesmen and catch the accused.

Inspector Naval Marvah, SHO of Civil Lines police station, said they have arrested Danish and sent him to jail, after lodging an FIR under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC against him.

If it was ‘helplessness’ that prevented Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva from rushing to the rescue of a humiliated Draupadi at the royal assembly, what is it that keeps them from hugging and consoling her at the war camp when her sleeping sons have been so mercilessly killed? After all, aren’t they their sons too? Earlier, when his son Abhimanyu was killed, had not Arjuna wept inconsolably, taking his wife Subhadra in his arms? When Ghatotkacha was done to death, had not Bhima brought his mighty son’s body from the battlefield on his shoulders, washing the blood with copious tears? But now? Why this indifference? Well, the fact is that the Pandava brothers are not sure who of them have sired which of those Upa Pandavas. Who knows whose father is who? Does even Draupadi know? So whom should they grieve for?

“Let go of that wretched Ashwatthama,” a disgusted Draupadi tells Krishna as she notices the apathy and mean-mindedness of her husbands. “Release him from captivity. Let him go. Today, not only has he brought me immense sorrow by beheading my sons but also shown me the darkest truth of my life.”

The stunning acuity and brutal practicality with which Bhyrappa unravels the minds and souls of the characters of Mahabharata make Parva stand out among the other versions of the ancient Sanskrit epic. Written in 1979, Parva is a watershed in reconstructing Mahabharata. It continues to be widely read and debated even after forty years of its publication. The 619-page book in Kannada is a literary gem, an epic in itself, as the author retains the characters and original framework of Vyasa’s Mahabharata but narrates the story in the most believable way.

Non-mythological approach

The author’s extensive study of the historicity of Mahabharata and social and anthropological aspects of the time have given incredible authenticity to the narrative in Parva. The novel is unique in a number of respects. It offers logical explanations to glorified exaggerations in Mahabharata, completely divesting the epic of its mythical, divine, superhuman and magical powers. Krishna here is no incarnation of god but a friendly, wonderful human being, a statesman with foresight, who intelligently counsels the Pandavas through difficult times. In Duryodhana’s court, Draupadi saves her modesty with her own courage. Devas, rakshasas and gandharvas are different tribal communities. Gandhari has only 14 children, not 100; the rest of them are born to Dhritarashtra through maidservants. The great teacher Drona is basically an insecure man, more concerned about securing a position for his son in the Kuru kingdom. ‘Dharmaraja’ Yudhistira often uses dharma as a shield for his inaction. Karna is bestowed upon a 15-year-old Kunti not by the solar deity Surya, but by the handsome sage Durvasa, whom she happens to ask out of curiosity ‘How are children born?’ Later, after her marriage, when Kunti to her dismay learns that her husband Pandu is impotent, she wistfully remembers Durvasa. Her co-wife Madri is fascinated by the Deva tribe in the Himalayas, who share husbands and wives. “Look at those women,” she tells Kunti in awe. “All of them roam around with babies on their backs! Not childless like you and me.”

“Sex and death are the most recurring themes in Bhyrappa’s novels. They reach their zenith in Parva. While the first is the basic instinctive drive that can turn humans into beasts, the second is the ultimate truth of life,” notes writer Uma Rao in her recent book ‘Parva – Aayama Mattu Ananyate (Dimensions and Uniqueness).’On this spectrum unfolds an intricately woven human drama of love and hatred, virtues and vices, noble thoughts and bloodshed. Kunti and Draupadi are the towering female personalities in Parva, with all their strengths, weaknesses, frustrations and ambitions. They are also the victims of circumstances, worst-hit by the evasive nature of dharma and changing definition of morality. With no holds barred, the author lays bare the sensuality of these female characters, thereby questioning the hypocrisy of the patriarchal society.

When all medications fail, Pandu, worried over the possibility of losing the throne to his brother Dhritarashtra’s heirs, invites five leaders from the Deva tribe to impregnate his wives, through ‘niyoga,’ a practice considered to be permissible to perpetuate the lineage. After Pandu and Madri’s death in the Himalayas, Kunti returns to the kingdom with the five kids in tow. When they all grow up, Duryodhana throws a basic question on which the war is to be fought: How can Pandavas, born to outsiders, be considered part of the Kuru lineage? This sows the seeds of doubt even in the mind of grandsire Bhishma about the legitimacy of niyoga.

War and devastation

How is it that the clash between two families for the throne of Hastinapura assumes the proportion of such a major war, encompassing kingdoms of the entire Aryavartha? The reason, as Draupadi puts it, is the weakness of the Aryan men for ‘gambling, alcohol, women and war.’ Besides being a great psychological epic and a social commentary of the bygone age, Parva is also an excellent treatise on politics and war. The novel opens with preparations for the war and progresses through a series of personal reflections of the principal personalities. In terms of storytelling, Bhyrappa broke a new ground in Kannada literature by effectively using the ‘stream-ofconsciousness’ technique of writing where the thought processes of the characters are often addressed to oneself rather than to readers, in fragments of sentences. One of the small drawbacks of the novel is repetitiveness at places. But this very style of saying things again and again also serves to help readers vividly picturize the sights and sounds of the settings, especially the battlefield of Kurukshetra .

After the bloodshed haunts the dark emptiness. The soon-to-be king Yudhisthira gets into a state when hundreds of women raped by soldiers come to him, asking him who will take care of their illegitimate children. A metalsmith goes about collecting broken metal arrows lying all over the battlefield to prepare ploughs and artefacts. The Pandavas have won the kingdom but lost their heirs. Abhimanyu’s pregnant wife Uttara, the last hope of the dynasty, delivers, but it is a stillbirth. At the same time, the wife of the metalsmith gives birth to a child, live and kicking, symbolizing the propensity of life to spring amid gloom, and foretelling the imminent fall of dynasties and rise of commoners in the time to come.

Vijayawada: As a precautionary measure to contain cockfights, Krishna district police have slapped bind over cases against 200 habitual cockfight organisers in the last few days. Apart from that, officials have set up inter-departmental teams with local revenue officers to crackdown on the organisers.

Speaking to STOI, Krishna district SP M Ravindranath Babu said they have not issued any permission for any cockfights so far. “We have been keeping an eye on cockfight organisers and bladesmiths who sell knives used in cockfight. We held a meet with the district collector and other stakeholders on December 27 and have began to take precautionary measures in a coordinated manner,” the district SP told STOI.

Last year, Krishna district police witnessed a 43% spike in the number of cases booked against illegal cockfight organisers. Elaborating on that, police personnel explained that they registered 914 cases in which 1,561 persons were arrested and Rs 8.32 lakh in cash recovered. Prior to that in 2018 in both Vijayawada and Krishna districts the number of cases against organisers rose up to 250% with 1,045 cases being registered.

Sources said that police are like to give permission for certain cockfights, which do not involve gambling or knives, keeping the cultural significance of Sankranti in mind.

Meanwhile, regardless of the precautionary measures, organisers continue to raise their fighter roosters, which are supposedly worth several lakhs. The common areas where cockfights take place in the district include Nuzvid, Gudivada, Kankipadu, Avanigadda and Machilipatnam.

Sources in the police admitted that several events will be organised, albeit low-key, on the border areas with Telangana like Nandigama and Jaggaiahpet with local political support.

PANAJI: Construction of the compound wall by the Goa public works department (PWD) is nearing completion at the land allotted at Cuncolim to set up a permanent campus of the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Goa. Work on the construction of buildings in the campus, allotted to the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) of government of India, will begin towards the end of January 2020. To mark the beginning of this work, NIT Goa will plant 1,000 trees of the indigenous mancurad mango variety this month, NIT Goa director Gopal Mugeraya told TOI.“There was a slight delay in starting work on the new campus due to a technical problem in the tender documentation. The work has now been allotted to CPWD and Rs 30 crore towards this work has already been transferred. Work will begin by January-end and phase one of the new campus will be ready by July 2021. We are planting 1,000 mancurad mango trees when the construction work begins, so that by the time we move to the first phase of the campus, the trees take good shape,” Mugeraya said.He said that the campus has also been designed to be a solar-powered one and will make use of water harvesting so that there is minimal burden on local natural resources.“The design of the new buildings is ready. Besides planting 1,000 trees of the indigenous variety, I am also seeing to it that not a single existing tree on the land is cut. We want to create a green campus,” Mugeraya told TOI.He said that there was an illegal structure in the campus land, which has also been demolished recently, clearing way for construction of the new buildings.NIT Goa became operational in 2010 and has sence been functioning from its temporary campus at Goa Engineering College at Farmagudi.After much delay, over 120 acres of prime land was finally handed over to NIT Goa in Cuncolim for construction of its permanent campus in mid-2017. The NIT was originally expected to shift to its permanent campus from the academic year 2020-21, but this target stands delayed by a year.The first phase of the project is estimated to cost around Rs 500 crore and is being funded by the central government.Mugeraya has maintained from the early stages of designing the new campus that he wants the permanent campus of NIT Goa to be an eco-friendly one.

Lucknow University

LUCKNOW: Lucknow University , which came into existence through crowdfunding , will again resort to it to not let its financial constraints hamper its centenary celebrations.

LU will soon be making a call to its former students and the general public to raise funds so that this historical institution can celebrate its legacy.

“We will be soon doing a centenary collection from our former students. We will also appeal general public to pay tribute to the institution which has contributed in disseminating knowledge for 10 decades,” said LU spokesperson Sanjay Medhavi. He said even a small contribution from the former students, who have excelled in various fields, be it sports, bureaucracy, music, medical and other to come ahead and help their alma mater.

LU began its journey as a small school in Canning high school in 1864. It was after 57 years that this school, located in palace Amin-ud-Daulah, Aminabad transformed into a university.

This was possible with the help of donations like land, personal bonds and money pooling by the general public and taluqdars.

Not only this, war bonds, which are debt securities issued by a government to finance military operations and other expenditure in times of war, were also given for the establishment.

The university administration is hoping for similar support from common people and its former students to help student fight its financial constraints.

Kolam or alpana being drawn on the roads during Saturday’s rally

KOLKATA: As the mass agitation against the new citizenship act spread across the country, kolam and Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s, ‘Hum Dekhenge’, held a group of protesters together in Kolkata on Saturday. The participants in an anti-CAA rally from Gariahat to Garia drew kolam or alpana on roads as others recited Faiz’s poem, which recently raked up a controversy after students at IIT-Kanpur recited it during a protest following which, the institute set up a panel to consider whether the writing by the famous Urdu poet was anti-Hindu or not.

“Sab taaj uchhale jayenge/sab takht giraye jayenge/bas nam rahega Allah ka/hum dekhenge”: the lines rented the air as the rally started off from Gariahat in the afternoon. “The poem got dragged into a controversy recently after students at IIT Kanpur recited it during a protest on the campus a few weeks ago. We decided to chant the lines to show our solidarity with the students who protested against CAA,” said Tanmoy Ghosh of Bangla Sanskriti Manch. “The youth does not want a division on communal lines. They uphold secular values that the country has cherished for long. The need to raise a voice against divisive politics has been drawing youths to these rallies in large numbers across the country,” said Azhar Salim, a participant.

As the rallyists started walking, a group stopped and drew large kolam motifs with a strong anti-CAA message on the road near the Jadavpur University campus. Kolam, a form of art similar to alpana in Bengal, turned into a popular tool in anti-CAA protests in Chennai and protesters here seem to have taken a leaf out of their book. “Alpana is part of Bengal’s culture and every Bengali relates with it instantly. We decided to use it as a mark of protest this time,” said Pradip Goswami, a participant. As the procession proceeded towards Garia, several such kolams were drawn on the 10-km stretch.

Ichche Banerjee, a member of Mangal Shobhyatra—a cultural platform that was one of the outfits to organise the rally—pointed out a brush was the most powerful tool for painters and they wanted to use it when they registered their protest against the new citizenship law. “We do not want violent protests. But we need a powerful tool to express our emotions. It is unfortunate that we have to prove our citizenship after so many decades,” she said.

As the participants, some draped in tricolour and some carrying anti-CAA/NRC posters, marched on, people kept joining the rally from different points. “The new citizenship law affects each one of us. I have never participated in such rallies, but I decided to take to the street this time,” said Farhin Shayan, a member.

Kolkata: Cryobiologist Sunit Mukherjee , who assisted Subhas Mukhopadhyay in using in-vitro-fertilization ( IVF ) technique to create India’s first and the world’s second test tube baby, Durga, on October 3, 1978, died on Saturday. He was 89.

“He was born on March 1, 1931. He died around 3.30am on Saturday,” a relative, Animesh Chakraborty, told TOI. Instrumental in having Mukhopadhyay’s name included in the Dictionary of Medical Biography, Sunit ran Subhas Mukherjee Memorial Reproductive Biology Research Centre inside Behala Industrial Estate almost single-handedly. He had a degree in applied nutrition from Grad School of Nutrition, Cornell University, USA and headed JU’s food technology department. He and Mukhopadhyay did extensive research on the role of food intake in prevention of infertility.

All his life, Sunit fought for his mentor’s recognition, from the time he had approached IVF specialist T C Anand Kumar, who, till then, was known as the “creator of India’s first test-tube baby”. Sunit made Kumar go through Mukhopadhyay’s handwritten notes and made him and the world accept that the title belonged to Mukhopadhyay.

On June 19, 1981, Mukhopadhyay committed suicide. It was thanks to Sunit’s pursuit that in 1997, Bengal recognized Mukhopadhyay’s feat posthumously. Sunit told the world that by the time Kumar’s “Harsha” was born in Mumbai on 6 August 1986, Subhas’s “Durga” or “Kanupriya Agarwal” was already eight years old, born 67 days after Robert G Edwards had the world’s first test-tube baby delivered in England. “Subhas’ method of assisted reproduction is the most preferred, worldwide. His use of human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) in multiple ovulation has the most success rate. He transferred the embryo after cryo-freezing and preservation to the next menstrual cycle,” Sunit had told TOI in an interview in 2018.

Vijayawda: TDP supremo and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu has ridiculed the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) recommendations on the capital and called it’s report a “waste paper with a bunch of lies”.

Speaking to media persons at the NTR Bhavan on Saturday, Naidu said the BCG has lost credibility by submitting a fake report, which was written by the ruling YSRC. He alleged that YSRC MP Vijayasai Reddy’s son-in-law, Rohit Reddy, is closely associated with BCG.

The BCG has failed to take into account the developments by the TDP and the space available to house the secretariat, assembly and the high court, said. He criticised the BCG for ignoring the fact that Visakhapatnam was rebuilt by the TDP government after it was devastated by the Hudhud cyclone. “They have failed to mention the available space in Amaravati for government and the development of Visakhapatnam. Thus, the report is a bunch of lies and was drafted by the Jaganmohan Reddy government,” Naidu said.

“A consultancy does what it is asked and it is paid for that work. The BCG, too, has done what the YSRC wanted and it was paid a fee,” Naidu alleged. He dismissed the BCG and the G N Rao committee recommendations and termed them as attempts by the Jaganmohan Reddy government to shift the capital from Amaravati. He said the government was dishonoring the commitment made to the farmers for their lands in Amaravati and a government has the responsibility to fulfill the promises of the previous government.

Coming out strongly in support of continuing with the earlier plan of making Amaravati the capital of AP, the former chief minister said that Amaravati was decided as the capital based on the recommendations of the Sivaramakrishnan Committee. He recalled that Jaganmohan Reddy and the YSRC had accepted Amaravati as the capital, when it was proposed. Moreover, he dismissed the government’s claim that Rs 1.1 lakh crore will be required to build the capital in Amaravati. He said that Amaravati is a self-finance city and the available land are assets for the government to build the capital and develop the state and accused the YSRC leaders of spreading lies about the capital.

Representative image

PUNE: The Daund revenue officials on Friday set ablaze 23 fibre boats used by the sand mafia for illegal dredging along the Bhima river.

“We have destroyed 15 big-sized boats and eight small ones, collectively worth over Rs1 crore. Besides, we have seized 10 suction pumps meant to dredge sand from the riverbeds,” Daund tehsildar Sanjay Patil said on Saturday.

He said they were in the process of identifying the operators of these boats. “I have asked circle officers of the areas in question to identity the boats’ operators and submit a report. Based on their findings, we will plan our course of action,” Patil said.

The river passes through the Daund tehsil before flowing into the Ujani reservoir in Solapur’s Madha taluka. The villages of Vaklunj and Malthan lie along the riverbank.

The action followed several complaints lodged by the residents of these villages with the revenue department over the past few weeks. The villagers had complained that sustained illegal sand-mining caused a sharp deterioration in the quality of their roads.

“Hundreds of trucks illegally carrying sand ply on these roads. The roads are not designed to sustain heavy vehicular traffic. The subsequent deterioration of the roads and the riverbeds prompted the villagers to submit complaints to the revenue department,” a revenue official said.

Meanwhile, the villagers said the authorities need to take stricter action to curb illegal sand-mining in their areas. “Over the past decade, Daund has emerged as the hub of the sand mafia, with the demand for said rising consistently in the real estate market. Besides, the quartz of the Bhima basin is considered to be of a superior quality, boosting its demand in Pune’s construction industry,” another revenue official said.

Social activist Balasaheb Chaudhary, who has been pursuing the matter of illegal sand-mining with the authorities concerned, said the district administration needs to carry out this kind of drive on a regular basis. “These operators are financially influential. They purchase new boats within a week and resume their activity. The authorities must take sustained action,” he said.

221,['5/01/2020'],All eyes on SC judgment on rights of minority institutes,"This story is from January 5, 2020

File photo

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday will pass an important verdict on whether the right of minority institutions including madrasas to appoint teachers could be taken away by the government by adopting a legislative procedure that aims to uplift the status of the community.

A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and U U Lalit will deliver its verdict on the issue while deciding constitutional validity of West Bengal Madrasah Service Commission Act, 2008, under which the appointment of teachers in madrasas was to be decided by a commission.

As per the Act, a Commission was constituted and section 8 of it says that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any contract, custom or usage to the contrary, it shall be the duty of the Commission to select and recommend persons to be appointed to the vacant posts of teachers. The case and the ruling can help settle an ambiguity in the law as while governments that fund or aid minority institutions can recommend guidelines for appointments, but till now, they have not been able to make the placements themselves.

The managing committee of various madrasas moved the Calcutta high court which declared the Act unconstitutional saying it is violative of Article 30 which says all minorities shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.

The HC verdict was thereafter challenged in SC by teachers who were appointed under the new law. Agreeing to hear their plea, the apex court granted them interim relief and directed the state government not to remove them from their jobs till final order and release them salary. As no appointment was done during the legal dispute resulting in more than 2,600 vacancies, the apex court in May 2018 allowed filling up of the posts.

222,['5/01/2020'],Two winners: HC grants injunction on swearing in panchayat president,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Madurai: Observing that it was prima facie convinced about a breach of rules regarding counting of votes, Madras high court on Saturday granted interim injunction on swearing in a woman candidate as panchayat president of Sankarapuram village in Sivaganga district after two women were declared winners to the post.

In her petition, M Devi stated that only two candidates including herself and A Priyadharshini had contested for the post. She said Priyadharshini is closely associated with the ruling AIADMK. According to her, of the 22,599 eligible voters in the village only 11,906 had voted in the second phase of polling on December 30. Devi said that the election officer/ block development officer of Sakkottai panchayat union had declared her winner after the counting of votes on January 2 around 8 pm. Devi said she had secured 5,871 votes and won with a margin of 62 votes while Priyadharshini had secured 5,809 votes. Officials handed over the certificate declaring her election to the post of panchayat president of Sankarapuram village. Since Priyadharshini created a commotion, the result was reaffirmed by the officials.

However, she was later shocked to know that the election officer had also issued a certificate to Priyadharshni declaring her as winner around 5 am on January 3. She alleged that it was under pressure from highly influential ruling party leaders and higher officials that the election officer illegally issued the certificate declaring Priyadharshini as winner. The petitioner thus moved the HC Madurai bench seeking to declare the second certificate null and void and unconstitutional under Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act and Tamil Nadu Panchayats (Election) Rules. She also sought interim injunction to forbear the authorities concerned from swearing in Priyadharshini as the panchayat president.

When the petition was taken up for hearing at a special sitting on Saturday, a division bench of Justice R Subramanian and B Pugalendhi observed certificate (Form 25) was issued to the petitioner on January 2 at 8 pm and now it has been stated that the certificate was issued wrongly. They said that it is now claimed that counting of certain votes were omitted before issuing Form 25 declaring the petitioner as the elected representative. “Even assuming that there was a mistake by the returning officer or the people involved in counting the counting process and the declaration was issued without proper counting of votes in Form 25, once the Form 25 is issued, the returning officer becomes funtus officio and he or she has no power to entertain the application for recounting as per the Rule 66 of Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994, which deals with the recounting of votes,” observed the judges while restraining the authorities from swearing in Priyadharshini as the panchayat president till January 10. The judges also issued notice to the state government and directed the registry to post the matter before the appropriate bench for hearing on January 8.

Vijayawada: While opposition parties and farmers continued to protest against the GN Rao and BCG recommendations that Amaravati, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool be developed as cities representing three distinct capital functions, animal husbandry, fisheries and marketing minister Mopidevi Venkata Ramana tried to justify the decentralisation of administration and development on Saturday.

Addressing the media, he said the people of north coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema have on several occasions conducted agitations for their uplift but to no avail. “Keeping all these issues in view, all the committees have recommended decentralisation of administration and development,” said the minister.” Apart from Mopidevi, other YSRC MLAs — Gudivada Amarnath and Sidiri Appalaraju — too have come out in support of the report. The MLAs said the government has Rs 2.50 lakh crore debt and Rs 1 lakh crore would be required for the development of Amaravati.

Sadek Molla

KOLKATA: Dum Dum market’s vegetable vendor Sadek Molla has hit the jackpot. Lady Luck almost slipped out of Mollah’s hands, literally, as he had thrown away his five lottery tickets in the dustbin. But as luck would have it, he scavenged through the waste and fished out the tickets to see he had won Rs 1 crore from one and Rs 4 lakh from four others.

The 36-year-old resident of Bhangor’s Kasipur and his wife, Amena Begum, are overwhelmed. “I can now send our son to a good school in Kolkata,” Amena said. Molla has booked an SUV for Rs 12 lakh.

On New Year’s Day, Molla bought the five Nagaland lottery tickets of the Dear series for Rs 6 each. On January 2, fellow vendors at the Dum Dum market told him he had not won any prize. To cross-check, he visited the lottery counter near his home and there, too, he heard he hadn’t won anything. Disappointed, he threw away the tickets in a dustbin. But the next day, while he was headed for market, the lottery seller stopped him and asked for his tickets. “I threw them away,” Molla said. But when the seller told him he had actually won the first prize, Molla dropped everything and ran to the dustbin. Bystanders looked on as he foraged through the waste. He finally found the tickets and jumped in joy. “I have won Rs 1 crore in lottery,” he said. The four other tickets, too, bagged Rs 1 lakh each. He will reportedly get the money three months later.

As the word spread, the manager of the local branch of a bank asked Molla to deposit the money in the bank. “I don’t have a PAN card,” Sadek told the manager. “Don’t worry, I will help you get it done,” the manager said.

226,['5/01/2020'],"Botcha accuses Naidu of misleading ryots, spreading lies","This story is from January 5, 2020

State minister for municipal administration Botcha Satyanarayana slammed N Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday for spreading lies about Amaravati.

Satyanarayana, who launched several development projects in the temple city of Tirupati on the day, spoke to reporters on a range of issues, including the TDP’s ‘‘Save Amaravati” campaign.

“Naidu is desperately trying to instigate state government employees to stage protests against the government over the relocation of the capital. Naidu who was never bothered about farmers’ plight is now shedding crocodile tears for them that is nothing but a way to garner support,” he said. Satyanarayana recalled that several committees in the past, including the Justice Srikrishna committee and the Sivaramakrishna committee, had clearly underlined the need to ensure decentralised development of the state.

“The committees also suggested not to make Amaravati the capital as thousands of acres of arable land would perish. But Naidu went against the recommendations and tried to establish the capital in Amaravati and centralise development”, alleged the municipal administration minister.

“Naidu claims that his government spent Rs 10,000 crore for constructing the state capital and that the present government has to spend only Rs 3,000 crore to complete the remaining work. This is totally false. Naidu’s government had called tenders to execute various development work worth Rs 52,000 crore towards establishing the capital in Amaravati as part of the first phase alone. Why did you call for tenders then if capital construction can be completed with just Rs 3,000 crore more”, Botsa questioned.

Alleging that the TDP government had wasted Rs 842 crore public money on consultants alone, he questioned Naidu if the figures are not true. Reiterating that the government under the leadership of YS Jaganmohan Reddy was committed to ensure the development of all the 13 districts, Satyanarayana warned Naidu and his party to refrain from misleading the people.

Viswajeet was then transferred to report to the director general of police at Andhra Pradesh police headquarters in Mangalagiri.

Anjaneyulu would also hold full additional charges as transport commissioner and Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC) until further orders. The chief secretary Nilam Sawhney issued the government order with this regard.

The decision does not come as a surprise as just two days ago chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy had conducted a review meeting with the ACB officials and expressed dissatisfaction over its performance.

The chief minister had even asked the officials not to be lethargic and that they need to be more involved and dedicated. He had directed them not to take leaves and ensure effective results within three months when the next review meeting would be held.

Youth under the banner of Nagpur Youth Organization (NYO), took out a peaceful march under tight police watch ... Read More

NAGPUR: The city youths after two unsuccessful attempts on December 21 and January 2 finally gathered to register their first protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act at Samvidhan Square here on Saturday.

The 80 something youth, under the banner of Nagpur Youth Organization (NYO), took out a peaceful march under tight police watch without the support of any organization or political outfit. “We were expecting a bigger crowd. But we are happy that we could convey our message to the Centre,” said an activist of NYO.

The youths planned their first march outside VNIT gate on December 21, 2019 against CAA but the permission was withdrawn at the last minute for unexplained reasons. A handful of those gathered were forcibly evicted from the spot by policemen. On January 2 also, the protest was withdrawn as Union home minister Amit Shah, the brain behind the law, was in the city.

Expressing their anger against the suppression of dissent, youths read out poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s lines, ‘Hum dekhenge, laazmi hai ki hum bhi dekhenge’, and lyricist Varun Grover’s satire, ‘Hum kagaz nahi dikhayenge’, beside strong calls for ‘Azaadi’ from terrorism, poverty, unemployment, attacks on women, pollution, hunger, infant deaths, bigotry, social injustice, etc.

The youths slammed the National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and National Population Register (NPR) on which the Modi government did a complete U-turn since December 29.

A protester said the fear of alleged police excesses were writ large on the minds of several youths who wanted to come but were apprehensive especially after what happened at VNIT gate and in several parts of Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka .

NYO representatives said, “This is just a beginning. We expected the opposition parties to do this but sadly we had to do their roles. Someone had to do it and hence we came forward. We aim to initiate a dialogue in society,” they said.

Alike the ‘azaadi’ sloganeering elsewhere in the country, these youths shouted, “Azaadi Azaadi Azaadi. tum goli chalao…tum police bula lo….garib mange, mahila mange, azaadi … atankwaad se, bhukhmari se, berozgari se azaadi.”

A group of middle-aged working Muslim women too joined the youths. “Are all other issues prevalent in the country resolved that the government is worried about this mission only? We are followers of the Constitution and we are here for all our brothers and sisters,” they said.

A woman teacher said, “Modi and Shah have been dragging the country 70 years behind.”

Madurai: Family politics is a hotly debated topic in every election, but take the just concluded rural local body elections in the state and people seem to have given a thumbs up to the trend. Be it Sivakasi or Kanyakumari, couples, siblings or parents and their children have won various posts in the unions together.

V Vivegan Raj, 38, an MBA graduate and Sivakasi south union DMK secretary, and his wife V Muthulakshmi have won the seats they contested comfortably. Raj contested the post of ward 7 member and his wife ward 6 in the Sivakasi panchayat union. ``I came into politics because my father was a DMK member and I liked the party, but now my responsibility has increased and I will do the best for my people,’’ says Vivekan who faced the union secretaries of AIADMK, DMDK and AMMK in a tough fight. He won on a margin of 180 votes while his wife had a more comfortable victory with over 575 votes. ``People only ask for better roads, water and street lights, which can be provided if elected representatives wish to,’’ says he.

In Kanyakumari, Sudalai Andi of AIADMK was elected president of Kulasekarapuram panchayat and his wife the panchayat union ward member. Sudalai Andi won with a margin of 423 votes while his wife Shanmugavadivu who contested the post of north Thamaraikulam panchayat union councillor won comfortably. In Kadaladi in Ramanathapuram, a man and his two daughters have won the local body posts. K Muniasamy Pandian, 57, former chairman of the Kadaladi union, contested the post of ward 16 member of the union for AIADMK. He also fielded his daughters, the elder one Muthulakshmi, 24, in ward 15 and the younger daughter Ramalakshmi, 22, in ward 4 in the union. All of them won hands down and the AIADMK also managed to bag 11 of the 25 seats in the union.

In Dindigul, a man and his daughter, both of DMK, emerged victorious. S Ulaganathan contested the panchayat president’s post in Pillayarnatham panchayat while his daughter Maheswari contested for the 6th ward of the Athoor panchayat union. Both of them got 1,200 votes more than their opponents. They credit the developmental activities in the union carried out by former DMK minister I Periyasamy for their facile victory.

However, it was a different story in Theni where a man lost and his wife won. Rajkumar contested the post of panchayat president in Ramasamy Nayakkanpatti panchayat in Uthamapalayam union and lost. His wife, Selvi of AIADMK, won the councillor post of ward 4 member in Uthamapalayam panchayat union.

PUNE: The cybercrime police on Friday registered a case against unidentified fraudsters for using the email-spoofing technique to cheat College of Engineering , Pune (CoEP), of Rs51 lakh.

The incident occurred in October 2018, while a college official submitted a complaint application in January 2019. After investigating the case for several months, the police registered a case.

According to the complaint application, police said, officials of the college received an email on October 8, 2018, from an address that was strikingly similar to that of the college’s director.

The email contained details like the director’s name, designation and other pertinent information, and directed the officials to change the director’s bank accounts’ numbers in the college records.

The college authorities, under the impression that the email was from the institute’s director, made changes in the register and reverted to the sender.

The suspect(s), pretending to be the director, then instructed the college officials to transfer varying sums of money for different purposes, police said. “The officials transferred the money to the account numbers provided by the suspects,” inspector Rajkumar Wakchaure said.

Police said the college officials made payments till October 22, 2018, when a staffer contacted the director’s office to confirm that the payment was received. “However, the director’s office replied in the negative, bringing the fraud to light,” he said.

“We have furnished the details of the emails to the police. We will comply with the investigation,” a senior CoEP official said, declining to go into specifics.

The CoEP director did not respond to calls of SMSs.

A Selvaraj

CHENNAI: A 60-year-old man, who was a chef at some leading hotels in the city, died on January 1 at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital , almost 36 days after he was injured at a construction site in Chromepet.

Police said the deceased A Selvaraj had in November last slipped into an open pit dug up to install a lift at an under-construction hotel site in Chromepet.

The man’s relatives alleged that police didn’t file a negligence case and instead registered a case of ‘accidental fall’ based on the complaint by Selvaraj’s son S Bhuvanesh, 25, of Kelambakkam .

A Raju, Selvaraj’s brother-in-law, said, “We have doubts over Selvaraj’s death. He earned a lot of good faith in the food industry.”

Officials at the hotel site in Chromepet claimed his entry into their premises was unauthorised.

Raju said, “It’s wrong. My uncle went to the place to attend an interview. Now, the officials claim there was no interview for chefs on the day he visited the place.”

Though Selvaraj was injured and admitted in a hospital at Chromepet, the local police didn’t register a case.

Raju said, “We met senior officers and demanded that police register a case. The senior police officers directed the Chromepet police to register a case, but they registered a community service register only on January 2 after my uncle died at the hospital and a first information report (FIR) on Friday.”

Speaking to TOI, hotel official Sekar said Selvaraj had approached him and inquired about a job opportunity as a chef at the hotel. He spoke to me the day he came to the place and later I came to know that he was rescued from the pit dug up for the lift, Sekar said. He added, “I met Selvaraj in the hospital and he responded to me when I called him ‘chef’.”

PUNE: A seven-foot-long portion of the retaining wall of Sangam bridge was damaged after an iron cage structure, weighing around 1 tonne, of an under-construction Metro pillar tilted and fell on it around 10am on Saturday. Nobody on the bridge or the work site was injured.Made of iron bars, the cage is the frame of the pillar.The mishap took place at the College of Engineering Pune (CoEP) end of the bridge. Soon after, the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation (MahaMetro) pressed into service a crane, besides other machinery, to pull back the tilted portion of the iron cage structure. “The damaged portion of the retaining wall will be repaired by Sunday,” a MahaMetro official said.The MahaMetro said the cage structure was tied up with ropes to hold it together. These ropes were to be removed after the shuttering work of the pillar was complete. “In the case of this particular pillar, however, the ropes were removed before the shuttering work was completed. This caused the iron cage structure to tilt towards the bridge and eventually fall on about seven-foot-long portion of the retaining wall, leaving it completely damaged,” the MahaMetro said.The bridge has a walkway just next to the retaining wall. Thankfully, nobody was using the walkway at the time of the mishap, MahaMetro officials said, adding that the traffic movement was not disrupted due to the mishap as the iron structure fell on the retaining wall only and left the carriageway untouched.The site where the mishap occurred is a part of the Metro’s reach-3 segment between Civil Court and Ramwadi . The pillars are being constructed on the riverbed along the Sangam bridge for Metro viaduct, which will cross the river and travel towards the Regional Transport Office (RTO).A MahaMetro official said an internal inquiry had been ordered into the mishap. Besides, repair work has been started on the damaged portion of the bridge’s retaining wall. “MahaMetro has issued notice to the contractor for negligence and a fine has been imposed on him as per the terms and conditions of the contract and rules. We have also told the contractor to take utmost precaution at the work sites to ensure the safety of people, including workers,” he said.The MahaMetro also inspected the pillar following the mishap. It said the foundation of the pillar was intact and only the upper portion of the cage was damaged. “There was no need to demolish the pillar,” it added.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73103606,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-985274,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-pillars-frame-falls-on-sangam-bridge-none-hurt/articleshow/73103606.cms

Nagpur: In a clear indication of alarming scenario of unemployment in the country, a whopping 96,845 candidates applied for the post of just 36 peons at the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, and among them many are graduates, postgraduates (PGs) doctors and engineers. This was revealed by HC registrar Atul Shah, who interviewed some of the candidates, to RTI activist Abhay Kolarkar.

Though the administration refused to give classification of how many graduates, PGs, engineers and doctors had actually applied for it, Shah confirmed that there were many graduates and PGs, who were part of the interview process.

He said the administration do not have any specific data of applicants’ educational qualifications because scrutiny of all applications are conducted by MahaOnline, a portal of the state government. “We had published an advertisement on August 2 last year where applications were invited from the candidates having minimum qualifications of seventh standard cleared. Those with 10th and 12th standard passed with computer knowledge were given preference,” the registrar told TOI.

Sources in the HC, however, revealed to TOI that even many engineering diploma holders and other higher qualifications had applied for the peons’ and the clerks’ posts advertised by the HC administration. “We never anticipated such a massive response for a lower post. But, we conducted entire process very transparently and appointed all 36 of them. So far, we have inducted about 10 of them while others will be asked join eventually, as and when old employees retired,” the sources said.

The HC’s reply to Kolarkar queries informed that it has charged Rs50 from every applicant and collected Rs48.62 lakh from over 96,000 candidates.

Another RTI query by Sanjay Thool revealed that the HC administration received 42,725 applications for the 64 posts of clerks. It collected 48.42 lakh from the applicants towards application fees.

In reply to his query, the HC registry informed that the selection was done through stringent scoring pattern where academic performance was taken into account. After scrutiny, 380 peons and 640 clerks were shortlisted.

Further screening reduced their numbers to 122 peons and 151 clerks. Their interviews were conducted on November 6, the registry said.

High drama prevailed at the Anantapur rural police station on Saturday after former TDP MP J C Diwakar Reddy , who surrendered at the police station after obtaining anticipatory bail in connection with a case slapped against him for passing derogatory remarks against cops recently, was detained by for several hours.

It may be recalled that on Dec 18, Diwakar Reddy had passed derogatory remarks against the police department in the presence of TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu . “The police are dancing to the tunes of ruling party leaders even at the village level. But mark my words, this time when TDP comes back to power, we will make those cops lick our boots. We will also slap cases against all of them,” he had said.

The comments drew flak from various quarters and a complaint was lodged against him by Anantapur district police officers’ association president Triloknath, following which Anantapur rural police registered a case against Diwakar Reddy under sections 153 and 506 of IPC.

On Saturday, the former MP, who managed to obtain anticipatory bail from a local court in Anantapur, walked into the rural police station along with his lawyer and surrendered himself. As the court had granted bail on his personal surety along with five other sureties, Diwakar Reddy submitted his bail papers along with the sureties to the cops.

But as hours passed by and he did not come out of the police station, his followers led by TDP’s Anantapur president BK Parthasaradhi staged protests in front of the police station and raised slogans against the government and the police department.

Anantapur SP B Satya Yesubabu rubbished the claims. “The department was following due procedures,” said Yesubabu. Diwakar Reddy was finally released in the evening.

LUCKNOW: A little less than four years ago, he shouted anti-Modi slogans. Today, he holds a responsible post of a state president of Lohia Vahini, Samajwadi Party ’s auxiliary organisation. Meet 35-year-old Ram Karan Nirmal, a master of laws (LLM) gold medalist who raised anti-Modi slogans in the presence of the prime minister at Babsaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University’s convocation in January 2016 to protest against the death of Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula.

Happy with his new job, Nirmal, a native of Charwa village in UP’s Kaushambi district says, “I was preparing for judicial services in New Delhi when the news of Rohith’s suicide hit the nation. I was aghast with the incident. A student was forced to end his life due to injustice and indignity. This was unacceptable and I decided to be part of the protest.”

During the protest, Nirmal was among the many who were detained by the police. “It was very cold but the police charged the protesters with water cannons,” he recalls. Amid the protest, he got information of the PM’s visit to BBAU for its convocation. “I was also told that he (PM) will be handing gold medals to toppers,” Nirmal says.

And without giving a thought, this Dalit youth who was a topper in his LLM courses came to Lucknow. This, he says was the right place to stage a protest against discrimination shown to Dalits. Seconds after the PM started with his convocation address, Nirmal along with his Dalit friend Amrendra Arya shouted, ‘Modi Go Back’, and ‘Rohith Vemula hum sharminda hai, tere qatil abhi zinda hai’ (Rohith Vemula we are ashamed, your murderers are still alive) slogans.

“We were successful. How could a PM keep mum on a suicide of a student due to discrimination? This was my concern for the society,” asserts Nirmal, who was taken into preventive custody by the police, and his degree was held back by the university for a few days.

Vijayawada: Krishna district police as part of their Operation Muskaan rescued 331 children , including 90 girls, on Saturday. Meanwhile, in a bid to achieve the goals of the operation, which seeks to rescue and rehabilitate children, Krishna district police adopted three areas, where child-labour is rampant, to ensure their.

Speaking to STOI, ASP M Sathi Babu explained that they have decided to adopt three specific areas where kids either beg or are engaged in child labour. These include — railway station, Drivers’ Colony and Narayanapuram. “While the district SP (M Ravindranath Babu) is looking into Narayanapuram area, I will take care of Drivers Colony and the Machilipatnam DSP Mehboob Baasha will be looking after railway station area,” Babu told STOI.

As part of the project, police officials said they would boost every-day surveillance in these areas where they have arranged for means of education for street kids, acquainted with the last few Operation Muskaan drives. Local NGOs, women and child welfare department and local Shakti Teams will help the police in it. Officials said that they would ensure that all the children get education as they have noticed a large number of children, whom they had rescued in the past, still engaged in child labour.

On the other hand, Vijayawada commissionerate police too conducted the same operation within the city limits and rescued 128 children. Interestingly, they also rescued around 12 migrant kids from Rajasthan. As per data collected under Operation Muskaan, usually, most of the children from other states, who were rescued, who used to either work or beg in Vijayawada would either be from Bihar or Uttar Pradesh.

City police commissioner CH Dwaraka Tirumala Rao addressed the media and said that the parents and the children would be counselled. He said that each police station has implemented Balala Mitra, a friendly police initiative for kids and that they can approach the police any time for any problem.

The second rake on the Metro viaduct near Pimpri

PUNE: The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) has loaded the second rake on the Metro viaduct near Pimpri to start the preliminary trials and inspections, days after the first rake was placed on the tracks on December 30.

As the MahaMetro is yet to provide power supply on the track, a battery-operated shunting engine , which can pull one rake easily, has been introduced for moving the rakes on the track. “During the preliminary trials, MahaMetro will check various parameters like alignment of tracks, vibrations generated by the movement of rakes as well as their impact and rake positioning on the track,” a MahaMetro official said.

Of the two rakes, one plied on about 1km stretch in the last two days. A senior MahaMetro official said, “There is no fixed schedule for running of the rakes. These trials are meant to ensure accuracy and will go on for the next few days.”

The rakes were lifted to the Sant Tukaramnagar Metro station. The MahaMetro plans to introduce Metro operations between Sant Tukaramnagar and Phugewadi stations on priority. However, testing and trials of the rakes are planned on the entire stretch, which begins from Pimpri.

MahaMetro officials said cable manufacturing for power supply had already started in the yard. “The installation of the cables is expected to begin next week,” an official said.

He said different agencies were working simultaneously on the viaduct and at the Metro stations to expedite the work. “The work on dedicated power sub-station at Vallabhnagar has been completed. Another sub-station is coming up at Vanaz,” the official added.

242,['5/01/2020'],"Reprieve for Fadnavis, CJM adjourns hearing till Jan 24","This story is from January 5, 2020

Nagpur: Leader of opposition in state assembly Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday received a reprieve from the chief judicial magistrate’s (CJM) court after his application for adjournment of hearing in a case filed by lawyer Satish Uke was accepted.

The CJM has now directed Fadnavis’s counsel Uday Dable to make him appear in the court on January 24 for replying to the summons issued to him. This is second reprieve for the South West Nagpur MLA, who was earlier allowed to skip the court proceedings on December 4, when he was asked to appear by JMFC court.

Uke had accused Fadnavis of suppressing information about two pending criminal cases while filing affidavit for nomination form during 2014 assembly polls.

After this case was remanded back by the Supreme Court to trial court, JMFC judge SB Mehta issued summons to the five-time MLA on November 4, asking him to remain present on December 4 to defend charges against him.

After Dable sought the ex-chief minister’s exemption from appearance citing “unavoidable circumstances” due to winter session of state legislature, the hearing was adjourned to January 4.

On Saturday, Dable submitted an application stating that being a leader of opposition Fadnavis was touring to meet hailstorm affected farmers in the state. Moreover, he was also touring various places for forthcoming zilla parishad polls and therefore, he couldn’t attend the hearing.

His contentions were strongly opposed by applicant Uke stating that Fadnavis was misleading the court and wasting its time. He even moved an application for producing the former CM in the court with police’s help. But the CJM allowed Dable’s application.

In his complaint, Uke had mentioned about two criminal cases in 1996 and 1998 pertaining to Fadnavis, where he was accused of cheating and forgery. The latter had furnished PR bond of Rs3,000 in one of them at that time.

Uke’s complaint was dismissed on September 7, 2015, however, the sessions court remanded back the case to same court for reconsideration.

Fadnavis later filed an appeal in Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court which granted him “clean chit” on May 3, 2018, by upholding the JMFC’s order of September 2015 and quashing session court’s verdict.

After Uke challenged HC’s orders in the apex court, it remanded back the case to JMFC on October 1 to ascertain whether a case for prosecution is made out or not.

Rudrapur: Last month’s heavy rainfall in Terai region is believed to have damaged some perishable crops such as peas. Farmers in the region said that 1,214 metric tonnes of peas is estimated to have been damaged in Udham Singh Nagar district although the main Rabi crop of wheat may survive the inclement weather.

“Mustard was affected by heavy rain and strong gust of winds in the district. Pea crop has incurred a loss of more than Rs 1.2 crore for farmers of Kashipur, Sitarganj and Dineshpur. We have met the district magistrate for analysing the crop damage and compensation distribution,” Arun Sharma, president of Kisan Sangh, said.

HC Tiwari, the district’s chief horticulture officer, told TOI, “Pea growers have suffered losses as their crops are affected by rain. The district grows pea crops in 3,599 hectare of land. This season, heavy rain has damaged pea crops everywhere in the district.” The effect of fewer yields is already reflecting in the market where peas are selling at Rs 30 per kg as compared to Rs 10-Rs 15 per kg during the same period last year. “Preliminary reports of damage to crops, mainly perishable, indicate a loss of Rs 12 lakh, but it will take a few more days to assess the exact amount of loss,” Tiwari said.

He pointed out that “wheat is expected to gain from precipitation, though there could be a marginal yield loss in places affected by hailstorm.” “Since wheat crop did not attain height yet, it remains unaffected from the wind and rain,” Tiwari said.

Madurai: A history-sheeter from Tuticorin was stabbed to death by a 30-year-old man who was staying with him temporarily in Kodaikanal in Dindigul district on Friday night. Inquiries revealed that the murder took place due to a dispute related to money transaction between the two.

The Kodaikanal police have registered a case and arrested the accused. The deceased was identified as Johnson Arockiaraj, 58, from Thiraviyapuram in Tuticorin.

According to police sources, Johnson’s friend, Albert had taken the contract of the toilet. However, Albert was not able to manage it and hence had leased it to Johnson. Meanwhile, Johnson had taken a few lakh rupees from Saravanan, from State Bank Colony in Tuticorin to pay Albert.

As Johnson failed to return the money, Saravanan came to Kodaikanal to collect money from Johnson and stayed with him. Meanwhile, the duo consumed liquor on Friday night. Soon after, a dispute broke out between them in connection with the money and Saravanan in a fit of rage took a knife and stabbed Johnson. As he died on the spot, Saravanan, 30, went to the Kodaikanal police station and surrendered.tnn

245,['5/01/2020'],Migratory birds face starvation as water turns toxic at Uppalapadu sanctuary,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Guntur: At the Uppalapadu Bird Sanctuary on the outskirts of Guntur city, starvation deaths among migratory birds have become a common ocurrence. With the onset of winter every year, flocks of birds from other continents and interior Asia make their way to the sanctuary, build nests and forage for food for their chicks. This year, the lack of food and fish in the tank in the sanctuary has precipitated a crisis, forcing the birds to travel longer distances in search of food for their young. Visits by officials of the forest department to take stock of the situation are few and far between. “The situation in the sanctuary is grim. Chicks are dying due to shortage of food in the tank. Officials should take immediate measures to conserve the population of the birds,” said NV Sarathchandra, a bird conservationist.

Chairman of the Uppalapadu sanctuary development committee Perumalla Anil confirmed that the forest department had not spared funds for feeding the birds in the sanctuary. “Birds have to travel far to fetch fish. They do not feed here,” he told TOI. Anil added that he had initiated measures to clean the tank.

Locals, meanwhile, said that birds have been arriving in groups numbering between 1,000 to 2,000 and around 20,000 to 25,000 have already taken shelter in and around the sanctuary. Migratory birds from Russia, Mongolia and Siberia have been sheltering together in large groups in the absence of adequate maintenance of the sanctuary, leading to congestion and spread of disease.

“The birds are faced with acute space shortage. Every inch of the space available near the tank is occupied,” said M Mohanrao, a resident of Uppalapadu. The issue has been brought to the notice of officials of the forest department, he added.

Recalling a similar incident at Sambhar lake in Rajasthan, Sarathchandra said officials should act before large numbers of birds face starvation. “More than 17,000 migratory birds died at Sambhar lake, a Ramsar wetland site, due to negligence,” he said.

The Uppalapadu Bird Sanctuary, which lies between agricultural fields, faces contamination from chemical runoff from the fields. Water from the fields contains high levels of pesticides and residues of chemical fertilizers, which eventually makes its way to the tank. Diverting this waste is crucial, said Sarathchandra, adding that the forest department should conduct awareness programmes in the nearby villages to discourage the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

“Uppalapadu Bird Sanctuary has been in a state of neglect and lacks proper maintenance. One significant issue which needs to be addressed is the serious depletion of fish stock in the sanctuary. As the migratory birds come here to breed, lack of abundant fish stock to feed their young will discourage birds in the future,” said Ravikiran, an engineering student and bird watcher. He added that fish stock must be improved by continuously replenishing the water with native fish.

A staffer at the sanctuary on the condition of anonymity admitted that birds were dying due to shortage of food and space but stocking fish in the tank would ease the situation. Guntur divisional forest officer Ramachandra Rao, however, said claims of bird deaths due to starvation were false.

Nagpur: A day after reports of change in his ministry emerged, cabinet minister Nitin Raut on Saturday said he was happy that a Dalit was given an important portfolio of Public Works Department (PWD) for first time in the state. He also said that he will “abide by whichever responsibility entrusted by the party”.

His reaction came after PWD ministry was handed over to former chief minister and ex-MPCC president, Ashok Chavan, after latter took an oath in second cabinet expansion. Now, Raut has been handed over the power ministry which was earlier looked by former Kamptee MLA Chandrashekhar Bawankule.

“I am not upset as speculated in the media. I was only pointing out that never before a Dalit was given a charge of PWD and I was fortunate. I will work with full dedication and integrity in any portfolio as I am a dedicated soldier of Congress party,” he told TOI.

Raut’s supporters, however, were upset over the development, terming it as “yet another injustice” to Vidarbha by the grand old party. According to them, the western Maharashtra netas always try to dominate their counterparts from the backward region. In Raut’s case, they have snatched the plum ministry offered to him and given him the portfolio where Vidarbha was rich in all aspects, being a power surplus region, they claimed.

The supporters added that Raut would be obviously upset over the way an important portfolio was taken away from him to accommodate the senior. He had even started his work in full swing and directed PWD officials in the state to repair and maintain all roads.

“It’s a clear case of injustice towards Vidarbha. On one hand, you handed over an important ministry to a backward candidate and took credit. A month later, you snatched his portfolio just because a senior wants it. He shouldn’t have given the PWD ministry at the first instance,” Congress spokesperson Sandesh Singalkar said.

He said Vidarbha would always take back seat in any government and only statehood could ensure justice to the backward region.

Endorsing him, national coordinator of All India Unorganized Workers Congress, Trisharan Sahare, said such instances on Vidarbha netas was not new and irrespective of any party’s government, the region would always remain neglected. “It was a proud moment for Vidarbha as a Dalit was entrusted with such an important portfolio and removing it from him is very unfortunate. Instead, the Thackeray government should have given more representation to the backward districts like Gadchiroli, Washim, Bhandara and Gondia in the ministership. But they removed a highly efficient person who would have made the difference to this backward region,” he said.

The North Nagpur MLA had taken oath of a cabinet minister along with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on November 28. He was only one from Vidarbha in the first list of ministers and was awarded PWD portfolio along with other ministries. He was only backward face in the first list of ministers.

247,['5/01/2020'],Strong objection to playground user change plan,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) proposal to change user of city’s biggest playground — Patwardhan ground, Yashwant Stadium and adjoining land — continues to witness strong objection. All 30 individuals and associations who appeared before the civic body for hearing registered their objection against the proposal.

The state government owes 17.53 acres land between Panchsheel Square and Mehadiya Chowk at Dhantoli. There are some shops on Wardha Road followed by Tilak Patrakar Bhavan, government library, Patwardhan ground which is being used for parking city buses, slum on its rear side and Yashwant stadium.

The entire area is 140% more than Kasturchand Park and reserved for recreational open space/playground in city’s development plan.

City MP and Union minister Nitin Gadkari had proposed to develop entire area into Central Business District (CBD). Accordingly, the NMC started process to change user of entire area to Yashwant stadium and commercial. The existing stadium will be demolished and a new one will be part of CBD.

The NMC invited suggestions and objections in September to which 49 individuals and organizations responded. Municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar held hearing for 30 on Friday and Saturday. Others are likely to be given chance on Tuesday.

NMC sources told TOI that even Dhantoli Nagrik Mandal has opposed the proposal. The residents fear congestion will increase manifold if CBD is developed. Some also opposed demolition of stadium which is not too old. Owners of shops situated below stadium and those located on Wardha road, Patrakar Bhavan also registered their objection.

Nine years ago, the HC had directed the government to take back entire area from the NMC and use it for playground but it was never done. The civic body’s ongoing process is also violation of HC’s orders.

248,['5/01/2020'],IGI Airport: Directorate General of Civil Aviation wants action against unruly Air India passengers,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Videos have emerged showing some passengers banging on the cockpit door and asking the pilots to come out

NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has asked Air India (AI) to act against unruly passengers who banged on the cockpit door and misbehaved with the crew of a delayed Delhi-Mumbai flight on Thursday (January 2). While threatening to break open the door, some passengers had asked the Boeing 747’s pilots to come out of the cockpit and explain the situation a few hours after the jumbo jet had returned to the terminal at Indira Gandhi International Airport from the runway due to a technical snag.

The airline said it will decide on the issue of beginning proceedings under the strict No-Fly List against the unruly passengers of this flight after a thorough probe. India also now has a No-Fly List under which disruptive passengers can be barred from flying for upto a lifetime depending on the gravity of their unruly behaviour.

DGCA chief Arun Kumar said: “We have asked AI to act against the unruly behaviour.” AI spokesman Dhananjay Kumar said: “AI 865 of January 2 was considerably delayed due to technical reasons. The management has asked the operating crew for a detailed report on the reported misbehaviour by some passengers. Further action will be considered after getting the report.”

The 24-year-old B747 (VT-EVA) named “Agra” was to operate as AI 865 at 10.10am on Thursday. “Passengers had boarded the flight by 9.15am. The aircraft taxied out at 10am and returned from the taxiway in about 10 minutes. Attempts were made to rectify the snag. Finally passengers were asked to alight from the plane at about 2.20pm and flown to Mumbai by another aircraft at 6pm,” said an AI official. So there was a delay of eight hours in the passengers taking off for their destination.

While airlines should do their best to minimise passenger woes during flight delays, unruly behaviour by flyers targeting crew is unacceptable globally. “Passengers being made to wait inside an aircraft for hours is regrettable and should not happen. But the fact is this happens in almost every airline and will passengers have the courage to act as unruly as they did on a foreign airline or even a private Indian one?” asked a senior pilot.

Problems on board Agra began when passengers got restive after waiting for more than a couple of hours for the snag to be rectified. Videos have emerged showing some young passengers banging on the cockpit door, asking the pilots to come out. “Captain please one out… Loser come out… Come out or we will break the door…” they were yelling at the cockpit crew. Cockpit is on the upper deck of B747s, where AI and many other airlines have their business class.

One of the passengers in the videos even knows that doing so is against the law and can be heard saying “I do not have a criminal record and don’t want one.” When AI finally asks passengers to alight from the aircraft, another video shows a passenger trying to open the door even as the crew are in the process of doing so. Her co-passengers ask her to step aside and let the cabin crew open the door. “Don’t do this they will open it,” co-passengers are seen telling this person.

A senior pilot said if an aircraft is suspected to have a snag, the crew will not let it operate a flight till the same is rectified. “Passengers need to understand that. No one knows how long a snag rectification will take to rectify and that’s why airlines don’t immediately ask passengers to alight to avoid further delay by repeating the boarding process once the plane is good to go,” said the pilot.

India recently enacted rules to punish unruly or disruptive passengers who can face a ban on flying for up to a lifetime. The first level of disruptive behaviour includes “physical gestures, verbal harassment and unruly inebriation”. The next level has “physically abusive behaviour” like pushing, kicking and includes “inappropriate touching or sexual harassment”. The highest level is for “life-threatening behaviour, damage to aircraft operating system, physical violence such as choking, eye gouging, murderous assault, attempted or actual breach of” cockpit.

A passenger charged under the first level can be grounded for up to three months; up to six months under the second level and for third level, grounding can be upwards of two years with no maximum limit (meaning up to a lifetime). For repeat offenders in the same level, the period of grounding is doubled.

Last May, a Mumbai jeweller had become the first person to be put on the NFL following his disruptive behaviour on a flight of now-grounded Jet Airways.

“This is an expression to show our anguish against CAA and NRC. We want the government to revoke CAA and scrap NRC. I came all the way from Rajendranagar,’’ Mohammed Afroze, a degree student, told STOI.

A 28-year-old accountant Mohammed Rafeeq of Shalibanda said he set out from his home at 1.30 pm after the noon prayers to the rally venue. He said it took them nearly one-and-a-half hour to reach Dharna Chowk from his place.

Along with Rafeeq, 50 colony residents also reached Dharna Chowk. He along with others held aloft the placards. “We don’t want uneducated people in governance who do not know what to do and what not to do,” he said.

Some protesters came up innovative slogans on their placards. “Hum paper se Hindustani nahi hai, hum khoon se Hindustani hai (We are not Hindustanis on paper, our blood is of Hindustani)” read one such placard.

The organisers distributed pamphlets to protesters, explaining the finer details on CAA, NRC and National Population Register (NPR) for their benefit.

Kolkata: The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation will take up the repairs of certain stretches in Salt Lake to ensure a smooth ride to the International Kolkata Book Fair 2020, scheduled to be organised at the Central Park ground from January 29 to February 9.

The civic authorities have floated tenders to engage contractors to take up the project urgently. Work is supposed to start from the end of next week and the agencies are expected to complete the repairs before the book fair starts.

The authorities have set aside a budget of over Rs 1.3 crore for this. Civic officials said the focus of the repairs was the roads leading to the fair ground as thousands of vehicles are expected to head there for those two weeks.

Among the important stretches that have sprung large potholes are the two flanks from Anindita Island to Tank 13, the road from Tank 13 to the Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan island, from Tank 9 to the lane going inside DL Block, Tank 9 island to the canal side road, several lanes inside DL and EE blocks in front of Karunamoyee and the areas adjacent to the Central Park fair ground, where most of the vehicles will head for. Besides, plans are on to repair the pavement spots, where paver blocks had come off, surrounding the fair ground.

Romance and beauty are the hallmarks of the rasa

AHMEDABAD: In her recitals, Dr Viraj Amar enforces attention with the authority of a calm truth. She presents even the trickiest passages with unhurried rapture, her Banaras Gharana affiliation intensifying her radiance on the stage. “I chose Chayanat, which is informed by the Shringar Rasa,” Dr Amar told TOI. Romance and beauty are the hallmarks of the rasa. “It is a beautiful but difficult raga because it is structured,” she said.

Those who missed her Chayanat exposition on Day 3 of Saptak, on Friday, can refer to a 2014 YouTube video which presents her earlier essay of the raga. The video shows her capacity to find the infinity of substance even within the well-defined structure of a style.

The finale of Day 3 was Ayaan Ali Bangash’s sarod performance. He played Tilak Kamod and Kirwani. Like his father, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Ayaan Ali Bangash elucidates musical intricacies with generosity and clarity. TOI asked him to explain the nine and a quarter beats around which his Kirwani was organized.

“This taal is inspired by the South Indian system as it’s not a traditional taal,” he told TOI. “However, the oceanic world of Indian rhythmic time cycles allows these out-of-the-box taals to be played.” Taal has a Sanskrit root that means “handclapping, musical time”.

Ustad Amjad Ali Khan was pleased with the warm reception his son’s recital had received. “I am proud of Amaan and Ayaan,” Khan-sahab told TOI. “Thank God we all don’t sound alike! The credit goes to their mother and first guru, Subhalakshmi Borooah.”

PUNE: Various parts of Swargate are experiencing load shedding on a rotational basis since Wednesday after the extra high voltage power line of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited developed a major fault.

A statement issued by the distribution company on Saturday said the repair work was undertaken on a war footing and the power supply would be restored by Sunday.

According to the statement, a supply line coming from the 220/132KV Parvati sub-station to the GSI Rasta Peth sub-station developed a fault at 8am on Wednesday.

Vijayawada: The state government is set to launch ‘Jagananna Amma Vodi ’, which seeks to encourage mothers to send their children to schools, on January 9. The state government issued four orders releasing Rs 6,108 crore for the scheme on Saturday. All mothers who belong to below poverty line will be given Rs 15,000 every year to help them send their children to school .

Amma Vodi was one of the election promises made by chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy. It is also one of the flagship programmes of YSRC’s Navaratnalu. The scheme aims at increasing the number of schoolgoing students in the state and enhance the quality of education.

The financial assistance would be provided to all mothers or guardians irrespective of the number of children at their home. The mother or the guardian should be a white ration card holder and ensure that the student must have 75% attendance. In case of dropout from school or college, the scheme would not be applicable to the beneficiary. Government employees and income taxpayers are not eligible for the scheme.

The scheme is applicable from 2019-20, in all the government, private-aided, private-unaided schools and junior colleges, which include residential schools and college as well. The government has also included orphans and street children in this scheme who are studying in schools through voluntary organisations. The financial assistance will be provided to these organisations after coordination with the departments concerned.

The lists of beneficiaries, which the district collector will prepare, will be displayed at all village and ward secretariats.

255,['5/01/2020'],Noida tapes expose rift between UP IPS officers,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Lucknow: The leaked tapes of Noida SSP have triggered a rift between Indian Police Service (IPS) officers in the state, even as a report by him against five IPS officers to the government and DGP has opened a new front. IPS officers named in the letter have termed the allegations baseless, and also threatened to lodge a defamation suit. In case they file a cross-complaint, then a ‘cold war’ will be out in the open, sources in the police department claim.

The simmering war between a section of IPS officers came out in the open after three sex tapes and several chats on WhatsApp, allegedly between a woman and the SSP Noida, got leaked on social media. In fire-fighting mood, the SSP Noida hurriedly conducted a press conference and allegedly leaked to media details of five IPS officers against whom the former had sent a report to the home department and the DGP.

Interestingly, one of the five accused IPS officers, who is currently on training, told TOI that he learnt of the allegations of posting a constable with criminal antecedents. He stated that he had got all the documents checked and made no such appointments. The officer also said that he was waiting for the government report and then will seek legal action. Similarly, another accused officer said, “He should have lodged an FIR instead.”Other officers also conveyed similar sentiments, clearly hinting at signs of a looming internal war. When DGP OP Singh was asked about war between IPS officers during his press conference on Friday, he had categorically stated that it was untrue and that all the officers work like a team in the state. “The police has worked well and handled all the challenging situations by working together as a force in the past many months,” he added.

The matter is under probe by additional director general of police (Meerut zone), who has sought 15 days’ time.

Mussoorie: The iconic Mussoorie ropeway service, which connects Jhulaghar on the Mall Road with Gunhill, might continue for another year even though in an inspection by BRIDCUL (Bridge, Ropeway, Tunnel and Other Infrastructure Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited) last month, technical flaws were found in the machinery of the four-decade-old ropeway service and accordingly, it was decided to suspend the service from January. At a Mussoorie Municipal Council (MMC) meeting on Friday, the officials agreed upon exploring possibilities of keeping the ropeway operational for one more year.

Speaking to TOI, MMC chairman Anuj Gupta said that the municipal council will try to address the technical flaws in the machinery of the ropeway and subsequently approach BRIDCUL and IIT-Roorkee for conducting a technical inspection of the ropeway and giving a clearance certificate.

“Considering the popularity of the ropeway with tourists and the fact that livelihoods of a number of shopkeepers are dependent on it, we want to continue the service for another year. We hope that technical flaws are addressed soon,” Gupta said.

Meanwhile, the renewal of contract of the agency, which operates the eco-tax barrier at Kohlu Khet, was also done at the board meeting along with a 2% hike in royalty fees.

“The agency is currently paying Rs 2.30 crore to MMC. The board has decided to hike this amount by 2% and renew the contract, which will remain valid till August 2020,” Gupta said.

During the meeting, a proposal for a new parking lot near Civil Hospital was also mooted. The civic body has decided to seek approval for the parking space from the state government.

Students of a government boys’ high school in Kadiri did not fathom that their excursion would end in a nightmare. In the late hours of Friday, a bus carrying 45 students and 10 teachers from the school skidded off the road near Dharwad district in Karnataka and fell into a 500-feet gorge. All but one miraculously escaped death as the trees on the sides of the gorge broke the bus’s fall.

Anantapur SP B Satya Yesu Babu told reporters on Saturday that the group had set out on an excursion to Karnataka on January 2. The group of students and teachers were on their way from Jog Falls to Murudeshwar at around 10.30 pm on Friday night, when the accident took place.

He said, the high school’s headmaster Rajendran first managed to break the rear windshield of the bus and helped a few students reach safety. He later informed his relatives and Anantapur police about the mishap and sought help. Anantapur police in turn passed on the information to their counterparts in Karnataka, who rushed to the spot and rescued the passengers.

While two students sustained grievous injuries, a class 10 student, identified as Baba Fakruddin, succumbed to his injuries. A few other students and teachers sustained minor injuries. The injured were taken to Manipal Hospital in Udupi, where they are undergoing treatment.

Meanwhile, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy, who condoled the death of the class 10 student, directed Anantapur district collector Gandham Chandrudu to extend all necessary medical and logistical support to the group of students and teachers, who have been stranded following the accident and bring them back safely to their home.

Nagpur: An organization working on agrarian issues has accused a local political heavyweight of being complicit in shifting the 118 Territorial Army (TA) from Sitabuldi Fort so that the “prime property could be commercially exploited”.

Addressing the media on Saturday afternoon, Avinash Kakde, president of Kisan Seva Sangh (KSS), alleged that the Sitabuldi Fort is slowly being emptied so that ultimately its purpose will be brought into question.

“It is nothing but a land grab attempt by a very powerful politician from Nagpur. Once the Sitabuldi Fort’s existence comes into question, it will be exploited commercially in the name of maintenance. There is also a possibility of the original owner of the land, a well-known family local family with historical roots, will stake their claim on the property saying it is no longer serving its intended purpose,” Radke said.

“And then, our local politician will come into picture and resolve the issue which will be the final nail in the coffin for Sitabuldi Fort,” said Kakde. Retired personnel from the TA also shared the stage with Kakde while addressing the media.

KSS is now preparing to file a public interest litigation (PIL) over the issue. Retired personnel had already approached the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court when the initial decision to move 118 Territorial Army was taken. However, the final decision did not go in their favour.

Kakde said, “My legal team is working on the documents and we will be filing the PIL with other points related to land origin, its purpose etc.”

Kakde said, “I have written to the PMO and defence ministry about this issue. How can one even think of shifting a territorial army for this region to Bhusawal? That defeats the entire purpose of it being called the Territorial Army.”

“The silence of powerful politicians on this issue means just one thing that there is something fishy. My direct charge is that the decision to remove 118 Battalion from here has been taken with all probability to grab this army land. This smells of collective corruption,” he added.

PUNE: A man was booked on Friday on the charges of posing as an army man and duping an interior designer of Rs 15,300 by issuing him a dud cheque after buying his smartphone at the National War Memorial Chowk between November 22 and 29 last year.

The complainant, Hrishikesh Samose (22), of Rajyognagar in Warje Malwadi had bought a smartphone but soon realized that the device did not meet his requirements.

The Wanowrie police said Samose then posted an advertisement on an e-commerce website to sell the smartphone. “A man posing as an army man then contacted him to buy the smartphone. After considerable negotiations, Samose agreed to sell the phone for Rs 15,300,” a police officer said.

Assistant inspector Asaram Shete from the Wanowrie police said, “The buyer on the pretext of buying the smartphone called Samose to the War Memorial Chowk where he took the device from him against a cheque of Rs 15,300. Samose initially refused to accept the cheque, but the buyer won his confidence after he told Samose that he was an army man.”

Shete said, “Samose accepted the cheque and deposited it in his bank branch at Warje Malwadi. To his utter shock, the cheque bounced. Samose then called up the suspect on numerous occasions, but to no avail.”

“One fine day, he somehow managed to get through to the suspect, following which he agreed to meet him at the War Memorial Chowk for settling the dispute. He, however, did not turn up,” Shete added.

After Samose’s efforts to recover the smart phone or the cash proved futile, he visited the Wanowrie police station and lodged an FIR. “The person has been booked under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code,” Shete added.

Hyderabad: Delayed due to traffic caused because of the Million March , several students from the city missed their Tata Institute of Social Sciences National Entrance Test (TISS-NET) on Saturday. Students said they were denied entry into test centres as they arrived about three-four minutes late. While they made frantic calls to the institute’s helpline number, it failed to yield any result.

“I was only two minutes late. I tried to reason with them and tell them that I was caught in the traffic jam, but they did not allow me for the exam. Now, I have to wait for a whole year to write the entrance examination,” said a student, whose centre was at Old Alwal. He was taking the test for admission into Human Resource Management & Labour Relations.

The candidate said that at least 25 students at the centre were not allowed to appear for the TISSNET for reaching only minutes after the exam started.

While members of student council of TISS said that almost all undergraduate students, who applied for the entrance test, appeared for the examination, they said that the examination staff should have allowed candidates for the exam even if they were late by a few minutes. “There is no way someone could predict traffic today. All roads were congested and everyone was aware of it. So, they could have considered it as extraordinary circumstance,” said a member of the student council.

TISS-NET is a computer-based test with 100 objective type multiple choice questions for admissions to Masters (Master of Arts / Master of Science / BEd-MEd Integrated) programmes.

AHMEDABAD: A 40-year-old resident of Vrajdham in Ghatlodia, Palak Patel, allegedly committed suicide by jumping off the ninth floor of the city civil court in Bhadra on Saturday afternoon.

Police sources said Patel was an assistant clerk at court number 34, and had been employed in the court for the last five years.

Karanj police sources said they have registered a case of accidental death. “The reason for the suicide is not yet known. We have spoken to his colleagues, but they don’t know what caused Patel to commit suicide,” a senior Karanj police station official said.

According to police sources, at about 2pm during the recess hour, Palak climbed up to the 9th floor and jumped to his death from there.

JAIPUR: After the newly introduced fares, rail passengers will have to pay from Rs 10 to Rs 200 more in various classes of trains for different destinations. For Delhi, train passengers will have to pay at least Rs 50 extra, while for other destinations including Howrah, Mumbai and others, passengers will have to pay Rs 100 or more extra.

Railways started charging increased fares of 1 paisa to 4 paisa per km, though there has not been any hike in the reservation and superfast charges of various trains from January 1 onwards. The fares of the trains were increased last in 2014-15.

TOI on Friday spoke to the officials of the NWR to find out the exact increase in the fares, which is going to affect rail passengers travelling from Jaipur to Delhi, Jaipur to Mumbai, Jaipur to Howrah, Jaipur to Bengaluru, Jaipur to Jodhpur and Jaipur to Udaipur .

Delhi passengers travelling in I-AC were earlier paying Rs 1,380 and with the increased fares, the passengers will have to pay Rs 1,395. “Delhi II-AC passengers were paying Rs 830, who are now required to pay Rs 840, for III-AC passengers will have to pay Rs 610 instead of the earlier fare of Rs 595,” said a senior officer of NWR on Friday.

The passengers travelling to Mumbai from Jaipur in I-AC have to pay at least Rs 100 extra for the travel. “Earlier they were required to pay Rs 3,495 but now they will have to pay Rs 3,595. Likewise for the same destination in II-AC, earlier they were paying Rs 2,050 but are now required to pay Rs 2,100,” said an officer.

Even the employees’ unions of the north western railways welcomed the step saying it was “much needed” and “long pending”. “I think to increase the earnings, railways require to increase fares and even platform ticket. We are already running in losses. Also, I would suggest the rail ministry to increase the freight as growth of railways is dependent on freight and fare,” said an office bearer of a railways employees union.

One might indulge in the aroma and flavours of wine out of delight and enjoyment but for Sovna Puri, it’s her passion. Her in-depth knowledge about wine, spirits and beverages has made her the only Indian to feature among the Future 50 award winners announced on November 28 by the Wines & Spirit Education Trust (WSET) and International Wine and Spirit Competition (IWSC).

Born and brought up in Nagpur, Puri chose a very creative and different profession which deals with educating people about wine and other beverages.

Puri was selected from a global list of 600 professionals working in winemaking, distilling, product development, design and distribution, marketing, journalism and hospitality.“I have been working in the field for over 13 years. I have studied hotel management where I was introduced to ‘wine’ as a distinctive subject. Gradually, I started loving its different flavours, aromas and other technical elements which makes one wine different form another,” said Puri.

People from different countries participated in the competition but only a few made it to the list of winners after an in-depth analysis of their technical knowledge, passion and qualification. The purpose of the awards was to recognize and felicitate 50 future influencers of the global beverage industry, who are under the age of 40.

The Future 50 is an initiative by WSET and IWSC to celebrate 50 years of their establishment. Talking about her selection process, Puri said, “The awardees are selected from the wine and spirit industry. They are the ones who are not only talented, but have also made a significant contribution in areas of academia, social responsibility and innovation.”

There were more than 600 nominations in the first round, 200 in the second and 82 in the final list from which 50 were chosen.

Sovna is a level four diploma holder in Wines & Spirits from WSET, London. She is also a WSET certified educator certified to teach WSET courses up to Level 3 in wines, making her one among only two people in India to hold the distinction.

“I have been deeply involved in the Indian wine story for over 13 years. I’m currently working as an independent wine and spirit consultant, educator and trainer. It feels amazing to be the only Indian making it to the list of winners. It was a very thrilling experience overall. Having wine is not a common practice in Indian culture but times are changing and I want people to become more educated about it,” added Puri.

She was also one of fifteen women who were awarded the ‘Phoenix Leading Lady Awards 2019’ under the category ‘Personal Brilliance — Breaking Unconventional Barriers’. A regular contributor to ‘Sommelier India’, India’s first premium wine magazine, Nagpurian Puri now lives in Mumbai.

Jaipur: With arrival of onions from Jhalawar, Nasik (Maharashtra) and Bhavnagar (Gujarat), prices have dropped across the state.

With wholesale prices raging between Rs 20 and Rs 40 per kg, the tuber sold between Rs 40 and Rs 60 per kg in the retail market. Traders at Mohana Mandi said prices would be around Rs 35 to Rs 45 per kg within a week. Since October 2019, onion prices were bringing tears into the eyes of homemakers and were literally away from the reach of common man. In November, onions were imported from Afganistan and Turkey but that too failed to bring down the prices. “We are now getting fresh onions mainly from Nasik, Bhavnagar, Tonk, Mathania and Nagaur which is the reason prices have come down. On Saturday, the small-sized onions were sold for Rs 20 per kg in the wholesale market while the big-sized were priced around Rs 40 per kg. In the retail market, it was sold for Rs 40 to Rs 60 per kg,” said Mukesh Totlani, a wholesale trader of onions at Mohana Mandi of Jaipur.

Traders said the onions from Bhavnagar and Nasik are dominating the market because of its quality. “If the supply continues, retail price would be Rs 35 to Rs 45 per kg from January 15 onwards,” said another trader at Mohana Mandi.

YV Subba Reddy, Chairman, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD). (Photo credit: FB)

TIRUPATI: The annual contribution of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) to the AP government has been raised to Rs 50 crore from the earlier from Rs 2.5 crore, following the decision of the state government to bring in amendments to the AP Endowments Act .

TTD, the richest temple administration in the country, will now have to cough up the amount towards Common Good Fund (CGF), Endowments Administrative Fund (EAF) and Archaka Welfare Fund (AWF). The government sought the TTD to enhance its contribution under the three different heads through a memo, following which the trust board, under the chairmanship of YV Subba Reddy, accorded its approval to the proposal during the revision of the TTD’s budget estimates held on the sidelines of the trust board meeting on December 28.

According to sources, in 2012, the then endowments commissioner had asked the then TTD trust board to enhance the CGF and the EAF to Rs 15 crore and Rs 10 crore. The board had then passed a resolution to hike the contributions accordingly and forwarded the same to the government to modify the Act. But with the then united AP government failing to modify the Act, TTD continued to pay Rs 2.5 crore as the provision did not change.

However, the YSRC government has now decided to not only amend the Act but has also proposed to amend the earlier proposal which did not include a hike in the AWF from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 25 crore. The TTD’s contribution to the CGF has now been enhanced from Rs 1.25 crore to Rs 15 crore, EAF from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 10 crore and AWF from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 25 crore. The government has also proposed to seek Rs 16 crore towards salaries for archakas working with the endowments department.

Besides spiking up the TTD’s annual contributions, the government has also proposed to further hike the contributions by 10 per cent every five years.

Earlier, apart from the annual contribution of Rs 1.25 crore to CGF, TTD used to contribute Rs 16 crore annually towards ‘Dhoopa-Deepa Naivedyam’ scheme, for a total contribution of Rs 17.25 crore till now.

In addition to this, the government puts forward several requests to the TTD to provide financial assistance for upliftment of endowments temples and other temples across the state, which amount to an additional financial burden of approximately Rs 30 crore to Rs 50 crore annually.

It has been learnt that several members voiced concerns during the trust board meeting which approved the government’s proposal to hike TTD contributions. They also wanted the temple body to henceforth turn down undue requests for financial assistance to renovate/uplift other temples across the state.

MUMBAI: Post-demonetisation in 2016, the Indian Air Force flew 625 tonnes of new currency in 33 air sorties across the country to various destinations. This little-known aspect of demonetisation was revealed by former IAF chief B S Dhanoa while speaking at the IIT-B’s annual Techfest on Saturday.

Dhanoa mentioned this while highlighting some of the unknown roles of the IAF. He said the air force has risen to the occasion during natural disasters like floods and earthquakes. Dhanoa regretted that indigenisation has not fructified as much as one wished for. He said IAF has to depend upon 32 diverse platforms from nine different countries. At the same time, he said if the defence procurement procedure was politicised, “the whole system will become backward”. “Slowing down defence procurement will affect India,” Dhanoa said.

According to him, when the Balakot strike was approved, the government sent a political message to Pakistan that henceforth acts of terrorism will come with a heavy price.

“The Pulwama attack made the government change its strategy with regards to the response to terrorist attacks,” he told the huge gathering.

According to him, the IAF needs to modernise in order to provide a credible deterrence.

The IAF has identified 18 projects in the current financial year under the technology development fund.

NEW DELHI: A 60-year-old woman was killed while eight others, including six children, were injured as the first floor roof of their house collapsed on the ground floor in west Delhi’s Uttam Nagar on Saturday afternoon. Cops have detained the houseowner, Giridharilal, who is a retired security officer, and registered a criminal case against him.

Police said that the floor was made out of Kota stone and did not have a support under it. Giridharilal had erected a false ceiling at the ground floor, which increased the weight on the roof due to which it collapsed.

The fire department received a call at 3pm about a house collapse in Batasehay Wali Gali in Mohan Garden. “Three fire tenders were sent to the spot. The two-storey house was built in an area of 50 square yards. As the roof of the first floor collapsed, people got trapped under the debris. Nine persons were rescued and rushed to a hospital with the help of local residents,” said Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service.

The deceased was identified as Dulhari Devi (60). The injured included her brother Dharminder and his family who were visiting her for the weekend. Dulhari’s husband Vijay had taken the first floor, while his brother, Musafir, and his family were residing on the ground floor. Their paternal house was being reconstructed. Vijay, Musafir and his family members were out for work.

turning blind eye

Nagpur: Former mayor Pravin Datke on Saturday expressed anguish over lackadaisical attitude of the market department to provide information on the number of legal and illegal hoardings across the city. Already, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation is facing contempt petition in view of its failure to curb illegal hoardings across the city.

The civic administration had convened a meeting of hoarding committee where Datke is an invitee while additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi is a chairman.

The market department was supposed to present details of both legal and illegal hoardings across the city. The department was unable to submit action initiated against illegal hoardings defacing the city. Even it has failed to furnish details of legal hoardings across the city and Datke had been insisting the details for one year. Despite warnings, the department had no requisite details to present at the meeting.

Datke also convened two other meetings — preparing a policy to shift private travels out of the city limit and projects undertaken under built operate and transfer or private public partnership.

Regarding shifting of private travel operators out of the city limits, regional transport officer (Nagpur city) Dinkar Manwar, senior inspectors from traffic police zones — Jayesh Bhandarkar, Shailesh Sankhe among others attended the meeting along with Datke.

It was discussed that shifting of bus stops outside city may cause inconvenience to passengers. Hence the NMC will ensure that private travel bus stops which will shift outside the city limits should locate within 5km of the city.

Datke also pointed out that many private bus operators have approached him with suggestions of developing their own bus stops. After a healthy discussion for over an hour, Datke directed the civic administration to invite suggestions from the citizens over the issue. The NMC will start the process to invite suggestions from citizens and travel bus operators from January 6.

Meanwhile, mayor Sandip Joshi has formed another committee headed by senior BJP corporator Sanjay Bangale to ease rents of NMC owned market places.

NAGPUR: Nagpur University vice-chancellor SP Kane and pro-vice chancellor Vinayak Deshpande gave a hearing to a delegation of Save Merit Save Nation (SMSN) which met the duo after the Sanvaad elocution competition organized by SMSN, in association with TOI, was postponed.

The topic of the elocution competition is ‘Reservations in New India’. The decision to defer the competition was taken on Friday after opposition from a group of students under the aegis of an organization ‘The Platform’.

According to SMSN, the VC has decided to call a meeting of five office-bearers from both groups soon to “protect the constitutional right of all interested students irrespective of their opinion”.

The competition was to be first held at the Ambedkar College and then shifted to University Law College.

SMSN told the NU top brass that they are only against divisive vote bank politics leading to caste hatred. They are against excessive reservation and not Constitutional reservation, the delegation stated.

The SMSN delegation comprised president Sanjay Deshpande, secretary Anup Marar, vice-president Shreekrishna Buty, principal coordinator Brijesh Segan, Sanvaad convener Rashmi Shukla and Ganesh Iyer.

KOLKATA: The demolition of Tallah Bridge , which was scheduled to start on January 5, is not likely to commence before April. The state government will pull down the structure and the railways will play a supervisory role.Earlier, it was decided that railways would raze the road overbridge (ROB) portion — like it did for Majerhat bridge — and the state public works department (PWD) will take care of the approaches. Accordingly, PWD was looking at a January date. Railways would have started pulling down the ROB part a month later, after having invited bids for the demolition job. But after a meeting convened on Thursday by state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, where engineers from Eastern Railway (ER) and those from PWD discussed issues threadbare, a holistic outlook has been adopted.Post Thursday’s meeting, it has been decided that PWD will demolish the 57-year-old Tallah Bridge that has lost much of its load-bearing capacity and needs to be replaced immediately. The state agency is also implementing the ROB’s reconstruction. Therefore, a composite tender — for dismantling the existing ROB and rebuilding a new one — will be invited. “The procedure of calling an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) tender should be over by March. Therefore, work for pulling down the bridge can start by April,” a senior state official said. PWD is likely to start floating tenders by January 31.“If the same construction agency is asked to pull down the bridge and build the new one, we could do away with unnecessary red-tape. This way, the implementation will be speedier. Had the railways been given the job of dismantling the ROB and the PWD pulled down the approaches, a lot of permission and formalities would have had to be addressed. In case of Majerhat bridge (that fell on September 4, 2017), PWD had to approach ER for various issues during the demolition. When the same construction company builds the bridge, they would know how to go about with the demolition. Of course, the ROB will be razed under ER’s supervision,” said a state official.ER, in fact, has been shooting letters to PWD over the last one month for payment of the demolition cost. Railways had estimated the cost of pulling down the ROB portion at Rs 30.4 crore. ER was unable to award tender for demolition because the money wasn’t tranferred. “The railways had said it can start razing the ROB portion by January-end provided the cost is handed over immediately,” an official said.Now that there is a three-month breather, the temporary level crossing near the Lock Gate flyover can be set up to enable movement of heavy vehicles through the alternate road. ER has sent the proposal for Railway Board’s approval. PWD will also need demolition’s permission from the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS). Meanwhile, the state and central agencies have time to sort out other issues.The most crucial of them is the new ROB’s design. Railways has rejected PWD’s proposed bowstring design for the new Tallah Bridge, saying construction of multiple piers would jeopardize train movement. It has suggested a cable-stayed bridge instead. A cable-stayed bridge, railways has said, would require two spans supported by a single pier that could be built on the railway premises and train movement wouldn’t collapse completely.The chief secretary has formed a task force to thrash out the design issue.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73104596,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-627967,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-pushes-back-tallah-bridge-razing-sets-sights-on-april-date/articleshow/73102996.cms
279,['5/01/2020'],This ‘Pad Man’ bats for reusable pads,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Omkar Sathe

PUNE: Omkar Sathe appreciates Akshay Kumar-starrer “Pad Man” for propagating the use of sanitary pads and trying to remove the stigma around menstruation , but his organization, Allforasmile, takes a slightly different route to derive the same result.

The organization Sathe heads is staffed mainly by women. It manufactures low-cost and reusable cloth sanitary pads. Allforasmile started off as a skill-inculcating venture, aiming to train women in stitching as a means of earning a livelihood. Initially, manufacturing sanitary pads was a secondary project.

“We started in 2010 with stitching as the core skill area. Later, some people approached us because they wanted cotton pads. So, we started manufacturing cloth sanitary pads. The pads were circulated in select areas of the city, like Janwadi slums, during the trial run,” said Sathe, who would deliver a lecture about his venture as a part of the Kirloskar Vasundhara International Film Festival (KVIFF).

Women unable to afford commercially-made sanitary pads often use discarded cloth and thus, suffer from a variety of infections. However, Sathe said the manner in which cloth is used is often the line between hygiene and the lack of it.

“The pads that we sell and distribute are made entirely of cloth. They are reusable and can be used for years unlike synthetic pads that are very polluting to the soil and water. There are also many misconceptions about cloth pads, like the difficulty in washing them or the use of cloth being unhygienic. If the cloth pad is washed and dried properly, there is no risk,” he said, addressing a news conference about the venture.

Sathe also warned against the “trend” of schools and colleges setting up incinerators for used sanitary pads, claiming that many do not follow the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines.

“The WHO actually has a wide set of rules and guidelines, which must be followed while setting up such incinerators. It is clearly mentioned there that if the pads are incinerated at low temperatures, there is a huge risk of carcinogenic emissions. Most products in the market do not follow those regulations,” he said.

284,['5/01/2020'],A walk down history when India banked on Calcutta,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Diplomats and heritage enthusiasts at Samriddhi Bhavan on Saturday

By: Swarnali Dutta

KOLKATA: The original minutes of a meeting held on June 2, 1806, recording the establishment of the Bank of Calcutta, is preserved on the fifth floor of Samriddhi Bhavan, the regional headquarter of State Bank of India, on Strand Road. So are documents like registers and passbooks of scholar and politician Dadabhai Naoroji, scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose, India’s first President Rajendra Prasad and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore — all of them customers of the bank.

These and many more artefacts displayed at the State Bank archives and museum were showcased on Saturday morning to a group of heritage enthusiasts, including US consul general Patti Hoffman, Japanese consul Masayuki Taga and Thai consular official Nutt Svasthi and American Centre director Monica Shie. The group also visited the RBI Museum, a heritage and knowledge centre created by the Reserve Bank of India at the old RBI office on Council House Street in Dalhousie. The heritage museum walk was organised by Bespoke Art & Unique Legacies (BAUL) that promotes heritage.

The Bank of Calcutta, which was renamed Bank of Bengal on Janaury 2, 1809, was the first joint stock bank in the country and remained so till April 15, 1840, when Bank of Bombay was established. Bank of Madras opened for business still later, on July 1, 1843. The three banks were later merged to form the Imperial Bank of India in 1921, which was then nationalised and rechristened State Bank of India in 1955.

“The Bank of Calcutta issued the first legal tender or currency notes in India of denominations ranging between 10 and 10,000. However, only eight types of currency notes could be issued and be in circulation at a time. That remains even today with notes of Rs 5, Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 50, Rs 100, Rs 200, Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 denomination,” informed SBI chief manager (archivist) Ramakanta Hoom.

Among the bank’s illustrious borrowers were Prince Dwarkanath Tagore and Pandit Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar. While Tagore had first taken a loan of Rs 60,000 on July 21, 1817, and went on to take more loans at an interest of 9%, Vidyasagar had taken a loan of Rs 6,200 in 1873.

The bank had also maintained a complaint register from the very beginning. One of the complaints lodged by one Potit Pabun Mitra in 1889 against the rude behaviour by bank employee TWL Bruce finds mention. During the inquiry, Bruce denied recollection of the event and refused to apologise. But the inquiry concluded that the customer’s feelings had indeed been hurt and that Bruce must apologize.

The archive also has records of frauds. The biggest early fraud took place between 1826 and 1828 when Rajkissore Dutt, a petty businessman, took a loan of Rs 3.5 lakhs from the bank against forged company papers. These were later written off in the profit and loss account. But the first fraud was two years prior to it, when Rs 40,000 that had been advanced by the bank was repledged to it in 1824.

The RBI Museum situated next to the HSBC building offers fun and innovation beside history and knowledge. There is a replica of a gold vault where a gold bar weighing 12.5kg is displayed. There is an entire floor dedicated to games like Strike-N-Know, life-size Snake & Ladder, Spin the Wheel and Banking Ally to learn about prudent financial decisions, important financial terms, how to take financial decisions and basics of opening a bank account. The motive behind the games is to create awarenss about the banking system, explained museum curator Mahesh A Kalra. Other attractions include bioscope on how notes are printed and destroyed, kaleidoscope by using coins not in circulation any more.

Visakhapatnam: City-based functional strength trainer and cancer survivor Farzana Begum is on a mission to change perceptions about fitness. Farzana organises free strength training sessions in the city to motivate women to make fitness a part of their daily routine.

A certified functional trainer from TotalFit, USA and a nutritionist from GMSA Fitness, New Delhi, Farzana’s love for strength training started in 2017 after witnessing several women suffer from low bone density, low muscle mass and other health issues. Wanting to educate women about the importance of strength led her to become a certified trainer.

In late 2017, however, Farzana was diagnosed with a spinal tumour. After surgery, doctors informed her that another surgery was required after recovery as the tumour had moved to the chest. Another surgery later, Farzana started training women but in March 2019, underwent surgery again as the tumour had grown in size and eroded part of her ribcage. After her second surgery, Farzana was diagnosed with high-grade lymphoma.

But the 38-year-old found the strength to persevere against the disease. Speaking to STOI, Farzana said, “Like any other cancer patient, I lost my hair, eyebrows, looked pale, was extremely weak and had no strength at all. The treatment was stressful, but I had the support of my family and friends and was able to stay positive through most of it. What kept me going through the painful journey was my training sessions with my clients which gave me the courage to fight it and to have hope that I would get through it.”

It was during this time that Farzana made the decision to take fitness to women who could not afford training session. “I believe fitness is every woman’s right, no matter what her circumstances and also every woman’s duty to herself. The only way to create awareness is to make fitness available to every woman, hence I started free training sessions,” said the mother of two girls.

“My future plan is to have an all women’s gym that will cater to holistic health development,” added Farzana.

Sources said that Santosh Khamankar from Dhanora village had taken his cattle for grazing in compartment no. 137 under Kavilpeth beat of Virur range on Friday. A tiger lurking in the dense forest pounced at Khamankar and killed him on the spot.

One other fellow shepherd was eyewitness to the attack and he fled to the village leaving the cattle behind. He later returned with villagers and found Khamankar’s body in the jungle .

Sensing further trouble, principal chief conservator of forest ( wildlife ) on Saturday issued orders to capture the problem tiger following a request made by CCF the office.

As many as 23 people were killed in the district last year, including 20 killed by tigers, two by leopards and one other by an elephant .

SV Ramarao, CCF (Chandrapur), said that it is likely to be the same tiger from Rajura range that has already killed two persons and injured one other in the last 40 days. Forest officials have confirmed the identity of the male tiger responsible for two human kills with the help of camera trap and DNA samples sent to Center of Cellular Biology, Hyderabad.

“The proposal to capture the problem tiger has been already moved and PCCF have granted permission to do so. Instructions have been relayed to veterinary doctor and local staffers to constitute a team for capturing the problem tiger,” Ramarao told TOI.

MADURAI: Five people, who masqueraded as police officials, looted gold jewellery weighing 170 sovereigns and Rs 2.8 lakh in cash from the house of a civil contractor.

The incident that took place on December 27 last year came to light only on Saturday after the Koodal Pudur police registered a case based on the complaint from the contractor identified as Solai Gunasekaran.

Assistant commissioner of police, Tallakulam range, A Godwin Jagadeesh Kumar confirmed that they have registered a FIR and said that they have not got any clues so far to confirm the perpetrators involved.

Police sources said a five-member gang reached Gunasekaran’s house located in Appadurai Nagar near Koodal Pudur on December 27 and introduced themselves as a special police team.

Apart from Solai Gunasekaran, his wife and son were also present in the house.

Gunasekaran let them inside after the gang wanted to conduct a search in his house.

They conducted a thorough search throughout the house and as they did not find any suspicious things, they directed the family members to open bureaus.

When they resisted, one of the gang members took out a fire arm and threatened them with dire consequences.

They took all the gold jewels and cash found in the bureau and also took away a few documents found in the bureau.

While leaving, the gang took Gunasekaran with them in the car and left him at Othakadai. They then asked him to appear before local police station to get his valuables back and fled the spot.

After returning, he consulted with his relatives before lodging a formal complaint with the police. Higher police officers too conducted an inquiry.

The city police analyzed video footages from CCTV cameras available in the area seeking clues.

Visakhapatnam: An expert committee headed by Prof Balakrishnan on reforms in the education sector has recommended that the government convert Gurazada Apparao University in Vizianagaram and Andhra Kesari Tanguturi Prakasam University in Ongole in Prakasam district into specialised universities.

The expert committee has also suggested that one of the universities be converted into an open university and the other into an education administration university. The recommendations have been made keeping in mind the low gross enrolment ratio (GER) among students between the ages of 18 and 23 in Andhra Pradesh.

AP ranks 10th among all states in the recent all-India survey on higher education (AISHE), with a GER of 32 per cent. The recommendation of the committee to launch an open university and an education administration university was made keeping in mind the low GER and the absence of an open university in the state after bifurcation.

Further, the state lacks a university that exclusively offers courses that promote excellence in teachers’ education. The need for an institution offering courses to enhance administration and operational capacities of teachers to run academic institutions has grown with the increasing number of new schools and colleges in the state.

Speaking to STOI, an official from the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education (APSCHE) said that the state government will take a final call on converting one of the universities into a specialised university.

With the government considering the conversion of Gurazada Apparao University into a specialised varsity following the recommendation, “we expect a decision on the same in the next few weeks to make the universities operational from the next academic year,” said the official.

The state government had constituted Gurazada Apparao University by merging the Andhra University (AU) campus and the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU) campus in Vizianagaram. Academic activity is yet to start on the campus.

Meanwhile, employees of the AU Vizianagaram campus continue to operate from the Visakhapatnam campus.

Even before he could have utilised his engineering degree, he has cracked CAT. “I am pursuing my B. Tech degree in computer science and would like to pursue MBA in artificial science and data science. Both are connected and will make me more employable,” said Sawhney.

Aryan like others is worried about the economic slowdown in the country. He would like to create some economic models for better forecast of such a situation. “I believe with the advancement in the academics, the projections and data crunching will become much easier leading to the ways to pre-empt the slowdown situation,” said Swahney, who later would like to work towards bringing some policy decisions. He is eyeing a call from IIM-Ahmedabad.

Next to Sawhney is Nishant Agrawal who scored 99.91 percentile. He is pursuing final year civil engineering from MNIT. “Civil engineering has an element of human resource management. The technical skills of engineering added with financial and marketing skills will help me handling big construction projects like airports, townships and railways on my own,” said Agrawal.

Representative image

NAGPUR: Owners of the spa , which cops raided on Friday to bust a flesh trade den, were avoiding the police action by deploying several ‘tricks’.

Police officials had been keeping an eye on Zeedos Spa and Beauty Unisex Salon at Trimurti Nagar for more than a year. On Friday, social service branch (SSB) of crime branch rescued three women after raiding the place where flesh trade was allegedly going on under the garb of salon.

A couple, identified as Puja Nagdeve and Mithun Sarode, was arrested. They have been booked under sections of Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act.

It is learnt that the previous SSB team, which was dissolved following an ACB action, too had kept a watch on the salon. Senior PI of SSB Kishor Parvate said, “We had kept a close vigil on the spa after receiving a tipoff about the flesh trade. Raids couldn’t be conducted earlier as the spa owners were not allowing other people inside the salon. They were providing extra services to only specific customers.”

Police then sent a decoy as customer to the spa. But he was denied the extra service. So, cops kept sending him again and again until he gained trust of the accused who then agreed to provide the extra service.

On Friday, cops planned the raid by sending the fake customer. “The accused used to collect mobile phones of customers so we were not able to connect with our man inside. So, we decided to wait for some time and then raided the spot as it was necessary that we catch the accused red-handed,” said Parvate.

Madurai: Health department officials in Madurai on Saturday said that the health officials were constantly monitoring the clinics and hospitals to weed out any quacks in the region. The officials said that only two quacks were arrested in Madurai last year and that the situation was under control in Madurai district.

“Only three major raids were conducted last year, namely at Alanganallur, Thirumangalam and Peraiyur. Out of the three raids, only two quacks were arrested. There were complaints from Alanganallur that a person was administering injections at a pharmacy after which drug inspectors investigated,” said a source from the health department. The most recent case was the arrest of a 52-year-old quack in Peraiyur who was running a clinic in Saptur.

Local drug inspectors are also carrying out periodical checks on pharmacies in the district for possession of poor quality medicines, unlawful administration of abortion pills etc., based on complaints and tips, said an official from the office of the Assistant Director of Drugs Control, Madurai.

It has been widely reported that quacks are a major concern in Tamil Nadu and that the punishments in law are not severe enough to deter their growth. It was reported earlier this year that at least 1500 quacks have been booked in the state over the last 11 years.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Even as Delhi was witnessing severe cold days , students of many corporation schools were forced to brave the chill sitting on mats as there were no benches in their classrooms.

Despite making plans to procure benches from government’s e-portal or other sources last year, the three municipal corporations could not supply them to all schools for various reasons.

The issue rocked the house meeting of South Delhi Municipal Corporation on Saturday. Expressing resentment over no supply of benches in schools in his wards, Congress councillor from Ranhola Suresh Kumar questioned the mayor and commissioner about the reason for the delay and whether councillors’ fund could be used for the purpose.

“For three years we had been hearing about the supply of benches in primary schools. The civic officials should be ashamed of themselves for not being able to arrange for the benches,” said Kumar as he was joined by councillors from other political parties.

Officials said, supply of 7,000 benches was awaited in south corporation for Classes IV and V and 6,200 benches for Classes I and II. There was shortage of benches in nursery sections too. “We placed the work order four days ago and the shortage would be fulfilled in a couple of days,” said the official.

Situation is nowhere different in east corporation schools, which needed over 10,000 dual benches. “We had placed a demand for 10,260 dual benches on e-portal sometime back and recently got to know that Kendriya Bhandar had agreed to supply them as per our requirement. As soon as we get the samples verified, the process for delivering them to primary schools would start,” said a senior EDMC official. The civic agency pointed out that shortage of funds was one of the main reasons for the delay in the procurement process.

The north corporation, meanwhile, claimed to have fulfilled half of the requirement. “We required 12,000 benches and of them, 6,000 had been procured or supplied to the schools. At rest of the places, we either arranged for old benches donated by private schools and NGOs or ensured that the mats used for children were of good quality,” said north body’s standing committee chairman Jai Prakash.

297,['5/01/2020'],Depict Prithviraj as Gurjar king: Outfit to filmmakers,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Jaipur: The Akhil Bhartiya Veer Gujjar Mahasabha, a body of Gurjars, has issued a diktat to the makers of upcoming Bollywood film ‘Prithviraj’, based on 12th Century ruler Prithviraj Chauhan (1166-1192 CE) to project him as a Gurjar emperor instead of a Rajput king.

In a press conference held in Jaipur on Saturday, the body has claimed that Chauhan traced his origin to the Gurjar community while he was established as a Rajput king much later. Chauhan is known as a Rajput king from Chahmana dynasty.

In the film, Akshay Kumar is playing the role of Prithviraj, while Sanjay Dutt will be seen as Mohammed Ghori. The film is slated to release later in the year.

Acharya Virendra Vickram of ABVGM says that it is the right time in the history of last 900 years to claim the rightful origin of Prithviraj Chauhan.

“Piles of historical evidence in the different languages, including Persian, Jainism, Prakrit and Sanskrit suggest that Chauhan comes from a Gurjar clan,” said Vickram. The body said that oldest claim comes from Prithviraja Vijaya known to have authored by Jayanaka around 1191-92 CE.

“The book is a collection of poems in Sanskrit has keywords like Gurjar Mandala and Gurjar Durg which refers to the cultural identity of king which is none other than Prithviraj. It also has an account of the first battle of Tarain between Chauhan and Mohammed of Ghor. Also mentions about the Nandol fort which is known as Gurjaro fort,” said Jitesh Singh, member of the ABVGM.

The body also presented historical evidence from the epic Prithviraj Raso authored by Chand Bardai, Al Baruni’s (973-1050 CE) Tarikh Al Hind book, Mohammed Qasim Ferishta (1560-1620 CE) book Tarikh-e-Ferishta and 10th century poet Dhanpal.

“Our claim is based on history and those who have objection for the same can have a debate with us anywhere they want. I believe that history should be written in the light of the evidences which are still emerging,” said Vickram.

Why issuing diktat to film makers? The body responded that films are biggest source to create impression on the minds of people and they want them project the true characteristics of the warrior.

298,['5/01/2020'],"Prize money missing, NU cultural winners get empty envelopes","This story is from January 5, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur University (NU) has handed over empty envelopes to over 40 students who brought laurels to it at state, zonal, national and international levels by bagging top positions in cultural events like singing, dancing, elocution, and other sporting events in the last two academic years.

The teams were felicitated in August last year and given envelopes having bank forms instead of cheques towards prize money, ranging between Rs2,000 and Rs20,000 each. Besides, they have also been told that they will get only Rs3,000 irrespective of the event.

Authorities had told them to return the filled form for direct transfer of the amount as they have shifted to cashless and paperless system.

Till date, none of the athlete or the cultural team has received the prize money. The NU had honoured two batches in the same event in August 2019 and hence, the amount is said to be in lakhs.

Denying the charge, officials blamed the students for filling incorrect details.

Students Development director Abhay Mudgal said several students didn’t provide IFSC code or gave incorrect bank details. “We are fed up following up with students to provide complete information. When IFSC code comes, they will get the prize money in 8 days,” he said.

Mudgal said same is the case with earn and learn scheme and hostel students who face problems in receiving university grants and funds.

“In some cases, even the account number was not proper. We had even attempted NEFT transfer but it was returned,” Mudgal said.

He said only 8 to 10 students are facing problems while around 35 were felicitated from 2017-18 and 2018-19. “This money is given by the university and not from the organizers of the event where these students excelled,” he said.

“As per event, all are getting uniform prize money of Rs15,000. A notification has been issued in this regard,” he said.

The finance and accounts section will verify and process the forms of students who are stuck but there is no clarity when they will get money. Mudgal also ruled out cash payout when “students are unable to get it right”.

A student said if there are any students who don’t have banking knowledge, then teachers can assist them. “But we filled all details accurately. We are 100% sure. They are only giving excuses to delay payment. The forms were filled under the university’s supervision only,” students said.

Hyderabad: All-India Kisan Congress vice-president M Kodanda Reddy on Saturday said that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should take the initiative and convince the Centre to set up a turmeric board , a long-pending demand of farmers of Nizamabad district.

The AIKC vice-president charged the NDA government at the Centre and the TRS government in Telangana with dragging their feet on the issue. Urging the chief minister to write to the Narendra Modi government to announce a minimum support price (MSP) for turmeric, Reddy slammed the TRS government for neglecting the agriculture sector which needed to be encouraged to achieve better GDP.

KCR had also not fulfilled promises he had made to sugarcane farmers, Kodanda alleged. “The Nizam sugar factory has not been re-opened. The crop loan waiver scheme has not been implemented so far though KCR government has completed one year in office during its second term,” he said. “Even Rythu Bandhu scheme is not being implemented as 50 per cent of the over 50 lakh farmers in the state did not get money under the scheme,” Kodanda added.

HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has put his ministers’ and party legislators’ necks on the line in the event of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) not faring well in the January 22 municipal elections. Dropping enough hints that he would not hesitate to drop ministers if they fail to deliver the goods, the chief minister also told MLAs that they would not be considered for nominated posts.

The chief minister, who has decided not to campaign, however, wanted the ministers and legislators to go the whole hog to ensure the party’s victory in the polls. The TRS president also talked tough against groupism and indiscipline in the party. Making enquiries about the reported fight between minister Ch Malla Reddy and LB Nagar MLA D Sudheer Reddy at a public rally in Medchal the other day, the chief minister said: “I will not tolerate groupism and indiscipline that can impact the party’s performance in the elections.”

The chief minister also said that once the party declares the candidature in a ward, all the leaders and workers should strive for his or her victory. The party MLAs would be given the responsibility of selecting the candidates for ward member posts. Urging the ministers and MLAs to hold ‘aatmiya sammelanams’, KCR said that they will have to interact with important leaders and workers in their respective municipalities and municipal corporations.

“They should also meet the beneficiaries of government schemes and impress upon them to vote for TRS,” KCR said during the party’s extended executive meeting held at Telangana Bhavan on Saturday.

He is among 10 candidates, all from engineering or technology background, who was in the 100th percentile from across India. The topper from the state is believed to be a resident of Rangareddy district and is from the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai.While the number of aspirants from two states securing top score has remained low in last three years, academicians say many have still managed to secure a seat in the top IIMs (Indian Institute of Management ). “Hardly two candidates managed to secure highest percentile, but that doesn’t mean candidates did not get into top IIMs,” said Ramnath K, all-India CAT course director, TIME Institute.Among those in the 99.99 percentile bracket is Satwik Rao Kolluru from Hyderabad who is currently pursuing his final year in civil engineering at IIT-Mumbai.

Representational Image

BENGALURU: Missed calls from teachers to parents at 5am to wake up children for studies, students drawing rangolis to learn parts of a heart, special classes, reading rooms and monthly meetings for mothers — government schools across Karnataka are gearing up for the upcoming SSLC exams and using innovation to push up the pass percentage.

With district-wise rankings getting more competitive, various districts are taking special care not to leave any student behind. Last year, Hassan topped the list and then deputy commissioner Rohini Sindhuri was hailed for the turnaround in the district’s performance.

“Our preparations started as early as August. We’ve formed a special task force. A special assessment exam was conducted in August and 30% students were found to be weak. They have been categorised as ‘slow achievers’ to ensure they aren’t demotivated, and are clubbed in smaller classes. A special syllabus has been drafted for them and they’ve been given books,” said Fouzia Tarannum, CEO of Chikkaballapura zilla panchayat. The authorities also intend to take students to exam centres in March to give them a feel of the hall. The exams will begin on March 27.

In Bengaluru Rural district, students who scored less than 40% in mid-term exams are attending activity-based sessions influenced by the philosophy of renowned educationist John Dewey. Special worksheets have been prepared with corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds received from Bengaluru International Airport Limited.

In some districts, parents too are being involved in the process. “Teachers give missed calls to parents to wake up their children at 5am. In case guardians don’t turn up for parent-teacher meetings, teachers visit houses. We educate parents not to engage Class 10 children in other work. It’s important to take parents along,” Fouzia said.

In Hassan, special meetings are organised for mothers of SSLC students, where they are updated about their wards’ performance. In Mysuru district, students drop details of questions and problem areas in a box, and teachers hold classes on those topics for the entire batch.

In Mandya, there’s a special focus on boys as their pass percentage last year was 12% less than that of girls. “Boys get easily distracted with games, social media and TV. Girls are more motivated,” said K Yallakki Gowda, CEO, Mandya ZP. Thirty-two schools with a pass percentage of 40-60% have been allotted nodal officers who visit the institutions frequently to assess kids’ progress.

Raichur district, which was among the poorest performers last year, is conducting 48 tests in 12 weeks — one chapter per day. “This will not only make students familiar with questions but also help them overcome exam fear,” said Lakshmikanth Reddy G, CEO, Raichur ZP. In Hassan, 21,010 students are given take-home exams and open-book exams.

Teachers from Government High School, Pillangere village (on the outskirts of Shivamogga), are footing the electricity bills of SSLC students from poor families and buying them brighter bulbs.

-With Inputs from M Shrinivasa and Mahendra Kumar in Ballari

Boxes: Take a break from TV, parents told

Following feedback from students that the television-watching pattern of their parents is disturbing their preparations at home, education department authorities in Mysuru district have asked parents to take a break from TV when their children are at home and studying. The message has been communicated through parents meetings’ conducted at the school level.

Reading rooms in 225 Ballari schools

Reading rooms (odina mane) were set up in 225 Ballari schools on January 1 and are open from 6pm to 9pm every day. Bharathi Thimmareddy, president of Ballari ZP, said, “Most government school students are from lower-income groups and face problems like unaffordable power supply and disturbance caused by family members and neighbours. After talks with educationists, we set up these odina manes.”

No district-wise ranking?

Suresh Kumar S, minister for primary and secondary education minister, said the government is considering scraping the district-wise ranking announcement. “We want qualitative and not quantitative results. How students cleared the SSLC examination is equally important, not just the number of students who cleared it. So, we don’t want to declare district-wise ranking based on pass percentage. A final decision will be taken in a day or two,” he said.

The government completed reservations for 385 corporators in 10 municipal corporations and 2,727 ward councillors in 120 municipalities along with the voters’ list on Saturday. Reservations for chairperson posts in urban local bodies will be completed by Sunday. Government has sent list of voters and number of wards reserved for each category to district collectors and municipal commissioners. Officials said reservations were finalised taking the Census 2011 population figures into consideration.

While 50% of wards had been reserved for women, some wards for SCs and BCs. At least one seat has been earmarked for STs where the ST population is less than 1 per cent. For instance, in Karimnagar Municipal Corporation, of total 60 wards, one seat was reserved for an ST, six for SCs, 23 wards for BCs and 16 for women. Fourteen wards are unreserved which means any category candidate can contest. Since the reservation process is over, the State Election Commission (SEC) will announce the list of wards that were reserved for each category on Sunday and issue the poll notification on January 7.

Dharmana was made an accused in the Vanpic charge sheet of quid pro quo case filed by CBI against AP’s current chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy.As the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act make it mandatory for the CBI to obtain sanction from the state government to prosecute a public servant like a cabinet minister, CBI had applied to Andhra Pradesh in 2013 seeking permission to prosecute the minister. The state government did not accord sanction.As a result, the CBI court refused to take into cognisance the role of Dharmana in the case. However, when Dharmana stepped down, the CBI filed another memo before the trial court urging it to take cognisance as he was no more a public servant.The trial court then took into cognisance the role played by the then revenue minister in the huge land allotments made in Vanpic episode. Aggrieved by this, Dharmana had approached the high court challenging the trial court’s decision.Finding force in the argument of Dharmana, the high court earlier set aside the cognisance order.Aggrieved, the CBI challenged the HC order in the Supreme Court. It was the status of this case, the CBI court now wants to know.",amaravati,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73107062,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-69652,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/cbi-courts-seeks-status-of-case-against-ex-ap-minister/articleshow/73103576.cms

HYDERABAD: Days after arresting Omni Medi owner K Srihari Babu and a pharma company representative, the Anti-Corruption Bureau on Saturday arrested one more person in the multi-crore Insurance Medical Services ( IMS ) scam . So far, 24 persons have been arrested in the scam.

Cherukuri Nagaraju, 47, marketing manager with Omni Medi, was taken into custody and booked for criminal conspiracy and relevant sections of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. According to ACB , Nagaraju colluded with government officials and others and lured public servants to get the bills cleared in a dubious manner.

Nagaraju allegedly obtained purchase orders and got the bills cleared for Omni Medi and Legend Enterprises. Sources said Nagaraju worked for both Omni Medi and Legend Enterprises. It may be recalled Srihari, former IMS director Ch Devika Rani and former joint director K Padma played a key role in obtaining purchase orders for Legend Enterprises.

ACB arrested Srihari and Sweden-based pharma company HemoCue’s regional manager T Venkatesh on January 1. Venkatesh allegedly issued a fake authorisation letter indicating that Legend was the authorised distributor of HemoCue’s products in Telangana.

BENGALURU: Missed calls from teachers to parents at 5am to wake up children for studies, students drawing rangolis to learn parts of a heart, special classes, reading rooms and monthly meetings for mothers — government schools across Karnataka are gearing up for the upcoming SSLC exams and using innovation to push up the pass percentage.

With district-wise rankings getting more competitive, various districts are taking special care not to leave any student behind. Last year, Hassan topped the list and then deputy commissioner Rohini Sindhuri was hailed for the turnaround in the district’s performance.

“Our preparations started as early as August. We’ve formed a special task force. A special assessment exam was conducted in August and 30% students were found to be weak. They have been categorised as ‘slow achievers’ to ensure they aren’t demotivated, and are clubbed in smaller classes. A special syllabus has been drafted for them and they’ve been given books,” said Fouzia Tarannum, CEO of Chikkaballapura zilla panchayat. The authorities also intend to take students to exam centres in March to give them a feel of the hall. The exams will begin on March 27.

In Bengaluru Rural district, students who scored less than 40% in mid-term exams are attending activity-based sessions influenced by the philosophy of renowned educationist John Dewey. Special worksheets have been prepared with corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds received from Bengaluru International Airport Limited.

In some districts, parents too are being involved in the process. “Teachers give missed calls to parents to wake up their children at 5am. In case guardians don’t turn up for parent-teacher meetings, teachers visit houses. We educate parents not to engage Class 10 children in other work. It’s important to take parents along,” Fouzia said.

In Hassan, special meetings are organised for mothers of SSLC students, where they are updated about their wards’ performance. In Mysuru district, students drop details of questions and problem areas in a box, and teachers hold classes on those topics for the entire batch.

In Mandya, there’s a special focus on boys as their pass percentage last year was 12% less than that of girls. “Boys get easily distracted with games, social media and TV. Girls are more motivated,” said K Yallakki Gowda, CEO, Mandya ZP. Thirty-two schools with a pass percentage of 40-60% have been allotted nodal officers who visit the institutions frequently to assess kids’ progress.

Raichur district, which was among the poorest performers last year, is conducting 48 tests in 12 weeks — one chapter per day. “This will not only make students familiar with questions but also help them overcome exam fear,” said Lakshmikanth Reddy G, CEO, Raichur ZP. In Hassan, 21,010 students are given take-home exams and open-book exams.

Teachers from Government High School, Pillangere village (on the outskirts of Shivamogga), are footing the electricity bills of SSLC students from poor families and buying them brighter bulbs.

Boxes: Take a break from TV, parents told

Following feedback from students that the television-watching pattern of their parents is disturbing their preparations at home, education department authorities in Mysuru district have asked parents to take a break from TV when their children are at home and studying. The message has been communicated through parents meetings’ conducted at the school level.

Reading rooms in 225 Ballari schools

Reading rooms (odina mane) were set up in 225 Ballari schools on January 1 and are open from 6pm to 9pm every day. Bharathi Thimmareddy, president of Ballari ZP, said, “Most government school students are from lower-income groups and face problems like unaffordable power supply and disturbance caused by family members and neighbours. After talks with educationists, we set up these odina manes.”

No district-wise ranking?

Suresh Kumar S, minister for primary and secondary education minister, said the government is considering scraping the district-wise ranking announcement. “We want qualitative and not quantitative results. How students cleared the SSLC examination is equally important, not just the number of students who cleared it. So, we don’t want to declare district-wise ranking based on pass percentage. A final decision will be taken in a day or two,” he said.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: An advocate, whose letter played a key role in ridding Yadadri of its infamous child trafficking and prostitution tag, has now set his eyes on tracing the missing children in Telangana. He stated that had police not closed missing cases and carried out proper investigation, Hajipur killings could have been averted.

Advocate Rapolu Bhaskar, whose letter on the woes of children caught in the clutches of trafficking mafia moved the high court, has now filed a public interest litigation (PIL) on the missing children. The high court had converted his letter into a PIL and ordered crackdown and freed Yadadri from the menace.

In his latest PIL, the advocate mentioned about the cases of missing children in Telangana. “Between 2015 and 2018, 2,000 children—1,350 girls and 650 boys — went missing. What is alarming is the fact that police are closing these cases without tracing the children,” he stated in his petition.

“Children are being kidnapped by mafia elements and are trafficked. Girls are being forced into prostitution,” he said. “The menace is more prevalent in Adilabad district, where the kidnapped children are being trafficked out to other states. Telangana has the dubious distinction of being at eighth place in the country in trafficking girls,” he said.

Most missing children belong to socially and economically weak sections. Police were not filing charge sheets in all the cases of missing children, he alleged.

Bhaskar urged the court to direct the director-general of police (DGP) and home secretary to reopen all the closed cases pertaining to missing children. “This would unearth the real criminals playing with the lives of children in particular and people in general,” he said.

He cited the Hazipur killings as an example where the rape and murder of three minor girls came to the fore long after the police closed these cases. “Had police investigated the cases properly, then the crimes would have been averted,” he said.

Coimbatore: As many as 90 members and representatives of Communist Party of India (CPI) and Communist Party of India (Marxist), including CPM’s member of Parliament from Coimbatore P R Natarajan, were detained on Saturday evening for holding a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and other policies of the Centre. Nine of the detained people were women.

The Left parties had called for the protest a week ago and had sought police permission. But the permission was denied on Friday.

The members, however, held the protest at 5pm on Saturday near the powerhouse on Sivananda Colony in the city. Police detained them and kept them at a private marriage hall nearby.

The protesters also voiced their support to the nation-wide strike on January 8, which, they said, has been called to condemn the Centre’s economic policies and the moves that would lead to the privatisation of public sector units. They called for the Centre to repeal CAA and also condemned police attacks on public, who have been protesting against it. TNN

Dehradun: Environmentalists from across the country have started gathering in Haridwar to support a woman seer from Bihar, Brahmacharini Padmavati who has been on a fast unto death since past 21 days against what she terms as the government’s apathy towards river Ganga. The seer has been among those who took up fasting for a clean and free-flowing Ganga after the death of IIT professor-turned seer GD Agrawal who had been fasting for the issue before he passed away in October 2018.

Agrawal’s major demands were stopping all four major dam projects on Ganga and its tributaries, stopping mining and stone crusher works on Ganga and its tributaries, ensuring standard e-flow in the river after scientific consultation from experts and implementing a Ganga Act to save the 2,525km-long river. Environmentalists say that none of these demands have been acted upon by the government despite Agrawal laying down his life for the cause.

“India has a tradition of respecting neer, naari, jal (water, women and river) but nobody seems to be bothered that a woman for the first time in history has been sitting on a protest fast to save a river. It is shameful for all of us. We urge the government to take cognisance and help Padmavati break her fast and show the world that this government really cares for the water system of the country and respects women,” said veteran water conservationist Rajendra Singh who reached Haridwar on Saturday to support Padmavati’s cause.

He added that in Padmavati’s support, a two-day national conclave on ‘Ganga Ecology Conservation’ is being organised at Matri Sadan, the ashram where the seer has been sitting on a peaceful protest. “The conclave will focus on bringing change in the policy to safeguard our country’s largest water system – Ganga. It is a sad reflection of the way the system has become that seers have to sit on protest in order to safeguard a river,” Singh said.

Meanwhile, Swami Shivanand Saraswati, head of Matri Sadan, blamed the state government for paying no attention to the Ganga, “Chief minister of Uttarakhand recently said Ganga is pure. If it is so, then why do they drink bottled water even at functions held at Haridwar? They should save money of exchequer and consume Ganga water when visiting Haridwar. This government is simply focussed on minting money through Ganga, and least bothered about the river.”

JAIPUR: In an embarrassing development for the Ashok Gehlot-led Rajasthan government, state Congress chief and deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Saturday slammed its handling of the infant deaths in Kota’s JK Lon Hospital and demanded accountability. As many as 107 infants have died in the hospital in the past 35 days.After paying a visit to the Kota hospital, Pilot said the state government could not escape responsibility by pointing fingers at the previous government as “this is not a small incident, but a heart-wrenching one”.“I think our response to the entire episode could have been more sensitive and more compassionate. After 13 months in government, it may not serve any purpose (for us) to keep pointing towards the previous government’s wrongdoings or misdeeds,” Pilot said.He said, “As many as 107 children have died. It is not stopping. I have met some of the bereaved family members. I have no words to express their grief and hurt. The poor strata of society depends on government hospitals. Rolling out statistics will not do any good. We must infuse confidence in people that this kind of incident will not occur again. That is the demand of the people as well.”The deputy chief minister said the people voted out the previous government for its failures and blaming it will not absolve the present government of its responsibility. “We have been voted in. We have to take responsibility and face consequences. People expected us to deliver.”Asking for fixing accountability at all levels, Pilot said: “While expecting others to be accountable, we have to be accountable to ourselves first.

318,['5/01/2020'],A Class(es) Apart,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Within four decades, Nagpur has metamorphosed from being a town dotted with small tuition classrooms into an established education hub with an estimated annual turnover of Rs100 crore. It was somewhere in the late 1970s, that the ‘tuition class’ trend started taking shape in Nagpur though still carrying a taboo of sorts as it was perceived to be only for academically weak school/junior college students. 40 years later, Nagpur now boasts of numerous coaching institutes which witness a staggering 20,000 enrolment each year in tailor-made course modules that prepare the kids for medical and engineering competitive exams.

Ejaz Inamdar started his math and science tuition class in the second half of 1980 with batches starting from right from 5am to accommodate the high student demand. “In those days, I never got a student who would score 80% or more in school because tuitions were considered to be something that only weak students enrolled for,” recalls Inamdar, who also broke the stereotype image of tuition teachers.

Always dressed in classy attire, designer glasses and riding an uber-cool bike, in the 1980s Inamdar was known as much for his unique teaching style as he was for his chocolate hero looks. This unintentional brand building helped, in some ways, to create an aura around tuition classes.

From individual stars like Inamdar, Nagpur saw a rise in integrated tuitions where more than one teacher taught. Panini Telang, founder of Pioneer Study Centre, said, “I believe the first organized tuition institute in Nagpur was Jayant Tutorials somewhere around 1982. It probably was the first known experiment where a group of teachers got together and started an institute.”

While this may have been the first attempt to make such multi-teacher classes commercially viable, earlier too multi-teacher set up existed as social projects. Around 1975, veteran academician Vijay Swami was involved in one such attempt to tutor underprivileged kids. “Tribal students or those coming from marginalized sections were taught by almost three to four of us. It was a completely charitable exercise,” said Swami.

The 80s and 90s firmly established the tuition class culture in Nagpur with students hopping to more than one class for math, biology etc. By the time the 90s ended, tuitions had become a need. Ranjnikanth Bondre, founder of Sneha Classes, said, “By 1997 or ’98 it was clear that every parent wanted their child to be enrolled in a tuition class. Competition had increased and it was natural for parents to want the best for their kids. Tuitions gave their kids an edge, and edge that made all the difference in the crucial board exams.”

As the 90s staggered to an end, Nagpur had an extremely well established tuition class culture with both single and multi-teacher set ups thriving. And this established culture meant that Nagpur was ready for the watershed moment that was coming in 2003. This was the year, when competitive exams came into play for admissions to medical and engineering colleges.

Sarang Upganlawar, founder of ICAD Institute, said, “That year was a turning point not only for the coaching industry but also for society. Before this only rote study was in vogue as board exam marks were the benchmark and then students would struggle when they enrolled for professional courses. But with competitive exams, the students started learning analytical skills and worked their brains to full capacity. Competitive exams have provided a stimulus to the brain.”

He added that now students from Nagpur are working in top first like Microsoft, IBM, Facebook, PWC etc with their first package itself starting from Rs25 lakh.

Though high quality and results producing local institutes had already taken roots in the city, this did not prevent national level players to step in. Allen Institute has been aggressively expanding its presence in Nagpur, even though it has been a relatively late entrant into the local market. Ashutosh Hisaria, the Nagpur centre head of Allen Institute, said, “The feasibility study of any city and its potential is done by our expert team, and based on that we take a decision on moving in or not. But if there are so many existing coaching institutes in a city, then it means there is a strong demand as well.”

Every coaching institute’s success lies in its faculty which produce results.

Tanjit Chhabra, business development head of, Resonance said, “It is a pure numbers game with demand-supply equation coming to the fore. In this industry, the faculty which has a higher strike rate (of students qualifying) is obviously more in demand. Every year faculty upskilling initiatives are also held in Kota to make sure everyone is up to date with the paper pattern.”

In Nagpur, monthly salary for teachers range between Rs25,000 to Rs5 lakh. It all depends on the seniority, performance of teachers. It is common for institutes to have a group of core and supplementary teachers. Core teachers are the subject experts while supplementary team clarifies smaller doubts in any subject or even the paper pattern.

In the over 15 years of its existence, coaching institutes in Nagpur have evolved to provide additional facilities. Narendra Wankhede, director of Wankhede Madam’s Academy, said, “Now a coaching institute has a well stocked library, a reading room and even a dining hall. Many institutes provide tiffin facilities for students as well. All this is done to save time for students that would otherwise be wasted in commuting.”

The coaching industry in Nagpur has also boosted its ancillary economy. Real estate rentals are thriving wherever coaching institutes are set up because they are considered ‘non-nuisance’ tenants. School vans and mini buses, that were idle post school hours have tapped into a booming business of transporting kids from home-to-institute, whereas road side food vendors are thriving in their vicinity. No wonder it is said, that Nagpur’s economy is run because of education.

Madurai: Demanding the ban on toddy to be lifted, the Federation of Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Association will hold a state-wide protest on January 21.Speaking at a press meet, C Nallasami, coordinator of the association, said that the state government has unfairly banned toddy for over 30 years now. Toddy is a white-coloured alcoholic beverage prepared by fermenting sugar sap extracted from palm trees and contains around 4-5% alcohol. It was banned in 1987 in Tamil Nadu.

“We have been challenging the government, public and activists to convince us that toddy is only harmful for health and have offered Rs 10 crore as prize money. However, till now, no one has come forward. Clearly, there is only unfair discrimination because other liquor with higher alcoholic content is not banned,” said Nallasami.“The state-wide protest will be held under the banner ‘Tamil Nadu Toddy Movement’ . We want to spread the message that toddy is like food and medicine, not the same as intoxicating, addictive drugs and liquor. Even Periyar supported the sale of toddy,” they said. tnn

322,['5/01/2020'],Chennai: Basin Bridge turns one-way for now,"This story is from January 5, 2020

The closure of the Elephant Gate flyover had caused traffic snarls on Basin Bridge

CHENNAI: The traffic police have made Basin Bridge one-way on a temporary basis to ease flow of vehicles which used to line up for at least a kilometre on all sides, choking movement.

They have prevented vehicles from making a right turn at Basin Bridge flyover and proceed towards Choolai and Pulianthope.

Instead, the vehicles coming from Vyasarpadi flyover have been directed to travel further on Basin Bridge and proceed upto Mint flyover where they will have to make an U-turn to travel back on a parallel road through Padmanabha theatre and then climb Basin Bridge flyover to proceed towards Choolai or Pulianthope.

Motorists also cannot proceed on Wall Tax Road to reach Choolai, Pulianthope or Vepery, since the Elephant Gate flyover is under construction, though it will soon be thrown open. A senior police officer said, “We have made the arrangements on a trial basis to check viability.”

Police said the motorists have to travel an additional 2.5 km to proceed towards Choolai or Pulianthope. As the stretch – Basin Bridge – connects Grand North Trunk (GNT) Road with one of the city’s premier medical institutions — Government Stanley Hospital — ‘108’ ambulance drivers had often complained of vehicular pile-up at the bridge, forcing them to lose the ‘golden hour’ for those injured in accidents.

The traffic police also plan to add another one-way route to ease the flow on Basin Bridge flyover. The vehicles from Choolai and Pulianthope will be allowed to proceed towards Vyasarpadi and make an ‘U’ turn under Vyasarpadi flyover and proceed towards Basin Bridge flyover and further on to Mint.

They are also working on detailed plans to end the traffic snarls choking Basin Bridge. “Many people who reside in RK Nagar, Tondiarpet, Korukkupet, Washermenpet and Manali prefer to use the Vyasarpadi stretch to take Basin Bridge to reach MGR Central in less than 30 minutes. It earlier took more than two hours to reach these places,” said a police officer.

According to police data, at least 50–60 vehicles pass through Basin Bridge flyover every minute during the peak hours. Police said they were re-routing ambulances on the one-way stretch to reach Basin Bridge flyover, especially during peak hours, to avoid snarls.

NEW DELHI: Ashram Chowk has reached breaking point after traffic was diverted with the closure of the Kalindi Kunj road due to anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters occupying it. But the Barapullah elevated road has also suffered collateral damage, with an increasing number of affected vehicles using it. This is compounded by a bottleneck formed at the DND Flyway entry near Sarai Kale Khan. The situation is so bad at peak hours that cops are forced to stop vehicles at the DND loops leading to the elevated segment.

With the Kalindi Kunj road blocked by police, vehicles going to Noida from south Delhi use Mathura Road to access the DND flyway, but many try to avoid the exasperating jams at Ashram caused by the construction of the underpass and the increased volume of traffic by taking the Barapullah-DND route.

According to a police estimate, around 30,000 vehicles are plying on the Barapullah stretch these days, nearly double the number that the elevated road can accommodate. The snarl at the DND intersection adds to the overall chaos.

Some of the harassed commuters claimed that even normal drive time on the Barapullah length, usually 45 minutes at most, has now increased by up to an hour and a half due to the congestion. Apart from cars, over a thousand commercial vehicles going from south Delhi to east Delhi or Noida have also been using the route to avoid Ashram. Though the traffic police has been directing them to alternative passages, including the Noida Link Road, they somehow contrive to use the shorter elevated road.

Police officers warned that the snarls are expected to linger on until the Kalindi Kunj road is opened to traffic again. However, they also added that the jams are not likely to fully end so long as the extension of the elevated road to Mayur Vihar is not completed. There is construction work going on, resulting in the three-lane road getting constricted near Sarai Kale Khan. The road takes a loop towards the DND connector here and vehicles tend to slow down, creating a tailback that can stretch back to even Kidwai Nagar during the rush hours.

A similar situation is reported during the morning hours when a huge volume of traffic from Noida travels towards south Delhi using the same facility. “We have to deploy personnel on the elevated road, which was designed to provide a seamless flow of traffic, to manage the situation caused by traffic from the DND loop merging there,” said a traffic police officer.

The cops will conduct a study of the traffic volume on the stretch and might ban the entry of small commercial vehicles to alleviate the pain of commuters. Police may also halt traffic on Ring Road periodically to allow vehicles from the Barapullah road to access the DND loop and thus undo the traffic knot clear on the elevated road

Coimbatore: Education is a process of refinement and the best investment a country can bestow on its youth, Justice P Sathasivam , former Chief Justice of India and former governor of Kerala, said here on Saturday .

“Universities should help bring a social revolution by contributing batches of scientists, technicians, engineers, agriculturists and others, who would change the economic character of the society,” he said while speaking at an event held at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) to present the lifetime achievement award to former vice-chancellor of Anna University E Balagurusamy.

Coimbatore: A huge crowd of men , women and children watched in awe as the waves of a turquoise Kurichi lake gently rocked six sailboats, a kayak and a rowing boat.

The two-day Royal Boat Show, which began on Saturday as part of the 12th edition of the annual Coimbatore Vizha (Coimbatore Festival), will create awareness on rainwater harvesting and preservation of water bodies, said B Praveen Kumar, chairman of Young Indians (YI), which is organizing the event in association with the Indian Navy and the Royal Madras Yacht Club (RMYC).

Commanding officer of INS Agrani Ashok Rai along with social activist SP Anbarasu inaugurated the show.

The boats were brought from the Southern Naval Command in Kochi, Kumar said. “A team comprising of 14 Navy personnel and RMYC members are rowing the boats. The boats neither pollute the lake nor make noise,” TOI. “We have also deployed a motorized rescue boat to handle any untoward incident.”

“Coimbatore Vizha is not just about celebrations but also about creating a platform for new ventures. As of now, no boating activity is carried out in the city. By laying a foundation as part of the vizha, we are planning to create an ecosystem where sailing can be taken up as a sport for the younger generation,” Kumar said.

YI is planning to conduct a regatta, which will have a series of boat or yacht races, as a part of the vizha next year, the official said. “We are also conducting talks with the city corporation, Indian Navy and various government departments on starting a boat club as a part of the lake beautification project.”

The only thing that connects the city with boating is the non-functioning boat house at Singanallur lake, said Dharmalingam, a resident of Veerakeralam. “It is the first time a boat show is being organized in the city. As there are not many recreational spaces, the event attracted several people, especially children. But, as the details of the event were not publicized properly, we could not reach here on time,” he said.

The boat show is on from 10:30am to 12:30pm and again from 3pm to 5pm.

Rachna Bhola, a postgraduate in psychology counselling as well as English literature, conducts dermatoglyphics multiple intelligence tests (DMIT) and workshops on stress and anger management. While pursuing her post-graduation, the teacher-turned-counsellor completed a project on ‘Depression and stress among urban victimized adolescence’. Rachna had to shift to Chandrapur from Delhi after her husband, a senior government official, was transferred.

In a chat with TOI, she spoke about her plans to starts workshops on stress and anger management in Vidarbha.

Excerpts from the interview...

Q. How would describe anger as an emotional outburst?

A. Anger is one of the most powerful and vital emotions. It’s a reaction to frustration and maltreatment. It’s an ‘umbrella emotion’, covering numerous feelings like rejection, hurt, embarrassment, fear and insecurity. Anger styles are predominantly learnt from early childhood but can also be caused by mood disorders such as depression or other genetic inheritances. It is a negative, internal feeling associated with specific cognitive and perceptual distortions. In angry people there are several deficiencies like mis-appraisals, errors, attributions of blame, injustice, preventability, intentionality, subjective labelling and physiological changes.

Q. What are the ills and evils of anger?

A. People who explode with anger are at a great risk of getting a stroke. Anger ruins relationships. When anger turns to aggression or violence, the evil effects are more severe. Study shows that one-third of couples experience at least one incident of domestic violence due to anger. The effect on children witnessing conflict at home can be devastating. Anger also affects productivity at the workplace.

Q. Are anger and stress linked?

A. There is more anger in the world today than 20 years ago. It is evident in workplace violence, road rage, school shoot-outs, etc. Stress can increase certain problems and if you experience anger often, chances are, stress will make it worse. Healthy stress is good when it is controlled and does not lead to irritability. One must learn to identify unhelpful or negative thought patterns and change inaccurate beliefs.

Q. In what way is violence related to anger?

A. Crime is a result of emotional strain in one’s life. Strain is a result of losing something valuable such as a career or marriage or failing to achieve financial or academic goals. Strained relationships also lead to anger. According to a research, negative emotions take the form of anger. They lead to crime, including violence, within the four walls of the house or outside it. Domestic violence and road rage are the two most common fallouts of anger.

Q. Is anger playing a role in the rising number of suicide cases?

A. The suicide rate of adolescents has increased. Some adolescents have difficulty regulating their behaviour in the face of anger and emotion associated with suicidal behaviour. Suicide is the third leading cause of deaths in 15 to 19-year-olds. Physical, emotional and social changes, including poverty, abuse, violence, can make adolescents vulnerable to mental health problems. Anger and the expression of anger is associated with suicidal behaviour.

Q. Has anger increased violence against women?

A. Driven by anger, men tend to become violent. Lack of education, a history of child maltreatment, exposure to domestic violence against their mothers, alcohol, unequal gender norms and a sense of entitlement over women are the main reasons. Women are more likely to experience intimate partner violence. They need to be educated and more socially aware about their rights in order to handle a man’s aggression and anger.

Q. Has anger become one of the most damaging aspects of today’s society in the context of personal relationships or social behaviour?

A. When anger is not handled properly in a relationship, it can cause irreparable damage. If people learn to understand and share the underlying drivers of their anger, it will go a long way in saving relationships. Some partners do respond positively by listening and caring.

Q. Do you feel the rise in the number of divorce cases, marital disputes and family problems have risen due to anger?

A. Angry exchanges are bound to happen between intimate partners. Anger is identified as the most powerful emotion expressed in relational conflict and may escalate quickly. If not corrected, the fallout could be separations or irreparable rifts. Anger has certainly increased divorce cases and disputes. Timely intervention and counselling can save marriages and families.

Q. Do you feel anger has damaged many interpersonal relationships?

A. Correlation analysis revealed that there is a negative relationship between anger and interpersonal relations. Anger elicits stronger paralinguistic changes in a person’s voice. People communicate anger through facial or postural gestures. We need to listen before we speak. In this manner, we can assess the situation logically. Don’t assume that you ‘know’ how others feel or why they made certain choices. Focus solely on the issue as it makes you more objective. Respond assertively and not aggressively. Avoid over-generalization. Keep words like ‘“always,” “never” or “everyone” out of discussions. For example, instead of saying “everyone takes advantage of me” and getting worked up, you can instead say “I can’t do this for you over the weekend. I already have plans”.

Q. Do you feel there is anger behind every ‘danger’?

A. Anger is initially elicited by a perception of a threat to one’s physical well-being, property, present or future resources, self-image, social status or projected image to one’s group, maintenance of social rules that regulate daily life or comfort. It may persist even after the threat has passed. Anger motivates a response of antagonism to thwart, drive off, retaliate against or attack the source of the perceived threat. By controlling your physical responses, you can diffuse a tense situation because you are better able to calm down and reframe the situation mentally.

Q. How can one control anger?

A. Through anger management techniques, anger can be reduced. Reconstruction of focus and thinking style can help. Provocation and impulsive reactions can be controlled through breathing techniques, in-depth muscular relaxation and imagination. Learning behavioural coping to manage provocative situations in a constructive manner can help to solve problems.

Q. What must one do to quell one’s anger?

A. One must use stress management techniques before it turns into anger or aggression or aggravation. Lack of empathy leads to poor communication skills and failure to understand others. It’s all about learning to recognize and modify self-talk or inner conversation. Learning to effectively communicate without getting hostile, adjusting expectations and learning the process of forgiveness are steps towards anger control.

JODHPUR: Amid the chaos over the deaths of infants at Kota’s J K Lon Hospital, disturbing figures of similar deaths have emerged from Jodhpur .

A joint report on infant deaths at Umaid Hospital and MDM Hospital in Jodhpur, prepared by the hospitals’ governing organisation, states that a total of 146 deaths (of children) were recorded at the Neo Natal Care and Paediatric ICUs in December.

As per figures obtained from S N Medical College, the governing organisation, a total of 4,689 children were admitted to the two hospitals in December. Of these, 3,002 were infants. During treatment, 146 children, including 102 infants, died.

SN Medical College principal S S Rathore said the child mortality rate came to 3%, which was in keeping with international infant mortality rates.

As per the figures, 47,815 children had been admitted to the hospital in 2019, of which 754 children died, which is 1.57%. But, of these, 5,634 children were admitted to the Neo NICU and ICU in serious condition and all 754 deaths were reported in the NICU and ICU.

Rathore said the paediatric care units for critical patients had been winning first prize for the past 2 years in succession and this was because “we are doing the best”.

He added that the hospital here has to bear the load of patients from entire western Rajasthan and children are also referred to this hospital from hospitals like AIIMS.

While calculating the mortality rate, the hospital administration calculated it factoring in patients admitted to the paediatric wards while the deaths occurred in the NICU and ICU.

Though Rathore denied any shortage of resources to deal with the “pressure”, many senior doctors from the hospital’s paediatric department have been running their own private hospitals and skipping hospital duties. Recently notices had been served on these doctors, including those who had medical shops at their residences, but the situation has not shown any improvement and the absence of senior doctors from the OPD remains a matter of concern.

338,['5/01/2020'],Seeranaickenpalayam bridge is now open for motorists,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Coimbatore: Much to the relief of motorists, Seeranaickenpalayam bridge that was closed for renovation seven months ago was opened for traffic on Saturday. Thousands of motorists use it as a shortcut to reach southern parts of the district and Thondamuthur from areas in and around Vadavalli and Thadagam Road.

R Siraj, a varkey baker, said, “I was forced to drive all the way up to Thadagam Road, take a right and then turn to Sundapalayam Road to go to Perur for work. It was not only tiring but also used to take me at least 10 minutes longer.” He was happy to ride through Seeranaickenpalayam Road on Saturday.

Seeranaickenpalayam Road connects PN Pudur with Sundapalayam Road. When it was closed for repair works, hundreds of agriculture students had a hard time reaching paddy breeding stations and grounds. Other commuters too had to take roundabout routes.

“Many people from Vadavalli and PN Pudur travel regularly to areas such as Selvapuram, Perur, Ukkadam and RS Puram. This shortcut is critical part of their route,” said N Chandran, an activist from the area.

Roads on both sides of the bridge too have got a makeover. “The bridge and roads on its both sides were in a terrible condition with deep potholes,” recalled courier delivery boy G Manikandan. “It was a nightmare to ride through the stretch. I was afraid of slipping and falling down. But now that the roads have been relaid, they are flat and smooth to ride on,” he said.

Many residents of Seernaickenpalayam also heaved a sigh of relief, saying they no longer have to travel all the way to Veerakeralam to reach either Marudhamalai Road or Sundapalayam Road as the main road was now open. They are also satisfied with the newly relaid interior roads. Kaveri G, a resident, said, “We had been riding on bad roads for so many years. With new roads around, our area looks different now.”

The new bridge is wider and higher, allowing two-way movement of vehicles and preventing sewage from flowing over the bridge during rain. The bridge was widened to 11m from 7m, while its height has been increased to 10ft from the earlier 5ft.

Coimbatore: The city police are on the lookout for an unidentified woman, who stole gold ornaments from an elderly woman near Gandhipuram bus stand.

According to a police source, the accused befriended M Maruthayi, 65, a resident of Karur, while she was waiting at the central bus stand on November 19. “She approached Maruthayi and initiated a conversion. She told her that she has been receiving old age pension and offered to help Maruthayi to avail the same if she was interested,” the source said.

When Maruthayi showed interest, the woman asked her to remove her gold ornaments, saying she would look wealthier with them and that officials were likely to reject her application. Maruthayi subsequently removed her gold chain that weighed two sovereigns.

“The woman then offered to help her wrap the ornament. After handing over a package to her, the woman left the place asking Maruthayi to wait for her. As she didn’t return, Maruthayi opened the package and found it contained only stones and not her chain,” the source said.

On Friday, Maruthayi filed a complaint with the Kattoor police, who registered a case under Section 379 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code.

A similar incident had taken place at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital a few days ago when two people stole gold ornaments weighing 7.5 sovereign from a woman by promising her financial assistance to meet her medical expenses. Police had arrested the duo - Krishnakumar and Vijayalakshmi - in that case.

CHENNAI: Police on Saturday seized about 11 tonnes of red sanders from a warehouse in Perungalathur near Maraimalai Nagar. They later handed over the seized logs to forest officials in Chengalpet. Based on a tip, personnel from the Maraimalai Nagar police station raided a warehouse on Kamarajar Salai in Maraimalai Nagar in the morning and found red sanders logs hidden under areca palm trees at the facility. Later, they informed district forest ranger Pandurangan, who subsequently arrived at the spot with his team. Investigation revealed that the warehouse belonged to Palani of Ambattur. He had rented it out to Sheik Ali of Manali for Rs 1.8 lakh a month. After preliminary inquiries, forest officials said that Sheik Ali hired the premises on December 16 claiming that areca stems for export would be stored there.

After the red sanders logs were removed, the warehouse was sealed. A hunt has been launched for both Palani and Sheik Ali, as they have absconded. In the past one year, red sanders have been seized from multiple warehouses in Maraimalai Nagar and forest officials are investigating if the culprits use the area to hide the logs to be later smuggled to different places.

Coimbatore: The Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam has appealed to the Union finance ministry to ensure that at least government banks in rural areas have staff who are proficient in local language. They cited the example of Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) branch in Thirumalaiyampalayam, saying the customers were suffering as its manager and staff didn’t know Tamil.

Pointing out that the IOB branch in Thirumalaiyampalayam was serving a large rural population of farmers and self-help groups, the association said of the seven staff members only one was proficient in reading and writing Tamil. “The new bank manager, who took charge three months ago, is refusing to sanction gold and agriculture loans. He is also reluctant to sanction loans to a self-help group, which had taken a loan in 2011 and has been promptly paying it back,” said P Kandasamy, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam.

The farmers said they had taken up the issue with the Chennai headquarters following which the bank manager agreed to sanction loans. “But he still asks for multiple approvals and documents. All we demand is that they place managers, who understand the local language. So, villagers can show them necessary guarantee documents and convince them for a loan,” Kandasamy said.

The farmers also said they were opposed to the central government’s decision to withdraw the interest subsidy given on agri gold loans. “The government usually gives a 3% interest subsidy on agri gold loans, which are availed at an interest of 7%. So, farmers need to pay only 4% interest. Now, there are talks of removing the subsidy and also increasing interest to 11%. This will only push farmers to approach usuries and lead to their financial ruin” said Karthik Krishnakumar, treasurer, Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam.

Coimbatore: Administrative workers of the school education department want the State government to create administrative personal assistant (PA) posts for chief educational officers (CEOs).

At present, there are two PAs for CEOs, one in the cadre of high school headmaster and another in the cadre of higher secondary school headmaster. Administrative workers said these PAs would be able to assist CEOs only in academic functions and school services and not in administrative functions.

There is a need for a PA with administrative knowledge to supervise and deal with files related to finance, postings or those related to litigations, state president of Palli Kalvi Thurai Nirvaga Aluvalar Sangam (School Education Department Administrative Staff Association) T L Srinivasan said. “In the offices of district education officers (DEOs), files from the superintendent would be passed to DEOs only after being run through the PA. But in CEO offices, they are sent from the superintendent directly to the CEOs. As a result, there would be no administrative guidance for CEOs. The PAs, who are from HM cadre, would not have the experience of handling files related to laws and rules when they were working in schools. So, it is necessary to have a PA for CEOs from administrative side to ensure work on such files are done properly,” he said.

Files relating to financial bills and post approvals could be properly checked only by personnel with administrative experience, Srinivasan said. “Of the 52 DEO offices across the state that were created two years ago, 26 need a PA each and 120 superintendents. The government should fill these posts also.”

The members of the association had recently represented the demands to the commissioner of school education.

UDHAGAMANDALAM: The 12 British-era postal cash bags found among garbage at the waste management park at Ottupattarai in Coonoor will soon find a place in the Government Museum in Ooty.

A team of volunteers of the Clean Coonoor initiative had found the bags while segregating garbage a few days ago.

The bags were found in a fresh batch of trash, said Vasanthan, a member of Clean Coonoor. “Volunteer Navin Joseph had noticed the bags, which looked quite old but in good shape, thanks to the tough leather and excellent workmanship,” he said.

Vasanthan approached the curator of the Coimbatore Government Museum, Sivakumar, to find out more about the bags.

Sivakumar’s research revealed that they were Indian postal department’s money order bags. Names of post offices with pin codes are printed on the bags, Sivakumar said.

“Enquiries with retired postal department staff revealed that those are postal money bags which were in use till the late 70s. There is a provision to lock the bags using two keys. While one key was kept at the post office from where the money was sent, the other was kept at the post office at the receiving end,” he said.

Names of post offices at Coonoor Railway Station, Kolacombai and Kundha Bridge, among others, are imprinted on the bags. “The money orders carried in those bags were the sole means of financial transaction across the length and breadth of rural India,” Vasanthan said. “It is a shame that such priceless objects were found in garbage.”

BENGALURU: Reiterating that if India wants to be a great financial and political power, it must first become a great power in science, Prof CNR Rao said it won’t happen unless young scientists work honestly towards doing good science.

“You must have heard some speeches yesterday too...But in India, science doesn’t get importance like some other fields, and unless you give importance to science, India will be a secondary country,” Rao said at the inaugural of the Children’s Science Congress at ISC-2020.

While pointing out that India lacks hard-working and dedicated scientists, he said most people just want money and do all kinds of things and do science only on the side.

“But science is a lifetime occupation and not something easy. Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) is easy to please, you can all make some money quickly, but what about Saraswati (goddess of knowledge)? She will require everything you have before she gives something to you,” he said.

Citing the example of how China deals with science, he said India cannot match the neighbour in quantity or quality. “The question we need to ask is why is India not on top? And then we need to address it. But such discussions aren’t happening in the country,” he said.

Arguing that science unlike other fields is not just a profession but an occupation for life, Rao said it does not discriminate as long as scientists are willing to put in hard work and pursue challenges. “Science does not know religion, caste or colour. It only wants a good mind. Not a brain, which even small animals have, but a good mind is what enables science. Also, background doesn’t matter. There are so many examples of people from poor backgrounds doing great science,” Rao said.

Pointing out how several great findings and discoveries in science have come from people with engineering degrees, he said: “You don’t even need a degree in science or lots of money. If you put your mind to solving problems, science will never let you down.”

Rao said Dmitri Mendeleev, the Russian scientist who developed the periodic table in 1869, was a great example of how dedication results in good science. “He didn’t have a great background, but he had a commitment to science.

NEW DELHI: In a few years, footpaths and cycle tracks would meander through Delhi forests, making the national capital friendly for pedestrians and cyclists. In a bid to shift towards greener mobility, the foundation of a 33-kilometre-long corridor called the ‘Delhi Cycle Walk’ will be laid on Monday at Tughlaqabad .Union home minister Amit Shah will lay the foundation stone of the Rs 550 crore project that Delhi Development Authority has claimed to complete by 2024. The corridor will connect the residential areas in South Delhi such as Tughlaqabad, Greater Kailash, Saket and Nehru Place, and will pass through the city’s green lungs, including Jahanpanah forest.Officials concerned said that the main objectives of the project include making the city walkable and environment-friendly; helping people save money by encouraging them to walk down or cycle to their places of work, shopping and studies; reducing pollution; connecting all the forests of the city; and revival of the dried-up lakes.To ensure connectivity access, origin and destination points have been mapped which are proposed to be interlinked to each other by the tracks for cycling and walking. It will be a loop around the city like a ring and connect metro stations, bus stands, high density residential areas, business districts, industrial areas, recreational centres and green areas.The width of both the cycle track and the walkway will be 2.4 metres each with a green strip of a metre width separating the two. The cycle walk will be a controlled track with defined and secure entrance points near residential areas and exit points near places of workplaces, malls and schools. These points of entry shall be called Origin Destination plazas and shall have all facilities for washrooms, cafés, cycle repairs and parking slots.An official said that the Cycle Walk tracks shall move seamlessly from one forest to another with small water lakes also being created to solve the waterlogging problem in sunken areas along the roads in these forests.As a part of the same project, solar lights will be installed across the stretch; CCTV cameras will be installed every 100 metres and a centralized monitoring station shall also be made; more public toilets will be constructed; and rainwater harvesting chambers and vehicle parking area shall also be made.Over 11 lakh active cyclists use the roads of Delhi, officials claim. Most of these are regular commuters who pedal from home to work and back. “Typically distances travelled by them are under 10 km. Most cyclists prefer to use cycle lanes wherever they are clean and contiguous. Apart from low wage-earning working population, cycling enthusiasts and students also use cycling as a way to commute. While the percentage is small, it can increase in case a safe, convenient and practical option is available,” said an official.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73104687,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-195966,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/33km-green-corridor-to-connect-s-delhis-residential-areas-in-4-yrs/articleshow/73103747.cms

Erode: A lone tusker damaged four thatched roof houses and a compound wall of a government school near Thalaimalai in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) forest range here in the early hours of Saturday. It also raided standing crops in the area.

The tusker had been camping at Gandhi Nagar hamlet in STR for the past couple of days. P Mathesh, a villager, said, “The elephant damaged banana plants, sugarcane and maize crops around 2am on Saturday.”

When the villagers attempted to chase the tusker away into the forest, it entered the village and damaged four thatched roof houses and the compound wall of the government elementary school, he said.

When alerted, forest officials rushed to the spot and chased the animal away into the forest by bursting firecrackers and using tom-toms.

“We have chased the tusker away into the deep forest and it is unlikely to come back again. We will, however, monitor the elephant’s movements for a few days,” a forest official said.

The villagers, meanwhile, said they had suffered huge losses in the elephant raid. They also urged the forest officials to find a permanent solution to prevent wild elephants from entering the village to raid standing crops.

Visakhapatnam: A brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation) was treated for the first time using stereotactic radio surgery (SRS) and surface guided radiation therapy (SGRT) in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, at Omega Hospitals in the city.

SRS is a non-surgical radiation therapy used to treat functional abnormalities and small tumors of the brain. It can deliver precisely-targeted radiation in fewer high-dose treatments than traditional therapy, which can help preserve healthy tissue. SGRT is a rapidly growing technique which uses stereo vision technology to track patients’ surface in 3D, for setup and motion management during radiotherapy.

Nagpur: The Anti-Adulteration Consumer Society (AACS) was felicitated by Food and Civil Supplies officials on the occasion of National Consumer Day on December 24 for completing a decade in the field of food safety. AACS founder Mohd Shahid Sharif says the task of protecting consumers is now more important with online platforms catering to multiple products.

“For a consumer, sometimes it’s not worth the time or effort to raise objection over quality of products. And that's why many companies take advantage of gullible consumers. We want to raise awareness about consumer rights, process of filing complaints etc so that nobody can take them for a ride,” said Sharif.

Leeladhar Wadekar, food and civil supply officer felicitated the organization with a letter of appreciation. Sharif said, “We have successfully fought cases of adulterated oil, expired food products, cheating in weight or quantity of fuel etc. Our mission is to arm every citizen with enough information so that they can identify malpractices easily,” said Sharif.

In February, AACS will be organizing a free workshop for citizens about consumer rights. Experts from different sectors will speak about products in their industry and what basic quality they need to adhere to.

Rajasthan deputy CM Sachin Pilot (file photo)

JAIPUR: In an embarrassing development for the Ashok Gehlot-led Rajasthan government, state Congress chief and deputy CM Sachin Pilot on Saturday slammed its handling of the infant deaths in Kota’s JK Lon Hospital and demanded accountability. As many as 107 infants have died in the hospital in the past 35 days.

After paying a visit to the Kota hospital, Pilot said the state government could not escape responsibility by pointing fingers at the previous government as “this is not a small incident, but a heart-wrenching one”. “I think our response to the entire episode could have been more sensitive and more compassionate. After 13 months in government, it may not serve any purpose (for us) to keep pointing towards the previous government’s wrongdoings or misdeeds,” he said.

He said, “As many as 107 children have died. It is not stopping. I have met some of the bereaved family members. I have no words to express their grief and hurt.

The poor strata of society depends on government hospitals. Rolling out statistics will not do any good. We must infuse confidence in people that this kind of incident will not occur again. That is the demand of the people as well.”

Pilot said people voted out the previous government for its failures and blaming it will not absolve the present government of its responsibility.

Coimbatore: The agriculture department is inching closer to achieving its target of distributing five lakh palmyra seeds to farmers across the district. According to officials, they have already distributed 3.5 lakh palmyra seeds in the past three months and the remaining 1.5 lakh seeds would be distributed by the end of this month. The seeds, they said, were sourced from the district and other districts, and federations that promote palmyra.

The objective of the initiative is to increase the coverage of palmyra trees - Tamil Nadu’s state tree - in the state.

An agriculture officer said they were also collaborating with the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) to implement the project. “Wherever there are farm ponds, we work with DRDA to maintain them and plant palmyra seeds around them. The tree, which draws water from deep, would help preserve groundwater levels and strengthen tank bunds.”

The official said they were planting the seeds not only on farms, but also in common areas and around waterbodies. “We also see to it that seeds are planted on the bunds of common ponds and tanks.”

Pointing out that palmyra has a very low rate of germination and requires a long time to germinate, the official said around 20% of planted seeds was likely to germinate.

Apart from the agriculture department, environment forums have also been planting palmyra seeds near water bodies, on forest boundaries and other areas in the district. R Manikandan, organizer of Kovai Kulangal Padhukappu Amaippu said their volunteers had planted around 1.25 lakh palmyra seeds in the district last year. “Of them, around 5% has survived.”

354,['5/01/2020'],SILK to cut parts of grounded ships,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Kannur: Following the failure to tow away the two ships that ran aground when they were being brought to the ship-breaking unit of Steel Industries Ltd Kerala (SILK) at Azhikkal here in the monsoon season, the meeting of the officials and the local body representatives, called under the initiative of Azhikode panchayat on Saturday, decided to cut the rudder and propeller of the ships and tow them away after dredging the area where the ships have been stuck at Dharmadom and Azhikkal.

“We have decided to safely cut the rudders and propellers so that it can be towed away after dredging, and we will ensure there is no pollution,” said Jayesh Anand, the in-charge of the Silk unit. The dredging would be done in an 80m stretch, with 20m width and 3m depth, without causing problems to residents.

The two Maldivian ships that broke from the tug ran aground due to rough sea in August 2019. Though a Kochi-based agency was given the contract to tow away the ships, it could not do anything major.

The company would be able to tow them away if the propellers and rudders are cut and the surrounding area is dredged further, according to SILK.

But this is a drama to break the ship in a step-by-step manner, violating all rules and they would strengthen the agitation, said the action committee.

“There were many efforts in the past few months to break the ships at sea but it was due to our opposition that the authorities withdrew from the move,” said M K Manoharan, chairman of the action committee. When there are state-of-the-art technologies to tow away the ships or even lift them from the bottom of the sea, why does it take so long to lift the ships, he asked.

He said they were not formally invited for the meeting and the information was passed to them at the midnight and hence they did not attend it.

Even if the ships are towed away, SILK will not be permitted to break it violating the rules, he said, adding that the unit has no license to break the ships.

However, the Silk authorities said they would break the ships after getting all clearance from the local body and the pollution control board.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has arrested an engineer while he was trying to extort money from politicians by threatening to get their names delisted from the candidate list of their respective parties.

Police suspect that the man is a part of a racket that has even been duping students on the pretext of providing fake marksheets. The cops have seized a mobile phone from him, in which he was found to be in contact with a few people who were found to be involved in duping other politicians in a similar way.

Police said that they received a complaint from Sumit Goel, son of Delhi legislative assembly speaker Ram Niwas Goel, on Wednesday, in which he mentioned that a man named Vishal Sagar had approached him saying that he needed to pay Rs 2.5 crore to secure Ram Niwas’ seat, out of which Rs 50 lakh needed to paid in advance.

Speaking to TOI, Sumit said that the man posed as a complainant and entered his office in Shahdara on Wednesday afternoon. He approached him saying that he was known to a senior functionary from the party and needed to meet Goel personally. “When I asked his purpose of meeting my father, he said that the time had come for my father to meet him instead,” said Sumit.

Sagar claimed that the senior party leaders had decided to strike off Ram Niwas’ name as a candidate from the Gandhi Nagar constituency, but he could arrange for a method to get it back on the list. He even called his “senior” based in Bangalore so that Sumit could have a word with him.

“I realised that he was trying to extort money since my father’s name was never proposed for the Gandhi Nagar constituency. I informed my father and the cops about it,” said Sumit. Sagar was handed over to the police and interrogated, during which he claimed to be a mechanical engineer who was part of a group that had been duping people by threatening them in a similar way.

During interrogation, Sagar said that he is a resident of Vasant Nagar in Vasant Vihar and had joined the gang to earn quick money. The cops will issue an advisory for political parties to warn them about the racket.

KOCHI: The geotube project at Chellanam coastal hamlet that had resumed in November after many legal hassles, is once again stalled. Though around eight tubes have been filled by the contractor and laid near the Velankanni Church in December, the entire work was stopped citing lack of sand to fill the tubes.

Officials at the irrigation department, which is monitoring the project, said that though they have asked the contractor to stop the work and conduct a dredge survey to meet the sand requirements, no initiative has been made in this direction yet. But people associated with the contractor said that the survey will begin on Monday and dredge works will start soon.

“The court has given six months to the contractor to finish the project and the contractor said that it will be completed by March. The filling of tubes needs to be speedier and we have told the contractor to do the needful. But the sand scarcity is the immediate challenge and it is yet to be seen how the contractor will solve it. The pace of the project needs to be increased to complete the project within stipulated time,” said an irrigation department official.

It was on November 11, PWD contractor Mohammed Niyas, who had received the renewed contract following a high court order that settled a legal dispute between the irrigation department and the contractor, started filling the geotubes at the northern side of Velankanni Church. Then the contractor had said that the project will be completed before the deadline by the end of March 2020. They have given subcontract of the work to a Noida-based company and the work was progressing until the scarcity of sand became an issue.

“Earlier the lack of enough sand was a challenge but the then district collector had issued a notice to irrigation and panchayat officials to give permission to take sand from anywhere in Chellanam. But the sand which had been procured from the canals here were sufficient to fill only eight tubes, which are laid at the northern side of Velankanni Church. Around 10 more tubes have to be filled to complete the works at this site. Though we tested the sand from the canal, we found it muddy and cleaning the sand will be time-consuming. We plan to dredge sand up to 500m off the coast and the survey will begin on Monday,” said a source associated with the sub-contractor.

Through the project, the contractor will lay geotubes at a total length of 1km and at a height of 5m at five places in Chellanam coast, including Velankanni, Bazar, Companypady and Maruvakkad.

Meanwhile, the residents have once again started the protest alleging that the contractor does not have any previous expertise in constructing geotube walls.

NEW DELHI: Speaking out against Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens , chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday that these would force not only Muslims, but Hindus also to leave the country . At a town hall in Janakpuri, where he presented a report card on the performance of his government in five years, Kejriwal called CAA a strange law, expressing the fear that some spies may masquerade as Hindus and come to India under this act.

Asking people to understand the chronology, the chief minister said under NRC everyone will have to prove their citizenship. “Aadhaar and PAN cards will not be considered for proving citizenship. The government says only birth certificates will be considered. If you produce your and parents’ birth certificates, you will be considered citizens, irrespective of religion. If you are a Muslim and if you are unable to produce the birth documents, you will be asked to leave the country,” said the CM.

“If you are Hindu and have come from Pakistan, you will get citizenship,” he said. “There is a misunderstanding among people that only Muslims will be asked to leave the country. All those Hindus who have not come from Pakistan and are unable to produce their birth certificates and that of their parents will also be asked to leave the country.”

About home minister Amit Shah’s statements that a nationwide NRC was not currently under consideration, Kejriwal said a few days ago Shah had stated on TV that he had never ruled out NRC but did not clarify when it would be implemented. “It is playing with words. CAA has been brought to clear the way for NRC. Together, CAA and NRC will create a dangerous situation. I believe the country does not need such laws. The country is facing unemployment, economy is down and inflation is high. Had the PM said the government will never bring NRC, things would have normalised, but he just said that currently the government is not considering NRC,” pointed out Kejriwal.

Asked whether the persecuted minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bagaladesh who want to come to India should not be accommodated, Kejriwal said that first crores of Hindus of the country need jobs and social security. “Around 4 crore people qualify to come to India, and even if half of them arrive, who will give them jobs?” Kejriwal asked.

In the report card, Kejriwal emphasised 10 major achievements of the AAP government in the past five years in education, health, power, water, budget performance, women safety, unauthorised colonies, transport and pro-people governance besides others. He said parking and and pollution will be the key focus areas of his government in its next tenure. The CM also promised to clean up Yamuna in the next five years.

In an interaction with the audience, Kejriwal said a system will be devised in collaboration with the corporations to resolve the issue of non-availability of parking spaces in commercial and residential areas. On traffic congestion, he said the government was “redesigning roads on the lines of London, Tokyo, and France...we have already given a contract for 40 km”. Replying to a question, Kejriwal said full statehood is important for the people of Delhi and it will be a part of AAP’s election manifesto.

He announced that the proposed hike in the circle rate of agricultural land in Delhi has been approved by the LG and a notification was likely to be issued next week.

About Congress’s promise of 600 units of free electricity if elected in Delhi, Kejriwal said they should first start it in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab.

The message from the institute came hours after H Raja, BJP national secretary, tweeted criticising the choice of topic for the lecture. “Can such a lecture be organised over any other religion’s scriptures or holy book?” he asked in the tweet and tagged chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and K Pandiarajan, minister for Tamil Culture, demanding that the programme be cancelled. Many BJP sympathisers and right wing activists also joined the chorus.

“I was here to speak about the greatness of Tamil literature from Sangam era and how it gives importance to women. The focal point of the lecture was Draupadi and her greatness,” Vijaya Ramaswamy, retired professor of centre for historical studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi , told TOI. She, however, said she was informed about the cancellation of the programme citing construction activity on the premises. “I am leaving Chennai with a heavy heart,” said Vijaya Ramaswamy, a native of Kanyakumari. She came for the programme from Delhi.

A senior professor of the institute said the lecture was on the “greatness of Draupadi”, worshipped as Draupadi Amman in the state, unlike any other part of the country. “The topic was misinterpreted and misinformed to outsiders and it attracted a lot of criticism,” the professor said, but declined to comment on whether political pressure resulted in cancellation of the programme.

Educationists said the state succumbed to pressure mounted by vested interests and failed to protect the rights of educational institutions. “I never expected such a reaction to academic programmes from our state,” Vijaya Ramaswamy added.

Earlier too, there have been instances of last-minute cancellation of programmes that were opposed by the BJP.

Thiruvananathapuram: Demanding pension and health insurance coverage, former elected members to local bodies will stage a dharna in front of secretariat here on Tuesday.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala will inaugurate the dharna being organized by association of former panchayath members and councillors at 10am. “Several times we had taken up the demand with successive governments, but we are yet to get a positive response. Former MLAs and MPs receive pension and other benefits. But those who are elected to the local bodies are denied the same. Ward members work in the ground level and are forced to work almost round the clock. But once their term is over, they are ignored. This is unethical. There are several former members who suffer from various diseases. Many even suffering from terminal illness,” said N A Azeez, state president of the association.

MLAs P Aisha Potty, R Ramachandran, N A Nellikkunnu, former speaker M Vijayakumar, former MLAs V Sivankutty and Varkala Kahar, and BJP’s state secretary J R Padmakumar will attend the dharna. The association was formed seven years ago and has nearly 70,000 members. TNN

361,['5/01/2020'],Anganwadi workers stage massive protest demanding pay hike,"This story is from January 5, 2020

yyyyyyyyyyyy

Dehradun: Thousands of anganwadi workers on Saturday staged a massive protest at Hathibarkala Chowk, demanding pay rise, job regularisation and other facilities at work. The protest threw traffic out of gear at several busy stretches in the city.

The agitators started their march from Dharna Sthal around 2 pm, stayed put through two downpours in a span of five hours and continued their protest till late evening. They also tried to reach the CM’s residence, but were stopped by police.

The protest caused jams on stretches like Rajpur road, Subhash Road, EC Road and Gandhi Road, to name a few.

The women who had come from several places across the state raised anti-government slogans, saying the government had turned a blind eye to their problems. Even though the demonstrations were interrupted by rain, many of the workers continued with their protest alleging that they are now “fed up of empty promises.”

State president of Anganwadi Union, Rekha Negi said that they were disappointed at not having met the CM. “The government claims that it is accessible to everyone but then why were we stopped by police when we wanted to reach the CM, who is also the health minister of the state?” On their demands, she said, “We want free gas connections, Provident Fund (PF), health insurance and travel allowance facilities in case we need to travel for assignments. Also, if the state government wants to give us mobile phones, they must increase the allowance so that we can pay for the recharge.”

Vimla Kohli, state vice-president of the union, added, “We are the most hardworking and yet the most deprived section of government servants. We work in schools and hospitals, in cities as well as villages. Still, the government has turned a blind eye to our issues. We work day and night to ensure implementation of various government schemes. Can’t the government bring a scheme for our benefits?”

The workers are also demanding increase of their salary to Rs 21,000 per month and their helpers’ pay to Rs 11,000 per month. Among their other demands are Diwali bonus, perks based on their skills and seniority and promotions in due time. The union members said that if the state government failed to meet their demands, they would resort to protests across the state and sit on strikes. The state has around 15,000 anganwadi workers and 14,000 helpers.

362,['5/01/2020'],Brace for power shock as discoms seek to recover old losses from you,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Bhopal: Does another shock await power consumers? After urging MP electricity regulatory commission to allow them to recover Rs 25,000 crore losses — incurred during the previous BJP government — from consumers, and then additionally seeking 5% tariff hike for the next fiscal, discoms now want to recover Rs 5,000 crore losses incurred in 2018-19 fiscal, again from consumers.

If MPERC allows all three requests, your power tariff will shoot up by more than 300%.

Sample this: If MPERC allows only 50% of the Rs 25,000 crore losses incurred between 2015-16 and 2017-18, and 50% of the Rs 5,000 losses incurred in 2018-19, and the Rs 2,000 crore estimated revenue loss for the next financial year, then a consumer who uses two ACs (5-star), a couple of fans, an LED TV, and five LED bulbs — together about 425 units of electricity a month — will have to shell out a whopping Rs 1,500 extra every month. So, if you are paying around Rs 3,600 for using 425 units, your bill will be a whopping Rs 5100 (approx).

Discoms submitted true-up petitions for 2014 to 2017 and 2018-19 in the second week of November last year. In December, they submitted the annual revenue requirement (ARR) report for 2020-21 fiscal and claimed Rs 2,000 estimated losses. Now, in early January, discoms have submitted true-up petition for 2018-19, claiming that they incurred Rs 5,000 crore loss that year and MPERC should allow them to recover it from consumers.

MPERC sources said it has scheduled a hearing on January 21 for the 2018-19 true-up petition and will seek objections from the public before taking its decision.

Power tariff for a fiscal is determined on the basis of the projected consumption and sale of energy and estimated expenditures related to purchase, other expenses and income from sale of energy. Discoms seek hikes through ARR petition so that they can bridge the gap between their estimated income and loss. True-up losses are calculated at the end of the fiscal.

Thiruvananthapuram: A first-ever national conference for the deafblind has been organized by National Institute of Speech and Hearing in association with Society for the Empowerment of the Deafblind. A decision to set up a centre under Nish to address concerns and formulate projects for the deafblind was announced at the two-day conference that began here on Saturday.

A social justice department survey had found that there are approximately 850 deafblind people in the state. “Chennai-based Chetana Trust will associate with the centre, providing training and trainers. Besides, two suitable posts will be reserved for Public Service Commission jobs, and health, social justice and women and child development minister KK Shailaja will initiate steps regarding this,” secretary (social justice and women and child development) Biju Prabhakar said, adding that the upcoming centre at Nish will function as the nodal centre for the deaf and blind.

More than 60 delegates from various parts of the country are participating in the conference, interacting with each other with the help of personal interpreters. The conference, themed ‘inclusion through technology and advocacy’, provided at platform for participants to share their experiences on overcoming challenges in life and on how technology has helped make their lives easier.

Deafblindness or dual sensory impairment (DSI) is a distinctive disability, which encompasses varying degrees of hearing impairment and low vision. According to studies, its impact is not merely an addition of the impact of the two disabilities, but it is manifold. Deafblind children have cognitive, speech, motor and social delay. They also can have multiple medical needs, which should be identified and met. It is estimated that there are more than 500,000 deafblind adults and children in the country.

Hyderabad: Telangana and AP Joint Action Committee against Citizenship Amendment Act on Saturday held a protest at Dharna Chowk, Indira Park.

In the line of fire of those who addressed that huge gathering were the BJP, TRS and AIMIM. The demonstrators rejected Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) calling it unconstitutional. They vowed not to fill any form to prove their citizenship and played the National Anthem at the end of the protest meet.

“We will not fill National Population Register (NPR) form. The questionnaire has changed. We have no issues with the old form and questions mentioned in it,” said Mohammed Mushtaq Malik, convenor of the JAC.

Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT) spokesperson Amjadullah Khan lashed out at the TRS and AIMIM for collusion. “Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should be vocal against Citizenship Amendment Act like West Bengal and Kerala were. As on today, he is appeasing Muslims with the help of Asaduddin Owaisi. We are afraid he will change his attitude towards Muslims after municipal elections,” Khan said. Unlike regular public meetings, a lot of burqa-clad women were present and raised slogans against CAA. With the Tricolour in their hands, women raised Azadi slogans along with other protesters. “This government (BJP) unlike previous governments is taking major decisions in haste. This time they questioned our nationality based on our religion,” said a woman protester.

“If the same Act was passed by any other government, the impact would be less. Many Muslims who I know don’t have a good opinion about the Centre. We have come here to vent our anger against discriminatory proposals,” said Syed Abdul Kashaf, a protester.

366,['5/01/2020'],Just 91 trees to be shifted for Azimganj Sarai work: Aga Khan Trust for Culture,"National Zoological Park

NEW DELHI: Refuting claims that over 2,000 trees could be cut down to connect Azimganj Sarai with the National Zoological Park , the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), which is undertaking the conservation of the 16th century fort-like structure, clarified on Saturday that only 91 trees would be required to be moved from the area and transplanted elsewhere. Permission for this has already been sought.Reacting to TOI’s story on Friday on an environmental activist requesting the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change to stop the felling of 2,000 trees, AKTC said a detailed survey had revealed 706 trees in and around the structure, of which only 97 were identified for felling since they were growing atop the archaeological remains. This number was later pruned to 91.“The claims of over 2,000 trees being chopped is absolutely false. The area itself has just around 700 trees,” Ratish Nanda, project director, AKTC, told TOI. “We found 91 trees growing on the medieval inn complex and conservation work requires their transplantation.”Delhi government’s department of archaeology had requested the transplantation of the trees. “We have no intention to transplant or chop any tree growing in the courtyard. Also, contrary to the report printed, there are no sandalwood trees and most of the standing trees are the invasive subabul species,” asserted Nanda.Conservation work at the site has actually been going on for the past five years. Phase 1 of the project is finished and the second phase will involve repairing the 9-metre wall and gateway of the medieval sarai. There are 108 individual rooms and a large courtyard in the middle. Nanda said most of the walls were in a dilapidated state, and some, including those adjoining the zoo, had also collapsed.“In Phase 1, we stabilised the two wings of the sarai comprising 54 vaulted cells and their arched openings,” disclosed Nanda. “Phase 2 can only begin after the saplings growing on the ruins are moved. Without restoration, there is every likelihood that the walls will collapse, possibly injuring the jackals and elephants inhabiting the area.”AKTC said there were no current plans to provide visitor access to the Azimganj Sarai from the Delhi zoo side. It said the Union housing and urban affairs ministry had suggested to the environment ministry that visitors should be permitted only from the Sundar Nursery side. Nanda said the conservation could lead to the sarai being added to the World Heritage Site of Humayun’s Tomb, which has six such recognised monuments.The plans propose entry to Azimgarh Sarai through its western gateway on the Sundar Nursery side. “Even though the site is located within Delhi zoo’s residential area and not its operational area, a 2.4-metre wall has been built to enhance security and prevent animals moving to the park area,” AKTC noted in its letter to the Delhi zoo director in October 2019. Access to the sarai will be through a double-door fitted with automatic door closers to allow a single visitor to enter at a time.“We don’t have plans at the moment for commercial events or an orchestra or paid events at Azimganj Sarai,” added Nanda. “Also, no land transfer has been sought and it is strange for AKTC to be charged with trying to acquire land. We only want to conserve the old sarai and get visitor access to this protected monument.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73105741,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-171836,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/just-91-trees-to-be-shifted-for-sarai-work-aktc/articleshow/73103786.cms

CM Rawat had assured to return the hiked fees to students of Ayurvedic colleges

DEHRADUN: Activist and BJP member Ravindra Jugran on Saturday asked the state government to ensure that the hiked fees paid by students of private Ayurvedic colleges across Uttarakhand is returned to them. He also threatened to move court against Union HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and state Ayush minister Harak Singh Rawat if the students aren’t paid back their fees within three weeks.

“On November 21 last year, CM Trivendra Singh Rawat had ordered all colleges to immediately comply with the Uttarakhand high court (HC) order and return the hiked fees. But still, nothing has been done,” said Jugran. He further claimed that both Harak Singh Rawat and Nishank have direct or indirect stake in Ayurvedic colleges in state.

To recall, CM Rawat had assured that the state government will ensure compliance of the HC order which had asked Ayurvedic colleges to return the hiked fees to all students. The CM had also announced to form a fee fixation committee which would be headed by a HC judge to ensure compliance of the order.

The decision of ensuring the compliance of the HC order was taken in an emergency meeting called by the chief minister on November 21, 2019 which was attended by Ayush minister Harak Singh Rawat, Ayush secretary Dilip Jawalkar and officials of Uttarakhand Ayurvedic University.

The meeting was called in the wake of Ayurvedic students protesting against “an arbitrary fee hike of around 200%-300%”. They alleged that Ayurvedic colleges had hiked their fees to Rs 2.5-Rs 3 lakh from Rs 80,000.

While hearing the matter last year, Uttarakhand HC had said that the fee hike was “unreasonably high” while ordering the colleges to return the fees.

As many private Ayurvedic colleges had failed to comply with the HC order, the court had also issued a contempt order on October 22, 2019 against the owners of some private colleges seeking a response within three weeks.

369,['5/01/2020'],Cabinet clears Rs 5 lakh medical insurance cover for state staff,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Bhopal: In a major decision, Kamal Nath government on Saturday decided to bring 12.55 lakh state employees, pensioners and their families under medical insurance cover. The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting headed by chief minister Nath at the state secretariat.

Till now, the state government employees and pensioners were not covered under medical insurance and regular employees had medical reimbursement facility. The medical insurance scheme announced is a contributory scheme that would be optional for employees of the state undertakings (corporations and boards).

The scheme has been drafted on the lines of those for All India services that has been adopted by some states.

Briefing newsmen minister for health Tulsi Silawat said, “Mukhya Mantri Samuhik Swasth Bima Yojana (Chief Minister’s Group Health Insurance Scheme) effective from April 1 will make every government employee and his or her family eligible for free medical treatment up to Rs 5 lakh per annum. For some critical diseases, the eligibility maybe increased to Rs 10 lakh per annum. OPD (Out Patient Department) treatment in hospitals will be free up to Rs 10,000 per annum.”

Claiming it a historic decision taken by the state government, Silawat said that retired state government employees under previous regimes received free medication worth Rs 288 per annum. While all employees will be eligible for Rs 5 lakh medical treatment, a permission will be necessary from a state-level medical board for approval to increase the insurance cover to Rs 10 lakh for specific critical diseases.

Those who will be covered under the insurance scheme include 5,73,752 state government employees of various departments, another 1,79,470 government school teachers and 4,91,666 retired state personnel. Implementation of the scheme will incur a financial burden of Rs 756.54 crore on the exchequer. Portion of the premium will be deducted from employees’ salaries and the amount will be determined the salary grades.

Minister for higher education Jeetu Patwari explained, “While approving the scheme, the chief minister and cabinet has kept the number of beneficiaries open. If there are some departments or employees who have been missed out, then they will also be included in the scheme later.

Other decisions: Second phase of farm loan waiver starts

After the cabinet meeting on Saturday afternoon, state government claimed that the second phase of Jai Kisan Fasal Rin Maafi Yojana has been launched throughout the state. “In the first phase, 21 lakh farmers have been benefitted under the farm loan waiver scheme up to Rs 50,000. In the second phase 10 lakh more farmers have been listed for loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh,” minister for PWD Sajjan Singh Verma said. “The third list of farmers will also be ready soon. These will be of those agriculturists who have taken more than two farm loans on a single agricultural field,” he added.

Council of ministers also increased cabinet ministers’ discretionary fund from Rs 50 lakh to Rs One crore. Silawat argued, “When ministers visit the districts and villages, many poor people ask for help. That is why the discretionary fund been increased.” Previously, discretionary fund for cabinet ministers was Rs 50 lakh and ministers of state Rs 35 lakh. Now cabinet ministers will get Rs One crore and ministers of state Rs 60 lakh. However, all 28 ministers in the Kamal Nath government have cabinet rank, there are no ministers of state.

In another decision, cabinet decided to review BPL ration card holders. Minister for food and civil supplies Pradyumn Singh Tomar said, “There are 1.17 crore ration cards for a total 5.40 crore beneficiaries. We know 3% to 4% of these are either in the names of deceased persons, women who have been married and settled elsewhere or frauds. We have decided to start a campaign to reject these fraudulent or deceased persons’ names and issue ration cards to new holders. There are 46 lakh persons waiting for ration cards,” he said.

Cabinet also decided to recruit 1,359 guest teachers to fill vacancies of teachers in schools. Minister for higher education Jeetu Patwari said, “Approval has been given for recruitment of guest teachers. The government wants to regularize all guest teachers so not a single person is left out.” Cabinet also gave its nod for 560 new posts in the women and child development department.

How the scheme works

Hyderabad: Telangana Congress president and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy on Saturday demanded that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao convene a special session of the legislative assembly to pass a resolution rejecting CAA and NRC.

Addressing a municipal elections’ preparatory meeting in Miryalguda, Uttam said several chief ministers had already announced that they would not implement CAA and NRC. “KCR has been silent on the issue. He has been supporting the (Narendra) Modi government at the Centre since 2014. He backed them on demonetisation, GST and elections of President and Vice President of India,” he said.

He alleged that KCR has not fulfilled the promises, including providing 12% reservation in jobs and education to Muslims, he had made in April 2014.

Uttam urged the unemployed youngster to give KCR a big shock in the coming elections. “The youth should ensure the defeat of TRS,” he said.

He added that Congress would win a majority of seats in the polls.

371,['5/01/2020'],Safety additions on Biodiversity Flyover mostly just distractions?,"HYDERABAD: A month after an accident on Biodiversity Flyover left one dead and injured many, it was reopened on Saturday.When TOI drove over the flyover, several features stood out: An excessive number of signages, rumble strips and speed-breakers just ahead of the sharp curve where the accident had happened.The abrupt ride caused several vehicles to stop, and restart engines at the scene of the widely reported accident. Infrastructural expert Dr SP Anchuri who is the vice president of Structural Engineers World Congress — India, who joined TOI’s commute said the new additions were likely to have a ripple effect on traffic jams along Gachbowli-Miyapur main road and other connecting roads during peak hours.“Putting speed breakers on flyovers, especially in the ascend is avoided as a rule. Since the structural defect cannot be rectified now, the changes can only serve as a precautionary measure.The general tendency of motorists is to speed up after crossing speed breakers. Hence, the placement of the speed bumps is not accurate. Another problem is that two-wheelers need a minimum speed to balance but coming down to a near stop at the bumps would itself cause many accidents, making pillion riders vulnerable to falls,” said Anchuri.As per the expert, no physical changes have been made and the changes made are more of a distraction (like signage and announcement of speed limit etc) and will serve only as precautionary measure.While a few motorists did halt on the flyover, within minutes an announcement was made the vehicles should not halt and any such vehicle will be fined. Also speed limit was being constantly announced and motorists were cautioned against over-speeding. “However, this didn’t seem to act as a deterrent to many. Ideally the motorists over-speeding should be apprehended just after to flyover’s descent so that an immediate check can be put in place,” added Anchuri. This flaw was also pointed out by motorists themselves. Umaid Khan, a motorist said that the spot where the accident happened is 15- 20 feet away where the speed-breakers should have been put.Meanwhile, the second turning of the S shaped flyover remains hidden by buildings. This is a threat to speeding vehicles.While a majority of motorists kept away from the left side of the flyover and tried driving in the middle, there were a few driving rashly too.“Even though care has been taken by the committee to suggest points when we had one drive, found that it’s not at all made any impact on the rash drivers. It will be very difficult to avoid accidents.There is need to go for a few more rectifications to ensure accident free commuting. Detailed studies should be conducted from time to time over during peak hours. Also there is a need for bringing about a change in the mindset of commuters,” added the expert.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73106716,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148855,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/safety-additions-on-biodiversity-flyover-mostly-just-distractions/articleshow/73103254.cms
372,['5/01/2020'],Increase width of service road along Beed Bypass: MLA,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Aurangabad: Aurangabad West MLA Sanjay Shirsat has sought an increase in the width of the service road along the crucial Beed bypass.

The MLA had met the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) commissioner on Thursday to seek the civic body’s action regarding the matter. According to Shirsat, in view of the increasing traffic, the width of the service road should be increased by another 2.5metre thereby bringing the total width of the road to 7.5metre.

The MLA said that the municipal commissioner has agreed to his request to increase the width of the service road.“Of the funds approved for the project, about Rs 25 crore can be used for the acquisition of land required for the road widening. Acquisition of land will be carried out through the municipal corporation as the areas on both sides of the service road fall under municipal limits,” Shirsat said.

The work of widening the 9-10km stretch of the Beed bypass from Mahanubhav Ashram to Jhalta is under way. For that purpose, the municipal corporation is conducting an anti-encroachment drive. The project to construct and widen the road, at an estimated cost of Rs 306 crore, is being funded by the state government. The World Bank project division of the Public Works Department Aurangabad is implementing the project.

The tender process has been completed and the work order is likely to be issued on January 9 or 10. As part of the project, three flyovers and three vehicle underpasses will be built on the Beed bypass which passes through Aurangabad city. Incidentally, the road is used by residents of Satara and Deolai to travel to the city as well as by cargo trucks. The narrow width of the road has led to several accidents and even deaths in the past. Subsequently, the project of widening of the road was taken up.

374,['5/01/2020'],Karnataka govt mulls renaming Ramanagara district for investment,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Chief minister BS Yeddiyurappa (File Photo)

BENGALURU: The state government is learnt to have set in motion an exercise to examine if Ramanagara district, south of Bengaluru, can be renamed Nava (New) Bengaluru. According to sources, officials from industries department in consultation with Ramanagara district administration have raised the demand.

The government is yet to take a call. When asked about the speculation on Saturday, chief minister BS Yediyurappa did not respond.

Industries department sources said Bengaluru as a brand holds great value in terms of attracting investments but unfortunately the city has reached its saturation point because of non-availability of land.

The city is investors’ favourite destination in Karnataka . In 2018-19, for instance, Bengaluru got 70% of the total investment in Karnataka. It is also among the largest technology clusters in the world.

What makes the city more conducive to IT sector growth is its strong regulatory environment for business and globally competitive talent pool. “Renaming of Ramanagara as Nava Bengaluru will naturally attract more investments,” said a senior officer privy to the information.

In 2007, Ramanagara district was carved out of the erstwhile Bengaluru Rural district comprising Ramanagara, Channapatna, Kanakapura and Magadi taluks when HD Kumarswamy, who represented Ramanagara assembly constituency, was the chief minister. Then people had demanded the new district be named Bengaluru South but it wasn’t considered for historical reasons.

375,['5/01/2020'],Suleimani killing reasserts Trump’s ‘maximum pressure policy’ to get Tehran to mend its ways,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Mourners attend funeral procession of Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia commander Abu M... Read More

NEW DELHI: The assassination of Iranian military strongman Qassim Suleimani marks a strong reassertion of US President Donald Trump ’s “maximum pressure” policy which was seemingly stalled by Tehran countering America with its own “maximum resistance” that hinges on its asymmetric warfare capability.

Faced with intense US pressure through economic sanctions that inflicted serious damage on its economy, Iran chose to escalate tensions from mid-2019, targeting shipping in the Gulf of Oman, shooting down a US drone and organising calibrated strikes on Saudi oil fields. All these actions aimed to use its leverage with militias to attack interests of America and its allies in the middle east.

In counter-attacking, Iran sought to up the stakes and Suleimani was its key man who could turn on the heat through a range of proxies and allies that included Hamas , Palestine Islamic Jihad and the Hezbollah . Though US has had extended back channel contacts with Iran, it saw the general as a high value target who might have been useful in combating ISIS but was also a threat to its interests.

The electoral calculations in the drone attack have been speculated on, but do not obscure an essential shift in US objectives under Trump — a sharper focus on getting Iran to rollback its ambitions in the middle east and significantly reduce use of various state-supported militias it has funded and armed.

This approach to Iran was driven, as experts have pointed out, by the calculation that nuclear issues were not the sole, or even the most important, point of discussion with Iran’s theocratic dispensation. Also, having chosen Saudi Arabia as its preferred partner, the Trump administration cast Iran as the greater threat in the volatile region.

Both sides have spurned dialogue, but doing so can cost Iran more. A window that opened through a third party after Iran used mines against oil tankers was understood to have been spurned by the regime. It then upped the ante again not long after Trump held back from retaliating to a drone being downed, apparently due to the high collateral cost of such military action.

Opening a dialogue could have increased Iran’s options as despite uneasiness in Europe, and stronger words from China and Russia, it is unclear how much useful support it will garner. After US nixed the nuclear deal, Iran failed to find the succour it needed to soften sanctions, despite sympathetic noises in some western capitals. Its reputation as a sponsor of militias hurt Iran despite support for the deal.

Opinion is divided whether the nuclear deal arrived at by Barack Obama had indeed encouraged Iran to mend its ways. Its actions in Yemen and Iraq suggest otherwise. It can now calculate that the threat of escalation may help its cause, but a miscalculation can also prove very costly to the Iranian leadership.

376,['5/01/2020'],"Now, corpn draws ‘kolams’ to check garbage dumping","This story is from January 5, 2020

Chennai: The ‘ kolam ’, traditionally drawn to ensure prosperity of households, over the past few days became a symbol of opposition to or support for the Citizenship Amendment Act. Now the Greater Chennai Corporation has restarted its initiative of drawing them in a bid to shame litterbugs.

On Saturday morning, shopkeepers and residents of New Farrance Road in Otteri woke up to civic staff drawing ‘kolams’ with eco-friendly themes along the road. The corporation staff said they were fed up with picking up after people who dumped garbage and household stuff they didn’t want where ever there was open space, especially in ward 73.

Corporation officials of Thiru Vi Ka nagar zone (Zone 6) went door to door campaigning for segregating garbage and assuring residents that conservancy workers will collect it at their doorstep. The civic officials also promised residents that they would be given manure generated from organic waste.

Officials said the response from residents was positive, but the dumping of garbage on open spaces has not stopped entirely. That’s when corporation officials thought of drawing ‘kolam’, a practice it has followed off and on in various parts of the city.

“We identified vulnerable points along the stretch where garbage as well as unused household items and other waste material was dumped. We were cleaning up after them for the past ten days. So, to put an end to this, we decided to opt for creative ways and draw ‘kolams’,” said Kumaravel, assistant engineer, ward 73 in Thiru Vi Ka Nagar.

Kumaravel said they hoped that since ‘kolams’ are mandatory during Margazhi season, they could appeal to people’s sentiments and curb littering in open spaces. “Based on the response to this, we will employ similar measures in other vulnerable points in all divisions in the zone,” the assistant engineer added.

Residents welcomed the move by the corporation, but also expressed scepticism whether they will keep at it. “The corporation staff do clean the stretch every day, but dumping continues nevertheless,” said Abdur Rahaman, a resident.

377,['5/01/2020'],Kerala: Strict action against drug shops near educational institutions,"This story is from January 5, 2020

T P Ramakrishnan (Photo credit: Facebook)

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government will intensify action against drug-selling shops in the vicinity of educational institutions, including refusal of permission to reopen if found guilty of the offence, labour and excise minister T P Ramakrishnan said.

“Currently, such shops reopen even though they were identified as the real perpetrators in many cases. To change the scenario, the state excise department and the local self-government institutions will together take severe action against such shops and prevent them from reopening,” he said while chairing a meeting of the executive committee of the state’s drug and addiction-free mission Vimukthi on Friday.

The minister said the excise department registered 67,713 cases under cigarettes and other tobacco products act (COTPA), 12,425 excise cases and 6,573 cases under narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances act (NDPS) in 2019.

He said a Rs 100-crore model de-addiction centre would be opened at Kinalur in Kozhikode jointly by the excise and health departments in collaboration with the Aardram mission.

The minister said that units of Vimukthi Sena would be formed in all the wards in the state by January 30 to keep track of drug-related activities. Out of the 19,499 wards in the state, Vimukthi Sena units were formed in 11,550 of them. Each unit will have five to 10 members, including two women, Anganwadi workers, Asha workers and Kudumbashree workers.

He said anti-drug clubs will be set up in all schools, professional colleges and medical colleges. Currently, such clubs are functioning in 3,739 schools and 576 colleges. “Apart from this, around 7,500 anti-drug clubs will be established in all libraries in the state. Various anti-drug campaigns such as evening gatherings, home visits and lighting the lamp against drugs will also be organized,” he said.

Vimukthi stepped up its campaign by tapping on Kudumbashree network down to the grass root level and displaying the ‘drug free Kerala ’ message on 500 KSRTC buses.

Vimukthi also prominently displayed its “say no to drug” message at food stalls of Kudumbashree at the ongoing flower show at Kanakakunnu. Apart from floating banners, display cards carrying the drug-free message have been placed on the tables set up to serve food and on the t-shirts of the suppliers.

Bhopal: A team from Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) arrived in Sagar on Saturday to investigate the crash of a trainer airplane that killed an instructor and trainee pilot on Friday evening.

Aircrash investigators inspected the accident site, where the debris of the crashed plane still lie. The single-engine Cessna of Chimes Aviation Academy (CAA) crashed into a field in dense fog just short of Dhana airport of Sagar. Instructor Ashok Makwana, 55, and trainee Piyush Chandel were killed. Both of them were from Mumbai. Their families arrived in Sagar at night. According to sources, Piyush was working as an aeronautical engineer in Doha and wanted to be a pilot.

CAA administrator Rahul Sharma said, “The accident happened because of unexpected weather conditions. There was lot of difference between the weather at 9pm and just 5 minutes later.” Asked if the fliers had taken note of IMD weather forecast and the thick fog, he said, “All aspects were taken into consideration before they took off.”

“The fog was unexpectedly thick. You ask anyone about the difference in visibility between 9pm and 9.05pm. The fog was very dense and rolled in suddenly,” he said, adding that DGCA will investigate the crash. He was not able to say how long the plane was in the air before it crashed. Asked about fuel, he said: “There was enough fuel and that it did not catch fire was the only silver lining in the tragedy.”

Sagar SP Amit Sanghi said, “We can’t investigate the crash, as it is not in our purview. It will be investigated by DGCA.” Police have registered a ‘dead person’s report’ and are investigating related aspects.

Kochi: An aspirated tooth that was stuck in the lung of a woman for three years was removed by a team of doctors at a city hospital. The tooth resembled a tumour in the lung during endoscopy.

The 63-year-old woman from Kasaragod , who complained of cough, fever, loss of appetite and weight, was treated for pneumonia initially for almost two years on the basis of sputum and biopsy reports.

Later on, she underwent endoscopy, which showed a polypoidal growth in the right lung resembling a tumour. The treating doctors also suspected the tumour to be malignant. In three years, the patient spent around Rs 5 lakh but her condition only worsened.

For further evaluation, the patient then came to Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre ( AIMS ).

At AIMS, the patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopic procedure, and the growth involving her lung was removed and the doctors noticed the impacted tooth below the growth.

“The patient was not aware of the aspirated tooth. It was molar tooth and she didn’t even know that it was missing. Though her dental hygiene was poor, she said that she had never gone to a dental surgeon in the past three years. We suspect that this could have happened in sleep,” said interventional pulmonologist (AIMS) Dr Tinku Joseph, who performed the procedure.

The tooth was then successfully removed. “This was the source for her recurrent pneumonia in the initial years and later on multiple growths resembling tumour started forming around the impacted tooth,” said Dr Joseph.

Pulmonologist Dr Sobha Subramaniam who evaluated the patient initially at AIMS said that aspiration of foreign bodies is more commonly seen in children and in adults such instances happen during sleep. Such incident is also suspected in an individual who suffers from recurrent non-resolving pneumonia.

Manoj Tiwari

NEW DELHI: Slamming Aam Aadmi Party for its remarks on unauthorised colonies, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal should apologise to the people of unauthorised colonies for making misleading remarks on the ownership rights.

“The AAP MP had left Lok Sabha proceedings when voting was taking place on the Bill introduced for conferring ownership rights to 40 lakh people living in unauthorised colonies. Kejriwal government could not fix the boundaries of unauthorised colonies within the time fixed for it and they sought extension again and again from the ministry of housing and urban affairs,” Tiwari said during a press conference and added that Kejriwal did not want to confer ownership rights to these people.

“The Narendra Modi government took over the work of regularising these colonies and completed it within 100 days,” Tiwari said, adding that AAP leaders resorted to lies to mislead these people but failed.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had described the registry papers and conveyance deeds handed over to 20 residents of unauthorised colonies by union minister Hardeep Puri on Friday as fake. Kejriwal asked how registry could be done without regularising the colonies.

AAP functionaries said that the documents were worthless without a notification for change of land use.

Tiwari later said that after a mob of jihadis in Pakistan attacked Nankana Sahib Gurdwara, Sikhs are in terror there. “The CAA has been framed to save such minorities from prosecution but Kejriwal is opposing it because he does not want to protect them,” Tiwari said. Despite attempts to seek reaction from AAP, no comment was available.

PUNE: Commuters using the old Pune-Mumbai highway passing by the newly set up bus terminus of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporations at Wakdewadi are feeling “choked”, courtesy illegal halting of autorickshaws on the service road and parking of two-wheelers on footpaths right outside the facility.The scene outside the terminus was chaotic on Friday afternoon. Autorickshaws were parked outside the entry-exit gates of the terminus. The footpath was occupied by two-wheelers. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporations (MSRTC) buses taking turn from the main road to enter the terminus jostled for space, triggering traffic snarls.The MSRTC temporarily shifted its bus operations to the Wakdewadi depot from the Shivajinagar terminus from January 1 to facilitate the Metro project work. Over 1,000 buses are expected to be operated from the terminus every day. The MSRTC will also take up maintenance of buses arriving at the terminus.Commuters availing the old Pune-Mumbai highway claimed that the MSRTC did not take adequate measures to manage the traffic on the road as well as ensure seamless travel of bus commuters while shifting the bus operations.Yashavant Kamble, a resident of the area, said, “Hundreds of buses are expected to arrive and depart from here. The authorities need to provide adequate infrastructure to manage the movement of buses and commuters. Appointment of controllers and traffic police should be done on priority basis.”Ramesh Bhosale, who arrived at the bus terminus to board a bus, said the location of the terminus was difficult to access. “Moreover, it is not accessible by Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) buses. Commuters are being fleeced by the autorickshaw drivers,” he added.Akshay Kelkar, a regular traveller on the road, said the authorities have not spent a thought on entry and exit of buses to and from the terminus. “Buses enter or exit the terminus every three to four minutes. The movement of these buses hamper the vehicular traffic on the main road,” Kelkar said. He added that the administration would also face a challenge while controlling illegal vendors and presence of private bus operators outside the terminus.Officials in the MSRTC said they were reviewing the situation and initiating steps to introduce improvements to minimize the hardship of commuters.

Thrissur: The CPI-CPM row over the architect of the Kerala’s Land Reforms Act intensified on Saturday with CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran making a scathing attack on those who were trying to undermine the role of late C Achutha Menon in that historic initiative.

Speaking at the 50th anniversary of the implementation of the Land Reforms Act here, Rajendran refrained from making any direct reference on the reported undermining of the role of Menon, who was the party leader and former chief minister. However, it was clear whom he was targeting.

“Even though there were initiatives for redistribution of land even earlier, it was Achutha Menon who made the Act into a reality. Those who are trying to negate his contribution in the land reforms of Kerala are only indulging in the futile task of trying to hide bright sun with an old ‘muram’ (traditional winnowing fan). History must be evaluated objectively and the deserving persons must be given their due credit for their historical contributions,” Rajendran said.

“It was the Achutha Menon government which decided to implement the Land Reforms Act on January 1, 1970. That government could effectively achieve the goals of land redistribution set by the first Communist government in the state in 1957,” Rajendran said.

He said the departed CPI leader E Chandrasekharan Nair had moved an amendment to the Land Reforms Bill when it was being considered by the assembly select committee during the tenure of the seven-party front in which both the CPM and CPI were partners.

The amendment suggested that the Bill must be implemented immediately. However, those who were heading that government pointed out the practical difficulties in implementing it immediately. Subsequently, it was decided to implement the Bill in phases. But those who were heading the government were not keen to implement the land reforms even after those changes, Rajendran said. He said there were several facts available in historical records to recognize the contribution of Menon and CPI in the land reforms in the state. Those who try to read them will understand the real history, he added.

Earlier, in his address, revenue minister E Chandrasekharan also slammed those trying to undermine the contributions of Menon in the implementation Land Reforms Act.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also criticized the efforts to sabotage the contribution of Menon. “The chief minister appears to be feeling some allergy when he had to mention Achutha Menon,” Chennithala told reporters.

AURANGABAD: Aurangabad MP Imtiyaz Jaleel has written to Union sports minister Kiren Rijiju asking him to start a kabaddi training centre for boys at Sports Authority of India ( SAI ) here and requested that the existing kabaddi training centre for girls be kept operational. According to Jaleel, the kabaddi training centre for girls is being shifted to Mumbai, which will make it difficult for the athletes in the region. Athletes from across Marathwada region and nearby districts can benefit from the training centre, said Jaleel.

The MP took up the issue with Rijiju after the Aurangabad District Kabaddi Association wrote to him on December 28. The association, in the letter to Jaleel, wrote that the SAI had two kabaddi training centres in Maharashtra — one in Mumbai and another in Aurangabad. The one in Aurangabad was for boys but it was shut down.

Aurangabad District Kabaddi Association Datta Pathrikar told TOI that after pursuing the matter with the authorities, the kabaddi training centre for girls was opened in Aurangabad. “Many women athletes have benefited from the training centre at SAI, Aurangabad, and have improved their game. The centre is a boon for athletes from rural areas across the Marathwada region and even south India. Now, the SAI has received a letter to shift the women’s hostel to Mumbai,” she said

“This would be a setback for kabaddi players as travelling to Mumbai would be expensive for them,” Pathrikar said. He added that Aurangabad also needs a kabaddi training centre for boys. Virendra Bhandarkar, the SAI Aurangabad director, said that he has now been posted to Guwahati and cannot comment on the issue.

Representative image

PUNE: A criminal in police records was arrested on Friday in an inebriated state for attacking two policemen over a petty dispute at Sainiknagar around 12.05pm.

The arrested man, Suresh Keshav Galfade (40) from Sainiknagar, was creating public nuisance under the influence of liquor.

When the city police control room received a telephone call from bystanders, beat marshal Rajiv Hile and one of his colleagues from the Yerawada police rushed to the spot and appealed to Galfade to maintain peace.

They warned him against creating nuisance, and disturbing the peace and tranquillity of the locality but he refused and picked up a dispute with them.

Senior inspector Yunus Shaikh from the Yerawada police station said, he picked up a dispute with the policemen because he wanted to know if they were real policemen.

“In a fit of anger, he hurled abuses at the policemen, attacked Hile and pushed him to the ground,” Shaikh said.

“Hile suffered minor injuries. Galfade was later taken into custody,” Shaikhadded.

“Investigations revealed that Galfade had a fight with a woman after she refused to give him money for buying liquor,” Shaikh said.

“The control room received a telephone call regarding the incident when he started beating up the woma,” he said.

The beat marshals tried to control the situation but Galfade abused and attacked them as well, the senior inspector said.

“Galfade is a criminal on record of the Pimpri Chinchwad police for his involvement in body offences,” he added.

Chennai: Baidu , China’s largest search engine, is looking forward to working with Indian institutions in future, says its co-founder and CEO Robin Li .

Baidu already has a presence in markets such as Japan, Thailand and Egypt. ""The search will be very different from what is seen today. Once we transform search into a different product, we will be ready to launch it internationally,"" he said during a talk at IIT Madras tech festival Shaastra on Saturday.

""Artificial Intelligence is a big wave. Not every company has resources to develop full-fledged cutting edge technology. We have devoted a lot of resources to open platforms so that everyone can take advantage of that,"" Li said.

AI is also used for public welfare, Li said, adding that they have already found 9,000 missing persons using AI and face recognition technologies in China. It also can be used to help the visually challenged. ""We use AI to help visually impaired people use voice to control air conditioning and other devices.""

Li said video has become the most important content on the internet. ""We used to see text; then more and more images on the Internet. Today, video is the most important form of content on the internet. People’s mindsets are also changing — changing toward video content,"" he said.

AI can make a person immortal as computers can learn the way humans thinks through voice, video and text.

On other trends, he said AI can speed up everything from drug discovery to banking, where virtual assistants can now help people create bank accounts, borrow money and so on.

""In the next ten years, people will be less dependent on mobile phones because wherever they go, there will be surrounding sensors, infrastructure that can answer your questions. You may not be required to pull out your mobile phone every time to find an answer,"" he added.

Search engines would also be very different in future. ""In future, you will not be able to distinguish between search and recommendation. The search engine technology is evolving quickly,"" he said.

389,['5/01/2020'],Draw of lots gives Aurangabad ZP post to MVA,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Newly elected Aurangabad zilla parishad president Meena Shelke (foreground, centre) flashes the victory sign o... Read More

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad ZP elections took an interesting turn on Saturday with the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and BJP candidates securing same number of votes each for the president’s post, forcing draw of lots that went in favour of the Congress nominee.

The election to the ZP president’s post was postponed on Friday, following confusion and clashes over the number of votes both candidates had received as one member had raised the hand twice in favour of each candidate.

Saturday’s election saw Congress’s Meena Shelke and Devyani Dongaonkar, who was supported by the BJP, receiving 30 votes each. Subsequently, a draw of lots was conducted and Shelke was the lucky winner.

The ZP election was a bitter-sweet experience for BJP. Although the party lost the president’s post, its candidate L G Gaikwad defeated MVA’s Shubangi Kaje to clinch the vice-president’s post, elections for which were held on Friday.

However, clinching the vice-president’s post has failed to assuage the BJP which has decided to challenge the Aurangabad ZP president’s election in court.

BJP state vice president Bhagwat Karade told TOI that there was no need for the returning officer to hold fresh elections for the president’s post as the elections had already been conducted on Friday.

“We had an upper hand in the zilla parishad which was proven in the vice president’s election, where our candidate received 32 votes while the MVA nominee got 28. BJP is the largest party in the ZP with 23 members. Disgruntled Sena and Congress members approached us. We formed a group with them and decided to throw our weight behind Devyani Dongaonkar.’’

Following chaos on Friday, returning officer Bhanudas Palwe decided to hold fresh elections for the president’s post on Saturday. He had told reporters that it was hard to count votes amid tremendous commotion in the meeting hall.

Palwe allowed the three members who could not make it to the election venue on Friday to cast their votes on Saturday.

The BJP is the largest party in the 61-member ZP with 23 members, followed by Shiv Sena (17), Congress (16), NCP (3) and a member each belonging to the Democratic Republican Party and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.

Cross-voting happened from both the sides during the election process on Friday. Three candidates were in the fray for the president’s post, including outgoing president Dongaonkar. She earlier represented Sena as the ZP president but rebelled against the safrron party and re-contested the elections with BJP’s support, much to the discomfiture of the Sena leadership in the district. The BJP had fielded Anuradha Chavan for the president’s post. She too pledged her support to Dongaonkar.

Meanwhile, former city MP Chandrakant Khaire came down heavily on newly appointed minister of state Abdul Sattar, dubbing him a traitor saying that six members belonging to Sattar had voted in favour of Dongaonkar (now a Sena rebel).

Khaire said since Sattar was elected on a Sena ticket and made minister, it was his moral responsibility to support the MVA nominee.

Construction work underway at Hamidia hospital 2nd gate

Bhopal: The renovated Hamidia hospital with state of the art facilities is expected to be completed by May this year, if senior officials are to be believed. The expansion of largest tertiary care hospital in the state capital would include completion of two new blocks for medical treatment, hostel and library.

Current phase of Hamidia expansion is pegged at Rs 435.97 crore. A 24x7 work is taking place at Gandhi Medical College (GMC) that would redefine the skyline of the area. Infrastructure development would entail an additional Rs 90 crore, budget for which is awaited.

The expansion would create 1,538 beds in two building blocks towering 13 floors. They would be connected by a bridge – three floors high. Rs 89.21 crore has been allocated for upgrade of GMC which includes a new library and new administrative block. New allocation of funding for up gradation of infrastructure for 250 MBBS seats at GMC has also been approved – all this is expected to a reality by mid-2020. Expansion of Hamidia hospital began in December 2016.

“We expect the shifting of the hospital to new block to be ahead of time,” said Bhopal divisional commissioner, Kalpana Shrivastava. Divisional commissioner is also head of GMC autonomous body which administrates the medical college and its associated hospitals. If achieved it would one of the fastest transformation or expansion of a health care setup in Madhya Pradesh on this scale. Before the expansion, Hamidia hospital strength was 850-beds.

The move would also pave the way for new maternity care building within GMC campus. Currently, the hospital for obstetrics and gynaecology is Sultania hospital, about 5 km away from GMC campus.

Three entries to GMC: Two entries from Royal Market side and one pedestrian way from Fatehgarh would be opened for public at Hamidia hospital. Entry of the hospital has been an issue that has affected emergency vehicles too.

Off late, due to Ijetma market nearby, BMC and police have focussed removing encroachments from Royal market main gate entry to GMC. However, instances of ambulances being stuck in the traffic are a regular site.

A new entry has been proposed, ahead of development and restoration of current main gate. Other passage would be for pedestrian only. The entry is from Fategharh end of GMC.

Earlier this week, during a visit to Hamidia hospital Bhopal north MLA Arif Aqueel asked for opening of closed entry gate of Hamidia hospital. The gate towards Fatehgarh was closed when construction for new blocks began in mid-2017. The proposal has been met with apprehension from engineering consultants.

“Only the pedestrian walkway of the smaller entry would be opened. All safety measures would be in place before the pedestrian way is opened,” said Shrivastava. Off the record, consultants said that there is on-going plaster work on the 13-storey building. A peeling of even a small strand from this level could cause serious damage to a person below. Opening of the gate would also create an easy connect with private pharmacies on the side towards Fatehgarh side.

A man with his child at a ward in Kota’s J K Lon Hospital on Saturday.

JODHPUR: Amid the chaos over the deaths of infants at Kota’s J K Lon Hospital , disturbing figures of similar deaths have emerged from Jodhpur .

A joint report on infant deaths at Umaid Hospital and MDM Hospital in Jodhpur, prepared by the hospitals’ governing organisation, states that a total of 146 deaths (of children) were recorded at the Neonatal Intensive Care and Paediatric ICUs in December.

As per figures obtained from S N Medical College, the governing organisation, a total of 4,689 children were admitted to the two hospitals in December. Of these, 3,002 were infants. During treatment, 146 children, including 102 infants, died.

SN Medical College principal S S Rathore said the child mortality rate came to 3%, which was in keeping with international infant mortality rates.

As per the figures, 47,815 children had been admitted to the hospital in 2019, of which 754 children died, which is 1.57%. But, of these, 5,634 children were admitted to the NICU and ICU in serious condition and all 754 deaths were reported in the NICU and ICU.

Rathore said the paediatric care units for critical patients had been winning first prize for the past two years in succession and this was because “we are doing the best”.

He added that the hospital here has to bear the load of patients from entire western Rajasthan and children are also referred to this hospital from hospitals like AIIMS.

While counting the mortality rate, the hospital administration calculated it factoring in patients admitted to the paediatric wards while the deaths occurred in the NICU and ICU.

Though Rathore denied any shortage of resources to deal with the “pressure”, many senior doctors from the hospital’s paediatric department have been running their own private hospitals and skipping hospital duties. Recently notices had been served on these doctors, including those who had medical shops at their residences, but the situation has not shown any improvement and the absence of senior doctors from the OPD remains a matter of concern.

Requesting anonymity, a Neral police constable said, “The seven persons arrested are locals. A few of the arrested belong to local organisation Sahyadri Pratisthan while others are from Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan. The accused belong to different villages.""

Raigad superintendent of police Anil Paraskar said, “They were produced in a Karjat court and were released on bail. A few of them are members of Shiv Pratisthan Hindustan and while others belong to local organisation. Police are still looking for five to eight more accused.”

Patrick D’Souza

Patrick D’Souza (41), a tutor from Mumbai, secured 100 percentile for the sixth time and the fourth time consecutively, in CAT 2019. D’Souza, who first appeared for CAT in 1996, failed to get an IIM call then.

Soon after, D’Souza pursued an MBA from Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies and then joined a corporate firm. Four years later, the serial CAT taker quit his job to get into teaching. Since then, he has been training a small group of students for CAT.

“Some of my candidates managed over 99 percentile every year. It is very important to stay abreast of current trends in paper patterns and questions. It is a different experience for me every year,” says D’Souza, a Thane resident.

According to D'Souza, CAT is an exam that not only tests an aspirant’s aptitude but also one’s ability to manage pressure in three hours. “I have seen the best failing to manage the pressure and those who remained calm do well. The sections may be constant but the paper is largely unpredictable.”

D'Souza claims that he writes CAT every year to understand the exam. “It helps me to train my students better and review my teaching practices. Writing the paper helps me understand the changes in paper pattern if any, what methods work or don’t work and accordingly teach,” D’Souza adds.

“Many faculty also appear for CAT with the same intention. But training students for the exam and writing it are two different things. Only a few score 99.9 plus and I have managed to crack it four times in a row and six times overall,” added D'Souza, pointing out that CAT does not require you to be brilliant.

“I wasn’t the brightest in the school. Unfortunately, a lot of students prepare for CAT like the way they prepared for exams in school. But that is a wrong method,” said D'Souza.

MUMBAI: While Maharashtra generates the highest GST revenue in the country, collections in the state were Rs 4,683 crore short of the target for the nine-month span between April and December 2019. This means collections are 3.3% behind the target set for the state.While the collections are 9.3% higher than last year, they are still much lower than the 14% growth target set for the state.The shortfall is an indicator of the economic slowdown in the country since GST is a consumption-based tax. Officials say the slowdown in auto and real estate sectors has significantly impacted GST collections in Maharashtra .Consumption in the state, though, picked up during the festive season and helped revive GST collections. For the month of October 2019, GST collections were 22% higher than 2018, said officials. For November 2019, collections are expected to be at least 15% higher than in 2018.“There was a rise in the sale of white goods, except televisions during the festive months. This helped raise GST collections,” said a senior official. Earlier this year, GST on white goods was reduced from 28% to 18%, which may have boosted the volume of sales during the festive season.The Centre’s GST collection target for the state is 1.9 lakh crore for the year. In the nine-month span between April and December, the state should have generated collections totalling Rs 1.41 lakh crore. The collections, though, amounted to Rs 1.4 lakh crore, said officials. In 2018-19, the figure for collections during the same period was Rs 1.25 lakh crore.Officials say it may be difficult to achieve the GST target by March-end. “The monthly collection average till December is Rs 15,232 crore. In order to achieve the target, the monthly average till the end of March will have to be Rs 17,300 crore,” said a senior official.GST is the main revenue earner for the state government. A shortfall in GST collections combined with the delay in compensation cess from the Centre could impact the revenue stream of the cash-strapped state. The Centre is supposed to compensate states for the loss of revenue arising from implementation of GST up to 2022. The state is currently waiting for compensation worth Rs 4,206 crore for the October-November period.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73104993,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-338198,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/till-dec-gst-collections-in-state-rs-4683cr-short-of-target/articleshow/73102314.cms
400,['5/01/2020'],BJP leadership not to bail out strife-ridden BDJS,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: BJP is unlikely to take sides with any of the warring factions within BDJS. The allegations that the BDJS president Thushar Vellappally and its general secretary Subhash Vasu have unleashed against each other, feel BJP leaders, have more financial implications than political ones.

Senior leaders in state BJP have already decided not to make public comments on the developments in the BDJS. The central leadership, contrary to the claims made by Thushar and Vasu, too have refused to intervene. The safe distance that BJP tries to keep from BDJS can be interpreted as a sign of disgust the BJP leadership has developed towards BDJS. Though it tried to preen a political identity, the party has seldom been able to wean itself away from the shadow of SNDP Yogam to which Thushar is the vice-president. Once Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan changed side and started cosying up to the CPM, especially chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the political fortunes of BDJS had gone astray. But then, it was the cordial relationship Thushar had with the BJP central leaders that kept BDJS afloat.

However, the financial controversies that landed Thushar in jail in August 2019 had made irreparable damages in the ties between him and the BJP central leadership. “Thushar used to call on Amit Shah in New Delhi frequently. But since his arrest in the UAE last year, his repeated attempts to meet Shah were not paid back. Last time when he finally met Shah, he had to make himself satisfied with a casual meet up during a BJP function in New Delhi,” a senior BJP leader said.

The BJP leaders in the state were seldom in favour of the central leadership’s decision to take Thushar along with an eye on Ezhava votes. “Now, the central leadership too is convinced about the political impact the BDJS could make. Naturally that party has come to a naught and it’s only a matter of time before it crumbles down,” said another BJP leader.

Sources said that the row over sharing the good fortunes coming from SN Trust-run institutions and other business opportunities has led to the ongoing spar between Thushar and Vadu. The old-time foes of Natesan are also believed to have put their weight behind Vasu, who until recently was the most trusted lieutenant of Natesan. BJP central leadership’s refusal to remove Vasu as the chairman of Spices Board of India underlines BJP’s wait-and-watch attitude.

401,['5/01/2020'],Kerala: Flood-hit government high school gets new lab,"This story is from January 5, 2020

The science lab was opened at the school at Kuttamassery on Friday

KOCHI: Hardly 200 metre away from Periyar, the government high school at Kuttamassery lost most of their infrastructure during the August 2018 floods. The most devastating was the loss of computer and science labs and the library. The school also lost valuable office equipment.

On Friday, a new science lab was opened at the school, with help of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which granted Rs 24 lakh. As a special initiative, IEEE is revamping the centre for visually challenged students of the school.

A special programme to train such students in computer and technology was organized by Chakshumathi trust as part of the event.

The proposal for revamping the flood-hit school was submitted by Cochin University of Science and Technology ( Cusat ) faculty Bijoy Jose, who is the secretary of Kochi subsection of IEEE.

The project was among 35 proposals received that year and six were selected for funding. Techno Unnati, the proposal by Jose, received the highest amount of Rs 24 lakh for building computer and science labs.

Bijoy said the project aims to build computer labs, smart classes and library that were damaged in 2018 Periyar flooding. Part of the fund is also being utilized to provide better facilities for visually challenged students of the school.

C K Aanandan and Ressel P P, who teach at the department of electronics, Cusat, had been providing volunteering support for over a year. “Cusat had been helping the school in student training and we are seeking a higher grant from IEEE headquarters,” said Jose.

The project is being implemented with help of principal Jessy M, headmistress Leelamma K P, teacher Usha Manatt and PTA president Abdul Gafoor. Around 700 students will directly benefit from the lab facilities.

AURANGABAD/NASHIK: The Indian Railways has announced that the Mumbai-Manmad-Mumbai Rajya Rani Express has been extended up to Nanded in via Aurangabad.

The railway ministry, in a letter to the general manager of the Central Railwayand the South Central Railway (SCR)has said that the train numbers 22101 and 22102 Manmad to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) will be extended to up to Huzur Sahib Nanded railway station. The train will start from Nanded at 10pm every day and reach CSMT at 10.07am the next day. On its return journey, it will depart at 6.50pm from CSMT and reach Nanded at 7.20am.

“The Railway Board has issued directives to the Central Railway and the SCR to start running the train on the extended route. Its operations are expected to begin from January 10,” said a senior SCR official.

Passenger associations and regular travellers from the Nashik region are up in arms over the extension of the route. “Since the train timings will suit several passengers from Nanded, they will occupy most seats and won’t allow commuters from Manmad and Nashik to board the train,” alleged Rajesh Fokane, former member of the Divisional Railway Users Consultative Committee (DRUCC). “The train departs from Mumbai at an ideal time. While this helps Nashik residents get home in the evening, and now people heading for Marathwada will also flock to the train as it will help them get home after an overnight journey,” said Sangeeta Shahane, a frequent passenger.

Railway authorities are anticipating friction between passengers from Nashik and those travelling to and from Marathwada. “We will ensure that Railway Protection Force personnel are deployed to thwart attempts to delay the train in any direction,” said a railway official. “There has been a strong need for a new train to Mumbai from Marathwada considering the passenger rush. The traffic congestion faced by the Central Railway was always cited as a major hurdle for starting a new train. It is a welcome move by the top brass of the Indian Railway which has found a way around this issue and extended the route of the Rajya Rani Express,” said Sanjay Gaikwad, a private professional who commutes between Mumbai and Purna every week.

403,['5/01/2020'],"Chennai: Fog over city delays flights, messes with schedules","This story is from January 5, 2020

Visibility was as low as 500 metres at the city airport during a foggy Saturday morning

CHENNAI: Flying to Chennai has turned risky for pilots and passengers as fog disrupted flights at the city airport for the second day on Saturday.

Fog in Bengaluru’s Kempagowda airport around the same time has complicated the issue as it is the alternative airport closest to Chennai but was also not available for diversions.

This means pilots may now have to carry more fuel than the usual to be prepared to handle diversions to Hyderabad. With the Met department saying there could be fog in the region for the next couple of days, pilots will have to carry at least five to six tonnes of additional fuel to last for a diversion to Hyderabad airport.

“Pilots often carry three tonnes of additional fuel to handle diversions to Bengaluru but now more fuel must be carried. As a rule, pilots should carry fuel enough to reach Hyderabad as weather conditions are not ideal early in the morning in January to use Bengaluru as an alternate landing city,” said an airline official.

“This looks like freakish weather. Visibility usually dips closer to Pongal week. But this year, it has started becoming foggy early in the month. This will be an added blow because pilots are anticipating delays in airports in Delhi too,” said a pilot.

As arrivals are delayed, departures too get affected. On Saturday, planes could not taxi at the usual speed to reach the end of the runway for take-off because visibility was at 500 metres to 550 metres before dawn. This slowed down other departures. Though Chennai airport has airport operations control centre and collaborative decision making to communicate about ground delays to airlines, these are not efficiently linked to the Air Traffic Flow Management System, which foresees air congestion at airports well in advance. Though the city airport was enveloped with fog, most of the diverted flights came close to the airport before being diverted on Saturday.

An AAI official said in most of the cases, airlines allow their flights to proceed to the airport despite alerts about poor weather in the hope that the visibility will clear by the time the aircraft approaches the city for landing.

404,['5/01/2020'],Drone monitoring tech by Bhopal boy wins global laurels,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Vibhu Tripathi and Ayush Jindal

BHOPAL: A demonstration for tracking low altitude aerial vehicles including drones by a Bhopal-based start-up has been adjudged fourth amongst 142 entries from 51 countries at an event in Toulouse, France, according to a press release from Bhopal smart city development corporation limited (BSCDCL).

The duo, RGPV student Vibhu Tripathi and his partner Ayush Jindal who go by call-sign ‘Vizzbee’ were ranked 4th in Global Earth Observation 2019. Last year, a top Asian investor in new tech Zeroth purchased a 6% stake in the start-up. They were part of 30 start-ups in Asia in which the Hong Kong-based accelerator would invest $1.2 lakh (about Rs 82 lakh).

Vizzbee is an improvement from their early stage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning for the project. The new line of improvement deals with safety for low altitude aerial vehicles. According to Airbus, there will be an addition of aerial vehicles, both manned and unmanned in the current airspace and since air traffic controllers are already running at their maximum capacity, said Tripathi.

“There is a need of unmanned traffic management and routing system that can handle the operations, which considers the safety of not just the vehicle, but the area on top of which it flies,” he added. Last year, Bhopal collector Tarun Pithode had announced for a special cash prize for start-ups that could integrate GPS-based technology to identify the number of drones operating in the state capital.

Currently, Tripathi and Jindal’s idea is being tested for multiple use cases such as medical delivery for hospitals and search and rescue operations. The uniqueness of the project has promoted an invite from Airbus headquarters.

The project is a shot in the arm for B-nest, which has found central government funding hard to flow, said sources.

Ayush Jindal, the co-founder and an IIT-Delhi graduate (2019) has been working on autonomous robots since last two years. He is an expert in motion planning and robot navigation algorithms. Tripathi, a graduate from RGPV Bhopal, is a drone enthusiast. He has developed various drone applications ranging from search and rescue emergency response and centralised drone swarming.

These graceful old buildings, built across decades – all the way back to the 1920s - showcased a wide variety of architectural styles and played some great movies. History enthusiast Babu Ajaz is known as the Calendar Man among Bengaluru’s online history buffs. Every year, this Whitefield resident brings out an online calendar with an old Bangalore theme. This year Ajaz turned his sights on these theatres.“Many of us miss our old Bangalore and to see black and white photos of the bygone places brings both happiness and melancholy,” says Ajaz.The photographs have been mainly sourced from the Facebook group Bangalore – Photos from a Bygone Age. They include an image from the 1960s of the bygone Liberty Theatre on MG Road playing Mughal-e-Azam. There’s also the Paramount theatre, which was built in the 1920s in the City Market area. It was where the first Kannada film Sati Sulochana was screened on its release in 1934. Paramount made way for new structures a few years ago.Other photographs include the Elgin in Shivajinagar, the Opera on Brigade Road, Plaza on MG Road, Alankar on KG Road, Bharat talkies on JC Road, Central in Seshadripuram, Swastik near Majestic and Ajanta in Ulsoor.Two of the showcased movie halls that are still functional: the landmark Everest theatre in Fraser Town near the Bengaluru East railway station that screens Hindi and English movies and Sharada cinema in Nagarathpet which has been refurbished and is operational.“The photographs of the cinema halls bring in a lot of memories of younger days connected to each hall and the film that I have watched there. Those were the days when life and entertainment revolved around cinema halls in our beautiful city,” says Ravishankar Neelam, a Bengaluru cinema history enthusiast, who holds a rare collection of ticket stubs from many bygone cinema halls of the city.As for Ajaz, every year demands pour in from netizens to convert the online calendar into a hardcopy, and make it available for sale, but he isn’t interested. “My answer is simple.

Deputy CM Sachin Pilot addresses media in Kota on Saturday.

KOTA: It struck Shubham Hada almost immediately that the ICU to which he had brought his infant of two days with a respiratory disorder had no window panes. The temperature would plummet to about 3°C at night and bring with it gusts of wind that cut through a flimsy blanket to gnaw at the bone. His baby may just have shivered to death at Kota 's JK Lon Hospital, one among the 107 children to have perished till now since the start of December 2019. The new year brought no cheer. Seven kids died within the first four days of January.

“My child was exposed to biting chill,” Hada said as he mourned with family at his Vigyan Nagar house on Saturday. A state government report has now confirmed that many of the infants died from hypothermia, an emergency condition where the body temperature falls below 95°F. The normal is 98.6°F.

On the night of January 3, it was Mohammad Vakil’s heart that turned cold. Waiting on his baby, he watched another slip on the hospital bed nearby. “The attendant realised that the oxygen cylinder was empty. He immediately alerted the nursing staff, but it was too late. The infant couldn’t survive.” The country has now suddenly woken up to the horrors of the Rajasthan hospital, but thousands of parents have seen their children die because even basic amenities and gadgets weren’t provided to doctors and nursing staff.

Alarm bells rang in 2018, too, when a social audit of the hospital revealed that 22 out of 28 nebulisers were not working. Of 111 infusion pumps, used to administer medicines to infants, 81 were non-functional. Only 6 of 20 life-support machines could be used. In short, the bulk of equipment was worthless.

In 2019, 963 infants had died in the hospital out of 16,915 admissions. In 2018, it was 1,005 from 16,436. On average, the figure has been 1,100 each year since 2014.

Doctors and nurses -- angry, helpless and often at the receiving end of attendants’ ire and frustration -- take pains to explain their struggle to bring down the mortality rate. But not only are they severely understaffed, they have appalling gadgets, much of it in disuse, to go to in times of an emergency. The infrastructure is crippling. It’s routine to tie up three babies to a bed, windows are gaping holes without glass, ventilators are dead and pigs roam around merrily. Sometimes patients are in danger of being bitten by rodents. Hygiene is as bad as it can get.

“They have now closed the holes the rats made to enter the NICU,” said Manish Kumar of Sultanpur in UP, whose baby is admitted here. He said it with great relief and obligation.

Padma, 25, lost her six-month-old son Tejas on December 23. She said she is setting aside her grief to take on the hospital for its negligence so that “no other mother should have to face” what she did. She has gone to the government demanding that she be compensated for the money she had to borrow for her baby’s treatment.

Enraged at the staff, she told TOI that their behaviour with attendants was “merciless and rude”. She recounted how guards at the NICU ward would often remark that no child would come out alive. “I had already spent close to Rs 80,000 in private hospitals before I took Tejas to JK Lon on December 22. Suffering from pneumonia , he died the next day,” she said.

The building itself offers no succour – or even hope. Dilapidated, the open wiring is old and unconcealed. Pipes leak at many places and there are dirty stains on its walls. However, hospital authorities said they are in the process of improving the facilities. ""The public works department has submitted a report in which it stated that there is a requirement of Rs 1.35 crore for repairs,” said Dr Suresh Dulara, medical superintendent at the hospital. “We have forwarded it to the district collector. If we get the funds, it will help us improve things around here.”

The hospital has a total of 63 ICU beds for its paediatric and neo-natal units. The mother and child facility has 471 beds in all and caters to not only patients from Rajasthan but also from MP and UP, often the poorest who have nowhere else to go but JK Lon.

AURANGABAD: Pankaja Munde , the beleaguered former rural development minister who had lost her Parli seat in the 2019 polls, received another setback on Saturday as she lost both the zilla parishad president and vice president’s post to the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which was led by her estranged cousin and Cabinet minister Dhanajay Munde.

The MVA had fielded NCP’s Shivkanya Shirsath for the president’s post while Bajrang Sonwane was its vice-president nominee. The BJP fielded Yogini Thorat and Bharat Kale respectively for the president and vice-president’s posts respectively.

Sources in the NCP said that the MVA nominees received 32 votes each while the BJP candidates got 21 each. “The results might be declared on January 13, subject to the outcome of high court verdict in case of five ZP members.”

Pankaja’s younger sister and Beed MP Preetam Munde, told reporters that the BJP already had 19 members and an independent and got its president and vice-president elected earlier with the help other members, so it can’t be said that the BJP lost the numbers. She as well as BJP MLC Suresh Dhas asserted that Shiv Sena members, who earlier supported the BJP to win the ZP, couldn’t do so due to the changed in the political equation at the state-level and had to toe the MVA line.

Meanwhile, Pankaja tweeted: “It’s an impact of Aghadi in the state. Last night, the Sena has expressed its inability to come along despite their wishes. Participating in the election as a part of democratic process. Otherwise, the outcome is clear.”

Sources in the administration who conducted the poll process said that as per the high court direction, they conducted the election and would submit the outcome before the HC on January 13 in a sealed envelope. “The petition by five disqualified ZP members is pending in the high court, which would come up for hearing on January 13,” an official said on condition of anonymity.

TNN

Chennai: Though India has abysmal number of qualified psychiatrists, resulting in a condition where the ratio is one mental health professional for 1 lakh people, government medical colleges do not have adequate psychiatry seats at post-graduate level, said a PIL in Madras high court. One in every 20 people in India suffer from depression nearly and 1% of population in India has high suicidal risk, it said.

Citing rapid increase in mental health cases like depression, anxiety disorder and suicidal tendency among people, the PIL filed by advocate E Ranganayaki of Chennai wanted the high court to order increase in the number of student intake in psychiatry and psychology courses, and to incorporate mental health and wellness programmes like yoga in school curriculum.

A division bench of Justice M Sathyanaryanan and Justice R Hemalatha, before which the issue came up for admission on Friday, issued notice to union and state governments. The case will come up again for hearing on February 26.

In her PIL, relying on media reports, including those appeared in TOI, and surveys by Nimhans and Assocham, Renganayaki said there was a crucial need to bridge the gap between patients and mental health care professionals. There is critical need for more number of practising professionals in the field of mental health, she said, adding that in most government medical colleges the student intake is 2 to 4 in psychiatry stream.

The survey said children and adolescents are vulnerable to mental disorders in the age group 13-17 years was 7.3% and nearly equal in both genders. Nearly 9.8 million of young Indians aged between 13-17 years are in need of active interventions the petitioner said prevalence of mental disorders was nearly twice as much in urban metros as compared to rural.

Citing union ministry of home affairs report, the PIL said Tamil Nadu reported the highest number of police personnel committing suicide in the country, and added that 166 police personnel ended their lives in Tamil Nadu between 2010 and 2014, followed by 161 in Maharashtra and 61 in Kerala.

The PIL wanted authorities to create awareness about mental health among children and said including it in school curriculum will help equip students to with knowledge and skills to be aware of the disease and the skills to manage it at young age itself.

Chennai: Imagine a government law college where the post of principal is lying vacant since 2004, and physical education teacher vacancy lying unfilled since 2000. Also, of the sanctioned faculty strength of 18, only nine are available to teach students. This is Dr Ambedkar Government Law College in Puducherry for you.

The issue came to light when a student’s father moved the Madras high court to postpone the first semester examination saying the five-year LLB course students had not been taught much during the year. The examination, scheduled to commence on Monday will, however, go on as the court has refused to stay the examination. It, however, directed the authorities concerned to furnish details of the vacancy in faculty positions by January 8.

Justice P D Audikesavalu passed an interim direction to this effect on a petition filed by a Puducherry-based advocate, S Subramanian, whose son is studying first year LLB in the college.

The petition said though the first year classes commenced with a lecture on August 23, 2019, regular classes began only at the end of September. Not having enough faculty members in the college deprives students of the right to equip themselves for the semester examinations, the petition said, adding that even temporary faculty members were not available due to a low salary offered of Rs 10,000 a month.

Stating that the college has to comply with the mandatory rules of the Bar Council of India under the Advocates Act, which clearly mentions the requirement of faculty and other infrastructure , the petitioner said the college had admitted students for the academic year 2019-20 without complying with the rules.

He prayed for a direction to restrain the college from conducting the semester examinations for first year LLB students and a direction to fill the vacancies of faculty members within a time frame.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University has cancelled a third semester BTech computer science exam, held on December 31.

The examination on ‘switching theory and logic’ was cancelled after it came to the varsity’s notice that most of the questions included in the question paper were the same ones used for the internal examination held in College of Engineering, Trivandrum recently.

“The new date for the examination will be announced later. The syndicate sub-committee on examination has been asked to look into the incident and submit a report. Strict action would be taken against those responsible for the goof up,” said university vice chancellor K M Rajasree, on Saturday.

A member of the university academic council and a senior faculty in computer science engineering have been included in the enquiry committee. The committee has been asked to submit its report in seven days.

412,['5/01/2020'],Call of the city leaves behind empty villages,"This story is from January 5, 2020

BENGALURU: Suddenly in a burst of renewed interest, the media recently trained the spotlight on the Japanese village of Nagoro. The New York Times, The Straits Times and some websites published news features about this “abandoned village” that has no shop, school or railway station and the oldest resident is aged 50-plus. It’s nearly two decades since the last child was born there.

Yet Nagoro isn’t uninhabited in a sense. Giving company to the 30-odd human residents are over 350 life-sized dolls stuffed with cotton and straw, all located at strategic spots. Road workers taking a smoke-break, school students in a classroom, a man slouching on a couch, villagers gathered on the porch of a store, farmers working in fields are all cloth effigies, many of them resembling elders who have passed away. It all started with Tsukimi Ayano (70), a crafts hobbyist who came back from Osaka in 2002 to take care of her father. Her first doll was a scarecrow that looked like him. Over the years, given the dwindling numbers, more dolls had to be made and there are haunting images of these in Fritz Schumann’s 2014 documentary film, “Valley of Dolls”.

Tourists and visiting writers have described the ambience varyingly as creepy and charming. The dolls seem to be in a performance, their zombie eyes keeping tabs on everyone. Ayano likes to give the dolls a hint of expression: if she tugs the strings at the mouth, they smile. But sadly, not too long; they “live” only for three or four years.

Nagoro is perhaps the most glaring example of demographic crisis in Japan, but some would like to pin the blame on the allure of big cities. Isn’t it reflective of the great exodus to cities? It’s happening everywhere – from China to India to Latin America. And surely around Bengaluru and in many districts of northern Karnataka where we hear of weekdays in villages inhabited only by the old, the infirm, children and a few women.

I asked Pico Iyer, writer, novelist and Japanophile, whether he’d buy this theory. He said: “To me the main question is not one of geography so much as orientation; in other words, I’m less concerned with where humans live than with what values they live by.

“In my adopted home, Japan, more and more people are moving to the cities, but in the cities they live with a strong sense of neighbourhood and connectedness, almost as if they were still in the countryside. Japan strikes me as an urban culture guided by traditional values, very much a place wearing 21st century clothes, but sustaining 8th century souls--like an old man in a Planet Hollywood T-shirt, as I write in my Beginner’s Guide to Japan, who is up-to-the-minute, urban and cool, but no less old or Japanese for that.

Pico feels sad and wistful at the image of villages emptying out and the fact that Japan last year saw fewer than 900,000 births for the first time in its recorded history. But for him the bigger problem “which I’m sure you witness in India, is a hundred different communities all living side-by-side in Mumbai or Delhi or Bangalore, and a growing inequality between those in the high-rises and those on the streets.” He believes we’re moving towards a massive global city – not a village -- which becomes a “literal truth in the circumstances we’re witnessing”.

But there’s no stopping the migrant. “It’s hard to legislate dreaming, and in our media-connected world, every last villager across the planet can see, every moment, images of what looks to be a better life in Mumbai or New York or London. The main challenge that brings to us is that we have different kinds of neighbours and we have to think freshly about them,” he says.

In a ritualised society like Japan, where the traditional and the modern aren’t binaries, change doesn’t surprise anyone. Pico lives in the bustling suburb of Nara, south of Kyoto, where the calendar seems “still largely determined by the agricultural festivals of a village: ceremonies to greet the last harvest of the year, ceremonies to thank the gods for a good harvest, ceremonies to propitiate the gods for a good harvest next year, the lighting of the 5000 stone lanterns that lead to the shrine, and so on.” All this, he says, makes them feel, “even while living in a 1970s suburb of a pretty big city, we’re still basically around the rice-fields of centuries ago.”

Not all cultures accept contradiction as a way of life. Not everywhere are people so stoical about the impermanence of things. The Japanese, it seems, could bask in the comfort of convenience stores and acknowledge the neon winks of entertainment hubs with as much the same spirit of belief in Omikuji – paper strips of fortune tied to trees at shrines. With such equanimity, the countryside needn’t necessarily become a museum of despair.

Kochi: Operation Breakthrough — a project to prevent waterlogging in Kochi — could be reduced to a cosmetic exercise if it does not include the remit for a drainage master plan, which will take into account the topography and other features of the city.

According to revenue officials, no funds have been earmarked for a drainage master plan. “It is learnt that there are plans for a drainage master plan under the Smart City project. So, we have not earmarked funds for the same,” said an official associated with Operation Breakthrough. “We will be focusing on cleaning drains and a couple of canals , and eviction of encroachments where it is unavoidable. We have identified contractors for 25 of the 33 works to be carried out in the first phase,” the official said. The state government has allotted Rs 10 crore for the first phase of the project, the full implementation of which is expected to cost Rs 60 crore.

Going by the website of the Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML), the agency to implement Smart City projects, there is no proposal to prepare a drainage master plan. Even if a new proposal is included, it won’t be easy to get it approved. As per the existing schedule, all Smart City projects will have to be awarded by January 31. It takes at least three months to prepare a detailed project report.

According to experts, Operation Breakthrough sans a drainage master plan wouldn’t serve the purpose. “Authorities should have availed the service of competent agencies or persons for preparing a master plan. If we start work on the basis of a master plan, we will be able to find lasting solutions to the waterlogging in the city,” said architect S Gopakumar, president of Better Kochi Response Group. KJ Sohan, former mayor of Kochi, echoed the view. “Without a drainage master plan, Operation Breakthrough won’t be able to do much for avoiding waterlogging in the city,” Sohan said.

As part of Operation Breakthrough, engineers and supervisors with various departments, studied different parts of the city. On the basis of site inspections, they have suggested remedies for avoiding waterlogging in each area. Unfortunately, no official from the revenue and district survey departments was part of the team. As a result, identifying encroachments and evictions on such land may prove to be a hard nut for authorities to crack.

AURANGABAD: Rotegaon and Lasur railway stations will fall on the extended route of Rajya Rani express, which will now run from Mumbai to Nanded . While the notification issued earlier had skipped these two stations, a revised communication from the Railway Board has incorporated these two key stations. TOI had advocated the inclusion of Rotegao and Lasur stations while highlighting the demand among passengers to extend the train’s route till Nanded. The revised communication mentions mentions eight stops, including Rotegao and Lasur, which are: Purna, Parbhani, Manvat Road, Selu, Partur, Jalna and Aurangabad.

Activist Gautam Nahata credited the success of sanctioning additional stops to the different MPs and MLAs of the region along with other railway activists. “It is a good move by the railway authorities to pay heed to the demand of passengers and incorporate additional stops,” he said.

The stop at Ankai has been dropped in the revised notification. “Ankai railway station comes under Bhusaval division of the Central Railway. Located in Yeola taluka of Nashik district, it is close to the temple town of Shirdi . The revised route map of the Rajya Rani express eliminated this station as few more stations were added,” a senior SCR official said, adding that a balance had to be maintained between the number of stops and the total journey time in keeping with the existing rail traffic.

AURANGABAD: A brick-lined well , believed to have been constructed during the Satavahana period, has been discovered at Ter in Osmanabad district, around 250km from here. The well, which has unique brickwork, was discovered last month during excavation work being carried out for the construction of a building, where a museum in Ter is planned to be relocated, authorities said.

“The Ramalingappa Lamature Museum in Ter is set to be shifted to another location. The state government has started constructing a new building for that and the well belonging to the Satavahana period (230BC to 200AD) was discovered during the excavation on December 14,” said Amol Gote, assistant curator of the department of archaeology.

“The well has a unique brickwork. Also, the bricks are larger when compared to those found earlier in Ter from the Satavahana period,” he said. According to archaeology department authorities, the bricks found during the excavation in Ter in the past were 40cm long, 20cm wide and 7cm thick. “But the bricks used in the construction of this well have different measurements: 45cm in length, 24cm in width and 9cm in thickness,” officials said.

After the discovery of the well, the archaeology department has demarcated the area to carry out a scientific excavation. “The arrangement of bricks in the well gives us an idea that the work was executed during the Satavahana era. The vertical and horizontal arrangements of bricks is unique here. While one layer is vertical, three others are horizontal,” authorities said.

Umesh Bagade, head of the history department at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, said that the bricks are vital clue in deciding the period of history of any structure. “Along with Ter, present-day Paithan in Aurangabad district and Bhokardan in Jalna district were prominent cities during the rule of Satavahana dynasty. While Paithan, then known as Pratishthan was the capital of the dynasty, Ter was also a major centre as it was on the route of international trade. The wells and rivers were the only source of water during those days and therefore the well found at Ter appears to be intact as it was built well,” he said.

The archaeology department during the excavation work carried out so far, has reached the depth of around three meters. History scholar Revansiddha Lamture, elaborating on Ter’s significance as a trade centre during the Satavahana period, said, “Commodities from different regions were brought at Ter, from where they would be sent as far as Rome via Paithan (Aurangabad) and Bharuch (Gujarat),” he said. Located around 22km from Osmanabad, Ter, which was called ‘Tagar’ in ancient times, is believed to have hosted one of the oldest civilisations in the country and was populated during the pre-Satavahana, Satavahana, post-Satavahana and Vakataka periods. Ter place, however, was at peak of its glory during the Satavahana rule.

Praniti Shinde

KOLHAPUR: Solapur Congress workers, miffed over non-inclusion of Praniti Shinde into the state cabinet, on Friday burned the effigy of AICC general secretary Mallikarjun Kharge .

Despite not getting permission from police to carry out the protest, the workers, mostly youths, gathered at Hutatma Chowk in the morning and demanded Kharge’s removal from the party.

Youth Congress president Ambadas Kalgute blamed Kharge, who is in-charge of Maharashtra, for neglecting Praniti — daughter of senior Congress functionary and former home minister Sushilkumar Shinde.

Several Congress workers have resigned from their posts to register protest against her non-inclusion in the cabinet. The party, however, is divided into two groups over the issue.

One group feels that workers should not resign and take up the issue to the high command, while another is of the view that the high command would not pay attention without resignation.

On Wednesday, the workers staged a day-long peaceful agitation out outside the party office. They alleged that Praniti was being deliberately neglected when new comers and first time MLAs are given opportunity.

Many Congress workers are of the view that Praniti’s name was dropped at the last moment. Many workers were on their way to Mumbai to attend the swearing-in ceremony when they came to know that Praniti would not be part of the cabinet.

A youth Congress worker had written a letter with his blood to interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi to press for the demand. He had also pointed out that it is Praniti who had kept the party alive in Solapur district.

418,['5/01/2020'],World War II POW’s son make emotional trip from Milan to Bengaluru,"BENGALURU: The North African Campaign, fought between the Allies and Axis powers in the World War II took place between June 1940 and May 1943. It raged across Libya and Egypt, Morocco and Algeria and Tunisia. The campaigns fought across the deserts of Libya and Egypt – generally called the Desert War or the WesternDesert campaign, rank among the most famous battles of the war – with a rich cast of characters: Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, aka the Desert Fox, General Archibal Wavell - who would later become Lord Wavell, the Viceroy of India who struggled with Winston Churchill, Ettore Baldassarre, the head of Italy ’s fabled Ariete Armoured division, Field Marshal Claude Auchineck - and many others, whose stories have been told many times in many formats.But there were others - hundreds of thousands of others - normal soldiers who fought and died for their countries and their governments, each of whom had a unique and interesting story as well. One of those others was Roberto Rovellini.Italy in the WarWorld War II officially began with the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. But Italy officially declared war on England and France in June 1940 - and invaded France. The campaign was called the Battle of the Alps, and it was 21-year-old Rovellini’s first major engagement. He was part of a motorised division of the ground troops and served as an army messenger - riding a motorcycle across frontiers.After the Battle of the Alps, Italy’s focus shifted to Africa. Within the week of Italy entering the war, the British seized an Italian fort in Libya. In retaliation, Mussolini ordered the Italian forces to invade Egypt – which was in British hands at the time. The young Rovellini was part of the forces sent to North Africa. Mussolini had instructed his generals to carve a path through Egypt, but the Italian army was hampered by the lack of transport and weak supporting arms. In January, 1940, the British launched their first offensive and a joint force of British and Australian troops captured the port of Tobruk. They also took close to 200,000 Italian prisoners of war (POWs) as part of the Desert war. Roberto Rovellini was one of them.Imprisoned in BangaloreRovellini was first sent to POW camp in Ceylon (Sri Lanka). From there, he was moved to another camp – this time at Hebbal, here in Bengaluru. “Nearly, 60,000 Italian including soldiers and officers, captured in war, where brought to Bangalore in 1941 and were locked up in camps here,” says Stefano Rovellini, Roberto’s son.The 65-year-old Stefano had heard stories of his father’s days as a prisoner of war in Bangalore – and made up his mind to retrace his father’s footsteps. “My father used to tell me bedtime stories of this beautiful city – he was here for six years before he was sent home,” he says.Stefano, his wife Domenica Battaglia, his daughter Giulia and son Simone arrived in Bengaluru on Wednesday for what they call an “emotional and memorable trip of a lifetime”. “It took a long series of steps and requests through the strangest channels to get here,” said Stefano.Not many people remember that India was the location for several POW camps in World War II. Thousands of captured troops were held in camps across India – in Bangalore, Dehradun, Ramgarh and Bhopal. In Bangalore alone, there were eight camps spread across what were then the outskirts of the city, mainly Hebbal and Jakkur.The ReturnRoberto Rovellini was a prisoner here till the famous Armistice of Cassibile was signed between Kingdom of Italy and Allied forces on September 3, 1943 in Sicily and made public the following week.“The treaty was a boon to many of the prisoners as the British offered limited freedom for the POWs to move around in a restricted manner as long as they were willing to cooperate with their captors. My grandfather took up the offer – and was allowed the freedom to go out of the Bangalore prison camp,” says Giulia, recalling the stories her grandfather told her.Not all prisoners accepted the amnesty, and Roberto Rovellini’s acceptance of the British offer upset many of his fellow prisoners. But there were a few others who did take it up, and the British put them to work. “My papa and many others were assigned work and he was part of the team that was involved in setting up the 515 Army Base Workshop in 1943. POWs built the place and began working there post 1943,” said Stefano whose father began repairing heavy machinery and tank engines at the city workshop which still stands on Artillery Road serving the Indian Army .Roberto Rovellini worked at the Army Base Workshop till 1946. By this time, World War II had ended, and the prisoners began returning home. Roberto got his turn in July 1946, when he was sent to Bombay to board a ship for Naples.After being reunited with his mother and his siblings in Piacenza, Roberto started refurbishing automobiles and worked as a car mechanic. He got married and had three children. “He would often talk about his time here, and he would always talk of coming back to Bangalore one day,” says Stefano.Sadly, that return never took place. Roberto passed away in 2016 – at the ripe old age of 97.The Passage to IndiaBut Stefano decided that the family would have to visit the Army Base in the city that his father had talked so often about. Last year, the Rovellini clan wrote to the Indian Consulate in Milan seeking permission to visit the Bengaluru Army Base where Rovellini senior worked. Following a series of procedures and an official interview with the consulate in Milan, the family was granted permission and liaison officers of the Indian Army were assigned to guide them. Soon after, Stefano and his family arrived in Bengaluru on New Year’s Day and visited the 515 Army Base on Thursday morning.“This visit is what we have been waiting for many years. Sadly, Roberto is not with us. But we witnessed and experienced the very places he had lived and worked. It is so overwhelming,” said Domenica, her eyes brimming. An equally emotional Stefano also took his family members to the St. Mary’s Basilica in Shivajinagar where Rovellini senior was part of the church choir along with other Italians. “He learned English in Bangalore, sang at the church and often visited the cinemas. Even though we have come here for the first time, this city brings a special feeling in us and and will be part of us for many years to come,” Stefano said.More to ComeThe Rovellini’s visit appears to be closely watched by children of other World War II veterans – and could be a precursor to more families visiting the prisons of their parents or grand parents. On the Facebook group “POW. Italians, in India, prisoners of the British”, Stefano wrote “Today was a very emotional day for me and my family...We managed to cross this gate, greeted with great courtesy by Colonel Kapir Sharma, commander of the Base, in Bangalore. Harry’s Barracks 525 Workshop Army Base was where my father Roberto spent most of his imprisonment... He worked and lived in this place with another hundred compatriots. A place that, unique among the Bangalore camps, has remained practically intact. The Commander and his staff did not know the fact that Italians contributed to giving birth to what is now a vast arsenal. We have reopened a page of history.”",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/world-war-ii-pows-son-make-emotional-trip-from-milan-to-bengaluru/articleshow/73101759.cms

KOCHI: When Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) drew up a plan to widen and beautify five major canals in the city, National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (Natpac) was entrusted with preparation of a detailed project report. As per its report, the canals were to be widened to 40 metres for facilitating smooth navigation on them. The project was then handed over to Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL).

They entrusted a Netherlands-based agency to implement the project. “Earlier, Natpac had conducted a land acquisition survey. As per their report, the canals were to be widened to 40 metres. As per the current decision, the maximum width required for the canals is 20.5 metres. Now, we have to just validate the survey conducted by Natpac. So, we are all set to entrust chief hydrographer, Government of Kerala, to conduct a validation survey,” an official associated with the project said. “Officials with chief hydrographer’s office conducted site inspection. They will be give us the quotation for the work carried out soon,” the official said.

It was after considering the difficulties in removing encroachments that authorities decided to cut the maximum width of the canals to 20.5 metres. As of now, maximum width of major canals like Thevara-Perandoor and Edappally is around 10 metres. The Thevara-Perandoor canal is 60 metres wide at many points. Rampant encroachments have shrunk the width of the canals over the years.

Though the plan was to prepare an outline of the work by December 31, authorities couldn’t complete it. “Because of the Christmas and New Year holidays, the pace of the work dropped. Now, we will be expediting the work. We will be completing the outline in the next ten days,” sources said.

Under the project, five major canals — Edappally, Chilavannoor, Thevara-Perandoor, Thevara and Market canals — will be rejuvenated and made navigable. The Rs 1,365 crore project will also facilitate smooth flow of water from canals and drains in the city into the major canals. KMRL authorities are learned to have taken measures to rehabilitate those residing on the banks of these canals.

CHENNAI: Using artificial intelligence for diagnosis and telemedicine services for treatment along with Ayushman Bharath programme will improve cancer diagnosis and treatment outcomes in India, which is reeling under a shortage of doctors, said World Health Organisation chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan .

Over the past three days, experts have been discussing how artificial intelligence is proving to be more effective in spotting breast cancer from mammograms than expert radiologists. AI outperformed specialists by detecting cancers that radiologists missed in the images and also junked features they falsely flagged as possible tumours.

“If AI can make breast screening more effective and ease the burden on health services where radiologists are in short supply, it will help systems diagnose women in early stages of the disease and improve treatment,” she said, delivering the Dr S Krishnamurthi Centenary Memorial Oration on ‘Cancer in India: Challenges and Opportunities.’ The oration was organised by the Cancer Institute, Adyar.

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women after cervical cancer. The incidence of breast cancer is increasing, particularly among women in urban areas of Tamil Nadu. “In the rural areas, screening of cervical cancer has substantially improved with health workers screening women with simple tests using acetic acid. Besides radiology, state can use tele-pathology for confirmation as well,” she told a hall filled with doctors, medical students and social workers.

Further, if single dose of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine proves to be as good as two or three injections at preventing cervical cancer in the ongoing research, it may make the World Health Organization’s goal of eliminating cervical cancer easier, she said. The vaccine is now given in at least two doses, but a single dose vaccine will make it easier for countries like India.

While an Indian pharamaceutical company is in the final stages of clinically testing a HPV vaccine, research programmes in India should focus on better collection of data through cancer registries across the country and interpretation of data for stronger policies, she said. For instance, effective policies to bring down tobacco use can bring down incidence of cancer substantially. Now, tobacco use is considered the leading risk factor for cancers in India, besides dietary factors, alcohol, air pollution and obesity. “Though we have a robust cancer registry, there is no data coming from states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh,” said.

She further added that the Centre’s promise to invest more money in research should be directed to understand the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer.

NAGPUR: Four VNIT students are among the seven probable city toppers in Common Admission Test ( CAT ) held primarily for entry to Indian Institute of Managements (IIMs) and other premier B-schools.

Sushant Thombre (VNIT) emerged first with a percentile of 99.99 followed by Sri Ram Mahalingam (VNIT) at 99.97, Yash Gupta (BITS, Pilani) at 99.57, Shuvendu Ranabijuli (VNIT) at 99.54, Kaustabh Chatterjee (VNIT) at 99.44, Pranay Gupta at 99.36 and Vedant Vyas (both RCOEM) at 99.26.

Mehul Zunzunwala, who runs a well-known CAT coaching institute in the city, cautioned students to be careful while selecting mentors at this stage. “The level of competition will increase significantly now as the best will be competing against better than the best ones,” he said.

He said students will now be assessed in various areas like essay-writing, group discussions, group exercise, case studies and personal interviews based on the B-school.

Zunzunwala has planned a month long training to ensure that all students who have got calls get a final selection in the IIMs and top B schools.

Representative image

MUMBAI: After an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) attached to the Local Arms (LA) misplaced a loaded magazine with 30 bullets in Bandra on January 3, officers from the Khar and Bandra police station went on a five-hour hunt till they found them.

After misplacing the 30 live rounds at a bus depot near Taj Lands End in Bandra (west), ASI Rajan Dhule rushed to the Bandra police station around 9.45pm to report that his bag containing the weapons had been stolen. Dhule was on protection duty for Bhai Jagtap, or MLC Ashok Arjunrao, at his Carter Road residence, when the incident occurred.

Dhule told the Bandra police that he did not have a clear picture on how the bag was stolen and where it happened. Assistant commissioner of police Dattatray Bhargude and senior inspector Vijaylaxmi Hiremath, supervised by deputy commissioner of police (IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya, led a team of officers who went on a search for the bag. Five hours later, around 2am on January 4, the bullets were found at the Bandra bus depot near Taj Lands End.

According to the Bandra police, Dhule was under the influence of alcohol while on duty. They have sent a default report to the commissionerate, for further action. “He was sent for protection duty on Friday. On finding that the MLC and his family were not at home, he left and went drinking. He has been sent on protection duty twice before as well,” said a police officer.

“On receiving his complaint about the stolen bag, teams searched locations around Shah Rukh Khan’s bungalow on Carter Road. There was no sign of the bag. So the team checked CCTV camera footage and found Dhule walking on the road towards Taj Lands End. He sat the bus depot with the bag for a while, but when he left, he did not take the bag with him,” said the police.

Before reporting to MLC Jagtap’s residence, ASI Dhule had collected the firearms and arrived at the Bandra police station around 4.55pm on Friday.

When contacted, Bhai Jagtap told TOI to get in touch with the Bandra police to get a clear picture of the incident, as he was in Vadodara at that time.

Deputy commissioner Dahiya confirmed the incident, but refused to divulge details. He said that a diary entry of the same was made at the police station, and that a report would be sent to the concerned department at the commissionerate, who will decide on the further course of action.

A departmental inquiry into Dhule’s actions has been initiated, and will be completed before an action to suspend him can be taken.

City police spokesperson deputy commissioner Pranay Ashok said that he wosuld have to check the details about the incident and whether any action was taken against Dhule.

425,['5/01/2020'],Experts call for liberal policy to boost city’s fledgling IT sector,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Visakhapatnam: While speculation continues over Vizag becoming the executive capital of the state, experts feel a liberal information technology policy is the need of the hour to attract investments to the City of Destiny.

“Many states have IT policies which offer huge incentives to investors. We need a similar policy to ensure that the city’s IT sector, which is still in a fledgling stage, gets a timely boost and is ready to cope with the pressure of being the state’s executive capital,” says Naresh Kumar, vice-president of Rushikonda IT Park in the city.

A booming IT sector would encourage investors to come to Visakhapatnam, he said. “It would also improve international and domestic connectivity to the city. There would be more skilled labour and more training institutions will come up. Supporting facilities like hotels, residential complexes and intra-city communication too would develop to a great extent,” he added.

Though it’s been more than a decade since the setting up of the IT hub in Rushikonda, big companies are reluctant to set base there due to lack of supporting facilities. “The Rushikonda layout was developed 25 years ago while the dedicated IT hub was created about 12 years ago. There are a few restaurants and a medicine stall in this hub. If the city becomes the executive capital, these issues need to be sorted out first,” said K Murali, a senior IT professional from the city.

Another issue that needs to be taken into account is traffic congestion, which will increase manifold once the city becomes the capital. But experts feel those issues can be addressed at a later stage. “The government first needs to roll out a comprehensive IT policy that will help attract investments. Look at Delhi. It is the national capital. The country’s top offices are based there, including the Supreme Court. If just being the capital was the yardstick to attract investments, then all investments in the country would have gone there. But that’s not the case,” added Naresh Kumar, who is also the president of Vizag Development Corporation.

Meanwhile, though a final call on the capital issue is yet to be taken, speculations have already begun about the places where the temporary offices would be established. Ch Srinivas, vice-president of Credai’s Visakhapatnam chapter, is confident that it’s just a matter of time before Vizag is declared the executive capital. “We are sure it would be announced shortly. It will likely be built in Kapuluppada in the northern part of the city, where plenty of land is available. The area is close to the city and is also in close proximity to the proposed Bhogapuram airport,” he predicted.

There are also talks that the temporary secretariat will come up near Satyam junction. However, water shortage could pose a problem there.

“This is where the Polavaram project will play a key role. The city will require water not just for industrial purpose but to cater to the growing population once the capital call is taken,” said B V Radhakrishna, former minor irrigation advisor to the erstwhile government of united AP.

Visakhapatnam: In the wake of the executive capital proposal, the city’s civic body seems to have gone on an overdrive to take up proposals to widen roads and main junctions and translating them into action.

The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) has identified four intersections to be developed in the city and is also planning four flyovers. The aim of these projects is to ease traffic congestions on major junctions.

According to sources, projects worth Rs 800 crore are being planned. The GVMC, in association with the city police has identified four main junctions in the city which suffer from traffic jams regularly.

Talking about the projects in the pipeline, GVMC commissioner G Srijana said, “We have long-term plans for the city with an estimated budget of Rs 15,000 crore. Of which, Rs 500 crore worth of works has been initiated. Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) are ready for some of the projects.”

As per the proposals, four flyovers are being planned at four intersections across NH-16, which passes through Hanumanthawaka Junction, Carshed Junction, Maddilapalem Junction and Gajuwaka Junction. Moreover, there are plans to widen major arterial roads in Dwarakanagar and the Srikanya Theatre area.

Visakhapatnam: The promise of Vizag becoming the executive capital having gained momentum, the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP) is scouting locations for its administrative building. The state’s sports authority is reportedly looking for space in and around the GVMC’s Swarna Bharati Indoor Stadium near Maddilapalem.

The SAAP administration was shifted from Hyderabad to Vijayawada in October, 2016 following bifurcation. Since then, the SAAP administration was being carried out from the Indira Priyadarshini Municipal Stadium.

According to sources, the SAAP head office will be shifted to Vizag if the city indeed becomes the executive capital. “SAAP may take over the Swarna Bharati stadium,” said a senior SAAP employee. However, vice-chairman K Bhaskar maintained that no communication regarding executive capital has been received till date.

428,['5/01/2020'],SS update: City tops in citizens’ feedback,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) has come out first in the country in collecting citizens’ feedback for the on-going Swachh Survekshan 2020 as of Saturday.

Other cities from Andhra Pradesh which feature in the top 10 are Tenali, Tirupati and Palamaneru.

On the other hand, Vizag stands at the seventh place in overall rankings as per the Swachh Survekshan Josh Tracker as of Saturday.

Citizen feedback constitutes a key part of the survey as it has a 25% weightage (1500 marks) in the 6000-mark survey.

Citizens can still share their feedback through the Swachhata helpline number: 1969, the Swachhata App, the Swachh Survekshan 2020 portal, outbound calls and the Vote for Your City App from January 4.

Citizens can provide feedback on seven parameters such as conditions of public or community toilets, cleanliness of public or commercial areas, waste segregation and awareness of Swachh Survekshan.

Apart from public feedback on the seven questions, the number of active users on Swachhata App or Swachh Manch/local App (integrated with Swachhata App) will also be measured to award marks under the citizen feedback component.

The other aspects that will be considered include the percentage of complaints resolved within the service-level agreement time-frame and user feedback on resolved complaints.

Swachh Survekshan teams are likely to visit the city between January 4 and January 31 to take direct feedback from citizens as well as for direct observation of the city’s sanitation and cleanliness levels.

429,['5/01/2020'],Does city have enough water to host executive capital?,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Visakhapatnam: If Vizag were to really become the executive capital of Andhra Pradesh, one of the most significant problems will be that of water. Experts believe that Vizag does not have adequate water resources to cater to large-scale immigration.

Experts are of the opinion that even when the Polavaram project is completed and water released, there would still be a considerable deficit, considering the requirement in terms of industrial commitments made.

Former civil servant EAS Sarma said, “We simply do not have water to host the executive capital. We will not have enough even after the completion of Polavaram.”

“If the Polavaram project is completed by 2021, around 1,137 MLD of water will be available, while the requirement will be 1,751MLD. This means, there will be a deficit of 614MLD per day with Polavaram. Without Polavaram, there will be a deficit of 1,424MLD water per day,” Sarma, who is now the convenor of Forum for Greater Visakha said.

Meanwhile, BV Radhakrishna, an irrigation expert said that while the executive capital idea is welcome, the issues concerning water supply to Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram need to be addressed.

Radhakrishna said, “The previous government has committed 60TMC Godavari water to the Krishna delta by constructing the Pattiseema lift irrigation project. This has resulted in the Polavaram project getting truncated, which was supposed to supply water to dry areas in Vizianagaram for irrigation. But the canal stops in Vizag.” He added that the state government must ensure adequate supply of water by implementing the Sujala Sravanthi in Vizianagaram and dry parts of Visakhapatnam.

The irrigation expert added that it is unfortunate that the two main rivers which feed the Godavari— Sabari and Sileru originate in the Andhra-Odisha Border area in north-coastal AP but the region is denied of its water.

430,['5/01/2020'],"Sustained cold spell may hamper mango yield, farmers worried","This story is from January 5, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Farmers of north-coastal Andhra Pradesh are worried that the low temperatures across the region could affect the mango crop. With day and night temperatures hovering between 15°C and 21°C, farmers are keeping their fingers crossed.

The sharp dip in temperatures, say farmers, could hamper the flowering of mango in the plains of Visakhapatnam. Mango is the main horticulture crop and is grown across 20,000 hectares land in the district.

The yield was poor last year too, owing to drought-like conditions. This year, if the low temperatures sustain for much longer, it could hamper the flowering in mango trees which is supposed to happen around this time. R Srinivasa Rao, deputy director of horticulture, Vizianagaram said, “The problem is not so much with the cold weather, but with mango hoppers (a pest) which thrive in cold weather conditions and cause a drop in flowering.”

Assistant director of horticulture K Sailaja said, “The flowering happens during winter. But pests manage to damage flowers in case of a long and sustained cold spell.”

Farmers point out that mango plantations have come down in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram over the last few years owing to the dry spell between 2017 and 2019. Now the cold spell has become a major cause of concern, they say.

431,['5/01/2020'],Erra Matti Dibbalu in dire need of protection,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Year after year, the same saga of neglect of ‘nobody’s property’ continues. Declared as a scientifically significant geo-heritage site by the Geological Survey of India (GSI) in July 2014, Vizag’s Erra Matti Dibbalu (Red Sand hills) near Bheemili, is still lying amidst litter in sheer neglect.

Without even a signage, fencing or gate, the place is filled with garbage left behind by picnickers and revellers. Garbage is also strewn all along the Vizag-Bheemili road bordering the Red Sand hills. At times, hue and cry is raised by heritage activists to stall attempts of illegal construction at the rare geological formation site. However, there is still no proper committee or government body to safeguard the site that is in utter need of protection.

Heritage narrators and activist couple Jayshree Hatangadi and Sohan Hatangadi, who visited the site recently, plan to hold a clean-up drive with India Youth for Society (IYFS) volunteers this Sunday (January 5) from 6.30 am to 11 am.

“For the clean-up drive, volunteers from Indian Navy’s INS Kalinga and JCI organization will also collaborate. However, it’s not a permanent solution. The 2km by 4km site needs wire fencing, gate, signage and a protection committee to check littering and entry of drinking public. As of now, there is no clarity as to who is responsible for maintaining the site,” rued Sohan.

The rare marine geological formation near Bheemili, dating back to the Holocene period (approximately 12,000 years) is one of three such heritage geological sites existing in South-East Asia (besides the ones in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka). These geo-morphological formations, consisting of a mixture of sand (40-50%), silt and clay (another 50%) were formed when ancient sand moulds were blown from the beach to the land. They indicate sea level oscillations and the extent to which the sea level has receded from the land.

“For over a decade, local administration like GVMC and VMRDA and the state tourism department have not been able to get their act together to save and promote Erra Matti Dibbalu. Even though it was declared a significant geological site by the GSI, and seminars, meetings and rallies were held for its protection, it continues to be treated just as badly as ever with callous public littering and destroying the site,” said Jayshree.

Visakhapatnam: The area under GVMC (Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation) is going to be reorganised into 98 wards. The number of wards will increase to 98 from 81 earlier.

According to a government order issued on Friday, cities that have a population of over 15 lakh shall have 90 elected members in local bodies. For every 50,000 people over and above 15 lakh, the number of elected members will increase by one. “There shall be one additional elected member for a fraction of more than 25,000 people,” read the order.

After the five Bheemili villages with a population of 19,000 were merged into GVMC a few days ago, the city’s population increased to 19 lakh. Therefore, according to government guidelines, the city will have a total of 98 wards.

Nine new wards were carved out in Vizag in 2017, increasing the number of wards from 72 to 81. As per the 2011 census, the city has a population of 18.81 lakh.

The number of wards was fixed on the basis of prevailing norms of having 63 wards for the first 10 lakh population and 18 wards (one ward for about 50,000 people) for the remaining 8.81 lakh people, totalling 81 wards.

Later, the GVMC conducted a reorganisation process for the 81 wards and sent a report to the state government. Now, the GVMC has to initiate the delimitation process again. GVMC chief city planner AJ Vidyullatha said that the civic body will reorganise the wards on the basis of new guidelines from the state government. “We will also address issues related to geographical precincts of the wards in due process,” said Vidyullatha.

Sanjay Raut

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena politician and Saamna editor Sanjay Raut said on Saturday that the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) should be opposed because it is against Hindus too and 30% Hindus will suffer when it is clubbed with the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Speaking at a symposium held by Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) at Marathi Patrakar Sangh, Raut tried to allay fears among Muslims about the CAA, the NPR and the NRC. Using the popular Bollywood dialogue “Jo dar gaya so mar gaya”, Raut told the predominantly Muslim audience to get out of the fear syndrome. “We in Maharashtra just showed that we don’t fear anyone. We want you too to get out of fear,” he said.

Referring to Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray, Raut said he would often say that the country belonged to all. “We all are one and this country belongs to every Indian who is loyal to the country,” he said.

Without naming Union home minister Amit Shah , who declared on Friday that he would not budge an inch on CAA, Raut said: “Aap kahte ho ek inch bhi nahin hathenge. Hum dhakka dekar hata denge (You say you will not budge an inch. We will push you out).” He said many in the media wondered if he would really attend a function held by the Jamaat-e-Islami. He said he had no problem attending the event as “we all are brothers and the programme is being held at Marathi Patrakar Sangh”.

Opposing a call by Justice (retired) Kolse Patil to “25 crore Muslims” to come on the streets against the CAA, NPR and NRC, Raut said people must not get divided in numbers.

Senior counsel Mihir Desai and Yusuf Muchchala discussed how the CAA was against the spirit of the constitution as it “discriminated” among citizens in the name of religion and after it is followed by NPR and NRC, all Indians will suffer.

304 trees need to be cut for Blue Line extension in Gzb

GHAZIABAD: The Dwarka-Vaishali Blue Line is on its way to becoming the Dwarka-Mohan Nagar Blue Line, adding 5km and four new stations to Delhi Metro ’s second-longest corridor.DMRC on Saturday submitted the detailed project report for the long-awaited extension of the Ghaziabad section of the Blue Line, which will see it converge with the Red Line at Mohan Nagar. The report pegs the construction cost of the project at Rs 1,808 crore, of which 74% will be borne by the UP government and 18% by the central government. Unlike in the Dilshad Garden-New Bus Adda metro project, DMRC will not contribute anything in the form of rolling stock in this project.The land requirement for the three new stations on the route — Prahlad Garhi, Vasundhara Sector 14 and Sahibabad — and for the elevated alignment will be 86,857 sq m.The land requirement for the three new stations and for the elevated alignment will be 86,857 sq m, which will also include private land that Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) will have to acquire. “There are a total of 304 trees that are coming in the way of the corridor and are required to be cut,” said VN Singh, chief engineer of GDA.According to the DPR, Sahibabad station will in future also serve as a major future transit hub as an RRTS (rapid rail) station will come up under the proposed Electronic City-Sahibabad corridor. Mohan Nagar already has a Red Line station on the Dilshad Garden-New Bus Adda line, which was made operational in March 2019, officials said. The Pink Line, metro’s longest, stretches 58.59km, though it’s currently a fragmented corridor.DMRC has set April 2020 as the likely commencement date of the project and hopes to complete it in April 2024. Though an approval from the UP government is a formality, raising money for the corridor is a concern for GDA, which has sought financial assistance from the state government.“As per the DPR, the project will take four years to complete,” said GDA chief engineer Singh. The DMRC has shared the funding pattern in the DPR. “Of Rs 1808.22 cr project cost, the Centre’s contribution has been pegged at Rs 210.67 crore while the state government will have to bear the remaining cost,” said Singh",ghaziabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73104323,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-340754,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/blue-line-to-be-extended-in-ghaziabad-till-mohan-nagar/articleshow/73104310.cms

The exercise will be carried out by senior leaders headed by party president M K Stalin.

CHENNAI: The DMK is all set to review its performance in the just-concluded rural local body polls. More importantly, the party wants to do an introspection to figure out what led to the defeat of the alliance in many seats considered sure-shot bastions going by the performance in earlier polls.

The exercise will be carried out by senior leaders headed by party president M K Stalin. “It will start after the coming assembly session. We will summon the party secretaries in districts where the party has fared badly,” said a senior DMK leader.

The differences with its ally Congress and the decision of the latter to go it alone cost the DMK dearly in Kanyakumari district. The AIADMK did not win even a single seat in Kanyakumari district in the 2016 assembly elections and it had lost deposit in Vilavancode assembly segment. But the ruling party made a comeback by securing 4 out of 11 district panchayat councillor seats and 16 out of 111 panchayat union councillor seats. Its ally BJP won 2 district panchayat seats and 31 PU council seats. The Congress, which snapped the alliance in Kanyakumari East district, won 5 district panchayat council seats, but the DMK came a cropper. However, the DMK won 21 and Congress 24 panchayat union council seats.

Another shocker was Tuticorin. In the hotbed of Sterlite protests, where DMK’s Kanimozhi swept the Lok Sabha polls, the principal opposition party could win only 5 out of 17 district panchayat seats. The party got only 61 panchayat union seats vis-à-vis AIADMK’s 63. “We are concerned about loss of ground in the fishermen belt, especially in Tuticorin district. Problems in seat-sharing cost us dear in Kanyakumari district. We should have swept the polls if the DMK and Congress had stayed together in Kanyakumari. A meeting of senior leaders will analyse the results,” said the leader.

Similarly, in Dharmapuri and Theni districts too, the party has fared poorly compared to its performance in the recent LS polls.

The DMK has captured Pudukottai district, including Viralimalai, state health minister C Vijaya Baskar’s constituency. “People in Pudukottai were unhappy with the ruling party leaders. It was evident during the campaign itself,” said the DMK leader.

AYODHYA: Two worshipped stones ( pujit shilas ) locked in Faizabad district treasury during then PM Vajpayee’s stint at the Centre may finally be taken out of the closet after 18 years for the Ram temple, mandated by the Supreme Court verdict. The shilas were ritually worshipped by the two flagbearers of the temple movement, Ashok Singhal and Mahant Ramchandra Das Paramhans, both of whom have passed away.

The twin stone columns or ‘pujit shilas’ as termed by Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), were deposited in Faizabad district treasury by then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government after the administration imposed curbs on VHP’s ‘shiladaan’ (stone donation) ceremony organised in March 2002, following Supreme Court’s directive for status quo at the disputed site.

Then president of Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas Ramchandra Das Paramhans and then working president of VHP Ashok Singhal worshipped the stones and performed ‘shila daan’ for temple construction. While Paramhans died in August 2003 at the age of 90, Singhal passed away in November 2015 at 89.

Now that the Supreme Court has cleared decks for temple construction in Ayodhya , the two ‘shilas’, 5-foot long and 2-foot wide, are likely to be taken out of the closet after the temple trust is constituted. VHP is likely to take a decision on the fate of the ‘pujit shilas’ at its Kendriya Margdarshak Mandal meeting during the upcoming Magh Mela in Allahabad.

Talking to TOI, next friend of Ram Lalla Triloki Nath Pandey said, “As a tribute to these two great leaders, the stones must be released from government treasury and used in the construction of Ram Mandir.” Central secretary of VHP Purushottam Narain Singh said the upcoming trust would take a decision on ‘shilas’.

Former president of VHP Praveen Togadia said, “All ‘pujit shilas’ donated by people, including the ones kept in Faizabad treasury, should be used in temple construction.”

And with Makar Sankranti just ’round the corner, many a Hyderabadi peeps are already gearing up to throw their big, fat annual patang party.After all what’s Sankranti without a fun day of kite flying with friends and family, binging on some yummy goodies and dancing to some peppy beats? Haven’t gotten around planning yours yet? Worry not, we’ve got your back. Here’s all the ideas you need to throw a fun-filled patang party that your gang will remember for the whole year to come...The best part about a patang party is you can dress up or dress down, as long as comfort is the keyword. For an uber insta worthy party album, you could go for a common colour scheme as the dress code. Think whites paired with blue denims. Else, pick a broader theme — such as shuddh desi — and let your guests decide what they want to wear. Dress comfortably in a way that will not hinder your fun activities and dance/ kite flying movements.weet pongal, boorelu, paramannam, ariselu — Sankranti snacks are aplenty in every Telugu household. If yours still makes these from scratch, your guests are a lucky lot. If not, get some from the market. The roof top buffet spread should have lots of fuss-free finger foods and mason jars filled with refreshing drinks to keep guests fuelled up.There is no party without music and you’ve definitely gotta amp up the boom box to churn out some Bollywood numbers to get the party going. Some of our favourites would be, Udi Udi Jaaye (Raees), Manja (Kai-Po Che) Dheel De De (Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam), which are perfect patang numbers.Peppy Telugu beats, remixes of retro hits and even the odd club hits are must-haves on the playlist.As most patang parties are held on the terrace, the décor could be minimal yet traditional — think marigolds and mango leaf thorans with funky elements like a bedecked rickshaw, or a giant kite... A pretty shamiyana would be perfect for those who want to chill in the shade while the others are screaming ‘affffaaaa’. a picture booth, where guests can take goofy pictures with props, could be a fun addition!The Chinese manjas are razor sharp and a great eco hazard. The thread is made of nylon, plastic or other synthetic materials, laced with glass, metal and other sharp objects which could be extremely dangerous both for you and your guests. What’s more, they kill and maime hapless birds, which get entangled on the loose threads hanging on trees and poles. This kite season, don’t leave any stray manja hanging around!sustainable celebrations are the need of the hour. It’s best to opt for paper kites for your parties — they are classic and colourful. plastic patangs are a big ‘no’.While flying kites or dancing, be careful and mindful that you are on the rooftop. If alcohol is served, or if children are around, make sure someone’s keeping an eye on all the guests. Guard against injuries from sharp threads too. stay sun safe by donning hats, sunglasses and sunscreen. And, always keep afirst-aid box handy.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73099133,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-64038/73099133.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/events/hyderabad/goflyakite-a-dummys-guide-to-hosting-the-perfect-patang-party-this-makar-sankranti/articleshow/73099133.cms

A chunk of the main entrance that was being repaired caved in at Burdwan railway station on Saturday

By: Md Asif

BURDWAN: A portion of the main entrance of Burdwan railway station collapsed on Saturday evening, injuring two persons. One of them is critical. Though there were no reports of any deaths till 10pm, an operation was underway to remove the rubble and ensure that no one was trapped beneath it.

According to an eyewitness, a chunk of the building’s facade that was being repaired fell around 7.50pm, triggering panic among passengers, hawkers, vendors and visitors as it is usually a very bustling section of the station complex. As people started running helter-skelter, bigger chunks fell off.

A big crowd had gathered at the spot and was taking photographs of the building with their cellphones when the entire section came crashing down like a pack of cards. The large neon signboard reading ‘Eastern Railway’ on the building’s terrace was reduced to just ‘Eastern’ within seconds.

Luckily, the time lapse between when the first chunk fell and the final portion collapsed allowed people to disperse to safety. The section that came down housed an inquiry office and the facade over the retiring room.

Also, fortunately, no local or major express train was running shortly before or after the incident. A civil defence team arrived around 9.30pm and began clearing the debris to check if anyone was trapped. Police personnel rushed to the spot to assist in search operations, and also to contain the huge crowd.

Two persons have been admitted to Burdwan Medical College & Hospital. One of them was identified as Hopna Tudu, a resident of Jharkhand. Tudu, who received an injury on his right leg, had come to see off his daughter.

“Train movement was normal as none of the platforms was affected due to the incident. We immediately opened an alternative entrance to the station for the convenience of passengers,” said Nikhil Chakraborty, CPRO, Eastern Railway.

“We have ordered an inquiry into the incident. Whether or not there was any lacunae in the maintenance will be ascertained thereafter. Our priority is to rescue and treat the injured,” he said.

450,['5/01/2020'],Kolkata priests in cassocks to march against CAA,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Kolkata: Priests from the Kolkata Diocese of the Church of North India (CNI) will hit the streets in their white cassocks on January 20 to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens.

The Roman Catholic Church under the Archdiocese of Calcutta organised a similar walk on December 26 after the Christmas celebrations (though the clergy had not joined in then). Both the walks — the post-Christmas one and the one planned for January 20 — follow several heads of churches including “anti-discrimination and anti-CAA” messages in their Christmas sermons (reported by TOI on December 26).

Clergy from suburbs, including the Barrackpore Diocese, will join in the January 20 march, singing hymns in English and Bengali highlighting how Jesus “never supported divisive acts” and had urged Christians to stand united during crises. This protest walk will start from St Paul’s Cathedral and end at Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in the Maidan.

Kolkata Bishop Paritosh Canning expects the entire clergy to turn up at the march along with principals of schools that are under the administration of the diocese.

Principals have already received the proposal from the bishop and expressed their solidarity with the cause.

“It will be a very Christian thing to do... to walk peacefully, protesting against division. The country is being divided in the name of religion..., which negates the secular fabric of India,” Angela Ghosh, principal of the new campus of Scottish Church Collegiate School, said.

The bishop’s office said Canning decided to convene the march because he felt it was time for one minority community to stand by another when efforts were on to drive a wedge in society in the name of religion.

The CNI has also invited three other prominent Protestant churches not within its fold — the Methodist Church, the Baptist Church and the Assembly of God Church — to participate in the walk. Invitations have also been sent to the Roman Catholic Church.

Representatives of the clergy will submit memorandums to Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and governor Jagdeep Dhankhar after the end of the march; copies will be sent to PM Narendra Modi and president Ram Nath Kovind.

“This is the first time that the CNI, under the bishop’s leadership, has convened an anti-CAA protest. He will lead the walk and the entire body of the clergy will walk with him. It is going to be a massive affair,” CNI Kolkata Diocese secretary John Ghosh said.

Egra (West Midnapore): Trinamool Congress has asked its MLA from Egra to show cause why he shared a dais with Bengal BJP president and Midnapore MP Dilip Ghosh at the inauguration of Egra Mela on Friday.

TMC MLA Samaresh Das was present at the programme along with the Midnapore Municipality chairman.

The MLA not only attended the programme but spoke and referred to the atithi deva bhaba (guest is God) tradition while Ghosh sat on the dais.

“I won’t talk politics. I have never come across the courtesy shown to me today,” Ghosh said on Friday. District Trinamool leaders wondered how an MLA could share a dais with Ghosh when Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee has crossed swords with BJP over the CAA-NRC issue.

Das was taken aback at the turn of events. “I had gone to the inauguration of Egra Mela, a traditional fair being held for the last 34 years. It was not a political platform. Neither I nor the BJP leader spoke about politics. I am told the party has showcaused me. I will definitely send my reply,” the MLA said.

Ghosh said: “It shows how intolerant Trinamool can be. They don’t have the courtesy to greet others. Worse, they crack the whip on their MLA for showing courtesy.”

Malda: Around 1kg of snake venom was seized from a hotel at English Bazar on Friday evening and three persons were arrested. Unlike previous seizures, the venom had been processed, which has led officers to suspect the presence of a laboratory around these parts.

A team of six personnel from the Malda police crime monitoring cell visited a hotel posing as customers. There, the team seized a crystal jar containing about 1kg venom.

The three accused are from Kaliachak — Rafik Ali and Asique Mandal of Bamantola village and Masud Sk of Akandabaria village. The trio was produced in court and taken into police custody on Saturday.

A forest official said: “We suspect the seized jar contains cobra venom, which has a high demand in markets, especially in China. The venom is also used to make narcotics, which are used in rave parties.”

The Indo-Bangla border in Malda and South Dinajpur has been used to smuggle snake poison of late. Last March, around 1.5kg of poison was seized from Gazole on its way to being smuggled to Bangladesh. In May, there were two seizures of venom from Tapan in South Dinajpur and Malda’s Doulatpur. And in April, a substantial amount of snake venom was seized near Balurghat.

‘More private parties pushed up Scotch sales’

KOLKATA: With the year-end party spirit spilling over to the New Year, Kolkatans said cheers to 2020 by splurging on more expensive liquor. Rather than low-end whisky or rum, tipplers have chosen to raise a toast with Scotch, premium whisky and wine across the city’s watering holes that have remained chock-a-block since December 31.Beer has been the preferred tipple in the afternoons while whisky has left other forms of liquor behind by a long way post-sundown. Off-shops, too, recorded a 20-25% spike in the sale of imported Scotch.The chill in the air has also led to a sharp spurt in the sale of room temperature beer and rum with warm water during the last week of the year, according to Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India secretary Sudesh Poddar.“From New Year’s eve onwards, there has been a marked shift towards premium brands of India Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), overseas spirits bottled in India (OSBI), wine and vodka. Instead of ‘prestige’ segment whisky, most have been ordering ‘premium’ ones that cost 30-40% more. While 80% of liquor sales in the evenings is whisky, 60% customers preferred beer during the day,” said Poddar.Liquor sale has seen a marginal slump across restaurants and bars during the festive period. This, however, is usual since most prefer to spend more on food than liquor. House parties are preferred for drinking, said HRAEI president Pranav Singh.Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India president Pranav Singh said: “Though liquor sales did not rise sharply, sale of premium liquor did go up at the year-end with customers graduating to a higher category. This is particularly so among whisky drinkers who have moved from Indian made foreign liquor to overseas liquor bottled in India to bottled in origin.”But what came as a surprise was the sudden spurt in orders for premium segment whiskies like Blender’s Pride, Signature Premium, Sterling Reserve B10 and Antiquity Blue, which a saw a 25% jump in orders compared to the corresponding period of last year. Overseas spirit bottled in India (OSBI) like 100 Pipers, Teacher’s and Black Dog, too, saw a 15% spike. Liquor bottled in origin (BIO) and Scotch sales went up by 10%. Charles Mantosh, who owns multiple restaurants on Park Street, acknowledged the year-end festivities had seen a rise in sale of premium liquor.“Though the market is tepid, those who step out spend a bit more than they usually would. The festive spirit around this time of the year combined with the weather resulted in an uptake in consumption of premium liquor,” said Mantosh. He, though, is unhappy the revenue from food that has dipped 20% since last December 31 and January 1.The move to an upper bracket of liquor may have been prompted by a lean period that preceded the festive week, felt some. Political unrest and an economic slowdown led to a nosedive in footfall across Kolkata’s restaurants.Off-shops recorded 25% jump in scotch sales during the last 10-12 days of December compared to the corresponding period of 2018. Consumption of rum saw a 15-20% jump, while the premium and regular whisky segments witnessed a modest double-digit jump. Sources close to the excise department pointed out the jump in Scotch sales was largely due to more private parties. “This time, there were a lot of private parties, where high-end liquor was served. Excise department kept a vigil on the parties to ensure no illegal (duty free or bought from other states) liquor was served,” added sources. The overall jump in liquor sales was 15-20%.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73104554,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1005442,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-raises-a-toast-to-2020-with-pricey-whiskies-wines/articleshow/73104108.cms

THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND AT YOUR KITE PARTY

Say no to Chinese manja:

Avoid plastic Patangs:

Be careful:

Kites, food, music and masti — sums up the perfect patang party, doesn’t it? And with Makar Sankranti just ’round the corner, many a Hyderabadi peeps are already gearing up to throw their big, fat annual patang party.After all what’s Sankranti without a fun day of kite flying with friends and family, binging on some yummy goodies and dancing to some peppy beats? Haven’t gotten around planning yours yet? Worry not, we’ve got your back. Here’s all the ideas you need to throw a fun-filled patang party that your gang will remember for the whole year to come...The best part about a patang party is you can dress up or dress down, as long as comfort is the keyword. For an uber insta worthy party album, you could go for a common colour scheme as the dress code. Think whites paired with blue denims. Else, pick a broader theme — such as shuddh desi — and let your guests decide what they want to wear. Dress comfortably in a way that will not hinder your fun activities and dance/ kite flying movements.weet pongal, boorelu, paramannam, ariselu — Sankranti snacks are aplenty in every Telugu household. If yours still makes these from scratch, your guests are a lucky lot. If not, get some from the market. The roof top buffet spread should have lots of fuss-free finger foods and mason jars filled with refreshing drinks to keep guests fuelled up.There is no party without music and you’ve definitely gotta amp up the boom box to churn out some Bollywood numbers to get the party going. Some of our favourites would be, Udi Udi Jaaye (Raees), Manja (Kai-Po Che) Dheel De De (Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam), which are perfect patang numbers.Peppy Telugu beats, remixes of retro hits and even the odd club hits are must-haves on the playlist.As most patang parties are held on the terrace, the décor could be minimal yet traditional — think marigolds and mango leaf thorans with funky elements like a bedecked rickshaw, or a giant kite... A pretty shamiyana would be perfect for those who want to chill in the shade while the others are screaming ‘affffaaaa’. a picture booth, where guests can take goofy pictures with props, could be a fun addition!The Chinese manjas are razor sharp and a great eco hazard. The thread is made of nylon, plastic or other synthetic materials, laced with glass, metal and other sharp objects which could be extremely dangerous both for you and your guests. What’s more, they kill and maime hapless birds, which get entangled on the loose threads hanging on trees and poles. This kite season, don’t leave any stray manja hanging around!sustainable celebrations are the need of the hour. It’s best to opt for paper kites for your parties — they are classic and colourful. plastic patangs are a big ‘no’.While flying kites or dancing, be careful and mindful that you are on the rooftop. If alcohol is served, or if children are around, make sure someone’s keeping an eye on all the guests. Guard against injuries from sharp threads too. stay sun safe by donning hats, sunglasses and sunscreen. And, always keep afirst-aid box handy.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/goflyakite-a-dummys-guide-to-hosting-the-perfect-patang-party-this-makar-sankranti/articleshow/73099323.cms

458,['5/01/2020'],Refugee outreachby Bengal BJP,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Kolkata: Bengal BJP leaders sat with party organisers and members of the IT cell on Saturday to focus on the refugee belts of Basirhat, Barrackpore and Barasat in North 24 Parganas, five days ahead of chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s rally from Barasat to Madhyamgram on January 9.

The purpose was to send out a message to the Hindu refugees to avail the window under the new citizenship law so that they don’t have to face the predicament that 14 lakh Hindus are facing in Assam.

“A self-declaration is enough for a citizenship application under CAA. There is no need to provide a document in support of the declaration. One can apply online as well,” said BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu. He claimed that while making the ap-plication, legacy documents won’t have to be furnished .

Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Saturday reached out to the refugee settlements of Gopiballavpur in West Midnapore and reassured those who came to India in 1950 and later to apply under CAA. “The Hindu refugees who were forced to leave their homeland and come to India in 1950 and afterwards are our honoured citizens,” he said.

What if a person having ration card or Aadhaar number doesn’t apply for citizenship? Ghosh said they will mi-ss the opportunity and may be asked to provide valid documents for migration. BJP leaders said under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act and Section 3/12 of the Passport Act, the onus lies on the accused to prove his bona fides.

Bengal BJP, however, leaves out Muslim “infiltrators” in the state. “Muslim reside-nts of our country have nothi-ng to worry about. Our complaint is only against Muslims who sneaked into India and have been staying here surreptitiously,” Basu said.

BJP leaders cited a case State versus Fatma in Ghaziabad district in Uttar Pradesh where the lady and her husband had entered without valid documents from neighbouring Bangladesh. The accused made a false statement that she was a Haldia resident and her husband hailed from Kolkata. Both of them were convicted and sent to jail for three years.

The Bengal BJP has already activated its IT team to send bulk messages, giving the “right information” on CAA to the people. “The Act has nothing to do with those who are bona fide residents. It doesn’t affect the Indian-born Muslims,” Basu said.

459,['5/01/2020'],Divisive politics could harm the economy: Kaushik Basu,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Kolkata: Divisive politics is affecting India and may impact the economy in the long term, former World Bank ch-ief economist Kaushik Basu said on the sidelines of a Ficci event here on Saturday.

Basu said three importa-nt institutions created in India since Independence — democracy, secularism and credible statistics — needed to be preserved. “Once institutions erode, that is a long-term problem,” he said.

While criticizing “hyper-nationalism”, he clarified that in India it is not linked to economic policies like in the US, which is raising tariffs and lowering migration. Rather, he said, it “erodes trust” and a “sense of belonging”.

About the economy, he said short-term issues could be dealt with through policy interventions. For instance, the National Infrastructure Pipeline is a “good idea” but, if not implemented properly, it could spark inflation. This apart, he said, Budget 2020 should look at better fiscal and monetary policy integration in order to boost demand. An interest rate cut, he maintained, can boost demand in the short run.

Commenting on the slowdown, he said India was going through “a very difficult economic phase” and 4.5% growth is “atrocious”.

Basu also said unemployment and the rural sector slowdown could be hurting consumption across the country. He cited the fall in automobile production and lower growth in electricity consumption.

Though he gave the government credit for pushing through goods and services tax (GST) and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, he said the haste in implementing GST had seen small businesses take a hit.

Ficci chairman (eastern region) Rudra Chatterjee, who interacted with Basu, said the world economy was witnessing slow growth, but that could provide Indian businesses an opportunity to increase market share.

Naihati: Sheikh Nur Hossain, the fugitive owner of the illegal firecracker factory at Naihati’s Masjidpara in No-rth 24 Parganas, was arrested from an Amdanga hideout on Saturday. He was booked under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) for the deaths of five factory workers after three explosions ignited a fire in the cracker unit on Friday afternoon.

The blasts had sent two bodies flying and shattered the windowpanes of neighbouring houses and shops. At least a dozen were seriously injured in the resultant fire as the entire structure was blown to smithereens.

Sources said Hossain earlier ran a cracker unit at his residence in Debak. “Later, he set up the factory on agricultural land at Masjidpara. He employed around 35 people, including a child, a woman and teenagers. It had no licence and there was no fire safety arrangement in the unit in which chemicals and explosives were stockpiled,” a resident said.

Forensic experts and Ba-rrackpore police commissioner Manoj Kr Verma visited the spot and collected samples from the debris.

Investigation revealed that nearly four dozen illegal firecracker units existed in Masjidpara-Debak-Mamudpur. “More than 50 such factories are running illegally inside houses in Masjidpara and Debak. Despite several police raids, locals started making firecrackers again,” a senior police official said.

“We will close down all such cracker units in the area permanently. Those people should be professionally rehabilitated soon,” Verma told TOI.

Kolkata: The new citizensh-ip law is one issue that has brought all anti-BJP parties and organisations on the same page.

In a bid to keep up the anti-CAA tempo, Trinamool Congress supporters took out a rally from Subhas Sarobar at Beliaghata to Rajabazar on Saturday while Forward Bloc hit Central Avenue.

TMC, the Left and Congre-ss have been harping on BJP’s bid to “drive a wedge on religious lines” on the ground that the law is a direct affront to Articles 14-23 of the Constitution that guarantee equality irrespective of race, caste, creed, religion and sex. The Supreme Court will take up a host of PILs against CAA on January 22.

In the meantime, all three parties have been hitting the streets and have lapped up pu-blic support, particularly am-ong students, against the “divisive CAA”. The Left has given a general strike call against CAA-NPR-NRC and economic issues such as employment and PSU disinvestment on January 8.

“When citizens were celebrating the New Year, many came out in the cold to protest against CAA and NRC. This is unprecedented. Political parties, rights organisations, students and individuals have voiced their protest while home minister Amit Shah has announced that there will be no going back on CAA. This is authoritarianism,” said CPM politburo member Mohammad Selim.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, after leading four anti-CAA protests in the city and Siliguri, has announced she will walk from Barasat to Madhyamgram on January 9 and take out a protest rally in the Hills on January 22.

BALLARI: G Somashekara Reddy, Ballari City BJP MLA and younger brother of tainted mining baron G Janardhana Reddy, was booked on Saturday for making an inflammatory speech and allegedly promoting enmity between two groups.His comments at a protest organised by BJP and ABVP in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Friday in Ballari drew flak from political parties and people alike.Police booked him under Section 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) of the Indian Penal Code after P Vivek, president, Cantonment Block of the Congress, lodged a police complaint.Earlier on Saturday, thousands of Muslims led by Congress and JD(S) leaders assembled near Shaadimal and took out a rally on the main roads of Ballari, demanding action against Reddy. They also burnt his effigy over his remarks, particularly ‘We are 80 per cent, you are 17 per cent’.Ballari superintendent of police CK Baba asked protesters to maintain peace and assured them a case would be booked against Reddy.However, they continued raising slogans. They relented only after the SP showed them a copy of the FIR registered at Gandhinagar police station and promised to initiate action against the MLA.At a road work bhoomi puja on Saturday, Reddy told mediapersons: “I addressed those who are disturbing the law and order, peace and harmony of the land, not everyone. Those who respect the law of the land need not be afraid. I request all minorities to live in the country peacefully and happily with everyone.”Congress MLA from Chamarajpet B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan on Saturday slammed Reddy for his remark, saying, “No secular-minded person will think like that. He’s just trying to destroy peace in the country. India is a secular country where Hindu, Muslims, Christians and Sikhs live peacefully.”On Friday, Reddy had warned the Muslim community against participating in anti-CAA protests, saying the CAA will not be good for them and they will have to face serious repercussions. “Let me caution those who are protesting against the CAA. Imagine what will happen if we (Hindus) take charge,” Reddy had said.Police extended security to Reddy at his residence in Ashok Nagar in Ballari Rural limits.

Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi

HYDERABAD: Reacting strongly to comments made by BJP MP D Arvind and MLA Raja Singh, Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday said he wasn’t scared of such hollow threats by them and was “ready to die…I want to achieve martyrdom”. Speaking at an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) meeting in Sangareddy late on Saturday evening, Owaisi said: “Prime Minister Modi your people want to kill me…Some people from Sangh Parivar want to kill me…I dare them. Shoot me, I am not afraid, I roam around alone and will continue to do so.”

Earlier, Goshamahal legislator Raja Singh had issued death threats to anti-CAA protesters and hinted that this list included the Owaisi brothers as well. This was followed by another scathing attack from Nizamabad MP Dharmapuri Arvind who warned Owaisi of dire consequences if he continued to oppose the CAA.

Launching an attack on both these BJP lawmakers, the AIMIM chief said: “We are not the ones who jump into the sea and complain about its depth. We are not afraid of the wild creatures in it. Our ship will reach the shore with Allah's grace.”

Thousands gathered for the meeting where Owaisi urged people to collectively fight for the repeal of CAA. “Ahead of Republic Day, make a video of yourself reading from the Preamble of the Indian Constitution and post it on social media appealing to the Prime Minister to withdraw the 'evil' CAA,” Owaisi said.

KOLKATA: An investment banker, Anant Shroff, and his wife wanted to help a puppy that was hit by a car in Salt Lake. But instead, they not only lost the dog but also Rs 97,000 from their bank account when they were duped by a phishing site that opened when they were searching for an animal rescue team online. The incident happened on December 29.

Shroff (40), an investment banker from Delhi, had come to Kolkata to attend his sister-in-law’s wedding. Shroff said he had called an “animal helpline number” of a website, which had popped up first on the Google search, and accidentally ended up sharing his UPI PIN and the OTP over a text message when the caller on the other side of the helpline had asked him to transfer Rs 10 — a token amount before they send an animal rescue team.

Shroff lost Rs 97,000 in a span of five minutes and even saw the puppy suffer to death in front of his eyes at CL Block as none came to the spot.

Shroff and his wife have lodged complaints with Bidhannagar East PS and cyber crime department of Bidhannagar City Police and blocked their bank account. But the fraudsters could not be arrested till Saturday and the website — www.srikanta-sahoo.in — that claims to provide 24x7 support for animals is active till date. However, when TOI called the helpline number 8910760215, it was switched off. Caller identification app Truecaller flagged the number as a “fraud call”.

Shroff’s wife Tamanna Kanoria, who wrote about her ordeal on Bidhannagar Police’s Facebook page on Friday, said that on January 29 afternoon, she and her husband saw a sedan running over a puppy outside their house at CL Block.

“The puppy was in pain and we wanted to help it. But since we didn’t know any animal care facilities here, we searched Google and the website from where we were robbed, topped the search list. Hence, we had dialled the helpline number,” said Kanoria, who will be heading back to Delhi on Monday. Shroff is now in China for a business meet

Shroff, who has quit his job recently and ventured into entrepreneurship, dialled the number and sought their help. “The person, who received the phone, asked him to pay Rs 10 online as transaction fee, post which he promised to release the rescue team to attend to the dog,” said Kanoria. The caller forwarded the payment link that asked the duo to enter some banking details along with Shroff’s UPI ID.

“Since we were concerned about saving the puppy, we entered details along with the UPI ID. Shroff’s bank account was linked to a UPI payment gateway. We even shared the OTP as it never struck us that they could indulge in fraud,” said Kanoria. Within minutes, Rs 97,000 was deducted from Shroff’s account in three instalments — Rs 48,000, Rs 45,000 and Rs 4,000 respectively.

By the time they realised they were being duped, the caller had switched off the mobile.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has warned that he will bomb sites important to Iranian culture if Tehran retaliates against the assassination of a top Iranian general that he ordered earlier this week.In an astounding threat, which is seen as amounting to a war crime if it is carried out, the US President raised the stakes in his confrontation with Iran to unprecedented levels.“Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!” Trump said in a set of tweets posted on Saturday evening.The US President prefaced the threat by explaining that “Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American, & badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he (Gen.Suleimani) had killed over his lifetime, including recently...hundreds of Iranian protesters. He was already attacking our Embassy, and preparing for additional hits in other locations. Iran has been nothing but problems for many years.”The direct public threat to attack cultural targets, regardless of the provocation, is unheard of in modern diplomacy or warfare. While many analysts said it went beyond the legitimate targeting of military sites, the crude threat immediately invited comparisons to Taliban ’s wanton destruction of the Bamiyan Buddha, a UNESCO heritage site in Afghanistan .There was also skepticism if Trump could really carry out the threat. ""For what it's worth, I find it hard to believe the Pentagon would provide Trump targeting options that include Iranian cultural sites. Trump may not care about the laws of war, but DoD planners and lawyers do...and targeting cultural sites is war crime,"" tweeted Colin Kahl, a former Obama administration official.Iran’s foreign minister Javed Zarif schooled Trump on international law – and English language, tweeting, “Having committed grave breaches of international law in Friday's cowardly assassinations, @realdonaldtrump threatens to commit again new breaches of JUS COGENS; -Targeting cultural sites is a WAR CRIME.”“Those masquerading as diplomats and those who shamelessly sat to identify Iranian cultural & civilian targets should not even bother to open a law dictionary. Jus cogens refers to peremptory norms of international law, i.e. international red lines. That is, a big(ly) ""no no"",” he added.Other agitated Twitterati pointed out that the U.S didn’t even nuke Kyoto during WWII to spare Japan’s cultural sites and treasures. ""The fact that Trump can go on Twitter and threaten to target non-military sites that are very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture' is an outrageous terrorist threat,"" noted one observer.Trump administration officials have been trying to portray Qassim Suleimani, the general who Trump had assassinated with Hellfire missile delivered from Drones, as an anti-American warlord who directed the killing of US personnel. But there is growing skepticism about the Trump construct, particularly efforts to link him to 9/11, because Suleimani was a Shia who was a sworn enemy of the Sunni engendered al-Qaida and ISIS.In fact, ISIS was the common enemy of both US and Iran/Suleimani, and experts say few would be more happy with the Iranian general’s assassination than ISIS extremists.In Video: Will hit very fast and hard: President Trump warns Iran",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73104695,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-809326,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-threatens-iranian-culture-derived-from-one-of-the-worlds-great-civilisations/articleshow/73104433.cms

489,['5/01/2020'],Karnataka high court quashes CM's authority to appoint parliamentary secretaries,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: A chief minister can't appoint MLAs and MLCs, who could not be accommodated in the cabinet, as parliamentary secretaries with pay and allowances equivalent to those of a minister. The high court on Saturday struck down as 'unconstitutional' the Karnataka Parliamentary Secretaries (Salary, Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1963 and the amendment brought to it in 1999. The court also recalled that in Bimolangshu Roy's case, the Supreme Court had already taken a view that the state assembly lacked legislative competence to enact a law providing for appointment of parliamentary secretaries.

A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka said the office of the parliamentary secretary has the trappings of posts of ministers of state without independent charge or at least deputy minister.

""The said Act will work as a device available to the chief minister to appoint members of the legislative assembly and legislative council of his choice as parliamentary secretary, who can't be made as minister due to constraints of Article 164(1-A) of the Constitution. This will completely defeat and nullify the upper ceiling imposed by Article 164(1-A) of the Constitution on the number of ministers,"" the bench added.

City-based social activist MB Adinarayana and advocate KB Vijayakumar had challenged the appointment of parliamentary secretaries.

BENGALURU: A chief minister can't appoint MLAs and MLCs, who could not be accommodated in the cabinet, as parliamentary secretaries with pay and allowances equivalent to those of a minister. The high court on Saturday struck down as 'unconstitutional' the Karnataka Parliamentary Secretaries (Salary, Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1963 and the amendment brought to it in 1999. The court also recalled that in Bimolangshu Roy's case, the Supreme Court had already taken a view that the state assembly lacked legislative competence to enact a law providing for appointment of parliamentary secretaries.

A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka said the office of the parliamentary secretary has the trappings of posts of ministers of state without independent charge or at least deputy minister.

""The said Act will work as a device available to the chief minister to appoint members of the legislative assembly and legislative council of his choice as parliamentary secretary, who can't be made as minister due to constraints of Article 164(1-A) of the Constitution. This will completely defeat and nullify the upper ceiling imposed by Article 164(1-A) of the Constitution on the number of ministers,"" the bench added.

City-based social activist MB Adinarayana and advocate KB Vijayakumar had challenged the appointment of parliamentary secretaries. Adinarayana specifically challenged the decision by then CM HD Kumaraswamy to appoint eight MLAs/MLCs as parliamentary secretaries in January last year. He argued that the appointments virtually take the number of council of ministers beyond the stipulated 15% of the assembly strength.

493,['5/01/2020'],Boy found dead in Manesar was sodomised &amp; tortured: Autopsy,"This story is from January 5, 2020

Representative image

GURUGRAM: A 9-year-old boy whose body was found in a Manesar village on Friday night was sexually assaulted and tortured before his death, an autopsy has revealed. The boy had multiple injuries on the head, which are suspected to have been caused by a blunt object.

Police are investigating if black magic was performed before the boy was killed, saying they had found a dead pigeon near the body. Some of the boy’s hair had been cut too, which, cops said, have strengthened the suspicion of sorcery.

A few pieces of bricks lay near the body — found just 300 metres from the boy’s home — and the police suspect the victim had been hit on the head with them.

Six police teams have been formed to investigate the case. Several people have been rounded up for questioning and the cops have recorded the statements of villagers and neighbours. According to sources, the investigation is centred around three angles — sexual assault, whether the boy was murdered as part of sorcery and if the accused was known to the boy’s family.

DCP (Manesar) Rajesh Singh said they were examining multiple CCTV clips of the area recorded between 9.20-9.40pm on Thursday. The boy is seen following a man in his thirties in one of the footage.

“The boy follows a man. It seems the man is known to the victim,” said Singh. He added the cops had not been able to identify the man as his face is not clear in the footage.

The officer said though there was evidence that black magic had been performed either before or after the murder, things will become clear only after the accused has been arrested. “The accused could be familiar with the boy’s family. We are recording statements of people in the neighbourhood,” Singh added.

According to the officer, the boy’s family has told the cops he was playing outside his home till 9pm on Thursday, but they could not find him after that. While CCTV footage shows the boy accompanying the man around 9.30pm, the autopsy report suggests he could have been killed around midnight. “This means the boy was killed hours after he was abducted,” an officer said.

The body of the 9-year-old was found during a combing operation of the area after police mounted a search. His parents thought he might have gone to a relative’s place. Relatives had also said the boy would often go to their houses.

Dr Deepak Mathur from the forensic department of Civil Hospital, who conducted the autopsy on the boy, said the nature of injuries suggested that the 9-year-old struggled to rescue himself as he was being tortured before being killed.

“It seems the boy was hit multiple times with a blunt object and subjected to torture . He struggled for a while. The boy was also assaulted sexually,” he said.

The doctor said samples had been sent to a forensic lab for further tests.

A relative of the boy said the family is originally from Bihar but had settled in Manesar 15 years ago.

The father runs a textile shop and lives in a rented accommodation.

“They had four children — two sons and two daughters. The elder son died of some ailment a few years ago. The son whose body was found was the second one. Now, they are left with two younger daughters.” the relative said.

He added that a number of children play in the area till late in the night, but there never had been any concern about their safety.

GURUGRAM: With the Board of the School Education Haryana bringing forward the dates for Class X and XII board exams this year, students are a harried lot.

Every year, the exams would be conducted in April and the results of it would be out in the fourth week of May. This year, the exams will begin on March 4.

The district education officer, Indu Boken, said on Saturday that the board had decided to hold exams early to speed up the application process that follows. “Results are delayed when exams are late. That causes a problem for students applying to other institutions or for higher education,” she said.

The students, however, would rather have more time to prepare.

“We usually get at least two months to study. This year, it’s already January and there is hardly any time to prepare,” said Sunil Yadav, a Class X student at Sector 4 Government School.

But even that problem comes later. Over the past few months, classes in many schools have been irregular because of the election or pollution.

“We are yet to finish everything on the syllabus. The exam schedule is also not a well-planned one. We don’t have enough time for the science exam, for instance,” said Sangita Kumari, a Class X student at Government School, Jacobpura.

The exam schedule is a problem for Class XII students as well. “We will get just two days for physics and maths. It will be very difficult for us. The board could have given us at least four days,” said Kamlesh Singh, a Class XII student at Government Senior Secondary School Boys, Civil Hospital.

495,['5/01/2020'],"Haryana: Farmers, workers gear up for January 8 strike","This story is from January 5, 2020

GURUGRAM: Lakhs of farmers, industrial workers, daily wagers and other government employees across the state are gearing up to take part in a nationwide strike on January 8 against many of the Centre’s policies.

Led by groups like the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Centre for Indian Trade Union (CITU), the one-day strike will see many voices join in.

“There are four forces that make this strike strong — call by trade unions, support by farmers’ organisations, involvement of students’ groups and inclusion of the anti-CAA movement under the banner of We The People,” said political activist Yogendra Yadav. “This should not be seen as a litmust test, but a protest against the government’s policies. The good thing is that people are coming out. The whole idea is to bring a strong narrative around real issues,” he added.

The call for the strike was first given in September at a mass convention of workers. Soon AIKCC, an umbrella organisation for over 100 farmers’ groups, joined in. After the CAA was passed, more groups responded to the strike call. Though the protest will be spearheaded by the farmers’ union, several others like Manesar’s Honda employees’ union and groups of government employees from the roadways, health department and municipal corporations will lend unconditional support. Some of the issues they had been highlighting are privatisation, rising unemployment, agrarian crisis, closing of industries, etc.

“There are three main angles to the protest. First is the agrarian crisis, which has brought farmers, dairy and fishery workers, and share-croppers together. Second is the economic slowdown and dilution of labour rights, which has forced workers of banks and healthcare facilities to come out and protest. Third is the attack on the fundamentals of the Constitution and introduction of an Act. For long, the government has skirted discussions on basic problems,” said Rajiv Godara of AIKCC.

Besides farmers, workers, civil societies and student groups, over 20,000 members of the Haryana Roadways union have also decided to up the ante against the government over its kilometre scheme, under which private buses are allowed in the government fleet.

GURUGRAM: The deadline to file property tax has been extended by a month to January 31.

“Those who have not filed property tax can deposit it and avail a 10% tax rebate. Properties of defaulters will be sealed and, later, auctioned if they fail to deposit the property tax in time,” MCG chief Vinay Pratap Singh said.

Property tax can be filed online on the MCG website or at the MCG offices in Sector 34 and in front of the Civil Hospital, and the community centre in Sector 42.

The Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 mandates filing of property tax for vacant plots and all types of complexes. In case it is not filed, an interest of 18% is levied every year. The MCG has sent out 253 notices so far and recovered Rs 1.2 crore from defaulters.

“We are yet to recover Rs 90 crore,” an MCG official said, adding that most defaulters are builders. If dues are not paid even when properties are sealed, defaulters are given 15 days’ time. After that, their properties are auctioned.
