Several flights have either been delayed, cancelled or diverted. Among the travelers who got caught in the situation was Atharvaa , who was en route Azerbaijan to shoot for his film with director Kannan . The actor spent over 24 hours at the Dubai airport, waiting for the runway to clear up.A source in the know says, “Atharvaa had left Chennai on Saturday and he had a connecting flight to Azerbaijan at Dubai. However, the runway at the Dubai airport was completely submerged in water because of the deluge. The actor had no other option but to wait for over 24 hours before he could catch his next flight.”Kannan, who reached Baku (capital of Azerbaijan) five days ago, confirms, “Atharvaa was supposed to join us on Sunday, but because of the flood situation in Dubai, he was stuck at the airport, with no other means of travel. He took a flight on Monday and reached Baku by noon. He’s joined Amitash Pradhan , Anupama Parameswaran and Aadukalam Naren and we started shooting the same day.

Talking to BT about it, he says, “I decided to opt out and it was an amicable decision. I felt that I was not able to justify my role as Dr Shashank Gupta in the current season, as compared to the previous ones. I did not want to let down my viewers, so it was best to move on.” Mohnish was a part of the first season of 'Sanjivani' (2002-2005), and he also featured in the spin off, ' Dill Mill Gayye ' (2007-2010).He says, “When this show started in August 2019, my track was going well, but things changed later. I discussed it with the makers and we tried exploring new angles, but they didn’t materialise. An actor can creatively enhance his character if there is clarity in the track or he is given the script much in advance, which unfortunately was not the case.”Meanwhile, the show has moved to a different time slot.

On a crisp weekend morning at Lalbagh recently, eager parents and children had gathered together for an ‘ant walk’. Guided by Sunil Kumar M – a senior science adviser at a foreign embassy, who has spent nearly 25 years observing ants – the event saw participants, armed with magnifying glasses, taking a stroll in the park to get a closer view of the lifestyle of this ‘eusocial’ insect.As the participants start observing the acrobat ants, Sunil explains that in an ant colony, specific roles are allocated to each ant. The queen ant is at the apex of the social hierarchyThroughout her life, the queen primarily has only one purpose – to lay eggs and expand the colony. In most cases, the queen ant picks her successor. The untimely death of a queen may also signify the death of the colony. To ensure her protection, she is always hidden deep inside the ant colony.These ants usually act as workers, foragers, nurses and care-givers for offspring. Their duties include finding food and cleaning the nest.The fertile male ants are thrown out of the colony, after which they need to find a virgin queen ant to mate with. Similarly, the fertile female ants are also thrown out. They can start their own colony once they find a suitable mate. Sometimes, these ants also challenge the authority of an existing female ant, in order to become the next queen.Ever noticed an ant with wings? These are often the fertile male or female ants that are given wings, so that they can find a new mate and start a new colony.If a worker ant tries to go rogue, fellow worker ants are known to bite that ant and bring it back into line. This happens because ants believe in working towards the greater good for the colony.Ants’ most common enemies are termites – they often fight for survival in similar habitats. Ants are also known to wage war on other ant colonies, in order to capture more worker ants for their own colony. The conquerors, thus, add more workers to their own colonies, branding them with their trademark smell.Some ants take up farming and grow fungus. They also milk a few insects and drink their nectar. Some others again use feathers for their nests in a way that they catch the morning dew and store it for later use.After spotting a solitary ant, a participant of the walking group asked, “Don’t ants walk in lines?” Responding to that, Sunil said that the trail network is not a general characteristic. According to him, some ant colonies are large in number, so foragers set out together and bring food home. They leave the trails on their path with pheromones, as if to announce: “Look, I found food here.” However, some colonies have fewer ants and, in such a situation, solitary ants set out to find food.He also shared a research that he and his team had undertaken, in which they marked large forager ants that stepped out to get food in specific colours and studied their routines. “Ants are very disciplined, and they stick to the paths assigned to them. Among the ones we had marked, we saw that each ant stuck to a particular route. One day, however, we removed one of these colour-marked ants. And we were stunned to find that the very next day, a non-marked ant stepped out looking for food in the same path of the ant that we had removed, indicating there was some knowledge transfer taking place in the nest,” he explains.On their way, the participants spot a red weaver ant on a tree. “Careful. They sting when alarmed,” warned Sunil, adding, “Often when ants bite or sting, they risk injuring themselves.

6,['14/01/2020'],Dhoondte reh jaoge! TV actors struggle to find a home in Mumbai,"Mumbai is known to attract tons of young aspirants from across the country, especially those who want to try their luck in showbiz. For most of them, getting a house on rent, is not easy. The bachelor tag comes at a price, so does being from the film and TV industry. In addition, societies are not open to actors who are in a live-in relationship. BT spoke to artistes from the TV frat who have had to struggle to find a good house, in a locality of their choice.Currently seen in 'Kundali Bhagya', actor Abhishek Kapur came to Mumbai from Delhi, five years ago. Initially, he stayed with his cousins, but later decided to rent a place. Sharing his experience, the Versova resident says, “I have been looking for a new, plush apartment in Mumbai for a couple of months now. But as an actor, it’s getting tough to get a good flat in a decent society. I have come to realise in the past couple of months that even if the landlord is fine with renting out his/her flat to actors, the society isn’t. Deals break down sooner or later. They point out to our lifestyle that they believe is undisciplined, but don’t non-actors also party and work late hours? Even the price they quote to an actor is quite different from what they charge a regular office-goer.”Currently residing in Versova, Anjum, who hails from Ratnagiri, has been living in Mumbai since her childhood. However, her parents did not support the idea of her becoming a model/actor and she decided to leave her home. Since then, for the last 10 years, the actress admits that she has been living out of suitcases. She says, “My profession was the biggest issue for most landlords. Being single and having no support from parents was another challenge I faced in finding a house. I had left my house way back in 2010-11. People felt that it would not be right to rent out a place to an actor, who is also single. I expect people to be liberal in their thoughts, but we fail to accept change or growth.”Sanjay Gagnani, who has been part of shows like 'Hamari Devrani', 'Encounter', 'Veera' and 'Pyaar Ka The End', feels that Indian society is never open to bachelors, live-in relationships and pets. Sanjay relocated to Mumbai in 2010 and stayed in Bandra for two years. He then moved to Andheri (in 2011-15 ) and Goregaon (in 2016-2019). Currently, he’s back to living in an apartment in Lokhandwala (Andheri). He says, “Most housing societies refrain from allowing bachelorsin their premises. It took me a while to find a society that allowed a bachelor. When I got engaged to Poonam and started living-in, I had to hide her when the landlady visited the house as she was against unmarried couple living-in. Finally, we had to move out. While moving in to another accommodation, the broker wanted us to lie about our marital status. We somehow managed to live there peacefully for three years because they thought we were married. Problems cropped up when we got two pets. The housing society opposed us and we had to leave. It took us a good four months and almost 80 houses to find a housing society that matched our criteria, and allows pets and a couple in a live-in relationship.'Gathbandhan' actress Priyanka Choudhary relocated from Jaipur to Mumbai in 2014, and has been living in Lokhandwala (Andheri). The actress feels there are no regulations or rules when it comes to renting out flats in Mumbai. She says, “If you are single, it apparently means you are loud and will get friends over to chill. If that is not enough, the distrust towards our profession is apparent; they do not trust us to maintain decorum. Shouldn’t the concern be about us not paying rent on time? What if a corporate professional creates issues? Standardising the process of renting out flats is the best way possible. One common rule for everyone should bemaintained, regardless of their marital status orprofession.”Puneet Sachdev relocated to Mumbai from Gwalior in 2005. In the initial days, he faced a problem finding a house because he was a bachelor-actor. Later, when he wanted to live-in with his actress girlfriend Pariva Pranati, who is his wife now, people refused to rent him an apartment. He says, “When you say you are an actor and single, society members look at you with suspicious eyes. Things have improved in the last four-five years, though. When Pariva and I used to meet members of various housing societies, they would be shocked that we were living-in and were looking for a house. Their first reaction would be ‘no’. I found it silly. After all, what is the guarantee that a married couple or a family renting a house will not create nuisance for you?'Vineet Raina came from Jammu in 2005 and it’s not been easy for him since then. He shares, “It seems to be a big crime to be an actor, who is single. Over the past few years, I have had a tough time searching a flat, from the suburbs of Andheri to Kandivali. Finally, I had to call my mom to Mumbai in 2010 to rent a flat in a decent locality. My mom came down from Jammu and stayed with me for a few months. My dad had just been through a surgery at that time and would have done better with my mom being around, but unfortunately, she had to stay with me in Mumbai to help me find an accommodation without any hitch.”Rehaan Roy, who is currently seen in 'Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega', relocated from Kolkata to Mumbai in 2016 and started living in Borivali with a friend. In 2017, he rented a place in Andheri, but faced unnecessary issues because people keep looking at him with suspicion. He says, “The landlord felt that my being an actor would create nuisance because it would mean girls visiting late nights. For six months, I did not get a house and continued staying at my cousin’s place. Whenever I tried to rent a flat, they’d give examples of crimes like the Maria Susairaj case (the starlet was accused of murdering TV executive Neeraj Grover in 2008) and Pratyusha Banerjee’s suicide in 2016. They have said no to hosting friends overnight, and having a girlfriend is also considered a crime.”Landlords say housing societies do not want flats to be given to actors as there have been a few bad examples in the past. Grisly murders involving struggling actors and suicide cases have also made owners wary of people from showbiz.Lashkarm Parakh, head of a housing society in Goregaon, says, “Actors may complain that housing associations and societies have set such rules, but people have witnessed nuisance in the past. A few months ago, I had rented my apartment to a single actor/manager and she used to host parties at odd hours with loud music. She also had actors coming over and bribing the security guards for better car parking space. They would quarrel with other flat owners when asked to follow the rules.”Another flat owner, Raman Gupta, said, “I had rented my flat to a celeb couple, who claimed to be married. After a few weeks, I came to know that the couple was not married and had no intention of getting married, either. So, one has to be careful.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73229034,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-66426/73229034.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/dhoondte-reh-jaoge-tv-actors-struggle-to-find-a-home-in-mumbai/articleshow/73229042.cms
7,['14/01/2020'],Gentleman: A sleeping beauty and a terrible scam in Jadesh Kumar's next,"As he counts down to the release of his second directorial, Gentleman Jadesh Kumar has mixed emotions. After the lukewarm response to his debut, Rajahamsa , which pushed him to write a “better film”, he is very happy with what he has been able to bring to the table, but is also nervous and excited to see how audiences react to the Prajwal Devaraj starrer. “I hail from a very small village near Hampi, and back when I was in high school and, subsequently, college, I was in a hostel,” says Jadesh.Jadesh adds, “Most of the students were hardcore fans of different actors and films in other languages as well, and it is there that my craze for Kannada movies began. Not only would we watch all films that released, but we also had typical fan brawls. The issue, though, was that this was also a time when a lot of the Kannada films that released were remakes, which gave me no leg to stand on during these fights with friends. More than the films, I was crazy about Kannada language, and I often wondered what I could do about this.” He then came to Bengaluru as soon as he finished his graduation, on the pretext of finding a job. What he did, then, was to enroll himself for a filmmaking course at the Directors’ Association, while also working as an office boy there. “I didn’t need that job, but I realised that it gave me access to a whole bunch of filmmakers and not only those who taught us as part of the course. During the months that I was doing the course, and working there, I got to have many meaningful conversations with directors, which were very insightful. When I finished my course, I wrote the script for a film called Dildar. Director Guru Deshpande saw the film and recommended it to many others and got me to join his team,” says Jadesh, who went on to assist the former on films like Raja Huli and Rudratandava, among others.His directorial debut, Rajahamsa, didn’t work at the box office. “It got me thinking what went wrong, and I realised that it did not give audiences anything novel. It paved the way for me to work harder and write a story that had something extra. As someone who follows news keenly, I came across something about the sleeping beauty syndrome , wherein the person suffering from it sleeps for hours together. When normal people work for 18 hours a day and sleep for six, I wondered how it would be for someone with the syndrome and switched those figures,” explains Jadesh.But he knew that a story around a medical condition would not be enough to draw audiences, so, Jadesh found a way to link it to the issue of illegal harvesting of egg cells from young women. “How the hero, Prajwal, takes on this mafia, while also dealing with his medical condition forms the crux of the story. But even though the film is a thriller, the entire narrative is not grim and much of Prajwal’s attempt at dealing with his condition involves situational comedy,” says the director. His biggest challenge, adds Jadesh, was to present all this within a manageable budget, which meant shooting at actual locations and not sets. “Several sequences in the film have been shot at garbage dumps and drainage tunnels, among others. In fact, when we shot at a garbage dump in Mysuru, to get to the location, we brought in an earth mover and created a stretch of road. When we moved the waste that has been decaying there for long, the stench was unbearable, but Prajwal never complained. We had many extensive schedules during the making of this film, to maximise output in the limited time we had permission to shoot, and Prajwal stood by me through it all,” Jadesh signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73228475,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-197976/73228475.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/a-sleeping-beauty-and-a-terrible-scam-in-jadesh-kumars-next/articleshow/73228475.cms
8,['14/01/2020'],"By 2030, 57% of global power demand should be met by renewables: IRENA","This story is from January 14, 2020

ABU DHABI: Renewable energy should supply 57% of global power demand by the end of the decade, up from 26% now, according to the intergovernmental International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

A booklet, ‘10 years:Progress toAction’, published on the sidelines of 10th annual Assembly of IRENA in Abu Dhabi , has charted the recent global advances and outlined the measures required to scale up renewables. Annual investment needs to double from around $329 billion in 2018 to$737 billion to deploy renewable energy at the speed required. Much of it could be met by redirecting planned fossil fuel investments. IRENA director-general Francesco La Camera said, “We must urgently address the need for stronger enabling policies and a significant increase in investment over the next ten years. Renewables hold the key to sustainable development and should be central to energy and economic planning all over the world.”

Additional investments bring significant savings by minimising losses caused by climate change because of inaction. Savings could amount to between $1.6 trillion and $307 trillion annually by 2030, IRENA said.

Strengthening the case for renewable energy,IRENA pointedtofalling technologycosts. Solar PV costs fell by 87% over the last ten years, and onshore wind turbine prices by 46%.

IRENA data shows that 60% of new electricity access can be met by renewables in the next decade through stand-alone and mini-grid systems. The global energy transformation by 2030 could also lead to generation of 30 million jobs.

Meanwhile, the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development on Sunday approved a $105-million loan for renewableenergy projectsin eight developing countries—Antigua, Burkina Faso , Chad, Cuba,theMaldives, Nepal, Saint Lucia , and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

10,['14/01/2020'],Goa's Liston joins Hyderabad FC,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Panaji: FC Goa’s promising forward Liston Colaco has joined Hyderabad FC to revive his career and get more playing time in the Indian Super League ( ISL ).

The 21-year-old has signed a two-and-half year contract with Hyderabad who are currently at the bottom of the standings. Liston managed only nine minutes across three games for FC Goa this season. Last year too his appearances were restricted.

After their dismal performance in the current season, Hyderabad have won only one match from 12 matches. They recently parted ways with former head coach Phil Brown.

Liston’s move comes a day after Hyderabad announced the appointment of former Bengaluru FC head coach Albert Roca.

With star striker Ferran Corominas and Hugo Boumous in fine form, Liston could never establish himself at FC Goa since joining from Salgaocar FC.

Sergio Lobera’s FC Goa are leading the standings with 24 points and only two points separate them from second-placed Bengaluru FC.

The Davolrim lad came to limelight in the 2016-17 Goa Professional League season where he emerged as the top scorer with 13 goals for Salgaocar. He then guided Goa to the final of the Santosh Trophy National Football Championship. Liston continued his fine form in the tournament and his brace in Goa’s 2-1 win over Kerala set up a final clash against old rivals Bengal.

12,['14/01/2020'],"CAA agitators ‘shot like dogs’, says Dilip Ghosh, sparks row","This story is from January 14, 2020

KOLKATA: West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh’s comment on Sunday that “anti-CAA protesters were shot like dogs in BJP-ruled states” has kicked up a major controversy and put his party at unease.

Ghosh slammed CM Mamata Banerjee “for not opening fire and ordering lathi-charge” on those destroying public property during anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests across the state. “Didi’s police didn’t take action against those who destroyed public property as they are her voters. Our governments in UP, Assam and Karnataka shot these people like dogs.”

The comment drew criticism from his party colleagues and political rivals. Union minister Babul Supriyo was the first BJP neta to distance the party from Ghosh’s statement. “BJP as a party has nothing to do with what Ghosh may have said. It is a figment of his imagination, and BJP governments in UP, Assam have never ever resorted to shooting people for whatever reason whatsoever. Very irresponsible of Dilipda to have said what he said,” he said.

Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta shared Supriyo’s “irresponsible of Dilipda” tweet but refrained from commenting. However, an unfazed Ghosh claimed his comment was in tune with his party line. At a Midnapore court, he said: “Whatever I have said is what the party’s stand is. If we get a chance in Bengal, we will handle it in a similar way.”

Reacting to Ghosh’s remark, Mamata said: “One political leader is saying that police should open fire (on vandals)… This cannot happen in Bengal. We will not let this happen in Bengal. Those who are provoking (people) should bear the responsibility for these actions. Bengal has not yet become UP or Gujarat . Protesters have been shot in UP and Karnataka.”

15,['14/01/2020'],"Unable to cope with job stress? Seek help, talk it out","Excessive pressure, no work-life balance, stressful work environments can make employees exhausted and anxious. Seeking help is the first step to recoveryFor many working professionals, a new year means a couple of months to go for the dreaded appraisal. While the pressure to achieve targets in office usually peaks as the year starts, experts say that one should not let it bog them down as it doesn't only affect their mental well-being, but may also lead to a loss of productivity. Several studies have explored the connection between a person's workplace and mental health, and a high number conclude that a toxic workplace has a negative health impact on people.""I was constantly under pressure to achieve my sales targets due to which my stress levels shot up and I could not sleep for more than four-five hours at night. I assumed this is normal in this industry, so never paid any heed to it,"" says Yatin, a 30-year-old executive at a sales firm, who only realised that he has an anxiety disorder when he was hospitalised due to a panic attack last year. And Yatin is hardly a one-off case as many people suffer from similar issues.According to WHO, a healthy workplace can be described as one where workers and managers actively contribute to the working environment by promoting and protecting the health, safety and well-being of all employees.In June 2017, an employee at Olark, a software company, shared her email exchange with her boss on Twitter. The employee had emailed her team about her absence from work, citing mental health as her reason to take a two-day leave. To this, the company’s CEO responded, ""I just wanted to personally thank you for sending emails like this. Every time you do, I use it as a reminder of the importance of using sick days for mental health. I can't believe this is not standard practice at all organisations. You are an example to us all, and help cut through the stigma so we can bring our whole selves to work.""In November 2018, after celebrities like Anthony Bourdain and Kate Spade committed suicide, Chuck Robbins, the CEO of Cisco, an American multi-national company, made headlines when he sent a company-wide email to Cisco's almost 75,000 employees. The subject line read: ""Making Mental Health a Priority"". In the email, Robbins encouraged employees to ""talk openly and extend compassion"" and told them that professional help was available for them. More than 100 employees responded to him, with many detailing their own struggles.Psychotherapist Urvashi Bisht, currently practicing at Maulana Azad Medical College,who has conducted sessions on mental health at corporate offices, states some early signs of mental distress.1. One of the warning signs can be when a person is confused about their emotions and is unable to understand what they are feeling – it's emotional confusion2. When a person feels stressed due to work, they cannot work efficiently and are unable to balance personal, social and work life3. Lack of sleep and appetiteDr Sandeep Govil, psychologist at Yashoda Hospital, Kaushambi, says, ""Lately, the stigma around mental health issues has decreased and as a result people are more open to seeking help. At least four out of my 10 patients suffer from psycho-disorders related to office politics or high targets.""Dr Govil says that rather than bottling up feelings, confiding in colleagues or family members should be the first step towards reducing stress. He says, ""My advice to anyone having a hard time at work is to seek a friend, colleague or a family member to confide in. One should also take small breaks at work to avoid getting bogged down by stress.""Psychotherapist Urvashi Bisht adds, ""Recently, I have seen an increase in cases where a person feels that they are over-qualified for their job, or there is a confusion regarding their role at the workplace. This leads to them assessing their self-worth on the basis of the work they do, which often leads to depression. I advise them to separate their self-worth from their job profile and promote self-love.""A Noida-based electronics firm has nap rooms in their office to help employees take short breaks for napping during work hours. ""Due to the nature of our work, we often spend over 15 hours working in office for a project. As employers we recognise that this can put strain on not just the physical, but also the mental health of our employees as well,"" says Mohit Mongia from NXP Semiconductors in Sector 16A, Noida.Sushant Patnaik, Head HR, Aeris Communications in Sector 62, Noida, says that their organisation keeps in mind the needs of their employees and constantly strives to make a better environment for them at work. ""The leadership and managers at our organisation are oriented to be aware and respectful of employees' needs for personal breaks and their right to a stress-free work environment.

Khesari Lal Yadav (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav has shot several movies in Lucknow. “15 to be exact!” shares Khesari as we met up with him while he was shooting for his 16th film at Kudiya Ghat in old Lucknow. “Out of the total of 20 movies shot in the state, 15 have been in Lucknow. Locations are not only good but are also easily available in Lucknow and this ease of shooting compels us to come here and shoot one movie after another. But a change that I have noticed in Lucknow is that shooting here has become a costlier affair, especially because of the hotels. Their tariffs have gone high and most of them are also booked for a good number of days since so many films are being shot here.Locations too have become quite expensive now. Rates bahut badh gaye hain,” he says.But the main attraction for the filmmakers, as per Khesari is, the ‘subsidy’. “The government subsidy is the major attraction for filmmakers as it is definitely a big help to us. Most of my films shot in UP have got subsidy and only a handful are in process. I don’t know about the amount as it is a producers prerogative but if the paper work is fine and up to date, subsidy is not an issue,” he says.Khesari Lal Yadav (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)Ask him about his short and sweet stay in the Bigg Boss house and he shares, “My stay was good but it is just that I couldn’t fight. Hamare UP ya fir Bihar se koi bhi jayega toh usko problem hogi adjust karne mein as we do not fight over petty issues. Plus, I, at any cost, was not ready to use cuss words for publicity inside the Bigg Boss house. The Bigg Boss fame, if you see in the past at the list of previous contestants and the winners, is very short lived. For that short lived fame I was not ready to stoop to such a level of abusing others. In real life also, I haven’t fought with people; so I realised soon that Bigg Boss was not meant for me. I was a misfit for a show like Bigg Boss. It is not that I don’t know cuss words, but I am an icon for many, and I wanted to remain that even after appearing on that show. It took me a lot of time to become Khesari Lal Yadav and I respect that and that was what was playing on in my mind while I used to see celebrities abusing each other.”Another reason why Khesari think he couldn’t get votes of people during his stay in the Bigg Boss house was because his singing was not aired. “I used to sing a lot inside the Bigg Boss house but then it was announced by Bigg Boss that I couldn’t sing the songs of my choice as then they will have to procure rights of those songs to be aired.

The filmmaker had quit direction two decades ago, but returned to the studio floor on Sanjay’s insistence. The actor and the filmmaker share an equation that dates back to the time when they first worked together on 'Naam' (1986). Sanjay says, “We’re nearly done with Sadak 2’s shoot. Bhatt saab is such an enthusiastic director and that hasn’t changed. He’s so focussed on his job as a director even though he’s doing it after 20 years. He’s done everything to keep up with today’s times. The kind of hours he has spent on the sets and the effort he has made to lead a young crew on this film is amazing and inspiring. Today, when I look back, it feels justified that we all decided that 'Sadak' (1991), as a story, should move ahead. It should not stop where it did decades ago. I remember I first spoke to Pooja (Bhatt) about this and then, we met and took this forward. When Bhatt saab came on board to write the story, I told him, ‘Either you direct it or I’m not doing the film.’ He gave in, and I’m glad that he did.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73229106,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-73037/73229106.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/mahesh-bhatt-saab-has-done-everything-to-keep-up-with-todays-times-sanjay-dutt/articleshow/73229127.cms

It was a fun-filled weekend with barks, mews and furry cuddles as Mumbaikars dropped in to the Pet Fed festival at Juhu. It saw an interaction with dogs and cats of different sizes and breeds, including strays. Says co-founder Akshay Gupta, “Mumbai certainly has its share of pet lovers — over 20,000 people came by, more than in any other city. At a time when you hear of so many cases of animal cruelty , this makes for such a positive experience. People understand and start to be more friendly towards animals. It was also more than a social gathering, there were so many informative sessions.”The two-day event saw a flurry of activities. A pet fashion show got cats and dogs to strut their furry style, dressed up in cute outfits. Shivani Patil, who judged the event, says, “It was difficult to choose the winners as they all looked cute. Some dogs wore superhero costumes and others even had environmentally-conscious costumes saying, ‘Save Water’.” Cat lovers headed to an international cat show. Says entrepreneur Renu Dahiya, who has five cats and bagged the trophy for them, “I brought my ‘babies’ to a pet festival for the first time and they loved it! I also got a few important tips on pet hygiene here,” she says.The animals had to fight the temptation to tuck into goodies, courtesy a ‘Building Biscuits’ game. In it, the pet parent had to build a tower of biscuits and if the dog got tempted to eat any of them before it was built, he got disqualified. On Sunday, the animals had a chance to show off their skills via a ‘Pets Got Talent’ show. It got them to do everything from spins and push-ups and yes, the most obedient doggie who followed commands well, was the winner.After all the music, food and games, a bunch of themed treats rounded up the fun. Cute ‘muttcakes’, food pops and vegan delights made for the indulgence here.

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi on Monday deferred the deadline by two years to April 1, 2022 for top 500 firms to separate the roles of chairman and MD/CEO. There was intense pressure from top corporates and PSUs, some even approached the finance ministry to get the deadline pushed, despite Sebi giving the corporates over two years to comply.The rule was aimed primarily at improving the corporate governance structure of listed companies. It wanted to separate the board and the management of the top 500 listed companies. In most of the developed world, the board of the company and the management are separate where the board oversees the management.The rule was framed following recommendations by the Uday Kotak Committee on corporate governance that was set up by Sebi in 2016 and gave it final report in 2017. In May 2018, Sebi had introduced the rule that required all the top 500 listed companies in India to separate the post of chairman, who should be non-executive and the post of MD or CEO, who would be the top executive of the company. In several Indian companies the chairman of the board is also the executive head of the company.According to a gazette notification dated January 10, the new date for implementing this rule is April 1, 2022 from the earlier deadline of April 1, 2020.According to data on board structure of top 500 listed companies, nearly half have already separated the chairman and the MD/CEO posts. Despite opposition from some of the top corporate houses and some PSUs, recently two of the sensex companies announced their intentions about separation of the two posts.On January 2, TOI reported that Wipro was on course to make the position of its chairman non-executive. Currently Rishad Premji, from the promoter family, is the executive chairman of the company. In December, home grown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra said that Anand Mahindra , currently the executive chairman, will give up his executive role on March 31, 2020.However, Sebi has also been receiving several representations from corporates and industry trade bodies to postpone the rule due to higher compliance costs at a time when the economy is struggling.Several top lawyers and industry bodies welcomed the decision. However, there were some who were not happy with the decision. Makarand Joshi, partner, MMJC & Associates, a corporate compliance firm, said that the companies that have implemented the change in board structure without waiting for last date, might feel little unfair with this postponement. “The tendency to postpone any change in law has developed a habit amongst stakeholders to wait till last date and see if there is any postponement or deferment. However, at times, such postponements of the last date also lead to duplication of efforts and waste of time,” Joshi said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73236267,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-565813,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-defers-decision-to-spilt-cmd-post/articleshow/73236275.cms
23,['14/01/2020'],"Sabarimala will get precedence, CAA and Article 370 can wait: Supreme Court","This story is from January 14, 2020

NEW DELHI: A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Monday indicated that adjudication of the faith vs fundamental rights issue arising from women’s entry into the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple and mosques would take precedence over hearing of petitions challenging the validity of Citizenship (Amendment) Act and scrapping of J&K ’s special status under Article 370 .

The bench, headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, said, “Sabarimala is a older problem and it will be decided first. CAA and Article 370 issue pending before other benches will be decided later.”

The CJI’s observation came when senior advocates Indira Jaising and Rajeev Dhavan said deferring the hearing on faith vs fundamental rights issue could clash with the hearing on petitions challenging CAA and scrapping of J&K’s special status, both pending before different benches, and make it difficult for advocates who are also engaged to argue the latter two issues.

A bench headed by the CJI had entertained a large number of petitions challenging the validity of CAA and had asked the Centre to file its response by January 22, the next date of hearing. A five-judge bench headed by Justice N V Ramana was scheduled to resume hearing on January 21 on a bunch of petitions challenging the validity of the Centre’s August 5 decision to strip J&K of its special status under Article 370 and divide it into two UTs.

The nine-judge bench hearing the faith vs fundamental rights issue has many judges who are part of the other two benches scheduled to hear the CAA and Kashmir issues.

25,['14/01/2020'],"New academic session begins, but teachers, students boycott","This story is from January 14, 2020

NEW DELHI: Confusion prevailed on JNU campus on Monday as teacher and student bodies rejected the university administration’s call to resume classes.

The JNU Teachers’ Association ( JNUTA ) said that there was no question of starting the winter session when virtually no exams were held in the monsoon semester. The administration, in turn, issued a notice to the teachers for not carrying out their duties. As a result, even as all schools opened, there were no classes. JNUSU, too, issued a boycott call.

In the morning, JNUTA members raised slogans against vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar, blaming him for the violence that had erupted on the campus on January 5. They alleged that Kumar was involved in several discrepancies and called for his ouster, a demand they again raised at a meeting with MHRD later in the day.

Bikramaditya Choudhary, a teacher, said: “When exams for the monsoon semester have not taken place, how can there be a question of starting the winter session?”

Earlier in the day, the administration came out with an advisory and urged teachers to resume classes in the interest of students. It claimed that 12 deans and seven chairpersons of special centres had appealed to students and teachers to “refrain from any activity that would hinder the conducive atmosphere in the functioning of the university”. However, there was no clarity on the identity of these deans and chairpersons.

Dean of School of International Studies, Ashwini Mohapatra, a member of the breakaway JNU Teachers’ Federation, claimed that classes did not happen even though a few students did turn up. The administration said the appeal was issued after two JNUTA office-bearers announced a “non-cooperation” plan. “The above call for non-cooperation not only goes against the efforts of the administration for restoration of normalcy on campus and resumption of academic activities, but also reflects the intention of JNUTA to disrupt normal functioning of the university (sic),” it said, adding the new semester had begun with registration of more than 5,000 students.

26,['14/01/2020'],HC appointments: SC rejects govt’s stand,"This story is from January 14, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Centre failed in its attempt to dissuade the Supreme Court from judicially examining the delay on the government’s part to appoint HC judges long after the collegium headed by the CJI recommends names for such appointments.

On the Centre’s note submitted through AG K K Venugopal on Friday, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and K M Joseph said, “In substance, what is stated is that appointment of judges in high courts is an administrative matter between the executive and the judiciary and falls within the domain of the Supreme Court collegium and, thus, it should not be examined on the judicial side.”

The judges expressed pain over government’s failure to appreciate that the purpose of the bench was to ensure that appointments aren’t held up by more than six months.

Justices Kaul and Joseph said, “We are both pained and in disagreement with the stand sought to be taken (by the Union government) as it does not appreciate the endeavour in the present proceedings which is limited in its very character. We are not examining as to who is to be appointed as HC judge and on what consideration. We are re-emphasising our endeavour, in the first instance, is only to see that where all stakeholders are on the same page, the appointments should go through in a total period of six months.

“We reiterate that we are putting this burden on the attorney general to sort out this problem in the larger interest of the judicial process in view of the concern we had expressed on the last date and we would expect the AG to revert on this aspect.”

Terming the vacancy position in the HCs as huge, and noting that this is impeding speedy dispensation of justice, the bench said, “We cannot countenance a situation where the working of HCs is brought to almost a grinding halt by large inadequacy in the number of HC judges as a number of HCs are working at only 50% strength. The appointments (of HC judges) in the last year being the same as retirement, it has left 37% vacancy on an all-India basis.”

The bench had suo motu taken up the task of expediting appointments to HCs and on December 6 had asked the Centre to look into the inordinate delay in considering appointment of 100-odd names for HCs recommended by the collegium.

As reported in TOI on December 7, the bench had said, “The government is bound by Supreme Court judgments on appointment of judges, but is not following them”

NEW DELHI: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Monday ordered an investigation into alleged violations of competition law by India’s largest online retailers Amazon and Flipkart .The allegations include exclusive launch of mobile phones, preferred sellers on the marketplaces, deep discounting and preferential listing/promotion of private labels.The order for the probe comes against the backdrop of trader communities across the country levelling several allegations of violations of FDI in e-commerce, along with the ones mentioned above against the online giants. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which is spearheading a nationwide stir against the e-commerce giants called the order by CCI “historic”.“The Commission is of the opinion that there exists a prima facie case which requires an investigation,” said the order.The complaint against the companies was filed by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, a group representing small- and medium-sized businesses. Among other things, the complaint alleged that several of the e-tailers’ preferred sellers, such as Cloudtail and Appario Retail on Amazon India and Omnitech on Flipkart were affiliated with or controlled by the companies themselves, either directly or indirectly.“We are currently reviewing the document. The Flipkart group is fully compliant with all applicable laws and FDI regulations” said Rajneesh Kumar SVP & chief corporate affairs officer at Flipkart Group said.CCI’s decision comes ahead of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ’ visit to India later this week, during which he is expected to meet senior government officials.“We welcome the opportunity to address allegations made about Amazon; we are confident in our compliance, and will cooperate fully with CCI,” an Amazon India spokesperson said.“The Commission perused the prices for different smartphone brands sold through Flipkart and Amazon, i.e. original price and discounted price. It was observed that certain smartphone brands/models are available at significantly discounted price on these platforms and are sold largely through the sellers identified, by the Informant, as the platforms’ ‘preferred sellers’.

30,['14/01/2020'],Parliament canteen may soon go fully veg,"This story is from January 14, 2020

NEW DELHI: IRCTC , a subsidiary of the Indian Railways , may soon be told to pack up as caterers to the Parliament canteen. The race for its replacement seems to be narrowing down to private brands, Bikarnerwala and Haldiram — choices that may mean the menu available for the MPs will only be vegetarian.

IRCTC has, in recent months, faced growing concerns over the quality of its fare served in Parliament and subsidies offered, triggering a demand for fresh caterers for the complex.

TOI has learnt Bikanerwala and Haldiram, in addition to the government-run ITDC, are among the key contenders considered to replace IRCTC. The final decision is likely to be a toss-up between Bikanerwala and Haldiram, sources say. In the absence of a parliamentary food panel, LS Speaker Om Birla is likely to decide on the matter.

The Parliament menu has been much discussed, not the least for low rates which have now been revised, with certain items like biryani , chicken cutlets and fish and chips seen as signature dishes. On the simpler side, khichdi and pongal and sliced fruits and juices have been the healthier and tasteful options.

But if Haldiram or Bikanerwala assume charge, it will also mean the Parliament fare will turn vegetarian since both companies do not serve non-vegetarian food. Sources said no formal decision has been taken yet, but change appears imminent in light of Birla’s emphasis on several occasions that quality of food requires improvement and subsidies need to go, perhaps as early as the upcoming Budget session.

The changes will also have a trickle down effect on prices of food in Parliament canteens which are accessed by all MPs, Parliament staffers, security personnel, media as well as all visitors.

At present, IRCTC receives sizeable subsidies from Parliament that covers costs of cutlery and plates, apart from the space in which the caterers operate their kitchens. Roping in a private service provider, it is learnt, will move the burden of cooking and serving food from the Parliament’s shoulders to that of the service providers in its entirety.

It is expected that the giving up of subsidies alone will result in annual savings of approximately Rs 17 crore, and the new caterers will be asked to sell food on a ‘no profit-no loss’ basis.

During the winter session of Parliament in 2019, lawmakers from all parties had agreed during a Business Advisory Committee where Birla moved a proposal asking them to give up the subsidy in Parliament canteens. The rates of food served in Parliament canteen were last revised in January 2016.

Clarification

IRCTC, a public sector undertaking under the Indian Railways, does not independently control Parliament canteens, its CMD M P Mall clarified to TOI. Though the company supplies manpower when Parliament meets, it is Northern Railways which services and manages Parliament canteens.

“Since Northern Railways has deficiency in the number of staff, IRCTC sends staff. They remain under NR’s administrative control during Parliament session. We are an independent, commercial enterprise with no management control of the Parliament canteens,” Mall said.

TOI had reported on Tuesday that the administrative control of Parliament canteens will change hands from the railways to private enterprises Haldiram or Bikanervala in a report titled ‘Parliament canteen may soon go fully vegetarian’.

31,['14/01/2020'],More e-tailers doing away with OTPs,"MUMBAI: Many e-commerce platforms and mobile apps are set to do away with the second-factor authentication of one-time passwords (OTPs) for regular customers on payments up to Rs 2,000, making online transactions quicker and smoother.Flipkart has already done so, and others like Swiggy and ride-sharing apps are about to follow. A key driver for this has been the phased relaxation of rules by RBI—most recently last Friday—on one-time passwords. The central bank had allowed banks to facilitate transactions without OTP for online transactions so long as the merchant can verify the customer.Puneet Jain, senior vice president in charge of Paytm’s payment gateway said his company is empowering merchants to accept credit card payments without OTP, subject to a one-time consent. “Another recent innovation is the enabling of recurring payments. We are now letting customers authorize such payments through the unified payment interface (UPI) in addition to cards and wallets,” he said.Paytm’s payment gateway, which is a part of One97, claims to have 40% market share in volume of transactions. It is the largest gateway on e-commerce platforms such as IRCTC and food delivery and lifestyle apps.Visa has facilitated checkout without OTP by developing ‘Visa Safe Click’ which uses other factors like device authentication to make the process more seamless, according to T R Ramachandran, India head of the payments company. “While it may not require OTP it uses other forms of second-factor authentication and eliminates points of friction, such as cart abandonment, connectivity and incorrect passwords, and transforms the payment experience into a faster, secure and seamless one,” he said.According to Jain, recurring payments which were few in India are suddenly on the rise. One of the drivers has been streaming services like Netflix. “Another use case that is building up is for pre-authorised payments. This facility enables customers to book a service like a bike rental where the amount is debited after the usage,” said Jain. Earlier it was the startup which took the risks as there was little it could do if the card was declined after the service. With pre-authorisation, they do not face any such risk.Unlike in India, many overseas e-comm platforms and apps do not require second-factor authentication. Uber started its ride-hailing business in India using its international payment gateway to facilitate transactions without OTP—only to be blocked by RBI, which said second-factor authentication was mandatory for payment for services and goods. This gave wallets like Paytm a boost. Now while requirement of OTP has been withdrawn, RBI has put the onus on banks and merchants to verify the user.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73236616,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-139931,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/more-e-tailers-doing-away-with-otps/articleshow/73236614.cms
32,['14/01/2020'],Retail Inflation Rate: Food prices drive retail inflation to 5.5-year high,"NEW DELHI: Retail inflation rose to a 65-month high in December on the back of soaring vegetable prices as food inflation hit an over six-year high, prompting economists to predict that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will continue with its pause on interest rates.Date released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Monday showed retail inflation as measured by the consumer price index rose to an over five year-high of 7.4% in December, higher than the previous month’s 5.5% and way above the 2.1% recorded in December 2018.This is the highest since 7.4% recorded in July 2014. For the first time since July 2016, the inflation figure shot past the 6% upper band of the central bank’s comfort zone.The latest numbers comes as a double whammy for the BJP government, which is battling slowing growth that is estimated at an 11-year low of 5%.The overall inflation rate is the highest since the BJP government took office in May 2014. The Modi administration was so far successful in containing inflation at low levels for a significant period, providing headroom to the central bank to cut rates to accelerate growth.The key reason for the sharp spike has been prices of vegetables and pulses. Vegetable prices rose an annual 60.5%, largely driven by onions, and prices of pulses by 15.4%. The government expects overall inflation to moderate in the coming months as supplies improve.The food price index rose 14.1% during December, the highest in the new series, which was introduced in January 2014. It was the highest in nearly six years since November 2013 when it had soared to 15.4% in the old series which had 2010 as the base year, according to official data.Core inflation, which is minus food and fuel, too rose marginally to 3.7% in December, compared with 3.5% in the previous month.Inflation in rural areas was at a 5-year high of 7.3% during December while in urban centres it was at a 6-year high of 7.5%. The data showed that 12 out of the 22 states and union territories had higher inflation than the overall inflation of 7.4%.The inflation numbers come ahead of the February 1 budget which is expected to unveil fresh measures to boost growth.Economists attributed the sharp spike to higher vegetable prices, which are at a six-year high, while pulses shot up to a three-year high.“While food inflation has ascended to double digits, it is not broad-based. It is specifically in vegetables, followed by pulses, which are behind the surge. If you exclude them, food inflation is still 5%, which is a 33-month high,” said DK Joshi, chief economist at ratings agency Crisil .Economists also said a sharp spike in the transport and communication segment added to the inflationary pressure. They said they expect inflation to remain at elevated levels although moderation in onion and potato prices may help ease overall inflation.“Considering the higher than targeted level of inflation and the fiscal challenges with regard to the government surpassing its fiscal deficit target, the RBI is likely to maintain its status quo on the policy rates in the forthcoming policy meeting. Going ahead, RBI’s monetary policy would remain contingent on the inflation trajectory and the government’s fiscal stance,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings.In Video: Retail inflation jumps to 7.35% in December",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73236632,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-379062,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/food-prices-drive-retail-inflation-to-5-5-year-high/articleshow/73236621.cms

NEW DELHI: BJP working president J P Nadda is set to assume charge as party president next week with home minister Amit Shah stepping down from the post, a development that will mark the start of a fresh chapter for the party.

The schedule for election of the new president will be released soon, party sources said and expressed confidence that Nadda will be elected unopposed. This will bring to an end Shah’s tenure as party chief after he succeeded defence minister Rajnath Singh in July 2014. Shah was elected to a second three-year term in January 2016 after he completed Singh’s interrupted term.

The nomination date is January 20 and if, as expected, there will be no other claimants, then Nadda will be declared as BJP president. Shah’s tenure as party chief has been significant as he emerged the de facto number two in BJP after Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Nadda takes charge at a demanding juncture where the government and party have been facing protests from the opposition and mobilisation over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and incidents like the violence in JNU.

BJP has also lost some momentum in the wake of Shiv Sena ’s desertion in Maharashtra , a sub-par result in Haryana and loss in Jharkhand . BJP now faces a stiff test against AAP in Delhi.

Nadda was health minister in the first Modi government.

34,['14/01/2020'],New Army deputy-chief to look after ops &amp; strategic planning post-Doklam,"NEW DELHI: The 1.3 million-strong Army has cleared the decks for creation of the new crucial post of deputy chief (strategy), as part of the overall restructuring and flattening of the Army headquarters, by shifting the entire Rashtriya Rifles (RR) directorate from New Delhi to the Northern Command in Kashmir.The need for the new post of Deputy Chief of Army Staff (Strategy) or DCOAS (S) was acutely felt during the 73-day troop confrontation between India and China at Doklam near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction in June-August 2017, which saw the two rival armies move additional infantry battalions, tanks, artillery and missile units towards the border.The DCOAS (S) will have the directors-general of military operations (DGMO), military intelligence (DGMI), operational logistics (DGOL), perspective planning (DGPP) and information warfare (DGIW) under him at the Army HQs. “As of now, an ad hoc committee is constituted to handle operations, plans, logistics etc during a crisis like Doklam. There is no unity in structure and chain of command among different verticals. In the future, the five DGs will jointly brief the DCOAS (S) during any major crisis,” said a top official.The Union Cabinet is likely to soon approve the plan to restructure the Army HQs, which is largely “revenue-neutral” and does not include any new additional post of a Lt General. “The DCOAS (S) post will be created in lieu of the DGRR post. The overall aim is to remove duplication, cut non-operational flab and provide single-point advice to the Army chief. It will bring integration within the Army, and then with the Navy and IAF,” he added.As was earlier reported by TOI, this Army HQs’ restructuring will lead to the shifting out of over 100 officers to operational field formations. In another significant change, the existing post of DCOAS (planning and systems) will transform into the DCOAS (capability development and sustenance), with all capital and revenue procurements under him. “Ammunition procurements, for instance, were being handled by different capital and revenue verticals during the Doklam crisis,” said another officer.Similarly, the DCOAS (information systems and training) will change to DCOAS (information systems and coordination). The post of DGMT (military training), in turn, will be subsumed under the Army Training Command, whose HQs will be shifted to Meerut from Shimla. The RR directorate at the Udhampur-based Northern Command will now be headed by a Major General or ADG.

NEW DELHI: Accusing the Modi government of polarising politics, several opposition parties on Monday sought to intensify protests against CAA-NRC-NPR and said Republic Day should be observed across the country by reading the Constitution to challenge the government’s effort to “undermine” India’s foundational values.

Referring to the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Population Register and National Register of Citizens as inimical to vulnerable sections of society, the opposition demanded withdrawal of CAA and the “immediate stoppage of the nationwide NRC-NPR”. It also asked opposition chief ministers to dump NPR.

The deliberations, however, were not attended by important non-NDA parties like Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party , BSP, AAP, UPA member DMK and new ally Shiv Sena, making it a UPA-Left affair. The participants laboured the point that 20 parties came together on CAA-NRC-NPR, a larger cause than pinprick concerns over intra-party bickering

The attack on NPR follows a Congress Working Committee resolution to oppose it on the ground that its objectives were suspect. NPR was launched by the UPA government while NDA has added some queries like date and place of birth of parents. The government has said the NPR collects socio-economic information that helps the Centre and states frame welfare and other policies.

“All chief ministers who have announced that they will not implement NRC in their state must consider to suspend the NPR enumeration as this is a prelude to NRC,” a joint statement by the opposition leaders said. It also said Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary on January 23, and Mahatma Gandhi ’s day of martyrdom on January 30, should also be celebrated with gusto to highlight communal amity, in opposition to what the anti-BJP axis called the Modi regime’s blatant bid to create a religious divide.

The call to tap three important days on the ‘nationalism’ calendar within the Republic Day week is intended to differentiate the opposition from government-led celebrations, reflecting the political and social split on CAA-NRC-NPR.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi accused the Modi government of misleading people on CAA and NRC and unleashing “unprecedented turmoil” in the country — a “reign of oppression, spreading hatred and trying to divide people along sectarian lines”.

“The nation has watched in horror at the BJP-orchestrated assault on JNU coming so soon after what happened in Jamia Millia Islamia , BHU, Allahabad University, AMU and other institutions of higher learning in other parts of the country,” Sonia said while addressing opposition leaders.

The gathering also castigated the Centre for failing to steer the country out of the economic morass. “The PM and the home minister have no answers and want to divert the nation's attention from this grim reality by raising one divisive and polarising issue after another,” Sonia said.

NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Left leaders Sitaram Yechury and D Raja, JMM leader and Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren , LJD chief Sharad Yadav, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party head Upendra Kushwaha, RJD neta Manoj Jha, National Conference neta Hasnain Masoodi, besides Congress veterans Rahul Gandhi, Ghulam Nabi Azad , Ahmed Patel and former PM Manmohan Singh were among those who attended the meeting.

37,['14/01/2020'],Will decide larger issue of women’s entry into religious places: Nine-judge SC bench,"This story is from January 14, 2020

NEW DELHI: A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Monday said it will only examine the larger issue of faith-based customs violating fundamental rights of women and lay down guidelines for judicial scrutiny of petitions raising issues relating to clash of faith with fundamental rights.

The important clarification means the bench will not pronounce on petitions seeking a review of the SC’s order overturning the Sabarimala shrine’s tradition of not permitting the entry of female worshippers in the 10-50 year (menstruating age) group that had led to widespread protests in Kerala.

The bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, M M Shantanagoudar, S Abdul Nazeer, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant said it will decide the larger issue and not hear arguments on pleas challenging SC’s September 28, 2018, judgment quashing the ban on entry of women in the specified age group, a tradition based on the presiding deity Ayyappa being a “naishtik brahmachari”.

On November 14 last year, a five-judge bench led by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi by three to two majority had not disturbed the September 28 judgment allowing the entry of women of all ages but asked a seven-judge bench to evolve guidelines for deciding cases involving clash of fundamental rights and faith emerging from women’s entry to temples, mosques and agiyaris. CJI Bobde decided to constitute a nine-judge bench for the purpose.

In the meanwhile, the Left-led Kerala government’s enthusiasm for implementing the SC order has also waned after it suffered a rout in the Lok Sabha elections. Thereafter, the government has stopped enforcing the SC order taking the view that it will be guided by law and order considerations.

The SC on November 14 had said reference of the issue to a seven-judge bench was needed as the possibility of a clash between faith and fundamental rights emerged not only in the Sabarimala case but also in pending petitions “regarding entry of Muslim women in dargah/mosque, Parsi women married to non-Parsi men into agiyari and practice of female genital mutilation (FGN) among Dawoodi Bohras”.

The nine-judge bench led by CJI Bobde brushed aside strenuous arguments from Indira Jaising that the court should not decide any issue other than the Sabarimala temple entry case as no other petitions were placed before the larger bench. “Personal laws for Hindus, Muslims and Parsis are governed by three different regimes. The issues pertaining to Islam and Parsis are not before the court,” she said.

The bench said it would call for hearing the petitions raising issues relating to entry of women into mosques and agiyaris. Encouraged, senior advocate Vikas Singh said the court should also include Ashwini Upadhyay’s PIL challenging the validity of ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among Muslims. The bench refused to include ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy among a section of Muslims in its scrutiny.

The SC said individual issues — entry of women into Sabarimala, mosques and agiyaris as well as FGN — would be decided by smaller benches on the basis of guidelines, which would be devised by the nine-judge bench after hearing all parties.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta pleaded the nine-judge bench should go strictly by the reference order of the five-judge bench and not include additional issues like ‘nikah halala’ and polygamy. Though the bench was ready to commence hearing, senior advocate A M Singhvi requested it to give the counsel three weeks to prepare written submissions on the larger issue. The bench agreed to give three weeks to counsel to hold meetings among themselves for finalisation of issues to be dealt with by the court.

Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan intervened and said it was not the task of the SC to tell people what constituted essential religious practice in their religion.

PATNA: Close on the heels of a medicine trader’s murder, a 45-year-old property dealer, Ramashish Singh, was shot dead by armed criminals over a property dispute at Mirchi village under the Bypass police station area in Patna City sub-division late on Sunday night.

Police said a group of armed criminals attacked Singh while he was returning home from Patna on a motorcycle around 10.30pm. Singh was rushed to the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) where he died during treatment late in the night.

SHO of Bypass police station Ajay Kumar said on Monday that Singh was intercepted by the criminals at a stone’s throw distance from his house on Mirchi-Marcha road. “Locals as well as family members of Singh rushed to the spot and took him to the hospital,” the SHO added.

Altogether 15 people, including Puttu Singh, Vijay Singh and Mangal Chand, have been named as accused in the FIR. The SHO said six of the accused have already been arrested and raids were on to nab others.

According to police, Singh also worked for a private insurance company. Sources said Singh’s nephew Upendra Singh alias Upendra Yadav was also killed by criminals in Patna City area on October 2, 2019.

Singh’s relatives said the former had sought police protection apprehending threat to his life. “No action was taken against the people who had threatened him with dire consequences. He was also pursuing the case related to the murder of his nephew in the court,” a close relative of Singh said on the condition of anonymity.

Police said the property dispute between the Singh and his neighbour Ram Ekbal Singh has so far claimed at least four lives. “Land prices at Mirchi village, hardly 3km south of NH-30, have shot up in the past few years. As a result, cases of land dispute have increased in the area,” the police added.

On Saturday night, a veterinary medicine shop owner, Shailendra Kumar Singh (48), was shot dead by a gang of armed criminals at Alamganj in Patna City.

The two murders within 24 hours in Patna City have created panic in the area. “Murders have become a routine affair in Patna City,” said Umesh Kumar, an RJD functionary from the area.

SURAT: In an interesting case rarely seen in the country, a couple, parents of three boys , who wanted a girl child , abandoned their newborn just because the fourth child too happened to be a boy. However, police were able to locate the parents who had abandoned their newborn baby on January 5, 2020 in the city. The couple was subjected to DNA testing by cops so as to match it with that of the baby to find out if they are the boy’s real parents.

The newborn boy was found in the bushes of Tapi embankment at Vanzara Vas, Tekra Faliya at Singanpore village of Chowk Bazaar on January 5. An offence under IPC section 317 was registered at Chowk Bazaar police station. Police received information about a pregnant woman of Vanzara Vas, who had not been seen for a week before the abandonment of the child.

Representative image

PATNA: The long-pending demand of foot overbridges and underpasses across the city for pedestrian crossing is not likely to be fulfilled soon as the projects have been delayed due to several reasons.

Tenders for foot overbridges at Rupaspur, Rajendra Nagar and in front of Patna zoo and two underpass escalators near Samrat Ashoka Convention Centre were floated by Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited (BRPNNL) and Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited (BSRDCL) last year to ease traffic and pedestrian movement across the busy roads. However, due to delay in commencement of work, the projects will take another one year.

BSRDCL managing director Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the construction work on FoBs will commence in four-five months. “Due to lack of budget last year, the construction work got delayed. However, the expenditure on the FoBs has been included in 2020 Budget,” he said.

Agarwal said work on two foot overbridges to be constructed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) at Anisabad and Mithapur-New Bypass Road will commence this year.

Principal secretary of road construction department (RCD), Amrit Lal Meena, said the foot overbridges and underpasses in the state capital will be constructed soon. “Several measures are being taken in a bid to ensure road safety in the city. The department will soon start construction at all proposed locations,” he said.

An official said tenders for preparing a detailed project report (DPR) of FoB at Rupaspur near the Jagdeo Path-Sheikhpura Mor flyover and another near Rajendra Nagar overbridge were floated last year. “The DPR will be finalized this week. Construction work on both the FoBs will commence simultaneously in a couple of months,” he said.

Meanwhile, pedestrians are often seen facing a tough time while crossing the road at the culmination point of Jagdeo Path-Sheikhpura Mor flyover and Rajendra Nagar overbridge. “The Jagdeo-Path Sheikhpura Mor flyover is one of the busiest flyovers in the city. There’s non-stop vehicular movement on the flyover and underneath it throughout the day and it becomes really difficult to cross the road,” said Simran Singh, who was waiting to cross Bailey Road near Jagdeo Path.

Pedestrians also find it difficult to cross Bailey Road near gate number I of Patna zoo and the Gandhi Maidan-Danapur Road near Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre and SK Memorial Hall where government and non-government events are organized regularly. Two underpass escalators near the convention centre were scheduled to be constructed by March this year. “The road in front of Bapu Sabhagar is dangerous for pedestrians to cross,” said Vikas Kumar, a resident of Ashok Rajpath.

Kite flying is at peak during Uttarayan and two days after January 14 in the city

SURAT: Large-scale campaigns run by people to save birds during Uttarayan have begun to yield results in the city. NGOs and Surat Nursing Association say calls for rescue of birds that had reduced nearly by half last year have further decreased in 2020. Similarly, number of injuries to humans by kite manja too have reduced by half.

Kite flying is at peak during Uttarayan and two days after January 14 in the city. Every weekend of January before Uttarayan, people in large number fly kites which injure birds.

“Birds fly out of their nests in the early morning and evening hours and this proves fatal for many of them as people would be flying kites then,” said Darshan Desai, a volunteer of Prayas, an NGO which workers for the welfare of the birds.

“We started a campaign a few years ago and asked people, especially school students, not to fly kites in the early morning and evening hours for the safety of birds. A large number of school students have taken oaths not to fly kites. The result is we received nearly 50 per cent less calls of bird injuries than we had received in 2018.”

Suman Desai, a young graduate from Vesu, said, “I was crazy about kites. When I was in school I used to spend at least an hour on my terrace after Diwali until Uttarayan just flying kites. However, fatal injury to a dove due to the manja of my kite made me restrain my passion. Now I don’t fly kites.”

Surat Nursing Association started its helpline for birds and humans on Monday. SNA president Iqbal Kadiwala said, “We have treated just four humans this year against 12 two days before Uttarayan last year. Only two calls about injured birds were received by us this year. Younger generation is more into saving lives of birds than flying kites for pleasure.” SNA’s Sahastrafana Charitable Trust has been running a clinic for the birds and humans injured by manja for the past 13 years.

46,['14/01/2020'],No intent to defame: Tata; Nusli Wadia drops suits,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Nusli Wadia (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata’s conciliatory statement that he had “no intention to defame” industrialist Nusli Wadia saw the latter agree before the Supreme Court on Monday to drop civil and criminal defamation cases he had filed against Tata three years ago.

The court said in its order, “Although Wadia was aggrieved by the statement of Tata, in view of the statement made by Tata that there is no intention to defame Wadia, which is in accordance with the (Bombay) high court’s observations, the petitioner (Wadia) states that he withdraws this petition as well as the civil defamation suit against Tata.”

Wadia had initiated criminal defamation proceedings against Tata and other directors of Tata Group companies after he was ousted as director from Tata Steel, Tata Chemicals and Tata Motors for his support to Cyrus Mistry, who was voted out as executive chairman of Tata Sons in 2016.

Wadia had termed the resolution — purportedly drafted by Tata and others and circulated in the boards of these companies — defamatory as it questioned his bona fide and independence. He had also filed a Rs 3,000-crore civil defamation suit against Tata and others.

On Tata’s plea, the Bombay high court had quashed the criminal defamation proceedings, while recording that there was no intention on Tata’s part to defame Wadia through the contents of the resolutions circulated among the board of directors for his removal.

On January 6, a bench of CJI S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant had urged the two top industrialists not to waste time litigating against each other and bury the hatchet. Tata’s counsel A M Singhvi had expressed willingness to make a statement that there was no intention to defame Wadia, as found by Bombay HC, while quashing the criminal defamation case against Tata.

The court had suggested reconciliation between Tata and Wadia while hearing the latter’s appeal against the Bombay HC order. But a counsel’s statement that Wadia would pursue civil defamation case even though he was agreeable to drop the criminal defamation proceedings made the bench adjourn the hearing and ask Wadia’s counsel C A Sundaram to take instructions from his client about withdrawing all defamation cases against Tata.

On Monday, Wadia’s counsel C A Sundaram read out a one-paragraph statement which conveyed that Wadia would drop both criminal and civil defamation proceedings if Tata made a statement that there was no intention to defame him in the 2016 resolutions.

As and when such a statement was made by Tata, Wadia was ready for an amicable settlement of the issue and “shall withdraw the present petition and the civil suit for damages”, Sundaram said. Singhvi said since the HC had already given a finding that there was no intention to defame Wadia, Tata had no reservation to record a statement to that effect before the SC.

RAJKOT: Two murder cases were reported from Ronaj village of Kodinar taluka in Gir Somnath district and Karachaliapara locality of Bhavnagar in the past 24 hours. No accused were arrested in the cases.

In Ronaj village, Ayub Sheikh (45) was stabbed to death by Raghu Dahima on Sunday evening. “Dahima is a bootlegger. Sheikh had asked Dahima to stop the illegal liquor trade in his village and had threatened to approach police, if he did not comply,” said G K Bharwad, inspector with Kodinar police station.

On the fateful day, Sheikh was going on a pilgrimage to a dargah in Velan village of Kodinar taluka. On his way, Dahima allegedly abducted him in a car, killed him and dumped his body by the roadside. Sheikh’s body was later recovered from the outskirts of Pipalva village in Kodinar taluka.

Dahima was booked on the complaint of Sheikh’s son Ebu Sheikh. “There are more persons suspected to be involved in the murder, apart from Dahima. We have launched a manhunt for Dahima,” said Bharwad, adding that Sheikh’s body had been sent for forensic postmortem in GG Hospital in Jamnagar.

The second murder was reported from Karachaliapara locality of Bhavnagar where Pravin Chudasma (35) was stabbed to death by Jiger Bambhania and Kishan Makwana.

According to police, the murder was the result of an altercation that had broken out between Chudasma and Bambhania. On December 31, Bambhania was creating a drunken ruckus. When Chudasma told him to calm down, an altercation broke out between them.

“Nursing a grudge against Chudasma, the accused waylaid him near a water supply plant in Karachaliapara locality and dealt him stabbing wounds. Chudasma was rushed to Sir T Hospital in Bhavnagar where he succumbed to injuries. We have launched a manhunt for Bambhania and Makwana,” said A J Rana, inspector with Bhavnagar C division police station.

Representative image

KOLKATA: An elderly couple was found dead inside their Narendrapur apartment on Monday morning. Police suspect the woman, who neighbours and relatives said was bed-ridden, had a natural death while her husband committed suicide in shock. The couple’s relatives said the two of them mostly stayed home ever since their only son drowned some years ago.

The bodies of Tapan Banerjee, 73, and his wife Bakul, 67 — who were former state government employees — have been sent for post-mortem. Cops have, however, ruled out foul play.

Locals said the couple’s maid raised an alarm after receiving no response to repeated knocking. Neighbours informed Narendrapur police, who broke open the door to the Prantik Abasan housing complex flat and found the two dead.

Sovon Roy, a neighbour, said the Banerjees’ maid had served them dinner on Sunday evening before she left for the night. “Bakul was bed-ridden for the past few years. Tapan was also ill and stayed within the complex if he did venture out.

Tapan’s nephew Sudip said, “Once a week, I used to visit my uncle and aunt. They survived on their pensions.”

Sources said the preliminary probe revealed some medicine next to Tapan’s bed, which he was never prescribed. Cops suspect he took them after losing his wife and killed himself. Baruipur SP Indrajit Basu said an investigation has been started.

Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Monday said design for extension of Patna Museum has been prepared and bidding process for the construction work has also begun. He said the alignment for an underpass to connect Patna Museum and Bihar Museum will also be finalised soon.

Talking to reporters at his chamber at the state legislative assembly, Nitish said the upgraded and extended Patna Museum will be “magnificent”. “Three additional layers of galleries are being constructed at the back end of the museum. All artefacts kept in the storage of the museum will be displayed in the new galleries,” the CM said.

Sources in art, culture and youth affairs department said apart from extension work, the galleries at the existing building will also be redesigned to give a new look to the museum. Sources in the building construction department, on the other hand, said the new building will be a U-shaped structure, covering the left, right and back side of the existing main structure of the museum.

The new structure will have office space, digital galleries, exhibit area, conference hall, orientation room and space for K P Jayaswal Research Institute. The extension and redevelopment of the museum is proposed to be done with an expenditure of Rs 138 crore.

51,['14/01/2020'],Blackstone to buy majority in Allcargo for Rs 380 crore,"This story is from January 14, 2020

(File photo)

MUMBAI: Global asset manager Blackstone will buy a majority stake in the warehousing business of Allcargo Logistics , the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday. It will invest Rs 380 crore through equity and debentures in the warehousing unit as it bets on the demand for large storage spaces from e-commerce players like Amazon and Flipkart.

Allcargo, founded by Shashi Kiran Shetty in 1993, will retain a small share in the warehousing business, the company said. The share sale in the warehousing unit follows Allcargo’s proposed buy of a 45% stake in express distribution company Gati for Rs 416 crore.

Blackstone will route the investment in Allcargo’s warehousing business through BRE Asia Urban Holdings. Through the investee company, Blackstone plans to develop industrial and logistics parks in key Indian markets. The introduction of a single indirect tax — goods and services tax — for the whole nation has also boosted demand for warehouses from consumer-focused companies to ensure speedy and last-mile conveyance of products.

The transaction, said Allcargo, will be completed over 12 months and will be subject to the achievement of certain business performance milestones prescribed in the documents executed by Blackstone.

Allcargo’s stock closed at Rs 104 a share, up over 4% on the BSE in a strong Monday market. The warehousing unit plans to develop 3 million sqft of storage centres in the country, which will ramp up its existing portfolio of 6 million sqft of logistics parks. “The Indian warehousing sector is on an expansionary curve backed by a robust regulatory environment and the government’s thrust in boosting manufacturing, e-commerce and organised retail. The industry has emerged as an attractive investment destination for global investors,” said Shashi Kiran Shetty, chairman of the Rs 6,800-crore-plus Allcargo Logistics.

Private equity funds have invested more than $1 billion in warehousing units in India in the last three years compared to zero investment in 2015 and 2016 combined. Recently, Adani announced the purchase of 40% in Snowman Logistics for Rs 296 crore.

52,['14/01/2020'],"Will talk to Union IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad for ban on porn sites, says Bihar CM Nitish Kumar","This story is from January 14, 2020

Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar said on Monday that he will personally talk to Union law and information technology (IT) minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on his demand of imposing a ban on pornography websites.

Speaking to reporters in his chamber at Bihar legislative assembly, Nitish said many “wrongdoings” (read rape) with women are happening due to the influence of pornographic websites.

Earlier, Nitish had written a letter to PM Narendra Modi on December 16 last year seeking ban on pornography websites. He had stated in the letter that incidents related to grave crime against women were being reported from almost every state and in many cases, videos of such crimes were being circulated on social media as well.

“It has been seen in many such cases, that the accused persons do wrong things (read rape or sexual assault), film the act and upload it to internet. Even the websites hosting such videos make money based on higher number of visitors. But all this needs to be stopped,” he said.

Nitish said he recently read about Ravi Shankar talking about ban on pornography websites. “I will speak to Ravi Shankar about ban on pornography the next time he is in Patna. Many such incidents (sexual assault and crime against women) are happening because of pornographic contents,” Nitish said.

The CM seems to have to proper reasons to be concerned. As per the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, altogether 651 rape cases were reported in Bihar in 2018. The report further stated that total number of cases of crime against women increased from 14,711 in 2017 to 16,920 in 2018.

Nitish in his letter to PM had mentioned about several provisions in Information Technology (IT) Act-2000 (as revised in 2008), which can be used to curb pornographic and immoral contents on the internet. Nitish claimed that such provisions were not getting implemented effectively.

State information and public relations department minister Neeraj Kumar said Section 67 of the IT Act criminalizes the use of IT means for display of pornographic content. “Pornography has been seen to incite sexual assault against women. Besides, in many cases, the culprits film the wrongdoings and use it for blackmailing victims so that they don’t complain to police. Thus, it is high time pornography is banned in the country. I believe such a proposal is already in consideration of the Centre, given the fact that Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu formed an informal group of MPs last month to study the issue of pornography on social media and its effect on children and society as a whole,” he said.

Varanasi: After almost a month of violent protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act and NRC, the Mau district on Monday witnessed a peaceful anti-CAA protest meeting of leaders from opposition parties, including Congress and Samajwadi Party, near Mau collectorate under the banner of Mau Nagrikta Manch (MNM).

Responding to the call of MNM, the supporters of opposition parties gathered at collectorate with the flags of their political parties as well as the national flag. Following a demonstration, they started their meeting.

Addressing the gathering, convenor of MNM Arvind Murti held the CAA as “against the soul of the Constitution and vision of Swami Vivekanand of an inclusive society”. He said that a country, which had given shelter to tortured people from different countries and religion, cant accept the CAA. He said that they had gathered to save the Constitution.

In his address, SP leader and former nagar palika chairman Arshad Jamal alleged that CAA was not only unconstitutional but also illogical due to giving communal colour to it. If you have to give citizenship, he said, it should be given without any discrimination on the basis of religion.

Mentioning NRC, he said that it is shameful that people of this country will have to prove their citizenship on their own soil. He said that the people of country will never give such proof and the government will have to roll back its decisions on CAA and NRC.

54,['14/01/2020'],NGOs oppose govt bid to revive Human dam project near Tadoba,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Nagpur: The irrigation department, which is trying hard to push the controversial Human dam project near Tadoba, was reluctant to follow conditions recommended by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).

Over 1.5 lakh trees will be felled and 1,926-hectare forest land in the functional corridor of Tadoba-Ghodazari diverted if the project is implemented. The dam project was discussed on Monday at an expert committee meeting called by its chairman and principal secretary (forest) Vikas Kharge at Mantralaya.

PCCF (wildlife) Nitin H Kakodkar, irrigation department executive engineer Arvind Gedam, deputy conservator (buffer) G Guruprasad, non-government members BNHS director Deepak Apte, Satpuda Foundation chief Kishor Rithe and Eco-Pro president Bandu Dhotre were present. NGO members unanimously opposed the project.

The irrigation department is pushing the project claiming to provide irrigation and drinking water to 160 villages in Saoli, Pombhurna, Mul and Chandrapur. Officials have also linked the project with checking Naxalite problem in Chandrapur.

“The dam will completely block corridor between Tadoba-Ghodazari-Umred-Karhandla-Navegaon-Nagzira. Since 2007, 140 human deaths have been reported in Chandrapur district alone and the dam would further flare up man-animal conflict as the situation then and now is completely different with number of tigers going up. There may be at least 175-200 tigers in Chandrapur district alone,” said environmentalist Debi Goenka.

On August 19, 2014, NTCA had set up a four-member committee for site appraisal of the project. In its November 2014 report, NTCA had asked to shift the project 5km upstream from the present site in Sirkada, which 3.5km from Tadoba.

The other two recommendations included procuring private land to restore structural corridor of 3-4km downstream and convert it into forest by planting native species. The panel had also suggested options to develop lift irrigation schemes, barrage, small dams etc instead of a major dam.

“However, the irrigation department is not ready to follow any of these conditions claiming the project will become unviable. At Monday’s meeting, irrigation officials were ready to create an artificial corridor up to 1km only,” said sources.

The project was conceived in 1983 and construction started in 1984-85. The work stopped because of violation of Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980. Conservationists have questioned need for the project after 36 years, especially when 20-22 major and minor irrigation projects like Gosikhurd, Ghodazari, Asolamendha and Nalleshwar have already come up in Chandrapur district.

Human or inhuman

* The cash-strapped state government wants to put Rs3,000 crore project on the track

* The major dam will lead to felling of 1,50,791 trees

* NTCA report gives a negative opinion about the project

* As per original plan, Human was initiated basically to supply 132 mm3 water to CSTPS but now a separate dam has been built on Irai river for it

* SC’s central empowered committee (CEC) raised concerns about the project in 2008

* Then minister Jairam Ramesh on September 8, 2009, too advised not to pursue the project

* In 36 years, entire landscape has changed with several small and medium dams coming up

* The project claims to irrigate 40,000-hectare land with 5,089 hectares submergence and 1,925 hectare of forest diversion

MUZAFFARPUR: A special cell team of Delhi police arrested Md Saidullah , kingpin of a drug racket, from his rented accommodation in Gobarsahi locality of the town on Sunday and took him to the national capital.

SHO of Sadar police station Mithilesh Kumar Jha said an inspector-rank official of the special cell of Delhi police had sought the help of local police to arrest Saidullah, a resident of Malda town in West Bengal. “Since Saidullah was not wanted in any criminal case in the district, we just assisted the Delhi police in nabbing him. He was carrying a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head announced by the Delhi police,” Jha added.

A source in the police department said Saidullah was arrested on the basis of electronic surveillance. “His two accomplices were arrested by Delhi police nearly a week ago with a consignment of 10kg of heroin. They informed the police about Saidullah’s hideout in Bihar. The electronic surveillance helped Delhi police zero in on Saidullah,” the source added.

The posters were removed within a few hours by the civic officials

SURAT: Just when a Swachh Survekshan team is expected to arrive in the city for citizen feedback and do spot inspection on cleanliness, some miscreants have pasted dustbins placed at various places with posters that intend to show them as donation boxes of BJP. The posters are mischief by the miscreants to score political points for their masters who are engaged in a bitter political fight with the BJP which controls the civic body, sources said.

On Monday morning, these posters were found pasted on the dustbins placed outside Majura MLA Harsh Sanghvi’s house, police commissioner’s office, district collector’s office, science centre, Surya Palace, Rajni Corner, Kings Corner in Citylight, Joggers’ Park on Ghod Dod Road, West Field Tower, St Xavier’s School and Vanita Vishram School. Posters were pasted on several dustbins placed in Limbayat and Udhna too. The posters were removed within a few hours by the civic officials.

Opposition Congress councillors earlier alleged BJP had illegally awarded litter collection contracts and was involved in litter box purchase scam too. Some people have questioned the cost at which these dustbins have been purchased. These dustbins were purchased in 2019 before the Swacch Survekshan team visited the city. The purchase was done at different levels by respective zones as per their requirement. Many of these dustbins were found damaged some time ago and solid waste spilled out of them on the roads. Majura MLA Harsh Sanghvi had questioned the purchase of the dustbins and demanded the agency that supplied the substandard material dealt with strictly.

Sanghvi said, “This gimmick shows the mindset of the miscreants and also of those with whom they are aligned with.”

Ashish Naik, deputy commissioner of health, SMC, has expressed his displeasure at this political gimmick. “This is work of some miscreants. We hope these elements desist from spoiling the city’s image in the country.”

SMC sources said this could be the handiwork of activists of student wing of a political party in the opposition.

Some panel members complained that such protests had set a wrong precedent and hurt the image of Delhi Police ... Read More

NEW DELHI: Opposition MPs in the parliamentary committee on home affairs on Monday objected to the use of force by the Delhi Police against students and suggested that efforts be made to engage protesting students through peaceful means like dialogue.

While a source insisted that no specific incidents — be it the police action in Jamia Millia Islamia in view of violent anti-CAA protests or the recent clashes in JNU — were raised during the deliberations by the panel, it is learnt that the police action against students came in for criticism. Some members suggested that the agitating students could have been dealt with in a more mature manner, since they are not criminals.

The meeting of the standing committee, chaired by Congress MP in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma, was attended by senior officers of the home ministry (home secretary Ajay Bhalla was excused from appearance) and police brass of Delhi, Haryana, UP and Rajasthan. While Delhi Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik is said to have given a detailed briefing to the committee on the state of crime in the capital, the DGPs or their representatives from neighbouring states brought up the crime/law and order issues arising due to their proximity to the capital.

The opposition party MPs are said to have objected to frequent invoking of prohibitory orders (Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code) in Delhi, which bars assembly of more than 4 persons, as a precautionary measure against protests. Section 144, it was pointed out, often becomes a prelude to police action. Some members of the committee insisted that the provision be used sparingly, particularly where students are involved.

The Delhi Police chief was also questioned by the parliamentary panel on protests staged by police staffers in November following their scuffle with lawyers. The siege outside the police headquarters, which had seriously affected traffic movement, was seen by some as an act of indiscipline by members of the force. Some panel members complained that such protests had set a wrong precedent and hurt the image of Delhi Police.

60,['14/01/2020'],Cops set to launch free ‘Suraksha’ taxi service,"This story is from January 14, 2020

PATNA: In view of the frequent incidents of cash loot in Vaishali, police have decided to provide ‘Suraksha’ taxi service to people, who carry a sum of more than Rs 1 lakh with them.

Newly-appointed SP, Gaurav Mangla, told this newspaper on Monday, “The free facility will be made available in a day or two. We will also issue a toll-free number for the purpose. All you have to do is make a call on the number and provide details like place where the ‘Suraksha’ taxi has to reach, mobile number and destination where the cash is to be taken under police escort.”

Mangla, who was transferred from Munger to Vaishali two weeks ago, pointed out that each police station in the district would have at least two patrolling vehicles. “One of them will be used as a ‘Suraksha’ taxi. If required, we will provide additional police force and vehicles to the person concerned,” he said.

The SP revealed that the service was launched in Munger on an experimental basis and the response was overwhelming. “Although the transaction of cash in Munger was not as frequent as it is in the Tirhut range, the facility worked wonders and incidents of cash loot reduced substantially there,” he said.

Mangla has also made the provision of proper monitoring of the new facility. “The service is meant only for common people. In no case, it will be provided to private companies as there is a separate guideline for them so far as transportation of huge cash is concerned. Police escort is provided to such companies at a fixed rate,” he clarified.

Vaishali, considered to be a crime-prone district under Tirhut range, recorded altogether 98 incidents of robbery and 83 of road robbery from January to September, 2019. However, no incident of bank robbery or bank dacoity was reported from any part of the district. Altogether 60 people were killed in the district during the period. However, majority of them lost their lives while resisting loot and robberies.

“The new system will act as a deterrent to criminals involved in cash loot in the district,” said Chandra Bhushan Mishra, a businessman based in Hajipur.

PATNA: A ‘Traffic Park’, which has been developed in an area of 2,500 feet at Shaheed Veer Kunwar Singh Azadi Park on Hardinge Road, was thrown open to visitors on Monday.

Built by the state transport department, the park will create awareness about issues like traffic rules, emergency services, signals, road safety through lane markings, zebra crossings, diversions and road signage among people.

Transport department officials claimed that approximately 502 people, including kids, youngsters, and old people, visited the park on Day 1.

“This is the only ‘Traffic Park’ designed specially for children to make them learn traffic rules in an interesting manner. There are miniature roads, zebra crossings, and traffic signs here,” transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal told this newspaper on Monday.

NCC cadets will explain traffic rules to the visitors in a simplified way by holding workshops and enacting street plays. Agarwal said, “This park is our gift to Patnaites during the Road Safety Week. There will be no entry fee, but a register will be maintained to keep a record of the visitors.”

Meanwhile, Patnaites hailed the transport department’s initiative. Gardanibagh resident Vidya Sahay said, “My son loved spending time here and was interested in learning traffic rules. I will bring him again.”

Many young couples and collegians also showed interest in learning traffic rules and regulations. Manisha Singh, a student of Magadh Mahila College, said, “It has been six months since I started riding a scooty, but do not know the traffic rules well. I will be back soon.”

6-day ‘corrective’ classes for violators: The transport department is likely to conduct six-day corrective classes for traffic violators at Sultan Palace from Tuesday.

“To ensure that they attend the classes, we will seize their drive licences and vehicles.

Yogi Adityanath

GAYA: The district unit of BJP has left no stone unturned to ensure large turnout of people at Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s public meeting at Gandhi Maidan here on Tuesday. Dhanraj Sharma, the BJP’s Gaya district unit chief, is overseeing preparations for the meeting.

Senior minister and Gaya town MLA Prem Kumar has also oiled his election machinery to make the event a big success. The UP CM’s meeting is the first major exercise of the BJP in the state to create mass awareness on Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Yogi is scheduled to reach the airport here in an aircraft of Uttar Pradesh government around 11am. He will go straight to the meeting venue from the airport.

According to BJP sources, the event will also test the mobilisation capacity of party ticket aspirants for the upcoming assembly elections.

Asked about the arrangements for the UP CM’s meeting, Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said it being a party programme, the role of the administration was limited to the maintenance of law and order. “Sadar SDO and city DSP are in regular touch with the meeting organisers,” said the DM.

Separate teams of the NSG and UP police have also arrived here to coordinate with district officials. The UP police team is led by a DIG rank officer.

Meanwhile, Omair Khan alias Tikka Khan, convener of the ‘Samvidhan Bachao Morcha’, has appealed to the district administration to depute adequate number of policemen near the ongoing dharna site in the Shantibagh locality of the town during the UP CM’s visit. Hundreds of men and women are observing indefinite dharna at Shantibagh here since December 29 against the CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Their excitement knew no bounds when they finally selected and purchased kites and manjha they had chosen

JAIPUR: Be it five-year-old Mohammad Irrfan or 65-year-old Ramesh Khandelwal, both were equally excited when they reached a kite shop at Haldiyon Ka Raasta on Monday. Their excitement knew no bounds when they finally selected and purchased kites and manjha they had chosen.

Similar scenes were witnessed across the city on the eve of Makar Sakranti as revellers went on a shopping spree on the eve of the kite festival. Handipura near Ramganj Bazaar, which is the most sought after place of kite lovers, was choc-a-bloc throughout the day. The market is flooded with kites from Rampur, Hathras, Bareilly and Moradabad.

“The momentum picked up from afternoon. We had to bring extra bunches of kites from the godown,” said Naeem Qureshi, a wholesale kite dealer from Bareilly.

He added there had been a sudden rise in the sale as most people indulged in last-minute shopping. “Ab to ek do din ka dhandha reh gaye, pehle maheenon chalta thaa (Now the business is confined to one or two days, earlier it used to be a month-long affair),” said Liyaqat Ali, a 65-year-old wholesale trader at Haldiyon Ka Raasta.

Interestingly, some of the traders had placed loud speakers to make announcements “Chinese manjha mangkar sharminda na karen” (Don’t embarrass us by asking for Chinese manjha).

“We have urged our customers not to leave the manjha the moment a kite is snapped as it might endanger lives. It is better to roll the rest of manjha after kites snap so that it doesn’t harm any person,” said a trader. Likewise, heavy rush was seen at shops selling feeni, gajak and other items across the city. Majority of the traders would be allowed to keep their shops open till midnight. “Traders of Walled City, who run shops throughout the day, usually start buying kites after closing their shops. So, keeping our kites shops open in the night is very necessary,” said a trader.

NAGPUR: Considered a rare occurrence, an albino sambar deer was recorded at Navegaon National Park in Gondia district last week.The solo herbivore, estimated to be around 7-8 months, was sighted by forest guard Hitendra Anarse during patrolling. “Our staff was surprised to see the white animal with pinkish ears resting in the dense grassy patch,” said Poonam Pate, deputy director, Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve ( NNTR ).“Generally, probability of an albino sambar in protected areas is less. The said animal seems to be unique with complete loss of pigmentation. Hence, its skin was pale compared to other members of its species,” said Pate.She added, “Generally, sambars are social animals and live in groups but experts say such albino animals are not accepted by the groups and hence was sighted alone.”There are very few records of albino sambar. Dr Bahar Baviskar, a wildlife veterinarian, recalls he had sighted such sambar in Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR), Maharashtra, in 2013.“It is not necessary that mothers reject such fawns. Otherwise, it would not have reached 8 months of age without the mother’s care,” Dr Baviskar said.“But it is true that albino animals may face obstacles in nature as in some cases they have trouble finding a mate, and their inability to camouflage themselves makes them more vulnerable to predators,” Dr Baviskar said.Another wildlife vet Dr Prayag HS says, “Non-mammal animals can also be albino, but because they can produce other pigments in addition to melanin, they may not appear fully white.”WHAT IS ALBINISM?In mammals, albinism occurs when an individual inherits one or more mutated genes from both parents that interfere with the body’s production of melanin, the main pigment that determines the colour of skin, fur and eyes. The production of melanin occurs within melanocytes, specialized cells that are present but not fully functional in albino mammals.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73238976,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-535675,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/albino-sambar-sighted-in-navegaon-national-park/articleshow/73235410.cms

Kolkata: Magician PC Sorcar’s daughter, actor Moubani, has become the city’s latest victim of phishing after she found herself trapped by a “suave, English-speaking” fraudster over phone last Saturday and lost Rs 17,000 from her bank account linked to a payment gateway. The 32-year-old lodged a complaint on Monday and said she was duped by the way the fraudster spoke to her, claiming to be an executive associated with a payment gateway. “It was only after I had transferred Rs 17,000, that I realized I was conned,”Sorcar told TOI.

According to her, on Saturday, she was in the middle of an audition when she received a call from a person who introduced himself as a representative of Paytm who said she had won an LED TV worth Rs 49,000 from Paytm Mall in a lucky draw. “Since my childhood, I have won a number of lotteries and so I thought my lucky charm had worked again. He said I needed to deposit Rs 5,000 to a Paytm account to redeem the prize. He gave me an account number and I transferred the money,” she said.

Sometime later, the man called again and said that the gift had been processed, but Sorcar had to pay Rs 11,999 as GST. “I was sceptic, but he sent me a number of documents, like his Aadhaar card, PAN card and his office ID, over WhatsApp and said the money would be refunded immediately. I was foolish to believe him and again transferred the money,” Sorcar said.

However, when the man called again asking for more money, the actor realized she was being conned. “The man said the last transaction had been cancelled and asked me to send the money again. I realized he was taking me for a ride and demanded my money back. He first changed his voice and posed as a senior official, but when I threatened to report the matter to the cops, he disconnected the call,” she added.

Cops have issued an alert asking payment-app users to be aware of fraudsters who pose as customer service operators of companies. The conmen steal money either by phishing or by gaining access to the victims’ mobile screens after getting them to install a screen-sharing app and gaining access to card details.

Police investigate inside the prison premises on Monday

Rajkot: In a huge embarrassment for police , four undertrials accused in serious crimes escaped from Limbdi sub-jail in Surendranagar district by breaking the lock of their barrack, climbing a 12 foot wall and cutting the b arbed fence in the cover of darkness on Sunday night.

Police said the accused, identified as Vijay Karapada, Mayursinh Jadeja, Ramesh Karu and Dinesh Shukla, made good their escape from barrack number-2.

“The crime was detected when the jail authorities checked the barrack and found its lock had been severed and the doors wide open. We have cordoned off various exit and entry points of Limbdi and intensified manhunt for the accused,” said D B Basiya, Limbdi deputy superintendent of police.

Karapada, a native of Ramparada village of Muli taluka in Surendranagar district, was jailed for attempt to murder and loot offences registered against him. Jadeja, a resident of Bidada Padar village of Mandvi taluka in Kutch district, was imprisoned for the offence of a loot in Sayla. Karu, a native of Bhimasar village of Anjar taluka in Kutch district, was jailed in a case related to abatement of suicide. Shukla, a resident of Railnagar in Rajkot, was incarcerated in a murder case of Than. Shukla had fled from Limbdi police station in 2014 and was rearrested.

“The incident occurred when renovation work was underway inside the jail premises. The accused made the most of the situation after finding a ladder lying against the 12-feet high wall. The accused used the ladder to climb the wall and then cut the barb wires with the cutter,” said Basiya.

While the four inmates were fleeing, two others — Bharat Rojasara and Viram Jejharia — did not run away as they were fast asleep. “Rojasara and Jejharia said they were sleeping at that time and didn’t even know what was happening,” said S S Varu, sub-inspector with Limbdi police station.

The four prisoners were booked on the complaint of jailer Parbat Goyal. There are 49 under-trial prisoners lodged in Limbdi sub-jail at present.

The maximum number of 21,711 kidnapping and abduction cases were reported from Uttar Pradesh, followed by 11,443 in Maharashtra. Mizoram, Sikkim and Nagaland with 3, 74 and 90 cases respectively were at the bottom of the table on such crime. In Bihar, average 8.4 persons per one lakh of the population were kidnapped or abducted against average 8 in the country.

Compared to previous year’s data, Bihar witnessed an increase of 1,456 incidents of kidnapping and abduction from 2017 when the number of such cases stood at 8,479 while it was 7,324 in 2016.

Even if a child is missing or a boy runs away before his exam result, or someone elopes in a love affair, a kidnapping case is registered. It is actually a good sign for us that most of the cases are registered. However, the figure for professional kidnapping is only in double digit,” said Vinay. He further said that around 90,000 FIRs were lodged in 2000, around 2.65 lakh in 2018 and the figure for 2019 is likely to cross 3 lakh.

Altogether 62 children were murdered in Bihar in 2018 and 10 of them were below six years of age, while 17 were between six years to 12 years and 35 above 12 years but below 16 years. Altogether 2,094 incidents of sexual harassment against children were reported in 2018, while 252 children were booked under The Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act, 2000 & 2015.

As per the NCRB figures, major crime against children in 2018 across the country were related to kidnapping and abduction (44.2%) and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (34.7%), including child rape.

Tejashwi Prasad Yadav

PATNA: Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Monday hit out at CM Nitish Kumar for “delaying” discussion on Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the House. Talking to reporters outside the state assembly, Tejashwi said Nitish should have immediately discussed CAA in the House instead of waiting for the next session, when it will be “too late”.

“The CM should have extended the special session of the House by a day and discussed the issue. Gazette notification on CAA has already been published and people will suffer now. The CM’s delaying tactics shows his intentions. He is tired and in a compromising mode. He is with BJP and RSS just to hold the post of CM,” Tejashwi, who was also accompanied by his elder brother Tej Pratap, said.

Tejashwi also criticized the CM for “changing” his stand on Article 370. “Nitish had earlier said that he was against Article 370. However, he took U-turn later. There is a huge difference between what he says and what he does,” Tejashwi said.

On Nitish’s demand for caste-based census, Tejashwi said instead of paying lip service, the CM should meet home minister Amit Shah and discuss the issue. “It is another matter whether Shah will meet him or not as we all know Nitishji’s political stature now,” Tejashwi said, adding that he will embark on a yatra in Seemanchal region from January 15 to protest against implementation of CAA and proposed introduction of NRC in the country.

PATNA: The state is likely to witness a wet spell of varying intensity in the next couple of days owing to the western disturbance coming from central Rajasthan and adjoining Pakistan, which led to severe cold day conditions at many places, including Patna, on Monday.

If the weathermen are to be believed, people of the state will not get any respite from prevailing biting cold conditions till January 15.

The Skymet Weather bulletin predicted on Monday that the weather in eastern India may remain dry, but east Uttar Pradesh and parts of Bihar may experience light to moderate rainfall on January 16 and 17 and again on January 19.

“The fresh cyclonic circulation that has already arrived in the country will cause rain in the northern plains and snowfall in the northern hills. Due to this system, parts of Bihar will continue to face cold day conditions at least for the next 48 hours,” the Skymet report said.

Minimum temperature in Patna dropped by 0.7 degree Celsius on Monday and settled at 8.2 degrees C. Maximum temperature, on the other hand, slipped to 14 from 15.2 degrees Celsius recorded on Sunday, leading to shivering cold in the city.

The highest maximum and lowest minimum temperatures of 21.2 degrees Celsius and 6 degrees Celsius were recorded at Dehri and Gaya and Dehri, respectively, on Sunday.

According to Patna Meteorological Centre, dry weather would prevail in most parts of the state over the next 48 hours. “Cold day and severe cold day conditions were observed at some places and moderate to dense fog at many places in the state in the last 24 hours. The skies in Patna were covered with cloud due to formation of moisture in the atmosphere,” the local Met office said.

The Indian Meteorological Department has also issued forecast for dense fog at few places in the state over the next two days. “There would be significant change in night temperature in Bihar over the next 24 hours,” it said.

Flights delayed due to poor visibility: A chaotic situation prevailed at Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport, Patna, as 18 flights were delayed by more than an hour on Monday due to poor visibility. Some other flights suffered minor delays.

Ten flights of IndiGo, seven of SpiceJet and one of GoAir were delayed by more than an hour. Flight operations at the city airport became normal after 10.45am as the minimum required visibility of 1,000m was reached at 10.20am.

Meanwhile, three Delhi-bound flights – two of GoAir (G8-2511/ 2512 and G8-231/132) and one of Air India (AI-409/410) – were cancelled on Monday due to operational reasons.

The funds will be used to augment the company's talent and technology and cement its position in the Indian market.

Plans are also on to expand reach of their freight management software in global markets including Europe and South East Asia, Jayakrishnan said.

We have grown our revenues around 3-4x in the last one year with inbound interest for our solution from both Indian clients as well as Indian operations of MNCs, he added.

Kolkata: The Kolkata Leather Complex police, on December 19, managed to bring back a 17-year-old girl from Jammu after she left her east Kolkata home to stay with a 22-year-old merchant from Kashmir on December 5. City-based doctor Jayanta Mukherjee — who helped the family get their daughter back — took to Facebook on Monday to praised the local police on Facebook on Monday.

The girl got infatuated with her Facebook friend, who lived in Kathua, after conversing with him on social media for a few months. “She was upset when the internet connection became irregular following protests over the scrapping of Article 370 in Kashmir. That was when the duo decided she would travel to Kashmir to be with him,” an officer said.

“He sent a flight ticket for Delhi and she left home. On reaching Delhi, she switched off her cellphone and met her friend. They first went to Kathua and then, a few days later, they settled in Ladakh,” the officer added.

In Kolkata, the girl’s family had lodged a missing complaint by then. “We sent a team to Jammu and the Jammu police helped us investigate the man’s residence. We then suspected she might have gone to Ladakh. The local cops helped us track her down on December 19 and she was finally handed over to her family after completing all legal formalities,” another officer said.

The cops said it didn’t matter if both of them had planned the escape together. “The victim is a minor and her consent is not important,” said an officer.

79,['14/01/2020'],Flipkart tightens returns policy on rising frauds,"This story is from January 14, 2020

(File photo)

BENGALURU: Consumers buying winter fashion and lifestyle products on Flipkart will get less time to return products as the Walmart-owned e-tailer is tightening its returns policy. Flipkart is reducing the returns window for the segment to 10 days, from 30 days earlier, suspecting fraud orders by consumers, resulting in a ‘drastic rise’ in returns.

Flipkart has communicated the change to its merchants selling these goods. This is the first such change in its returns policy with a direct impact on consumers under the new parent Walmart . Fashion is one of the top three categories driving its gross sales alongside smartphones and large appliances. In terms of margins, fashion offers the highest for e-tailers, including Flipkart.

Broadly, lifestyle and clothing were the only verticals allowing for a 30-day return or replacement on Flipkart according to its website. All the other categories allow only a 10-day period following a change in policy during 2016-17.

It is suspected that consumers, at a staggering pace, might have ordered new winter clothes and other products and then returned it weeks later after using it, pushing Flipkart to make this change in its policy, people aware of the matter said. The high rate of returns ends up adding to operating costs for both e-commerce companies and their sellers.

This is the first time Flipkart is making such changes in the fashion and lifestyle segment, one of the merchants who sells on Flipkart said. “Typically 15-20% of orders placed during an average business day are returned or replaced. This time, it must be much higher that Flipkart has spotted the trend and made this move,” this person added.

In comparison, Amazon continues to offer a 30-day return period for fashion and lifestyle products here, according to its website. Amazon too has a 10-day window for returns in segments like consumer electronics and smartphones.

“To reduce these fraudulent activities and to save you from such fraud buyers, the return/replacement policy for the below list of verticals is being changed from 30 days to 10 days,” Flipkart has told merchants. TOI has reviewed the communication. “Also note that this change has been done to protect your interest and to save you from fraudulent returns,” it added. Jackets, sweaters, sweatshirts, coats and thermals are some of the categories that will come under the new policy.

A Flipkart spokesperson confirmed the development. “To ensure that we continue to protect the interests of lakhs of sellers, especially small businesses, on our platform, we have altered the time frame of our return/replacement policy for certain lifestyle categories in line with industry best practices. This will minimise the possibilities of misuse and also drive greater efficiencies that will eventually help our sellers and bring a wide and affordable selection of products to millions of customers on our platform,” the spokesperson said.

PATNA: More than 9.5 lakh people thronged different stalls at the 10-day-long India International Mega Trade Fair , a grand shopping festival at Gyan Bhavan here, which concluded on Monday. The trade fair featured both foreign and Indian products.

The fair witnessed rush of people on all 10 days. People were seen jostling to buy the variety of products from different countries and states ranging from food, handlooms, handicrafts, home décor, electronic gadgets and lifestyle. Traders from Iran and Afghanistan had also put up their stalls.

Shahzadi Khanam, a trader from Karnataka, said, “I make handicrafts and am thankful to Karnataka government for providing me the necessary support and incentives. It has been a wonderful experience here. Buyers in Patna are extremely humble.”

Buyers too were quite excited to shop at the fair. Dhirendra Mishra, a local, said he was amused to see good quality winter wear and other items at affordable prices. “I bought handlooms and some home décor items. My wife loved the cushion covers and lacy curtains,” he said.

Kushi Kumari, a college student, who was busy selecting tote bag, said, “The dress materials at Iran shop were too good. I just could not take my eyes off. I visited the fair thrice and bought food items, electronic gadgets and kurti with matching stoles,” she said.

The organisers said the fair was aimed at promoting small, micro and medium enterprises. “This fair has become one of the most awaited events in the country,” said one of the organisers.

81,['14/01/2020'],Ex-servicemen to observe Jan 14 as veterans’ day,"This story is from January 14, 2020

PATNA: Bihar Ex-servicemen Officers’ Association (BESOA) will observe January 14 as the ‘Armed Force Veterans’ Day ’ to commemorate the selfless devotion and sacrifices of the veterans and strengthen their bond with serving personnel, BESOA coordinator Col (retd) V K Singh said on Monday.

Singh said Bihar had negligible welfare schemes for ex-servicemen as compared to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. “Though Bihar is second to Uttar Pradesh in giving about 11% manpower of its population to armed forces, most of the ex-servicemen still prefer to settle down in other states after retirement. Bihar seems to be the last choice for ex-servicemen to stay mainly due to poor facilities available in the state,” he said.

According to Col (retd) Singh, at least one lakh youths from Bihar are in the Army. They are sending Rs10 crore to 15 crore to their families in the state per month, which adds to the state economy. Indian Army is the fourth in the world in terms of numbers. Bihar, except lone Danapur cantonment, has virtually no Army station from military point of view. While there are three Regiments — Punjab, Sikh and Sikh Infantry in Punjab, even a small state like Uttarakhand has two regiments — Kumaon and Garhwal. Besides, Punjab and Uttarakahand have 20 regular battalions while Bihar has only one regiment, Singh said, adding that after bifurcation, Ramgarh cantonment is under Jharkhand and there is no Army station in Bihar located on the sensitive borders of Bangladesh and Nepal.

Though housing continues to be a major problem for ex-servicemen in Bihar, Albert Ekka memorial complex inaugurated by former President Pranab Mukherjee is lying in a dilapidated condition in Patna. Rajya and zila sainik kalyan karyalyas are also not functioning properly to benefit the ex-servicemen and war widows in the state . Process to appoint ex-servicemen as special auxiliary police (SAP) in Bihar has also been stopped for one reason or another, the BESOA coordinator said, adding ex-servicemen have thus no scope for re-employment in the state.

Col (retd) Singh reiterated the demand of Bihar ex-servicemen to build a suitable war memorial in Patna on the pattern of UP, West Bengal and Jharkhand in honour of the martyrs and ex-servicemen as “martyrs die not when they are shot, but when they are forgotten”.

HYDERABAD: Golconda police arrested 61 persons for staging a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and NRC at Towlichowki on Sunday night.

Around 100 protesters led by activist Khaleda Parveen gathered at Towlichowki cross roads around midnight and within minutes another group of women and youngsters joined them to raise slogans against CAA and NRC.

The sudden protest took the police by surprise and even though a large contigent of personnel were deployed they were unable to control the crowd and traffic at Towlichowki cross roads came to a stand still. Eventually, additional forces were pressed into service and the protesters were taken to Goshamahal stadium and later to Asifnagar police station.

“The protest did not have prior police permission and the gathering was unlawful. Hence, we have taken suo moto action against them and a case has been registered,” said inspector K Chandrasekhar Reddy of Golconda police station.

“The flash protests have an element of surprise so we have to be doubly alert,” said a senior police officer.

A case under IPC Sections 341 (wrongful restraint) and 290 (causing public nuisance) was also registered. The arrested persons were later released on bail.

The city has been witnessing several rallies in protest against CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC) every day and the police are on their toes controlling the crowds.

Mumbai: Sensex scaled a fresh all-time peak on Monday as global and domestic factors boosted investor sentiment. These were the progress on the US-China trade deal, positive index of industrial production (IIP) numbers for November, strong results by Infosys, fall in oil prices and strengthening of the rupee.

The sensex closed at 41,860, up 260 points for the day, after touching an all-time high at 41,900. The NSE Nifty too recorded a fresh high of 12,338 and closed at 12,330, up 73 points.

Dalal Street investors were enthused by the Dow Jones Index’s crossing the 29,000 mark for the first time in history on Friday and also the progress between the US and China to sign the first phase of the trade deal later this week, brokers said.

On the domestic front, the IIP for November showed an uptick of 1.8%, after showing negative growth for two consecutive months, brokers said. On Friday, Infosys kicked off the results season with a 24% jump in net profit for the October-December quarter that beat analysts’ expectations. In addition, the thawing of US-Iran tensions in the Middle East also helped the global crude oil prices come down to $65 per barrel level. This, in turn, helped the rupee strengthened from 70.94 to a dollar on Friday to 70.86 on Monday. The day’s gains, however, came on the back of muted net buying by domestic and foreign funds. BSE data showed that while FPIs recorded a net buying of Rs 68 crore, the corresponding figure for DIIs was Rs 47 crore. The day’s rally also added a little over Rs 1 lakh crore to investors’ wealth with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 158.2 lakh crore.

Among the sensex stocks, Infosys, boosted by its strong result, rallied nearly 5% on Monday and contributed nearly half of the index’s gain. Other top contributors were IndusInd Bank and HUL. Among those which limited the gains were TCS, Reliance and ICICI Bank, all closing in the red.

86,['14/01/2020'],Bihar legislature ratifies Bill to extend SC/ST quota in lower Houses by 10 years,"This story is from January 14, 2020

PATNA: Both Houses of the state legislature unanimously ratified the 126th Constitution Amendment Bill to extend reservation for SC/ST in the Lok Sabha and state assemblies by another 10 years.

The Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on December 10 and 12, respectively, last year and it was required to be ratified by at least 50% of the state assemblies before its implementation. Accordingly, a special session of Bihar legislature was called for this purpose on Monday.

Following presentation of the Bill by Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary in the state assembly, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi spoke on its different aspects and merits. “This law traces its roots to Poona Convention in 1932, which was attended by freedom fighters like Madan Mohan Malaviya. Later, it became an Act in 1935 and was implemented by the British government in 1937. But it was implemented for a short period of only two years and finally implemented in full-fledged manner with the enactment of the Constitution. It was proposed to remain effective for a period of 70 years, which is slated to expire on January 25, 2020,” SuMo said.

The deputy CM claimed that it was due to this provision of the Constitution that the 543-member Lok Sabha has 84 Scheduled Caste and 47 Scheduled Tribe members. He said since such reservation is not applicable to the 245-member Rajya Sabha, it has only 18 members from SC and eight from STs. “The number of SC/ST members in the Rajya Sabha could be 50-55, had there been a provision for their reservation in the Upper House of Parliament as well,” he said.

SuMo said the Bihar government also introduced reservation in promotion to SC and ST personnel in state services. “The matter is, however, pending in the Supreme Court,” he said.

Participating in the debate, leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said a provision should be introduced to make reservation for SC/ST permanent in the Lok Sabha, instead of extending it every 10 years. He also raised the demand for calling a special session of the state legislature for conducting caste census and the corresponding resolution to be sent to the Centre. He added that RJD will not allow implementation of recently introduced Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Bihar.

Congress legislator party leader Sadanand Singh, on the other hand, said the provisions of the Bill ensure removal of disparity in the society. “Our nation builders understood that people belonging to SC/ST sections were deprived. Accordingly, provisions were made in the Constitution to ensure representation of people from SC/ST sections in Parliament. Congress supported this Bill in the Lok Sabha and we are doing the same here as well,” he said.

Later, chief minister Nitish Kumar said the Bill has already been passed by both Houses of Parliament and he was thankful to all the political parties in Bihar for supporting it in the state legislature.

After getting ratified in the state assembly, the Bill was presented in the state legislative council by its acting Chairperson Haroon Rashid and was approved following a voting on it.

Patna University

PATNA: Patna University (PU) vice-chancellor (VC) Rash Bihari Prasad Singh on Monday called upon the teachers of physics to enrich the emerging disciplines of agrophysics and econophysics by utilizing their knowledge and create new vistas for human welfare.

Inaugurating a two-week refresher course on ‘Recent Advancement in Physical Sciences’ organized jointly by the PU UGC-HRD Centre and physics department, the VC said that physicists must devise ways for creating awareness in the society towards environmental protection and ecological balance. “The basic principles of physics may also be utilized in the field of social sciences for ameliorating the sufferings of human beings,” he added.

Speaking as the chief guest of the event, state information technology secretary Rahul Singh pointed out that India’s share in the field of qualitative research and patenting is less than 2%. He said, “A country becomes powerful only through its intellectual property. The universities and research organizations need to direct their attention towards generating more patents if India has to emerge as a hub of inventiveness.”

PU pro-VC Dolly Sinha said teachers should always work in the best interest of students and devote extra time in the process, if needed. She asked the teachers to teach a subject in such a manner that they evoke the students’ interest.

PU science faculty dean and Patna Science College principal S R Padmadeo pointed out that techniques of physics are gradually finding their way in biological sciences. “Works on protein and molecular genetics in biophysics could become possible only through the application of knowledge of physics,” Padmadeo said.

While PU physics department head Surabhi Prasad welcomed the guests, centre’s director Chandrama Singh proposed the vote of thanks.

Course coordinator Shankar Kumar said, “Altogether 40 physics teachers from different parts of the country are attending the course.”

PATNA: One male rhinoceros ‘Nagshanker’ died due to cardiac arrest at Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, commonly known as Patna Zoo, on Monday. The zoo is now left with 11 rhinos, including six males and five females.

The 14-year-old rhino had come from Assam State Zoo-cum-Botanical Garden under an animal exchange programme on December 6 last year.

A group of five vets from Bihar Veterinary College and doctors of the zoo conducted the post-mortem of the deceased in the presence of zoo director Amit Kumar.

The preserved viscera samples of the animal were later sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI)-Uttar Pradesh and Regional Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory (RDDL)-Kolkata for further tests.

After the post-mortem, the rhino was buried at a funeral ground near the Botanical Garden on the zoo premises.

The zoo director told this newspaper that the rhino was not suffering from any health ailments. “The main reason behind the death will be confirmed only after IVRI and RDDL conduct the tests,” he said.

A condolence meet was also held on the zoo premises.

The statue was accidentally damaged and not vandalized, say cops

Rajkot: Surat diamond baron and promoter of multi-crore Hari Krishna Exports, Savji Dholakia , appeared before Lathi police in Amreli district in connection with the fake complaint of Mahatma Gandhi’s statue desecration that was lodged by his close aide on January 4.

Dholakia was summoned for questioning after spot examination and recovery of some audio clips which revealed that the statue was accidentally damaged by a tractor owned by the diamantaire’s NGO - Dholakia Foundation - several days before January 4. Kanak Patel, Dholakia’s aide, and others had allegedly created a fake crime scene and resorted to the drama of submitting a memorandum of the Amreli superintendent of police (SP) demanding immediate arrest of the vandals.

Police officials said that Dholakia could not produce any documents regarding permission taken to install this and many other statues surrounding the lake developed by the NGO near Lathi town.

Talking to TOI, Premsukh Delu, assistant superintendent of police, said, “Dholakia’s statement was recorded for three hours. He produced the document of the tractor which is owned by his father and driven by his labourer at the time of incident.”

“Dholakia claimed he had no knowledge of the fake complaint and the management of the lake is handled by Kanak Patel,” Delu said.

Police will now verify the call record details to verify Dholakia’s statement.

Dholakia told police that he had handed over a portion of the lake to the government after the development. He produced the documents of his land ownership of 100 bighas of the 200 bighas. “We will now ask district inspector of land records (DILR) to ascertain the portion of land encroached,” Delu said.

Police have still not registered a formal complaint regarding the furnishing wrong information to the public servant.

90,['14/01/2020'],Sebi gives top listed cos 2 more yrs to split CMD post,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Mumbai: Markets regulator Sebi on Monday extended the deadline by two years to April 1, 2022 for the top 500 listed firms to separate the roles of chairman and MD/CEO. There was intense pressure from top corporates and PSUs — some even approached the finance ministry — to get the deadline pushed, despite Sebi giving them over two years to comply.

The rule was aimed primarily at improving the corporate governance structure of listed companies. The regulator wanted to separate the board and the management of the top 500 listed companies. In most of the developed world, these two are separate and the board oversees the management.

The rule was framed following recommendations by the Uday Kotak committee on corporate governance that was set up by Sebi in June 2017 and gave its final report in October of that year. In May 2018, Sebi had introduced the rule that required all the top 500 listed companies in India to separate the post of chairman, who should be non-executive, and the post of MD or CEO, who would be the top executive of the company. In several Indian companies, the chairman of the board is also the executive head of the company.

A gazette notification dated January 10 says the new date for implementing this rule is April 1, 2022 from the earlier deadline of April 1, 2020. According to data on the board structure of top 500 listed companies, nearly half have already separated the chairman and the MD/CEO posts. Despite opposition from some of the top corporate houses and some PSUs, recently two of the sensex companies announced their intentions about separation of the two posts.

On January 2, TOI reported that Wipro was on course to make the position of its chairman non-executive. Currently, Rishad Premji, from the promoter family, is the executive chairman of the company. In December, homegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra said that Anand Mahindra, currently the executive chairman, will give up his executive role on March 31, 2020.

However, Sebi has also been receiving several representations from corporates and industry trade bodies to postpone the rule due to higher compliance costs at a time when the economy is struggling.

Several top lawyers and industry bodies welcomed the decision. However, there were some who were not happy with it. Makarand Joshi, partner at corporate compliance firm MMJC & Associates, said that the companies that have implemented the change in board structure without waiting for the last date may feel that the postponement is unfair.

“The tendency to postpone any change in law has developed a habit among stakeholders to wait till the last date and see if there is any postponement or deferment. However, at times, such postponements of the last date also lead to duplication of efforts and a waste of time,” Joshi said.

PATNA: Ruling JD(U)’s women cell on Monday decided to gift a sapling to the mother of every newborn girl child in rural areas with motivation to grow it in her neighbourhood in the name of her daughter.

“As per the decision, the village and panchayat-level volunteers of our women cell will henceforth approach all such mothers and convince them to raise saplings in the name of their newborn girls as the grown up tree will remain as memory after the daughter’s marriage,” JD(U)’s women cell state president Shweta Biswas told TOI while briefing about the resolution passed at state-level meeting held at JD(U) office here on Monday.

She said the cell has decided to execute this strategy only in villages because of the availability of saplings and free land in rural areas. “Moreover, majority of women in urban area are educated and they are aware about the need of environment protection and saving the girl child. We need to educate rural women,” Biswas, who is also an elected member of the Patna District Board, said.

In another resolution, the cell decided to ensure full participation of women in the proposed statewide human chain on January 19. “All district and block presidents of the cell have been given the task to convince women to participate in the formation of human chain,” she said.

Biswas said the JD(U) women cell has altogether 51 organizational districts in Bihar. The committees have so far been formed in 46 out of their 51 districts. The women cell presidents from 41 districts and dozens of state-level office-bearers attended the meeting.

JD(U) state general secretary Anil Kumar informed the participants about the Nitish government’s different schemes for women welfare.

Other prominent leaders who spoke on the occasion were Anjum Ara, Kiran Ranjan, Khushbu Kumari, Punam Jha and Veena Yadav.

After the meeting, the women leaders did a rehearsal outside the state JD(U) office on how to participate in the proposed human chain on January 19.

KOLKATA: A week ago, on January 5, the owner of a reputable jewellery store chain approached Bhowanipore police after internal investigations showed that some gold ornaments in his store had been replaced by fakes. A week later, on Sunday, a salesman from the store was arrested for the crime.According to cops, Dum Dum resident Sanjib Chakraborty — who had been working at the store for seven months — had removed multiple gold items and “invested” them with a gold-loan firm. The cops are certain he was helped by others who made replicas of the originals. “We have taken Chakraborty into police custody and are questioning him on his modus operandi and other gang members,” said an officer.The store owner, Sumit Dutt, had complained that jewellery, including two gold chains, a couple of rings and buttons, had been replaced by fakes. During investigation, all employees of the jewellery shop were questioned for a prolonged period and the CCTV footage from the shop was examined minutely. But it was one ingenious step taken by the owner and senior staff that helped cops in the probe. “The customers often ask for the exact weight of the finished product. The management then began asking salespersons about the exact weight of the product they were selling to crosscheck if there was a gap between the actual weight and what was mentioned in the tag. Several items being sold by Chakraborty began showing serious differences,” explained an officer.Chakraborty’s statement, too, was contradictory. “His body language and certain postures recorded by the CCTV camera aroused suspicion and he was arrested. His house was searched, but, initially, nothing was recovered. After days of interrogation, he revealed the location of the ring — hidden in the prayer room, in a small envelope meant for homoeopathic medicine,” an officer said.“Chakraborty disclosed that the rest of the jewellery had been mortgaged by him at a gold loan finance firm. We have now seized his accounts,” said an officer.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73242371,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-206665,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shop-asst-replaces-jewellery-with-fakes-invests-in-gold-loan-firm/articleshow/73235348.cms

(File photo)

BENGALURU: Oyo founder Ritesh Agarwal has told staff that the focus of the company is on profitability as it is looks to balance “the speed of our growth with our operational capabilities” along with driving governance and leveraging technology to improve operations. The development comes as Oyo has started cost-cutting, laying off 10% of the Indian workforce, about 1,000 employees, according to sources briefed on the matter.

The development comes as the SoftBank-backed hospitality major has come under global scrutiny for the way it runs its operations, including overstating properties listed on its platform and alleged bribes. Oyo has also faced protests from hotel owners in India and China over payments. Over the last two years, Oyo has expanded aggressively to global markets including China, Europe and the US, armed with billions in funding from SoftBank Vision Fund .

“I have no hesitation in admitting that, growing at the pace at which Oyo has in the past few years, we sometimes went ahead of ourselves and pressure-tested our organisation at multiple levels. This year, we are taking steps to address this,” said the 26-year-old Agarwal in a mail to employees. He added that the company remains subject to external audits and is “making significant investments in compliance, training and governance”.

Agarwal said in his mail that “some roles at Oyo will become redundant as we further drive tech-enabled synergy, enhanced efficiency and remove duplication of effort across businesses or geographies”. “As a result, we are asking some of our impacted colleagues to move to a new career outside of Oyo.” While the total number of layoffs are currently pegged at 1,000, some reports have pegged it at over 2,000 employees in India out of a base of 20,000. Globally, Oyo employs over 20,000 and it is also expected to undertake layoffs in markets like China. TOI had reported about layoffs at Oyo and other unicorns on December 23.

The move could also see Oyo trimming its network of over 10,000 hotels in India as the focus will be on “profitable locations and buildings and avoid growth that dilutes our margins” and reducing “operating costs”.

Oyo Hotels & Homes reported losses of Rs 1,308 crore for the first three months of the current financial year ending in June, according to a valuation report filed with the Registrar of Companies (RoC). For the financial year ending March 2019, it reported a net loss of Rs 2,384 crore compared to Rs 360 crore a year ago. During this period, the company’s revenue grew to Rs 6,456 crore as against Rs 1,413 crore at the end of March 2018.

BAREILLY: Villagers in UP’s Shahjahanpur scrambled with canisters, buckets, utensils to fill up spilled edible oil after a tanker turned turtle on Farrukhabad- Bareilly state highway in Allahaganj area of Shahjahanpur district on Monday.

The tanker truck, carrying refined edible oil, was coming from Maharashtra and heading to Rudrapur in Uttarakhand. Police arrived at the spot nearly an hour late and dispersed the chaotic crowd with their oil-filled vessels. Such tankers usually have a capacity to carry around 30,000 litres of edible oil.

The accident occurred at 8 am when the tanker driver, identified as Rohit Kumar, driving slowly due to dense fog lost control of his vehicle after being hit by a speeding truck. The tanker soon turned turtle on the road after the collision. The other truck driver fled the scene leaving Kumar still stuck inside the driver’s cabin. On hearing a loud noise, a few locals arrived and rescued Kumar, who received some bruises on his hand. But, before Kumar could settle down, several villagers, including women and children, rushed towards the tanker and started filling the spilled oil into their empty vessels.

LK Mishra, a local, who was returning to Shahjahanpur from Rajasthan , informed police. But, the police arrived much later. Mishra told TOI, “The accident took place at 8 am near Gora and Sugsugi villages. The driver was alone in the tanker and couldn’t save the oil spill. The dial 112 team came for rescue after an hour while the local SHO didn’t even answer our repeated phone calls.”

An elderly person from a nearby village said, “The spilled over edible oil, though contaminated, can always be used along with fodder for cattle. I’ve heard that most of the villagers had grabbed pure oil directly from the tanker which can be used for cooking food.”

The tanker driver narrated, “I was on my way to Rudrapur to deliver refined edible oil when I met with an accident. After the accident, over 50 villagers arrived and started taking away the spilled oil in their vessels. I couldn’t do anything apart from informing the cops and the tanker owner. The villagers threatened to thrash me when I tried to stop some of them. Police arrived late. We have asked the police to file an FIR against the speeding truck driver and the villagers for the loot.”

Police, however, were yet to file an FIR till late in the evening. SHO Sudhakar Pandey said that he did not receive any written complaint from the truck driver.

Nagpur: The Nagpur Branch of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) organised a programme— CFO Meet — in the city recently. ICAI formed a committee for members of the industry and business to establish links between ICAI and chartered accountants who are employed in the industry.

The move aims to provide chartered accountants a base of reference in terms of knowledge, expertise, skills as well as give them assistance through establishing an intensive relationship with various stakeholders of the industry, said a press release issued by the Nagpur branch of ICAI.

“Chartered accountants in an industry or service sector are an integral part of the entity and they ensure optimum financial stability and security to various stakeholders,” said former ICAI president Jaydeep Shah. He was the chief guest during the function.

The confidence of the business promoters and the financial agencies, including creditors, is catered to by the chartered accountants, Shah said.

With the increasing burden of compliance under various types of laws, it is imperative for business houses to appoint chartered accountants. Banking is a sector which employs maximum number of chartered accountants to ensure financial scrutiny of proposals as well as ensure financial security of the lending agency, he said.

Referring to SC-appointed forensic auditors’ report that Amrapali Group indulged in “sham” agreements to divert money to the sports marketing & management company, the homebuyers had sought SC’s direction to the cricketer and the company to refund the money that would be used for construction of unfinished housing projects of the Group in which more than 45,000 buyers had put in money.

Opposing the plea, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Rhiti Sports, told a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and U U Lalit that the company was just managing endorsement rights of Dhoni and R Ashwin and it had already paid the money to the cricketers through cheque and asked how could it be directed to refund the money. The bench, thereafter, asked home-buyers’ lawyer M L Lahoty to file its response on application filed by the company.

Dhan Singh Rawat

DEHRADUN: Higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat on Monday said that the state government is mulling a ban on the use of mobile phones inside classrooms during classes in all colleges.

In order to facilitate this, the government will conduct a poll to ask students whether they feel that mobiles should be allowed in the classrooms or not, the minister said.

“If 51 per cent students vote for a mobile ban in classrooms, we will ban the use of phones,” he said, adding that parents as well as teachers in colleges keep on expressing their concerns over excessive use of mobile phones by students in classrooms, which is why they were going to conduct the survey.

“We are a democratic country that is undergoing IT revolution, so, there is no point in curtailing people’s freedom. But we aim to ensure that students remain focused at least during 40 minutes of their class. Mobiles do cause distractions. And this fact is undeniable,” Rawat told TOI.

The higher education minister further said, “We still feel that students will only decide whether they want to carry mobile to classrooms in colleges or not. Hence, our poll will be helpful to understand their points of view.”

Rawat also acknowledged the fact that preparations were needed to ensure that mobiles are kept safely in colleges. “We will have to provide lockers outside classes, if students want a mobile ban in classes. Or else, we will have to ask students to keep their phones switched off. Whatever it is, we will plan accordingly after taking the suggestions from students,” he added.

Welcoming the higher education minister’s announcement, Ajay Saksena, principal of DAV College in the city, said that mobiles used by students often cause distraction — not just for students, but teachers as well. “At times, even teachers get disturbed due to mobile calls and rings. I feel it will be a good move if mobiles are banned during classes,” he said.

When asked why students cannot be simply told to switch off or put their phones on silent modes in classrooms, Saksena said, “Government kept on saying that smoking in public places is unethical. But did it have the desired effect? Only when smoking in public places was banned, people started becoming more cautious.”

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: More than 20 people in the state, who are believed to be in constant touch with the culprits involved in the shooting of a police officer at Kaliyikkavila checkpost , are under the scanner of the police.

Even though the state police are not involved in the case as the deceased police officer belonged to the Tamil Nadu police, the state police are helping the Tamil Nadu police to track the culprits in the case. “On the basis of their phone records, more than 20 people are under the scanner of the police. Those who were picked by the Tamil Nadu police from Thenmala on Sunday are those who were in close contact with the culprits,” sources said.

Four people were taken into custody at Thenmala on Sunday, by Q branch of Tamil Nadu police with the help of the state police. Sources said that it is suspected that religious fundamentalists are behind the job and the probe has a nationwide scope. “The state police are only a part of the case. The probe is being conducted in Bengaluru and Delhi as well,” sources said. The police are closely liaising not only with Tamil Nadu police, but police from other states to where the probe has been extended. “This could either be a random act or an act that is in retaliation to some incident,” sources added.

Last Wednesday, special sub-inspector in Tamil Nadu police Y Wilson was shot dead at the Tamil Nadu side of the Kaliyikkavila checkpost.

The police received information that two youths — Thoufeeq and Abdul Shameem — who were radicalised are behind the act.

Representative image

PUNE: A married couple was found dead in their flat at Shastri chowk in Bhosari on Tuesday morning, in a case of suspected murder-suicide. A note recovered from the house indicated that the couple was under financial stress.

The man, Anil Deshmukh (32), was found hanging from the ceiling fan while his wife, Priyanka (27), was found dead nearby.

The couple has a seven-year-old daughter who had stayed the night with Priyanka’s friend and got to know her parents were no more only in the morning. The girl has been entrusted to the care of Priyanka’s brother. The police have registered a case under charges of murder and suicide.

“Based on a note recovered from the spot and preliminary post-mortem findings, we suspect that Deshmukh first strangled his wife to death and then hanged himself late on Monday night,” senior inspector Shankar Awatade of the Bhosari police told TOI.

Awatade said the note, purportedly written by Deshmukh, was addressed to his late mother. “I am sending your daughter-in-law to you; I am also coming,” the note read.

The note highlighted that Deshmukh and his wife were going through financially hard times, which also was the reason for the frequent quarrels between them, the police said. “Deshmukh was unemployed for the past two years, while Priyanka worked for an automobile showroom,” Awatade said.

The family had moved into the rented flat, located on Alandi Road, a few months ago. Deshmukh was from Indore and Priyanka from Amravati. Theirs was a love marriage. He had earlier worked with a private company in Chakan, police said.

Awatade said Priyanka would frequently let her daughter stay at her friend’s house. The girl was unwell on Monday night but still went to stay with her mother’s friend.

“Late in the night, neighbours heard the couple quarrelling over their financial situation. We suspect that in a fit of rage, Deshmukh throttled her before hanging himself,” Awatade said.

On Tuesday morning, Priyanka’s friend called her several times and, when she got no answer, came to the flat. “She knocked on the door several times and later alerted a neighbour, who called the police,” Awatade said.

The police broke open the door and found Priyanka lying motionless on the floor with Deshmukh hanging from the ceiling fan. “The couple was rushed to hospital where they were declared brought dead,” Awatade said.

Protesters at Unani hospital campus in the city on Monday

HYDERABAD: Medical students and doctors of Government Nizamia Unani Hospital, Charminar , staged protests on the college campus on Monday, in solidarity with students of Jamia Millia Islamia and declaring their anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) stance.

Nearly 200 doctors, holding placards, demanded immediate arrest of people who attacked students at Jamia. They also said their peaceful protest would continue till NRC and CAA are rolled back by the Centre.

Ibrahim Mohammed, a post-graduate student, said they would be sitting outside the library from 3pm to 9pm now on and even study in the open, as a mark of protest.

“We fear that if attacks had been carried out on students at Jamia and JNU, it can also happen on us one day. We may come under attack from goons and the way police is acting, there is hardly any reason to believe it will not spread to other colleges and universities. They don’t want the voice of the youth to come out and hence they are attacking students,” Syeda Husna Fatima, a fourth-year under-graduate (UG) student, said.

Zubair Alam, a UG final year student, meanwhile, said the medical fraternity has been attacked at JNU when the ambulance with doctors in it was vandalised. “This bill by the government is not only unconstitutional but also irrational. They are asking for documents from citizens and want to allow refugees from Pakistan , Afghanistan and Bangladesh without any documentation,” he said.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: District level committee reports to confirm whether a farmer committed suicide due to agricultural losses are being delayed in Telangana due to which the families of the farmers are failing to get ex gratia on time.

A Right to Information Act reply revealed a huge delay in the committee reports. While NCRB says farmers suicides increased in Telangana, the government machinery has been failing to act fast to clear the ex gratia for farmers.

Rythu Swarajya Vedika activist Kondal Reddy told TOI,” We can understand if the three-member committee report is delayed by a few months, but in several cases, the report is pending for the past five years. In Warangal Urban district three cases of farmer suicides are pending for verification by a three-member committee.”

The RTI reply revealed that D Chandra Rao of Devenur in Dharamasagar mandal of Warangal Urban committed suicide on October 9, 2015, but the status is ‘Three-member committee report under process’. Similar cases include those of Sandaraju Sudhakar of Nagaram in Hasanparthy mandal and Mittapally Raju of Elukurthy of Dharmasagar mandal who ended their life in October 2015.

Another anomaly is that Yadadri Bhongir district officials are delaying payment of Rs 1 crore ex gratia to 18 families although the entire process is done.

“For the past three to four years, Yadadri district is not handing over the ex gratia amount. How can a district have Rs 1 crore? Each family was granted Rs 6 lakh,” said Kondal Reddy.

Families of farmers are also facing similar issues in Andhra Pradesh. “In Kurnool, only 14 farmers were given ex gratia after YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s government came into power . However, after the government came into power, around 62 farmers ended life till October 7. When will the government do justice to other farmers?” questioned Kondal Reddy.

bizarre turn of events

Gorakhpur: An elephant, owned by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Gorakhpur (rural) Vipin Singh, trampled its mahout to death in Singhpur village, under Jangha police station, on Monday. Police said the tusker and the mahout, Shabbir (34), were returning from a hawan in Deoria.

The body has been sent for an autopsy.

Police lodged a complaint submitted by Shabbir’s family members. Station house officer of Jangha police station Anil Kumar Singh said, “BJP MLA Vipin Singh has said that he would help the mahout’s family in every possible way.”

The elephant, Ganga Ram, was trained and was looked after by cousin duo Shabbir and Asim. On Monday while returning from Deoria, the two mahouts stopped at Singhpur village to rest. When Asim went to attend nature’s call, Shabbir stood on the elephant’s back to pluck leaves from a Peepal tree to feed Ganga Ram. However, as soon as Shabbir sat down, the elephant held him with his trunk and threw him down with force. He then trampled him to death.

HYDERABAD: A car driver was arrested for allegedly misbehaving with an airlines employee at Shamshabad on Saturday morning. The incident happened when the victim was en route to work.

According to police, the victim , a 21-year-old woman from Shamshahad, works at the Rajiv Gandhi International (RGI) Airport.

Around 7.25am, the victim left her house and reached Shamshabad bus station to get into a vehicle to reach the airport. “She stood near Sangeeta mobile showroom looking for transport to report her workplace. Meanwhile, a taxi driver stopped his vehicle near her and started calling passengers intending to go to the airport to get in,” RGI Airport inspector P Vijay Kumar said.

The victim was the only passenger, who boarded the car. “After starting the car, the driver asked for Rs 150 to drop her at the airport. However, the victim said she will give Rs 120 and the accused insisted that she should pay the full amount. The victim then offered to give a chocolate for the balance amount. The car driver then mistook what she said and misbehaved by touching her. The victim then asked the driver to stop the car and raised an alarm. With other people on the road noticing him, the accused stopped the car at Pulla Reddy Sweets on the airport approach road and forced the victim to disembark from his vehicle. He fled from the spot,” the inspector said.

Based on a complaint of the victim, police analysed CCTV camera footage and arrested the car driver, Mohammed Samyuddin, on Sunday.

106,['14/01/2020'],ED to attach assets of J P Morgan,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Enforcement Directorate

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Enforcement Directorate to proceed against Mauritius-based firm JP Morgan and attach its properties for taking away Rs 140 crore of Amrapali homebuyers ’ money through alleged shady transactions in violation of FEMA and the Companies Act.

A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and U U Lalit directed the agency to take action against the firm to recover the amount without waiting for its order and bring the probe against the company to a logical conclusion. The apex court had ordered ED probe against J P Morgan after holding that the Rs 85 crore investment by the firm in Amrapali Group through FDI and taking away Rs 140 crore by selling its shares to shell companies at inflated value was a ploy to divert homebuyers’ money overseas.

The apex court accepted the findings of SC-appointed forensic auditors who concluded that the investment made by J P Morgan was in violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and Companies Act in connivance with Amrapali Group. The report had said that the firm had sold its shares worth of Rs 140 crore to two companies—Rudraksh and Neelkanth— whose directors at that time were peons of the Amrapali Group.

A senior ED official said the agency will soon initiate proceedings under PMLA against both Amrapali and JP Morgan and the latter’s assets equivalent to Rs 140 crore can be attached in India. The ED need not file a separate case against JP Morgan as its PMLA case against Amrapali, where JP Morgan is an accused, is sufficient to attach the company’s assets.

J P Morgan had refuted the allegation of violation of any law in investing in Amrapali Group and later on selling its stake. But the bench had rejected its plea and held that FEMA rules prohibited transactions route adopted by the company to invest in Amrapali. “We are in agreement with the findings of the forensic auditors in this regard,” it had said.

Kochi: Women travellers looking for safe stay in Kerala would soon be able to book hostel rooms using an Oyo-like app being developed by the Kerala State Womens’ Development Corporation ( KSWDC ).

The corporation is also working towards developing a set of standards for women hostels in the state to provide better user experience.

KSWDC has already identified 160 hostels in the state —both public and private— which they intent to partner with, as part of the Stay Safe project. “The idea is to bring all the hostels under one app to provide safe night-stay to women who travel,” said Bindu V C, managing director, KSWDC.

The aggregator platform would give more visibility to the hostels and also enable easy booking as women won’t have to physically scout around for vacant hostel rooms. KSWDC has invited expression of interest from startups registered under Kerala Startup Mission for developing the app which will have the ability to identify nearby hostels from the current user location. The app would list out available hostel rooms and facilities based on date and location. Users would also have the ability to rate previous bookings they have made.

KSWDC officals said though they have shortlisted 160 hostels only 60 of them have provided them the details. “An initial meeting was attended by representatives of 30 hostels. Once we identify all the hostels we will set standards for the rooms on offer and then enter into an agreement with them,” said a KSWDC official.

The corporation wants all partner hostels to have facilities comparable to hotel rooms including attached bathrooms, towels, napkins and toiletry articles like soap. KSWDC has not looked into restrictions imposed by hostels on inmates. “The whole point is to make the experience safe for women who travel at night. So such restrictions won’t work,” the official said.

For government facilities there would be a centralised tariff system while for private hostel rooms the rate shall be defined with a cap as set by KSWDC. The plan is to pilot the project using a dedicated helpline number before shifting aggregation and boooking to the app, sources said.

Lallu was here to attend the meeting of Congress office-bearers and workers on Monday. Talking to reporters, he accused Mayawati of dancing to BJP’s tune because of the fear of CBI and ED. By distancing herself from the opposition meeting for protecting the Constitution, she showed that she is going against the dream of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, he said adding that it is a clear indication that she is working hand in glove with the BJP.

Thiruvananthapuram: The Janata Dal (Secular) state unit will resume negotiations with the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) regarding their proposed merger after January 17. The decision was taken at the JD(S) state committee meeting held here on Monday.

The meeting witnessed heated debates over the issue with a section of leaders raising doubts over lack of transparency in the process. According to sources, Thiruvananthapuram district committee chief Firoz Lal and Kannur district president PP Divakaran demanded transparency by taking into confidence district president and state committee members regarding the merger talks. Divakaran said all those who had taken the lead to form JD(S) when the party was split should be included in the talks. It was decided that the final decision would be taken only with the concurrence of the state committee.

State president CK Nanu told the leadership panel that a committee comprising minister K Krishnankutty, Mathew T Thomas MLA, A Neelalohitadas and him is leading the talks. He said MP Veerendra Kumar and MV Sreyams Kumar of LJD had already held discussions with JD(S) national president HD Deve Gowda. Krishnankutty told the committee that Gowda entrusted the panel to negotiate with LJD leadership when he met them at Kottakkal on December 24.

Sources said a few leaders also raised questions over the demand by LJD for eight district president posts. Leaders including Thomas said discussions should be transparent and JD (S) should demand more positions during merger.

The national leadership of JD(S) has asked state leadership to reach a consensus within the party and reach an agreement with LJD before submitting the merger formula to them. Efforts are on to complete the procedure at the earliest as the state would soon switch to panchayat election mode.

CHENNAI: Ordering food online may be a matter of a few taps for the customer, but delivering the parcel is anything but a smooth 30-minute bike ride for the assigned executive. He may be speeding, jumping signals or hurtling down the wrong lane to hand you over a packet before getting ready for more orders.More than 22,000 cases have been booked against online food delivery executives in the past six months for violating traffic rules. Cases include riding on the wrong side, taking unauthorised U-turns, speeding, using mobile phones while riding and not wearing helmets.The Chennai traffic police say they have intensified checks and organised special drives to rein in offenders. Sources said police keep meeting delivery staff and representatives from Swiggy, Zomato, Uber Eats, Food Panda and other online food aggregators every two months. And while compliance may go up after such efforts, violations are too common.Additional commissioner of police, traffic, A Arun said food delivery executives were “hardworking people” . “But we book cases as we are concerned about their lives,” he replied when asked about violations.Last December, Satta Panchayat Iyakkam (SPI), a Chennai-based NGO, did an independent study in the city to ascertain the reason behind rampant violations. Teams were stationed on Old Mahabalipuram Road, Kamarajar Road, Anna Salai and Jawaharlal Nehru Road (Alandur-Koyambedu), and in Velachery and Thiruvanmiyur. A total of 375 executives were observed of whom nearly 65% committed at least one traffic offence.In a similar survey in 2018, riding without a helmet was the most common violation. But compliance was better in 2019, said the study. This can be primarily attributed to strict enforcement by police following the Madras high court ’s direction on the use of helmets.Riding down the wrong side or ignoring no-entry signs were among the most common offences in the 2019 study. This was attributed to the tight deadline for delivery executives, challenging incentive-based wage system and their unfamiliarly with routes.“We have to finish 25 to 30 deliveries a day to earn an incentive of Rs 14,000 per month. This means we have to work for at least 14 to 15 hours a day. We hardly get any breathing space between two consecutive orders,” said Sadish, a Swiggy delivery partner.Ratings from play a crucial role. For instance, a delivery staff with 4.8 or 4.9 rating out of 5 gets more bookings. “Even if we are late by two minutes, customers get annoyed and give us poor ratings. We are forced to rush. Sometimes, even if it is the hotel’s fault, we face the consequences,” Sadish said.Renga Prasad from SPI, who led the study, said, “Instead of penalising them, companies can adopt simple steps like printing grievance numbers on bikes, providing incentives for safe driving and adding road safety modules as a part of induction programmes.”While Swiggy refused to comment, Zomato said its staff are available to “segregate joinees (based on their behaviour and psychology), train them on safety measures and ensure that they wear their t-shirts and helmets while working.” As far as delivery time is concerned, there is no fixed deadline as estimated time of arrival changes with traffic conditions.A senior official from the state labour department said home delivery has emerged as a “huge industry” and efforts will be made to regulate it.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73245282,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-618877,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/traffic-rules-not-on-the-menu-of-citys-food-delivery-agents/articleshow/73235472.cms

For boosting the agriculture sector in the hills, he stressed on cluster-based farming, value addition and certification of organic products.

While addressing an event organised by NABARD on Monday, Rawat said that culture-based farming and organic farming were important to double farmers’ income.

We are making efforts to rejuvenate rivers and developing lakes in Pithoragarh, Champawat, Almora, Pauri, Chamoli, Dehradun and other districts and it will help in the long run,” said the CM.

NABARD has assessed the credit potential of Rs 24,656 crore for the overall development of Uttarakhand for the year 2020-21. Of this, there is an agricultural credit potential of Rs 11,802 crore.

Rawat added that to provide assistance to the agri sector, the state government was giving an interest-free loan up to Rs 1 lakh for the farmers.

The RTU entrance in Kota

KOTA: The non-availability of teaching staff in Rajasthan Technical University ( RTU ) has raised a question mark on the seriousness of the consecutive governments in imparting technical education.

Fifty five percent posts, both teaching as well as non-teaching, are lying vacant in the university. As per figures, RTU has a strength of 283 teaching and non-teaching staff against the sanctioned posts of 643. It has overburdened several departments which are neither teaching properly nor carrying out any research project.

Reports said that university had been inviting applications for recruitment since 2011 but withholding the process repeatedly. The only exception was 2014 when 60 candidates were recruited.

Ironically, the university has generated revenue of Rs 1.05 crore from 36,230 candidates who applied for various posts with examination fee for recruitment between 2011 and 2018.

The information sought through Right to Information (RTI) by Kota-based activist Sujeet Swami revealed that 63% posts of teaching staff in the university is lying vacant.

All 25 posts in the Petrochemical, Information Technology and MBA courses are lying vacant

Against 37 sanctioned posts of professors, only 10 posts are filled, while 27 are vacant. Similarly, only 19 associate professors are working against the sanctioned posts of 68. There are 67 assistant professors against the sanctioned posts of 156.

The picture of non-teaching staff is also dismal as 195 are vacant against 382 sanctioned posts, with occupancy on only 187 posts, including the significant posts of examination controller, director, dean, student welfare and accountant.

The RTI information also revealed the university had invited applications for filling various sanctioned posts in 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2018. However, it held back the recruitment process after charging examination fees from the applicants.

KOTA: The prelims of Kota Carnival (KOCA), which was conceptualised by Kota district collector Om Kesera to offer coaching students with opportunities to exhibit their talents in extra curriculur activities, was held at Rangmanch in Deshurra Maidan on Sunday.

The two-day event would kick-off on February 1 with around 2 lakh coaching students expected to participate.

The theme has been designed with a view to provide a stress-free environment to coaching students in addition to giving them an opportunity to exhibit their talent in extra curriculur activities, Kesera said.

Preparations for the event are underway on a war-footing.

In the prelims on Sunday evening, over 5000 coaching students participated and enthralled the audience with performances such as reciting poems on social evils, gallantry of soldiers while others played the guitar and piano .

The second round of the prelims will be held on January 19.

Notably, the district administration has initiated several measures to release study stress and provide healthy and amusing environment to coaching students in Kota after the city witnessed a spate of suicides in 2015.

121,['14/01/2020'],"Open garbage, dirty water: Khurbura residents cry for govt’s attention","This story is from January 14, 2020

Dehradun: Even as efforts are being made to make Dehradun a smart city, some areas continue to remain in miserable condition. The Khurbura area, one of the oldest localities in the city is one such location.

There is no door-to-door garbage collection facility in the area and locals do not have access to clean piped water. A spot visit by TOI revealed that loose and naked wires have become a threat for residents and hardly any development work reaches the area, which is cut off by Bindal river. Also, children working as labourers can easily be spotted here. “There isn’t any proper bridge for us to go to the other side to use public services. The temporary bridge breaks whenever it rains, and we get cut off from the rest of the city. Last year, a woman had to deliver her child without doctor’s assistance,” said Rajkumar Sahni, a local resident. He added that stench from garbage, lying in the open,has made many residents ill.

Locals also lament the fact that the state government does not give them attention as they are a migrant colony. Pooja Devi, who migrated to the city from Bihar around 20 years ago, told TOI, “We came here from Bihar for better job opportunities and better lifestyle. But moving here didn’t change things. Even after so many years, we are treated like outsiders here. Development of our locality isn’t a priority of any government.” She added that names of her family members are in the voter rolls but besides voting, they don’t get any government benefits.

Residents of Khurbura locality say that officials don’t take any concrete steps to address their woes despite several complaints. “There is no night shelter for the homeless, no medical facility for us. Those in power only make tall promises during elections,” said Abhishek, another local.

When asked to comment, Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) officials claimed that all civic amenities are being provided in the locality. “Garbage was cleared from the locality a few days ago but it has got accumulated again. Soon, our garbage collection van would pick it up,” said Kailash Joshi, chief health officer of DMC.

Meanwhile, Khurbura ward councilor Vimla Gaur told TOI, “I tabled the proposal for construction of a proper bridge at DMC board meeting. The bridge will get installed very soon. As far as cleaning of Bindal river is concerned, the administration has assured me that they will take steps regarding that very soon.”

122,['14/01/2020'],BJP’s internal conflicts hitting governance: Khader,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Mangaluru: Former minister and Mangaluru MLA U T Khader lashed out at the government for not convening the winter sessions of legislative assembly and legislative council, which are usually held in November or December.

While speaking to reporters here on Monday, the Congress leader also questioned the BJP government for not holding a joint session of the legislatures, which is customarily addressed by the governor in the first or second week of January every year.

“The whole administrative machinery is non-functional due to the internal conflicts of BJP. The party is busy with cabinet expansion and portfolio allocation to MLAs. People of the state are being forced to grin and bear it,” Khader said, and urged the government to hold the sessions immediately.

Taking chief minister B S Yediyurappa to task, Khader said the government has no confidence about its stability owing to internal issues. “Compensation has not been paid to those who have lost their property in the recent calamity. Beneficiaries of various housing schemes have not been given funds to complete the construction works. Those who have worked under National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme have not been paid for their job, and so is the plight of ASHAs and other health workers. Don’t weaken the democratic set-up of the state by neglecting people,” Khader urged.

‘Clear air on survey’

Khader said he has directed DC Sindhu B Rupesh to issue a clarification with regard to recent instances wherein people refused to provide information during a door-to-door survey by ASHAs, health workers, anganwadi workers and election officials.

“People are apprehensive about the implementation of Citizens’ Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). An atmosphere of fear has gripped villagers with regard to CAA and NRC. Hence, I have asked the DC to issue a clarification stating that no data collection on CAA and NRC is being done in the district. I also appeal to people to cooperate with health workers and officials by giving them the required information being collected for government schemes and election purposes. The government should also should make it clear whether they have commenced any process related to CAA and NRC,” Khader said.

‘BJP is narrow-minded’

Calling the protest against the proposal to construct a 114-foot tall statue of Jesus Christ at Kapalabetta in Kanakapura shows the “narrow-mindedness of the party”, Khader said BJP should remember the contributions of Catholic institutions in India.

Thiruvananthapuram: After an intense face-off, the National Highway Authority of India backed down to allow the Kerala Water Authority’s sewerage division to dig up the newly widened portion at Enchakkal Junction to restore a manhole which got buried under the asphalt. KWA initiated the work on Saturday.

On the first day itself, KWA was able to clear the blockage in the manhole which had led to overflowing sewage lines in Vallakkadavu and nearby areas. “After identifying the manhole, we were able to clear the block after opening it. The issue of overflowing of sewage has been resolved. This has been troubling local residents for a while,” said a KWA official.

The State Human Rights Commission had intervened after areas such as Vallakkadavu, Karali and Enchakkal were affected. The work was delayed after NHAI asked KWA to adopt trenchless technology instead of digging up the recently paved road, which the latter rejected.

Meanwhile, traffic congestion at Enchakkal Junction, which was leading to snarls on the national highway, is likely to intensify due to the work. KWA has barricaded the middle of the junction for the work and sources said police are not planning any traffic diversions.

KWA officials said the entire work would take around two weeks to complete. “We have resolved the issue of the block. Now, we have to replace the brick manhole with a concrete one for better stability,” officials said.

In order to prevent digging in future, NHAI had suggested that KWA construct manholes of both sides of the national highway and connect them through horizontal drilling. However, KWA ignored the request citing shortage of funds

Enchakkal is only one of many traffic choke points on the national highway. The junction has direct access to two main roads – one from Vallakkadavu and one from East Fort.

NHAI allowed KWA to dig up the junction on the condition that the portion will be restored as per its standards. “Several road safety issues are caused due to the negligence of agencies like the KWA in properly restoring dug up portions on national highways. So strict guidelines have been issued for such work,” said NHAI sources, who also voiced concern over traffic congestion at Enchakkal.

127,['14/01/2020'],"On duty, transport officer crushed by truck","This story is from January 14, 2020

Mohammad Tareef

NEW DELHI: A transport department officer was mowed down by a speeding truck just a week before his daughter’s wedding. The officer had signalled the truck to stop for checking on Mathura Road in south Delhi around 5.30am on Sunday. The truck was going from Ashram towards Badarpur.

The deceased, Gagan Sigroha (43), was the sole breadwinner of his family. His daughter’s wedding was scheduled on January 19. His family alleged that no one from the transport department spoke to them in their time of grief.

Transport department sub-inspector Radhe Shyam, in his statement to police, said that he and four constables, including Sigroha, were on checking duty from 4am to noon on Sunday. Sigroha was to go on leave for his daughter’s wedding after his shift ended.

“We had parked our car on the roadside near Mohan Estate and were checking vehicles moving from Ashram towards Badarpur. Constables Sigroha and Jagbeer tried to stop a truck bearing a Rajasthan numberplate. Instead of stopping, the driver started speeding and ran over Sigroha in his attempt to flee. Sigroha was rushed to a hospital where he was declared brought dead,” Shyam said.

Later, the transport department officers managed to stop the truck and take the driver, Mohammad Tareef, a resident of Nuh in Haryana, in custody.

Sigroha is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter. He was a native of Ritauli village in Rohtak. He had taken early retirement from Indian Army and joined the transport department around six years ago.

Pankaj Sejwal, Sigroha’s brother-in law, said, “He was jolly man and had never hurt anyone. His daughter’s wedding was fixed two months ago, but the celebrations have been put on hold now that he is no more. We will try and carry out the mourning soon so that the wedding can take place. The invitation cards have already been distributed so we cannot cancel it at the last moment.”

Sejwal alleged that no one from the transport department visited or spoke to the family after the incident. “He died on duty . Something should be done for the safety of the people who are serving the department. Either there should be barricades or they could carry out checking along with police,” he suggested.

Recalling an old conversation with Gagan, Sejwal said, “I would often ask him how he could do such a risky job. He would reply, safe hoke rehta hoon main (I try to be safe). His words seem to be still ringing in my ears.”

Meanwhile, special commissioner (transport) KK Dahiya said, “We have a standard operating procedure in place for the safety of our personnel and they are trained in it. There are strict directions that checking of vehicles should only be carried out in well-lit areas as our personnel mostly perform their task at night. The rules also dictate that they should not conduct checking at intersections where vehicles can speed.”

Dahiya said there are 60 teams of the transport department’s enforcement wing that check and prosecute vehicles violating norms every day. Such incidents are rare as all personnel know the rules very well. He added that this accident was unusual and the police probe is expected to unravel more details.

The department on Monday prepared a proposal to grant ex-gratia compensation for Sigroha’s family. “The proposal will be sent to the government by Tuesday,” Dahiya said, adding that the department will try to provide the maximum compensation possible to Sigroha’s family.

“Our personnel are deployed day and night in arduous work. Despite the huge volume of work, we deliver results. Our personnel are very hardworking and diligent and they mark their presence despite the skeletal staff and have created fear among violators,” Dahiya said.

128,['14/01/2020'],‘Plan to stop water from going to Pak in final leg’,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Jaisalmer: The plan to stop water from going to Pakistan has reached its final stage, Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said on Monday during his visit to Pokhran’s locust-hit areas.

Many physical technical study reports have come and many reports are yet to come. Consent has been received from the Jammu and Kashmir government. In the coming days, we will certainly create history and succeed in stopping water from going to Pakistan, said Shekhawat.

Under the Indus Waters Treaty signed between India and Pakistan in 1960, all the waters of three rivers, namely Ravi, Sutlej and Beas (eastern rivers) averaging around 33 million acre feet (MAF) were allocated to India for exclusive use, while Chenab, Jhelum and Sindhu waters were allotted to Pakistan.

Even today, India’s share of drinking and irrigation water is going to Pakistan and we do not have arrangements to stop it. After Modi government came to power, efforts to contain this water were started.

In regard to Namami Ganga project, he said, under the directions of PM Modi, cleaning of Ganga started and today 42% of its water has become a lifeline for the people. Apart from drinking, the water is being used for irrigation. So far, 2,600km river has been cleaned. From Gangotri to Rishikesh, the river has been made potable. Today, Ganga is included in one of the top ten clean rivers in the world, which is a matter of pride. The work is still on. Many plans have been made to stop the polluted water from being discharged in Ganga. The work can be completed only when the general public joins the movement.

Replying to Rajasthan cabinet minister Saleh Mohammmad’s allegation of breach of promise of providing rail connectivity to Pokhran, Shekhawat said he would like to ask Rahul Gandhi, Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot about the loan waiver promise made to farmers before the elections. He said that Congress’ promise was to waive 100% loan but even today 60 lakh farmers are waiting for loan waiver. The previous Vasundhara Raje government had waived 3,000 crore loans and Gehlot government gave certificates of the same.

Shekhawat said that Congress’ promise of unemployment allowance of Rs 3,500, scholarship to graduate youths is still unfulfilled. Besides, an additional load of 90-95 paise per unit of electricity is weighing down the farmers. He said that farmers are crying that their crops have been damaged by locusts and Pokhran MLA should be ashamed that instead of comforting the farmers he is playing politics.

He said Congress has always misguided the people and never fulfilled their announcements. But, whatever promises BJP had made it has fulfilled. He said that in JNU students are shouting slogans to divide India and Congress is standing with them.

Mangaluru: JD(S) Dakshina Kannada district committee president Mohammed Kunhi Vitla demanded an investigation into the video clippings of the Mangaluru violence released by former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy.

He told reporters here on Monday the evidence should be verified scientifically. He alleged the government is trying to derail the probe by making Mangaluru city police commissioner to issue statements against Kumaraswamy.

“The evidence released by Kumaraswamy contains 100% truth. Let the government, which claims it’s fake, conduct an impartial inquiry,” Mohammed Kunhi said.

He asked why an investigation into Kumaraswamy’s revelations was not ordered when all departments and officials are under the BJP government. “How can the government declare the evidence as fake even before an inquiry? Let the government take action if investigation proves it’s fake,” he said.

On Mangaluru city police commissioner PS Harsha’s video in which he indirectly countered Kumaraswamy’s claims of police atrocities, Mohammed Kunhi said the government is trying to change the direction of investigation with police help. “Why is the government, which blames opposition parties for Mangaluru violence, not ready to order a judicial inquiry?” he asked.

He added that none of the MLAs in the district were able to use funds for local area development after BJP formed the government in the state. “No new government schemes are being announced for the district. MLAs and MLCs are forced to beg for funds for local area development,” he said.

He added: “Police officials directed us to get permission for a press conference. We submitted an application at the Mangaluru North police station. However, we haven’t been allowed to hold it. Permission was granted only after we spoke to the city police commissioner,” he said.

Lucknow: A young man from Lucknow studying in the US missed his connecting flight from Dubai early on Sunday owing to rainfall-triggered heavy waterlogging at Al Maktoum International Airport, which had a cascading effect on the departure schedules at Amausi airport.

The student was not the only one stranded because of inclement weather in Dubai. Scores of passengers from Lucknow bound for the UAE city had a harrowing experience owing to delays and diversions involving three flights on Saturday and Sunday.

“The first flight affected was Air India Express, which was scheduled for departure at 2.15pm on Saturday. It was delayed by two hours following rain and flooding alert at Al Maktoum, where only one runway was open for landing. The congestion delayed my brother’s flight from Amausi to Dubai by an hour. As a result, he missed his connecting flight to the US,” said Ankit, the young man’s brother.

According to airport officials, the second flight to Dubai was of a private airline on Saturday evening. It departed from Amausi on time, but as it reached Dubai, the pilot was asked to divert and land at Sharjah airport instead. This lead to a delay of around two hours.

“The third flight was of Fly Dubai, which departed on time at 1.35am on Sunday. As it reached Al Maktoum around 4.30am, the pilot was told to divert towards another international airport in Dubai. The diversion caused delay in landing. However, flight operations are now returning to normal,” said a Fly Dubai spokesperson.

The airline also issued an advisory through its social media account, informing passengers on Sunday morning about the inclement weather in Dubai and its impact on flights.

Arsalan Ahmad, brother of city resident Mohammad who was on a Fly Dubai flight, told TOI that the latter was stuck on board and at the airport for hours. “Later, he called me and narrated the ordeal of passengers because of the diversions. Some had panic attack while others were severly agitated over the delay,” Ahmad said.

Several passengers who were scheduled to return to Lucknow were also stranded at Al Maktoum for hours, as their flights were equally delayed. Spokesperson for Airports Authority of India Sanjay K. Narayan on Sunday said flight operations were now back to normal.

Announcing the decision, vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar said on Monday, “The administration will explore the possibility of moving court for the registration of an FIR. We have already exhausted all other options, having given a written complaint to SHO, Jamia Nagar, with a copy to the police chief and DCP (south east). Letters have also been sent to joint CP (southern range) and DCP (crime) for registration of an FIR earlier.”

The decision to cancel the exams was taken after students gheraoed her office and raised slogans. Akhtar emerged from her office and took questions. The students not only demanded that the semester exams, which started after the winter break, be cancelled, but also action be taken against Delhi Police for entering the campus allegedly without permission and attacking the students during a protest against CAA and NRC.

Later, the university issued a separate statement. “On the demand of the protesting students, the vice-chancellor, in consultation with the deans, HoDs and other officials, has announced that the ongoing semester exams stand cancelled till further notice. A new schedule will be declared later,” it stated. This is for the second time that the university exams have been postponed. On Tuesday, a meeting of the executive council has been called to discuss these issues.

In the interaction with the VC, a student asked what action the university planned to take against Delhi Police for holding students liable for the violence. Reiterating that the police had entered the university without permission, Akhtar said: “Police is registering unnamed FIRs against the protesting students.” She said she had even written a letter to the Centre in this regard.

A team of National Human Rights Commission will visit the campus on Tuesday to speak to the injured students and eyewitnesses. “The university has already handed over all evidence to NHRC. I am hopeful that they will understand our point of view,” Akhtar said.

Responding to a question on whether she planned to go ahead with a scheduled leave on January 15, Akhtar said: “I am not going anywhere. I am with you.”

The students have also given a call for a protest termed “Jamia Chalo” on Wednesday, marking a month of the incident on the campus.

136,['14/01/2020'],Delhi high court to hear petition against closure of Shaheen Bagh road,"This story is from January 14, 2020

File photo used for representational purpose

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Monday agreed to examine a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), which sought its intervention to open Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch of the capital.

The road is closed since December 15 due to ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The plea was mentioned before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar which listed it for hearing on Tuesday. It argued that the road closure was causing huge inconvenience/hardship to lakhs of commuters everyday and they were compelled to take different routes for the last one month.

Filed by advocate Amit Sahni, the plea seeks direction to the Delhi police commissioner to re-open for traffic Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch and Okhla underpass, pointing out that such blockages are meant only as a temporary measure. The Kalindi Kunj stretch is a crucial link that connects Delhi, Faridabad (Haryana) and Noida (Uttar Pradesh). Commuters who use these roads are forced to take alternative routes—Delhi-Noida-Delhi (DND) Expressway and Ashram, which is causing hours of traffic jams and wastage of time and fuel, the plea said.

“Re-opening of schools has forced children, who take that route, to leave home two hours prior to school timing but authorities have failed to take appropriate action to give relief to the residents of the locality and lakhs of commuters of Delhi, UP and Haryana, despite representations.”

Due to the heavy traffic on alternative routes, it takes 15-20 minutes for people to cross just one traffic signal at Ashram, it said, citing news reports about the additional vehicle load on Ashram Chowk. With the Kalindi Kunj road closure, an additional 1 lakh vehicles are flowing through the intersection.

The high court, on January 10, had refused to entertain another similar plea seeking directions for removal of protesters from the Shaheen Bagh road .

In December, 2019, over a plea seeking to remove physically challenged protesters from the periphery of Mandi House, the court had directed that the petition be treated as representation by the authorities and to be decided in accordance with law, keeping in mind the permissions given by the police to the protesters, effect on the traffic and inconvenience caused to the public at large.

the big question

Allahabad: With officiating vice-chancellor of Allahabad University (AU) KS Mishra retiring on January 14, all eyes are on Ministry of human resources development ( MHRD ) to appoint a new candidate to head the institution which has been reeling under a slew of controversies.

Mishra, as the senior-most professor on AU campus, is performing his duties as the officiating VC, but he would be retiring on Tuesday (January 14). AU registrar has sent a list of senior professors so that the ministry could decided on a name for the next VC.

Former AU VC R L Hangloo submitted his resignation to the MHRD on January 1 and his resignation as accepted by the President, who is the chancellor of AU, on January 3.

The President also ordered an inquiry into several administrative decisons taken by Hangloo during his tenure, from December 30, 2015 to December 31, 2019. A three-member committee was also constituted for the purpose and the panel would be headed by the University Grants Commission chairman DP Singh. Sources said that according to the list sent to the Center, SA Ansari from commerce faculty is the senior-most professor on the campus, followed by RK Tewari of JK Institute.

However, the fact that Ansari had faced an inquiry into his administrative decisions in the past has university officials sceptic about the latter’s chances. “We have sent a list of AU’s senior professors to the MHRD and are waiting for their orders, after which a new officiating VC would be appointed,” said AU registrar NK Shukla.

“AU would soon be publishing an advertisement calling applications for the post of AU VC,” he added.

The three-member committee would be visiting the AU campus this week itself. There is a possibility that the MHRD might clear the name of the new officiating VC on Tuesday itself as January 15 is a holiday.

Puducherry: Congress MLA N Danavelu , who called on lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi on Monday evening at Raj Nivas, accused chief minister V Narayanasamy and his son of indulging in ‘corrupt activities in land deals’ in the Union territory.

Danavelu promised to produce evidence on the alleged corrupt practices of the CM and his son to Bedi after the Pongal holidays.

Bedi in a press note later said, “He (Danavelu) was saying that he will like to produce evidence of blatant corruption in land deals being committed by HCM (honourable chief minister) along with his son. I told him he can approach the CBI office in Puducherry directly also for investigations. He said he would revisit me after Pongal and show me the evidence to be forwarded to CBI.”

Danavelu, while briefing the media on Saturday, came down heavily on the Congress government in the UT, and accused Narayanasamy and health minister Malladi Krishna Rao of corrupt practices. He had vowed that he would soon submit a list of their corrupt practices to the party high command. He claimed the local Congress unit has begun targeting him for attempting to expose the corrupt practices of the government. He alleged that corruption has been ruling the roost in almost all departments of the government and specifically targeted the health directorate claiming it failed to ensure adequate stock of life-saving medicines in government hospitals and centres.

The Congress MLA had on Thursday staged a protest picketing the Bahour primary health centre charging that the centre has not been equipped with adequate life-saving drugs and necessary infrastructure and drivers to operate ambulances.

However, Narayanasamy and Rao, while speaking to the media on Friday, refuted his charges.

As there was lack space for classrooms and other facilities at the place, the corporation carried out construction work at a cost of Rs 63 lakh. The school was shifted to the new campus on January 4.

“We have been given the same number of classrooms we had on the old campus. But the buildings for two anganwadis, which were also functioning along with the school, and noon-meal kitchen need to be provided, besides water facility,” said an official from the school education department.

Bijnor: With villagers killing three leopards in western Uttar Pradesh over the last seven days, state government is taking a fresh look at the causes of man-animal conflict. In Bijnor, where a leopard was gunned down on January 6, encroachment on government forest land is being seen as a key reason behind big cats taking refuge amid cane and wheat fields. Bijnor revenue department has formed three teams to remove the encroachers who have sown wheat in the corridor linking Hastinapur Sanctuary with the forests in Uttarakhand.

Another leopard was shot dead on January 8 in Moradabad and the third on January 12 in Budaun.

Officials here said illegal farming on government land has resulted in destroying natural habitats of wildlife, pushing them into inhabited areas of man. They said around 50,000 bigha of government land on the bed and banks of the Ganga in the areas bordering Bijnor, Meerut and Muzaffarnagar has been grabbed by land sharks and villagers in collusion with irrigation and forest staff. They use the land for cultivating sugarcane and wheat crops.

According to SDM, Bijnor, Brijesh Kumar Singh, “Land of Khaddar area belongs to the irrigation, forest and revenue departments. Some persons have sown wheat on that land. We have formed three teams to keep a vigil on the Khaddar area and evict encroachers from government land. Some people have claimed ownership of the land and shown some papers to the effect but these documents are questionable.”

Singh said the revenue department has a list of more than 40 people who will soon be served notices for land grab.

Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran said forest staff has been asked to gather details about land encroachments in Rawali and Ganj areas of Bijnor range. They are a part of Hastinapur Sanctuary, a protected zone, covering 2,073 km square area spanning Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Ghaziabad, Bijnor and Amroha districts.The area stretches up to Balawali, almost touching Uttarakhand,

According to Sanjeev Rana, a resident of Madhusudanpur village, “Some influential people have grabbed government land in Rawali area and sown wheat crop. Besides, they have rented out some encroached land to vegetable growers. Both forest and irrigation staff are hand in glove with them. They beat drums and burst fire crackers to shoo away wild animals from the land.”

Alwal lies in a very confusing part of GHMC and SCB. First, the area must be clearly demarcated by both bodies. The passing of buck for upkeep of the area and provision of basic civic facilities has to be stopped between both players. The most important issue is encroachment which cannot be missed by even a layman who would visit Alwal for the first time. The footpath/open space near Satya complex has been occupied by hawkers who have made it a permanent place for business. Ramps in front of shops are completely encroached upon by shopkeepers. The gradual rise in encroachments has made matters worse in small lanes and bylanes of this part of GHMC and SCB limits. Roads are okay but need a facelift with proper streetlights in pockets of the area. Civic amenities like public toilets are completely missing in this area. Hope the right department takes up the matter at the earliest.

There should be atleast one STP plant installed and the lake should be cleaned thoroughly.

NEW DELHI: The Special Cell of Delhi Police has arrested the kingpin of an interstate drug cartel and recovered heroin brought from Myanmar worth Rs 3 crore . A reward of Rs 1 lakh had been declared earlier for the arrest of Saidul Sheikh (27), who was using local suppliers in Delhi to distribute drugs.

Last year, police had arrested two members of the cartel, Baijur Rehman and Mohammad Abu Bakr Siddiqui, residents of Malda. The two accused were travelling to Delhi from north-east India. The cops were able to seize their stash of drugs but the kingpin of the cartel kept evading arrest.

DCP (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav said that Rehman and Siddiqui revealed that the consignments from Manipur were co-ordinated by Sheikh from Guwahati and were to be delivered to Delhi. “A non-bailable warrant and a reward were issued against him,” said Yadav.

Cops formed a dedicated team and laid a trap near Mujaffarpur and Malda to catch Sheikh. Finally, he was nabbed from Mujaffarpur. He was brought to Delhi to reveal the complete narcotic syndicate and to identify other associates who are still at large.

Sheikh told police that the cartel has circulated over 200 kg heroin in the past two years in Delhi-NCR. Police officers are trying to identify the other members of the cartel to establish the source of the heroin in Myanmar.

151,['14/01/2020'],"In Maoist-hit Gadchiroli, police conduct ‘doorstep delivery’ of licences, caste certificates; prep tribals for driving exam","This story is from January 14, 2020

Representative image

GADCHIROLI: Ajay Majji recalls how in 2009, he spent half a day walking 14km, crossing a dense forest teeming with wildlife , wading through rivulets to reach the tehsil office. The man from Mirdapalli village — located at the foothills of Maoist headquarters in Abujmadh on the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border — needed a caste certificate made. But this January when his son, Ashish, needed to get the same document, he had help from unexpected quarters — the certificate was delivered to the family by police.

In a novel initiative, Gadchiroli police is collecting documents door-to-door and later delivering licences and caste certificates — crucial to avail any government benefits — to people. Since December 2018, 2,700 people have benefited from the scheme. The move is part of an outreach initiative called ‘Project Pragati’ that aims to “win people over”, according to police officers.

Under the project, training sessions are also being held to help residents pass online driving exam, SP Shailesh Balkawade said, adding that police officers teach tribals how to differentiate between traffic signage and how to take the online driving test. Sub-inspectors Babasaheb Dudhal and Ganesh Raykar said that this week alone, 200 people from remote Bhamragarh tehsil will be trained to get their driving licences. Officers said that helping people get driving licences would allow them to have some means of income.

To distribute caste certificates, police are also organizing ‘jan jagaran melawa’ (mass awareness campaign rallies). The latest such meet was held on January 6 when 70 tribals from Nelgunda and Mirdapalli received caste certificates. In the past few months, those from remote villages of Tadgaon, Kothi, Pendhri and Bhamragarh have been able to get their documents with police aid.

SP Balkawade said that caste certificates are required to enjoy benefits under Forest Rights Act which includes piece of land (patta) for tilling and also community rights on the minor forest produce. “In many remote hamlets, tribals could not avail any of their rights under Forest Rights Act as they did not have the required certificates. They were also deprived of other benefits like education scholarships or housing schemes. So we decided to help them out.”

In fact, even in cases where a tribal has no document, the district administration can be approached. “In case someone has no document, the tehsildar issues a ‘self-identification’ certificate which is essentially the tehsildar vouching for the person’s identity and his bona-fide status as a resident of a particular place,” Balkawade said.

Collector Shekhar Singh, encouraging the police initiative, also had ensured that the process of completing the formalities of issuing the caste certificate were made simple without requiring any documents and also free of cost for the tribal. ""We have waived off the cost of Rs70 required towards issuing the certificates,"" he said.

Sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), Bhamragarh, Kunal Sonawane, added that tribal families are entitled to Rs20,000 as compensation upon demise of the breadwinner from natural causes and Rs4 lakhin case they die in a disaster, but they need a caste certificate to get these benefits. “The scheme was rolled out to ensure no one is deprived of these benefits.”

“We collect identification documents from families while patrolling their villages or during melawas. They are sent to the tehsil office together and once the caste certificates are ready we deliver them to the residents,” Sonawane said.

Asmita Raju Mahaka, a Madia tribal of Nelgunda, said that with the caste certificate she recently received, she would now be eligible for a piece of land. But Penta Kannake in Nelgunda was upset that he had been away when police had come to collect documents in his area. “I hope they come again soon. It’s my only hope.”

Nagpur: State director general of police Subodh Jaiswal, who was on a visit to Maoist-affected Gadchiroli on Monday, is learnt to have praised the efforts of the district police in being able to conduct the state assembly election last year without any incident to dent the polling process for the first time at least the last decade.

Jaiswal is learnt to have congratulated Superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade and his team for managing two elections in the tribal district where the Maoists oppose polling with threats and also sabotage activities.

The elections were held peacefully despite a major setback of losing 15 Quick Response Team (QRT) jawans and a civilian in a blast on May 1, 2019, at Jambhulkheda in a blast triggered by Maoists after torching 27 vehicles of a road construction company.

In the general election earlier in 2019, the Maoists had managed to trigger two blasts on polling day, and a day earlier, injuring two cops. There was also an attempt made on the returning polling party by Maoists but Gadchiroli police had managed to thwart the attempt.

Apart from managing two elections, the district police had managed to neutralize around seven Maoists and ensured surrender of 34 cadres including three cadres of Divisional Committee member ranks. They had also managed to arrest 27 cadres including seniormost leader Narmada Akka and her husband Kiran.

Agra: A week has passed since a probe report revealed a scam in the door-to-door garbage collection system, but the Agra Municipal Corporation is yet to file an FIR against those involved in the fraud case.

According to the report, which was tabled in the municipal board meeting on January 6 this year, five private companies entrusted with the garbage collection in the city were paid Rs 22.65 crore without verifying their work done.

An investigation had revealed that only 10.5 % of garbage collection was done in 83 wards of the city. The report claimed that the companies produced fake bills to get payments.

It was also found that a majority of the addresses and details of residents given by the companies as evidence of door-to-door garbage collection were fake.

On basis of the probe findings, municipal board of councilors had directed the AMC administration to file FIR against the private companies.

Reacting to the matter, mayor Naveen Jain said, “I will inquire with the senior officials regarding action being taken on decisions of the municipal board concerning the garbage collection scam. FIR will be definitely registered.”

Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Arun Prakash said, “Notices have been issued to the private companies, tasked with door-to-door garbage collection. We are waiting for their response after which legal action will be taken.”

Agra (South) MLA Yogendra Upadhyaya, who had attended the municipal board meeting, said, “I had decided to wait for 10 more days, i.e. till January 16, for the AMC administration to take action in this regard. The municipal commissioner is mandated to follow the decision of the municipal board, otherwise action will be taken against him. I will pursue the matter and make sure that it reaches its logical conclusion. Those involved in the scam will go to jail.”

The additional municipal commissioner, Vinod Kumar, had headed the three-membered committee constituted by Mayor Naveen Jain to probe the door to door garbage collection. The councilors had demanded copy of the probe report, which has not been provided so far.

We now seek greater public support in checking financial leakages termed corruption. The CBI office is also in Puducherry. People may approach them directly as well,” Bedi said, appealing to the public to join hands with her office in curbing corruption in the territory.

She said the round-the-clock control room in Raj Nivas receives petitions from various sources, computerises and forwards the petitions to the departments concerned and gets their acknowledgement to track the complaints.

Thiruvananthapuram: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala expressed concern over increasing atrocities against women and girl children in the state.

“Suicide of a victim and her family members in Kottayam sheds light on the horrendous experience that hapless victims and their families are forced to go through. Several young girls were killed in various attacks in different parts of the state in the recent times. Moral policing, physical abuse and attack on women and girl children are on a rise in the state. The government’s projection of Kerala as a women-friendly state is nothing but a hoax. Latest reports also indicate that Kerala records the highest number of suicide cases in the country,” he said.

Chennithala said government sponsored programmes such as ‘night walk’ do not yield any result on the ground. Police are in deep slumber when moral police go on a rampage. “It’s embarrassing to know that when a woman approached a police station to report harassment by a group of goons on Sanghumugham beach, she was confronted with counter questions by police as they wanted to know why was she loitering on beach in the dead of the night. The government should initiate strict action against such officials who behave irresponsibly,” he added.

The incident took place at 8:30am at Akash Ganga Hospital in Awas Vikas Colony.

AGRA: In a gut-wrenching incident, a stray dog entered the operation theatre (OT) of a private hospital in Farrukhabad city and attacked and killed an infant born a few minutes ago on Monday.

The incident took place at 8:30am at Akash Ganga Hospital in Awas Vikas Colony. Ravi Kumar, who works with a private finance firm, had come to the hospital with his pregnant wife, Kanchan, who was going through labour pain.

“Initially, the hospital’s nursing staff informed us that a normal delivery will be conducted, but moments later after consulting the doctor, they told us that my wife had to go for a caesarean. So, they took her to the operation theatre, and an hour later, they informed us that operation was successful and took Kanchan in a ward, while the baby was still in the OT. They told me to wait outside,” Ravi Kumar said.

“A few minutes later, the hospital staff came out shouting about a dog’s presence in the OT. Sensing danger, I rushed to the OT and saw my baby lying on the floor covered in blood. My baby had dog bite marks on his chest and left eyes. He was lying still with no movement. The dog again attempted to enter the OT while I screamed for help for my kid,” said Kumar, who had become father for the first time.

He added, “I confronted the doctors and hospital staff for the inhuman treatment and negligence, but instead of feeling guilty they offered me money and asked me to remain silent about the incident. They told me that my baby was stillborn and the dog entered the OT by mistake.”

District magistrate Manvendra Singh said, “Our probe found that due to negligence of the hospital, the dog took away the baby and killed him. A committee comprising doctors has been formed under the city magistrate, who will investigate as to how many illegal private hospitals are running in Farrukhabad. The report will be submitted in three days to me to take further action,” Singh said.

After the incident, Farrukhabad police lodged a FIR against hospital owner Vijay Patel and other staff members under Indian Penal Code (IPC) section 304-A (death by negligence).

By the time this report was filed, DM Farrukhabad ordered the hospital to be shut down, as the probe done by deputy CMO Rajeev Shakya had also found that the hospital had no valid papers and a licence to operate.

“When they returned in the evening, their daughter told him that at about 1pm Chavda had come to the house and started abusing her. He groped her and threatened to attack her with acid if she married anyone or even kill her,” a police official said.

The FIR states that when Chavda started slapping her, her cries for help drew their neighbour, Jayeshbhai. On seeing him, Chavda ran away from the house.

162,['14/01/2020'],Local panels to get 50% of forest-fire prevention funds,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Kozhikode: The state has decided to make its forest-fire prevention and management activities for the upcoming summer participatory. The forest department has issued directions that 50% of total funds allotted for forest-fire prevention be used for activities of the grassroots-level vana samrakshana samithies (VSSs), eco-development committees (EDCs) and forest development agencies (FDAs).

The move is expected to broad base the activities and add to the manpower on the ground. There are over 400 VSSs and 190 EDCs under the various territorial and wildlife divisions in the state.

Kerala witnessed 314 forest fires in 2018 affecting 1,114 hectares of land. Nearly 7,893km of fire lines were created during 2017-18 at a cost of Rs 23 crore.

“This year the head of the forest force has issued a directive to ensure that 50% of funds earmarked for fire protection be used for anti-fire activities of participatory forest institutions like VSS and EDC. The respective VSSs/EDCs will be provided Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 per hectare for undertaking fire-prevention measures in forest areas coming under them. VSS/ EDA members can become fire watchers and constitute fire gangs from among themselves,” said S R Radhakrishnan, assistant conservator of forests.

Forest department officials said this will ensure community participation, even among tribals, in forest-fire protection and also create awareness in communities about preventing fires caused by anthropogenic activities. He said the department has drawn up a fire plan and has classified the forests into three categories depending on the level of fire risk on the basis of incidents over the last five years.

A centralised control room is now functional and there were 45 fire incidents reported between December 24 and January 13 as per Fire Management Information System (FMIS), of which 43 were controlled burning carried out as part of fire-protection activities.

Meanwhile, citizen volunteer groups and environmentalists from across the state, who have come together under the Fire Free Forests collective, met authorities of the forest department and the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) on Monday with the plea for immediate steps to ensure the state free of fires in the upcoming summer season. The collective has called for constituting an independent fire force in the department, modernising fire prevention and control measures by deploying drones, and also increasing the allocation for fire-prevention measures.

Fire Free Forests representatives N Badusha, Anitha S , K M Sulaiman, Raheem Thalanad and Veena M were part of the delegation. They held discussions with P K Kesavan, principal chief conservator of forests and head of forest force, and principal secretary, revenue & disaster management Dr K Venu.

Badusha said methods adopted by the forest department to control forest fires are outdated and unscientific. He said involvement of district administrations, local self-government bodies and the SDMA should be ensured for fire-protection and control measures which are now mostly carried out by the department alone. “There is need for at least a fourfold increase in funds,” he added.

12-year-old Tanishka Awasthi

BHOPAL: A 12-year-old Indore girl — Tanishka Awasthi — might become the youngest person to appear for Class 12 Boards of Madhya Pradesh Board of Secondary Education — provided her examination application is approved by the education board.

Tanishka was learning ahead of her age and since no school was willing to accommodate her in a higher class her parents decided to homeschool her, after she completed Class 4. She took her Class 10 Boards last year and scored 65% in the exams.

“MP Board does not have provision for younger students to sit for Boards. Last year we had requested the then MP Governor Anandiben Patel to allow Tanishka to take the Class 10 exams. She was granted permission and she scored 65% in the boards. As per the MPBSE rules, there should be a gap of one year between Class 10 and 12 exams ... which is why we have again sought permission to let our daughter appear in the Class 12 Boards, without taking Class 11 exams,” said Tanishka’s mother, Anubha Awasthi.

“Tanishka is very bright. She was able to solve questions of Class 7 in Class 5 itself, but schools pressured her not to skip any class. When she was in Class 8, she could solve trigonometry of Class-10 level. Three years went by like this before we could get permission for her to sit for Board exams. Last year when the MPBSE allowed her to take the exams, she passed the exams with a good percentage”, said her mother.

“While the other state boards have provisions for younger children to take board exams early, we were told that MPBSE does not have any such rules. So, if we get the permission, Tanishka will be appear for private exams of Class 12, instead of regular in March this year”, she added.

Anil Suchari, secretary MPBSE told TOI that the application of the parents to let their daughter appear for the Class 12 exams is under consideration.

“This is the first time that such a request has been made in our state. The application is under consideration and a committee will decide if the student should be allowed to take the exams. We are yet to give our decision on the matter,” said Suchari.

Representative image

CHENNAI: The Madras high court has given the Centre three months to decide on amending the law to enable Doordarshan to live-stream top sports and entertainment events on its over-the-top (OTT) platforms, in addition to its terrestrial and DTH networks on free-to-air basis.

“This is a clear subject of policy decision to be undertaken by the government after examining various factors, as this will involve not only the appreciation of the substantive rights being claimed by the petitioner, but also the procedural mechanism for dissemination of transmission that may be dependent on contracts and other statutory regulations governing transmissions, the first bench comprising Chief Justice A P Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad said on Monday.

Leaving the issue to be assessed by the government, the bench said: “The government, therefore, should and must respond. We, therefore, direct the authorities to coordinate amongst themselves and such other necessary authorities who deserve to be consulted in the process and take an appropriate decision in the matter supported by cogent and plausible reasons, preferably within three months.”

The bench was passing orders on a PIL filed by sound engineer Aditya Modi, who wanted the government to amend the sports broadcasting law, as, at present, Prasar Bharati is not permitted to live-stream such events due to a restriction in the Sports Act. Modi contended that restricting the mode of free transmission of sports and entertainment information impinged upon the fundamental rights of a citizen to receive information through internet services, including all its forms.

Limiting retransmission to only through these two modes amounts to negating the right to free information of individuals through other modes, including OTT platform, he said, adding that citizens having access to the internet are being denied access to sports events of national importance and the like, as the Prasar Bharati is not permitted to adopt these methods due to the restriction contained in the Sports Act.

Opposing the plea, authorities, including Prasar Bharti, argued that none of the rights of citizens is affected, much less any violation of fundamental rights. There is neither any prohibition nor restriction so as to totally deprive any citizen of such free information or broadcast of sports programmes being relayed as per statutory provisions, they said.

Recording the submissions, the bench said: “There can be no gainsaying that the right to claim information through a particular electronic mode or application may by itself be not a fundamental right, but access to the internet is the norm...” They also added: “The material placed before us does not lead to any inference of arbitrariness or discrimination in the choice of mode of transmission by Prasar Bharati and the additional modes as suggested by the petitioner do not seem to have been asserted before the authorities in any form for them to respond to the same.”

Dharmaj town of Anand district unveiled its initiative of adding women’s names to Patel family tree on Sunday

VADODARA/ ANAND: When former finance secretary and ICS-officer-turned politician Dr H M Patel passed away in 1993, he was survived by five daughters. His youngest daughter is Dr Amrita Patel, who went on to serve as the chairman of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) – India’s apex board for dairy development.

However, the community tree of Patels of Dharmaj neither mentioned her or the names of four other daughters of their family.

On Sunday, the community tree got complete with the mention of all the five daughters of Dr H M Patel as the NRI-rich Dharmaj town of Anand district unveiled its latest initiative of adding names of daughters and daughter-in-laws to the Patels’ lineage.

A majority of Patels of Dharmaj are descendants of Ranga Patel, the patriarch, who had migrated from Virol village near Sojitra, to the present day Dharmaj before 345 years.

“Veteran Motibhai Amin had last updated the community tree of Chh Gam Patidar Samaj in 1924. After that the community tree of the samaj was updated in 2018 by the Bharat Patidar Samaj. But so far, there was no tradition of putting names of daughters and daughter-in-laws in the community tree,” said Rajesh Patel, part of team Dharmaj.

The team has been organising Dharmaj Day celebrations regularly as an attempt to connect generation next of NRI spread across the globe to their roots.

“For the first time, we (Dharmaj) have taken the initiative of adding names of daughters and daughter-in-laws to family trees. We have been able to trace the family trees to our patriarch Ranga Patel,” he said, adding that names of nearly 2,000 women have been so far added.

“We have initiated this as a pilot project through online and offline modes. The next step will be updating the entire community of Chh Gam Patidar Samaj,” he said.

In Patel community, Chh Gam (cluster of six villages) refers to Bhadran, Dharmaj, Karamsad, Nadiad , Sojitra and Vaso – the villages spread in the twin districts of Anand and Kheda – broadly referred as Charotar belt of Central Gujarat .

AHMEDABAD: A 29-year-old woman from the Walled City area lodged an unusual complaint at Danlimda police station against her husband and in-laws on Sunday. She alleged that her husband had concealed his homosexuality and same sex marriage in the UK. She also alleged that he suffered from a sexually transmitted disease and had hidden this at the time of their wedding.

Inspector V R Vasava of Danilimda police station said the accused is on the run. “The woman has submitted social media photographs of her husband’s same-sex marriage ,” Vasava said.

In the FIR, the woman has accused her husband, father-in-law and mother-in-law.

A police source said the accused had wed the woman in November 2019. Even after eight days of the wedding when her husband refused to consummate the marriage, the woman talked to her husband’s parents who took her husband to a hospital and did a medical check-up. “She has alleged that she was not informed of the result of the tests and when she inquired her in-laws and husband harassed her mentally and physically,” said the police source.

Even after the check-up her husband refused cohabitation, which increased the suspicions of the woman. She told her elder sister about the situation, but she told her that such things happened during the early days of marriage.

AGRA: Alleging that the medical examination of the injured student leaders was not done properly, the National Students Union of India (NSUI) and Samajwadi Chatra Sabha (SCS) members on Monday demanded superintendent of the police (city) Botre Rohan Pramod to order a medical re-examination.

The NSUI claimed that its state coordinator Ankush Gautam and secretary Satish Sikarwar had fractures in their right hand during the police lathi-charge at Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University’s Paliwal Park campus on Saturday.

Later, NSUI and SCS worker met Agra University vice chancellor Arvind Kumar Dixit raising objection over the proctorial board’s decision to prohibit entry of 13 student leaders of both the organizations on campus. However, the student leaders were not unsatisfied after discussion with VC.

NSUI spokesperson Apoorv Sharma said, “We had met SP City and informed him of police taking one-sided action against NSUI and SCS workers. No action was taken against Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), workers who were also protesting on campus. Only NSUI workers were beaten up and abused, and we have video evidence to substantiate our claims. We will go to court if police officers fail to provide us justice.”

NSUI state coordinator Ankush Gautam said, “I have swelling in both legs and am not able to move without support. State secretary Satish Sikarwar also has a fracture in his right hand. Besides, several other student leaders of NSUI and SCS are injured. After lathi-charge we were taken to the police station and later they took us for medical examination, which was not done properly.”

Talking to TOI, SP City Botre Rohan Pramod said he has taken cognizance of the issue raised by student leaders.

“Station house officer Hariparwat has been directed to call them and take the required action. In the entire matter, a case has already been registered against 40 unknown members of the ABVP, NSUI and SCS. Fair investigation will be ensured.”

On Saturday afternoon, ABVP activists had assembled at the Paliwal Park campus of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University to stage a protest against the recent violent clashes in Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University and demanded a ban on left-wing organizations on campus.

Later, NSUI and SCS members also gathered to counter the ABVP. Both sides soon started indulging in high-pitch sloganeering for around 40 minutes. Later, there was a minor scuffle between members of ABVP and NSUI which resulted in cane charge by the police.

171,['14/01/2020'],PWD says no incentives to complete work on time,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: In yet another major decision after increasing the defect liability period, the public works department (PWD) on Monday ended the practice of giving incentives to contractors who complete work on time. PWD minister G Sudhakaran said the clause 2112.2 of the PWD manual has been removed for this.

The department used to give 1% of the contract amount (maximum of Rs 4 lakh) as bonus for completing work within the contract period. The minister said when the contractor is obliged to complete work within the contract period, it is unfair to give bonus for that.

“Contractors have gained crores of rupees during the tenure of previous governments for completing works on time. The contractor, while signing the contract agreement, agrees to complete work within the stipulated period. The contract period is finalised based on scientific study. They normally get enough time to complete work during the period. So, it was decided to avoid wastage of money from public exchequer for such works. The clause 2112.2 in PWD manual has been removed. Directions have been given to revise PWD manual and standard building document,” the minister said.

Though the PWD decision would win accolades from public, it has not gone well with the contractors. The Kerala Government Contractors’ Association has decided to express their strong objection to the minister. “The decision could only destroy small-scale contractors. Has the Kochi Metro or the Vizhinjam port, taken up by high profile contractors, completed on time? The contractors do works amid various hurdles such as lack of materials, pending dues and opposition from local politicians. The bonus, though it was not a huge amount, could have been an encouragement,” said Varghese Kannampally, contractors’ association president.

Contractors said the government has revised various clauses that will affect small-scale contractors. “The government has to provide bitumen for works under Rs 1 crore. That is not being followed now. The government has also gone back from its promise of resolving issues over GST, pending dues, etc.,” he alleged.

Agra: At least two persons were killed and 16 others left injured when an Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation’s (UPSRTC) multi-axle luxurious passenger bus travelling in dense fog on Agra-Lucknow expressway fell into a ditch on Monday.

The accident occurred at 6:50 am, when the bus with 37 persons and four crew members on board while heading to state capital tried to avoid collision with a truck, which had broken down on the extreme right lane. Notably, the accident took place just 3 km away from the toll plaza.

According to police, a Rajasthan-registered goods truck broke down in the middle of its journey on Sunday night. But, it was not removed from the expressway, following which the driver lost control of the bus and the vehicle fell into the ditch near milestone ‘18.6’ of Fatehabad police limits in Agra district.

One of the deceased passengers was identified as Dinesh Shakya (44) of Bhagipur village in Etah district, while the other’s identity is yet to be ascertained.

“The injured passengers have been shifted to S N Medical College. Two are in critical state,” said Pramod Kumar, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Agra rural east. “While questioning the bus driver, named Raj Kumar, he claimed that he was driving between 40-50 kmph in dense fog when he saw a truck parked on the extreme right lane. In order to avoid a collision, the driver took a quick left turn, but couldn’t stop the vehicle from plunging into a ditch,” he added.

The ASP further said, “The fog was so dense on the expressway that it took me nearly an hour to reach the accident site. It is a matter of concern for us why the truck which broke down wasn’t removed from the stretch.”

A member of private concessionaire’s expressway patrolling team, on condition of anonymity, said, “Within 15 minutes of bus accident our team along with UPEDIA patrolling team reached the accident site and started rescue operation along with the cops. Last night, we did receive information about the broken down truck and UPEDIA patrolling team immediately installed a barricade around the vehicle with safety cones. Since our cranes were busy in two other accidents, the truck couldn’t be removed. The UP roadways bus had hit safety cones before falling into the ditch.”

K P Singh, the toll manager of Agra-Lucknow expressway operated by private concessionaire, said, “Our teams always respond to any accidents or break downs promptly and clear vehicles immediately. We will probe why a crane wasn’t made available to remove the broken truck from the stretch.”

In the affidavit, government said Rs 1 crore per year is required to provide free treatment for a child with a rare disease and there are 200 children requiring treatment. Thus, the government would have to set apart more than 48% of the budgetary allocation intended for treatment of the poor to provide free treatment to the children with rare diseases alone. Budgetary allocation for free drug distribution during 2019-20 was Rs 360 crore. Of the 15 known LSDs, five are treatable. Around 80% of the children affected with Pompe disease, which is one of the five treatable LSDs, succumb due to cardio respiratory failure, the affidavit said. While the average treatment cost of a single child with a weight of 20kg would be Rs 1 crore annually, around 20 renal transplantations or five liver transplantations or eight bone marrow transplantations can be carried out using such a fund.

These are life-saving medical interventions, government points out. “While many kids are waiting for such definite interventions with proven prognosis, it is highly unethical to channelize such limited funds for ERTs often with guarded prognosis at exorbitant cost,” the affidavit stated.

It would be catastrophic for the state government to attempt providing free treatment to patients with LSD, it is up to the central government to frame a national policy or work out a PPP model through National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority, considering the authority’s advantage of economy of scale and statutory backing, the court was informed by the state government.

Congress Candidate from Bhopal Loksabha Constituency Digvijaya Singh addressing media persons at PCC in Bhopal... Read More

Bhopal: In the wake of the widespread students’ protests across the country against the amended Citizenship Act, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh tweeted on the importance of role universities as “nurseries of all movements … where leaders are born.”

In back to back tweets, the former chief minister also took a jibe at the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his “bhakts” (followers).

Singh’s first tweet at 7:44am read: “Universities are the nurseries of all movements, not only political. This is where leaders are born. Didn’t Duke of Wellington say: The battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton.”

In another tweet 4 minutes later, the Rajya Sabha MP, wrote: “Unfortunately, we have a leader who has Graduated, or has done Masters in “Entire Political Science”. I am still hunting for the university, which offers such a course. I would be grateful, if any of the Bhakts helps me to find that University.”

Reacting sharply, state BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agarwal, said, “University is an institution for education and intellectual deliberations. Students in some universities, with active Left following, are resorting to violence. Are there only half-a-dozen universities in the country? Among the states, it is West Bengal and Kerala that saw violence. There again there is a presence of the Leftists.”

Agarwal claimed that Singh is inspired by “Marx, Macaulay and madrasas.”

“His allegations and statements are highly influenced by the three. For the BJP, university is a place where students get higher education. They should be allowed to study, and Congress should stop utilizing Left students’ violence to their own political advantage,” said Agarwal.

Congress strongly backed the former chief minister.

“Digvijaya Singh has rightly said that universities are nurseries where leaders are born. Most of our great leaders have once been student leaders. The youth is the future of the nation. This was recognized by former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi when he lowered the age of voting to 18 years. The youth believe in our Constitution and have full faith in it. Students have always played a major role in the country’s future,” said Shobha Oza, PCC media department chief.

AHMEDABAD: Zafar Ali Haliq, 25, an alleged ISIS operative who was nabbed by Gujarat anti-terrorism squad (ATS) and later handed over to Delhi special cell, had confessed to senior Gujarat police officials that two other persons from the Tamil Nadu module of ISIS were to join him in Vadodara. Zafar Ali had also been involved in setting up the ISIS module in Tamil Nadu, ATS said.

A top ATS official said that Zafar Ali’s two associates were to bring three pistols and 90 cartridges to Vadodara. The duo had killed a special sub-inspector, Wilson, 57, in Kaliyakkavilai in Kanyakumari, said an ATS official.

“They had plans to recruit and radicalize Muslim youths from Jambusar , set up an ISIS module here and possibly carry out a terror attack,” the ATS official said. He added their plans were to flee to UP after the terror operation.

“They were to join their handler Khanja Moideen in UP and flee to Nepal. But the special cell of Delhi police nabbed Moideen and his two associates, before they could do anything. During their interrogation, Zafar Ali’s name was revealed. He was from Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, and was staying in Gorva, Vadodara,” the ATS official said. Zafar Ali was arrested from Panchvati Circle in Vadodara by Gujarat ATS on Thursday.

Minister for labour Mahendra Singh Sisodia

BHOPAL: Minister for labour Mahendra Singh Sisodia on Monday hit back at BJP MP KP Yadav, who called him a ‘chamcha’ of senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia.

Speaking to reporters at a rest house in Ashoknagar, the minister said: “Proud that I am Maharaj Jyotiraditya Scindia’s Chamcha. What is the problem with that? Wasn’t BJP MP KP Yadav also a chamcha of Scindia when he used to run after his car?”

“Maharaj (Scindia is also present Maharaja of Gwalior royalty) gave me ticket; made my life worthwhile by making me a cabinet minister. I am fortunate to be the chamcha of such a leader. Why just chamcha, you can call me Kadhai (wok) also. Make me his chamcha and Kadhai together, and will remain so till the last moment of my life,” added Sisodia.

On Friday, at a BJP meeting attended by former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Yadav had allegedly called Sisodia a ‘chamcha’ of Scindia.

Speaking about himself, Sisodia said, “I will quit politics, but will never leave Maharaj Scindia.” State Congress media department chairperson Shobha Oza said the minister has given the BJP MP a befitting reply. “No one has the right to call a sitting MLA and minister a Chamcha. People have elected him and he is rightfully a representative of his constituency. How can an MP use this kind of language against any people’s representative? Therefore, the minister has given a befitting reply.”

BJP blamed it on the ruling party’s “culture”.

State BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agarwal said, “This is the Congress party’s tradition and culture. Mahendra Singh Sisodia has admitted it, which others in the party don’t. But from top to bottom and bottom to top ranks, this is how the Congress works. The Congress’ crisis is also based on the tradition of sycophancy.”

KP Yadav was earlier with the Congress. However, before 2019 LS polls , he switched sides and defeated Scindia contesting on a BJP ticket

179,['14/01/2020'],Maharashtra bamboo cover too goes down by 519 sqkm,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Photo used for representational purpose only

NAGPUR: At a time when dense forest area in Maharashtra has gone down by over 95sqkm, bamboo cover has also decreased by a mind-boggling 519sqkm, an area equivalent to five Koka wildlife sanctuaries (100 sqkm) in Bhandara.

As per Indian State of Forest Report (ISFR)-2019, the bamboo cover in Maharashtra was 15,927sqkm in 2017. It declined to 15,408sqkm in 2019, a loss of 519sqkm.

As per the report, total bamboo bearing area of the country is estimated at 1,60,037sqkm. Even as the ISFR states there is an increase of 3,229sqkm in bamboo bearing areas as compared to 2017, 12 of the 29 states in the country have shown reduction of 6,074sqkm bamboo area.

Experts have questioned the loss of bamboo cover in the state, especially when most of the paper mills have stopped purchasing it from the forest department and there is hardly any utilization for industry due to lack of units.

Madhya Pradesh has maximum bamboo bearing area of 20,000sqkm followed by Maharashtra 15,400sqkm. “The speed with which bamboo cover is being lost, the state will lose this tag. Maximum occurrence of pure bamboo has been observed in Maharashtra (810sqkm),” caution experts.

Bamboo consultant and expert Pratap Goswami said, “This time, the survey methodology has been more scientific and more accurate and hence the decrease has been evident.”

Secondly, Goswami added, “The decrease has to be matched with the working plan prescriptions to know the true picture. It should have not gone down when bamboo is not in demand from paper mills and industry. The Maharashtra Bamboo Development Board (MSBB) role is also not clear.”

However, TSK Reddy, managing director of MSBB, was quick to add, “We have nothing to do with bamboo exploitation. Our role is to facilitate farmers to grow bamboo on non-forest land. We have distributed 7 lakh seedlings free of cost to farmers.”

Sunil Joshi, chairman, Bamboo Society of India (BSI), Maharashtra chapter, said, “One of the major reasons for decrease is that forest department doesn’t have control over bamboo in their area. MSBB has also failed to give a push to grow bamboo on private lands. People are keen to grow bamboo, but they don’t know how to go about it.”

PCCF (production & management) Praveen Srivastava says, “Most of the areas under bamboo in Chandrapur, Gadchiroli and Amravati have been given away under community forest rights (CFRs) and Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA) 1996. We have no control over felling in these areas. We have sought a report to know the facts,” he said.

The Centre has promulgated Indian Forest (Amendment) Ordinance 2017 to exempt bamboo grown in non-forest areas from the definition of tree, by amending Section 2 (7) of the Indian Forest Act 1927, and thereby dispensing with the requirement of transit permit for its transport and economic use.

“Under the garb of felling on private lands, there is large-scale illicit bamboo felling from forest areas. Besides, there is no regulation on felling in PESA areas. FDCM, which is into commercial exploitation, has been handed over large chunk of bamboo area. Most importantly, forest fires too are responsible for decrease in the cover,” said wildlife conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar.

Bhamburkar warned, “Bamboo area is a major tiger habitat even outside protected areas (PAs). If bamboo vanishes, wildlife habitats will also shrink causing man-animal conflicts.”

“Bamboo is capable of thriving in an extreme range of climatic and edaphic conditions. With its wide distribution, bamboo also plays an important role in carbon sequestration, bio-diversity and soil moisture conservation. Loss of cover would mean huge environment damage,” says green activist Shrikant Deshpande.

180,['14/01/2020'],Dy CM bats for fast Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar Metro work,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Pune: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Monday stressed speeding up the land acquisition process for the third Metro line connecting Hinjewadi and Shivajinagar and lobbied for early execution of the Shivajinagar-Hadapsar stretch of the mass transit system.

Pawar, who is also the guardian minister of Pune, raised the issued at a meeting held in Mumbai on various projects carried out by the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA).

The NCP veteran also emphasized on good road and last-mile connectivity to the proposed airport in Purandar — a project that was announced in October 2016 but has not seen much development since then.

During Monday’s meeting, the new government made a department-wise review of the projects proposed by the previous dispensation and discussed deadlines of all the schemes executed by the PMRDA.

The deputy CM, however, did not discuss the proposed Hyperloop project connecting Pune and Mumbai during the meeting. In the past too, NCP had expressed doubts about the feasibility of the project.

While discussing the airport issue, Pawar sought details from the PMRDA officials about the city’s connectivity to the proposed Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje International Airport. The PMRDA has to construct a road from Wadki to Pargaon Memane village in the Purandar taluka for the last-mile connectivity to the proposed airport.

The second phase of the 16-km Metro line, from the civil court in Shivajinagar to Hadapsar (16km), also came up for discussions during the meeting. This facility assumes significance for the last-mile connectivity to the proposed airport.

The deputy CM pledged to speed up transfer of 6.25 hectares of government land to put the third line of Metro on the fast track — a facility that will reduce traffic snarls at the IT hub of Hinjewadi. The 23.3km third Metro corridor between Hinjewadi and Shivajinagar is expected to become operational by 2023.

Officials said the first 8km of the third line stretch (Hinjewadi to Balewadi) was likely to be operational by the end of 2021 and the rest of the stretch by January 2023. The entire Metro corridor was initially expected to be ready in 2022, but the deadline was extended because of some issues at two stretches — University Circle and Kamgar Putla slums.

The meeting also discussed the ring road and the affordable housing project, town planning scheme, the Indrayani River project and issues related to water.

Monday’s meeting was attended by PMRDA commissioner Vikram Kumar, planner Vivek Kharwadkar and additional commissioner Pravinkumar Deore, among others.

Pune: Plan your mini-vacations well in advance as 2020 brings two to five more long weekends than the previous year, which had around 10 such occurrences.

Travel firms are quoting at least 12 to 15 long weekends this year, depending upon the region of stay and workplace holiday policy. Having said that, these are still lower than the 16 long weekends observed in 2018.

Long-weekend list for this year shows that employees may have to take around 5-6 leaves during the year to get full benefit of the short breaks, far less than the last year’s estimate of around 13 leaves.

The highest number of long weekends will be in April and May, for which employees will have to take a few leaves in between the breaks to make the most of the mini-holidays.

Aloke Bajpai, chief executive officer and co-founder of travel and hotel booking website ixigo, told TOI, “We saw a 25% year-on-year rise in search queries around long weekends in 2019. We expect this number to further increase this year, with 15 long weekends spread out throughout 2020.”

Rajeev Kale, president and country head – holiday, Meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE), Visa, Thomas Cook (India) Ltd, said the company had observed a growing demand of 22% from Pune for long weekend bookings over the last couple of years. “While destinations like Udaipur, Hampi, Goa, Gokarna, Jaisalmer, Jaipur, Coorg, Kerala, and Pondicherry are domestic favourites, short-haul destinations with easy or no visa like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Malaysia, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Mauritius have been gaining popularity among Puneites,” he said.

Sabina Chopra, co-founder and chief operating officer, corporate travel and head industry relations, Yatra.com, said, “While it is still early for the Holi long weekend in March, we have witnessed 35% rise in overall booking enquires from Pune as compared to last year. Preferred domestic destinations are Bedse caves, Dehna, Mahabaleshwar, Lonavla, Panchgani and Nashik. International destinations include Thailand, Dubai, or middle eastern countries. In terms of accommodations, travellers have shown interest for resorts around Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary, beach view hotels around Diveagar and Kashid.”

Anand Menon, brand leader, travel tours, leisure travel brand of FCM Travel Solutions, said, “We expect about 30% rise in bookings from Maharashtra. A trend that seems to be picking up is Slow Travel, where people are booking lazy holidays with not too many planned activities.”

Daniel D’souza, president and country head, leisure, SOTC Travel, said, “In February, the long weekend is due to the festival of Mahashivaratri, and travellers can celebrate it at Haridwar, Khajurao or Mandi for a spiritually-enriched experience. Similarly, travellers can set off to Varanasi or Mathura in March to celebrate Holi.”

Peshwa Acharya , chief marketing officer, Sterling Holidays, said the company had seen more bookings for drive-through holidays for long weekends with places like Lonavla , Karjat , Igatpuri being quiet popular.

Coimbatore: People should stop burning tyres , rubber and plastic items , which emit toxic gases that lead to medical complications during the bhogi festival, doctors and pollution control board officials said here on Monday.

There was a 50% reduction in respiratory and eye problems reported during the bhogi last year because of the awareness programmes conducted by the Indian Medical Association (IMA), representatives said.

Addressing reporters in the city, secretary of Nursing Home Board of IMA Tamil Nadu Dr S Karthick Prabhu said that the association had created awareness on the hazards caused by burning rubber and plastic during the festival, at the behest of the Tamil Nadu pollution control board (Tnpcb). “After interacting with doctors, we found that the number of people admitted for respiratory problems and eye irritations caused by toxic gases had fallen by 50% last year,” he said. “Smoke and toxic gases cause reactive airway diseases.”

City-based pulmonologist Dr V Nandagopal said smoke and toxic gases from burning tyres, plastic and rubber affect senior citizens, children and those who had fallen ill recently and whose immune system is vulnerable. “Toxic gases and smoke cause asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and even lung cancer.”

In 2018, smog caused during bhogi led to cancellation of 20 flights in the state, Tnpcb assistant engineer P Ramesh said. “Thanks to the awareness programmes, pollution levels came down and not even a flight was cancelled last year,” he said.

Tnpcb is monitoring pollution levels at a residential area, a commercial area and an industrial area in the city. IMA has formed a team to work with Tnpcb on pollution-related issues.

Pune: A minimum of 75% attendance in two terms of Std X will be necessary for students to appear for the secondary school certificate (SSC, Std X) examination, this year.

The schools have been told to submit the attendance of students by February5, and according to the rules laid down by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, the students have to complete 75% attendance between June and October 15 and 75% in the second term from mid-October to February 5.

Secretary of the Pune division of the state board, B K Dahiphale, said, “Schools must send the attendance of students by February 15, with the defaulters’ list with a remark as 'no candidate' against their names. If the candidate falls short of the required attendance in any one term, he /she will not be able to appear for the exam.”

The notification said, school heads have been delaying the submitting of the attendance list and some of it was incomplete,. In such a situation, it was difficult for the board to take any decision against defaulters.

Hence, this year, a deadline of February 5, has been given to all schools to submit the attendance of the students who have filled the exam forms.

In the notification, Dahiphale said, “There are some students who deserve to be exempted due to poor attendance as they were undergoing some medical issues. However, if the proposals to exempt the students come late, it is not possible to exempt them even if they deserve it. Hence, we have strictly maintained that the division must receive details by February 5.”

For exceptional or emergency cases, the proposals will be considered after required proof if received after February 5, with a fine of Rs 500 after every late proposal.

Also, students whose attendance is less than 75% but more than 60% who have faced some medical emergency will also be exempted from the rule and allowed to sit for the exam after providing valid proof.

185,['14/01/2020'],VIRAL COMIC ART IN TIMES OF PROTEST,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Do you know when a piece of art is relevant? When it’s dated but still finds resonance in contemporary times. Like, for instance, searching on Twitter for RK Laxman and finding a series of tweets of users sharing cartoons of his that go as far back as the 60s with comments observing how ‘prescient’ he was, and ‘how some things never change’. Why, a cartoon of his about anti-Hindi agitations from the 60s will stun you with its contemporariness. Add some colour to it and you could easily believe that it was drawn yesterday. In the past few months, cartoons and comic art have taken on the job of conveying the anger of this country’s citizens, especially of its youth. Striking images with one-liners that drip of biting humour – making them perfect meme material – have become the language of protest and every aspiring cartoonist and graphic artist in the country is using social media as their platform to share their ideas: if it goes viral, even better.

A FEARLESS VOICE

It took Indian graphic artist and designer Orijit Sen 20 minutes to create the caricature unabashedly titled ‘Goons’. The graphic that he uploaded on January 6 on social media, shows the prime minister and home minister wielding lathis with their faces covered. Since that day, the post has been shared feverishly on various platforms.

“This is probably the most shared work of mine in recent times,” says Sen. As to how he came up with the idea, he says, “It was an immediate response to the rage I was feeling for the attack on JNU. I wanted to say that while the identity of the goons remains undetected, the people behind it were Amit Shah and Modi .” For the Goa-based artist, comic art is his medium to speak his mind fearlessly. “In today’s atmosphere, everybody is scared. But as an artist, I feel it is my job to go out there and speak up.” Courage, Sen says, “is not about lack of fear. It is instead to speak up despite the fear.” And his creating art of dissent, Sen hopes, will encourage other artists – be it musicians, dancers, poets – to stand up and speak as well.

“For me, a cartoon is protest art. That’s the reason cartoonists are always anti-establishment. Otherwise cartoonists become the puppet of the government,” says Mangaluru-based cartoonist Satish Acharya whose works enjoy immense popularity online and offline. That could be because his cartoons have a direct voice. “I draw more cartoons when people raise a dissenting voice, because I feel the voice of dissent makes our democracy more vibrant,” says Acharya.

THE GOOD AND BAD OF VIRALITY

“Two years back, I had done an illustration where I had portrayed Modi as Robocop who asked people who didn't stand up for the National anthem to ‘please stand up’. That satirical work really got popular and got shared a lot but eventually, it got people on the other side, the Sanghis , sharing it gladly too because they thought it portrayed their leader as ‘a superhero’. The purpose of the satire was completely lost and it made me wonder who I worked for,” laughs graphic artist and co-founder of Brainded , Appupen .

“My Modi-Shah cartoon was modified by the Sanghis to show them holding brooms and promoting the Swachh Bharath campaign,” says Sen. There is risk with every work that they put out admit the artists TOI spoke to. “I have received threats,” freelance cartoonist Nala Ponnappa reveals. Sen has family and friends asking him to ‘be careful because there is so much risk involved’. Acharya frets about lack of controls when it comes to free sharing. “People take the liberty to use them on their website, blogs. Sometimes even TV channels, newspapers and magazines use them without taking your permission. So, you end up losing your income opportunity.” Acharya also talks about the art work getting distorted by political IT cells. “They could add their own character/narrative/dialogue keeping cartoonist’s signature intact! This is dangerous and should be considered a criminal act,” he says.

SELF-CENSORING WORK

In these times where everyone is quick to take offense, do they, as cartoonists and comic artists, selfcensor their works? “Every artist has an in-built personal code that he uses to determine what he wants to make, so that way, yes, I do assess my work before I put it out there,” Appupen says. “I can’t touch much on pornography,” Ponnappa says before recalling advice he’d received from his mentor, Abu Abraham. “Years ago, Abu had told me, ‘Stay out of religion. I haven’t touched that subject much except maybe when it’s related to politics.”

THE GOOD OL’ DAYS

Compare comic art going viral today to pre-internet times, and the way the cartoons were created and dispensed will seem pre-historic. Freelance cartoonist Nala Ponnappa remembers opening newspapers during the Emergency to see cartoonist Abu Abraham leaving his cartoon space blank. “I was working as an architect during the Emergency. The atmosphere was different from what it is today. There was so much censorship that Abu would very often leave an empty space where his cartoon should have been. Ultimately it shows you that freedom of expression is extremely important,” Ponnappa says.

“If you drew an impactful cartoon, the best reaction you received was calls, postcards and letters from your readers. Of course, it would be even better when they called the editor to congratulate your work,” says VG Narendra, managing trustee of Indian Institute of Cartoons. But unlike today’s atmosphere of fear, Narendra admits that there was space to critique leaders. “Cartoonists would lampoon and criticize the ruling government. I remember making a rather critical cartoon of Indira Gandhi for Shankar’s Weekly and it was well received. Today, leaders do not encourage this kind of art,” he adds.

186,['14/01/2020'],BJP ‘special group’ to help Hindu immigrants get citizenship under CAA,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Dehradun: The BJP state unit has formed a “special group” to help Hindu immigrants get citizenship under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which is likely to be implemented by the end of the month in Uttarakhand.

The CAA came to effect on January 10 this year. The group will headed by former Dehradun BJP president Vinay Goyal and will facilitate Hindu migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh living in different parts of the hill state. “We will help Hindu immigrants fill the CAA form and furnish documents to the nodal official appointed by the central government in Dehradun,” said Goyal.

Goyal added that the process of granting citizenship to Hindu immigrants would be rolled out by January-end. “Our volunteers will hold a series of workshops. Hindu immigrants will be informed about the checklist of the documents required for filling the CAA forms,” he said.

Shankar Chakraborty, a Hindu immigrant from Bangladesh, curtrently living in Sitarganj in Udham Singh Nagar district, told TOI, “Everyone in our community is ready with all the documents required for filling up the CAA forms. We are just hoping that one nodal official of CAA is appointed in Udham Singh district so we don’t have to travel far to get these formalities done.”

“Everyone in my family is eagerly awaiting granting of citizenship, so we get new identities as Indians,” said Babu Ram, a Hindu immigrant from Pakistan.

The CAA, which officially came into effect on January 10 this year, has triggered sporadic protests across the hill state.

187,['14/01/2020'],Use ‘wall of happiness’ for a smokeless Bhogi,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Trichy: For a smokeless Bhogi festival celebration this Pongal, Trichy City Corporation has appealed to the residents to make use of the two ‘walls of happiness’ facilities in the city to place used clothes and blankets. Instead of burning the discards, the civic body has been insisting residents to celebrate Bhogi by handing over the discards at the nearest micro compost centres (MCCs) for scientific recycling.

To encourage the concept of reuse, thereby indirectly reducing waste generation, the corporation is operating a couple of ‘wall of happiness’ facilities on Allithurai Road and near Srirangam Rajagopuram. The facilities bridge people looking forward to donating the gently used clothes and the economically-backward section seeking used clothes. The corporation through the sanitary supervisors and field workers has been sensitizing the residents across 65 wards since the past week to place the gently-used clothes and blankets at the ‘wall of happiness’ facility. To avoid air pollution caused by the burning of waste, sanitary supervisors will monitor the vulnerable spots in the four zones, officials said.

“People can place clothes and blankets in the wall of happiness. This will reduce the city’s waste generation as well,” a sanitary official with Trichy City Corporation said. The civic body also maintained that people can hand over recyclable waste and plastic at any of the 31 micro compost centres of the corporation or during the doorstep waste collection.

“Tyres and other combustible waste can be used as refuse-derived fuel (RDF). We have been transporting such kind of waste to cement factories in Ariyalur where they are used as fuel in furnaces,” the officials said. Though authorities maintain that the practice of people burning waste during Bhogi has come down significantly, parts of the city near Gandhi market, Thiruvanaikoil and EB Road localities have witnessed incidents of burning waste in the open in recent years. Officials said that people in the localities were sensitized about the hazards.

KOLKATA: Students of Ballygunge Science College joined the protest against CAA on Monday by creating a human chain, taking out a rally and holding demonstrations on campus. Several hundred teachers, research scholars and students of the college participated in the protest that started around 2.30pm and continued till evening.Teachers and students who took part in the rally said they were protesting against the violation of democratic rights and the attempts by the government to divide the country on religious lines.“Those who assaulted students and teachers in JNU and earlier in Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia University are fascists. These attacks are not only on students or teachers but also on educational institutions. No campus in the country is safe any more. The first targets of fascism have always been the intelligentsia,” said Parthiba Basu, head of the department of zoology.“These attacks are intricately linked with the programme to divide the country on the basis of religious faiths. Students protesting against this are true patriots. They are fighting for the democracy and constitution of our country. The teachers stand shoulder to shoulder with them,” Basu added.From the college, the protest march made its way to the Hazra crossing before travelling back to the campus. It was preceded by a human chain created by the participants on Ballygunge Circular Road that did not disrupt traffic movement. At the end of the march, protest meetings and demonstrations continued on the campus. Students and teachers said that despite the protesters being attacked at JNU and Jamia Millia University, the authorities of the two varsities did not act.“I took part in the rally to protest against the violence meted out to the students of JNU. It is a very unfortunate incident.

BHOPAL: In a shocking murder reported in Talaiya locality on Sunday night, two brothers allegedly attacked and stabbed a 20-year-old youth over an old rivalry, merely 50 feet away from Talaiya police station. When the youngster’s friend intervened, the accused stabbed him too in the foot and fled the spot. The victim, with stabbing wounds in his chest, rushed to Talaiya police station and fell unconscious on the stairs.

Police and locals rushed the injured to Hamidia hospital in an auto-rickshaw where the victim was declared dead on arrival; his friend is undergoing treatment. SHO Talaiya HC Ladia said that deceased Rupesh Batham, 20, a resident of Bhoipura, was a fisherman. His friend and complainant Shahbaz Khan alias Kallu, 17, a resident of Jogipura in Budhwara, told the police that he had dinner at home and went out for a walk on Sunday night.

Around 11.45 pm, he reached in front of Kali Temple, merely 50 feet away from Talaiya police station, where the victim Rupesh was standing, and the friends started chatting.

191,['14/01/2020'],Loads of sugarcane arrive to sweeten Pongal festival,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Coimbatore: Truckloads of sugarcane reached the markets here on Monday, ahead of the Pongal festival .

Though wholesalers and retailers said that the business was dull than the previous years, they are hopeful of the upcoming days. “Last year, we sold at least 12 loads of sugarcane on the day it reached the wholesale market. But, this year, we managed to sell only half of that. Even though the business has started on a dull note, we hope that it would pick up in the days before the festival,” said Mohammed Nawaz, a wholesaler at Ukkadam.

The cost of sugarcane is almost same as the last year and is expected to fall further, Nawaz said. “A bundle containing 20 is sold for Rs 300 to Rs 450. They need to be sold within a day or two before the leaves wither. If not, nobody would buy,” he told TOI.

The traders buy sugarcane from Melur in Madurai, Trichy, Mettur and Sankagiri and bring it to the wholesale fruit market at Ukkadam. From there, it is purchased and sold in retail in Pollachi, Mettupalayam and at the markets in the city including those at Kavundampalayam and Poo Market at RS Puram. At retail markets, a pair of sugarcane is sold for Rs 60 to Rs 80.

The business is dull ever since the city corporation shifted the fruit market from Ukkadam to Pullukadu to provide land for the construction of the Ukkadam Flyover, retailer Badhusha Moideen said. “At Ukkadam, the market was on the main road and commuters used to buy from us. But, here, we hardly get any customers. It’s been almost a day since we started selling, but had hardly sold 10 bundles,” he said.

The burglaries were reported from Sharda Suman and Vighnaharta housing societies. In both the incidents, the suspects entered the premises after breaking the locks of the unattended flats.

On January 9, the suspects decamped with gold and silver ornaments worth Rs2.33 lakh from the flat of Siddheshwar Kore (40) of Sharda Suman Society. “The theft occurred when Kore was not at home,” an officer from the Chikhali police said.

The second burglary was at a flat in Vighnaharta Society on January 11.

Trichy: Earthen pots, an inseparable identity of Pongal festivities, are not much in demand this time, according to potters in Trichy. With only days left for the traditional thanksgiving festival of the state, potters said the business is dull even though the price of pots has not increased that much.

As people prefer cooking the signature dishes, Ven Pongal (plain Pongal) and Sakkarai Pongal (Sweetened Pongal), of the Pongal festival in clay pots in a traditional style, usually the sales of clay pots used to pick up during the season. Apart from the permanent shops, temporary stalls would often crop up near Melachinthamani and Gandhi market localities for Pongal festival. However, the sales of clay pots have not gained steam this year. “This year’s Pongal festival is dull. Despite the copious flow of water in the Cauvery, the sales of pots have not been picked up so far,” A Rukmini, a pot seller from Melachinthamani, said. The potters have exclusively designed Pongal pots weighing from 1 kg to 3 kg. The price of a one-kg Pongal pot is Rs 120. They said that city dwellers did not arrive as expected to purchase clay pots.

It seems that college managements and private event organisers in the city who have been hosting community Pongal festival in a traditional manner have come to the rescue of the potters to an extent. “College students purchased pots in bulk quantity,” Rukmini added. The potters, however, hoped that the sales would pick up ahead of the Kaanum Pongal (January 17) as traditional games including Uriyadi (pot breaking) contest will be organized during the time.

194,['14/01/2020'],"Goa gets standing committee for MSMEs to monitor, reform sector","This story is from January 14, 2020

Panaji: In a bid to support micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the state, the Goa government has constituted a state-level standing committee on MSMEs that will not only monitor all initiatives, but also recommend reforms for the sector.

MSMEs in Goa said issues concerning Goods and Services Tax (GST) refunds, access to finance, and delayed release of payments by government bodies continue to dog the sector, which contributes 28.8% to the national GDP.

The state-level standing committee will be chaired by chief secretary Parimal Rai with secretaries of finance, labour, factories and boilers, transport, law, revenue, agriculture and industries departments making up the members.

Chairman of National Council of MSME, Assocham, Manguirish Pai Raikar, who recently met Union minister of commerce Piyush Goyal, discussed some of these issues with the Centre and requested the Centre to resolve the problems faced by the sector.

“A common grievance of MSME sector is delayed payment for goods or services delivered from clients, which includes government departments and public sector undertakings. The GST refunds have also been delayed for over six months and this leads to a liquidity crunch for MSMEs,” Raikar said.

He further said that banks also hesitate to disburse loans to both existing and new MSMEs and thus the lack of finance prevents MSMEs from expanding operations and could also result in loan defaults.

State government officials said that the standing committee will try and address some of these issues by discussing it with the Reserve Bank of India, whose deputy general manager will serve on the state-level standing committee.

Raikar said that government officials, who create road blocks and harass entrepreneurs, need to change their attitudes. “It is not only the ease of doing business that is important, but there is a dire need of improving the system to have ease of running the business,” Raikar told TOI.

Raikar has also raised these issues with the Union minister and high-level officials of the central government, including finance, industry, commerce, textiles, railways, corporate affairs, labour and others.

Coimbatore: Three months after water contamination was reported from Azad Nagar at Karumbukadai, the city corporation and the private firm implementing the 24/7 water supply project have replaced the old damaged pipeline in the area with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes.

Workers of the Suez India Private Limited, who had been trying to spot the leaks, found that the pipeline was damaged at several places. “Sewage was getting mixed with drinking water. Instead of repairing all the leaks, which was cumbersome, the corporation decided to replace the pipes,” said an official. “The pipes were damaged while carrying out underground drainage (UGD) project.”

Based on the directions of the corporation, the firm replaced the old 110mm pipeline on the 1.5km stretch with HDPE pipes. “As a part of the 24X7 water supply project, the firm had decided to replace the pipeline in the area in the fourth year of the project. But, it decided to take up the work after receiving several complaints,” the official said.

“They laid 75mm HDPE pipes for 900 metres, 110mm pipeline for 101 metres, 160mm for 420 metres and 200 mm for 30metres. Thirty-five houses in the locality have been given connection and work is on to include the rest of the houses,” he told TOI. “As of now, the locality gets water from the master reservoir in Town Hall. A proposal has been made to construct a new tank at Ukkadam near the sewage treatment plant (STP). After the construction is over, water will be supplied to the area from that tank.”

Laila, a resident of Azad Nagar, thanked the corporation for installing the new pipeline. “We used to get foul smelling water. After we escalated the issue, the corporation stopped supplying water through pipeline and arranged trucks to supply water to the area. The new pipeline was fixed just days ago. We started getting clean water two days ago.”

Trichy: Traditional jaggary producers have raised apprehension about the sale of low quality jaggary as organic products. Seeking stringent steps to contain fake jaggary brands, which may have adverse health effects apart from affecting their sales, jaggary producers have sought authorities to create awareness among people.

Jaggery is an important ingredient in the preparation of sweet Pongal. Since people prefer organic items, traders too started to stock up organic varieties of jaggery (Vellam in Tamil) and palm sugar (Nattu Sarkkarai) for the Pongal festival.

Though people are willing to use organic products, they have no clue to differentiate between genuine organic products and duplicates. Utilizing the opportunity, a few traders are making money by selling sub-standard products, said organic farmers.

K N Easwarmoorthi, organic jaggery and palm sugar producer from Erode, said that nowadays ordinary jaggery contains hydrosulphate, superphosphate and 30% to 40% of white sugar. These are not good for health, he said.

“We use sodium bicarbonate in a permissible volume for purification purpose. Moreover, we are raising the sugarcane in an organic method. People should first learn to identify the right quality before buying jaggery. However, they often fall prey to a few traders who are selling sub-standard products with attractive package,” he stated.

A section of retail traders buy jaggery and palm sugar for Rs 50 per kg and sell them for Rs 75 per kg as organic products. Price of ordinary jaggery is ranging from Rs 50 to Rs 60. With little knowledge about organic jaggery and palm sugar, consumers buy those items for a higher price, he alleged.

“Since our products are high in quality, we cannot compromise on the price, which often leads to slowdown in sales,” Easwarmoorthi said.

Though people have knowledge about organic and non-organic products, those who afford to spend money alone prefer genuine products. However, others compromise the quality due to the high price fixed for the organic products, B Rajendran, a retail trader from Woraiyur, said.

The food safety officials should take stringent action against those traders who mislead consumers. The government should also spread awareness among people about these products, he added.

Representative image

PUNE: A fraudster duped an employee (36) of a prominent telecommunication company of Rs1 lakh on the pretext of offering him discount on a sports utility vehicle he was keen to buy.

The fraudster told the victim to pay just Rs10 online for the registration of his cell phone number for availing the discount on the sports utility vehicle (SUV). He managed to get the details of the bank account and United Payments Interface (UPI) identity of the telecom firm employee by sending a link. Within seconds, he siphoned off Rs1 lakh from the victim’s bank account through two transactions on December 1 last year.

The victim immediately approached the cybercrime cell and lodged a complaint. A case under the relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act was registered at the Airport police station on Saturday.

Police said the telecom company employee wanted to buy an SUV. While surfing the automobile-related websites, he came across a discount offer of up to Rs2.5 lakh on the SUV.

“When he contacted the cell phone number mentioned on the site, he was provided with another number,” said an officer from the Airport police.

When the victim dialled that number, the person on the other end introduced himself as the sales executive of a car dealership. “The bogus sales executive told the victim that he needed to register his cell phone number to avail the offer. He was also told that he would have to pay Rs10 for registration,” the officer said.

When the fraudster asked the complainant about the mode of payment, the latter said he could transfer the money through a digital wallet. The bogus sales executive then sent a link on the complainant’s cell phone and told him to forward it to another number. “After the complainant followed the direction, he received another link for paying Rs10,” the officer said.

The name of the bank, UPI ID and the amount to be paid had to be filled up in the second link. “The complainant gave all the data and within seconds he received two messages from his bank about Rs1 lakh being debited from his account. He first contacted the customer care number of the bank and blocked his bank account, net banking facility and the debit card,” the officer said.

A cybercrime police probe revealed that the complainant’s money was transferred to an account in a private bank. “We are gathering details of the account holder,” the officer said.

198,['14/01/2020'],Mohan Veena finale for rumination on MS,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt

AHMEDABAD: After his recital, Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt glided backstage through clusters of fans. He negotiated the notes of adulation as easily as his fingers sweep across his slide guitar, the Mohan Veena . “You are a rock star!” one among a group of musical notables cried out to him. Even after Pandit Bhatt’s concert ended, rasikas lingered like an echoing twang.

Pandit Bhatt’s tour de force was explained by Amita Dalal, a sitarist who considers him her mentor. “Guruji opened with Nat Bhairav. Pandit Ravi Shankarji had created this beautiful raga ,” she told TOI. “It is serene and divine.” Rasikas’ rush for selfies with Pandit Bhatt was perhaps an attempt to capture that rapture for social media permanence.

Talking of endlessly self-revitalizing memories, the first baithak — on Day 12, Sunday — presented M S Subbulakshmi’s art. “MS”, as her devotees call her, is not a legend trapped in archives. In countless households in South India, and in temples across the country, she is the voice of daily mantras. She is the introduction to Carnatic music for cultural experimenters. She is the inspirer of arcane debates among the purists.

On Sunday, Dr Jayanti Ravi — a bureaucrat and musicologist — encapsulated MS’s oeuvre in one baithak. To clarify MS’s influence in the time available, Ravi needed to, in William Blake’s words, “Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand/And Eternity in an hour”. Ravi’s selection pulled off that Blakean miracle.

“We began with two lines of Venkatesa Suprabhatam,” Ravi told TOI. “That exemplified the fact that M S Subbulakshmi’s birth was a new dawn in music.” Then Ravi and her group essayed a famous daru varnam, which has lyrics, jathis (syllables delineating a talam), and sahityam ( literary element ). “We rendered ‘Maate malayadwaja’ in Khamas. Krupa danced to it,” Ravi said. “The performance was katha nritya geetam (story, dance, and song).” She said the form was chosen because the musical component in isolation might have pleased only the aficionados.

“The main piece was ‘Bhavayami Raghuramam’. It is Ramayana recounted in Sanskrit,” Ravi said. The song unravels in a raga-mala: Saveri, Natakuranji, Dhanyasi, Mohanam, Mukhari, Poorvi Kalyani, and Madhyamavati. Saveri returns for the climax.

A few other MS masterpieces followed. “We presented ‘Hari tuma haro’, ‘Madhurashtakam’, a Dhanashree tillana, and a snatch from ‘Vishnu Sahasranamam’,” Ravi said. “The concluding piece was ‘Maithreem Bhajata’.” The composition urges people to seek a life of meaning; Saptak provided a hallowed stage for pondering that counsel.

COIMBATORE: A 34-year-old man was arrested by the Kattoor police on Sunday for posing as a cop and threatening a schoolteacher.

Police identified the arrested as G Prasanth Kothari, 34, of Ram Nagar in the city. Prasanth, who was working in an auditor’s office, was booked under Section 170 (personating a public servant) and Section 506 (i) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code

The arrest was made based on a complaint from S Rajeswari, 49, a teacher in a private school from Sangamam Nagar in Podanur. In her complaint, Rajeswari said she often visited a textile shop owned by Prasanth Kothari’s elder brother Pradeepkumar at Ram Nagar.

Three years ago, Pradeepkumar sought Rajeswari’s help to expand his business. She, along with a few other teachers, pooled in Rs 30 lakh and lent it to him, a police officer said. “But, Pradeepkumar faced huge loss in the business and lost all the money. He started avoiding Rajeswari. She got worried and started pestering him for money,” the officer said.

A few days ago, Prasanth Kothari called her from a new number and introduced himself as Sadasivam, a inspector of police at the Kattor police station. “He asked her to come to the station with her son. Later he called her and told her to come to the city police commissioner’s office and threatened to register an FIR against her for repeatedly ‘torturing’ Pradeepkumar for money,” the police officer said.

Rajeswari recorded the call and produced it to the Kattoor police. Based on a complaint, they lodged a case and arrested Prasanth Kothari on Sunday evening. Later, he was remanded in judicial custody and lodged at the Coimbatore Central Prison .

relieved residents: The blockage in the manhole had led to overflowing sewage lines in Vallakkadavu and nearby... Read More

Thiruvananthapuram: After an intense face-off, the National Highways Authority of India backed down to allow the Kerala water authority’s sewerage division to dig up the newly widened portion at Enchakkal Junction to restore a manhole which got buried under the asphalt. KWA initiated the work on Saturday.

On the first day itself, KWA was able to clear the blockage in the manhole which had led to overflowing sewage lines in Vallakkadavu and nearby areas. “After identifying the manhole, we were able to clear the block after opening it. The issue of overflowing sewage has been resolved. This has been troubling local residents for a while,” said a KWA official.

The State Human Rights Commission had intervened after areas such as Vallakkadavu, Karali and Enchakkal were affected. The work was delayed after NHAI asked KWA to adopt trenchless technology instead of digging up the recently paved road, which the latter rejected.

Meanwhile, traffic congestion at Enchakkal Junction, which was leading to snarls on the national highway, is likely to intensify due to the work. KWA has barricaded the middle of the junction for the work and sources said police are not planning any traffic diversions.

KWA officials said the entire work would take around two weeks to complete. “We have resolved the issue of the block. Now, we have to replace the brick manhole with a concrete one for better stability,” officials said.

In order to prevent digging in future, NHAI had suggested that KWA construct manholes on both sides of the national highway and connect them through horizontal drilling. However, KWA ignored the request citing shortage of funds.

Enchakkal is only one of many traffic choke points on the national highway. The junction has direct access to two main roads – one from Vallakkadavu and one from East Fort.

NHAI allowed KWA to dig up the junction on the condition that the portion will be restored as per its standards. “Several road safety issues are caused due to the negligence of agencies like the KWA in properly restoring dug up portions on national highways. So strict guidelines have been issued for such work,” said NHAI sources, also voicing concern over traffic congestion at Enchakkal.

201,['14/01/2020'],"Private schools should give info under RTI, says commission","This story is from January 14, 2020

Chennai: The Tamil Nadu State Information Commission (TNSIC) has held that private schools in the state will have to furnish information under RTI, especially those receiving financial assistance from the government.

This was the gist of an order passed by information commissioner S Muthuraj on December 2, 2019, while adjudicating an RTI application filed by M Kannan with the Srimathi Saraswathi Muthusamy Global School in Old Pallavaram.

In October 2018, Kannan had filed an RTI with the school asking for details such as number of sections in each grade, number of teachers, their qualification and remuneration, and details about the headmaster. He approached the commission with a second appeal after his RTI and first appeal went unanswered. During the hearing, he clarified that he was not a third party as children of his close relatives were studying in the school.

The school’s legal advisor Prasad Madhavan told the commission that they were a private school following EDEXCEL, UK curriculum, and hence did not come under the purview of the RTI Act. However, as a respect to the commission, he submitted the information requested by the applicant.

But Muthuraj invoked Section 19 (8) (a) to justify that the school had to give information under RTI. He said private schools were run through trusts recognised by the government. It was the government’s responsibility to ensure safety, security, health and rights of students and employees. Muthuraj said in case of aided or public schools, vital information could be obtained by parents to give a solution to issues. But in private schools, information denied would deny justice to parents.

The school in question was run by a trust and both central and state governments provided it tax exemptions and benefits. It was also under the purview of the RTE Act. Schools get subsidised power and water, vehicles registered in the trust’s name are given concession and benefits, he said.

Muthuraj said parents had every right to get information about schools in which their wards studied. The information includes details about management, correspondents, teaching and non-teaching staff as well as driver and attenders. Muthuraj cited Article 19 of constitution and said the school was not exempted under RTI Act.

Dehradun: A big cat that had mauled a 45-year-old woman of Dhari village in Tehri Garhwal last week was on Monday shot dead by a team of three shooters headed by Joy Hukil following forest department orders. The same leopard is believed to have killed three villagers in Bansi and Papdasu Rudraprayag forest division in November and December last year.

Around that time, the leopard was once shot by the shooter but the big cat had managed to flee from the spot in an injured state. The leopard was around eight-years-old, and had come to prey in the area early on Monday and had allegedly killed a cow on Sunday. Earlier, a woman, who had gone to collect fodder from the forest, was also killed by the animal.

Dharam Singh Meena, DFO of Narender Nagar forest division said, “The man-eater has been shot dead, and we have also recovered the bullet which was fired at it earlier in Rudraprayag forest division near Papdasu village in an attempt to eliminate it. It is the same leopard that had killed a woman in Dhari village. The post-mortem report also confirmed the presence of the woman’s hair in the animal’s intestine.”

Another forest official told TOI, “After the bullet injury, the leopard had become more furious and killed one more woman in Narendra Nagar. So it was best to kill it.”

Speaking to TOI, sharpshooter Joy Hukil said, “We had orders to kill the man-eater in Rudraprayag forest division and on December 10, we had received orders for Narendra Nagar forest division also. After keeping cages for trapping the big cat for the past three days, we could finally put it down on Monday morning.”

Bhopal: About 200 guest faculty teachers from the state who were staging a protest in the state capital had a miraculous escape early Monday when the tent in which they were sleeping was set on fire by miscreants. Talaiya police have registered a case against the accused who remains unidentified.

Quoting the complaint, police said the accused poured kerosene on one side of the tent in which the guest faculties, who have been protesting for the past two months at Shahjehani Park in Talaiya locality, and set it ablaze early morning. Around 200 protestors including women were sleeping in the tent when the incident took place.

However, due to winter and due on the fire could not spread.

The protestors have alleged that it was a conspiracy to burn them alive when they were in their sleep. They alleged that some of them spotted four miscreants fleeing from the spot after the incident.

Senior police officers along with FSL team investigated the crime scene after the incident and recovered a bottle partially filled with kerosene from near the spot. Senior administration officials and police teams visited the spot.

SHO Talaiya HC Ladiya told TOI that complainant Surjeet Bhadouria, 42, a resident of Gwalior who is posted as guest faculty at Balaji College in Mihona town of Bhind district has stated that for the past two-month guest faculties have been protesting demanding regularisation at Shahjehani Park. He said at around 2 am on Monday when he along with other protestors were on rest in the tent put up at the park, he felt strong smell of some inflammable liquid. He told his colleague Dr Manish Kumar about it. While they were talking about the smell, they spotted that the tent material on one side caught fire. They raised an alarm and ensured all rushed out out in open under safety. By that time some part of the tent material had burnt.

Another protestor Dr JP Chouhan, who hails from Umaria and was present during the incident told TOI, that the fire doused by itself as the cloth was wet due to dew. He said they spotted four miscreants running away from the spot. The accused tried to set ablaze other part of tent too, but the fire did not start. He said that had the fire spread it would have endangered the lives of around 200 protestors present in the tent.

SHO Ladiya said that police team had visited the spot around 1.30 am and found everything all right. After the incident was reported ASP Arvind Dubey along with FSL team visited the spot and the cops recovered a kerosene bottle. The miscreant might have poured kerosene over the tent and set it afire. A case has been registered and investigations were on.

HYDERABAD: The Telugu Desam Party, which was in power in the undivided Andhra Pradesh for over 17 years from 1983 to 2004, is now struggling to make its presence felt in the municipal elections in Telangana.

Though TDP national president N Chandrababu Naidu had given the green signal to party leaders from Telangana to contest as many seats as possible in the municipal polls, TDP failed to get candidates to enter the fray in all the 3,000-odd wards. Less than 400 candidates filed nominations for over 3,000 wards.

“We did not select candidates. We allowed filtration i.e., those interested to contest on TDP ticket to come forward voluntarily. This was to ensure that only loyal TDP candidates will contest and the possibility of them defecting to the ruling TRS will be thin,” a senior leader said.

Political analysts said the prospects of TDP candidates winning the municipal elections are thin.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand may become the first state in the country to use drones for conducting a census on crocodiles and gharials , said forest officials on Monday. The last census of the two reptile species in the state was conducted around 11 years ago. Then, a manual count was undertaken in which 232 gharials and 123 crocodiles were said to be found. Now, the latest survey will have drones deployed for videography and photography, based on the flow of water in the river. At the same time, photographs will be clicked randomly and analysed by experts .

The survey will commence from Sharda River on the Nepal border to Ganga River in Haridwar. All the four forest circles – Western, Shivalik, Rajaji and Corbett Tiger Reserve — have a significant population of these two species of reptiles.

According to Parag Madhukar Dhakate, the head of Uttarakhand Forest Drone Force (UFDF), the estimation will begin in January end and the entire survey will be completed within 10 days.

In 2008, around 123 crocodiles and 231 gharials were found spanning an area of 6,370 sq km, though that count did not cover the entire state. The first pilot drone survey was conducted back in 2016, in only Western Circle, where 65 crocodiles were reported.

Experts feel a significant population of crocodiles and gharial will be found around Gaula, Nandhaur, Ramganga and Ganga rivers. A decent population of these two species could be found at Kalagarh and Tumariya dams, the likes of other major water bodies in the state.

Incidentally, drones are frequently used by the experts of the Doon-based Wildlife Institute of India in their advance surveys.

208,['14/01/2020'],Preservation of rights of SL Tamils is the best protection for India,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Nearly two years after his tenure as chief minister of the Northern Provincial Council in Sri Lanka , 80-year-old C V Wigneswaran continues to be drawn into the thick of politics in the island nation. The judge-turned-politician quit the Tamil National Alliance, now a small conglomeration of Tamil parties, which fielded him as the CM candidate in 2013, to form his own political outfit. In an interview with TOI, Wigneswaran expressed apprehensions about President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fashioning a ""Pakistan-like dictatorship"" regime and sought India’s intervention to restore the rights of Tamils. Wigneswaran was in Chennai to take part in a conference organised by the Ulaga Thamizhar Thiruvizha

Q: Tamils feel let down by the previous Maithripala Sirisena regime. Do you think they have hope in the Gotabaya Rajapaksa dispensation?

Sirisena did not look after us (Tamils) though we brought him to office. The Gotabaya government is ready to give us economic benefits but not political ones. They are on record saying the country is Sinhala Buddhist and their agenda is to further that. They are giving economic sops to buy us over, bringing in Sinhalese in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, colonising them and expropriate all the resources in these areas.

Q:Under the circumstances, would the Lankan refugees in Tamil Nadu want to go back home?

Our position is that everyone must return. We are running short of Tamils in the Northern and Eastern provinces. Their lands are being appropriated by the government for the benefit of Sinhalese. Many of the refugees had houses and properties. These were lands that were given on long lease by the Lankan government. Since the refugees had not come back, the government took over, cancelled the lease and gave it to the Sinhalese. So more and more Sinhalese colonies are being created. If the Tamil refugees come back, they may not get the same land but may be given alternate land.

Q: In the wake of the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, you had stated that India should give SL refugees dual citizenship.

There is no provision for dual citizenship between India and Lanka now. But, the governments can work out an agreement. It should be an option. But refugees are the responsibility of the Sri Lankan government and they should return. India can facilitate the infrastructure requirements in Lanka.

Q: So, you are happy with India’s housing programme?

Yes, but we are not happy with India’s political agenda. We want more dynamism on the part of India to help us regain our lost rights.

Q: What is the mood among Tamils there now?

One of dejection, confusion and expectation.

Q: Do you see the Provincial Council elections happening?

I have my doubts if the present government is interested in giving provincial councils power. They may have parliamentary elections and not have the provincial elections. They have not been giving provincial councils the powers under the 13th Amendment of the SL Constitution. They have also taken away the rights of the provinces, which are now controlled by the Centre. Gotabaya wants to make it a centralized government. He has put in retired army personnel in places of importance in administration. There is a possibility that he is working towards a dictatorship of some sort. We may have a Pakistan-like dictatorship soon. So, that’s why I say preservation of the rights of north and eastern Tamils is the best form of protection for India as far as its security is concerned.

Q: How do you see India-Sri Lanka relations?

India must be aware that all statements made by the Sinhalese are not genuine as far as their relationship with India is concerned. If India thinks all the assurances they have been given will be kept, I feel sorry. We have suffered by India’s non-interference in the last stages of the war. But we are part of the Indian culture. India must help preserve our rights, help get us the cooperative federalism that Narendra Modi spoke of when he was in Sri Lanka a few years ago and make sure we have control over our areas.

Q: At the conference were Tamil sentiments being whipped up?

No. No fiery speakers. If that was so, I wouldn’t have come.

Q: What about Indian politicians who used the Tamil Eelam issue for politics here?

Indian politicians should stop using our problems for their election purposes. It is true that we are bound by cultural, linguistic, religious links. But, when making use of our political problems for your political gains, you forget the effect it has on our people. Unnecessary suspicions and enmity is created in the minds of the Sinhalese, who will not accept our genuineness in wanting to be in a federal set-up. They are trying to use this as stepping stones for division in the country.

Q: But leaders like Vaiko and Seeman continue to raise the Tamil Eelam cry. Your comment?

Everybody has a political motive. In 2014, when I came here I told Tamil leaders ""for heaven’s sake when you utter something, think of the consequence it has on the Tamils in Sri Lanka"".

Due to the fear that Northern and Eastern Provinces would break up, Sri Lanka has brought in China into the geopolitical area. But my view is that the security of India is intertwined with the security and political future of the North and East. Unless we are in a position to look after ourselves and not become an appendage of the Sinhalese, you will not have a buffer against the ‘Silk Route’ people. So, North and East must be merged and given federal rights. India can be rest assured that Tamils will be with them under any circumstances and they will not conform to Chinese interference in the matter.

NAGPUR: Even as protests continue against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and National Register of Citizens ( NRC ), immigrants from Pakistan in the city are waiting for the process to acquire citizenship under the amended law to begin.

Nagpur is estimated to have 3,500 Hindu immigrants, mainly from the Sindh province of Pakistan, in addition to a few from Balochistan. They were hoping to get Indian citizenship on a fast track basis, after CAA was put in place.

“The delay has left the community anxious, especially in the wake of massive protests against CAA. Many of us are ready with our documents but have no clue where to submit them,” said one of the immigrants, requesting anonymity.

“It has been a month since the gazette was published, but no format for applying under the amended law has been put out,” said leaders of migrant communities from Pakistan. The unabating protests have heightened their worry and many have been calling up the ministry of home affairs (MHA), where officials have said it may take at least 2-3 months for the process to begin, as it was “still being worked out”.

When asked if the applications could be filed under the existing online format, the answer was that there were chances that an option for CAA may be included in the form, or a separate form may be issued.

At present, citizenship applications are routed through the collector’s office in designated districts like Nagpur. With no change intimated, the old process continues.

The matter is handled by the resident deputy collector Rajendra Khajanji here. The officer told TOI that he had not received any instructions about granting citizenship via the CAA route, and the applications were still being processed through the earlier procedure.

Under this process, the collectorate forwards the applications to the IB for clearance, on the basis of which Indian citizenship is granted, Khajanji said.

“From 2017 to 2018, 137 persons were granted Indian citizenship. Nearly 50 more cases have since been sent to to the intelligence bureau (IB) for clearance. No case was cleared during 2019,” the officer added.

BC Joshi, the director (citizenship) in the MHA told TOI that “work on the format was under way”, which would be uploaded on the website once it is ready. The officer did not give any further details.

Prior to the amendment, applications for citizenship could be filed after living in India for at least 11 years. The minimum requirement has been changed to six years under CAA.

Many stations in Madhya Maharashtra, including Pune, are also reporting early morning haze due to cloud cover and a slight increase in moisture content in the air, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday.Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, said the cities in central Madhya Maharashtra are currently experiencing clouding during the day under the influence of the interaction between the partially moist southwesterly/westerly winds coming from the Arabian Sea and southerlies/southeasterly winds coming from the south of the state. This interaction is causing clouding during early day and night time.“Daytime clouding blocks penetration of solar insulation, causing maximum temperatures to drop. The moisture content in the air is also resulting in early morning haze in these cities, including Pune,” said Kashyapi.On January 9, the day temperature in Shivajinagar was a pleasant 27.4 degrees C, 1.6 degrees C below normal while that in Lohegaon was 27.6 degrees C, around 2 degrees C below normal.Day temperature further dipped to 26.1 degrees C on January 10 at the two locations, being 3-4 degrees C below normal.Similar temperatures (below 30 degrees C mark) have been recorded in the last couple of days with day temperatures on Monday being 29 degrees C for Shivajinagar and 29.5 degrees C for Lohegaon.IMD has forecast day temperatures at less than 30 degrees C till January 19 in Pune with the possibility of haze during the early morning till January 15.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73245273,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-833927,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/interaction-of-winds-brings-hazy-mornings-warmer-nights/articleshow/73235704.cms

PANAJI: The mother of 22-year-old Finnish national Felix Dahl, who was found dead in Canacona in 2015, has written to chief minister Pramod Sawant seeking his intervention in getting justice for her son.

In the letter ,Minna Pirhonen said that lack of investigation into the deaths of tourists by Goa police is interpreted as an attempt to cover up murders to protect the state’s tourist industry and economy. She reminded Sawant that he had said it is the state’s duty to help tourists.

“We, the family of Dahl, ask you to intervene to ensure that CBI’s investigation is made possible without delays and obstructions. That way you can improve Goa as a civilized society with a functional justice system to regain the trust of the foreign tourists,” she wrote.

A trial run of Lakshadeepam at Padmanabhaswamy Temple on Monday

Thiruvananthapuram: The 56-day Murajapam festival at Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple will conclude with Lakshadeepam (lighting of one lakh oil lamps) on Wednesday, coinciding with Makar Sankranti.

Chanting of vedas marked Murajapam, a ritual held once in six years. The mantras from the three Vedas — Rig Veda, Sama Veda and Yajur Veda — are chanted in eight rounds and each round end with Murashiveli, a sacred procession.

On Wednesday, Makarashiveli, the final sacred procession, will be held at 8.30pm, during which priests will carry idols of deities in a decorated vehicle, Garuda Vahanam. Senior members of Travancore royal family will escort the vehicle. The procession, which will be attended by 72 Vedic pandits, will make three rounds of the temple.

The lamps on the temple premises will be lit by 6pm. Revolving oil lamps will be placed at each entrance of the temple. The main illumination will be on Gopuram and Shivelipura of the temple, which are decorated with hundreds of lamps made of soil and brass.

“The lighting is arranged in such a way that the reflection of the temple on Padma Theertham will be a sight to behold. In addition to over one lakh oil lamps, there will be electrical lights on the premises. Labourers from Kanyakumari were brought for the decoration work costing Rs 21 lakh,” said V Ratheesan, executive officer, Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple.

The temple authorities distributed around 15,000 passes to the public and around 5,000 to temple employees, government staff and Travancore royal family members. To avoid late-minute rush, the people who received pass to view Makarashiveli have been asked to enter the temple by 6.30pm.

“Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma will escort the sacred procession for Makarashiveli,” added Ratheeshan.

A specially choreographed programme ‘Radha-Krishna’ by Soorya Krishnamoorthy will mark the grand finale of Sree Padmanabham, the 55-day long art festival organised as part of Lakshadeepam, at 7:15pm on Tuesday.

214,['14/01/2020'],Maintaining blood pH level is the latest trend in the West,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Nagpur: Health problems that make the body too acidic or too alkaline are usually linked to the pH of blood. Maintaining the pH balance of the blood is the latest health trend in western countries. However, Ayurveda already has the concept of ‘Amla-kshar Siddhanta’ which deals with the same phenomenon, said Vaidya (Dr) Prashant Suru, who is one of the very few practitioners of ‘Panchbhautik Chikitsa’, a branch of Ayurveda based on the core philosophy of macrocosm and microcosm.

Dr Suru and some experts of this unique branch of Ayurveda were in the city on Sunday to conduct a daylong seminar organized by Manas Ayurveda. More than 250 practicing doctors and PG students of Ayurveda attended this event.

Dr Suru said that the pH balance is th latest health trend in the US and UK and is expected to reach India soon. Ayurveda has the best solution, he claimed.

“pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. Readings are based around a pH of 7, which is neutral, like pure water. A pH below 7 is acidic while pH higher than 7 is alkaline. Human life requires a tightly-controlled pH level in the blood serum to survive. Ayurveda has the best solutions to get this balance,” said Dr Suru. He shared the nuances of ‘Panchbhautik Chikitsa’ and claimed it has the power to make Ayurveda more specific and result-oriented.

Mukund Sherekar, an expert in Ayurveda, said, “Ayurveda is not only for healing of illnesses. Keeping yourself healthy and fit by maintaining an equilibrium of the five elements is more important. Simple modifications and medicine support can bring about this balance.”

“It’s impossible to avoid health problems as the balance of nature’s five elements around us keeps changing. Ayurveda has some techniques to keep you healthy, even during the changing scenario,” he added.

The organizer of the seminar, Ambarish Ghatate, said that young practitioners were quite impressed with the presentation of the new branch of Ayurveda. Dr Mohan Yende of National Integrated Medical Association said that Nagpur being a medical hub will see more of such academic events promoting Ayurveda in the future.

In an

exclusive interview

, Union HRD minister

Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank

tells TOI’s Ishita Mishra that protests against the

fee hike

in JNU are a ‘non-issue’ and are being held to create controversy. The minister also spoke on the CAA protests saying that they were ‘stoked by opposition parties’, and the abrogation of Article 370 which he said has resulted in the people of Kashmir ‘becoming free and happy.’ Excerpts

The protests against fee hike and violence that took place in JNU have been hogging the national limelight for many days now. As HRD minister, what are you doing to defuse the situation ?

But students say that JNU will be the costliest central university in the country if the fee hike is implemented?

Let us speak about the role of the university’s VC. Students have alleged that he is non-communicative and allowed violence to happen in the varsity. Is your ministry planning to take any action against him?

A sting by a news channel has found that ABVP members were involved in the violence that took place on January 5. What is your reaction to this?

There are major protests going on in the country in the wake of CAA and NRC. What was the need to bring such an Act now?

But why is the government not taking cognisance of the protests of the people? Why the stubbornness to not listen to dissenting voices?

Then why are Muslims thinking that they will be thrown out of India?

During the CAA protests, there have been reports of police excess on students in AMU and Jamia. Can’t students exercise their democratic right to protest?

There is a perception that the government is being run by just two people — PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah. How much independence do you have in running your ministry?

Some people have raised questions regarding the veracity of your PhD degree. What is your reaction to that?

What is your opinion on revocation of Article 370?

Then why such a long internet shutdown in the valley if people are happy?

First of all, let me clarify that fees is not an issue at all in JNU. I had spoken to students regarding the matter during the university’s convocation. I told them that if there is any doubt in their minds regarding the fees, we will work out a solution. Thereafter, a three-member committee was constituted which took the views of all stakeholders. Our ministry’s secretary was also involved in the process. The whole problem regarding the fee arose because UGC stopped giving funds to the university citing it to be an autonomous body. Therefore, it was decided to increase the hostel fee. Mind you, the tuition fee was not touched at all. For a single-seater room, the hostel fee was Rs 10 which was increased to Rs 300 and for a double seater room, it was raised to Rs 600.These are nominal charges for a university in a city like Delhi. This was agreed to by students also in a meeting with the education secretary. So then, why was there a need for protests on fee? I believe that the protests are not for any solution to the fee hike matter but only to create controversy and that, too, a controversy that has now culminated in violence which is very very unfortunate.This is absolutely incorrect. JNU is perhaps the only university in the country where as many as 71% students avail of scholarships. Secondly, it is among the cheapest universities to study in India even after the hike in hostel fees. This is false propaganda.What are the grounds on which action should be taken? The violence in the university took place between two student groups — one who wants to study and the other who doesn’t. This is basically challenging the university administration and disturbing the administrative and academic process. On January 3, masked people created a ruckus in the server room of the university and thrashed those students who simply wanted to study and were registering themselves. Now, my question is that who would do such a thing? Obviously, those who don’t want to study. The university administration controlled the situation but it flared up again on January 5. Now, these masked persons again went on a rampage. Interestingly, when we brought in police to control the violence inside the server room, the students resented, saying that police shouldn’t be in the university. When we removed the police, they cried that police hadn’t come to stop the violence. I want to ask these students whether they want the police in the university or not?Today, even you can go and say that you are an ABVP member and you did such and such thing. Why should anyone believe that? Has any office-bearer of ABVP been found guilty? That is a matter of investigation. Having said that, I believe that action should be taken against all those who were involved in violence and damaging public property. As far as my ministry is concerned, we will not let universities become an adda for politics or violence.The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) hasn’t come randomly and suddenly. It was passed in the last Lok Sabha and by the time it came to Rajya Sabha, the LS was dissolved which is why it was halted for a while. I fail to understand why people are shocked that we brought CAA and NRC. It was in our manifesto. We had promised to do it and people are happy that BJP is the only party that fulfils its poll manifesto promises. CAA is an Act to give citizenship to those who have faced discrimination and violence in other countries in the name of religion. No one is being thrown out of the country, no one is losing his/her citizenship and we have made this clear multiple times.When we know what we are doing is right and for welfare of people, why should we not stick to it? BJP is the only party that is taking tough decisions that are good for the country. Congress has made a huge mistake by allowing India’s division and now the second mistake Congress and its like-minded parties are doing is misleading people on CAA.No Muslim is worried. Only Congress is worried. The opposition is doing politics on this matter by misleading people, that’s all. This Act is about giving citizenship to people and is not meant to take away people’s citizenship.I will urge the students that they should not get misled on CAA and NRC. Universities are for education, not for politics. We want our educational institutions to secure global rankings and for good atmosphere to prevail in our universities. JNU for instance is a top-ranking institution, one of the finest in the country and I will not let people sully its reputation.People who say so don’t know what they are talking about. If a suggestion from the PM is good, why shouldn’t we take it? What is wrong in that? We at the HRD ministry are working 24 hours in a day for the interest of the nation and have full freedom from the Prime Minister to work.I don’t want to comment on this. I just want to say that there are around 15 scholars across the country who are doing PhD on my works and I don’t feel I need to answer to people who question my degree.People could never think that Article 370 could be revoked. The country had two symbols and two sets of laws for far too long. This was the first time a government did what was unexpected and people of Kashmir for the first time felt that they have attained freedom. The people are happy with the freedom they have got.If people would have been unhappy, they would have protested — they don’t need internet for this.

216,['14/01/2020'],Maharashtra: Robber’s transgender turn foxes cops too; he’s a man,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Representative image

PUNE: Police on Monday said the person arrested for robbing a college student of her gold ring and a woman scooterist of Rs5,000 was a man and not a transgender .

Sudhakar Madhukar Sawant (22), who is originally from Buldhana and living in Hadapsar, was arrested on Saturday.

Senior inspector of the Chatushrungi police station Anil Shewale said, “Physical examination revealed that Sawant was a man. He used to seek alms and rob people by posing as a transgender. He would wear sari and use cosmetics to dress and look like a transgender.”

Crime branch officials had arrested Sawant for robbing the college student on Senapati Bapat Road. The complainant studied in a college in Lavale and stayed in the hostel operated by the institute.

On Saturday afternoon, she and her friends were about to enter a mall when two persons, who liked like transgenders, approached her for alms. As she opened her purse, one of them grabbed her arm and the other snatched the ring from her finger. The duo then fled the spot.

As the student approached the police, two constables rushed to the crime spot and started checking the area for clues. They soon traced the duo to Hadapsar and recovered the ring.

The police also found some cash on Sawant. During the course of investigations, the police got to know that Sawant had also robbed a woman scooterist (34) near the Chatushrungi temple on January 4. Sawant had first abused the woman and subsequently snatched her purse containing Rs5,000. The police then filed another robbery case against him.

Shewale said, “Considering Sawant’s ways of dressing and voice, we had also thought that he was a transgender. But the physical examinations revealed that Sawant was a man. Sawant is involved in more robberies with his accomplices”.

Sub-inspector Rakesh Sarade said, “Sawant used to act as ‘bahurupi’ (cosplayer), but did not have any certificate in the art form. While acting in some plays, he had performed the roles of woman characters. This is how he learnt how to wear a sari and use cosmetics.”

He added, “Sawant shifted to Pune four years ago in search of a job. After failing to get a job, he started begging on the streets under the guise of a transgender person. He subsequently started robbing people.”

217,['14/01/2020'],"5 yrs on, 3 engg officials penalised over shopping complex project","This story is from January 14, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Five years after a proposed shopping complex project at Kuravankonam ran into trouble over allegations of graft, the local self government department ( LSGD ) has taken disciplinary action against three officials who were formerly employed in the engineering wing of city corporation when the project was being executed.

LSGD took action based on a probe report by vigilance and anti-corruption bureau and a report by chief engineer of LSGD that three officials who had been working as assistant engineer, assistant executive engineer and overseer made lapses in recording measurements during construction of piles and that the measurements were not accurate. LSGD has barred annual increment of the officials for two years.

The shopping complex, which was launched as a dream project of the corporation in 2015, erupted into controversy as the payment of contractor who did piling was delayed citing variations in measurements. As per the project, piling was recommended to provide a sturdy underground base for the foundation owing to poor strength of the soil. As per the tender, the work had to be completed at Rs 68 lakh. The soil test recommended 9.2 metres as the depth, which could vary up to 11 metres. A total of 83 piles were made and 12 had to be done after that. However, issue arose when the contractor submitted bills to the tune of Rs 80 lakh for the project, citing that use of a different technology to reduce the noise resulted in escalation of costs.

Later, the contractor also came out with allegations against three engineering officials saying his payment was delayed after he had refused to pay them bribe. The issue had then caused rift in the council with former mayor refusing to accept the recommendation by then heads of standing committees to remove the engineers associated with the project and to conduct an internal enquiry. Syam Kumar, the former ward councillor of Kuravankonam and former chairman of tax appeal standing committee, had even threatened to quit owing to mayor’s indifference to the demands of heads of standing committees.

An inspection by Kerala engineering research institute (KERI) had revealed that there were variations in depth of piles and that doubts were raised regarding composition of concrete.

VACB began probe into the irregularities following a complaint received by the department. The probe found out that the project, which received a technical sanction of Rs 68 lakh, furnished bills of Rs 69.56 lakh for the construction of 83 piles and that the estimate had to be revised to Rs 81.13 lakh.

Some people in China have never heard of Goa, says a TTAG member

PANAJI: Goa tourism, which has not met much success in discovering a new tourist market in the past one decade, is eyeing China, which is a huge outbound market.

During its recent participation in the Chengdu International tourism expo, the Goa delegation discovered the state stands a chance to win a new market. It is planning to take up promotional activities in China after government approval. “We are considering it a potential new market,” said secretary, tourism, J Ashok Kumar. He added that the modalities have not been worked out yet.

Savio Messias, president, travel and tourism association of Goa (TTAG), who was part of the delegation, said, “While we will see how to to lure the Chinese visitors touring the Golden triangle (New Delhi, Agra and Jaipur) to the land of sun, sand and sea, others, who have never heard of India and Goa, can also be targeted,” he said.

Though India has been offering the e-visa option to Chinese travelers, the number of tourists from China has not increased on expected lines.

In 2018, 2.5 lakh Chinese tourists visited India. However, the state tourism department’s website has no record of Chinese visitors to Goa. Messias said during the tourism expo in Chengdu, they realised that there are Chinese people who are not aware of the existence of Goa. “It is sad that India has not figured in the list of top ten destinations of the world for China, while a small country like the Maldives and a country like New Zealand, which is not a great travel destination, have found favour with Chinese travelers,” he said.

Chinese travelers visit Sri Lanka and Kerala, Messias said, and this means Goa also stands a chance at attracting them. China’s tourism market has been growing significantly, since the last decade, he added. Goa tourism will have to explore new markets if it wants to remain relevant as an international tourist destination. With the number of tourists from Russia and the UK dwindling year on year, Goa has not been able to make significant headway in holding the attention of European travelers, though a charter from Poland was restarted this season.

A total of 13 houses and 26 vehicles were set ablaze in a clash between two communities in Bhainsa on Sunday

HYDERABAD: The police recommended for suspension of internet services due to the rumour-mongering among the members of both the communities after clashes between them in Bhainsa on Sunday.

Local rumours were spread by some miscreants ranging from killings to vandalising religious places. Due to these rumours, the situation was becoming worse as the already charged-up members of both the communities were getting more agitated and marching to the roads to intensify the violence.

On the recommendation of Telangana police, all service providers suspended internet services and sent a message to all the mobile phone users through a message.

Internet services are suspended in the following districts - Adilabad, Nirmal, Manchiryal and Asifabad districts, which were part of erstwhile united Adilabad district.

“Data alert: Dear customer, as per the government instruction, internet services have been temporarily stopped in your area,” is the message mobile phone service providers sent to a phone user. The decision to suspend internet services was taken to avoid spread of rumours.

Sources in Telangana police said that the situation had been volatile in Bhainsa, an area which is considered by police as very sensitive ever since the notification for municipal elections was announced.

Since most of the forces were stationed at Nirmal as preparations for election bandobast duties, it took some time for the police to react to the situation with full force.

221,['14/01/2020'],"With plastic kites banned, cloth and paper ones fly high","This story is from January 14, 2020

NAGPUR: Flying vibrant and colourful kites with your family or buddies under the morning sun while you chill out on a rooftop is among the chief pleasures of Makar Sankranti . The joy of snapping others’ kites in the air is unmatched and the euphoria a common sight on this festival of kites in the city.

This year it is being celebrated on January 15. Apart from flying kites, on this day Til-Gul (sweets made of sesame seeds and jaggery ) are also exchanged.

Markets are flooded with colourful kites catching fancy of many. As plastic kites are banned, apart from the traditional paper ones, kites made of cloth are also becoming popular. These kites come in different sizes and rates vary from Rs 2 to Rs 150.

Pratik Borkar, a kite seller from the city, has displayed a variety of kites in his shop for upcoming festival. “We have over 10-15 types of kites in our shop. Right from Rs 2 to the most expensive one, all are paper-made,” he said. About the most popular type, he added, “Goladar’ is the most sold kite in my shop. Children also purchase small kites in different shapes.”

From ‘Delta’ kites which are triangular shaped to ‘diamond’ one, which are easily recognizable from the sky, all are very popular. Himanshu Shahu from Mahesh Patang Store expressed his views about the ban on plastic kites, “Initially, we did order plastic kites, as they are cheaper and are sold in bulk. But afterwards, I returned the complete stock.”

Cloth kites are the new trend. They are made of material used for making parachutes. “People are buying cloth kites, which are available in different shapes and vibrant colours. The most expensive one in my shop is for Rs 150,” Shahu added.

Apart from the traditional, multi-colour kites, kites with printed faces of Bollywood stars and cartoon characters are liked by the children. Jitender Shahu from Jitendra Patang store said, “There is a wide variety of kites in the market. I have kept all the colourful and printed ones in my shop and we are not selling any plastic ones.”

Sellers expressed their concern about plastic kites and are backing the decision to ban them. Not only at the prominent markets, but everywhere only paper kites are being sold even if that means selling less. “We are selling paper kites at the cost of plastic ones. Flying kites will always be done. Every year people come to our shops and get their favourite kites,” said Praful Kamdi, a kite seller.

Many people make kites at home using paper. The exercise usually involves the whole family and is a great way to bond.

222,['14/01/2020'],"Minor cyclist’s death: Culvert gets railing, father awaits action on ‘negligent babus’","This story is from January 14, 2020

Bhopal: Two days after a 12-year-old bicycle-borne Varun died in a freak accident after falling in Upper Lake from a culvert near Judicial Academy in Ratibad area, the administration on Monday afternoon fixed new railing rods on the culvert.

But the devastated family feels this step should have been taken earlier. The deceased boy’s family — in a state of shock after the incident — said that the boy could have survived had there been railing on the culvert.

His father burst into tears and said that he lost his child due to negligence of the officials responsible for maintaining the road. Appropriate action should be taken against them, he said.

An eerie silence prevailed in Sewania Goud village where Varun resided with his family. Deceased Varun Gour, 12, son of Rajendra Gour, was a student of class 6 at a private school. He was the youngest among four siblings. Rajendra, who works as a mason, told TOI that Varun was a good student. He loved his bicycle and did many modifications to it on his own. Varun and his elder sister Lucky joined karate classes at SAI stadium merely five days before the incident. Siblings, along with three other friends, including Preet Dhangar, 13, used to walk to SAI stadium in the morning.

Lucky told TOI that on the day the incident took place, it was too cold, so she skipped the karate class. Only Varun and Preet went to the stadium on their bicycles. While returning, when Varun reached the culvert near Goragaon, his cycle bumped and he fell into the Upper Lake along with his cycle. Preet tried to pull up Varun from the culvert twice but failed. As Varun was drowning, he called for help, but by the time the boy was fished out by a passerby, Arvind Maran, it was too late .

Rajendra said that he was sleeping when the incident took place. Preet called on Varun’s eldest sister’s phone and informed her about the incident. As the girl had left home for college, she informed Varun’s mother about it. As soon as she heard the news, she ran towards the culvert on foot. By that time Arvind Maran had fished out Varun. Together they rushed the boy to a hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.

Varun’s grandfather Mohan Singh Gour, who resides in Salaiya Silvani, couldn’t control himself and burst into tears. Continuously staring at Varun’s bicycle which was fished out from the lake on Monday, he said that he lost everything with Varun’s sudden death.

Ramesh Pokhriyal

NEW DELHI: Union human resource development minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Monday said that the fee-related matter of JNU had been sorted out and continuation of agitation by students was not justified.

A press statement released by the ministry stated that the fee-related matter had been sorted following several rounds of discussions with representatives of JNU students and teachers. The ministry had earlier set up a high-powered committee following an assurance by Pokhriyal to look into the matter.

Taking into consideration the spirit of recommendations of the HPC, various meetings were held by the HRD secretary with representatives of students/teachers and JNU administration on December 10 and 11, 2019, and certain mutually agreeable agreements were arrived at. JNU later issued a statement saying that the students were not being asked to bear the cost of service and utility charges proposed for the winter session, which was their basic demand. The revised hostel room charges, however, will remain applicable with 50% concession for BPL students, it added then.

The ministry said that of the 8,600 students, more than 5,000 have already registered for the winter session. It appealed to the students to call off their agitation.

Representative image

CHANDIGARH: Struggling to spread the cover of its de-addiction programme, the Punjab health department is sitting over its two-month-old decision to allow private centres with outpatient facility to dispense drugs covered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.

To widen the availability of treatment at affordable rates, the health department in November divided de-addiction centres for treatment of substance-use disorder into two categories — one with indoor facility, and the other without an indoor facility. This allowed facilities without indoor facility to dispense buprenorphine , which, at present, is dispensed by private centres with indoor facility and government-run out-patient opioid-assisted treatment (OOAT) clinics.

Rules were framed and later communicated to civil surgeons in all districts. However, the department has not started accepting applications for allowing such centres to register. The delay has led to resentment among psychiatrists, who have spent time and money to fulfil norms in the rules.

Dr Satish Thapar, a Bathinda-based psychiatrist, is among many doctors who, in anticipation of implementation of new rules, invested in infrastructure. “I rented a space and have so far spent Rs 4 lakh,” said Dr Thapar. “I am not sure what is going to happen and what is holding the government back.”

As per rules, centres must have one full-time psychiatrist and counseller, and they must have a separate room for the doctor and dispensing with storage facility. Other infrastructural requirements include one room for counselling patients, OPD with a capcity of more than 50 patients per day, a waiting area with provision of drinking water and a rest room. There should be adequate space for storage of equipment and medicines as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.

Association of Psychiatrists (AOP) Punjab president Dr Rupinder Kapur expressed surprise over the delay behind a patient-friendly step taken by the government. She said it was appreciated, but should be implemented at the earliest. “The department, for some unforeseen circumstances, is dragging its feet on starting OPD clinics’ registration under OOAT programme. It has been almost two months since the minutes of meeting and rules were circulated by the department,” said Dr Kapur.

Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said they were reworking the modalities to ensure that there was no misuse of controlled drugs. “The new rules will be implemented only after reworking the modalities,” said Sidhu.

VADODARA: The number of vehicles on the roads of Banyan City have increased over the years, but the number of road accidents have consistently dropped in the last five years.

The figures released by the traffic branch of city police suggest that the number of road accidents including the fatal ones have come down by 41% since 2015.

Figures looked really promising in accidents where the victims suffered only minor injuries. However, the number of accidents where the victims were grievously injured didn’t register much improvement.

While the fall in number of road accidents may bring some cheer, the death of 969 people during the same period raises a serious alarm.

“The drop in the numbers is a result of our constant efforts to bring down the number of road accidents in the city,” said a police official. “After studying the spots where repeated road accidents had been taking place, we held traffic drives at those spots so that the situation can improve,” the police official added.

Senior police officials said that the support from industrial organizations, schools, universities and other institutions for conducting traffic drives also contributed to the efforts. “Over the years commuters’ habits have changed. Even in absence of traffic police at the junctions, people wait at the red lights and wear helmets and seat belts obediently,” said Amita Vanani, assistant commissioner of police (traffic).

The high number of spot collection of fines from those driving on wrong sides, over-speeding, jumping red lights have also seem to have worked in decreasing the number of accidents. Traffic police penalized 79,645 commuters for driving on wrong side, over-speeding and jumping red light and collected a fine of Rs 1.1 crore in 2019 alone.

HYDERABAD: After nearly five months, chief ministers of Telangana and AP — K Chandrasekhar Rao and YS Jaganmohan Reddy — met at Pragati Bhavan on Monday and held a marathon six-hour meeting.

Sources said among other things, they also discussed national issues. Citizenship Amendment Act, NRC, NPR, river inter-linking, three capitals of AP and cash-for-vote scam came up for discussion. While the chief ministers decided to sail together on key issues, highly-placed sources said they also discussed about the strategy to be adopted with the BJP-led NDA government. Many of the non-BJP governments have already opposed CAA and NPR.

The AP government had announced that it would not implement NRC, while the Telangana government has not officially come out with its stand on NRC. The YSRC government had voted in favour of CAA in Parliament, but later announced that it would not support NRC. On the other hand, TRS had voted against CAA and is facing pressure from AIMIM to oppose NRC and NPR.

Sources said the chief ministers are believed to have felt that it would be better to take decisions together keeping in mind interests of both the states. They had worked closely on resolving bifurcation issues soon after Jagan took over as CM.

Sources said Jagan also briefed KCR on three capitals issue and reason behind his decision. He is believed to have told KCR that ongoing agitations on the capitals’ row were sponsored by TDP. The chief ministers also discussed the cash-for-vote case pending in Telangana. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu and others are facing charges for his alleged role in the case.

According to an official press release by the chief minister’s office, both the chief ministers decided to adopt a give and take policy in all the matters pertaining to both the states for the benefit of people. They resolved to supply Godavari water to the Krishna river basin. The CMs also discussed about Schedule IX and X of the AP Reorganisation Act and spoke to respective chief secretaries over phone and asked them to hold a meeting at the earliest.

“During the six-hour long discussions, the CMs discussed national issues, states’ and local political situation. There was a lengthy discussion on diversion of Godavari water to Krishna basin,” the press release said.

CHANDIGARH: Claiming to be reeling under financial crunch, the Punjab Unaided Colleges Association (Puca) has urged the Union government to release Rs 1,400 crore of the post-matric scholarship (PMS) scheme pending since 2015. There are about 16,000 unaided colleges in Punjab, in which about 3 lakh students belonging to marginalised community are studying, according to Puca .

A Puca delegation met Union minister of state for commerce and industry Som Prakash, who is the MP from Hoshiarpur . Puca president Anshu Kataria said Rs 415.60 crore of PMS for 2016-17, Rs 538 cr for 2017-18, and Rs 437.19cr for 2018-19 were due till now. “This totals to around Rs 1,400 crore, which is due towards the central government. This has created a financial crunch in colleges of Punjab,” he said.

The minister assured the delegation that he would discuss this matter with Union minister for social justice and empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot and get the pending amount released as soon as possible.

Former MP Sher Singh Ghubaya, who was part of the delegation, said the Centre had stated that scheme was under 60:40 sharing pattern while the Punjab government had rejected the idea. “This confusion may adversely affect the career of the students as well as the colleges,” Ghubaya said.

CM Amarinder Singh

CHANDIGARH: Unemployed youth who undergo skill development training will also be given monthly allowance of Rs 1,000. Under the ‘Mera Kamm, Mera Maan’, a skilling and employment initiative of the Punjab government, provision has been made for giving monthly financial support, albeit with riders.

To help unemployed youth enhance their skills to meet the market requirements, the Punjab government will facilitate them in enrolling in government-run industrial training institutes (IITs), polytechnic colleges and Punjab skill development training centres for free in their chosen field . The department of employment generation and training has prepared a draft of the scheme and circulated to all the departments for feedback.

As per the laid down condition, the allowance will be paid only for those months for which the candidate has cumulative attendance of at least 80% and passed the regular periodic exams. The allowance of those failing to meet the condition will be stopped and will resume only after both the conditions are fulfilled by the candidate. The amount will be directly deposited in the bank account of the beneficiary.

Those interested in availing the benefit of the scheme will have to fulfil the conditions required for getting admission in these institutes against vacant seats. Only one member of a family will be entitled to avail the benefit of the scheme at a given time.

The district bureaus of employment and enterprise (DBEE) have been entrusted with responsibility of registering interested applicants and then coordinate with the institutes to facilitate their admissions for skilling. On successful completion of the training, DBEEs will also help the beneficiaries get employment.

Employment generation and training secretary Rahul Tewari said the scheme would be first rolled out on a pilot basis for construction workers and their wards. “In phased manner, the government will roll out the scheme for other sections of society too,” he added.

Punjab is grappling with a high rate of unemployment and creating job avenues was a major Congress poll promise in the 2017 assembly elections. The poor skill level of the job seekers in the state has been highlighted by industry. A large number of jobs in the five job fairs organised by the government so far have also gone abegging for the same reasons, posing a challenge to ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’, a flagship scheme of the government.

230,['14/01/2020'],Current troubles threatening Indian finances: Richard Thaler,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Kolkata: Current troubles in India are “threatening the country’s economy”, though they were not unique to India, said Nobel laureate and behavioural economist Richard H Thaler at IIM Calcutta on Monday. Delivering the Amitava Bose Memorial Lecture at the premier management institute, Thaler said protests were happening worldwide and countries should figure out how to deal with them since they were pulling the respective economies back. “But I don’t pretend to know the answer,” said the economics Nobel winner of 2017.

“Protests are happening everywhere. Chile is affected and San Diego is suffering in terms of tourism. France has been affected and so has been India,” said the professor of behavioural science and economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. We are living in the riskiest of times, he added. “Brexit was madness. Democracy is fragile right now. As an investor, I am nervous. But I don’t know what to do. I guess we can only hope for the best,” said Thaler, while answering a question at the end of his lecture.

In his lecture titled “Doing economics in the 21st century: When economists need to stop and think twice”, Thaler pointed out that economic theories and models were often based on the incorrect assumption that people acted optimally in given situations. “Economists need to first examine who they are studying and what expertise they have. How often do their subjects engage in the activity being studied. And whether they are actually optimizing the benefits at their disposal or going for what they find is good enough for them,” said Thaler.

To stress his point, the Nobel laureate cited the instance of cardiac patients in USA, not more than 35% of whom take medicines to prevent a heart attack. “It’s not known what makes them do it. Do they believe they know better than their doctors? Or, is it because they can’t find time to take medicines? Similarly, firms, too, often don’t optimize their operations. But badly run firms can last decades. So, every economic paper should be as behavioural as it can be,” observed Thaler.

He said ‘nudges’ were required to help people choose the best possible option but they may or may not work. “The best example of a nudge is the Google map which gives you the shortest possible route from one place to another. It helps you to get there but can’t force you to accept its suggestion,” he said.

Was immigration responsible for slowing down economies? Not really, felt Thaler. “The US economy is chugging along nicely even as president Trump is lambasting immigrants. The economy of Chile is the strongest in South America despite immigration being an issue there,” he said.

232,['14/01/2020'],Dissident Akalis to rally in poll-bound Delhi this Saturday,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Shiromani Akali Dal president, Sukhbir Singh Badal

AMRITSAR: To mobilise inactive Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders and strengthen their support base, dissident Akali veterans who have already sounded a bugle against the party leadership, particularly the Badal family, are set to show their strength by holding a rally in poll-bound Delhi on January 18.

The pretext is to celebrate the 99th foundation anniversary of SAD, which was formed in 1920. The move comes at a time when senior Akali leadership is camping in Delhi to persuade its Punjab ally, BJP, for seat sharing in Delhi. To portray that the present leadership of SAD had deviated from the principles of the party’s foundation, the organisers of Delhi event are describing themselves as ‘Samuh Akali Parivar (whole of Akali family)’, as it would include various factions of SAD.

The function has been named Safar-e-Akali Dal (journey of Akali Dal). “Time has come when we have to bring more Taksali leaders, who have been ignored and living in oblivion, to the fore for the resurrection of SAD,” president of religio-political outfit Jag Asra Guru Ott (JAGO). Manjit Singh GK, a former ally of Badals, told TOI on Monday.

During the 2015 Delhi assembly elections, SAD and BJP were alliance partners with the former contesting on four seats on its own symbol and two on BJP’s symbol.

Manjit, who is also the former president of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), claimed that the January 18 function would set the course for rejuvenation of the old SAD. Sewa Singh Sekhwan , secretary general of SAD (Taksali), which is one of the invitees to the January 18 function, said, “Reports of SAD alliance with BJP in Delhi are one-sided. BJP is yet to make its position clear and will weigh the political leverage it will have after forging ties with SAD for the Delhi polls or the alliance would prove to be a burden.”

When asked about the progress about discussions with BJP over seat sharing in Delhi, party spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema expressed ignorance. He said the party’s in-charge of political affairs for Delhi, Balwinder Singh Bhunder, was negotiating with the saffron party.

Bhunder couldn’t be contacted for comment. Sources informed that dissident Akalis were also in a bid to rope in some prominent BJP face during their January 18 function in Delhi. However, the same couldn’t be confirmed.

BATHINDA: The Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), like last year, have decided not to hold any political conference on the occasion of Maghi in Muktsar, but the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is going ahead with its function on Tuesday, with a last-minute change in venue due to bad weather.

The party was pitching its tent and stage at the open ground on Malout bypass when rain lashed the region on Monday. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal , who took stock of preparations, decided to shift the venue to a resort on Malout Road, after obtaining clearance from the police, said a party spokesperson.

Muktsar SAD MLA Kanwarjit Singh Barkandi said the stage which was being set up for the rally was wet and the party decided to change the venue as more rain was predicted. “Acting on the directions of party president, we decided to shift the venue to a marriage palace,” he said.

A party functionary, who did not wish to be named, said the gathering would be important as it would be the first political conference of SAD without former leader of party in assembly Parminder Singh Dhindsa and his father, Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa . “It will be interesting to see how we mobilise workers and what do leaders speak at the rally,” said the functionary.

Union minister Harsimrat Badal already set the tone for the rally on Monday, attacking Parminder. ""If the SAD is a group of sycophants, Parminder must make it clear whether he too was a sycophant. Till recently, he was very much with us and singing paeans to us,” she said.

VADODARA: Almost four decades after they ransacked a ‘bhajiya’ stall and robbed the owner of Rs 250, three persons were acquitted by a local court as the complainant himself turned hostile during the trial.

The court of additional chief judicial magistrate acquitted Jayanti Parmar, Dileep Parmar and Mohan Parmar after stall owner Rajendra Thakor retracted from his allegations last week.

It was in November 1981 that the trio had gone to his ‘bhajia’ stall in Bakrawadi locality in Navapura and asked him to give food on credit. When Thakor refused, the three got agitated and started hurling expletives at him. They allegedly ransacked his stall and robbed his daily cash collection. Following a complaint lodged by Thakor, city police station had arrested them and they were released on bail later. The chargesheet was filed within a month.

During the trial, none of the three appeared in the court despite repeated summons. Therefore, it was decided to go ahead with the trial without them.

The public prosecutor submitted the complaint and the statements of material witnesses as the key evidence in the case. The court considered the evidence against the trio, but when it came to examination of Thakor, the prosecution’s case collapsed.

When the public prosecutor examined Thakor, he did not support the case. Thakor flatly denied that the three had ransacked his stall and abusive language. He also refuted his own allegations of the trio robbing him of Rs 250.

The court stated that as the complainant himself admitted that no such incident took place and the accused too remained away from trial, the case has not been proven.

BENGALURU: The high court on Monday asked the government to explain private parties’ role in maintaining and developing Bengaluru’s lakes.

The court was hearing a batch of petitions on the state of water bodies in the city.

Environmentalist Leo Saldanha said in a newspaper advertisement last month, the chief minister had requested corporates to take up maintenance and development of lakes as part of their corporate social responsibilities. This amounted to privatisation, he argued, but a division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka said it does not seem to be so.

The court directed the government and BBMP to extend logistical support (except money) to the Environment Support Group (ESG), which is undertaking a survey of waterbird habitats in the city along with the Birdwatchers’ Field Club.

To properly assess the extent of shrinking of lakes/wetlands across the state, the court sought a map prepared by Survey of India in 1972, data available with Karnataka State Remote Sensing Applications Centre and reports submitted by the Lake Development Authority, which is now merged with the minor irrigation department.

Punjab hopes to end manual scavenging with the move

CHANDIGARH: To put an end to manual scavenging , the Punjab water supply and sanitation department has decided to employ robots for cleaning sewerage in the state.

Water supply and sanitation minister Razia Sultana said the project would be started from Muktsar Sahib on the auspicious occasion of Maghi on Tuesday. Punjab would now become the seventh state in the country to adopt this technique, with Muktsar becoming the first district in state. Two machines worth Rs 90 lakh each would bring a much-needed upgrade in this mammoth and difficult task, said Sultana.

The machines are carbon-bodied robots which are waterproof and equipped with sensors to ascertain toxic gases inside pipes. “These have been designed as per human needs and with a view to assist our workers and are easy to operate,” she said.

In the first phase, the hi-tech robotic machine, ‘Bandikooto’, designed by Jenrobotics Company of Kerala would commence human-free sewerage cleaning in Muktsar Sahib, which would save employees from dangers of grave problems caused by physical cleaning of sewerages and by exposure from toxic gases. The use of technology would also speed up cleaning, she said.

CHANDIGARH: Posters declaring BJP MP from Gurdaspur Sunny Deol ‘missing’ have been put up at various places in Pathankot district , including the railway station. Posters read ‘Gumshuda ki talash MP Sunny Deol’.

In response to these posters, Deol said in a video message on his Twitter handle on Monday that it was the act of his rivals. “I have learnt that my rivals are talking some senseless things about me,” said Deol. Wishing people, a Happy Lohri, the MP promised his voters to bring some big projects to the Gurdaspur constituency. Deol said in the video that the traffic issue in Pathankot city would be addressed soon through the narrow-gauge elevated project as the central government had sanctioned funds for it.

He said, “I have been able to do such things because of the strength of faith you reposed in me. I will bring some big projects in the future because your faith is my strength.”

Reacting, Congress MP from Anandpur Sahib Manish Tewari said on Twitter: “Not surprising same thing happened to his father Dharmendra in Bikaner. Gurdaspur missed the chance of a good man @sunilkjakhar representing them again. Would have added to @INCIndia’s strength in Parliament.”

The actor had appointed a writer Gurpreet Singh Palheri as his representative to “attend meetings and follow important matters” in July last year, leading to sharp criticism from various quarters.

Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa

CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akai Dal (SAD) on Monday said Congress ministers going out of the way to help suspended Akali leaders Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and his MLA son, Parminder Singh Dhindsa , proved that they were being used as pawns by chief minister Amarinder Singh .

The SAD said it showed Congress’s attempt to weaken the Panthic party. SAD senior vice-president Balwinder Singh Bhunder and general secretary Prem Singh Chandumajra said the closeness between the Dhindsas and the CM had become apparent during a recent dinner meeting between them. “Now, with Congress ministers taking on the job of spokespersons for the Dhindsa family, it is clear they are working according to a game plan in collusion with each other,” said the Akali leaders.

They added the Dhindsa faction, which comprised Sukhdev, Parminder and Sukhdev’s son-in-law Tejinderpal Singh Sidhu, was being supported by the Congress with the sole aim of splitting Panthic votes. Bunder and Chandumajra said SAD leaders left the Dhindsa family because of their autocratic nature and inability to make the party win in their area. A day after SAD suspended Sukhdev and Parminder, Punjab ministers on Sunday targeted SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal , claiming that the party had been reduced to “personal fiefdom” of the Badals. The ministers included Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Gurpreet Singh Kangar.

AHMEDABAD: Chinese nylon threads are not only used to fly kites, but also used to snare birds in Nalsarovar — the only Ramsar site in the state. Forest officials have recovered some 60 spools of Chinese threads. These threads were sold for the Uttarayan festival .

Deputy conservator of forest, Nalsarovar, Brijash Chaudhari said that the Chinese thread spools were sold in Shahpur village in Viramgam taluka. Chaudhari said the sale of Chinese thread was already banned by the state government, but in villages on the periphery of the Nalsarovar the thread was used to set bird snares.

Chaudhary said that acting on a tip-off, officials had raided Ronak Mobile shop and recovered the Chinese thread. No arrests were made as there was no one present in the shop at the time of the raid and seizure of the goods. A case has been registered, Chaudhary said.

A senior forest official said the modus operandi was simple. In the night the locals flew around 10 kites together, and one of them rousted out the birds. When the birds took sudden flight at night, they were snared in the kite threads. The injured birds were then eaten or sold.

Forest officials said this is the first time that such a large number of Chinese thread spools have been recovered. This is the third poaching-related case reported from Nalsarovar lake this year. In the earlier two incidents, birds were recovered from the residents.

Thiruvananthapuram: Two cops of Valiyathura police station who reportedly lectured a young woman as to why she should keep off beaches at night while receiving a complaint of moral policing were sent for a seven-day behavioural training course at the police training academy.

Valiyathura police also recorded the arrest of five men who had allegedly harassed and verbally abused the 24-year-old woman and her two friends at Shangumugham beach late on Saturday.

The accused were Nahas, 24, and Suhaib, 26, of Puthuval Puriyadam, Vallakadavu; Mohammed Ali, 27, of Kurisumoodu Vila, Vallakadavu; Anzari, 27, of Manikkavilakom, Poonthura, and Antony, 40, of Kannanthura. Sreelakshmi Arackal, who came to the beach with her two friends, was subjected to moral policing and her Facebook post describing the incident went viral. The post also mentioned the police officers questioning why Sreelakshmi was at the beach at night.

According to Valiyathura station house officer inspector Anil Kumar S, the accused were all identified with visuals submitted by the complainant and were picked up from their residences at around 11pm on Sunday. “A case invoking multiple sections including outraging the modesty of a woman has been registered against the accused. Two officers, ASI Salahuddin who was in charge of GD and civil police officer Suresh Kumar who was on sentry duty have both been sent for a behavioural training for their response to the complainant,” the officer said.

Sreelakshmi said that she is happy that the police acted on the complaint and recording the arrest in such a short span of time. “I was called in to the station to identify the men who were taken into custody and confirmed all five as those who were involved in the moral policing at the beach. Eventhough I am not sure, I think there were two more men in the group of people who harassed us. But it is reassuring to know that the arrests were made without much delay,” she said.

Women and child development department secretary Biju Prabhakar praised the boldness showed by Sreelakshmi in handling the situation and filing a complaint at the police station. “Women in our society should take a leaf out of the boldness shown by Sreelakshmi and react like this against such atrocities. Parents of girls living in close proximity to the locations of the accused should think twice before marrying their daughters to men like them. Night week is still being organised across parts of the state at least once in a week and this will be expanded statewide by March 8. More women should come out at nights without fear like Sreelakshmi which will help nab more of such perverts and help reclaim freedom for women in public spaces,” Prabhakar said in a post he shared on Facebook.

NAGPUR: Seven persons , including two couples, have been booked for their alleged role in duping a retired employee of Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), Pradeep Bose, to the tune of Rs42.72 lakh over seven years.

The persons named in the First Information Report (FIR) have been identified as advocate Dhananjay Dhodarkar, his wife Sonali, Arun Shrivastav, Jayashree Bagul (wife of a senior police inspector), Dinesh Madavi, his wife Sumitra, and Ravindra Govindwar. They have been slapped with charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust, and forgery among others.

Police said Bose had approached Shrivastav of Royal Developers to purchase an apartment. Shrivastav had asked Bose to approach his legal adviser Dhodarkar. It was Dhodarkar who asked Bose to book an apartment at a scheme of Royal Developers at Kachipura. It’s learnt that Bose was later directed by Dhodarkar to buy an apartment at Tilak Nagar instead of Kachipura since that scheme was not working out.

Dhodarkar, trying to convince Bose, had also said that he was also a member along with his wife Sonali and others including the Madavi couple at the Tilak Nagar scheme. Bose was made to cough up substantial amount in cash and cheque, promising him that the scheme would soon start and the apartment would be handed over to him.

Dhodarkar and others also prepared fake documents to collect cash from Bose. It was after spending considerable amount that Bose realized that he was being cheated since the documents were fake and questionable. He approached Ambazari police station where an offence was registered.

Police take stock after two groups clashed in Bhainsa in Nirmal late on Sunday night

HYDERABAD: Nineteen people, including eight police officers, were injured after two groups clashed late on Sunday night in the communally sensitive Bhainsa town in Telangana ’s Nirmal district . The rioting was triggered after some residents clashed with youths revving up their bikes in the middle of the night. It soon led to widespread violence in which 13 houses and 26 vehicles were torched.

The violence did not abate on Monday, especially at Korbagalli and surrounding areas, believed to be the epicentre of the violence. Police lathi-charged the rioters at least half-a-dozen times to stop the sporadic clashes on Monday afternoon. As many as 60 people were taken into custody till late evening on Monday. Officials added that internet services were suspended across Nirmal, Adilabad, Mancherial and Asifabad districts as wild rumours on social media kept the embers burning.

“Eleven civilians and eight policemen were injured in the clashes and stone-pelting. We have registered six FIRs for different offences. The situation is now under control and the vigil will continue,” inspector general of police Nagi Reddy, who is in Nirmal, told TOI on Monday evening.

It all started around 9.45 pm on Sunday when some residents objected to a bunch of young men riding bikes without silencers at Korbagalli area. The argument led to a scuffle which resulted in two groups coming face to face. Cops claim that the situation was about to de-escalate and the groups decided to stand down when an unidentified person threw a stone at one of the groups, triggering heavy stone pelting at around 10.30 pm. Pitched battles continued for nearly three hours, according to the police.

Senior officials said that by the time the police reached the spot, the situation was serious with both sides refusing to relent. SP C Shashidhar Raju also rushed to stop the stone-pelting. Police teams from districts adjoining Nirmal too were rushed to the town with DGP M Mahendar Reddy monitoring the situation from Hyderabad. Section 144 of CrPC was declared from Monday till Wednesday.

AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Twitter called the incident “targeted violence” and demanded that “every miscreant is immediately brought to justice, so that criminals think twice before participating in such activity. Those who have had to face loss of property must be compensated immediately. Every complaint must be registered along with FIRs,” he tweeted.

The Telangana BJP, in a statement, demanded that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao make a statement on the violence and also sought a judicial enquiry.

Bhainsa had seen its worse communal clashes in 2008 in which six people died. The violence had started after a religious procession was taken out in the town.

People of all ages were seen thronging the multi-coloured kite stalls located in every nook and cranny of the city getting armed for the battle of the skies on Tuesday.

Colourful kites and their enthusiasts can’t wait to adorn the sky in vibrant hue on Uttarayan day from the morning.

Families, friends and all gear up for the grand festivity on every possible rooftop, which also turn into table tops for foodie Barodians with the elaborate spread of various types of chikkis, undhiya, jalebi and sugarcane to be abundantly devoured after every kite avenged, or lost. Young and old alike love to relax with the kites and enjoy the season’s first fun-filled festival.

“I am just setting up music system that will literally blare from our rooftop. Uttarayan is no longer just about kites, its also a mini Diwali of sorts and hence we too have kept fire crackers handy to burst in the evening,” said Sanjay Patel, a resident of old city area.

Another old city resident Maulik Shah has invited all his families and friends on his rooftop to enjoy mouth savouring ‘undhiyu’ and jalebi.

“After a day full of kite flying and screaming ‘Kai Po Che’ , we society members will have a dinner get-together with ‘sev usal’,” said Kimali Agrawal, a resident of Samta. There were some scenes of traffic jams at some junctions where stalls selling masks, accessories apart from kites were set up in the city.

The commissioner said that following the positive response for the Besant Nagar ‘swap shop’, the civic body will set up similar ‘shops’ ahead of festival seasons to promote reuse . Monday saw more patronage than the first day of the ‘swap shop’, officials said. The civic body ended up selling 6,716 items, bringing in a revenue of Rs 73 ,590.

P Jayanthi, a resident of Valmiki Nagar in Thiruvanmiyur, who was among the five volunteers who were honoured by the civic body chief on Monday told TOI that the idea to set up a swap shop was floated among residents about three weeks ago by Alby John, regional deputy commissioner. “In Adyar zone (Zone 13), we have vibrant residents’ welfare associations where waste segregation and other civic issues are constantly discussed. Residents met corporation officials again when Elliot’s beach was declared litter free on January 6 and then things started rolling.”

While in some areas, resident volunteers arranged for items to be collected in local community halls, some like Jayanthi undertook door-to-door collection along with corporation staff. Corporation officials said the volunteers also helped in fixing prices. TNN

The criticism comes two days after the state cabinet recommended to the Centre to conduct the socio-economic caste census as part of Census 2021. Both BJP and Congress questioned the motive behind the move saying, lack of Naveen’s commitment for the backward classes is reflected from the fact that the OBC Commission was not appointed.

“If the government actually wanted development of the OBCs, it would have appointed the OBC Commission. After staying in power for two decades, Naveen suddenly remembers the OBCs and demand SECC,” said BJP state general secretary Prithviraj Harichandan at a press conference. “While the Centre and many other states have extended 27% reservation to the OBCs, the BJD government in Odisha has failed to do so. There is no OBC reservation in education in Odisha while it is 11.5% in jobs,” he added.

The Narendra Modi-led government had accorded constitutional status to National Commission of Backward Classes last year. Speaking to reporters at Congress Bhawan, spokesperson Satya Nayak said, “The Naveen government had not constituted the OBC commission despite a direction from the Orissa high court in 2011. The state government had also submitted an affidavit in the HC in 2012 to form the OBC commission within six months. However, the same is yet to be done.” Nayak added that Naveen’s suggestion for SECC is to lure the OBCs ahead of the municipal elections later this year.

The BJD, however, defended the government’s move. Jagannath Sarka, minister for ST and SC development, minorities and backward classes welfare, said the process to form the OBC commission is already on. “It will be done soon,” he added. BJD spokesperson Sasmit Patra said, “If the socio-economically backward castes are enumerated, the data will help for any move for their development and welfare. The opposition should not politicise such an issue meant for people’s development.”

ROURKELA: A rally against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) in Sundargarh on Monday was disrupted allegedly by members of a fringe Hindu outfit, forcing police to intervene to prevent the situation from spiralling out of control.

The group demanding the withdrawal of CAA was led by district Congress leaders and comprised mostly of party workers. Senior Congress leaders, including former MLA George Tirkey and former Talsara MLA Prafulla Majhi, were at the forefront of the rally, which started from Nari Kalyan Kendra and was to end at the collector’s office after covering a large part of Sundargarh town , the district headquarters.

At 1 pm, when the rally was near the collector’s office, some youths from Hindu Ekta Manch, a fringe saffron outfit, allegedly taunted minority community members who were part of the Congress-led group. The heated exchange of words soon gave way to pushing and shoving between the two groups, prompting police to intervene. The anti-CAA rally, however, was allowed to continue and it ended as planned in front of the collector’s office.

Benudhar Tripathy, former district Congress Committee president, lodged a police complaint against the attackers.

A member of the Hindu outfit, on condition of anonymity, claimed they were forced to react when anti-national slogans were raised by the Congress workers. “Two youths in the anti-CAA rally were shouting things like ‘we will snatch independence’,” he said.

This was denied by a Congress delegation that met Sundargarh SP Soumya Mishra in the evening to submit a memorandum against the youths of the saffron outfit. “The rally was part of Congress’s nationwide protest programme against CAA and NRC. It was peaceful. No anti-national slogan was raised,” said former MLA Tirkey. “We met the Sundargarh SP and sought appropriate action against the culprits,” he added.

Police said they were on alert to prevent any escalation of tensions. “We are examining Congress’s complaint. No FIR has been filed by either group so far, but we are keeping a close watch on the developments,” said R N Barik, additional SP (Sundargarh).

249,['14/01/2020'],Andhra Pradesh Capital: End of Amaravati plan? Andhra Pradesh government to repeal CRDA Act,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Andhra chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy

AMARAVATI: The AP government has decided to repeal the Capital Region Development Authority ( CRDA ) Act which was brought in to build the new capital Amaravati. This would nullify the Amaravati master plan envisaged by the previous TDP regime.

The CRDA will be replaced by the erstwhile urban development board — Vijayawada-Guntur-Tenali-Mangalagiri Urban Development Authority (VGTM UDA). The VGTM UDA will now draft a new master plan for the entire area and not exclusively for the capital city.

The state government has also decided to offer additional land compensation to the Land Pooling Scheme (LPS) farmers. The government would grant 200 sq.yard of additional land to all those who gave land for the capital city. The LPS farmers would now get 1,600 sq yard instead of 1,400 sq yard as promised in the principal Act.

Similarly, the government had decided to grant annuity amount for three more years than the promise made in the CRDA Act. Farmers would now get annual lease amount for 13 years instead of 10 years earlier.

According to sources, repealing of the CRDA Act would help in growth in the existing capital city area as zonal restrictions in the Act had prevented farmers from going for development of their plots.

The state government has decided to offer additional sops without directly holding discussions with farmers who are staging protests in the capital city area. The high-level committee which met on Monday, however, appealed to farmers to send their representations to CRDA commissioner before January 17.

According to the draft bill, CRDA Act shall cease to exist and its jurisdiction shall vest in the VGTM Urban Development Authority to be constituted under the Metropolitan Region and Urban Development Authorities Act, 2016, which shall comprise such areas as deemed necessary and which are hitherto within the jurisdiction of APCRDA.

The state government shall be deemed to be the guarantor for all loans availed by CRDA and transferred to VGMTUDA. All the employees of CRDA would also be shifted to VGTM UDA.

Altogether 270 dolphins were sighted in Gahiramatha in 2015

KENDRAPADA: Nine teams of forest personnel will conduct dolphin census on January 19 in the water bodies of Gahiramatha marine sanctuary and its nearby areas in Kendrapada district. Dolphin census in Gahiramatha was conducted for the first time in 2015.

“In 2016, 2017 and 2018, the forest department cancelled the dolphin census due to bad weather. In 2015, we spotted 270 dolphins in the water bodies of Bhitarkanika National Park and Gahiramatha marine sanctuary,” said Bikash Ranjan Dash, the divisional forest officer of the park.

The forest personnel had sighted 58 Irrawaddy dolphins, 23 bottlenose dolphins, 123 Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin and 50 Indian Ocean humpback dolphin, 15 pan tropical spotted dolphins and one finless porpoise.

The 2015 dolphin census revealed that Bhitarkanika was home to state’s largest population of dolphins as then there were only 144 Irrawaddy dolphins in Chilika, said the forest officer, adding that Gahiramatha had more number of dolphins due to its large area. “In 2019, we counted 126 dolphins in the water bodies of Gahiramatha marine sanctuary. The sighting of dolphins depended upon the weather condition on the day of census,” he said.

Dolphin has been included in Schedule I of Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ), in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and categorised as endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) red list, said the forest officer.

Representative image

VADODARA: A probationary sub-inspector of Makarpura police station who has been on run for over seven months now in connection with the firing of three bullets at a man in Tarsali, was denied anticipatory bail on Monday.

S V Chudasama had sought bail on the grounds that the complaint was wrongly registered against him and he had already registered an attempt to murder plaint in connection with the same incident that took place on June 3.

Chudasama claimed that the firing took place accidentally when the injured person Simit Prajapati was trying to snatch his gun during a melee.

The additional public prosecutor R S Chauhan argued against Chudasama’s bail application and said that Chudasama had got into a brawl with Prajapati outside the latter’s father’s paan shop following which he took out his gun and fired three rounds at Prajapati. Two bullets hit him on lower abdomen and thigh. He further argued that the investigating officer had searched for him at several places, but Chudasama was nowhere to be found.

While turning down the cop’s bail plea, the court of additional sessions judge K M Sojitra upheld Chauhan’s arguments and also took into consideration that bullets fired from his gun had hit Prajapati in two places.

According to the case details, on June 3 night Prajapati and Chudasama had got into an altercation as the cop was fighting with the former’s father. Prajapati later alleged that during the brawl, Chudasama pulled out his gun and fired at him thrice.

On the other hand, Chudasama had alleged that while passing by Tarsali on his bike, he saw liquor was being sold at the paan shop and so confronted the owner and two other people there. The three persons got agitated at Chudasama and started to beat him up. They also tried to snatch his gun. It was during this melee that the gun fired accidentally and the bullets hit Prajapati.

253,['14/01/2020'],Students lock up college principal for seven hours,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Kozhikode: Students of the Sree Narayana Guru College at Chelannur locked up the college principal for around seven hours on Monday demanding revocation of the principal’s decision to dismiss a guest lecturer.

The students alleged that the principal was engaging in moral policing and that the guest faculty in the college, Mohammed Sahil, was dismissed for allowing boys and girl students to sit together in the classroom.

The students locked up principal V Devi Priya in her office from 11am till 6pm demanding revocation of the dismissal of the lecturer.

The students alleged that the principal took action against Sahil for allowing boys and girls to sit together in the first year postgraduate English class during a group activity in the classroom. “The principal came to the class and objected to boys and girls sitting together and reprimanded the teacher in front of the students. It was not an isolated incident. There have been other incidents of the principal objecting to boys and girls sitting together in the past as well,” said Vishnu M K, general secretary of the college union.

Meanwhile, principal Devi Priya denied the allegation that the guest faculty was dismissed for allowing boys and girls to sit together. “Such charges are totally baseless. I have not objected to the students sitting together. The teacher was terminated because of insubordination and rude behaviour towards the principal when inquired about his lack of class control in UG and PG classes,” she said, adding that the decision to dismiss the teacher was taken in consultation with the college management and that there was no need to discuss the matter with the students as it was an administrative matter.

Police removed the protesting students around 6pm. The college authorities have given two-day holiday for the college in view of the protests.

254,['14/01/2020'],Highest ever water bird count recorded at Mahanadi census,"This story is from January 14, 2020

CUTTACK: A record number of birds — 28,569 to be exact — were counted during the 5th River Mahanadi (Banki to Jobra) Odisha Water Birds Census, conducted by Wild Orissa under the aegis of Asian Water Birds (AWC) on Sunday.

The AWC is an annual exercise — and part of the International Water Birds Census — which is coordinated by the Bombay Natural History Society nationally and Wild Orissa in the state.

Secretary of WO and AWC’s Odisha coordinator, Monalisa Bhujabal, said 71 species were seen during the census, which covered a 50km stretch of the Mahanadi from Banki to Jobra. “The 2020 census figure of 28,569 water birds is the highest ever. The species diversity of 71 is also the highest we have found during the bird census. The last high was 58, recorded during 2018,” Bhujabal said.

Many rare and endangered bird species were recorded during the census, including Black Bellied Tern, Oriental Darter, Great Thick Knee, River Lapwing and River Tern, said Bhujabal added.

Convener of WO’s Bhubaneswar Regional Chapter, Suchitra Sahoo, supervised the census, in which more than 60 volunteers participated. Twelve census units counted the water birds on the Mahanadi, as well as on the wetlands and water-bodies on either side of the river bank, which form part of the Mahanadi riverine ecosystem.

“The data is being analysed in detail. The preliminary findings show that the Mahanadi ecosystem is extremely rich in avifaunal diversity and needs to be protected under the appropriate legal system. There is an immediate need to scale up the importance of this stretch of the Mahanadi under international monitoring systems,” AWC’s Odisha coordinator said.

An official release issued by WO on Monday said the result of the census would be used to promote national water bird and wetland conservation and international cooperation along the Central Asian Flyway and the East Asian-Australasian Flyway.

River Mahanadi falls within the Central Asian Flyway, which is the shortest flyway for migratory birds in the world. It lies entirely within the northern hemisphere and connects a large swathe of the palaearctic with the Indian subcontinent.

256,['14/01/2020'],"Safety, a blind spot for budget schools","This story is from January 14, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: The recent incident of an eight year-old student coming under the wheels of his school bus has raised multiple questions on how “budget schools” may be compromising on safety.

Budget schools is a term broadly applied to unaided private schools that cater to the lower economic strata and charge an annual fee of around Rs10,000-12,000.

One of the blind spots for such schools that operate on a bare minimum is transportation safety due to the absence of departmental scrutiny plus, unfortunately, the financial aspect of it.

“Instead of the normal Rs40,000 cost of the bus services, budget schools avail it for Rs20,000,” said Santosh Jog, president of School Bus Owners’ Association. “Bus owners make it financially viable by plying their vehicles at three different schools on the same day rather than being embedded with a single institution,” he said, adding that they strongly discourage membership for such bus companies in their association.

“The bus is then perpetually running from one place to the other picking up students from every by-lane and hence they don’t care about keeping a conductor or ensuring that a teacher is accompanying the bus,” said Jog.

He said all their members follow the guidelines strictly and have CCTVs installed as well.

There are safety guidelines issued by the court and also separately by CBSE which say that every bus must have a conductor as well as a teacher on board. If an incident occurs and neither of the two are on board, then the principal has to take responsibility according to the Headmasters’ Association ( Nagpur district ). Madhusudhan Mude, president of Headmasters Association (Nagpur district), said, “The reason for an accident is part of the investigation, but for schools, the immediate responsibility is to ensure compliance of the guidelines. I strongly feel that principals must be held accountable if they cannot ensure the presence of their teachers in these buses.”

He agreed that budget schools need to be supervised more aggressively.

The traffic police have already ramped up their action against violators. Chinmay Pandit, DCP (traffic) said, “We will be proceeding with a two pronged approach. First, will be action against violators while the second will be to create awareness. On Monday itself we took action against 215 violators. Now we will be interacting with schools and fleet owners to ensure that they are aware of the guidelines.”

There are just over 1,500 schools in the city with an overwhelming majority of them being budget schools. They run in congested by-lanes or residential areas with no playgrounds, proper safety or qualified teachers. But they cater to the aspiration of the lower economic class to send children to English medium schools. The downside is compromise on safety features, especially with transportation by bus. Parents can't afford to pay more and schools in turn can't provide value added services.

Captian Amarinder Singh

CHANDIGARH: Reacting to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh ’s statement that he would want to continue in the saddle for another term, Congress Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa on Monday said he would not support any such move until convincing action is taken in the sacrilege incidents. Capt Amarinder’s party colleague also advised him to pass on the baton is case he didn’t intend to take control and rein in the bureaucracy in the state.

Bajwa said he wouldn’t want to share the dais with the CM if the state government under him failed to act against those behind sacrilege but Amarinder still decided to run for another term. “The big names involved in sacrilege have to be taken to task,” he said. Commenting on Amarinder’s announcement not to quit politics until every family gets a job, Bajwa said such a task had not been achieved “even in a country like Switzerland, and Punjab cannot think of doing it any time soon”.

The former Congress state president also made a case for the Congress government renegotiating the power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the private plants in the interest of the consumers.

“Today, Akali Dal has begun targeting the Congress on the issue because we did not act for three years. If the chief minister of a state wants, it is not possible that the terms of the agreements cannot be reworked. There should be a white paper on the issue along with a technical audit. Otherwise, power consumers will have to face many more hikes,” he said.

“I am no fan of AAP’s ideology, but I appreciate Arvind Kejriwal managed to renegotiate the power tariff in Delhi. The Akali Dal has got a chance to accuse the Congress because did not act. The economically weak Dalits are worst affected by the higher tariff. Why hasn’t finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal put his foot down for renegotiating the purchase agreements?” he said. “The Punjab Assembly is set to meet this week and I would appeal to my party colleagues that they would take up the issue of power tariff in the session,” he added.

258,['14/01/2020'],Public works department eyes green technology for building roads,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Representative image

BHUBANESWAR: The public works department is considering a plan to adopt a pollution-free green road concept as part of which several stretches of roads in the state will be constructed in a sustainable and environment-friendly manner.

Under the plan, the works department here will collaborate with the CSIR-Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) in New Delhi, which will provide the BitChem ColdMix Technology that will be used in road construction in the state.

Experts said BitChem ColdMix is a technology that ensures zero pollution as it requires no heating. It is an energy-efficient and eco-friendly method of road construction that helps mitigate carbon footprint and also prevents adverse effects on the health of workers.

The move comes after CRRI director Satish Chandra recently wrote to chief minister Naveen Patnaik requesting him for a large-scale adoption of CRRI-BitChem ColdMix Technology to build pollution-free green roads in the state.

“Owing to no heating during black-topping activities, the technology helps secure the social impact of removing drudgery for the road construction workers by eliminating health hazards and providing a pollution-free construction,” Chandra had written about the BitChem ColdMix Technology.

He had further said this simple construction mechanism also enhances the speed of construction and presence of additives leads to longer durability compared to conventional hot-mix technology.

“We propose large-scale adoption of this innovative technology to all the states. This can be made a success by engaging in a long-term technology management agreement with CRRI and our technology partner M/s Bitchem,” Chandra had written.

A senior works department official said that they will go for the implementation of theis technology on a pilot basis, following which a large-scale adoption of the technology will be made. “We will first assess the outcome and then go for a larger-scale replication of the technology in the state,” the official added.

Road expert Sayed Maqbool Ali too said ColdMix is an innovative technology that will help construct roads in an eco-friendly manner.

“The state should consider the adoption of the green technology in large scale,” he added.

PALANPUR: A MSc final year student of Life Sciences in Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University has gone to Poland to further her studies on disappearing vultures and the dis-balance this has created in the socio-ecological sphere.

Jill Patel has left for Poland on Friday as part of student exchange programme after a MoU was signed with Polish Academy of Sciences. Her doctoral thesis on ‘Ecological Service Provided by Vulture’, based on particularly the funeral customs of the Parsi community, who dispose of their dead at the “Tower of Silence” for vultures to feed.

Jill is studying on how the community is being inconvenienced after the bird species started to dwindle in numbers rapidly.

Her guide Nishith Dharaiya, assistant professor of life sciences at the university had trained her for three months, while in Poland Jill will be guided in her research work by professor from the Polish Academy of Science, Nuria Selva, for another three months until March end.

The researcher will be given free accommodation and other facilities like institute fee, lab fee by the Polish government for her research work.

Dhariya, who had done research on sloth bears in North Gujarat, told TOI: “Jill was selected for the thesis on merit basis both by the local guide as well as the Polish guide, Selva. The aim of her study is to rethink on an alternative to the age-old Parsi ritual in view of declining population of vultures. We have also contacted around 80 people including priests in south Gujarat where the community thrives in large numbers for their perspectives in our study.”

Chennai: An accident claims tribunal in the city fixed 10% liability on an autorickshaw driver who was killed in a road accident for driving without a valid licence at the time of the accident. Rahul, 19, was killed as a truck rammed his autorickshaw. After making the cut , the tribunal directed the firm with which the truck was insured to pay Rs 17.41 lakh as compensation to Rahul’s family. In their appeal for compensation, Rahul’s parents said their son was driving his auto on Muthukumarasamy Salai in Chennai when a rashly driven truck rammed it, killing Rahul on the spot. The accident happened in December 2016. The family moved the tribunal seeking a compensation of Rs 60 lakh. The insurer of the truck contended that Rahul did not possess a valid licence at the time of the accident and hence said it cannot be held liable to pay compensation. After perusing the submissions, the tribunal noted that the accident happened only due to the rash driving by the truck driver. After computing various factors such as Rahul’s young age and his future prospects, the tribunal arrived at Rs 19.35 lakh as compensation.

AHMEDABAD: A day before Uttarayan , city crime branch seized Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) worth Rs 1,68,000 from an MUV near Odhav after a car chase. However, crime branch said two other SUVs, which tried to intercept the private cars in which the cops were travelling, managed to give them the slip.

Crime branch officials said the IMFL was being brought from Rajasthan for listed bootlegger Devendra Parihar alias Bansi. “We have registered a case against Bansi, the two persons, including one Vishal who fled from the car, and those who were in the two SUVs.

Crime branch officials said their team was on patrol on Sunday night, when about 1am they received a tip-off that an MUV without a registration number plate and carrying liquor is coming from Dehgam side.

“We laid a watch near Dehgam Circle. After a while we saw an MUV matching the description approaching Dehgam Circle. We signalled the driver to stop. The driver slowed the vehicle and suddenly sped off towards Odhav. We gave a chase in private cars. After a while two SUVs, also without registration number plates, started following the police cars and tried to intercept them,” said a crime branch official.

Crime branch sources said the crime branch teams continued the chase. “The MUV suddenly stopped as two of its tyres burst. Two people came out of the car and fled by jumping over the wall,” said a crime branch official. “We reached the car and found a mobile phone lying on the dashboard. The phone was on and the person on the other side was yelling ‘Bansi speaking, where have you reached?’ Then he suddenly said, ‘Run Vishal, run Vishal.’ We found 480 bottles of IMFL in the back of the car.”

Crime branch officials said they are hunting for Bansi and the others who had fled from the spot.

BHUBANESWAR: The ‘Bhubaneswar me’ app’s online grievance section has proved to be very popular with the people.

The number of complaints it has received online is higher than those the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has got offline.

The BMC has received 11,634 complaints, of which nearly 7,000 have been received online. The remaining have been registered on BMC’s toll-free landline number or through applications.

The BMC had launched the online grievance redress app in August 2018. People were not conversant with it initially but grievances started coming in from early 2019. Most complaints are related to street lights, parking, sanitation, planning, construction and holding tax.

“Of the 11,634 grievances, we have resolved 10,774. The remaining have been sent to various sections for resolution,” said a BMC officer. “Since the app has been integrated with all smart city-related apps and web portals, all concerned officers can see the complaints,” the officer added.

BMC officials said grievances received through applications or on the toll-free number were also recorded on the online platform. Citizens get an acknowledgement on their mobile number soon after a complaint is registered online.

“Earlier, we would have to go to the BMC office even for small matters. Now, all we need to do is download the app and post the complaint,” said Sitakanta Tripathy, a retired government employee of Sailashree Vihar.

Echoing a similar sentiment, resident Tribikram Chayani said, “I had posted a complaint about garbage being left unattended in our locality. I even posted a picture. The complaint was sent to the ward officer and then the sanitary inspector, who addressed it.”

CHANDIGARH: The Badal family treated the live telecast of gurbani from Golden Temple as yet another business and pressurised the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) to give rights to the channel which they own, Punjab panchayats and rural development minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa said on Monday. “Claiming rights over hukamnama (daily verse) and Sarb Sanjhi Gurbani telecast live from the Darbar Sahib amounted to sacrilege and it called for action as per the Sikh code of conduct against the culprits,” the minister added.

The private television channel, allegedly owned by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal and his family, had committed brazen sacrilege by claiming exclusive rights over hukamnama that is telecast live from the Golden Temple, Bajwa said.

Bajwa questioned the authority of the SGPC to hand over telecast rights as its duty was to carry it to every corner of the world and not authorise any other agency that would be interested only in profits.

A part of the tehsil premises has turned into a grazing ground for goats and cows

KENDRAPADA: Hundreds of rare and valuable documents, land records, journals, books, palm leafs and other papers have become brittle with age and are gathering dust in the 120-year-old tehsil office at Rajkanika in Kendrapada district.

Built in 1900 by Rajendra Narayan Bhanjadeo, the then king of Kanika, the century-old tehsil office is spread over two acres and was conceived to store land records and other documents. Bhanjadeo owned large tracts of land in Kendrapada, Bhadrak, Cuttack , Balasore and other districts of the state during the Raj era.

After Independence, the government abolished the estates of the Raja of Kanika and acquired the tehsil office as per the 1952 Odisha Estate Abolition Act. But thanks to the alleged negligence of the state government, the tehsil building in Rajkanika lies in a dilapidated condition.

“Though the building has its own unique architecture, it cannot withstand the vagaries of time without proper care. It used to be regarded as a treasure house of Rajkanika history, but it’s now a pale shadow of its former glorious self,” Subharansu Sutar of Rajkanika said.

A part of the tehsil premises has turned into a grazing ground for goats and cows. “The building is crumbling owing to the neglect of the district administration,” Kaliprasad Nayak, a retired teacher of Rajkanika, said.

When contacted, tehsildar (Rajkanika) DSS Joshi, said, “The tehsil office is not in good shape. The district administration had recently decided to build a new building at Rajkanika by demolishing the old one.”

The building serves as reminder of the history of Kendrapada. “It is time the government renovated it. We will oppose its demolition,” Mrutunjaya Samal, a lawyer, said.

267,['14/01/2020'],HC: Sculpture grads must get priority for sthapathi posts,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Chennai: Right to employment is a fundamental right and when a special institution is created for a specific purpose, it is the duty of the state to make way for adequate employment opportunities for graduates of such institutions, the Madras high court observed on Monday and directed the government to give ‘first priority’ to graduates from Government College of Architecture and Sculpture while filling the posts of engineers, draftsman and sthapathis.

The posts are for the newly constituted renovation and conservation wing under the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department.

Justice R Mahadevan passed the order on a plea moved by D V Murugan seeking direction to the authorities to appoint the sthapathi degree holders from Government College of Architecture and Sculpture, Mamallapuram , in the post meant for assistant engineer in every zonal office or alternately make provisions for appointment of such graduates as sthapathis as done in Andhra Pradesh in each division taking into consideration the number of temples in a particular division under the HR&CE department.

Allowing the plea, the judge said: “The knowledge in civil engineering alone is not sufficient to cater to the needs of renovation of temples including sculpting. Whereas, the students from the sculpting college or any other institution covering the field, who are also taught architecture and design with thorough knowledge in sculpting, would be eligible to be appointed in the HR&CE department.”

The appointment of such successful candidates as sthapathis would lessen the financial burden on the exchequer as they would be in a position to carry out minor repair work on their own with less role from third parties and they could perform twin functions of an engineer and that of sthapathi, Justice Mahadevan added. The court also directed the state to finalise and bring to life the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments engineering and subordinate service rules in three months.

Thiruvananthapuram: BJP is finalising the names of its district presidents. State committee member V V Rajesh will take over as president of the Thiruvananthapuram committee, the party’s most coveted district unit in the state.

After being suspended from organizational duties of the party for a brief period, for allegedly leaking to the media an in-house inquiry report that placed party general secretary M T Ramesh in the dock, Rajesh was reinducted into the state committee after P S Sreedharan Pillai replaced Kummanam Rajasekharan as the state chief. Regarded as a staunch loyalist of former state president and now union minister, V Muraleedharan, Rajesh is also in the good books of the RSS leadership. He was at the forefront of the Sabarimala agitation and enjoys a rapport with leaders and cadres, cutting across group lines.

The faction led by Muraleedharan and P K Krishnadas is all set to claim victory when presidents to 12 committees are announced, following consultations with the RSS leadership. Kannur and Kasaragod committee chiefs are yet to finalized, purportedly for want of the stamp of approval from the RSS.

In Pathanamthitta, where BJP has made deep inroads in recent years, Kulanada Ashokan is due to retain his post. In Thrissur, K K Aneeshkumar, the party’s district general secretary, will assume the office. BJP state secretary V K Sajeevan will be the new president in Kozhikode. In Kottayam, incumbent N Hari, who faced allegations of vote trading during the Pala bypoll, will continue to occupy the office. There is no clarity on the next chief of the Ernakulam committee. BJP may announce the list of presidents in a day or two. The state president is expected to be named in another week with party general secretary K Surendran having emerged as the frontrunner. Earlier, it was set to be announced by January 15. The full-time national president of the party could be named by January 26.

269,['14/01/2020'],Coimbatore to get 15 feeder ambulances,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Coimbatore region’s 108 operations is all set to get 15 feeder ambulances in the next three months. These are covered stretchers which will be attached to bikes, and will enable quick extractions from very narrow lanes in small villages or even extremely muddy roads where an ambulance cannot enter or will get stuck.

108 authorities in Coimbatore confirmed that the state government and GVK EMRI have decided to introduce the feeder ambulances as a pilot project. “These ambulances have already been tried in north India and in Andhra Pradesh and we have got positive feedback from them,” said an official. “The vehicles are as narrow as a hatchback car, making it easier to drive into extremely narrow lanes in rural areas and small villages.”

The feeder ambulances may drive the patient all the way to the closest government hospital for first aid treatment or to a rendezvous point and then transfer the patient to a full-fledged ambulance.

Of the 15 feeder ambulances, seven have been allocated to Coimbatore, five to the Nilgiris and three to Tirupur. 108 operators in the district believe this will make extractions faster. “At present, if the lane is too narrow for the ambulance to enter people carry the patient on a stretcher to the vehicle, and this takes time,” says manager Selvamuthukumar. “If it is successful and we see good benefits, the state government may sanction more such vehicles,” he said. “While bike ambulances don’t have stretchers attached, these feeder ambulances do.”

Additionally, some of 108 ambulance vehicles will be fixed with upgraded mountain rescue stretchers. These will be used in cases where even bike ambulances or feeder ambulances will not be able to enter. “The old stretchers have a flat base and straps which help only patients with suspected spine injuries. The new stretchers will be like dollies, where the base is slightly more flexible and will have railings on all four sides, so the patient will not roll off and will be comfortable when being carried down,” said Selvamuthukumar. All the four stretchers assigned to Coimbatore have been allocated to Valparai.

SAMBALPUR: A new academic building is set to come up on the premises of the Gangadhar Meher University ( GMU ) to solve the problem of shortage of classrooms in an ever-growing varsity.

UC Pati, deputy registrar of GMU, said, “The university has been facing problems owing to the shortage of classrooms for a very long time. The number of departments has increased. Four new departments were opened recently. However, there aren’t enough classrooms in the varsity. But the new academic building will help resolve the problem to some extent.”

The work of the building, which will house 15 classrooms for the students of the institution, has already begun. The ground plus two-storey building is being constructed over an area of 756 square metres. A target has been set to complete the construction of the new academic building within a year. Estimated to be built for around Rs 2.64 crore, the work of the building is being executed by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD).

Pati said the Rashtriya Uchachatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) has sanctioned Rs 27.5 crore to the GMU for various development work of the institution. The new academic building is being constructed from the funds sanctioned by the RUSA. At present, there are about 40 classrooms in the varsity, which offers 26 PG coures, 27 UG courses, 10 PhD and 19 MPhil courses apart from the self-financing ones. The student strength of the varsity is around 5,500.

Pati further said, “An administrative block has also been proposed to be constructed on the premises of the institution. The offices of the vice-chancellor, registrar, deputy registrar and some other officials of the varsity, which is functioning from the existing building, will be shifted to the administrative building once it is complete. The varsity will get 15 more rooms. These rooms could also be used as classrooms.”

KORAPUT: Suspecting foul play and demanding an impartial inquiry into the death of Congress leader Purusottam Gamang, the party’s district unit observed a road blockade from 6 am to 2 pm at Bangi Chhack under Ramanaguda police station limits in Rayagada district on Monday.

“We suspect foul play in the death of Purushottam Gamang and demand the state government for a probe by either a special investigation team (SIT) or Crime Branch. If our demand is not met, then we will raise the issue in Parliament for a CBI inquiry,” said Saptagiri Ulaka, Koraput MP (Congress).

Gamang died in a road accident hours after the Rayagada district and sessions judge Soma Sekhar Jena declared his election as chairperson of Rayagada zilla parishad as null and void on December 24. While going to Gunupur from Rayagada in his motorcycle, Gamang met with an accident near Tandikana chhack, about 50 km from Rayagada, around 8 pm on December 24 and sustained head injuries. He was admitted to Ramanaguda hospital and subsequently to Gunupur hospital, where he died.

The motorcycle that Gamang was riding did not have a scratch even though it is said he died in a road accident. “If the case is not handed over either to the SIT or Crime Branch, then we will observe Rayagada and Koraput district bandhs in the coming days,” said Congress MLA from Jeypore Tara Prasad Bahinipati.

Taramani Gamang, mother of Purusottam, said her son has been murdered in a pre-planned manner. “My son has been murdered and I suspect the involvement of influential persons in it. I will fight till I get justice,” she said.

As a fallout of the road blockade, traffic came to a grinding halt between Rayagada and Gunupur while shops and markets remained open. Gamang was elected ZP chairperson in March 2017. BJD’s Gangadhar Puala, a contender for the post, had challenged it in the district court.

The district and sessions court annulled the election in December 2018 and Gamang approached the Orissa high court against the ruling. In September 2019, the high court directed Gamang to present his side in the Rayagada district and sessions court which again nullified the election on December 24.

273,['14/01/2020'],IRSE official’s tender fraud touches Rs 100 crore,"This story is from January 14, 2020

HYDERABAD: A railway contract fraud, involving South Central Railway project director (bridge works) M Ravindranath Reddy, an Indian Railway Service of Engineers ( IRSE ) officer, appears to be bigger than what CBI initially suspected. A back of the envelope calculation put it over Rs 100 crore, sources said.

So far, CBI has found that Rs 103 crore worth of railway projects were handed over to an ineligible company, Krishi Infratech, while Reddy was working as chief engineer in South Western Railway in Bengaluru.

CBI sleuths, who raided his official quarters in Hyderabad and Bengaluru on January 9, had booked three separate FIRs. In two of the FIRs, Ravindranath Reddy has been named as prime accused.

In the first FIR booked for cheating, criminal conspiracy and Prevention of Corruption Act, CBI named Ravindranath Reddy, Sherfuddin and P Mohanan — both deputy chief engineers— and Krishi Infratech partner M Suryanarayana Reddy as accused. In the FIR CBI alleged, “The fraud is about tenders released for construction of road over bridges, road under bridges and station buildings and foot over bridges between 2011 and 2018. Though Krishi Infratech was ineligible, norms were flouted to give contracts.”

The railway officials reportedly split the tender for the work worth Rs 76 crore into two for Rs 38 crore each and accommodated Krishi Infratech, which had eligibility to take up work up to Rs 50 crore. Also, Rs 54.2 crore was paid against the contract value of Rs 37.6 crore to Krishi. Similarly Rs 48.8 crore was paid against contract value of Rs 38.4 crore, though there was ample scope for inviting fresh tenders. The company was paid revised cost even before approval from the competent authority.

In the second FIR, which pertained to awarding contract for the Mysore-Ramanagaram doubling work, apart from Ravindranath Reddy, the agency had named Bhansode, a deputy chief engineer, and Suryanarayana Reddy as accused.

The eligibility criteria was that bidders should have completed execution of 19,640 cubic metres blanketing in similar work. The officials reportedly issued a false work completion certificate in June 2011 and ensured Krishi Infratech was eligible for the bids. The company failed to submit bank guarantee and the IRSE official showed undue favour by allowing a backdated bank guarantee. An additional Rs 1.43 crore was paid wrongfully, the FIR stated.

In the third case, CBI booked executive engineer Ghanshhyam Pradhan for having assets worth Rs 2.25 crore disproportionate to his known sources of income. CBI officials found that funds were transferred from the accounts of Krishi Infratech and Suryanarayana Reddy. He was looking after high-value work, including track doubling projects, between 2010 and 2019.

Amravati: Assuring that state government was committed to maintaining law and order, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said a recruitment drive to fill up nearly 8,000 vacancies will be launched soon to strengthen the police force.

Deshmukh was speaking at the 51st death anniversary function of JD Patil alias Babasaheb Sangludkar at Smt Kokilabai Gawande Mahila Mahavidyalaya in Daryapur on Monday.

Advising rural youths to focus on various competitive exams besides preparing for police recruitment, Deshmukh expressed concern over increasing number of student suicides and urged parents not to burden their children with undue expectations.

Stating that stringent laws for curbing atrocities against women were under active consideration of the government, Deshmukh said steps would also be taken to end illegal moneylending and Naxalism.

State’s women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur said stringent measures would be initiated to clamp down on child labour practices and ensure child security. She also assured comprehensive steps to tackle malnutrition.

KANAKAPURA: The Sangh Parivar on Monday demanded that the Karnataka government reverse its decision to allot land for a 114-foot-high statue of Jesus Christ in Kapalabetta by January 25 or face further protests.

Hundreds of Hindu Jagaran Vedike workers took part in the “Kanakapura Chalo” march amid heavy police deployment on Monday. They also submitted a memorandum to the government.

After the march, the Sangh Parivar passed a resolution: “If you (state government) don’t act by January 25, we will step up our protest and won’t stop till we succeed.”

The resolution wants work at Kapalabetta halted, cases against officials who allowed construction before the pasture land was allotted to the trust, and a strong anti-conversion law in the state.

Chennai: A four-member gang that tried to attack the husband of Thiruvalangadu union councillor in Tiruvallur was nabbed by residents on Monday. The residents gave the assailants a sound thrashing before handing them over to police. Police identified the arrested as Vishnu, 22, and Nitheshkumar, 19, of Rajapadmanabapuram, and Iyyappan, 22, and Abdul Razzaq, 19, of Perumpakkam.

Jeeva won the councillor post in the recently concluded local body polls. Since the panchayat union president post was reserved for women, Jeeva was in fray for the post. Jeeva’s husband has been trying to garner support for her election as president, police said. Rivals may have engaged henchmen to eliminate Jeeva’s husband to have a better chance at winning the president’s post, police said. On seeing the four men near Kosasthalaiyar riverbank on Sunday, villagers caught them and thrashed them as they allegedly possessed weapons. They informed police and handed over the suspects. Police have registered a case and launched a probe. TNN

278,['14/01/2020'],City outskirts witness real estate boom,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The proposal to set up the executive capital in the outskirts of Visakhapatnam has resulted in a real-estate boom towards Vizianagaram and Bhogapuram, way beyond GVMC limits and outside the district.

Sources in CREDAI disclosed that there was a major real estate boom in these areas, even more than the outskirts of Visakhapatnam. They pointed out that plots in areas beyond Visakhapatnam district towards Vizianagaram and Bhogapuram were not only more affordable, but also far closer to the area earmarked for building the executive capital.

Chilukuri Srinivas, vice-president, CREDAI, said, “It is quite natural for real estate boom to occur in these areas. Colonies within GVMC limits have been built choc-a-block and most of the projects are apartment projects. But beyond Tagarapuvalasa, towards Bhogapuram and Vizianagaram, there are many large gated housing site projects which are still affordable. Hence, the boom.”

Srinivas added that the boom in these areas was touching a100% mark after the executive capital proposal was made. “ If you take the 7km stretch just beyond Tagarapuvalasa, where Visakhapatnam district ends and Vizianagaram district begins, the hike in the last one month has been 100%.

The rate per square yard towards Bhogapuram has gone up from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000. However, towards Vizianagaram town, the jump is 100 per cent from close to Rs 10,000 up to Rs 20,000.” Explaining the reasons for the incredible jump in rate per square yard, Srinvas pointed that a plot of land will always have better value than an apartment, which is one of the reasons many are willing to invest in plots.

He added that people would prefer to buy a plot of 200 square yards for Rs 20,000 per square yard, rather than a 1,000 square-feet apartment for the same price in Madhurawada area. “Vizianagaram and Bhogapuram would be far closer to the administrative area, rather than much of the present city of Visakhapatnam,” he said.

The number of VMRDA approved layouts are also on the rise, sources in the Engineering department pointed out. There are close to 100 approved gated housing communities towards Vizianagaram and Bhogapuram.

Bicholim: A meeting between mining company officials and farmers, held on Monday in the office of the Bicholim deputy collector, to resolve the issue of transportation of mining ore through Mayem village, remained inconclusive.

Mayem farmers had opposed ore transportation through the village and had demanded compensation for damaged farms. They also threatened to stop it till their demands are met.

While mining company officials claimed the Mayem road is demarcated as district road and they are well within their rights to use it to transport ore, the farmers showed a Central government circular that clearly states that any road that goes through a village should not be used for mining ore transportation.

PANAJI: Congress on Monday insisted that the government was trying to undermine local self-governing bodies by curtailing the powers of panchayats in issuing construction and occupancy licences for housing or commercial projects.

Party office-bearers had a meeting to discuss the issue where they demanded that the panchayat department withdraw their January 7 circular.

The party’s panchayat raj cell had convened a meeting of sarpanchs, deputy sarpanchs and panchas of village panchayats in Goa at the Congress house to discuss the latest circular.

Several panchas said that the government was trying to weaken the autonomy of panchayats in the garb of garbage management.

Spokesperson Tulio de Souza said the circular, initiated by panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho, will increase corruption, both at the state government level as well as at the panchayat level. “This circular must be scrapped as this circular is the murder of self-governance,” said de Souza.

Panchas said that the government had never discussed the move to involve block development officers and the director of panchayat in the process to grant occupancy certificates and construction licences.

“All the panchayats will come together and lock our offices and submit the keys to the panchayat director,” Chinchinim – Deussua panchayat member John Bedo Pereira said.

Meanwhile, Goa Congress Panchayat Raj Sanghatna, chairman, Joseph Sequeira, blamed the government for not assisting panchayats in garbage management.

JNUTA members raise slogans against the VC, blaming him for the violence that erupted on the campus

NEW DELHI: Confusion prevailed on JNU campus on Monday as teacher and student bodies rejected the university administration’s call to resume classes.

The JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) said that there was no question of starting the winter session when virtually no exams were held in the monsoon semester. The administration, in turn, issued a notice to the teachers for not carrying out their duties. As a result, even as all schools opened, there were no classes. JNUSU, too, issued a boycott call.

In the morning, JNUTA members raised slogans against vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar, blaming him for the violence that had erupted on the campus on January 5. They alleged that Kumar was involved in several discrepancies and called for his ouster, a demand they again raised at a meeting with MHRD later in the day.

Bikramaditya Choudhary, a teacher, said: “When exams for the monsoon semester have not taken place, how can there be a question of starting the winter session?”

Earlier in the day, the administration came out with an advisory and urged teachers to resume classes in the interest of students. It claimed that 12 deans and seven chairpersons of special centres had appealed to students and teachers to “refrain from any activity that would hinder the conducive atmosphere in the functioning of the university”. However, there was no clarity on the identity of these deans and chairpersons.

Dean of School of International Studies, Ashwini Mohapatra, a member of the breakaway JNU Teachers’ Federation, claimed that classes did not happen even though a few students did turn up.

The administration said the appeal was issued after two JNUTA office-bearers announced a “non-cooperation” plan. “The above call for non-cooperation not only goes against the efforts of the administration for restoration of normalcy on campus and resumption of academic activities, but also reflects the intention of JNUTA to disrupt normal functioning of the university (sic),” it said, adding the new semester had begun with registration of more than 5,000 students.

JNUTA, however, said that “it rejects totally the advisory issued by the administration and the warnings issued to it against organising assemblies around the academic complex”. “Teachers need no lesson on their duties or their norms of conduct from those who are guilty of using thugs to terrorise the university community and yet pretend they are governing an institution of higher learning,” it said.

Margao: Following criticism from several quarters over the scheduled jaunt to Mt Abu, Rajasthan, by the councillors of the Margao Municipal Council ( MMC ), the chairperson, Pooja Naik, on Monday declared that the study tour has been cancelled as per the advice of Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai.

In a press statement, Naik said that the decision was taken “keeping in mind that our councillors should as far as possible avoid the exercise of going on tours at the cost of the tax payers”.

Naik even exhorted her fellow councillors to emulate Sardesai in not misusing the tax payer’s money. “Even in the past, the Fatorda MLA when a minister in the cabinet had not used a government vehicle and other perks. I request our councillors to follow suit and rethink the study tour which was meant to study ‘development of green spaces and parks’ under AMRUT scheme in Mt Abu,” Naik said.

Earlier in the day, a few Margao residents led by Savio Coutinho of the Shadow Council for Margao wrote to the director of municipal administration (DMA) and the MMC chief officer, questioning the logic of organising the tour at the fag-end of the council’s tenure.

Following this, not only TRS even other political parties also have not issued Form-B to declare official candidates .For instance, as many as 134 TRS candidates filed nominations for 49 wards in Kamareddy municipality. In speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy’s Banswada constituency, 80 aspirants are in the fray from 19 wards. In Rajanna-Sircilla district, represented by KTR himself in the assembly, 276 candidates filed nominations hoping to get a chance to contest on the TRS symbol.Sources in State Election Commission (SEC) said that about 250 nominations had been withdrawn in the past two days.

288,['14/01/2020'],The race to improve response time,"This story is from January 14, 2020

In a field where every minute matters, six months after GPS navigation systems were fitted into 108 ambulances in the district, the response time has come down by 1 minute and 13 seconds, shows data from the service operated by GVK EMRI. They say the 108 avasaram app introduction and usage has also helped in reducing the response time, because the location can easily be locked in and mapped.

However, authorities are now attempting to bring the time down by another 2 minutes. The response clocked in by 108 ambulances in the city since November till this week has been 14 minutes. This is one minute and 13 seconds lesser than the 15 minutes and 13 seconds being clocked in by the service even in September and October.

“The GPS that was fitted in all the vehicles six months ago and more people downloading and using the avasaram 108 app helped, because the location is easily locked and drivers just need to reach the location,” said Coimbatore manager of 108 ambulance Selvamuthukumar. “Earlier, we had to ask people for landmarks and directions, which used to delay us,” he said. “The app, when opened by the user, directly transmits the location to our centre in Chennai, from where the location is sent to the vehicle’s GPS.

While the avasaram 108 app is only available in google play store, even non-smart phone users or those without internet can transmit their location with a technology called dual tone multi-frequency. The location reaches the ambulance’s GPS directly.

“Despite technological advances, our response time is at least 5 minutes lesser than what 108 achieves in Chennai, which is 8 minutes, 48 seconds. This year, we are aiming to bring down our response time to 12 minutes. The difference in timing is also because of the work on bridges going on in the district, including at Kavundampalayam, Trichy Road and Aathupaalam,” said Selvamuthukumar. “It makes a difference because Mettupalayam Road and highways beyond Aathupaalam see a lot of road accidents.”

Experts point out that Hyderabad has seen unprecedented growth in commercial leasing activity in last few years.Thanks to strong demand, attractive rentals and infrastructure push, the city has emerged as a major location for global investors. In a report, CBRE South Asia said that Hyderabad’s office space has gone up in extended IT corridor and was mainly driven by higher demand from IT/ITeS firms.According to Anshuman Magazine, chairman and CEO, CBRE India, the office sector growth was driven by demand from MNCs and local companies in Bengaluru and Hyderabad.Total leasing activity grew by over 25% in 2019, while rental values remained stable. New office space supply also rose to 52 million sq ft in 2019 from 35.7 million sq ft in 2018. In fact, gross leasing activity in 2019 touched a historic high of 61.6 million square ft, experts said.Bengaluru, Hyderabad, NCR Delhi and Mumbai dominated office space leasing accounting for 75% of overall space take-up. Annual space take-up increased in all cities except Kochi. Bengaluru continued to be the market leader with gross absorption of 15 million sq ft in 2019, while Hyderabad witnessed 9.5 million sq ft of gross absorption.Special Economic Zones accounted for one-third of leasing activity, mainly in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Interestingly, a quarterly dip in supply and leasing activity was observed at 5% in the last quarter of 2019. Addition of office space supply in quarter IV reduced by more than 50% to 7.8 million sq ft in NCR Delhi, Pune, Hyderabad and Chennai.The real estate sector attracted both institutional investors and developers, with nearly $1.5 billion worth capital pumped in Quarter-IV of 2019.

HYDERABAD: Rangoli during Sankranti is being extensively by the ruling TRS to campaign for its candidates in the municipal polls. In Nalgonda and Khammam , women cadres of the party are portraying the car symbol of the party in rangoli done in front of their houses.

With Sankranti on Wednesday, a competition was organised for locals at Lakkaram Tank Bund in Khammam wherein the TRS symbol was depicted in a decorative huge rangoli on Sunday.The Lakkaram Tank Bund, which is a big tourist attraction, was opened in 2018.

“Publicising the car symbol in rangoli also benefits us as we can reduce the campaign costs,” transport minister Puvvada Ajay said while appealing to all the women cadre to showcase the car symbol in the rangoli traditionally done in front of the houses as part of the festival.

For TRS cadres, the idea is more than a suggestion as a ‘car’ displayed as part of the festivities will also give the candidates the assurance about which way the votes will swing. Rangoli will be used in all the five municipalities to campaign for the party in the elections.

Ajay credited IT minister KT Rama Rao with giving the idea for using rangoli as a campaign tool. He asked all the leaders of TRS in the municipalities to go from house to house telling the TRS cadre to display the car symbol’ in the rangoli. “This show of TRS symbol will give us an advantage over opposition parties,” he said.

It is not just the car symbol, the women cadre have also been advised to publicise the schemes implemented by the TRS government in the rangoli. In Nalgonda, at the instance of energy minister G Jagadish Reddy, TRS cadres on Monday displayed rangoli with the party symbol in front of their houses.

Nagpur: Four days after inaugurating Khau Galli at the hands of city MP and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, the BJP-ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) said the food street located on banks of Gandhisagar Lake will be ready for Nagpurians from January 26.

There are 32 stalls and they were allotted to interested parties through draw of lots. A press release issued by the NMC said the stall owners will need shutters, counters and display boards and to make all these available will take some time. “NMC will provide wash basins, drinking water and separate electricity meters to all the stalls and this is the reason for the delay in opening of the Khau Galli,” the release stated.

Earlier in the day, a delegation of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) activists met municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar and expressed displeasure over inaugurating the incomplete Khau Galli. Though the NMC has now claimed to start the food street full-fledged from January 26, MNS workers said it will take almost a month to complete the works.

HYDERABAD: With municipal polls around the corner, NRIs are going all out to help political parties in their campaigning. With some landing in the city over the weekend, others are helping out on social media right from where they are.

“Our team met minister K T Rama Rao last week and was asked to start campaigning,” said president for TRS wing in Australia Nagender Reddy Kasarla. He said that about 12 people from a core team had landed in the city from Australia and more would arrive closer to the polls. Since their arrival last week, the core team has met a slew of TRS party members.

Not Just Australia, but from the US and UK too teams were strategising for the polls. “Many of us are planning to come and help out with the polls,” NRI TRS UK vice-president, Naveen Reddy, said and added that those who cannot come are taking the battle online.

“There are at least 50 active members on social media. What we are primarily focusing on is counter anti-TRS propaganda and bringing out the ground reality of how the government's schemes have worked,” Naveen said adding that they are providing statistics to dismiss attacks.

Supporting the BJP in the US is the Overseas Friends of the Bharatiya Janata Party (OFBJP). “While not many of our members are going to be travelling to India, they are very active on social media,” said OFBJP president Krishna Reddy. He said they were preparing short videos to speak to highlight the difference the party can make.

“Members are also calling their family and friends to support BJP candidates, especially NRIs who have lived in areas which are going to polls,” said Krishna Reddy.

NEW DELHI: After five-time Matia Mahal MLA Shoaib Iqbal, Congress’ Vinay Mishra , a young functionary from west Delhi who is son of former party MP Mahabal Mishra , and Ram Singh Netaji from Badarpur joined Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday. Welcoming them with AAP caps, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said they were joining the party to work together for a better Delhi. The new entrants said they were impressed with AAP’s governance.“I am happy that these leaders are joining us to work together to create a better future for Delhi. I am sure that the day is not far when all 2 crore people of Delhi will join AAP, though that would be just a formality as AAP already resides in their hearts,” Kejriwal said, adding that the newly inducted functionaries would strengthen the party.Singh, who was elected as an Independent MLA in 1998 and as a BSP candidate in 2008 from Badarpur, had unsuccessfully contested on a Congress ticket in both 2013 and 2015. Mishra had lost from Palam as a Congress candidate in 2013 and could manage to poll only a little over 19,500 votes.People were fed up with the politics of BJP and Congress because both parties did not deliver on their promises and had elected AAP five years ago, said Kejriwal. “AAP has stayed true to the promises made in its manifesto and won hearts of all. Whether a supporter of BJP, Congress or any other party, AAP has gained a place for itself in every heart because of its sincerity. AAP has managed to touch and transform their lives with its work and this time they will vote for AAP, irrespective of personal party affiliation,” the AAP national convener claimed.Some other functionaries who also joined AAP included Jai Bhagwan Upkar, BSP councillor of Rohini-C; and Rajkumari Dhillon, a former Congress councillor of Hari Nagar.Mishra, who has his roots in Bihar, said AAP’s work in unauthorised colonies and hospitals and on education had impressed him the most. “I have seen how people from UP, Bihar and other states had to struggle to get medical treatment, education and other facilities here. The condition of unauthorised colonies improved only after AAP came to power.”Singh, known to have a stronghold in Badarpur, said, “Everyone in Delhi has witnessed the hard work of Kejriwal and his government.

Agitators on Monday held a sit-in protest at Lohia Maidan, Margao, demanding immediate revocation of the CAA

MARGAO: Agitators on Monday held a sit-in protest at Lohia Maidan, Margao, demanding immediate revocation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) “since it violates the basic secular character of the Indian Constitution”.

Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat , told the gathering that the act was an attempt to target people of a particular religion and urged people to oppose it. “The Constitution of India bears no link with citizenship and religion. With this act, the Constitution has been amended to link citizenship to religion. For the first time people had to take to the streets to protest against an act. Our party stand is clear – we won’t allow the act to be implemented,” Kamat said.

State Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Elvis Gomes, in his address, said that the CAA aimed at dividing the people along religious lines and expressed his party’s resolve to staunchly oppose it. “The people of India have decided not to allow this to happen, whatever be the price they may have to pay for it,” Gomes said.

Speaking further, Gomes expressed fears that genuine citizens would be deported on account of the act. “BJP, in the past, tried to cancel holidays of Good Friday, St Xavier’s feast and Id. That was the beginning of the attempt to bring in this Bill. Sometimes we fail to recognize the moves,” Gomes said.

Condemning the police crackdown on students at JNU, Gomes said, “It is the duty of the government to provide good education to students, but here we find the police beat up students. We don’t want CAA, NPR of NRC; we want our students’ careers to be secure.”

Demanding that the Union government “take care to preserve the secular character and spirit of the Constitution,” the gathering resolved to “continue our fight firmly to preserve the secular fabric of India where all citizens, irrespective of religion, cast, creed, region and political affiliations have equal rights to live and prosper.”

Kannur: Those in the forefront of the agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) are the ones who have realized that the Constitution of India and secularism are facing threat, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan .

Inaugurating the public meeting in Thalassery on Monday, against the CAA, organized under the aegis of Constitution Protection Committee, he said that this agitation is equivalent to that of the freedom struggle, and no law that is against the Constitution would survive.

Observing that the National Population Register (NPR) is the first step towards National Citizenship Register (NCR), he reiterated that NPR would not be implemented in Kerala. “There is no need for misunderstanding in this connection,” he said adding that the power of joint fight against such laws is very strong.

“Though opposition parties initially agreed to the joint struggle, they later retracted from it,” he said adding that some people have a narrow mentality.

“There will not be any enumeration with the aim of implementing NCR and there is no need for any worry about it,” he said adding that no community will have to face any issue in the state in the name of CAA. “Everybody who has born in Kerala would get birth certificate,” he said.

Criticizing the BJP and the RSS over the CAA issue, he said that the Sangh Parivar had always opposed secularism in India, and their effort is to transform India into a religion-based country. “They have no role in the freedom struggle and now they are humiliating the Constitution of India,” he said. “The RSS has not imbibed the culture of India and followed Nazism as their policy,” he said.

In the same way as they have divided Kashmir by scrapping the special status given to the state, the effort is on to divide other states as well, alleged the chief minister adding that there are protest all over the world against CAA. All India Sunni Jamiyyathul Ulama general secretary Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musliyar, who presided over the function, said the BJP claim that Muslims had some misunderstanding about the CAA is wrong.

“We have no misunderstanding and our understanding is right,” he said adding that the CAA is against Indian Constitution and the aim is to transform India into a nation belonging to a particular community.

298,['14/01/2020'],Low price of jaggery dampens ‘Pongal’ spirit among producers,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Erode: Jaggery producers in Erode district are busy churning jaggery expecting a large demand during Pongal festival and the subsequent month. But they are apprehensive whether they could realise profit from sales as the production cost is above the current market price of jaggery.

More than 600 cottage units are working round the clock in Andhiyur, Modakurichi, Bhavani, Mullamparappu, Kavindapady, Arachalur, Perundurai and Ammapet areas in the district. “Between Diwali and Pongal, all jaggery units will remain busy,” M Gunasekaran, a jaggery producer told TOI. Big producers would produce at least 3,000kg per day, while small units would make 800kg per day, he said

During Pongal, the production would be doubled, jaggery unit owners said. “During non-festival seasons, each unit will produce one tonne of jaggery a day. There are three production cycles. Demand would be at its peak during January and February,” they said.

However, the busy outlook is hiding the struggle the producers are facing this year. “Usually we used to source sugarcane from local farmers. But in the past five years, the number of sugarcane farmers in the district had dwindled and so we are procuring sugarcane from other districts including Salem, Dharmapuri and Namakkal districts,” T Malaravan, another jaggery producer from Bhavani, said.

“We procure sugarcane at a cost Rs 3,000 per tonne from farmers. Adding transportation cost, labour charges and other raw material expenses, the production cost of converting one tonne of sugarcane is Rs 4,800,” Malaravan said. From one tonne of sugarcane, a unit will produce 80-90kg of jaggery.

The current market price of 30kg of jaggery is Rs 1,250. “But we have to sell the produce above 1,700 per 30kg to realise profit. With only two days for Pongal, we don’t know how much the price would rise,” M Gunasekaran, a producer from Bhavani, said.

To avoid such situation in future, the jaggery producers urged the state government to distribute ‘nattu sarkarai’, which is produced from jaggery, instead of white sugar in the ration shops. The cottage units will benefit from such move, they said.

I’ve been a comedian for 15 years now. Self-respect walked out of the door a long time back!” As a comedian, Papa CJ is used to coming up with one-liners. But when he sat down to write his first book, an autobiography titled Naked , he realised that there was more to writing a book than coming up with jokes. “Self-discipline was my biggest challenge,” he says about the most difficult thing writing entailed. “Motivating someone who can get on stage to write his story down in book form is not an easy task. Eventually what motivated me was the fact that the medium of print gave me the opportunity to create a richer experience for my audience by including anecdotes from life and layers of emotion that a stand-up comedy stage may not have,” he says. Edited excerpts from an interview he gave TOI:

Writing truthfully or facing a thousand strangers, what makes you more nervous?

Writing truthfully for sure. I do have experience with sharing my life and being publicly vulnerable. With my stage show Naked, I opened myself up in ways that I never thought I’d have the courage to do before. Yet, while doing that, my audience was still in the room in front of me, where I could see them and if need be adapt my performance, albeit in a tiny way, to effect some degree of control on how they processed what I presented them. With the book, I didn’t have that. Also, an autobiography is a daunting venture for a first-time author because readers will be judging the quality of my work as well as the quality of my life. I have tried to be as honest and vulnerable as I can in a medium that I have little experience with. However, early feedback from readers has been quite heartwarming so my nerves are a lot more settled now.

You have been doing the stand-up gig for long. How do you ensure the sameness doesn’t get to you?

For starters, stand-up isn’t the only thing I do. I’m a motivational speaker and executive coach. I also undertake various charitable initiatives under my Happiness Project . I run interesting customised corporate training modules including ‘A Comedian’s Guide to Marketing and Content Strategy’. And if you’ve seen my stand-up, you will know that a large part of it is unscripted crowd interaction. There are times where I’ll go on chatting with the crowd for 45 minutes without telling the audience one pre-written joke. It also makes it special for the audience because they enjoy the spontaneity and know that it is a unique experience exclusive to them and no other audience in the world will ever see that show.

Stand-up comedy has become an aspirational career for youngsters today. Does this change in perception of stand-up make you happy? What do you remember about your early days about how people perceived stand-up?

When I started doing stand-up comedy an aunt asked me, “Son, what do you do?” I said, “Aunty I’m a stand-up comedian. I tell jokes.” She said, “Son, even I tell jokes but what do you do for a living?” This was more than ten years ago and stand-up has received greater recognition as a credible profession since, which does make me happy. However, if you’re going to go the distance in this profession it’s best you start caring less about other people’s perceptions about it. You won’t last long unless you have both a love for doing it and a very thick skin.

Do you think Indian stand-up comedy has a long way to go to make itself felt in the international scene? Is it going in the right direction?

Off the top I don’t know why going international needs to be a criteria for measuring success. I believe we should be allowed to create our own definition of what success means to us and chase those ideals as opposed to parameters defined by somebody else. As regards the stand-up comedy scene in our country, it is at an early stage of evolution. Over time not only will comedians evolve as they traverse their inner journeys but audiences will also evolve and demand more and better. That being said we already have a vast pool of talent, some very good, who are working hard and making a name for themselves both domestically and internationally.

For a country with diverse languages, do you think regional comedy is something that Indian comedians should look at if they want to make it big?

Oh absolutely! If you try and fit a certain mould that isn’t authentic to you, it is quite possible that you will be unhappy or unsuccessful or both. The beauty of our country is that the size and diversity allows for comedians to be succeed in any language and any genre. They can be true to themselves and comfortable in their skin and no matter what form that may be, there is a large enough audience for that. My friend Praveen Kumar’s incredible success when transitioning from English to Tamil is a superb example of the same.

Would you say longevity of career is the biggest challenge for a stand-up comedian? In these times of Netflix specials and YouTube videos, how do you ensure that you are not overexposed?

You are right in that comedian’s do face the challenge of deciding how much content to put out there. They need to put enough to become popular but not so much that they have nothing fresh to perform when the audience comes into the room. They also need to realise that millions of hits on a three-minute online video will not teach them how to entertain a live audience for an hour. You can only learn that by doing it repeatedly on stage. Fortunately the online challenge is not one I’ve have to deal with a lot. My passion has always been live stand-up so I don’t really put a lot of content online. I also encourage my audiences to come watch the real thing live instead of surfing comedy porn.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A potentially breakthrough cancer-fighting technology involving a molecule extracted from turmeric has won Thiruvananthapuram ’s Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences a US patent.

According to Lissy Krishnan, head of Sree Chitra’s research team, delivery of “curcumin” directly to the affected tissues rather than through conventional oral or intravenous methods enables it to target malignant cancer cells while sparing the healthy ones around them.

Turmeric has proven anti-cancer properties and curcumin, a molecule extracted from it, is easily absorbed by the body and aids blood clotting, Krishnan said. At Sree Chitra, research funded by the Indian Council for Medical Research focused on processing curcumin to form a easy-to-use wafer configuration. When applied to body tissues, the curcumin present in the wafer is released into tissue fluids.

Human albumin, or rich proteins present in the fibrin clot produced from heavy bleeding, binds albumin receptors to cancer cells, thereby permitting its entry into the cells. Simultaneously, the fibrin clot is removed by the body’s natural clot breakdown mechanism without any adverse effect.

“The fibrin wafer is targeted for implantation into the affected site after surgical removal of cancer tissue for killing any remaining malignant cells that have the potential to cause recurrence of cancer or spread to other parts of the body. In addition to drug delivery, the fibrin wafer can promote blood clotting at the surgical site,” said Asha Kishore, director of Sree Chitra.

The institute is ready to transfer the technology for future development of curcumin as an anti-cancer treatment through animal and clinical trials. “The US patent adds value to our efforts to transfer technology and boosts the industry’s confidence in exploring validation and trials with international markets in mind,’’ Kishore said.

302,['14/01/2020'],"CCP waste fire takes 12 hours, 48,000 litres of water to douse","This story is from January 14, 2020

The loss was estimated at Rs 40 lakh. Fire personnel helped save property worth Rs 60 lakh

Panaji: A major fire broke out the city’s wet garbage facility at Patto on Monday which took fire fighters 12 hours and 87,000 litres of water to douse.

A two-year-old earth moving machinery, an organic waste converter, crates and other equipment were gutted in the fire that continued right through the day and was doused only after 7pm. The loss is estimated at Rs 40 lakh. Fire personnel helped save property worth Rs 60 lakh.

The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP), which manages the facility, said that a call was made to the fire services at 6.50am. CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues said that it is suspected that the fire started much earlier, in the early hours, but as the security guard was missing there was no one to alert the fire authorities on time.

“We are taking the matter up with the security agency. We were forced to take this agency by a government circular. We will now review these arrangements. We complained to Panaji police and the security guard is being questioned over whether there was any sabotage or aspects related to this, which need to be investigated into by the police,” Rodrigues told reporters.

Mayor Uday Madkaikar said an emergency number was given to the security guard in the event of a fire. “If it was seen on time then it would have been put out,” he said.

Fire personnel on arriving had to cut open the locked gate. Till noon 48,000 litres of water were used to douse the flames, which refused to die down due to the methane in the wet waste legacy dump at the site.

Sources said the CCP stopped the process of converting the wet waste into compost for around a year, resulting in the legacy dump being created.

“Waste of the past one-and-a-half month has been excessive due to back-to-back events in the city, right from the International Film Festival of India, Serendipity, New Year and Lokotsav. The waste has increased tremendously. We are working under tremendous pressure to treat this waste and we need this facility to be up and running,” Rodrigues said.

The corporation was aware of methane generation due to excessive heat these days and it was taking measures, Rodrigues said.

Waste from the site was being moved to other decentralised facilities in Panaji, he said.

The facility at Patto, which is managed by the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP), handles around 30 tonne wet waste daily, which is collected from commercial establishments, including hotels, restaurants and guesthouses. CCP sends 10 tonnes of wet waste to the plant at Saligao every day.

“Now that we have got the environment clearance (EC) for the Bainguinim plant, we appeal to the government to complete all the other formalities,” Madkaikar said.

Last year, major fires had broken out at the Sonsoddo and Taleigao garbage dumps, which raged on for days.

When asked about the cause of the fire, CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues said an enquiry is on by the fire services and police. “We would not go into the cause of the fire as we are working to prevent further escalation of the fire. We will wait for leads to come from the fire and police,” he said.

Delhi high court (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Monday sought the stand of Aam Aadmi Party government and Delhi Police, along with social media entities like WhatsApp, Google and Apple, on a plea by three professors from Jawaharlal Nehru University seeking to preserve data, CCTV footage and other evidence relating to the January 5 campus violence.

On its part, Delhi Police informed the court it had asked the JNU administration to hand over the CCTV footage of the violence, but was yet to receive any response from the varsity.

Justice Brijesh Sethi issued notice and listed the matter for Tuesday after being informed by standing counsel Rahul Mehra that police force had written to the varsity for preserving footage of 135 CCTVs installed in the premises. Mehra informed the court that police is taking steps to preserve evidence, including footage, and has sought from the administration the footage between January 3 and January 6.

The cops also communicated with WhatsApp to preserve data, including messages, pictures, videos and phone numbers of members of two groups — ‘Unity Against Left’ and ‘Friends of RSS’ — on the social networking platform on which the attack was allegedly coordinated.

The court is hearing a plea filed by Ameet Parameswaran, Atul Sood and Shukla Vinayak Sawant seeking directions to Delhi Police commissioner and the state government to ensure there is no damage to CCTV footage.

Senior advocates Rebecca John and Akhil Sibal, appearing for the academics, sought an urgent interim relief in the form of a direction that WhatsApp preserve the data of the groups as the administrators of these groups could delete material evidence. The court, however, said it can pass an order only after hearing the parties for which it issued notice seeking the stand of the three entities.

However, police neither responded to such requests nor did it reach out to them, despite clear and cogent material provided to the investigating agency, the plea claimed.

Visakhapatnam: Jana Sena ’s flag will fly high in the upcoming local body elections, party state general secretary T Siva Sankara Rao said on Monday.

Speaking to the media alongside Bolisetty Satyanarayana (general secretary - environment), Sanakara Rao took a dig at the erstwhile TDP government as well as the YSRC government. “Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy made tonnes of false promises before the elections. But now the people of Andhra Pradesh have realised that Reddy could not deliver the promises. False police cases are foisted against those questioning the misdeeds of the YSRC government and its inability to fulfil promises,” said Rao.

Rao further alleged that the chief minister created rivalry amongst the three regions of Andhra Pradesh by his “cheap trick” of proposing three capitals. “It seems that he is not even satisfied with it and is encouraging his party leaders to use abusive and foul language against Jana Sena president Pawan Kalyan. Even after attacking Jana Sena leaders and activists in Kakinada on Sunday, they tied to book police cases under section 307 on women leaders of Jana Sena. Kakinada MLA slandered Pawan Kalyan, but police did not register any case against the MLA and they allowed the MLA to use his goons to attack Jana Sena cadre with sticks and rods,” alleged Rao.

305,['14/01/2020'],NCW notice to TN college for expelling four girl students who consumed liquor,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Chennai: In the wake of a complaint against expelling four girl students of a college for consuming beer during a house party in Nagapattinam district, National Commission for Women (NCW) has issued a notice to the college asking it “to look into the matter and take appropriate action as per law”.

In a letter to the principal of Dharmapuram Adhinam Arts College in Mayiladuthurai , Shyamala S Kundar, member of the commission, citing the complaint by All India Private Colleges Employees Union (AIPCEU) which alleged harassment/indecent representation of women, said, “The action taken in the matter may please be communicated within 30 days from the date of receipt of the letter.”

The students in college uniform were seen celebrating the birthday of one of the girls at her house in Sitharkadu village. The incident came to light when a clip of the celebration was circulated on social media. After disciplinary enquiry, the college administration expelled all four students.

“The punishment is severe and it could end their education. Instead of reforming the students with lighter punishment, the college has taken an extreme step which has jeopardised their future. It amounts to harassment of women,” said K M Karthik, founder of AIPCEU and the complainant. He said the commission is considerate of the fate of the girls and sought a reply within 30 days.

“The entire matter was blown out of proportion. If boys drink and socialise it wouldn’t be an issue at all. It only became an issue as girl students consumed drinks. It was not done on the premises of college for it to take action,” said Sudha Ramalingam, senior advocate and social activist. “This is not the way to treat the students. The college could have reformed and educated them on the evils of drinking. But, to expel them is too harsh a punishment and it’s not for any educational institution to handle students like this. Students should be handled with compassion, caution and care. The intervention of national commission for women is good enough,” she said.

306,['14/01/2020'],"Too many inmates, too little staff in state jails","This story is from January 14, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Andhra Pradesh prisons are understaffed by at least 24 per cent and central prisons in the state are overcrowded by 10 per cent. The problem of overcrowding in central prisons in the state continues to persist, as per the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data on prisons in India 2018.

Andhra Pradesh has four central prisons at Vizag, Rajahmundry, Nellore and Kadapa, which together held 4,212 prisoners in 2018 — 4,049 male and 163 female (both convicts and under-trials) with an occupancy rate of 110.44 per cent against its capacity of 3,814. In 2017, the four central jails in the state had 4,690 prisoners and 4,126 in 2016.

The overall occupancy rate in all the jails (central jails, sub-jails, district jails, women’s jails, open jails, altogether 105 jails) in Andhra Pradesh is 79.5 per cent in 2018. A total of 6,988 prisoners, including 414 female inmates were in various prisons in the state against its capacity of 8,786.

Superintendent of Vizag Central Prison S Rahul said convicts account for 40 per cent of central jail population, while undertrials and remand prisoners’ account for 60 per cent. Over 2,370 convicts were lodged in the central jails and a few other jails in the state. A majority of the convicts (1,574) were sentenced in murder cases while 163 had committed rape.

Senior advocate K Muralidhar said some undertrial prisoners involved in ganja transportation and a few other cases were struggling to get bail due to various reasons and so were stuck in prison.

Members of Visakhapatnam Bar Association (VBA) said overcrowding in the jails is also a violation of human rights as it is the responsibility of the government to provide reasonable space in the prisons.

Apart from over-crowding in prisons, staff shortage of staff at all levels of the system too is a cause for concern.

As per National Crime Records Bureau, the sanctioned staff strength in state prisons in 2018 was 2,646, but the actual strength was 1,997 (649 vacancies).

File photo used for representational purpose

NEW DELHI: Members of JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) on Monday met the MHRD officials and reiterated their demand about the revocation of hostel fee hike and the ouster of vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar from his position.

The JNUTA presented to the MHRD a dossier on the alleged “misgovernance of JNU under the VC and explained how the incidents of January 5 were the culmination of the long history of such misgovernance.”

“An atmosphere of fear and insecurity prevails in the university, which cannot be removed as long as the VC continues to be the in-charge,” they claimed.

The teachers said that the mob violence targeted specific teachers and their families. “Teachers do not feel safe on the campus and fear that if the VC continues in office, we might witness in the days to come even worse than what was unleashed. It is not possible for teachers to pretend that things are normal and start regular activities on the directives of a VC and an administration in whom they have absolutely no faith.” The dossier also drew attention of the ministry towards a ‘public inquiry’ conducted in October 2017 “where comprehensive evidence had been presented on seven different charges against the VC. These covered violations of statutory provisions, undermining the integrity of the faculty selection process, gross errors in admission processes leading to massive seat cuts, harassment of teachers and denying them their rights, among others.”

JNUTA said the MHRD has promised to consider the views and concerns of the association and to continue the discussion with it. “The JNUTA can only express hope that there will be a speedy resolution of its concerns.”

MHRD officials said that they met the JNUTA members “and had a meeting with them where the latter raised their past concerns about the VC. We were under the impression that the strike will be called off as discussed in the previous meetings, but we heard that the strike has been called back again. We hope that the situation normalises in the campus.”

CHENNAI: Don’t forget to carry your mask when you step out for a morning walk on Tuesday as the city burns waste, including tyres and plastic, to celebrate Bhogi. Experts say pollution level, particularly PM2.5, is likely to be more than double the normal levels.Besides leaving people sick, smoke from fires could delay flights and increase road accidents. On the day of Bhogi in 2019, although the pollution levels were nearly three times the normal in some areas, the average pollution levels across the city were less compared to the same day in 2018. “Awareness messages and drive against plastic were largely responsible for decline in pollution levels in 2019,” said Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board chairman A V Venkatachalam.Track the pollution level in your cityThis year, with plastic back in most households, the levels of pollution could be higher. “We have made all attempts to stop it through awareness campaigns,” he said. Posters urging people to avoid burning waste were put up in 25 places across the city. “We expect a smoke free Bhogi in 2020,” he added.The board has also been working with AAI, Chennai corporation and IMA to spread awareness on the ill effects of burning waste, he said.However, environmental activists said adequate preventive programmes haven’t been initiated. “They arrested people who burst cracker on Diwali. Why can’t they do the same with people who burn tyres and other substances that release carcinogenic substances,” asked K Swetha, who volunteers for Exnora.City doctors, meanwhile, have geared up for crowded out-patient clinics. Pollution increases risk of hospitalisation for people with lung diseases. Pulmonologists like Dr Raj B Singh of Apollo Hospitals encourage morning walkers and pet owners to continue their brisk walks but they warn against intense activities that makes people gasp for air.Studies have shown that when levels of pollution spike, so does the number of deaths, including those from heart failure, asthma and lung diseases. Researches have shown that air pollution may adversely affect birth weight. A recent study done by researchers at the Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research showed that birth weight comes down by 4g when pregnant women are exposed to per 10 microgram /m3 change in particulate matter 2.5 (tiny particles that easily enter airways in the lungs).",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73237772,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-786230,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pollution-level-set-to-soar-this-bhogi/articleshow/73236377.cms

Chennai: Tamil Nadu has received an award from the Centre for ‘Best Performance in Road Safety’. Defence minister Rajnath Singh presented the award to state transport minister M R Vijayabaskar on Monday.

The state witnessed a 32% drop in road accident deaths in 2018, compared to the previous year, according to official data. This was after topping India’s state-wise accident chart twice in a row in 2016 and 2017.

The government attributed the decrease to coordinated efforts by various departments and regular reviews by State Road Safety Council headed by Nithin Gadkari, Union road transport and highways minister (MoRTH).

Besides strict enforcement by police in terms of wearing helmets, seatbelts and monitoring patrol vehicles, strengthening emergency care by establishing more trauma care centres, ambulances and responder bikes helped in bringing down deaths.

“Phenomenal levels of commitment by the health team and the introduction of emergency mobile app capturing GPS & GIS for reaching the accident spot faster have also helped in reducing response time,” said a MoRTH official.

Speaking to the media after the award ceremony, Vijayabaskar said it’s impossible to reduce accidents overnight and efforts will continue to cut fatalities further in 2019-20. Nearly one-third of road accidents are reported on national highways.

“Identifying and eliminating black-spots, installing speed-breakers and signage at such accident-prone stretches have drastically reduced the fatalities in the last three years,” said a National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) official.

Plans are underway to install automated number plate recognition systems and speed monitoring cameras along highway stretches for better compliance with road safety rules. A pilot project is expected to come up on Chennai-Trichy highway.

As far as Chennai was concerned, a major change introduced in 2017-18 was the e-challan system. Fines collected digitally were linked to the government database ‘VAHAN’ and it helped in nabbing repeat offenders, said traffic police.

Panaji: Parking provisions at D B ground were inadequate for the large number of visitors attending the 10-day Lokotsav . Traffic police had to shut access to the ground for cars on Monday evening due to lack of space.

Traffic police and wardens managed the flow of traffic on D B Road and after complaints from residents and local corporator Soraya Pinto Makhija, they stopped vehicles parking inside residential lanes and on the footpath. Traffic police put up no parking signs and erected barricades preventing cars and bikes from obstructing the smooth flow of traffic.

Mayor Uday Madkaikar said the parking provisions at D B ground are insufficient and not enough to cater to 200 four-wheelers as shown in the organisers parking plan.

The corporation is yet to issue permission to the festival, he said, adding that the toilet provisions are also not enough to cater to the vendors from 900-odd stalls and visitors.

Traffic wardens are stopping people from parking inside lanes opposite the festival after an ambulance couldn’t reach a patient at Landscape Pinto Park during the festival last year.The patient had to be carried up to the ambulance on the main road.

Makhija, in a letter to the corporation, had requested that all exhibitions especially 10-day festivals be held outside city limits where there is ample parking space and where residents will not be inconvenienced.

Visakhapatnam: With over 50% of fishing boats staying idle for the past one month due to low availability of catch, seafood lovers will soon likely have to spend more money at restaurants for their favourite dishes.

Usually the fishing harbour remains busy between November and March as it is the peak fishing season. But, in recent times a decline in the availability of catch in the Bay of Bengal has affected business.

Speaking to TOI, president of Dolphin Boat Operators’ Welfare Association, Ch Satyanarayana Murthy, said “This fishing season has not been encouraging.

Of the over 700 fishing boats in Visakhapatnam, more than 380 boats are anchored at the jetties. And it seems the situation is not likely to change before the annual fishing ban kicks in. The boat-owners are in no position to bear the losses.”

“We have to invest at least Rs 2.5 lakh for each voyage, which involves ice, diesel, food grains and labour charges among other inputs, lasting for 15 days. However most of the boat owners have incurred losses between Rs 50,000 to Rs 70,000 for each voyage due to low availability of export quality fish and prawn and high input cost,” said M Ramu, said a boat owner.

Some of popular variety of fishes, which have witnessed a price rise, include, seer fish (konam in local parlance) and silver pomfret (Chanduva). Silver pomfret or white pomfret, which is a species of butterfish, costs around Rs 1,200 a kg and that of Seer (konam) is Rs 800 or more depending on its size. The price of tiger prawn has increased to Rs 1,200 per kg from Rs 1,000 a kg, a buyer said.

TimesView While shunning plastic for steel boxes is a welcome gesture, it is a small step in the big battle against the global plastic crisis. The problem needs to be approached from all angles. Manufacturers should stop making plastic and users should be directed to eco-friendly alternatives. A major educational campaign needs to be undertaken on campuses to make sure everybody understands how plastic is choking the earth.

Rush for sugarcane, sweet potato and fresh turmeric

Festive makeover for reusable boxes

BENGALURU: The ban on single-use plastic and awareness created about its environmental impact are being felt this Sankranti , with many women seeking steel alternatives for distributing ellu-bella mixture.While plastic boxes are colourful and affordable, there are many who have switched to steel dabbas and cotton pouches to pack the tasty Sankranti mixture. Wholesale merchants of stainless steel products said the demand for small steel boxes has risen; they are available from Rs 30-Rs170 per piece, depending on the size.The festival is celebrated with ellu-bella (sesame-jaggery, groundnut, coconut mixture), sugarcane and fruits, as samples of harvest reaped and shared among friends and relatives.Bharat Singh, a wholesale dealer from Avenue Road, said plastic is no longer preferred to pack food products. Rupali Itgumpalli, a homemaker from Hebbal, prefers steel boxes. “As a custom I give the Sankranti mixture to 13 women and prefer steel to plastic boxes as steel lasts longer,” Rupali said.Vikas Jain, proprietor of M Bhawarlal’s Inc, member of a wholesale steel merchants’ association, said: “Many buyers prefer steel over plastic boxes/pouches. Many are making a conscious choice to stop using plastic products,” he added. However, for many like Sadashivanagar resident Anupama Harish, what matters is ellu-bella than the container. “It is more of packaging these days than the content inside. Butter paper pouches are cheap and best as they are also compostable. What matters is the sesame-jaggery mixture,” she says.On the streets of Malleswaram market, Gandhi Bazaar and DVG Road, many shops are selling cloth bags/pouches and cane baskets for the harvest festival.Markets in the city were bustling with festive shoppers ahead of Sankranti.

315,['14/01/2020'],High-level panel in midst of finalising safeguards to protect identity and heritage of Assamese people,"This story is from January 14, 2020

NEW DELHI/GUWAHATI: Even as protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act continue in Assam, a high-level committee is in the midst of finalising measures and initiatives to provide constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to protect the identity and heritage of the Assamese people, as required by Clause 6 of Assam Accord.

The committee, headed by Justice (Retd) Biplab Kumar Sharma, on Monday met home minister Amit Shah to discuss issues related to its charter or terms of reference. It is said to have briefed him on the deliberations of the committee so far and its plans ahead.

“We have apprised the home minister about the progress of our work. The home minister has given a few suggestions. We hope to submit our final report within next 15 days,” Sharma told reporters here.

The committee with more than a dozen members was set up as per the Clause 6 of the 1985 Assam Accord. The committee’s charter is to provide constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards, as may be appropriate, to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.

According to its terms and conditions, the committee is tasked with assessing the appropriate level of reservation of seats in Assam legislative assembly and local bodies for the indigenous people. It is also expected to recommend the appropriate level of reservation in employment under the government of Assam for the Assamese people.

Asked whether the panel could finalise the “definition of Assamese”, the retired judge said they were yet to take a decision on it and hope to come to a conclusion soon. “All members of the committee will soon meet to finalise the report and all remaining issues to be resolved,” he said.

The base date for defining an Assamese has been the most contentious and difficult part over the years. In 2015, former assembly speaker Pranab Kumar Gogoi had suggested in the House that 1951 be taken as the basis for the definition of Assamese, but that did not get to see light of the day. Few suggest that the definition of an Assamese is hidden in the contents of the Accord itself. According to the Accord, “For purposes of detection and deletion of foreigners, 1.1.1966 shall be the base data and year.” It says, “Foreigners who came to Assam after 1.1.1966 (inclusive) and up to 24th March, 1971 shall be detected in accordance with the provisions of the Foreigners’ Act, 1946 and the Foreigners’ (Tribunals) Order 1964 and their names will be deleted from the electoral rolls in force for a period of 10 years after which their voting rights will be restored. All others who came to Assam on or after March 25, 1971, will be expelled as illegal foreigners.”

The meeting took place four days after Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal met the home minister and discussed with him various aspects of the Assam Accord's Clause 6, under which the central government had promised to provide constitutional safeguards to the indigenous people.

The committee is said to have completed its deliberations and discussions with various stakeholders in Assam.

All Assam Students’ Union chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharya said, “The constitutional safeguards are our right, which are long due, for taking the burden of lakhs of illegal Bangladeshi migrants from 1951 to 1971 (Accord cutoff date). But we will never accept the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.”

CHENNAI: A 2-year-old child who was sleeping with her mother at MGR Central railway station on Sunday night has gone missing. Police suspect the child might have been taken away by a friend of the woman’s third husband.\

Investigation officers have identified the suspect through CCTV camera footage from the station. The complainant, Marjina, 21, recognized the man from the video as her third husband’s friend.

The man had been roaming around at the station for the past five days.

A police team led by Chennai Central railway station inspector Thomas Yesudasan is tracking the suspect to rescue the child and nab the kidnapper. The team has collected the suspect’s photograph from the CCTV camera footage and circulated to all police WhatsApp groups.

Investigation officers said the kidnapper would return soon with the abducted child as he stays at a platform and doesn’t have a house in the city. The police team is searching the roadside dwellings and conducted combing operation to nab the accused whose name, as told by Marjina’s husband, is Rasheed.

Police said Marjina married Azhar Ali five years ago and the couple had two daughters, Ajitha and Rejitha. Later, she separated from Azhar Ali and started staying with another man. They later married. She stayed with her two daughters.

However, Marjina didn’t continue her relationship with her second husband. She soon married Hameed. The couple started living at a platform near Chennai Central railway station with her two daughters. Hameed, who worked as a coolie, introduced his friend Rasheed to Marjina five days ago. He often met her in the absence of Hameed.

Marjina has claimed that Rasheed demanded she live with him and proposed to her several times. She refused to accept his proposal.

Investigation officers said Rasheed might have kidnapped Marjina’s daughter Rejitha. Further investigations are on.

Panaji: Old Goa locals along with panchayat members of Carambolim were up in arms on Monday after dozens of CCP trucks were found dumping what looked like wet waste and burnt garbage in a private property at Old Goa, close to a private hospital.

The incident came just hours after CCP’s waste treatment plant at Patto in Panaji caught fire .

Angry residents immediately protested at the site and stopped the trucks even as others rushed to the Old Goa Police station.

Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar also rushed to the spot to pacify the locals. “It is not garbage. It is compost. A man has been purchasing fertilizer from us and he agreed to let us dump it in his property,” he said.

Residents said that an official complaint will be filed with the Carambolim panchayat with a demand for action to be taken against the plot owner for allowing waste to be dumped in his property.

“Local residents told us that there is a water tank close to that place and wells,” local Samir Volvoikar said.

Madkaikar said that CCP was ready to shift the waste if the garbage began to emit a stench.

Thiruvananthapuram: Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar on Monday called on the people protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and subsequent introductions like National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and National Population Register ( NPR ) to work together to build a nationwide resistance.

Patkar, who inaugurated the anti-CAA rally organised by the Kerala Samsthana Janakeeya Prathirodha Samithi at Gandhi Park on Monday evening, said she is proud of the students who are refusing to give up their battle against the ‘unconstitutional’ bill.

“Protests against NRC should not be confined to the National Register of Citizens, rather we should be ready to uphold a national resistance against communalism, capitalism, casteism and corruption of all forms ...Whenever an administration uses force against its own people, it betrays fear. The present administration is not even ready for dialogue. Not even a single meeting or a dialogue with other political parties was considered before the implementation of such an amendment,” she said.

Patkar said she is proud of the people resisting and protesting against the enactment of the controversial bill. “Even as Amit Shah claims to have already implemented the Act, people from various sections have risen in protest. It is unfortunate that someone who swears by the Constitution of India comes up with an Act that disrupts the entire democratic framework of our nation. They want all the people to stand in their courts and prove their citizenship. I salute the brave youth of our nation and under your leadership we are ready to move forward. I am proud of the women who have come forward. They have shaken patriarchy, caste and communal creeds,” she said.

Chennai: Books on self-motivation and time management are selling like hot cakes at the ongoing book fair in Nandanam. Working professionals and entrepreneurs search for books of leading international and Indian authors.

Distributors and publishers observed that attitude, leadership, self-development, public speech and time management are the popular subjects among those looking for titles on motivation. V Kiran of a book distribution agency that has set up a stall at the fair said about 65% of titles in English were on self-motivation. “It has been the trend in the past and we are witnessing the same this year as well,” he said. While almost every stall selling English books has a considerable number on self-motivation, Tamil publishers have books penned by leading authors and civil servants.

V Surya of a publishing firm said employees mostly from IT firms are looking for books on time management. “Some specify this subject. During the four days, about 25% of books sold from our stall were on managing time,” he said.

IT employees stressed that such titles are required to improve their skills to establish their position in the competitive field. T S Ananth, an employee with a leading software company, who was spotted that the book fair on Monday said time management was essential in their profession. “Work pressure could drive employees to explore these books to improve their performance even as demand from the human resources department is on the rise,” he said.

Some see these books as a tool to encourage themselves. Balachandar, a private school teacher from Puducherry, who is preparing for civil service examinations said he visited the fair only to buy motivational books. “My peer groups are discouraging. But, these books are refreshing and enhance my confidence to fulfill my dreams,” he added.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: ABVP has demanded that Delhi Police’s inquiry into the violence on JNU campus be expanded to cover incidents from October 28 last year when the students’ strike against the hike in hostel fees was first called.

Addressing mediapersons at Press Club on Monday, ABVP released eight videos that purportedly showed the involvement of students affiliated to the Left in the violence that broke out on the campus on January 5. “ABVP has submitted all raw video evidence to police and demanded a fair and detailed inquiry into the chain of incidents starting from October 28. We categorically demand strict punishment to all those found guilty of violence,” Nidhi Tripathi, ABVP national general secretary, said.

ABVP has sought to highlight that the campus was simmering with tension much before the actual violence broke out. “The Left abused the sentiments of the students. For the last two and a half months, classes have been disrupted at JNU. The Left is not allowing exams to take place. Most unfortunately, students were attacked when they tried to register for the next semester,” Siddarth Yadav, Delhi state secretary of ABVP, said.

Among the students named by ABVP in the violence were Aparajita D Raja, daughter of CPI leader D Raja, and Amutha Jaydeep. The outfit also put on display some videos that it had released earlier to again name JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, its general secretary Satish Yadav, AISA activist Chunchun Kumar, Dolan Samanta and Geeta Kumari.

Raja and Jaydeep, who are seen together in the video, dismissed the allegations, saying ABVP was trying to change the narrative of the violence to portray it as a “clash”. Raja said: “The video is only of six seconds and it shows Jaydeep carrying a stick and throwing it away. ABVP is, as usual, lying and distorting (facts). One thing is clear — the violence was planned, provoked and carried out by ABVP.”

Jaydeep added: “I have seen the video... What happens before and after it has not been shown. Has anybody’s head been broken because of me? During a march from T-point towards Periyar, they (ABVP members) started throwing stones. We were trying to figure out what was happening. When I saw a person with a stick, I snatched it from him and threw it away.”

The others named by ABVP have already dismissed the allegations.

Aurangabad: The tendency among some farmers to excessively irrigate agricultural land came under sharp criticism.

“Make it a point to irrigate only crops. The practice of ‘flood irrigation’ — that irrigates entire farms — is bound to reduce yield and cause loss of water,” said U P Singh, Union secretary for the water resources ministry.

Addressing farmers at a special workshop, he said drip and micro-irrigation, along with sprinkler technology, should be adopted by every farmer. “Different water resources, including underground water, are depleting rapidly due to an increase in consumption. Agricultural irrigation accounts for around 89% of water use in country. The remaining 11% is for drinking requirements and industrial use. It is time to develop adequate water literacy,” he said.

Union minister of state for water resources Rattan Lal Kataria pointed out that compared to China, Brazil and the US, India consumes at least 2-3 times more water.

Panaji: Citizens will soon learn if they must pay higher penalties for traffic violations under the new amended Motor Vehicle Act as the state cabinet is set to take a decision on it. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho said that after the cabinet takes a decision, the transport department will implement the amended act.

Godinho had said that the amended act, which has provisions to impose higher penalties for traffic violations, will be implemented from January 2020. “I have left it to the wisdom of the cabinet about what we should do. Whether to lower the rates or go as per the original proposal of the new M V Act which are higher,” he told TOI. “The proposal will be placed before the next cabinet,” he added.

He also said that three states, including Gujarat and Uttarakhand, had lowered the rates, after which the Union government approached the attorney general of India for an opinion. He added that the attorney general of India gave a very strong opinion and said that states have no power to bring change in central acts and they have to implement the act in its original form.

Godinho said that the attorney general’s opinion also stated that the Union government has power under the Constitution to direct states to implement central acts.

While the legislation has come into force in other parts of the country, the Goa government deferred its enforcement after the public raised a hue and cry over the terrible road conditions across the state.

Chandigarh-Manali highway was blocked at Aut after a landslide

MANALI: Thousands of people, including tourists, were left stranded due to a landslide near Aut in Mandi district of Himachal blocked Chandigarh-Manali national highway at about 2pm on Monday afternoon. The incessant rain triggered landslides in Mandi and Kullu districts along the national highway -- which has seen huge mountain cutting for its widening – with huge boulders rolling down on the highway making driving very risky.

As all attempts to resume traffic movement failed till night, Mandi administration and police have decided to keep highway closed for the night and reopen it in the morning. A large number of tourist vehicles including nearly 40 tourist buses that left Manali for Delhi have also stuck on both sides of the landslide. The vehicles are now being stopped at Mandi and Kullu. Unfortunately, the bypass road via Kandi-Katola is also blocked with snow.

The whole mountain face near Aut has been sliding down for over a year now with boulders lying along the highway but authorities are not clearing them. Neither have the authorities cautioned travellers.

Mandi SP Gurdev Chand Sharma said the highway had got blocked at Banala near Aut following a landslide. “Machines were moved to the spot. Police were informed that it will take nearly two hours to clear the debris. Police are present at the spot to ensure public safety,” he said.

The Aut-Sainj road that was blocked due to flood in Pagal nullah on Sunday was again rendered impassable on Monday. The road is being maintained by a hydel project management and residents allege that the area is being ignored and no machines are deployed to clear the debris unless the hydel unit vehicles get stuck there.

Mahesh Sharma, a resident of Sainj village, said hundreds of villages get cut-off after floods in the Pagal nullah. “Nobody cares for our plight. This nullah brings tonnes of debris in any season and blocks road, apart from posing a threat to our lives. Government should find a permanent solution to this problem,” he said.

Kullu police on Monday night received information that a vehicle fell into the Beas on Manali-Kullu bypass road, but neither did they find any vehicle, nor did they receive any casualty report. But search was being conducted till late night with help of search lights.

VALPOI: Days after the arrest of four men from the Dhangar community in Dongurli-Thane, Sattari, for the death of four tigers, the village panchayat on Monday demanded that medical facilities and police protection be provided to their families. The Dhangars belong to the Scheduled Tribe community.

Sarpanch of Dongurli-Thane Prajita Gawas, who visited the Dhangar families along with other panchayat members, submitted a memorandum to the deputy collector of Sattari Mangaldas Gaonkar requesting him to help them.

Since the arrest of the four men, who were the heads and sole earning members of the two families living there, the women and children find themselves without income and security.

“In one house there is an 80-year-old woman who is very ill, in another there is a girl suffering from high fever. However, without the men of the family they find it difficult to seek medical treatment,” Gawas said.

Panch Nilesh Parwar said that as the community lives in the midst of a forest, they are always exposed to danger and with no male members to protect them “children have stopped going to school for the past few days”. One child had to skip her Class XII preliminary examination, he said.

Making a case for the Dhangar families, the panchayat members urged the deputy collector to look into the plight of the families.

Deputy collector Mangaldas Gaonkar heard the grievances of the panchayat members and assured them that he would look into the matter. He ordered health and police officials to provide the Dhangar families with assistance.

On Monday evening a team of health officers visited the families. “Our team examined all members of the two families. Four people had fever. We gave them medication and took their blood samples for investigation,” said health officer Dr Gajanan Naik.

“We advised the daughter-in-law of one aged, bed-ridden patient to admit her in hospital but she refused saying she has no one to stay with her mother-in-law in hospital,” Naik said, adding that the woman has a daughter and cannot leave her behind alone while she accompanies her mother-in-law to hospital.

“We gave her some medicine and asked her to report to us about her mother-in-law’s health status,” he said.

Aurangabad: Chief Minster Uddhav Thackeray has issued a directive to the municipal commissioner and the divisional commissioner to looking for a dedicated officer to implement the Smart City project in the city

Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel had demanded an officer due to the slow progress of the project.

MP Jaleel, who is also a member of the urban development committee of the central government, have repeatedly expressed concerns at different levels about the slow pace of works under the project in Aurangabad.

As per the letter given by him for the chief minister’s meeting held on January 9, Jaleel said that of the 100 smart cities selected in India, Aurangabad is amongst the worst 20 mainly due to the delay in the utilisation of funds. “Of the Rs 290 crore funds available under the project, only Rs 61 crore has been utilised so far,” Jaleel said.

He said that the Aurangabad municipal commissioner has to take care of other civic issues cannot give enough time as the CEO of Smart City project SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) i.e. Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Ltd. (ASCDCL).

“The chief minister has directed municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey and divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar to look for an officer who will enthusiastically work for the Smart City project. He will be appointed as the additional CEO of ASCDCL,” Jaleel told TOI.

Therefore, the MP has asked the CM to appoint a dedicated additional CEO for the Smart City project, who will work only for the project.

Aurangabad: The residents of Pundalik Nagar, led by local corporator Meena Gayke, locked the gate of elevated storage reservoir (ESR) in the area on Monday after the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) delayed the supply of water and shut it after 15 minutes. The lock was opened only after the water supply was restored in about an hour.

Incidentally, the AMC supplies water to Pundalik Nagar ward from its ESR in Pundalik Nagar once in six days for 45 minutes. According to Gayke, the AMC delayed the supply of water on Monday.

“People had been waiting for water for five days and when the supply finally started, it was delayed by an hour. Moreover, the supply was stopped after 15 minutes. Some houses did not even receive water,” Gayke said.

The corporator along with the residents then stormed the ESR and locked its gate. “With the festival of Makar Sankrant on Tuesday, it was insensitive on the part of AMC to stop the water supply within 15 minutes. Therefore, people expressed dissent at their irresponsible move,” the corporator said.

Incidentally, the problem of contaminated water also persists in the area. In July 2019, the residents had held the civic officials hostage for four hours after no heed was paid to their repeated complaints of contaminated water. Subsequently, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele and the then municipal commissioner Nipun Vinayak had to intervene.

Asked about the matter, Raju Sandha, the head of water works department, said, “The water supply was interrupted because of a power cut at the ESR. However, we resumed the supply after electricity was restored.”

About contaminated water supply in the area, Sandha said that efforts are on to address the problem. “The drainage department and the water works department are carrying out civil works to solve the water contamination problem of Pundalik Nagar,” he said.

PANAJI: After setting up smart classrooms in government colleges, five more will get commerce and economics laboratories and four will get language labs, all at a total cost of approximately Rs 3 crore.

These labs will enable teachers to make use of open source educational software to make learning interesting.

Students will be able to play games through which they will learn workings of systems like share market dealings in the commerce and economics lab, officials of the directorate of higher education (DHE) said.

While the commerce and economics labs will come up in the government colleges in Quepem, Margao, Pernem, Khandola and Sakhali, the language labs will be established in the state institutes in Pernem, Khandola, Sakhali and Quepem.

The language lab will have content in Sanskrit, Marathi, Konkani and English, where students can use open source educational software to learn things like articulation, pronunciation, etc, with the help of animations. Vocabulary, for instance, can be improved using a flash card game, DHE deputy director Renji George Amballoor said.

“International standard modular work stations will be provided in the colleges to use the open source educational software. The work of establishing the labs will begin next month. With these labs we are empowering students as well as teachers. In economics, for instance, all the data sets will be available to teachers through these labs using which they can carry out further research,” DHE officials said.

Already, the state government has set up virtual and smart classrooms in government colleges in Quepem, Borda, Khandola and Sakhali at a cost of around Rs 4 crore. Officials said that work order has been issued to set up virtual and smart classrooms in the remaining three government institutes, officials said.

“The smart classrooms have equipment like high definition cameras. Once all colleges have the virtual and smart classrooms, one resource person will be able to deliver a lecture at one institute and it can be watched by students in all the government colleges. The students cannot only watch, but also interact using the equipment with the resource person,” Amballoor said.

Funds allotted by the central government under the Rashtriya Ucchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) were utilised to provide the virtual boards and smart classrooms.

331,['14/01/2020'],Group IV malpractice: Top rankers quizzed,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Chennai: Following allegations of malpractice in group IV exam, Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission ( TNPSC ) on Monday held an enquiry with more than 40 toppers who wrote the exam from centres in Rameswaram and Keelakkarai in Ramanathapuram district .

Some candidates said three committees quizzed them separately during the day. Candidates from outside the district but who wrote exams in Rameswaram and Keelakkarai were questioned by the committees on why they chose the centres.

TNPSC released the rank list for group IV exam recently. In the list, it was found that many candidates among the top 100 ranks wrote their exams in Rameswaram and Keelakarai. These candidates were allegedly from different districts but had still chosen to write the group IV exam from one of these centres.

A candidate near Chennai, who was called for enquiry, said she went to Rameswaram for the death ceremony of her child who had passed away a few months back, and wrote the exam there. Many candidates concealed their face while entering the TNPSC office to avoid media glare. The enquiry which began in the morning went on till evening.

Some candidates, who failed to qualify for the next round, were also called for enquiry. They were asked about suspicious activities at the exam centres on the day of the exam. When contacted, TNPSC officials said they can’t share information about the enquiry at this stage.

More than 13 lakh candidates appeared for the group IV exam conducted by the TNPSC at more than 5,500 venues across the state on September 1, 2019. The results were announced on November 12 last year, which was the shortest time taken for group IV exam.

Among the top 100 candidates, 35 were from two centres, raising suspicion on exam malpractice. TNPSC, while announcing that a detailed enquiry would be conducted into the allegations, acknowledged that of 57 candidates shortlisted from Rameswaram and Keelakkarai centres, 40 were from other districts. It also assured a fair probe into the allegations.

“It is not just group IV exam alone. Even in group II-A exam many candidates from these two centres got into the top 100. In group IV exam, the answer sheets were sent after a delay of one week. There could have been a nexus between exam officials and unscrupulous elements during the exam. TNPSC should probe all angles and should take strict action if it finds anyone had cheated in the exam,” said a trainer for competitive exams.

332,['14/01/2020'],Goa government seeks SC nod to start handling dumps,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: The state government on Monday approached the Supreme Court seeking permission to handle the ore dumps.

“An application for dump mining has been filed before the Supreme Court,” said chief minister Pramod Sawant. “We are hopeful of a positive outcome in reviving the industry.”

Mines director Ashutosh Apte told TOI that the application has been filed based on the SC-appointed central empowered committee report on dump handling. “We want the apex court to take a decision on the report, and accordingly we will come out with a dump policy and guidelines,” Apte said.

According to the concessionaires’ declaration, around 800 million tonnes of iron ore dumps are lying in the state, the expert committee report stated.

The CEC had recommended that the SC direct the state government not to carry out extraction of overburdened dumps outside approved mining lease areas till an environmentally sustainable scheme of mining for the removal of mineral from overburdened dumps was prepared. This scheme, the CEC said, would have to be considered along with relevant information regarding the ownership of the dumps and realistic assessment regarding mineral available (grade-wise) in such dumps. It would then have to be approved by the statutory authorities, the CEC said.

In November 2019, the state had filed a review petition in the Supreme Court against the February 2018 order suspending mining operations. The state had also prayed for fast-tracking the hearing in the matter.

Earlier, Sawant had said that a dump policy would be finalised by the end of January 2020.

Mining came to a halt in the state in March 2018, after the apex court quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases.

Waste management minister Michael Lobo had said that if dump is handled through a corporation, then the state treasury would benefit. Every month, the state government borrows money by selling security bonds. “If we auction the dumps, we will immediately get Rs 1,500 crore,” Lobo had said.

During the finance consultation meeting held by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Sawant said that the state lost around Rs 1,400 crore in revenue every year due to the stoppage of mining.

CM Ashok Gehlot

JAIPUR: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday said it was a matter of concern that the Centre was planning to seek another interim dividend from the RBI to meet its expenditure commitments and alleged that the NDA government was “completely ruining” the economy.

“Reports that the government is planning to seek another interim dividend from the RBI to meet its expenditure commitments is a matter of concern. The government took away a large amount from the RBI earlier, too,” Gehlot tweeted.

“The NDA government is completely ruining the economy even as common people are increasingly facing financial hardships,” he added.

According to news reports, the government has asked for an additional Rs 45,000 crore from the RBI as interim dividend to make up for its revenue deficit. It has been a major bone of contention between two former RBI governors and the government which resulted in their early exits.

The Union government had asked for Rs 1.76 lakh crore from the RBI as dividend to the Centre. Of this amount, Rs 1.48 lakh crore was given for the current financial year (2019-20).

According to the report, the RBI makes profits largely by trading currency and government bonds.

BENGALURU: Resident welfare associations around Doddakallasandra Lake in South Bengaluru on Monday filed an objection before the Karnataka Tank Conservation Development Authority ( KTCDA ) against the latter’s proposal to enter an MoU with a real estate firm to rejuvenate and develop the water body.

Residents fear that the realty firm would concretise and commercialise the biodiversity rich water body area. KTCDA is an umbrella body for the conservation and development of tanks in the state.

RWAs of Narayana Nagar 1st, 2nd and 3rd Blocks, Soudhamini Layout, Silicon City and New Bank Colony raised their concerns before KTCDA director Shiva Swamy, who told them that the MoU is yet to be signed and he would look into their concerns.

Though the 21-acre lake is rich in biodiversity, it is in need of rejuvenation as desilting, bund construction and other works need to be carried out.

The residents alleged that the firm in question is building a huge residential complex in the vicinity of the lake and untreated water is being released into the waterbody.

NR Somashekar, a resident of Narayan Nagar and secretary of the area’s RWA said, “We don’t want the lake area to be concretised in the name of development. Till now, we have ensured that not even a jogging track is built around the lake. On weekends we bring our children here to watch birds and butterflies . We need the lake to be rejuvenated as it has started stinking and become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. But it doesn’t mean that it should be handed over to a private builder.”

Raghavendra B, who resides close to the lake and is a member of Peoples' Campaign for Right to Water – Karnataka, said, “We want KTCDA to hand over the lake’s maintenance to the local custodian, in this case BBMP. If that is done, we can chip in with suggestions and other activities as we believe BBMP is more approachable.”

A representative of the real estate firm, however, refuted the charges that it was polluting the lake. “We have a 2,000 KLD sewage treatment plant within our premises and only treated water is being released into the lake,” she added.

A lake of butterflies

According to a report released by ActionAid Association, an NGO in December last, Doddakallasandra Lake is home to rich biodiversity including 70 species of birds and 37 species of butterflies besides rich flora. Tiny Grass Blue, one of the smallest species of butterflies, as well as Blue Mormon, which is one of the larger species are all found here. The Oriental Darter and Black Headed Ibis, two bird species which are in the Red List of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) are also found around the lake.

MANALI: Higher hills of Himachal received another spell of snow, while remaining parts were lashed by rain on Monday. Entire Lahaul valley received heavy snowfall and administration has ordered to close the schools for two days.

With some areas receiving heavy snowfall and white blankets of snow forming several layers, the Himachal Pardesh Disaster Management Authority has warned about avalanches in districts of Kullu and Lahaul-Spiti. Both the district administrations have asked people to stay alert.

Lahaul-Spiti district headquarter Keylong has received 60cm snow since Sunday evening. Koksar has received over 75cm snow. Solang, which was covered with nearly 75cm snow, has received 15cm more snow on Monday. Kalpa in Kinnaur also received 15cm more snow. Manali town received some traces of snow in the evening but snowfall had restarted in the late evening. The residents of Shimla city received some relief from slippery roads and pathways due to the rain but upper parts of the district received some snow.

The conditions are worst in Lahaul valley where all roads are blocked and electricity and phone networks have been crippled. The residents are hearing roaring sound of movement of snow avalanches but nobody can see them in almost zero visibility.

Keylong sub-divisional magistrate Amar Negi confirmed, “All roads are blocked and power supply is affected partially. The accumulation of blanket of snow on old hard snow has increased chances of avalanches. We have alerted residents to take extra precaution.”

Many roads in state were still closed due to recent snowfall and the fresh snowfall has again blocked more roads in the state. The electricity supply was crippled in Shimla, Kullu and Lahaul-Spiti.

According to Shimla meteorological centre director Manmohan Singh , the western disturbance that hit Western Himalayas on Sunday brought snowfall and rain to the state and another western disturbance is likely to hit the state on Wednesday. “The minimum temperature in the state has increased by 1 to 2 degrees C in last 24 hours. At minus 6 degrees C, Keylong was coldest in the state,” he said.

Administration has deployed machineries at main hot spots and will be working during night hours also to ensure all roads are kept open. All roads in Shimla city are open for vehicular traffic. As many as 25 various heavy machineries are on standby for clearance of roads.

Shimla to Theog road is open for light vehicles but has become slippery due to fresh snowfall near Fagu. The main road from Shimla to Chopal has been blocked again and while Shimla-Khadapathar opened for light vehicles but it is slippery at shady areas. Main road from Shimla to Rampur is open and Narkanda-Oddi is also clear but slippery. At most places, earth moving machines are busy clearing blocked roads.

Amit Bhaduri

NEW DELHI: Economist and Jawaharlal Nehru University professor emeritus Amit Bhaduri on Monday accused vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar of playing a pivotal role in “a larger and more sinister plan” of destroying the atmosphere of freedom of expression in the varsity. As a mark of protest, he returned the honour of emeritus professorship.

Mincing no words in his criticism of the JNU administration, Bhaduri in his letter to the vice-chancellor said, “I have learnt from friends and witnessed through public channels with alarm, and now with increasing disgust, how your handling of situations as the administrative and academic head of JNU has led to its steady deterioration paving the way for its intellectual disintegration.”

Bhaduri’s letter comes after 302 Indian and foreign academicians called for Kumar’s resignation in a signed statement that his position was untenable.

Saying it would be immoral on his part not to register his protest against “this larger, sinister scheme of throttling dissent unfolding at the university”, Bhaduri said that since his association with JNU from 1973, it had passed through various phases of justified or unjustified student unrest, competent or incompetent handling of situations by the administration, and even temporary shutdown of teaching.

However, Bhaduri said the present situation was different. “What is different now is not only incompetence of handling of situations by authorities, but a deliberate attempt to throttle the free atmosphere of debate and discussion for which JNU was known all over India. It was a matter of pride for its faculty and students that they were exposed to a whole range of ideas. This was something that did not happen anywhere else, and I would say from experience in very few academic institutions in the world,” he added.

Holding Kumar responsible for the current situation in the campus, Bhaduri said, “You seem determined on imprinting your administration’s narrow-minded worldview and shut other windows of ideas to the students, which you as the head of JNU also appear to be a pivotal part.”

The economist stated that returning the honour was purely symbolic as he and other emeritus professors “have already been locked out several months ago from the room allotted in JNU”.

“In practical terms, it means little. Yet, I do hope that my returning the honour that was bestowed on me by the university sends you the right message of my deep concern at your leadership, which is leading the premier institution of learning to its systematic disintegration,” Bhaduri added in his letter.

The JNU VC said: “I’ve not yet seen such a letter in my office. We appreciate contributions made by our emeritus professors. However, I wouldn’t like to comment on the merits of their decision.”

341,['14/01/2020'],Goa: Special cell to speed up pension papers of college teachers,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: The directorate of higher education (DHE) has formed a separate cell ‘ Sevarth ’ to help ready pension papers of teachers and staffers of Goa University and affiliated colleges on the last day of their service itself.

Officials found that there were many undue delays in processing pension papers of teachers and other staffers of the Goa University and the 34 government and aided colleges. Officials said that several complaints were also being received, with some matters going to court.

Starting from September 2018, the cell has started maintaining data of employees of GU and affiliated colleges set to retire in the coming four years. This helps officials of the cell to prepare the pension papers in advance.

“DHE is possibly the only government department with such a cell. Even across the country very few departments will have such cells. The cell employees’ job is to exclusively coordinate with the accounts department to ready the pension papers of those about to retire. On the last day of the employee, the director of higher education or his nominee, reaches the institute and hands over a memento and the pension papers to the retiring staffer,” said DHE official.

In June last year, the Goa Human Rights Commission had issued notices to the state director of accounts, director of education and state education secretary for delay in processing nearly cases of retired school teachers’ pension papers. The Goa government also initiated inquiry after reports of many pensioners, including teachers, waiting for their pensions for years.

Similarly, in 2017, a petition was filed with the Goa Human Rights Commission over the alleged suicide of a peon, who had retired from the High Court of Bombay at Goa, and had been struggling to get his pension papers cleared.

343,['14/01/2020'],Mock drills in schools prep students for emergencies,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ), in collaboration with the government of Japan and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ), is implementing a disaster preparedness project in municipal schools in the city.

The project, which has already covered nine schools in Vizag city and one school in Srikakulam district, aims to enhance tsunami preparedness and awareness in these institutions.

While the initiative in the ten schools focuses on tsunami preparedness under the ‘Partnership for strengthening school preparedness for tsunami in the Asia Pacific region’ project of the UNDP and the government of Japan, the ongoing project in other schools will cover all disasters.

The project extends support to the schools in preparing a disaster management plan and conducting mock evacuation drills. The GVMC has successfully completed mock drills on tsunami preparedness at all eight schools.

According to the GVMC officials, the project is currently being implemented in another 12 schools in the city. “The project will sensitise children and the school community on issues of disaster preparedness, life-saving skills and safety measures. As part of the programme, the schools will get a disaster management plan and committees including students will be formed. Students and teachers will be given practical guidance on evacuation drills and on preparing effective preparedness plans. Later, they will participate in mock evacuation drills. We are planning to replicate the initiative in all schools in the city,” said a GVMC official.

According to experts, factors such as rapid urbanisation, climate change and decreasing green cover have led to an increase in incidence of natural disasters, such as cyclones and intense storms. This in turn compounds the vulnerabilities of communities, particularly those living near the seashore. An effective preparedness plan and students and teachers trained in mitigation measures can minimise damage during a disaster, said officials of the civic body.

Meanwhile, the state school education department plans to make ‘school safety curriculum’ a part of the two-year diploma in elementary education. The curriculum is expected to help trainee teachers gain an understanding of school safety measures and translate into effective classroom training for students and make schools more resilient to disasters.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has dedicated 14 waste collection vehicles manned with a vigilance squad member to keep a check on roadside dumping across the city.

For door-to-door waste collection, the AMC has hired Bengaluru-based agency P Gopinath Reddy that is responsible for collecting waste from households from 6am to 12pm and from market areas, hotels and marriage halls from 6pm to 10pm.

According to the waste collection agency, it has 100% door-to-door coverage. However, the city still witnesses dumping of waste on roads by residents and commercial waste generators. Burning of waste at several locations is also a cause of concern.

The initiative has taken based on civic chief Astik Kumar Pandey’s instructions and is being held under the guidance of solid waste management head Nandkishore Bhombe.

According to sanitation inspector Vishal Kharat, maximum dumping of waste occurs during the evening hours. “The time for running the vehicle is decided based on the dumping. There are 8 vehicles from the airport to railway station route, 4 on Baba Petrol Pump to Harsul T Point route and 2 from Cidco Bus Stand to Harsul T-point road. These vehicles run on both sides of the road,” he said.

“The objective is to change the habit of the people who dump waste on roads. As soon as someone dumps waste on the road or is about to do so, the vehicle will catch them and the vigilance squad member on the vehicle imposes penalty for waste dumping,” he added.

Aurangabad: A mob comprising 70 to 80 people damaged the doors and windows of the medicine ward and allegedly attacked security guards at the Government Medical College Hospital (GMCH) on Monday after a patient died while undergoing treatment there.

According to Meenakshi Bhattacharya, head of the department of medicine at GMCH, a patient admitted to the hospital was diagnosed with high blood pressure and ischemic heart disease. “The patient’s condition became critical on Sunday. He was then shifted to the Intensive Coronary Care Unit (ICCU). We had informed the relatives that the patient was critical from the time he was admitted. His kidney functions were deranged and urination had stopped,” she said.

The doctors said the patient had a minimum of 15 people with him from the time of admission and this continued even after he was shifted to the ICCU. “At 3pm, the attending doctor informed me that the patient’s condition had deteriorated further, and 15 people had entered the ICU,” Bhattacharya said. “A few moments later, the patient passed away and the hospital declared him dead,” she added.

According to the hospital staff, around 70 to 80 people gathered in the corridor of the medicine ward and some of them started breaking the glass doors. “The mob tried to physically assault three-four security guards. One guard was even punched in the ear. The diagnosis and treatment of the patient were going on properly. The patient had stopped medication for the past one month, which had led to the deterioration of his condition. Relatives were informed about the condition from the beginning,” Bhattacharya said.

The mob broke three glass doors. The hospital administration said that they will seek compensation for the attack on security guards and damage to property.

Begumpura police station inspector Sachin Sanap told TOI: “The process of scanning footage from CCTV cameras installed in the ward is underway. Depending on the suspects’ role, we will book them under sections 353 of the Indian Penal Code, apart from relevant sections of the Prevention of Damage to Public Properties Act.”

Thiruvananthapuram: The Janata Dal (Secular) state unit will resume negotiations with the Loktantrik Janata Dal ( LJD ) regarding their proposed merger after January 17. The decision was taken at the JD(S) state committee meeting held here on Monday.

The meeting witnessed heated debates over the issue with a section of leaders raising doubts over lack of transparency in the process. According to sources, Thiruvananthapuram district committee chief Firoz Lal and Kannur district president P P Divakaran demanded transparency by taking into confidence district president and state committee members regarding the merger talks. Divakaran said all those who had taken the lead to form JD(S) when the party was split should be included in the talks. It was decided that the final decision would be taken only with the concurrence of the state committee.

State president C K Nanu told the leadership panel that a committee comprising minister K Krishnankutty, MLA Mathew T Thomas, A Neelalohitadas and him is leading the talks. He said MP Veerendra Kumar and MV Sreyams Kumar of LJD had already held discussions with JD(S) national president H D Deve Gowda. Krishnankutty told the committee that Gowda entrusted the panel to negotiate with LJD leadership when he met them at Kottakkal on December 24.

Sources said a few leaders also raised questions over the demand by LJD for eight district president posts. Leaders including Thomas said discussions should be transparent and JD (S) should demand more positions during merger.

The national leadership of JD(S) has asked state leadership to reach a consensus within the party and reach an agreement with LJD before submitting the merger formula to them.

Karti Chidambaram

CHENNAI: Multiple attempts made by counsel for former Union minister P Chidambaram’s son Karti Chidambaram and his wife in the Madras high court to stall income tax proceedings did not earn them any reprieve, as at least three different benches declined to offer any hearing.

It was a case of faux pas before Justice P Rajamanickam, where senior advocate K T S Tulsi made a mention and sought an urgent hearing of the pleas moved by Karti and his wife. The judge agreed to hear the case as lunch motion.

However, when Justice Rajamanickam commenced his hearing in the afternoon, Baskar and M Sheela, standing counsel for the tax department, raised several objections and said, “Even the crime numbers mentioned by the petitioners are incorrect. They must be amended first. Moreover, the cases are not pending before the additional chief metropolitan magistrate court in Egmore, as claimed. They are pending before the special court for cases against MPs and MLAs.”

Recording the submissions, Justice Rajamanickam wondered how the plea can he heard by him as he is not the portfolio judge. To this, senior counsel Nalini Chidambaram said they made a representation before the chief justice who directed the registry to list the matter before this court.

To this, Justice Rajamanickam asked: “If so, where is the order passed by the chief justice. Without such an order, how can I entertain the plea? The petition has been listed before this court since you made an urgent mention. I was not aware of the facts of the case. That apart, standing counsel for the department are raising several objections which have to be rectified.”

The court then directed the registry to post the matter before the chief justice to decide further course of hearing.

Then, Karti’s counsel again made a mention before Chief Justice S P Sahi’s bench seeking an urgent hearing on Monday, a day before the special court is scheduled to hear the plea. However, noting that he can’t take a decision without going into any note or order passed by Justice Rajamanickam, the chief justice asked counsel to make a representation to the registrar (judicial), who would forward it to the office of the chief justice for appropriate orders.

Earlier in the morning, Justice Anita Sumanth recused from hearing the plea moved by the two after Sheela and Baskar submitted that documents seized from Advantage Strategic Private Limited were the basis for the cases initiated against them and that the judge had represented the company when she was an advocate. Concurring with the submissions, Justice Anita Sumanth directed the registry to forward the plea to the chief justice for posting before another court.

The judge also turned down Tulsi’s submission that she should at least adjourn the matter till Monday with an interim injunction against the special court from framing charges.

MEERUT: Police force along with heavy contingent of Rapid Action Force (RAF) and Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) conducted raid in a minority-dominated area in the city to arrest Popular Front of India (PFI’s) west UP coordinator.

According to Lisari Gate circle officer Dinesh Shukla, “Tahir is an active member of extremist and Islamic fundamentalist organisation PFI. We had an intelligence input that he came back to Meerut after getting trained in Delhi to incite local population against CAA. He was also involved in the anti-CAA protests in Meerut on December 20 and was recognized from CCTV footages.”

The arrest was made on Sunday night from Lisari Gate area of Meerut city.

Notably, half a dozen members of PFI are already behind bars in Meerut and Shamli alone for their involvement in the recent anti-CAA violence. Out of these, four were from Shamli and two from Meerut. According to police sources, they had distributed controversial pamphlets in their respective areas. These pamphlets had allegedly incited local population to indulge in violent protests soon after Friday prayers on December 20.

At least 16 people had died in several districts of Uttar Pradesh when protests turned violent and clashes ensued between the protesters and police force. State police later claimed more than 250 cops were injured while 57 suffered gunshot wounds.

In fact, Uttar Pradesh police also said that PFI was actively involved in the recent violence. Uttar Pradesh DGP OP Singh said, “We have ample proof of their involvement. We arrested 25 PFI members for their negative role in the statewide protests, including state president Wasim. In fact, we have written to Union home ministry to ban this organisation.

According to police sources, PFI is successor to National Development Front, a Muslim organisation set up in Kerala in 1994 which merged with PFI in 2006. Since its inception, the organisation has been accused of various acts of religious extremism and is often seen as an offshoot of banned outfit Students Islamic Movement of India.

JAISALMER: Union minister of state for agriculture Kailash Choudhary visited the locust-affected areas in Barmer on Sunday and Monday and took stock of the situation.

He also met the farmers and assured all possible help. He said that the Centre had issued compensation for the farmers and arrangements have been made for machines and pesticides to stop locust attack in future. Centre was keeping a watch on the locust-affected areas.

Kisan Sangh tehsil president Ladhuram Vishnoi said that a lot of damage has been caused to crops due to locust attacks and farmers should be given special package. Farmers in Baytu said that locusts were continuously eating their crops and there was no arrangement to kill locusts sitting on trees.

Addressing the media in Barmer, Choudhary said that the state government did not get Girdawari done on time and the department employees too did not help in controlling locusts. He said that in Gujarat, the farmers got immediate relief. The government along with locust control department has made arrangements to destroy locusts. Choudhary said that small groups of locusts are present at 15-20 places in western Rajasthan that will be destroyed in next 2-3 days.

Aurangabad: Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey has issues directions to ensure that construction sites in the city are covered with net to prevent dust pollution. Pandey has also directed for appropriate disposal of construction and demolition waste. TOI had published a report on November 26 about the rampant violation of Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules,2016.

The city engineer has issued a letter to deputy commissioner and head of anti-encroachment department Ravindra Nikam, head of solid waste management cell Nandkishore Bhombe, ward engineers and ward officers of Zones 1 to 9 in this regard.

“Public notices have been issued in local newspapers to notify property owners and those involved in construction activities to put up a net at the sitesunder construction and take other necessary measures for dust mitigation. Action should be taken against those not following these directives,” the letter states. The city engineer has also sought a report for actions taken against the violators.

The letter also states that action should be taken against those using public spaces for storing or dumping construction material and debris. Incidentally, the city sees a significant number of constructions for personal and commercial purposes. The air quality action plan of Aurangabad submitted by the AMC to the Central Pollution Control Board recognizes the construction and demolition activities as major source of air pollution.

The failure of authorities to keep a check on the violators is hampering the city’s air quality and therefore proving hazardous to health. Homoeopathic practitioner Kishor Pathak had stated that the dust pollution is leading to cases of conjunctivitis, silicosis, allergic rhinitis and allergic pharyngitis.

The measures taken by AMC on dust mitigation has been welcomed by environment experts. Pathak said though a lot needs to be done, the step taken by the civic body is a good beginning to control pollution.

Nashik: A section of farmers on Sunday opposed giving their land for the proposed Greenfield township project to be developed under the Town Planning scheme by the Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL).

Around 400 farmers have opposed the Greenfield project. Some of these farmers met on Sunday and decided to oppose the project. “We have decided to form a committee that will decide the further course of action against the project,” a farmer said.

The NMSCDCL has proposed the Greenfield township project over 750 acre in Makhmalabad area of the city, while the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) is the planning authority of the project.

The NMSCDCL has offered the land in 45:55 ratio where farmers will get 55% of the land they give for integrated development of the area. The land given by the farmers will be equipped with modern amenities, green belt, water supply, sewage supply lines, wide roads, parking spaces and host of other facilities.

In September last year, the General Body of the NMC had given approval to the proposal of the civic administration to develop TP scheme-based township project known as Greenfield project.

Thereafter, NMSCDCL had declared its intention of developing the new township project based on TP scheme on 750 acres in Makhmalabad areas of the city.

Last week, the smart city officials along with municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game gave a presentation to farmers about the proposed township.

“The 400 farmers, who are opposing the project, own around 50 hectare of the total 750 hectare proposed for the township project. The remaining farmers have given their consent to give their land,” an NMC official said.

JNUSU chief Aishe Ghosh after her meeting with officers from Crime Branch

NEW DELHI: Two teams from Crime Branch on Monday went to Jawaharlal Nehru University to question four students allegedly involved in the violence on January 5. The students, who were identified from CCTV footage, included JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh , Pankaj Mishra, Prashant Kumar and Vhaskar Vijay Mech .

The special investigation team reached the JNU campus around 11am and first called Mishra and Mech. Ghosh was quizzed at the end. Police used systematic ways to question the students. They asked about the sequence of events and the identity of the masked attackers seen by them. Ghosh was also questioned regarding the events preceding the January 5 violence.

“I told the SIT that will meet them at the JNUSU office. They asked me to tell them about my experience on January 5 and what evidences I had. I told them that I was ready to share my experience. The team told me that other high-ranking police officers will speak to me in the coming days,” Ghosh said.

Sources said Ghosh was shown CCTV footage recovered from Periyar hostel and asked to identify the people accompanying her. Police said she might again be called after her claims are verified. She was also questioned about the violence at Sabarmati hostel and asked to narrate the sequence of events.

Ghosh was among seven of the nine suspects from Left-backed students’ organisations. They have been opposing the hike in hostel fees and had called for a boycott of the semester registration process.

Following the questioning, the students said the officers were “professional and cordial” and that it was an informal meeting. “I was worried since morning as I was going to be quizzed by Crime Branch. But it was a good meeting and they were cordial. I’ve been asked to submit my statement soon,” said PhD student Prashant Kumar.

Mech, a School of Arts and Aesthetics student, who met the SIT in the administrative building, said, “I have to submit my statement on the questions posed by them. I talk about it after that.” Their statements would be corroborated after which police will come to a conclusion.

JNUSU said that police also met some students who had got their medico-legal cases done after the January 5 violence. They will meet more students in the coming days.

Notices were also sent to the residences of three students who were identified after a sting operation by a TV news channel. Their mobile phones were found switched off ever since the programme was telecast. The students — Akshat Awasthi, Komal Sharma and Rohit Shah — were not found at the addresses submitted by them in their universities.

358,['14/01/2020'],Fair value of land may rise 20% as Goa eyes revenue growth,"The new price for sale and registration of properties will come into force soon

PANAJI: The state government is likely to revise the fair value of land by 20% under the Goa Stamp (Determination of True Market Value of Property) Rules, 2003. The new price for sale and registration of properties will come into force soon. A file in this regard has been referred by the revenue department to revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate.With the enforcement of new rules, property buyers will have to shell out more for execution of sale agreements and deeds thereby generating more revenue for the state.A senior government officer said that once the file is approved by the minister, it will be referred to the cabinet before a notification is issued.Another senior government officer said that as per the rules, it was mandatory for the government to revise the fair value every year. However, last revision in the prices was done in 2013.The officer also said that as of now there is no proposal to fix minimum price for the execution of sale deeds for flats. “We have not touched stamp duty for executing agreements or deeds of sale,” he said.The new rates will not apply to purchases made by mundkars and tenants from landlords under the Goa, Daman and Diu Mundkars (Protection from Eviction) Act, 1975 and the Goa, Daman and Diu Agricultural Tenancy Act, 1964.In land acquisition matters, the rates fixed as fair values are the broad guiding factors in determining the compensation to be paid by the acquisition officer.In 2013, taluka-wise minimum rates were fixed on base values and applicable to settlement zone up to an area of 1,000 sq mt. Depending on the zone and area involved, the base values were changed from a minimum of Rs 20 to over Rs 7,000 per sq mt. These rates are likely to remain the same, said a government officer.As per the notification of 2013, the applicable for Taleigao was increased from Rs 2,000 to Rs 4,000, while in Bambolim and Bainguinim, it was fixed at Rs 3,000 per sq mt. The same rate was made applicable to land tracts in Chimbel, St Cruz and Cujira. With the new rates, the byuers will have to pay an additional amount of Rs 700-800 per sq mt in these areas.Interestingly, the rate fixed for ward number 17 and 18 in Panaji was Rs 3,000 per sq mt, while it was Rs 5,000 in most of the other wards. Here the prices will go up by Rs 600-Rs 1,000 per sq mt, respectively.For Bardez, the rate has been fixed at Rs 3,000 in areas such as Sangolda, Guirim, Moira, Assagao and Salvador do Mundo, while it was Rs 5,000 in Candolim, Calangute and Nerul. In Aldona and Socorro it was Rs 4,000. The buyers will have to bear additional Rs 600-Rs 1,000 per sq mt in these areas.There is variation in land rates for Salcete taluka. The rate has been fixed at Rs 5,617 per sq mt in Navelim area, while it is Rs 3,427 per sq mt in Nuvem. A 20% hike will force buyers to bear additional burden of Rs 800-Rs 1,000 per sq mt.Sernabatim was the most expensive locale with land value being fixed at Rs 7,750 per sq mt. The new value for land would increase by Rs 1,500 per sq mt. Likewise, in Varca, Benaulim and Colva, the new rate would be in the range of Rs 700 to Rs 1,600 per sq mt.In Ponda, it varied between Rs 500 per sq mt to Rs 1,500 per sq mt. Here the higher rates will be in the range of Rs 100 to Rs 300 per sq mt.In Mormugao taluka too, there is no consistency in land value rates. In the coastal areas of Arossim, Cansaulim, Velsao, Pale and Chicolna, the rate was fixed at Rs 500 per sq mt, while in Quelosim was at Rs 350 per sq mt. The additional burden would be be in the range of Rs 70-Rs 100.In ‘developing’ areas of Cortalim and Sancoale, the rate was fixed at Rs 1,200 per sq mt, and Dabolim and Chicalim it was Rs 1,500 per sq mt. A change in the value would mean a rise of Rs 300 to the existing prices.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73237313,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-718983,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fair-value-of-land-may-rise-20as-state-eyes-revenue-growth/articleshow/73236056.cms

Meerut: After a brief respite, city residents woke up to foggy and cold-wave like conditions as the temperature dipped to 7.2 degree Celsius on Monday. The maximum temperature settled at 16.2 degrees. There seems to be no respite for the days to come as the weatherman has forecast thunderstorm and hail from Tuesday onwards.

Neighbouring Saharanpur witnessed snow-like hailstorm after which residents here came together to get pictures clicked. While the maximum temperature was six notches below normal temperature, the minimum temperature did not deviate from the normal temperature. The city also recorded 0.2mm rainfall on Monday.

“The maximum and minimum humidity levels recorded here on Monday were 97% and 6% respectively. Meanwhile, rainfall and thunderstorm are predicted in the city in the days to come, due to high humidity levels and western disturbances,” said Brij Mohan, meteorological department in-charge of Meerut.

Meanwhile, doctors have advised elderlies and children to stay indoors and avoid going outside as much as possible. “At a time when the temperatures are dipping and rainfall is predicted, elderlies and kids should try to remain indoors at most times to ensure that they do not fall ill. In fact, in case of fever or any throat infection, people should see a doctor and not delay the treatment,” said Dr Raj Kumar, Meerut chief medical officer.

Panaji: Protocol minister Mauvin Godinho on Monday said that he will seek a detailed report from the protocol secretary about how Lucknow resident Sunil Kumar Singh, claiming to be UP ’s cooperative minister, managed to take the state for a ride for almost 12 days. Further, he said he will ask the secretary for a list of measures that need to be taken to avoid such incidents.

“I will ask the protocol secretary to report to me how the incident happened, who was negligent and what steps should be taken to see that such an incident is not repeated,” he said

The minister told TOI that the procedure for giving a person the status of state guest includes the protocol department receiving a request from the said state for the same.

A police team which has gone to Lucknow, UP, also verified that the letter, which was sent to the Goa protocol department, was not sent by the UP government.

Meanwhile, Singh’s police custody, ends on Tuesday.

It all started with an e-mail that the protocol department received, requesting for a reservation for Singh in the state-run Circuit House. Without verifying the e-mail, the department considered him as a state guest and reserved a room for three days.

JAIPUR: The menace of pink locusts, the most destructive of the species, is continuing in the desert districts of Rajasthan. On Sunday evening, a fresh swarm of pink locusts entered Anoopgarh tehsil in Sriganganagar and some areas of Barmer from the Bhawalpur region of Pakistan with the gusty winds, forcing farmers to guard their Rabi crop using traditional methods like beating trumpets and utensils on Monday afternoon.The Locust Warning Organization (LWO), an agency under the ministry of agriculture, has issued warning to local administration to use anti-locust pesticides in their respective areas.“Since morning, the operation has been going at several places in Anoopgarh and the area will be declared ‘cleaned’ by Tuesday afternoon,” said K L Gurjar, director of LWO, over the phone from Anoopgarh.Gurjar is camping in the affected area since yesterday and coordinating the operation which includes spraying chemicals in both cropped and crop areas. “The operation in Sriganganagar has been comparatively easier as farmers are more resourceful.

364,['14/01/2020'],Opposition resolution on CAA must have made Pak happy: Ravi Shankar Prasad,"This story is from January 14, 2020

NEW DELHI: Slamming resolution of opposition parties against the Citizenship Amendment Act, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday said Pakistan must be happy over the move and asserted that the new law exposes Islamabad's “barbaric treatment” of minorities.

“Opposition unity stands exposed as major parties like SP, BSP, TMC and AAP kept away (from a meeting convened by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi ). The resolution is neither in national interest nor in the interest of security. It is also not in the interest of those minorities who fled neighbouring countries to escape persecution,” Prasad told reporters.

Congress and 19 other opposition parties passed a resolution on Monday, demanding that the amended citizenship law be withdrawn and process of National Population Register (NPR) immediately stopped, asserting that it was all part of an “unconstitutional package” that targeted poor people, SC/STs and minorities.

Prasad said Congress is ready to stoop to any level against Prime Minister Narendra Modi . “Today Congress stands with the gang of tukde-tukde and urban Maoists. I am making an unambiguous allegation that Congress is inciting violence in the country,” he said.

The minister said Congress should explain what is the reality about the state of the minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh. “Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi should explain whether most of the people facing persecution on religious lines in Pakistan and Bangladesh were poor and Dalit or not?” he asked.

Prasad said opposition is making baseless allegations that the bill was passed in a hurry as he added, “The bill was debated in both Houses for two days after which it was passed through voting. Now it is being alleged that the bill was passed in a huff.”

Taking a dig at the absence of several key opposition parties from Monday’s meeting, he said, “The so-called resolution was passed after meeting of 19 parties. However, BSP, SP, AAP and TMC were not present in the meeting and their absence exposes the opposition unity.”

BJP leader GVL Narasimha Rao took a dig at P Chidambaram for opposing CAA, saying that the former finance minister had brought his level of intellect at par with that of Rahul Gandhi .

Chidambaram asked the Prime Minister to have a televised Q and A session over the CAA. The former Union minister alleged that Modi is reluctant to take questions over the Act, which has triggered widespread protests across the country.

""Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Chidambaram are telling lies about CAA and misleading people and country,"" he added. ""When Pakistan is being exposed in the world for persecuting minorities, those opposing CAA are furthering Pakistan's point of view,"" Rao said.

NEW DELHI: Lofty promises no longer stir up emotions in most residents of unauthorised colonies in the city, cannon fodder as they have been for different political parties for decades. Unsurprisingly, in the run-up to the latest assembly , too, the netas are in a mad scramble to take credit for giving that final push for a legal stamp to these areas.And while the grant of conveyance deeds of houses to a handful of residents by the Centre has triggered a war of words between AAP , BJP and Congress , the residents themselves are wary of celebrating early, as TOI found on visiting some of these colonies in south, east and north Delhi.In east Delhi’s Kondli, congested lanes, broken roads and overflowing drains serve a reminder, if ever one was needed, that large swathes of Delhi are yet to be put on the development map. For some residents, a renewed hope to finally be able to call the homes they have been living in as rightfully their own is enticing, but the overwhelming sentiment is in favour of getting at least the basic infrastructure .RD Sharma, a resident, can’t hide his disappointment as he recalls a visit to a helpdesk set up by DDA to facilitate the conferment of ownership rights. “They are just sharing information about the documents required for getting the conveyance deed. Also, ownership rights don’t mean that the area has been regularised. Unless that is done, we can forget about any planned development,” he says. While many residents are not clear about the process, others are not sure exactly how much ownership rights will benefit them.Sharma’s neighbour points to the badly damaged stretch to ask if they don’t even deserve proper roads. Encroachments are rampant and, as Sharma says, the “illegal” tag associated with the area has kept any kind of planned activity at bay. However, he commends the work done by AAP government in the recent times. “Internal roads are better and even sewer lines have been laid,” he says.In nearby Gharoli Dairy Farm, poor sanitation raises a stink. Shashi Kala, a longtime resident, says even a hint of rain causes drains to overflow. “It’s difficult to believe that we live in the national capital,” Kala asserts. Go a little further, however, and residents of Gharoli in Mandawali Fazalpur appear satisfied with the efforts put in by AAP government. Hazi Irshad, for one, says he is least bothered about the ownership rights. “Regularisation has nothing to do with the pace of development. Our roads are in a better shape and water and power supply is regular now,” he says.Anand Sharma (name changed), a resident of Mayur Vihar Phase I, on the other hand, argues that allowing illegal construction and, then, demanding their regularisation for vote politics is turning city into urban sprawl. “I welcome DDA’s move to set a cutoff date for approving documents for ownership rights.”At the other end of the city, in south Delhi areas like Sangam Vihar, Ambedkar Nagar, Deoli and Tughlaqabad, which bet heavily on AAP in the 2015 assembly election, the mood is more upbeat. Residents acknowledge that they have seen development on a par with other areas: roads are smoother, water supply has improved and CCTV cameras are being installed.For many residents approached by TOI, the announcement of “regularisation” by the Centre doesn’t hold much water. Kiran Gupta, a resident of Madangir, says she isn’t even sure if the promises will materialise into anything. “I bought forms under the Rajiv Gandhi Awas Yojna a decade ago. Did anyone keep their promise? At least now I am saving thousands of rupees every month in power and water bills,” she said. In the last five years, she claims, concrete roads have been built and the drainage system improved.Not far away, in Shiv Shankar Market of Ambedkar Nagar, we catch up with Kusum Devi who is busy with her weekly shopping. “This road has been rebuilt twice in the last five years. My daughter studies in Class XII in a government school and the infrastructure there has also improved by leaps and bounds,” she claims.Ram Singh, a resident of Duggal Colony close by, says most families continue to buy bottled water but this is mostly because of a general fear of contamination. “During monsoon, the drains start overflowing. While the situation has improved, there are still pain points,” Singh explains.Rajdeep Paswan, a fruit vendor and resident of Sangam Vihar, is clear about where his preferences lie. “We like (Narendra) Modi at the Centre and (Arvind) Kejriwal in Delhi. Our water woes have been virtually resolved,” Paswan said. “You may feel that things are bad right now, but you should have come here five years ago,” he signs off emphatically.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73237066,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-297467,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/registration-cant-paper-over-cracks-road-to-assembly-may-pass-via-infra/articleshow/73236073.cms

Meerut: A 32-year-old auto rickshaw stand owner set himself ablaze after allegedly being misbehaved by a few policemen, who he said were extorting money from a driver.

Ashwini Lodhi, 28, was rushed to a Delhi hospital with 50% burn injuries on Sunday evening. Soon after the incident, a sub inspector was suspended for dereliction of duty and a probe was instituted under a DSP-rank officer.

“With 50% burn injuries, Lodhi has been referred to higher centre in Delhi. His condition is critical,” SSP Meerut Ajay Sahni said.

On their part, local police said that Lodhi was running an illegal auto stand in the area. “On Sunday afternoon, local policemen were trying to manage traffic near Maliyana flyover in TP Nagar police station. When they slapped a fine on an auto rickshaw driver, a commotion broke out and several drivers, including Lodhi, gathered and protested,” a police officer said.

But the drivers and Lodhi said that they were protesting against local police’s extortion.

Later, peeved over alleged misbehavior by the policemen, Lodhi poured some flammable substance on his body and lit it near Maliyana flyover.

Lodhi was rushed to a city hospital from where he was referred to Delhi. A sub inspector posted at the local police outpost under TP Nagar police station was suspended for dereliction of duty.

Investigation under DSP Chakrapani Triapthi was also set up and the statement of Lodhi was recorded.

According to sources, in his statement, Lodhi claimed that he took the extreme step due to harassment of the auto drivers in the name of challans.

“We have received a complaint from the deceased’s brother. FIR is yet to be filed. Investigation is already on under a DSP-level officer,” Meerut SP (City) Akhilesh Narayan Singh said.

369,['14/01/2020'],HC relief for man in drugs case,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has granted a six-month anticipatory bail to a man who claimed to have reasonable apprehension of being arrested by Jalgaon police in connection with the seizure of over 31 kg of marijuana around three months ago.

Jillapeth police station in neighbouring Jalgaon district arrested Vicky Sonawane and Tanveer Tadvi from a bus stand and bags containing the marijuana were seized from them. During interrogation the accused claimed that got marijuana from a person called Fakira. Police then launched a hunt for a man identified as Fakira Masum Tadvi.

Worried over being arrested, Tadvi approached lower court which rejected his bail plea, following which he reached out to the HC seeking anticipatory bail citing that he has reasonable apprehension of being arrested mere on basis of his first name and he was not the same person the police are looking for.

Representing Fakira, lawyer Joydeep Chatterji, contested that the investigation officer did not identify if the person named by the arrested accused and also if the applicant in the case is the same person.

Jalgaon police, meanwhile, contested that the applicant in the case remained in touch with the arrested accused forcing them to believe that he is the same Fakira they have been looking for in the registered case.

HC justice RG Avachat, while granting bail, said: “The arrested accused did not give full name of any person from whom they had brought marijuana. The first name of the applicant only tallies with the name disclosed by the accused. Only this much material is grossly inadequate to curtail liberty of the applicant by taking him in custody.”

The court added that the investigation officer has made no investigation to find whether the applicant in fact did sell narcotics like marijuana.

“With a view to give the investigating officer full liberty to make investigation to find as to whether it is the applicant from whom the accused had brought marijuana, I am inclined to grant the applicant anticipatory bail for a duration of six months,” the court ruled.

Locust Warning Organization is carrying out anti-locust operations in the state

JAIPUR: Refuting the Union ministers’ allegations of casual approach in handling the locust attack, Rajasthan government has asked the agriculture ministry to provide logistic support to its agency Locust Warning Organization (LWO) for effectively carrying out anti-locust operations in the state.

The LWO is handling operations from Sriganganagar to Gujarat border with just 35 vehicles while the state has claimed to have provided 450 tractors for spraying chemicals in the affected areas. Even the LWO is not getting real-time assistance on the movement of locusts and forecast from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), confessed LWO officials.

The incessant attacks by locusts in Rajasthan since May 23, 2019 have become a matter of tension between the Centre and the state.

Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and Union minister of state for agriculture Kailesh Chaudhary have blamed CM Ashok Gehlot for delay in providing assistance including financial help to farmers and logistical support on time.

“The state already has surplus funds under the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) but they are yet to grant any help to farmers. Second, I have learnt that cooperation with the central machinery in reaching out to the affected areas is minimal. Gujarat government has prevented the tragedy on time as they coordinated with the central government in the better manner,” said Chaudhary over the phone.

Claiming that the state has provided full assistance to the central government, Lalchand Kataria, agriculture minister of the state, said even the central government officials on the ground are admitting the humongous support received from the state.

“I am a farmer and don’t want to engage in politics over locust attacks in the state. The state has done it best as per our understanding and ability to deal with the problem,” he said.

Defending the delay in carrying out assessment of crop damage, Kataria said everything was done on time. “The assessment of crop damage has already been completed of the vast affected areas and information is being uploaded on the portals. The amount will be disbursed in the coming days,” said Kataria.

He also cleared that the state provided 450 tankers, mostly hired on rent to expedite work. “Those blaming must know that the state is providing chemicals for free to the farmers. The scale of locust attack is very huge and the Centre should appreciate efforts made by the state as we appreciate their efforts,” said Kataria.

The minister added that the state had deputed agriculture department officials to complete the Girdawari report on loss of crops latest by Wednesday.

JAIPUR: Flying kites and lanterns is fun and part of the tradition of celebrating Makar Sankranti. But it has now become a threat to air traffic. On Monday, the Airports Authority of India (AAI), Jaipur, issued an advisory urging people not to fly kites or lamps within the 5km periphery of the airport.In the advisory, the airport authority has stated that kites and ‘manjhas’ can be dangerous for flight operations. “The air traffic control is constantly asking pilots landing here to be careful during the festival when kites dot the sky. Also, the trend of releasing gas lamps can prove to be dangerous,” said a senior official of the air traffic control.Speaking to TOI, Jaideep Balhara, director, AAI, said, “In 2018, we had a case in which the engine of an aircraft developed a snag after getting caught in ‘manjha’ strings while landing in Jaipur. The lanterns too create problems in the evening.”The air traffic control is also alerting pilots asking them to “be careful of lanterns as the festival is on”.“We have issued an appeal in which we have urged people not to fly kites and release lamps within the 5km periphery of the airport,” said a senior official.“We have issued an appeal in which we have urged people not to fly kites and release lamps within the 5km periphery of the airport,” said a senior official.Some airports, including Ahmedabad and Delhi, have banned lantern kites within 10km of the airport.

NEW DELHI: An email dated December 19, 2019 from V Ramgopal Rao , director, Indian Institute of Technology , Delhi, to his colleagues went in circulation on Monday, after it was linked to the current state of Jawaharlal Nehru University .

While Rao could not be contacted for his reaction, senior faculty members at the IIT said that the mail was written 18 days before the JNU violence and was not connected to the unrest in the neighbouring campus.

Rao, in his email to his colleagues in different departments, had encouraged them to recruit the faculty members leaving JNU, especially if they held distinguished track record.

Rao wrote: “I am receiving many feelers from senior Jawaharlal Nehru University faculty showing a willingness to move to IIT Delhi, considering the deteriorating situation in JNU. I am told that some of them are also applying to other institutions given the impression that IIT Delhi doesn’t encourage lateral movement into higher positions. It will be a pity if we lose out on such good people because of any of these reasons/perception. I leave it to your judgment how you wish to deal with this. Institute will be very open to recruitment of senior faculty who have a distinguished track record.”

Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a dean who is also responsible for the recruitment process, said that as a general rule IITs does not recruit people from outside at senior levels.

“We usually recruit people from outside at the assistant professor level. We do not recruit too many people at the associate and professor levels from other institutions. That iso the norm here unlike other places. So there was a general message sent that there are people in Council of Scientific and Industrial Research labs and in other institutes, including JNU, who would like to move to IIT because of our facilities and better equipment, which have been bolstered by the Institute of Eminence tag. In that context, he asked us to consider,” the dean added. “This has nothing to do with JNU. It was written way before that.”

Visakhapatnam: Left parties requested district officials on Monday to extend the deadline for filing objections against the draft on ward delimitation prepared by the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) to January 27 instead of January 17.

At a meeting with district collector V Vinay Chand and GVMC officials, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader RKSV Kumar said the state government had recently increased the number of wards in the city to 98. “Consequently, the GVMC completed the delimitation process and published a draft. The ward reorganisation process was done in an unscientific manner. There was no mention of names of various major colonies and areas in the draft. The number of wards was determined based on the 2011 Census. But the city witnessed a growth in population in the last nine years. Several city dwellers will leave for their home towns for Sankranti. We demand the officials extend the deadline to January 27,” said Kumar.

Communist Party of India functionaries also submitted a representation to GVMC additional commissioner G Somannarayana, requesting the public be given more time to submit their objections on the new boundaries of 98 wards. CPI leaders K Satyanjaneya, G Rambabu and others were present.

AMARAVATI: In a surprising move, the government has decided not to hold elections to village panchayats in the capital city area. The decision to put the elections on hold was taken after finalization of reservations. Sources said panchayat raj principal secretary Gopalakrishna Dwivedi advised the state election commission (SEC) not to go ahead with the issuance of election notification.

Stating that the government is planning to create a new municipal corporation for Amaravati, the principal secretary urged the SEC to put the elections on hold. The government might make an announcement on upgrading the capital city area into a municipal corporation in the next assembly session. As per the original schedule, the SEC was scheduled to issue notification for elections to mandal parishad territorial constituencies (MPTCs) and ZPTCs on Jan 17.

The move is being seen as a measure to calm local villagers who have been protesting for the last 27 days against the proposal to shift the capital city from Amaravati. Upgrading it into a urban civic body is likely to help the area witness rapid development as the government can tap funds from the urban development ministry. The state is planning to pool funds for taking up underground drainage, roads, sewage treatment system and other developmental works in the capital city area by making it a municipal corporation.

The move will also give an upper hand to the ruling YSRC in pushing opposition TDP into a corner for not making the capital city area into an urban civic body in the last five years while making tall claims to build a world-class city.

The SEC has also been asked to delay the release of election notification for a few other village panchayats which are proposed to be merged with the nearest municipal towns. While Dachepalle, Gurazala and Nizampatnam would be upgraded to nagar panchayats, Bethapudi, Navulur, China Kakani, Atmakur and Yerrabalem villages would be merged with Mangalagiri municipality. Praturu, Vaddeswaram, Penumaka, Ippatam, Mellempudi, Chirravuru, Gundimeda and Undavalli would be merged with Tadepalle municipality.

Meanwhile, the capital city area continues to reverberate with protests as farmers staged dharnas in almost all the villages on Monday. Police had set up dharna camps in many areas, including vacant sites owned by farmers. Women from capital area villages like Venkatapalem and Krishnayapalem visited the place where Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone for Amaravati and performed pujas seeking divine intervention to stop the shifting of the capital.

Women from Ananthavaram village performed prayers at Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple. They said the SVBC chairman lost his job after making unsavoury comments against the area’s farmers and women.

Siva Swamy, the seer of Siva peetham in Tallayapalem village near Thullur, visited the dharna camp in Thullur and said he would perform a special yagam for the welfare of farmers, for which he would invite seers from about 153 peethams across the country. “The capital city should stay in Amaravati as it’s a divine place. The yagam would be held at the place where the PM had laid the foundation stone,” he said.

TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh also visited Bapatla and met farmers who were arrested during the ongoing agitation for Amaravati. He also participated in a round-table meeting organized by the Amaravati JAC and later went around the town to collect donations for the ‘Amaravati movement’.

Kozhikode: The state has decided to make its forest-fire prevention and management activities for the upcoming summer participatory. The forest department has issued directions that 50% of total funds allotted for forest-fire prevention be used for activities of the grassroots-level vana samrakshana samithies (VSSs), eco-development committees (EDCs) and forest development agencies ( FDAs ).

The move is expected to broad base the activities and add to the manpower on the ground. There are over 400 VSSs and 190 EDCs under the various territorial and wildlife divisions in the state.

Kerala witnessed 314 forest fires in 2018 affecting 1,114 hectares of land. Nearly 7,893km of fire lines were created during 2017-18 at a cost of Rs 23 crore.

“This year the head of the forest force has issued a directive to ensure that 50% of funds earmarked for fire protection be used for anti-fire activities of participatory forest institutions like VSS and EDC . The respective VSSs/EDCs will be provided Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 per hectare for undertaking fire-prevention measures in forest areas coming under them. VSS/ EDA members can become fire watchers and constitute fire gangs from among themselves,” said S R Radhakrishnan, assistant conservator of forests.

Forest department officials said this will ensure community participation, even among tribals, in forest-fire protection and also create awareness in communities about preventing fires caused by anthropogenic activities. He said the department has drawn up a fire plan and has classified the forests into three categories depending on the level of fire risk on the basis of incidents over the last five years.

A centralised control room is now functional and there were 45 fire incidents reported between December 24 and January 13 as per Fire Management Information System (FMIS), of which 43 were controlled burning carried out as part of fire-protection activities.

Meanwhile, citizen volunteer groups and environmentalists from across the state, who have come together under the Fire Free Forests collective, met authorities of the forest department and the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) on Monday with the plea for immediate steps to ensure the state free of fires in the upcoming summer season. The collective has called for constituting an independent fire force in the department, modernising fire prevention and control measures by deploying drones, and also increasing the allocation for fire-prevention measures.

Fire Free Forests representatives N Badusha, Anitha S , K M Sulaiman, Raheem Thalanad and Veena M were part of the delegation. They held discussions with P K Kesavan, principal chief conservator of forests and head of forest force, and principal secretary, revenue & disaster management Dr K Venu.

Badusha said methods adopted by the forest department to control forest fires are outdated and unscientific. He said involvement of district administrations, local self-government bodies and the SDMA should be ensured for fire-protection and control measures which are now mostly carried out by the department alone. “There is need for at least a fourfold increase in funds,” he added.

380,['14/01/2020'],Rajasthan: Mayawati skips Sonia Gandhi meeting over ‘betrayal’ of Ashok Gehlot,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Mayawati

JAIPUR: Accusing the Congress of betraying the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) despite giving outside support to the government in Rajasthan , party supremo Mayawati on Monday did not attend the Opposition meeting called by United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi .

Mayawati also appealed to the Centre to make amendments to the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

In a series of tweets in Hindi, Mayawati said, “Despite giving outside support to the Congress in Rajasthan, they made the BSP MLAs join their party for the second time, which is betrayal.”

“Thus, participating in the opposition meeting called by the Congress will be demoralising for the BSP. So BSP will not attend the meeting,” she said.

Her remarks came ahead of the opposition meeting convened by Sonia Gandhi on the issue of CAA, NRC and attacks on students in Jamia Millia Islamia University, Aligarh Muslim University and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). In a big jolt to BSP supremo Mayawati, all six members of the Rajasthan Assembly belonging to Bahujan Samaj Party, joined Congress in September last year.

Similar thing had happened during the previous Congress government. Gehlot poached all six BSP MLAS and inducted three ministers of state and three were made parliamentary secretaries equivalent to ministers of state.

Lamenting at the central government over the controversial CAA, Mayawati appealed to the government to take it back.

“The BSP is against the CAA and the NRC. BSP appeals to the government to roll back the divisive and unconstitutional Act. Even the politicisation of the students in JNU and other varsities is unfortunate,” the BSP chief added.

Aurangabad: A law student from Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Law College was detained by police for threatening to commit suicide.

The student was upset as his pleas for getting power and water supply to the student hostel was not being heard by the college administration. He had threatened self-immolation and accordingly put kerosene on himself on the college premises but was stopped by fellow students present at the spot.

Following this incident, a team from Cantonment police station reached the spot and took the student, Pratik Mhaske, in preventive detention.

Cantonment police station inspector Manoj Pagare said, “After learning about a student trying to immolate himself, we detained him before summoning his parents from Sindhkhedraja of Buldhana. He was counselled before we handed him over to parents.”

Talking to TOI, Pratik said, “The hostel building has exceeded its stipulated lifespan, but the college administration has moved 45 students in this hostel. We have been requesting basic facilities including power and water supply, but our request is being turned down citing that the structure is too old for granting fresh funds.”

Similar views were also expressed by other law students, who unanimously maintained that the issue was raised with the college administration and several letters have been shot to the state secretariat, but in vain.

Despite repeated attempts, calls made to college principal Niranand Behera went unanswered. Sources confirmed that as the hostel has exceeded its stipulated life span. “The issue is being raised by students for past several months, but it was only after one of the students residing in the hostel went to take an extreme step, the college administration took the issue seriously.”

Aurangabad: Aurangabad superintendent of police Mokshada Patil, taking note of visible fault lines in the newly-constructed residential quarters meant for policemen in Pachod, has pulled up the public works department and sent a letter, warning them of action.

The officer has also demanded safety audit of the two buildings that are yet to be occupied by the policemen and their families.

“During regular inspection of Pachod police station, the quarters were also visited only to witness visible fault lines. Seemingly dangerous, we have written to the PWD to give us safety audit report as they are the technical agency for the same,” Patil said.

Sources informed that SP expressed her serious displeasure over the quality of work as the structure has started to give-in.

During one of her recent visits, the officer noticed cracks on the walls and water stagnation due to uneven surface in the basement of the buildings.

Accordingly, Pachod police station’s assistant inspector Atul Yerme sent a letter stating that the two buildings comprising eight apartments each have developed cracks within and outside the structure, with some windows having only iron frames while the others have glass shields.

“Drainage lines have not been covered, while tiles fitted on the stairs are coming out. Paver blocks have not been installed in the open space and plaster on the exterior walls has started coming out. The septic tank is also not covered properly,” the letter read.

A total of Rs 2.13 crore has been spent for the construction of these two residential apartments. When contacted, Yerme said that following the letter from the SP, PWD has started carrying out the repair work.

“We cannot risk the lives of the families of our men. After the safety audit report is received, a call about it will be taken by the superintendent of police,” he said.

383,['14/01/2020'],‘File counter on plea seeking indirect polls for Kovilpatti union’,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Madurai: The state government has been directed to file a counter on a plea which sought to conduct indirect election for Kovilpatti panchayat union in Tuticorin district as the election was cancelled citing that the returning officer suffered from chest pain.

In his petition, M Ponnuthurai, a resident of Pandavarmangalam in Tuticorin district said he was the DMK candidate who contested in the election for ward 12 councillor of Kovilpatti panchayat union. Since he was declared as the winner, he became eligible to participate in the indirect election which is conducted to elect the posts of chairman and vice-chairman. While there are total of 19 wards in the panchayat union, there are 11 DMK councillors and eight AIADMK councillors.

When all the candidates assembled to take part in the indirect election on January 11, an order was passed by the assistant returning officer postponing the election citing that the returning officer was hospitalized as he fell ill.

Hence, the petitioner moved the Madras high court Madurai bench challenging the order postponing the election.

When the petition was heard on Monday, senior counsel Veera Kathiravan who appeared for the petitioner stated that after the indirect election was notified, a habeas corpus petition was filed before the court alleging that an independent candidate who was elected as councillor in Kovilpatti panchayat union was abducted. He noted that the court had imposed a cost of Rs 25,000 on the petitioner for filing a false case after the person who was said to have been abducted came to the court and informed that he left the town to avoid political pressure and was not abducted.

The counsel further submitted that since the DMK has majority of councillors in Kovilpatti panchayat union, the ruling AIADMK is taking steps to prevent the conduct of indirect election in a free and fair manner.

He stated that the police with the support of the ruling party are registering cases against the opposition party members by making false allegations. When all the elected representatives were present to participate in the indirect election for Kovilpatti, it was postponed.

The additional advocate general K Chellapandian submitted that the election was postponed as the returning officer was hospitalised after he fell ill during the election.

Taking note of the submissions, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran directed the state government to file the counter and adjourned the case to January 28 for further hearing.

PUNE: The number of deaths because of illegal trespassing on tracks in the Pune railway division dropped by nearly 19% in 2019 as compared to 2018, but senior Railway Protection Force officers stressed it was still a cause of concern.

The Railway Protection Force (RPF) has initiated a new campaign to bring the number of trespassing further down. “We have started route march at spots vulnerable to trespassing a couple of days ago. Under the initiative, our officers march along the tracks. Most recent route march was carried out in the Pimpri Chinchwad area and we believe it had an impact there. The RPF personnel engaged with people about the problems and tried to comprehend the reasons for trespassing,” Pune's divisional security commissioner Arun Tripathi told TOI.

A source in the railways said they were hopeful that their recent campaign would help in curbing the menace in the Pune rail division.

“The number of deaths and injuries caused because of illegal trespassing on tracks increased suddenly after June last year,” the source said.

Activists, however, remained wary of the initiative. “The officials should get serious and start imposing huge fines on the offenders or put them behind the bars,” said Harsha Shah, the president of the Railway Pravasi Group.

Representative image

AURANGABAD: The government wants to wean farmers away from water-intensive crops. After discouraging sugar cane cultivation, the government now wants farmers to look beyond cotton.

Addressing a farmers’ workshop on Monday, Union minister of state for water resources Rattan Lal Kataria said the farming community must opt for crop diversification instead of sticking to “water-guzzler” crops.

“Cotton, like sugar cane, is a water-guzzling crop. It takes about 22,500 litre of water to produce just 1 kg of cotton. The countries that are receiving the water-guzzling crops from India are, in fact, saving their own water resources,” he said.

The minister also cited case studies from Haryana , where farmers chose to grow maize and pearl millet — in place of traditional crops — as a part of crop diversification efforts. “The farmers who had adopted the change got good dividends. For instance, those who grew pearl millet made around Rs 2,000 per acre of land cultivated — this is more than what they would have earned growing wheat,” Kataria said.

Later, speaking with reporters, Kataria said the government does not want to enforce any decision on cropping pattern. “However, we will insist that the farming community considers alternatives to sugar cane and cotton. If more farmers respond to our appeal, the government is ready to increase the list of crops covered under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme,” he said.

This appeal to limit the cultivation of cash crops has not gone down well with the farmer activists. Farmer leader Jayaji Suryawanshi said the government must highly subsidise drip, sprinkler and micro-irrigation techniques before coming out with any cropping pattern suggestion. “It is true that judicious use of water is important. But it does not mean that farmers should sacrifice their assured income. The government must offer a 90% subsidy on water conservation techniques first before advocating crop diversification,” he said.

At the workshop, titled ‘Increasing Water-Use Efficiency In Agriculture ’, the minister also administered an oath to farmers about the judicious use of water.

G Ashok Kumar, the additional secretary of National Water Mission, R R Pawar and secretary of Command Area Development Authority, Maharashtra, also addressed the participants.

S Kaleeswari, a resident of A Mukkulam in Virudhunagar district, in her petition stated that she is a DMK member and was elected councillor of ward 3 of Narikudi panchayat union. She decided to contest for the post of chairman in the panchayat union as the chairman seat was reserved for women belonging to the scheduled caste community.

She stated that there are 14 wards in the panchayat union of which there are six DMK councillors, five AIADMK councillors, two independent councillors and one AMMK councillor. She stated that a woman Panchavarnam was fielded as the candidate for the post of chairman with the support of the AIADMK.

When the indirect election was conducted, it ended in a tie as she and Panchavarnam secured seven votes each. She stated that as per the provisions under Tamil Nadu Panchayat Election Rules, lot system should be followed when the election ends in a tie.

She claimed that the ruling party members ransacked the union office before a decision could be taken by the officials. She noted that the Aruppukottai deputy superintendent of police Venkatesan sustained cut injuries in his right hand. Due to the violence indirect election was not conducted.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench. When the petition was heard on Monday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran issued notice to the state government and adjourned the case to January 22 further hearing.

Scene from the integrated firepower and manoeuvre exercise, which was organized at KK Fire Range in Ahmednagar

AHMEDNAGAR: Major General S Jha, Commandant of Armoured Corps Centre and School, on Monday said mechanized forces can provide lethal power to counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations.

“The lethality of the enemy’s firepower has been continuously increasing in terrorist-infested areas. Mechanized forces can effectively tackle this threat, as they operate from armoured vehicles that provide the required cover to troops,” Jha told reporters on the sidelines of an integrated firepower and manoeuvre exercise at KK Firing Range here.

“Moreover,” Jha added, “They are able to penetrate speedily, employ ‘shock and awe’ tactics and finish the operation in a clinical manner, just like the infantry and the artillery.”

“One needs to understand certain aspects about tanks which are mobile, have a lot of firepower and provide protection too. They can move speedily and cross any obstacle easily. Thanks can fire three types of ammunition and even protect the fight troops from enemy fire,” Jha said.

Monday’s exercise was aimed at helping officer-students and those from the Defence Services Staff College and Technical Staff Officers course acquaint themselves with the operational capabilities of the mechanized forces. The army’s main battle tank Arjun, the Soviet-make front-line tanks T-90 and T-72, the infantry fighting vehicle BMP-II, carrier motor-tracked platforms and attack helicopters were used in the display.

Jha said mechanized forces will “never die” and that they have played vital role in wars and operations since World War II.

“Mechanized forces are the difference between victory and defeat for the Armed Forces. Any country’s win or loss will be dictated by the quality of its mechanized forces,” he said.

“Mechanized forces have proved their worth in operation in areas like Sopore in Jammu and Kashmir recently. On global scale, the tanks have been used effectively in fighting terror outfits in the Middle East,” he added.

Visakhapatnam: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is planning to popularise its online waste management system. Although efforts are being made to encourage segregation of waste and door-to-door collection of waste, the online system will make efforts more organised, according to GVMC officials.

A Quick Response ( QR ) code generation system will be provided on gates of all apartments in six wards. Once the garbage is collected from an apartment, one of the staff from the sanitation wing will scan the code and upload it on the application or website. This will help keep the civic body informed about the garbage collection on a daily basis from the particular apartment.

Speaking to TOI, GVMC commissioner G Srijana, said, “Enabling QR codes in every apartment is an assured way of garbage collection. This is to encourage door-to-door collection of garbage. The online system will enable us to keep a tab on the staff. If the garbage is not collected, people can upload the pictures on the GVMC mobile application and we will ensure that action is taken.”

She also added, “We have received 25% of the required equipments for online waste management system. On a pilot basis, it will be installed in one ward of every zone. In a few days, we would be receiving the rest of the equipment, the installation of which will be done immediately in most of the apartments in the wards of the city.”

Under the QR coding system for dustbins in tourist places like RK beach, the municipal bins have already been equipped with QR code. If the need arises and the municipality is required to be informed about emptying the dustbins, citizens can scan the QR code through the GVMC mobile application to raise an alert. Sanitary staff of the respective zone will be directed to take necessary action.

Thiruvananthapuram: Environmentalist Vandana Shiva said that patent on crops is a new form of colonization and the genetically modified organisms on food will have huge consequences. She was in the city to announce the International Biodiversity Congress ( IBC ) to be held in November.

IBC will be organized by the Centre for Innovation in Science and Social Action in association with Navdanya, an organization engaged in conservation of agriculture biodiversity, at University of Kerala, Kariavattom Campus, from November 25 to 27. The theme of the biannual event is ‘Biodiversity Targets 2020 and Beyond: Status and Aspirations’.

Speaking about the status of agriculture biodiversity, Vandana, founder of Navdanya, said that fake food flooding the market and digital piracy of crops are two threats the country faces. “These fake foods have triggered serious health concerns. There are also widespread attempts to develop new seed varieties through generic mapping. This poses serious threat to the country’s biodiversity. Patents are new forms of colonization, like second coming of Columbus,” she said.

Mentioning the demolition of buildings, which were constructed violating Coastal Regulation Zone norms, in Kochi, Vandana said that there is disconnect in the way we approach biodiversity. “We have to regain our knowledge of biodiversity to create biodiversity economies that allow us to conserve biodiversity and bring prosperity for farmer, so that they will not have to commit suicide and every second child of India will not have to be malnourished,” added Vandana.

NEW DELHI: If you are obese, diabetic or drink regularly, it is advisable to get the liver examined. As a large number of persons suffering from lifestyle problems may have an unhealthy liver , even when there are no overt symptoms.Between 2018 and 2019, the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), a state-run hospital, organised 200 mobile health camps in the catchment areas of mohalla clinics and polyclinics where middle aged men and women – average age of around 46 years – were screened for liver fibrosis . It denotes build-up of scar tissue in the liver due to repetitive or long-lasting injury or inflammation which can damage the organ.It was found that 35.5% people — one out of every three persons examined — had liver fibrosis. Nearly 14% had an advanced stage of liver fibrosis, which — if not treated — can result in irreversible liver damage, and 3% had probable cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease. “All those who were detected to have liver fibrosis were referred to the medical officer at the nearest mohalla clinic and polyclinics for further treatment and referral,” Dr Archana Rastogi, assistant professor of epidemiology at ILBS, said.The ILBS screening programme involved 7,624 persons. Of this, 804 reported consuming alcohol. The incidence of liver fibrosis was significantly higher in the first group, data revealed.According to Dr S K Sarin, director of ILBS, the study highlights an urgent need for awareness campaigns about chronic liver diseases that increase the danger if having fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver.“Strategies for early detection of liver diseases especially among the high risk groups like alcohol users, those with diabetes and other metabolic diseases is the need of the hour,” Dr Sarin said.The ILBS director added that chronic liver disease is a serious public health problem which, if left untreated, can turn fatal. “When nearly 80% to 90% of the liver is replaced by scar tissue, the process becomes irreversible and is technically called cirrhosis of the liver. Some of the patients with cirrhosis may further progress to develop liver cancer,” the doctor said.Chronic liver disease occurs due to several causes like viral infections (hepatitis B and C), alcohol use and diabetes among others. “If detected early, liver fibrosis can be reversed by restricting or removing the causative factors, for example limiting alcohol consumption and reducing weight,” Dr Sarin said.Doctors said till about two to three decades ago, hepatitis was blamed for most liver diseases. The incidence of liver diseases due to hepatitis has not decreased but there has been an increase in the disease due to obesity and alcohol, they add.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73237026,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-293529,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/study-finds-1-in-every-3-persons-in-capital-has-an-unhealthy-liver/articleshow/73236086.cms

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday challenged PM Narendra Modi to visit any Indian university without his security cover and infrastructure and tell students why the economy had “become a basket case”, and what he was doing with the country.

Accusing the Modi government of being an “absolute blanket disastrous failure” on the economic front and on the employment front, Rahul said, “Narendra Modi should stand up and have the courage to speak to the youngsters of these universities on why the economy has become a disaster, why has it become a basket case and why unemployment in India is at its highest in 50 years.”

Speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of 20 opposition party leaders, the Wayanad MP also claimed that the PM lacked the “guts to do this (meet students)”, which was why he had “crushed them using the police”.

“I challenge the Prime Minister to go to any of the universities, stand over there without his police, without his infrastructure and tell the people what is he going to do with this country,” Rahul said.

399,['14/01/2020'],Politics hampering river-linking project: Rattan Lal Kataria,"This story is from January 14, 2020

AURANGABAD: Union minister of state for water resources Rattan Lal Kataria said here on Monday that vote bank politics was hampering the progress of the Centre’s ambitious river-linking project.

Kataria said the proposed legislation aimed at creating a dispute redressal body.

“Even some of the states that have excess water in certain areas are reluctant to give water to the neighbouring states. Local leaders fear that they would lose their votes if the water is shared. Such vote-bank politics has been stalling the river-linking project,” he said.

The minister said the law dealing with inter-state water dispute has been passed in the Lok Sabha and is awaiting the approval in Rajya Sabha. “The legislation will give an effective legal framework to address inter-state water disputes. We believe that solution to every problem can be reached with discussion. The states should come forward and the Centre is ready to act as a mediator,” Kataria said.

He added that of the 30 identified major rivers that can be linked, the detailed project report (DPR) of four natural waterways is ready.

On possible opposition to Maharashtra drawing benefits of the river-linking project, Kataria said certain political elements from states such as Telangana , Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat could create hurdles.

It may be recalled that then Union minister of state for water resources Nitin Gadkari, during the campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections last year, had said that DPR to get water from the basin of Damanganga river for Marathwada was ready. The proposed diversion, which is part of the river-linking project of the Centre, had received a push from the state government in July last year when the state cabinet decided to complete the Nar-Par-Tapi and Damanganga-Pinjal river-linking projects. The Nar-Par-Tapi river-linking project, which was said to be a mix of the lift irrigation schemes, tunnels and canal systems is expected to fetch around 52 TMC water for Marathwada.

Officially termed as the Inter-Linking of River (ILR), the river-linking programme has been received the status of national importance to ensure greater equity in the distribution of water by enhancing the availability of water in drought-prone and rainfed areas. Under the National Perspective Plan (NPP) prepared by the water resources ministry, 14 links have been identified under the Himalayan Rivers Component and 16 links under Peninsular Rivers Component for inter-basin transfer of water-based on field surveys and investigation and detailed studies.

SECUNDERABAD: Ahead of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) elections, a ticket aspirant on Monday flagged 2,167 alleged duplicate voters from six wards and sought deletion of these voters from the electoral rolls.Using a mobile application developed by a private party that detects duplicate voters from respective wards, Shravan Kumar, a Bharatiya Janta Party hopeful from ward 4, found that there were over 2,167 duplicate voters. The app verified 1.21 lakh voters from the six wards. Of the total number of duplicate voters identified using the application, 1,123 were detected from ward 4 alone, highest among the six, followed by 342 in ward 5 and 320 in ward 8.For example, the application detected that voter number 500 and voter 511 in ward 3 had same e-voter name, relative name, address and age. Similarly, in ward 4, voter 417 and 483 had the same house number, name and age.In a representation to SCB chief executive officer SVR Chandra Sekhar, Shravan highlighted many examples of multiple entries of an individual of the same family with the same address having different serial numbers. In other cases, even if entries with same address, same relation were found, spelling of the voter’s name and age were changed in different serial numbers. There were multiple entries of a single voter with different serial numbers.“The authorities must delete duplicate/multiple voters from Secunderabad Cantonment electoral rolls (2019-20) pertaining to the respective wards,” Shravan added.The SCB officials said they would try to weed out duplicate voters before the elections. “Percentage of such voters is very less. However, we will verify the data on the ground before the elections and update the list accordingly,” an SCB official, on condition of anonymity, said.Meanwhile, the candidates in fray have already started door-to-door campaigning ahead of the SCB elections likely to be held by February, 2020.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73238633,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148641,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ticket-aspirant-flags-2167-duplicate-voters/articleshow/73235183.cms

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Three members of the IS-inspired terror module , who were caught by the Special Cell last week, had allegedly planned to kill senior police officers and Hindu leaders who were vocal against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.

Two of them were affiliated to Popular Front of India and Manitha Neethi Pasarai, its parent organisation. It has been revealed that its leader, Khaja Moideen (52), who was out on bail, had wanted to carry out targeted strikes at multiple locations, said a source. The men, along with associate Zafar Ali who has been arrested in Gujarat, had even procured four weapons and a cache of cartridges to carry out the attacks. Police are looking for three more associates.

The module had specifically zeroed in on western UP as it had seen violent clashes over CAA . Moideen had radicalised several youths in Bengaluru, 17 of whom were named in an FIR filed there last Saturday. The module is suspected to be linked to the murder of a police officer in Kerala on January 8.

Moideen told the cops that he had made a plan to revive the IS network in India. Guided by a foreign-based handler, several meetings were organised at different hideouts to make youths pledge allegiance to slain IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Moideen, along with Syed Ali Nawaz (32) and Abdul Samad (28), then went to Kathmandu and came to Delhi after setting up a base in Nepal.

Anchepalya residents demand Metro station

BENGALURU: Metro commuters may be feeling a sense of deja vu after the deadline for extending the northern corridor beyond Nagasandra station by 3km was pushed to January 2022.Construction work on the elevated Nagasandra-Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC) corridor began in 2017 and was slated to be completed in 27 months (by mid-2019). The deadline was first extended to 2020 and later to 2021. Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd ( BMRCL ) officials blamed land acquisition issues for the delay .Incidentally, the tip of the currently operational northern section between Peenya Industry and Nagasandra too had witnessed many delays for the same reason: acquisition of a piece of land at Jalahalli Cross.BMRCL records show less than half (44%) of the civil work has been completed so far on Nagasandra-BIEC section. The extension is expected to provide Metro connectivity to thousands of passengers on the city outskirts and ensure smoother access to places like Jindal Naturecure Institute and BIEC.The Rs 298-crore contract to build stations at Manjunathanagar, Chikkabidarkallu (Jindal) and BIEC (Madavara) on the extended stretch under Phase 2 was awarded in February 2017. BMRCL sources said there was a delay in getting the required land from agencies like Jindal, BIEC, NHAI and Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprise (NICE). It is yet to receive land from NICE.""This stretch was supposed to be completed before the Mysuru Road and Kanakapura Road extended sections, which will be operational this year. The contractor’s poor financial condition is also a cause of worry,"" said a BMRCL source.Sources said NICE has approached the high court against the compensation of its land evaluated by Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa recently asked BMRCL to deposit the amount in court and start work on the NICE land.Tumakuru Road is a major thoroughfare that connects Bengaluru with other parts of the state, besides Maharashtra. It is used by hundreds of intercity bus operators. Earlier, there was a proposal to stop buses on the outskirts.India’s Metro Man and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s principal adviserE Sreedharan had said a day’s delay in operationalising Metro would cost BMRCL about Rs 1.5 crore. Regular commuters to areas beyond Nagasandra say the project should be expedited. ""Those who come to BIEC from the city have to get down at Nagasandra and rely on illegal shared autos. I don’t know why this small section is still incomplete,"" said Ramesh Kumar, a commuter.Bengaluru: For two months now, residents of Anchepalya, beyond Nagasandra, on Tumakuru Road, have been protesting in a makeshift tent, demanding construction of a Metro station in their area. The protesters have threatened to halt ongoing work on the 3-km section of Nagasandra-BIEC section and also block Tumakuru Road if their demand is not met.Residents feel they have been betrayed. Mukesh D, a resident, said a Metro station had been earlier planned at Anchepalya. ""It would have benefited those living in and around Anchepalya and Totadaguddadahalli,"" he said.""The distance between Nagasandra and Madavara (BIEC) is 3.5km and the first two stations planned — Manjunathanagar and Chikkabidarakallu — are within one km. Normally, there should be a Metro station every 1km. BIEC station is more than 2km from Chikkabidarakallu,"" said Khadar Pasha, another resident. T Srinivas, who is leading the protest, said, ""We will soon approach the high court and also block the highway if they continue to ignore our demand.""Srikantapura panchayat president Venkatesh M said, ""Sufficient land is available at Anchepalya to set up a station. We want to know whether BMRCL’s priority is common people or private real estate firms. Most Anchepalya residents are daily-wage employees.""A senior BMRCL official said: ""The detailed project report never envisaged a station at Anchepalya. The station planned at the playground of Jindal school was shifted towards the east to save the playground and school buildings.""",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73237245,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-25857,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/3-km-metro-line-on-tumakuru-road-delayed-again-land-hurdle-to-blame/articleshow/73236023.cms

Visakhapatnam: In view of the damage done to ASI monuments – the hilltop Buddhist shrines of Bojjanakonda and Lingalakonda — during Kanuma Jatara in recent years, Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) representatives have requested the district administration and other authorities to provide police protection at archaeological sites against rampage and vandalism by drunken locals.

Intach convener Mayank Kumari Deo said, “Every year, a Jatara (village fest) is held wherein thousands of people descend on these two Buddhist sites on Kanuma, most of them in high spirits. They pull out the bricks and throw them into the caves as well as throw stones onto the stupas. The people also litter these sites with liquor bottles and vast amounts of trash. The stupas have been damaged in the past due to a superstitious ritual of the Vajrayana period that has no relevance any more.”

“These sites which have been documented in the world heritage encyclopedia are of vital importance to Visakhapatnam as heritage and tourist attractions. We, therefore, request the police to provide protection. In the past, district collectors have responded by sending a strong police force to protect the site and this year too we request that these sites be protected,” the convener added.

The twin sites of Bojjanakonda and Lingalakonda, near Anakapalle, date to the third century BC. All three forms of Buddhism—Mahayana, Hinayana and Vajrayana--were prominent at the site.

PUNE: With Makar Sankranti on Tuesday, shopkeepers claimed that they were flooded with requests for glass-coated nylon manja despite a nationwide ban on it.Kite-flying enthusiasts continue to be keen on glass-coated nylon manja, despite its ban. Shopkeepers selling in kites and manja said many of their customers simply don’t care about the ban.“People come to (our shop), asking for such manja, but we have stopped selling it for many years ago. We have displayed a notice outside our shop, stating that we don’t sell nylon manja, but that doesn’t stop people from asking,” Akbar Menon, who runs Royal Patang Depot in Raviwar Peth, said.Menon said like every year, this year too inspections were conducted by police and civic officials. “This year, forest department officials too were a part of random inspections,” he said.Animal rights activist and bird rescuer Anil Avchite said he comes across 15-20 cases of injured birds in the aftermath of Makar Sankranti each year.“People need to understand that manja kills birds. We appeal to people to use regular thread or normal manja. Kites trailing manja often get stuck on buildings or trees, putting birds at risk,” Avchite said.Avchite said there was a need for a stricter implementation of the ban. “Despite their denials, many shopkeepers sell nylon manja under the counter. Ask any children and they will point you to shops that sell them.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Vizag Film Society ( VFS ) has requested chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy to make the film on acid attack survivors—‘ Chhapaak ’—entertainment tax-free in Andhra Pradesh similar to a few other states in northern India.

States such as Rajasthan , Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh and the Union territory of Puducherry have exempted the film from entertainment tax .

Narava Prakasa Rao, secretary of the society, in a letter addressed to the chief minister, stated, “In view of the importance of the film ‘Chhapaak,’ VFS requests you to intervene and grant entertainment tax exemption so as to enable women to watch the film and get inspired, which is the need of the day. It is a sensitive film with delicate yet powerful handling of a heinous crime against women.”

The film is directed by Megha Gulzar in which Deepika Padukone plays the lead role. Based on a real-life incident, the film portrays how a woman tries to rebuild her life after a man throws acid on her.

Mangalagiri MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy being detainedduring the rally at Penumaka in Guntur district on Monday

Guntur: Demanding the trifurcation of the capital city, Mangalagiri MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy took out a rally in Guntur on Monday.

Scores of YSRC cadre joined the rally in support of decentralisation of development. Police however prevented the legislator and cadres from going ahead with the march keeping in view of the prohibitory orders. The police detained MLA and his followers before taking them to the local police station.

Speaking to reporters, Alla said farmers, farm labourers and commoners in his constituency were backing the chief minister’s plan to decentralise development. He said that agriculture labourers in the capital city were supporting the chief minister for mooting the development of all regions.

He said Naidu had coerced farmers in the capital city area when he was at the helm and made attempts to take over green fields. He said that Naidu and his benamis purchased massive extent of land in the capital city area before the official announcement and made huge gain.

Alla said that Naidu had started pooling donations to run the movement for Amaravati after making all farmers, particularly the Dalits, paupers.

He asked the DGP to immediately remove the tents laid in the capital city area if they wanted to implement the Section 144 of CrPC without bias.

Meanwhile, Tirupati legislator Bhumana Karunakar Reddy flagged off a massive rally in the temple city of Tirupati in support of the state government’s three capitalproposal on Monday. Holding ‘Thank you CM’ placards, a large contingent of students and locals took part in the rally.

Addressing the crowd after the rally, the YSRC legislator lashed out at former chief minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu for trying to politicize the government’s 3-capital proposal.

“Naidu never focused his attention on the development of the state during his tenure. The fact that even the farmers of the Amaravati region did not vote for the TDP in the 2019 general elections establishes the fact that they were all against the anti-development policies of the then chief minister,” Bhumana said.

PUNE: Special UAPA judge S R Navander on Monday said the court would not proceed any further in the Elgar Parishad case till it was verified that the nine arrested accused got the copies of the seized documents the prosecution submitted with the chargesheet.The judge directed an elaborate verification process of the documents on January 21 but clarified that the exercise was not aimed at establishing their genuineness. The verification would be only to ensure that the accused got copies of all the documents, he said in a packed courtroom.Copies of the seized documents are crucial for the accused to prepare their defence in the case. It is now at the stage of framing of charges, after the prosecution recently filed draft charges against them.The prosecution had earlier claimed to “have provided cloned copies of the entire data”, but Gadling and Ferreira disputed the claim by submitting that the documents were incomplete and far less than the 25 TB data claimed. On December 18, the court had asked the accused to appoint an expert to examine if the copies provided to them were the same as submitted to the court with the chargesheet.Defence lawyers Gaurav Jachak, Rahul Deshmukh and Rohan Nahar submitted a plea to the court naming Mumbai-based cyber law expert Supratik Chakravorty, Jachak himself, and Gadling and Ferreira as “experts” for verifying the documents.

PUNE: City-based animal rights non-government organization ( NGO ) Sarv Jeev Mangal Prathisthan has launched a round-the-clock ambulance service for those injured by nylon or Chinese manja this year.

The ambulance, launched on the eve of Makar Sankranti (on Wednesday), will be staffed by a doctor, a veterinarian, volunteers and activists. They will treat injuries to people and animals, and will be in operation till January 31.

The NGO’s founder-director, cardiologist Kalyan Gangwal, said they had decided to launch the initiative this year, considering the number of injuries caused by the banned kite string. “In the past 17 years, our team has been at the forefront, trying to ensure that the ban on nylon and Chinese manja is being properly implemented and sufficient action is taken on the sellers,” Gangwal said on Monday.

He said many have lost their lives to this manja over the past few years, and more were injured. “In July 2017, the National Green Tribunal imposed a blanket ban on nylon and synthetic manja, as it posed a serious threat to humans and animals. However, many small vendors still sell it openly,” he said.

Gangwal claimed that around 2,000 people have been killed by nylon manja over the years. “We try to hold awareness sessions among schoolchildren to not use this manja. We have also launched this initiative. We have told residents from slums to bring us the manja they find entwined in tree branches. If they bring us half a kilo of this manja, we reward them with Rs500. We have been running this initiative for a few years,” he said.

412,['14/01/2020'],Nizam-era press closure triggers job loss fears,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Secunderabad: As the date of railway printing presses being shut down nears, there is unrest among employees and railway unions, who are claiming that 98% of travel is still done by unreserved tickets despite the upgradation of the ticketing system.

The decision has not gone down well with members of several railway unions and employees. Before the Nizam-era railway press in Secunderabad shuts down in March 2020, the printing press staff is not only expected to print extra tickets for creating a buffer but they need to employ more people on a temporary basis.

“Nearly 70% of the people working there are underqualified men, women and differently-abled people, and employees are finding it hard to find further employment. Until the digitisation of tickets reaches close to even 50%, there is no need to close down the printing presses,” a source told TOI. “Even at those nice presses which have already been shut down, the Machinery and Plant (M&P) stand in a dilapidated condition without any buyers. The land is also not in the best of locations to have enough takers,” he added.

Railway unions fear that this is another step towards privatisation of the Railways.

“Passenger Reservation System (PRS), Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) tickets and money value items should be continued in the above five printing presses till complete closure of the presses. The passes and the privilege ticket orders (PTOs) should be printed covering the requirements upto the year 2020-21. However all the printing activities should be stopped by March 31, 2020,” states the letter by the Railway Board to the general managers of Indian Railway (IR) zones in June 2019.

The statement talked about shutting down of five presses including the press at Secunderabad (South Central Railway), Central Railway press in Byculla, Howrah (Eastern Railway), Delhi (Northern Railway) and Chennai (Southern Railway).

“While maximum passengers using train services are not equipped to handle digital platforms, how will the railway suddenly stop printing paper tickets? A few private companies will get business worth several crores. We are still against this move,” K Sivakumar, divisional secretary, SCR Mazdoor union told TOI.

According to the employees in distress, the major chunk of travel is done in the unreserved category where passengers are issued tickets manually.

Across the country, more than 340 crore unreserved tickets are being issued annually, which means 10 lakh tickets are being issued per day.

Trichy: Trichy Corporation has floated a tender for refurbishing the infrastructure of two corporation schools in Ariyamangalam zone here. The work, which will include strengthening the existing buildings and adding new infrastructure, is scheduled to commence in a month and completed in three months.

Utilising the education fund for 2018-19, the corporation has planned to improve infrastructure in 74 schools in a phased manner. The tender has been fixed at Rs 16 lakh to redevelop Varaganeri (north) corporation middle school and Majlis-ul-Ulama Corporation elementary school on Madurai road.

Apart from renovating and strengthening the ceiling and flooring of the buildings, the civic body has planned to paint social messages and graffiti on the compound walls of the two schools. To overhaul the school’s appearance, the walls facing the front portion of the school will be clad with aluminium sheets.

“Announcement system in all classrooms and a microphone in the headmaster’s room will be provided. We have planned for a uniform exterior colour for all schools,” a corporation official said. The civic body said the proposal was a follow-up of a consultative meeting conducted with headmasters of all 74 corporation schools to hear their requirements to improve infrastructure. “Smart classrooms proposal is also on the cards for corporation schools to increase enrolment of students,” the official added.

Vijayawada: Civil society group Human Rights Forum lauded the government on Monday over its decision to shift the capital from Amaravati, even as it criticised the opaque manner in which it was going about deciding the future of the capital city.

“The decision has merit. This is because the social and environmental costs of a mammoth capital city like the one proposed by the erstwhile TDP government are too high. We stated this at the time of the release of the Sivaramakrishnan report in 2014 and we reiterate it now. The city (Amaravati) was to be constructed on an abundantly fertile river floodplain, on wetlands and in an area that is also a seismic zone. It was a veritable nightmare in the making,” A Chandrasekhar and VS Krishna, members of the HRF’s coordination committee for AP and Telangana, said in a statement.

HRF, however, cautioned the YSRC government against treading the path of its predecessor in the matter of responding to agitations. “Section 144 is being clamped and prohibitory orders under section 30 of the Police Act are being promulgated the moment there is a protest. We condemn the use of excessive and unwarranted force by police on farmers in the Amaravati area,” they added.

They urged the government to initiate a dialogue with the agitators instead of adopting an adversarial position. “We understand that the entire exercise of reverting the land to landowners is a cumbersome process and in some instances next to impossible. However, that does not diminish the responsibility of the government to find an amicable and just solution to the issue,” they said.

They also criticised the government for lack of transparency and added thata centralised secretariat in Visakhapatnam, or for that matter anywhere else, is undesirable. “Rather, there must be several mini-secretariats dispersed across the state. We feel the high court must come up in Rayalaseema and ideally in a relatively central location,” Krishna and Chandrasekhar said in the statement.

Of the 10 donor-recipient pairs, six are from Gujarat, three from Rajasthan and one from Madhya Pradesh, said ... Read More

AHMEDABAD: In a first, medical experts at Institute of Kidney Diseases & Research Centre ( IKDRC ) carried out a single-centre kidney exchange (swap or cross) transplant chain of 10 recipients and 10 donors from January 5 to 13.

Dr Vineet Mishra, director of IKDRC, said that often the potential kidney donors are not the exact match for the patient.

“In such a case, we try to find the closest match among the other donors and find whether the organs can be transplanted in pairs. This is the best way for patients with incompatible donors to be transplanted quickly with the best results,” he said. “Kidney transplant chain is more effective in saving lives for difficult to match donor-recipient pair.”

Out of 10 donor-recipient pairs, six are from Gujarat , three from Rajasthan and one from Madhya Pradesh, said IKDRC officials.

The officials claimed that it’s the longest such chain in India and perhaps in Asia.

Vivek Kute, the transplant coordinator, said that when a donor-recipient pair is incompatible because of differences in blood type or other tissue sensitivities, donors within the exchange are swapped among incompatible pairs to allow for more transplants.

“Allocating donated kidneys to deserving patients with end-stage renal disease is an important challenge in today's health care system. Patients typically must wait as long as 2 to 5 years to receive a kidney from a deceased donor,” he said. He added that having a living donor can eliminate the wait. But in one-third of such cases, a transplant can’t be done because the immune systems of the patient and a willing donor don’t match. “The last of the cases would be performed on Saturday, completing the chain. All the patients are healthy and are responding well,” he said.

NEW DELHI: Former Delhi law minister Jitender Singh Tomar and MLA from Tri Nagar assembly constituency has been fielded by AAP from the seat for the third time Tomar has been embroiled in an alleged fake degree controversy after he was arrested by Delhi Police on June 8, 2015, on charges of cheating and fraud in obtaining the degree from Tilka Manjhi College in Bhagalpur. An FIR was registered against him at the Hauz Khas police station, and on July 24, 2015, he was granted conditional bail by a court with a direction to join the police investigation. Police filed a chargesheet in March 2018 at a Saket court .Coming at a time when the AAP government was locked in a tussle with the then lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung over its powers, Tomar’s arrest led to AAP alleging political vendetta.Tomar was first fielded by AAP from Tri Nagar during the 2013 Delhi assembly elections but lost to Nand Kishore Garg of Bharatiya Janata Party by a margin of 2,809 votes. In the 2015 assembly election, however, he defeated Garg by a margin of 22,311 votes.“In the last election, I had won by nearly 23,000 votes, and this time, I will win by a margin of 40,000,” Tomar told TOI. When asked if the alleged fake degree controversy might affect his electoral prospects this time, Tomar said he preferred to talk about the developmental work he has done in his constituency. “It was complete political vendetta against me. The case is now in a fast-track court and is going in my favour,” said Tomar. He said he hoped to be acquitted in about six months to a year.“I have executed around 600 developmental work in my constituency in the past five years. These include development of roads, improvement of water supply and sewerage, setting up of community centres and mohalla clinics, construction of foot overbridges and open gyms and installation of 2,000 CCTV cameras, etc.,” he said. Tomar said people of Delhi were very happy with the work done by the AAP government and would vote for the party everywhere overwhelmingly.Tomar had resigned from the party in June 2015. In July 2018, a Delhi court ordered framing of charges against him stating that submitting “forged” certificates seemed to be part of a larger conspiracy. Tomar had claimed in his defence that the court did not have jurisdiction in the case since the admission to LLB course had been taken in Bihar.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Some protesters of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on Monday approached the Gujarat high court complaining that the city police do not grant them permission to protest peacefully.

To the petition seeking direction to cops to grant permission to protest against the new law, Justice A Y Kogje said that police should take decision on the application in time.

Petitioners Mudita Vidrohi and Mujahid Nafees contended that while the state administration has granted permission on 62 occasions to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to hold programmes in support of CAA, it has been denying permission to protesters. Denial of permission to protest peacefully is in violation of people’s fundamental rights.

The petitioners want to stage a protest on January 19 in Jamalpur area and for this they applied for permission on January 5. They met the Gaekwad Haveli police inspector on January 7, but he did not reply to their request. The next day, they went to see the city police commissioner, who redirected them to the police inspector. However, they did not hear anything from the authority with regard to permission.

The petitioners argued that the ruling party has applied for and received permission on the very same day for 62 public meetings across the state. On the other hand, the petitioners were denied permission on various occasions, though they had protested against CAA peacefully last month.

The petitioners also complained that the continuous imposition of Section 144 of CrPC prohibiting meeting of more than four persons in public automatically makes the protesters offenders if the protest without police permission.

They also complained that the cops take action only against the protesters and not against the supporters of the law.

Since, the city police did not respond to their request for permission for a protest programme, they approached the HC. The court directed the authorities to take a decision on the application in accordance with law and ensure that the decision is taken in time, so that the application does not become infructuous. The police, thus, will have to decide before January 19.

AHMEDABAD: With overcast sky almost the entire day on Monday and strong winds, the kitists — waiting for the big day for almost the entire year — prayed for a good weather on Uttarayan. India meteorological department (IMD) forecast is the clouds will vanish after passing of the western disturbance.

City kite markets were busy till late night as Amdavadis shopped for panja, gundarpatti and dhal by bargaining hard. The roads leading to Raipur were choc-a-block despite Monday witnessing an overcast sky.

“Uttarayan is not just a festival for the city, it’s a ritual for the residents of the Walled City with friendly rivalries across the terraces and almost the entire area living a day basking in the sun. We have planned to visit Khadia with our friends in the afternoon to make the most of the festival,” said Jayesh Shah, a resident of Vejalpur.

Jayanta Sarkar, regional director, IMD, said that morning’s induced cyclonic circulation resulted in light showers in some parts of north Gujarat on Monday and also caused the dense cloudy weather in a few pockets. “But by Tuesday, the sky will clear up and there is no possibility of rain. We expect the wind to be also moderate which is good for kite-flying,” he said.

The city, which witnessed 24.9°C and 17.5°C maximum and minimum temperatures on Monday — 2.8 degrees lower and 5.3 degrees higher than the normal — is likely to record minimum temperature of 14°C on Tuesday.

Across the state, minimum temperature is likely to fall by 3°C to 4°C on Tuesday and Wednesday. ‘Thereafter further fall in minimum temperature over the region very likely,’ mentioned the forecast. Despite rise in minimum temperature, strong cold winds forced the citizens to don the woollens.

“Uttarayan is the festival of the sun. We were surprised to see the weather on Monday where clouds almost covered the sun for the most of the morning. We hope that it’s not the case on Tuesday as we have already made all the grand preparations for the big day, complete with the terrace feast, music and of course lots of kites,” said Sujay Trivedi, a professional and resident of Vastrapur.

Students always face problems during the admission period. Many a time, students don’t know what scholarships are available and how to apply for them. Even when it comes to admissions, students need guidance when it comes to applying for one and cancelling the admission in a college if one gets allotment in a better college. There are also doubts about how much money will be refunded during if one goes for cancelling the admission in a college. With a single point of contact, the entire process will become easier,” Jahnvi Nair, who is hoping to take admission for a postgraduate (PG) course this year in the city, said.In the absence of admission coordinators, students have to run from pillar to post to get their doubts cleared, she said, citing the work pressure on college staffers to properly guide students.The admission coordinators will also be responsible for spreading awareness of circulars issued from university among students, besides declaring the admission schedule in the colleges and coordinating in the admission process.Dilip Sheth, principal of SP College, said, “This is a good initiative to help students during the admission period. We generally appoint vice-principals as coordinators during the admissions. I think a better move will be to have one coordinator and then faculty-wise coordinators. Because professor of one stream will know more about his/her own discipline than the professor from other streams.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73244994,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-534518,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/colleges-to-assign-admission-coordinators-to-guide-pupils/articleshow/73235226.cms

Jitender Singh Tomar was arrested by Delhi Police on June 8, 2015, on charges of fraud. (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Former Delhi law minister Jitender Singh Tomar and MLA from Tri Nagar assembly constituency has been fielded by AAP from the seat for the third time .

Tomar has been embroiled in an alleged fake degree controversy after he was arrested by Delhi Police on June 8, 2015, on charges of cheating and fraud in obtaining the degree from Tilka Manjhi College in Bhagalpur. An FIR was registered against him at the Hauz Khas police station, and on July 24, 2015, he was granted conditional bail by a court with a direction to join the police investigation. Police filed a chargesheet in March 2018 at a Saket court .

Coming at a time when the AAP government was locked in a tussle with the then lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung over its powers, Tomar’s arrest led to AAP alleging political vendetta.

Tomar was first fielded by AAP from Tri Nagar during the 2013 Delhi assembly elections but lost to Nand Kishore Garg of Bharatiya Janata Party by a margin of 2,809 votes. In the 2015 assembly election, however, he defeated Garg by a margin of 22,311 votes.

“In the last election, I had won by nearly 23,000 votes, and this time, I will win by a margin of 40,000,” Tomar told TOI. When asked if the alleged fake degree controversy might affect his electoral prospects this time, Tomar said he preferred to talk about the developmental work he has done in his constituency. “It was complete political vendetta against me. The case is now in a fast-track court and is going in my favour,” said Tomar. He said he hoped to be acquitted in about six months to a year.

“I have executed around 600 developmental work in my constituency in the past five years. These include development of roads, improvement of water supply and sewerage, setting up of community centres and mohalla clinics, construction of foot overbridges and open gyms and installation of 2,000 CCTV cameras, etc.,” he said. Tomar said people of Delhi were very happy with the work done by the AAP government and would vote for the party everywhere overwhelmingly.

Tomar had resigned from the party in June 2015. In July 2018, a Delhi court ordered framing of charges against him stating that submitting “forged” certificates seemed to be part of a larger conspiracy. Tomar had claimed in his defence that the court did not have jurisdiction in the case since the admission to LLB course had been taken in Bihar. But the court went ahead saying the marksheet was used in Delhi.

Pune: Four Nana Peth residents, including two women, were booked on Sunday on the charges of posing as finance firm officials and duping 70 self-help group members of Rs 3.8 lakh on the pretext of providing them cheap loans.

The Samarth police said all the fraud victims were involved in household business and operated from an office on NDA Road. One of the office-bearers of the self-help group (SHG), a resident of Kondhwe village, has lodged a complaint with the police in this regard.

All the SHG members belonged to economically backward section of the society, the police said.

According to the FIR, the suspects approached the SHG office in 2016. “They told the members that they had their offices in Nana Peth and Hadapsar. They then promised them loans at cheaper interest rates,” an officer of the Samarth police said.

After the members agreed to take the loans, the suspects charged members Rs 1,200 each for the loan form and Rs 2,000 each in loan-processing fee. In all, the suspects took Rs 3.80 lakh from the women, the officer said.

When their loans were not processed, the SHG members approached both the offices of the finance firm, but found them locked, prompting them to lodge a complaint.

SECUNDERABAD: As the date of railway printing presses being shut down nears, there is unrest among employees and railway unions, who are claiming that 98% of travel is still done by unreserved tickets despite the upgradation of the ticketing system.

The decision has not gone down well with members of several railway unions and employees. Before the Nizam-era railway press in Secunderabad shuts down in March 2020, the printing press staff is not only expected to print extra tickets for creating a buffer but they need to employ more people on a temporary basis.

“Nearly 70% of the people working there are underqualified men, women and differently-abled people, and employees are finding it hard to find further employment. Until the digitisation of tickets reaches close to even 50%, there is no need to close down the printing presses,” a source told TOI. “Even at those nice presses which have already been shut down, the Machinery and Plant (M&P) stand in a dilapidated condition without any buyers. The land is also not in the best of locations to have enough takers,” he added.

Railway unions fear that this is another step towards privatisation of the Railways.

“Passenger Reservation System (PRS), Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) tickets and money value items should be continued in the above five printing presses till complete closure of the presses. The passes and the privilege ticket orders (PTOs) should be printed covering the requirements upto the year 2020-21. However all the printing activities should be stopped by March 31, 2020,” states the letter by the Railway Board to the general managers of Indian Railway (IR) zones in June 2019.

The statement talked about shutting down of five presses including the press at Secunderabad (South Central Railway), Central Railway press in Byculla, Howrah (Eastern Railway), Delhi (Northern Railway) and Chennai (Southern Railway).

“While maximum passengers using train services are not equipped to handle digital platforms, how will the railway suddenly stop printing paper tickets? A few private companies will get business worth several crores. We are still against this move,” K Sivakumar, divisional secretary, SCR Mazdoor union told TOI.

According to the employees in distress, the major chunk of travel is done in the unreserved category where passengers are issued tickets manually.

Across the country, more than 340 crore unreserved tickets are being issued annually, which means 10 lakh tickets are being issued per day.

PUDUKOTTAI: The forest department arrested three men for hunting three peafowls near Annavasal in Pudukottai district on Monday. A country-made unlicensed gun, a motorcycle and carcasses of the three peafowls were seized from them.

The arrested have been identified as C Perumal, 25, P Moorthy, 26 and S Arumugam, 26. Inquiry has brought to light that the three had poached the peafowls for meat and this was not their first attempt.

They were caught by the Annavasal police during a vehicle check near Vayalogam village on Sunday night. The trio were handed over to the forest officials on Monday morning.

Peafowls are protected under Schedule – I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Poaching them is a non-bailable offence.

Pudukottai district forest officer M Anand Kumar said they had secured one more person who had supplied raw materials to the trio to make ammunition for poaching.

“Unlike these habitual offenders, people living close to the forest areas indulge in poaching without knowing that such acts can put them behind bars. We have been sensitizing them to keep away from such activities,” said Anand.

A case has been booked under Section 9 of the Wildlife Protection Act against the three.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Several city roads and the 20-km-long stretch of National Highway (NH)-16 that passes through Vizag wore a deserted look on Monday as residents left for home ahead of Sankranti .

Close to 60 per cent, or around 23 lakh, of the city’s populations comprises migrants from neighbouring Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, East and West Godavari districts.

While Sankranti will be celebrated on Wednesday, Bhogi—the first day of the festival—is on Tuesday.

Crowds, however, converged at railway and bus stations with passengers in a rush to reach home. An official of the public transport department said, “A total of 300 special buses along various routes, including 100 buses to Hyderabad, have been pressed into service to meet the demand this year.”

An official spokesperson of Waltair division of East Coast Railway said that nearly 40 special trains are being operated to clear the rush of passengers at Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, Srikakulam and Parvathipuram in north-coastal AP.

Meanwhile, junctions at Maddilapalem, Dwarakanagar bus station, Visakhapatnam railway station , NAD Junction, Hanumanthwaka Junction and Madhurawada were packed with passengers

“My family has already left for home town at Palasa. I will join them on Tuesday night,” said B Sridhar, a faculty member of Andhra University at Sivajipalem.

The harvest festival marks the transition of the sun into Capricorn (‘Makara Rasi’) .

AMARAVATI: The high-level committee comprising cabinet ministers and senior officials held another round of deliberations on decentralisation of the administration on Monday.

The committee, which is looking into the experts committee reports on the capital city and comprehensive development of the state, chalked out plans to put developmental activities on fast track. The committee also discussed issues of farmers in the capital city area.

Speaking to media after the meeting, transport, I&PR minister Perni Venkataramaiah (Nani) appealed to farmers in the Amaravati region to submit their concerns, suggestions or complaints to the CRDA Commissioner before January 17.

He said the government would go through all suggestions and complaints at the committee’s next meeting on January 17. “We are advising farmers either to visit the CRDA office or reach out to CRDA commissioner through mails,” Nani suggested. He said the YSRC government is farmer-friendly and would not do injustice to real farmers.

Perni Nani said that the government was ready to discuss any issue to be raised by farmers. He said the government would consider issues of farmers in the capital city area with compassion. “We are appealing to them not to fall into the political trap laid by Chandrababu Naidu. Except Naidu and his benamis, every genuine farmer will get justice under the YSRC regime,” said Nani.

He said several delegations of farmers have met municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana and submitted their grievances. He said the ministers were giving patient audience to all those who are genuinely raising their grievances. He said the committee had discussed major development projects to be initiated in every district.

Agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu lambasted Naidu for creating uncertainty in the Amaravati region for his political gains. “It is quite sad that he is not leaving farmers in peace even for Sankranti. How sad it is to appeal to people not to celebrate the festival. People should celebrate festivals when Naidu is happy and should not when Naidu is on the streets,” said Kannababu. He also condemned Naidu describing DGP Sawang as a northeast person.

Meanwhile, farmers from the capital villages met municipal administration minister Satyanaraya at his residence in Vijayawada and explained their apprehensions. They detailed their fears regarding the shifting of the capital. The farmers requested the minister to return land that was not in use for the capital region.

Pune: At a time when protests mount against CAA, NRC and the documentation required for both, a study has found that women belonging to nomadic tribes in Maharashtra face extreme difficulties in getting documents and all women above the age of 25 in the rural areas are illiterate. This was revealed by the Status of Women in India report released on Monday at Balgandharva Rangmandir .

The survey for the report, prepared by Drishti Stree Adhyayan Prabodhan Kendra, an RSS affiliate women’s organisation in Pune, was conducted in 29 states and five union territories and over 70,000 women across India were interviewed. The report said 55.2% of the women in India are unemployed while arthritis affects 44%.

The report also spoke about 78% women of Jammu & Kashmir’s border areas feeling insecure about the cross border firing and shelling while 39% women from the border area of West Bengal feel insecure due to communal atrocities, hooliganism and torture stemming from religious tension.

Talking about school curricula from gender perspective, Maneesha Kothekar, project director said, “The percentage of women academicians involved in curriculum committee is poor, non-significant and non-influential. The percentage of women authors or women related content is very less and portrayal of women and leaders and contributors is also poor.”

Vocational training, in-depth study on better health, prevention and treatment of menstrual health, leadership training, gender sensitisation programmes were the recommendations made by the study.

Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh joint general secretary Krishna Gopal, who was the chief guest at the function, said, “The report says that Aadhaar has reached 90.6% of women, yet there is a huge gap in the northeastern region. The literacy rate in northeastern region is high yet Aadhaar has reached only 54% population.” Krishna Gopal added that the status of women in ancient India was higher than that of men and emphasised on the importance of families to teach young boys to respect women.

SECUNDERABAD: While implementing measures aimed at harnessing renewable energy and conserving energy, the South Central Railway (SCR) is reducing energy costs through the installation of solar panels at stations, service buildings and Level Crossing gates across the zone.

According to SCR, over 55 railway stations are being provided with solar plants across the zone, including at Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Kacheguda and in each region alone, the SCR has saved over Rs 1 crore per annum with solar power since December last year. “One of the significant actions taken in this direction has been the installation of solar panels at stations and service buildings across the zone,” read a statement from the Indian Railways.

SCR is also focusing on providing solar roofs to small establishments and wayside railway stations which in turn helps save energy and costs while ensuring uninterrupted power supply. “The eco-friendly initiatives will be extended to major stations where power consumption is high. The use of star-labelled electrical equipment, LED fittings, energy-efficient pumps, provision of occupancy sensors, etc has helped in saving energy,” said SCR.

Trichy: Coming under heavy criticism over the reservation policy adopted for direct recruitment to 54 regular teaching positions, Bharathidasan University (BDU) has postponed the process indefinitely.

The university has circulated an internal communication to the staff and the selection committee to stop the recruitment process. The university was set to conduct interviews on January 21 for around 1,400 applicants.

The move comes after higher education minister K P Anbalagan directed the university to get clearance from the personnel and administrative reforms (P&AR) department before going ahead with the recruitment.

“We received a few complaints pointing flaws in the recruitment process adopted by the university about the reservation policy. I have asked the university to get clearance from the personnel and administrative reforms department to verify the claims of disparity in the roster system adopted for the recruitment,” higher education minister K P Anbalagan told TOI.

“There is no second thought that the university must go ahead only if they get clearance from P&AR. That is the procedure or else they will have to postpone the recruitment process until they get clearance,” he added.

The university is unlikely to get clearance from P&AR as the roster system adopted by it was against the policy of the state government. “P&AR being an advisory department will not take a stand against the state policy. Therefore, the university needs to mend its way,” said a senior official from the higher education department.

The university had called for applications in July last year. It followed the Union government ordinance introduced in March last year restoring 200-point roster for recruitment by considering the whole university as a single unit for calculating vacancies.

A letter dated August 28 from the higher education secretary had asked all the 13 state universities to treat each department as single unit to reserve teaching posts for professors, associate professors and assistant professors.

Former president of the AUT, K Pandiyan said that a state-run university cannot have an exclusive reservation policy. Only the state government can decide on what policy has to be adopted. “AUT all along wanted a uniform policy adopted by other state universities. But vice-chancellor P Manisankar unilaterally changed the policy of reservation without consulting any stake holder,” he said.

VIJAYAWADA: This Sankranti season, moviegoers in the city have complained that they are being fleeced by multiplexes.

Usually, a movie ticket at a multiplex costs between Rs 150 to Rs 175. But following the state government’s permission to hike ticket prices during festivals, theatres have increased the rates by up to 50%. So now, a regular moviegoer has to pay anywhere between Rs 225-Rs 260 to watch a movie. And that’s just the price of admission!

This year though, a few multiplexes have made ‘combo offers’ compulsory, also charging for the food they have on offer. Multiplexes are charging Rs 250 for two samosas and a soft drink or popcorn and soft drink, over and above the cost of a movie ticket. Consequently, a film buff ended up paying about Rs 500 for a ticket.

“While online a few multiplexes showed housefull, the same multiplexes sold tickets at the counter on combo offer. We were forced to by popcorn and soft drink for Rs 180 along with the movie ticket,” said K Nagendra Kumar, a BTech student.

Trichy: The state government continues to evade the demand for a tripartite meeting to discuss paddy procurement policy, allege farmers in the state. While both the ministers for food and agriculture hail from delta districts, they have not shown any interest in convening the same for long, they add.

Before announcing the procurement policy for the kharif season, the state government would usually convene a tripartite meeting where agriculture and food ministers, Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) MD, collectors of delta districts, officials from the agriculture department, TNCSC regional managers and representatives of farmers’ associations would participate.

“After the demise of chief minister J Jayalalithaa, the meeting has not been convened to discuss paddy procurement,” secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, Swamimalai S Vimalnathan said.

“Every year, tripartite meeting would be conducted in any one of the districts in the delta before the commencement of DPCs. This year cultivable lands have gone up to 11 lakh acres following good monsoon and continuous flow in the Cauvery. Now, harvest has commenced in many parts of the districts. There are a number of issues revolving around DPCs across the delta districts that need to be resolved. In this situation it is unfair that the meeting is not convened,” he said.

“Even agriculture minister R Doraikannu from Thanjavur and food minister R Kamaraj from Tiruvaur have not instructed officials to convene the meeting. The tripartite meeting should be conducted and farmers’ grievances with regard to paddy procurement should be heard,” he added.

Farmers would be given Rs 1,835 per quintal for A-grade paddy with Rs 70 as state government’s incentive. In case of common variety, Rs 1,815 will be disbursed to the farmers along with Rs 50 as an incentive.

Pune Municipal Corporation

PUNE: Manpower crunch can crush the civic body’s wish to operate some of the parking lots in the city to curb complaints about rude behaviour of contractors .

According to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s rough estimate, nearly 10 people are required to look after the operations of a parking lot . Besides, two supervisors and a clerk are also required. The PMC is mulling over issuing tenders afresh to run the trouble-hit parking lots because of non-availability of staffers.

A PMC official said the civic administration had decided to take over the pay and park facilities and operate them with civic staffers if the contractors concerned did not pay the dues. The PMC even sealed parking lots over unpaid dues. “The parking facilities that are not being operated properly will be taken over by the PMC. The civic administration has taken over a parking lot near Phule market and it is being run successfully. We shall decide about the other lots if manpower is available,” said Rajendra Muthe, the head of the PMC’s estate and management department.

Nearly 26 pay and park lots, including the mechanised parking lot on J M Road, have been set up in the city. Many of the private operators running them have not paid the rent to the PMC and the arrears is pegged at Rs2 crore.

The PMC had approached the Lok Adalat to recover the pending rent of the civic properties, including the parking lots. The corporation subsequently recovered Rs30 lakh from the operators.

Civic activists said people with political connections were running the parking lots and creating obstacles in their smooth functioning. “Most of the parking lots have been given to political workers for operation, who charge exorbitant fees. The staff members working at these facilities misbehave with citizens, but action is hardly taken,” said Vijay Kumbhar of Surajya Sangharsha Samittee, a citizens’ group.

Visakhapatnam: In an attempt to check efforts by Maoists to attract tribal youth, the CRPF is conducting various programme in the agency areas. As part of the paramilitary force’s tribal youth exchange programme in coordination with Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS), the 234 battalion of the CRPF sent 60 boys and girls to Kolkata on Tuesday.

They will get to visit different places of cultural, individual, historical, religious and educational importance. We will organise more programmes like this to provide opportunity to others in the agency area in the coming days,” Balapurkar said.

He added that such programmes will help them understand the socio-economic development, cultural ethics, language, and lifestyle of people depicting the unity in diversity aspect of our social fabric, besides making them aware of the social and financial inclusion programmes of the government,” he said, while adding that they earlier organised a similar programme for 30 boys and girls aged below 22 years age in Jaipur.

437,['14/01/2020'],PM Narendra Modi’s ‘political speech’ draws Ramakrishna Mission alumni ire,"Narendra Modi

By: Swarnali DuttaKOLKATA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pro-CAA statements from the Ramakrishna Mission’s Belur headquarters have evoked sharp response from the RKM alumni.Iterating that RKM has always stayed away from politics, retired RBI officer Asoke Chattopadhyay said: “Anyone who has read Swami Vivekananda’s writings knows he has always valued inclusivity. Vivekananda has always stressed that it is a person’s work and action that define them, nothing else. RKM should have been kept above politics.” Kamalesh Dasgupta, who teaches in Jodhpur Park Boys’ School, added: “If the PM truly believes in the ethos RKM stands for, he could have never used that platform to say what he did on CAA . Speaking on politics is also disrespecting RKM. One shouldn’t use it to further a political agenda. He could have said those anywhere, but certainly not Belur Math. I am pained.”Author Ranjan Roy, 69, felt it would have been good if the PM had not spoken about CAA in Belur Math. “Delivering a speech on CAA in a place where Vivekananda has always propagated thought of inclusiveness is not only misplaced but wrong. The RKM defended itself saying it was the PM’s opinion and they did not have much say on what guests say. But I find it hard to understand.”Spine surgeon Sanjoy Biswas said: “I don’t understand why the PM visited Belur Math. If he had been there to be a part of 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, why did he speak on CAA? Instead he could have spoken on what steps are being taken to curb unemployment, and use the platform to motivate the young generation. As an ex-student of the Mission I don’t support that my alma mater be used as a base to further political agendas at all. Ramakrishna Mission has always been inclusive and stayed away from politics,” Biswas said.For private engineering college teacher Himadri Ghosh, it was an “utter disgrace and shameful”. “The PM should never propagate his political ideologies from a place like Ramakrishna Mission, Belur Math. We learned a different definition of ‘religion’ during our days in Mission and whatever is happening in the name of religion in our country is shocking. I was also pained by the fact that RKM endorsed Modi as the best prime minister. It hurts us because the bond we have with the Mission is still very strong.” Debjit Maiti, who works for a pharmaceutical company, added: “The PM could have spoken on CAA somewhere else but not in Ramakrishna Mission, Belur Math. He should not have brought politics inside the mission premises.”Sharp reactions also poured in on social media in which a letter purportedly addressed to the RKM president and questioning the PM’s statement and presence in Belur Math is doing the rounds. Several social media users, who are also RKM alumni, have commented on the letter.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73241523,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-611130,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pms-political-speech-draws-rkm-alumni-ire/articleshow/73235264.cms

Vijayawada: The government has decided to issue 50,000 more agriculture power connections to farmers in the next two months. This is in addition to the existing 17.67 lakh connections across the state.

Energy minister Balineni Srinivas Reddy, at a review meeting held on Sunday, directed officials to expedite the process of issuing the new power connections. Enerdy department officials informed the minister that out of 6,663 agriculture feeders in the state, 5,200 are now capable of supplying free power with augmentation of feeders.

Balineni told officials to give top priority to supply of nine hours of free power to farmers. “Uninterrupted power to the farming sector will help in boosting productivity and will make agriculture a profitable activity,” he said, while asking them to be ready to meet the demand which is likely to increase from the month of February. “Increase in ground water levels this year may contribute to higher demand from the agriculture sector as more farmers may go for Rabi crop across the state depending on the rise in ground water level,” he added. APTransco (Andhra Pradesh transmission corporation) has also taken up a Rs 286.3 crore project to upgrade the existing infrastructure of agriculture feeders, under which substations and other infrastructure works in East and West Godavari, Krishna, Guntur and Nellore districts will be upgraded. The government has already spent Rs 7,779.5 crore towards free power subsidy to the agriculture sector and Rs 475 crore for aquaculture to supply power at a subsidised price of Rs 1.5 per unit.

As many as 54,098 power connections have been given to aquaculture farmers across the state, officials said, while adding that efforts are being made to put in place a high-voltage distribution system with an aim to reduce distribution losses in agriculture sector by 25 per cent.

440,['14/01/2020'],NIN study finds exposure to lead can cause Alzheimer’s disease,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Hyderabad: Scientists at the ICMR- National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) have established the possible link between exposure to lead and Alzheimer’s disease. Lead is a common pollutant present in a number of commonly used materials like paints, cosmetics, batteries, glass and low-grade toys.

Experts said the current findings could be a way forward in understanding the intracellular mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease.

In Alzheimer’s disease, brain cells that process, store and help recollect the information degenerate and slowly die.

A team lead by ICMR- NIN’s senior scientist Dr Suresh Challa worked on the molecular mechanism involved in the development of lead induced Alzheimer's disease through in-vitro (outside a living organism) studies.

Dr Suresh Challa said that Alzheimer’s disease has a complex patho-physiology which involves initially; formation of beta amyloid plaques and tangles in the brain.

“Oxidative stress and inflammation are known to be involved in the progression of the disease, with loss of memory and neuronal cell death. In this scenario, our study investigated the basic molecular mechanism behind the involvement of lead in Alzheimer’s disease,” said Dr Challa.

The scientists also studied various biochemicals available in food which can slow down the progression of the disease. “Foods like green tea, guava leaves, apples, cherries, pears and black berries, which possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and metal chelant properties were studied. Their ability to effectively permeate brain and modify several cell survival signalling pathways shows they have preventive and therapeutic potential,” he added.

Moreover, the effects of environmental exposure to lead can also be passed onto a child from a pregnant mother.

“Maternal exposure to lead during pregnancy can cause developmental reprogramming which can lead to higher risk and early onset of Alzheimer’s disease in later life of the child,” said Dr R Hemalatha, director, ICMR-NIN, and added that the study is a step forward in understanding Alzheimer’s disease and developing preventing strategies for the elderly.

Hyderabad: Nampally metropolitan criminal court on Monday convicted Shaikh Saifullah Khalid, secretary Darsgah-E-Jihad-O-Shahadat ( DJS ) and a practising lawyer for allegedly assaulting a policeman.

In August 2009, during an Eid Milap meeting of DJS activists under the leadership of its former chief Shaikh Mahboob Ali, Khurshid Hussain, the then-head constable attached to Special Branch tried to cover the meeting upon which Shaikh Mahboob Ali and his son Shaikh Saifullah Khalid objected to his presence and allegedly used force to make him leave the place.

The special branch cop had filed a complaint with the Moghalpura police upon which a case under IPC sections 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 506 (Criminal intimidation) was registered against Khalid. The police later filed a chargesheet in 8th Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate against DJS secretary for abated action against former DJS chief Shaikh Mahboob Ali since he died in August 2013. After the trial, the magistrate on Monday sentenced Khalid to 2 years imprisonment and imposed fine of Rs 1,000. “I will file an appeal against the lower court order before the sessions court,” said Khalid.

443,['14/01/2020'],Delimitation of corpn wards full of discrepancies: MLA,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Madurai: Delimitation of corporation wards in Madurai has been done without following the rules, in connivance with some politicians, and elections to the Madurai Corporation council should not be held with setting it right, said Madurai Central DMK MLA P T R Palanivel Rajan.

Speaking to reporters here on Monday, he alleged that the delimitation exercise of the 100 wards seemed to have been done in a planned and partial manner to benefit some people. “This is not about the elections. We want the elections to be conducted as much as the others, because an MLA can serve the people of his constituency only with the help of councillors in the wards,” he said.

Rules of the Delimitation Act of 2003 of the central government specify that the delimitation should be done only after the five-year period of an MLA is completed. If it is done before, the people who voted would not be able to enjoy the development works from that particular MLA’s funds, as they would move to another assembly constituency. Each corporation ward should be within the same assembly constituency, but under the current delimitation process, there are some wards which are in two assembly constituencies.

There were a lot of discrepancies in the population of a ward, when compared to the 2011 census and the latest voter list. For Madurai Central, the population as per the 2011 census is 21,02,35 but according to the latest voter list the number is 236,039. The delimitation has been done based on the census data, which is a big mistake, he said. In this constituency, the population is higher than the census data in 16 wards.

As per delimitation rules, the population in the wards should be uniform with a 10% increase or decrease, but in this delimitation process, 35 wards had very less population.

Reservation for women and dalits should be done in wards which have more women or dalit populations. But, this rule had not been followed in the wards reserved for women.

In some wards where the delimitation favoured the ruling party, they got more wards. For instance, Madurai West constituency only had 15 wards earlier but now has 22 while Madurai Central has lost six wards.

445,['14/01/2020'],BJP likely to bank on youth brigade,"This story is from January 14, 2020

New Delhi: Several sitting municipal councillors are likely to contest the assembly polls on a BJP ticket. Sources said the party has decided to field “as many” young candidates and might place its bet on councillors who have gained exposure in electoral politics over the past two years.

With the growing influence of Poorvanchalis in Delhi, BJP is likely to give them a larger representation this time. Sources said several constituencies, which have a large number of unauthorised colonies, might get Poorvanchali candidates. The ruling AAP has over a dozen MLAs with their roots in eastern UP and Bihar. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari is from Poorvanchal.

In the 2017 municipal polls, BJP had fielded new candidates on all 272 wards. The effort paid off as the party won 181 seats.

“The committee has already held several rounds of meetings and the candidature of 50 councillors was discussed. About 30 sitting councillors may get the final nod to contest,” said a party functionary.

Six serving councillors had contested the 2013 assembly polls, of which three had won. In 2015, 18 sitting and former councillors had contested, but only one — Vijender Gupta from Rohini — had managed to win.

The committee will also have to decide on finalising the seat-sharing arrangement with Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), its old ally. While SAD (Badal) has sought four seats, sources said BJP might give it three. Another party functionary said the election committee has shortlisted one candidate on about 25 seats, while 2-3 potential names have been decided for 10-15 more seats. “The final list will be announced only after the central election committee takes a call. We hope to come out with the first list in a couple of days,” he added.

From the thousands of applications, about 1,400 have been shortlisted by the state committee. Sources said the list was further brought down to 450 and sent to the central committee.

The initial decision-makers include Union minister and Delhi election in-charge Prakash Javadekar, co-in-charges Hardeep Singh Puri and Nityanand Rai, general secretary (organisation) BL Santosh, Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel, Manoj Tiwari and Vijender Gupta.

KOLKATA: When comedian and lyricist Varun Grover swept social media by first tweeting a video with his poem ‘Kagaz Nahi Dikhayenge’ (We Will Not Show Our Papers), he had mentioned being inspired by Bangla slogans. Less than a month later, filmmaker Ronny Sen roped in 13 actors, directors, author, designer, model, academic and singer-songwriter to shoot a video where they lend their voice to a Bengali translation of Grover’s poem titled ‘Kagoj Amra Dakhabo Na’.Featured in viral video are Sabyasachi Chakrabarty, Manoranjan Byapari, Swastika Mukherjee, Debalina Majumder, Konkona Sen Sharma, Nandana Sen, Ayushman Mitra, Sneha Ghosh, Chitrangada Satarupa, Madhuja Mukherjee, Tillotama Shome, Rupam Islam, Suman Mukhopadhyay and Dhritiman Chaterji.According to Chaterji, the idea behind this video was to show that “there is a large cross section of people who feel angry at what is happening”. Majumder, who was attacked by a group of men in her locality on December 22 after having organised a rally, said, “Now, we have been pushed to the wall. We have to protest.” Describing this video as a result of a “snowball” effect, Mukherjee added, “Our version of this song is a way of participating in the larger version of protest.”Actor Chitrangada Satarupa, who has attended three protest meetings, said, “The basis of this Act itself is problematic the moment religion comes in. I have grown up believing that India is a secular country. How can a law take decision on the basis of religion?”Speaking to TOI, Grover said, “I am delighted to see so many respected people lending their voice to the cause. I believe some new lines have been added and from my very limited knowledge of Bangla, I could understand that they have given it some more context and energy. I am grateful.”In his poem, he had used a line that a Bengali friend of his had WhatsApp-ed: “Wo jaat paat bolenge tum bhaat bhaat bolna” before going on to underline that “there is no copyright on these words - feel free to use them, adapt, sing, modify, create”. “I wanted the poem to be free of any restriction because at its heart, it’s a poem about freedom,” Grover said.This freedom from copyright prompted Sen to translate it and shoot the video over last two-three days.Delighted to see how youngsters have joined veterans to be a part of this movement, Chaterji said, “They are spontaneously doing it without being under the umbrella of political affiliations because they are angry at what’s happening. The ‘Kagoj Amra Dakhabo Na’ module is trying to take alternative routes to quickly generate relevant messages and put them out as quickly as possible.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73242065,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-458768,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/celebs-vow-not-to-show-papers-in-protest-video/articleshow/73235276.cms

VIJAYAWADA: This time last year, the toll plazas between Vijayawada and Hyderabad on NH65 were choked with with traffic due to the festive season. With the introduction of FASTag technology, toll plazas are noticing a paradigm shift and there are barely any queues in the plazas.

On Saturday and Sunday, while cops did find several vehicles stalled at a toll plaza to a malfunctioning FASTag scanner, by Monday, there was a huge dip in traffic.

With two highways — NH16 and NH65 — cutting across Vijayawada, major junctions like Benz Circle, NTR Circle and Ramavarapadu Ring had traffic choked up to a km long. In Panthangi toll plaza on Hyderabad-bound NH65A, a 6-km long traffic jam was seen while there was a traffic jam on the Gudur toll plaza on the Hyderabad-Warangal highway in Yadadri-Bhongir district from Friday night itself.

Traffic also came to a halt due to thick fog in areas such as Kanchikacherla, Nandigama and Keesara . Subsequently, the police put out an advisory to commuters on the route regarding the fog situation. Speaking to TOI, deputy superintendent of police (Nandigama sub-division) Ramana Murthy said that while the FASTag system has made a remarkable change in the traffic scenario, there were occasional technical problems while reading them.

“At the Keesara toll plaza, there are seven lines where four of them have been reserved for fast tag. The boom barrier automatically lifts after scanning the FASTag from a distance. There was some traffic on Saturday and Sunday morning due to heavy inflow of trucks,” Ramana Murthy told TOI. The cops also issued an advisory to the toll management that if a technical issue or if traffic is being caused because of their slow process, then they shall automatically allow that vehicle to leave without charging toll.

Meanwhile, the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) saw good response from the public for their Sankranti Sambaralu. The most popular event was the rangoli competition held at Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium (IGMS) in the city. Arrangements were made with a theme that reflected a village atmosphere. The VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh inaugurated the fest by lighting the Bhogi campfire.

There was a Bommala Koluvu (exhibition of dolls) which was a huge attraction. The rangoli competition saw participation from over 100 people.

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy is expected to participate in the closing ceremony of Sankranti Yedla Pandelu (Bull Race) at Gudivada.

448,['14/01/2020'],Probe team awaits Prudhvi’s consent for voice sample test,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Tirupati: The vigilance wing of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has intensified its probe into the infamous episode involving Tollywood actor Prudhvi Raj , who stepped down as chairman of TTD-run Sri Venkateswara Bhakti channel ( SVBC ) on Sunday after an audio clip of his alleged intimate talk with a female employee of the channel went viral.

TTD trust board chairman Y V Subba Reddy, who has asked the vigilance wing to probe the SVBC episode, said voice samples from the audio clip would be sent to the forensic lab for analysis. On Monday, vigilance wing sleuths questioned the channel’s CEO Yelamanchili Venkata Nagesh and other staff.

Sources said two woman hair stylists associated with the film industry were engaged on assignment basis by the SVBC ahead of the annual Tirumala Brahmotsavams in September 2019. Both were reportedly recommended by Prudhvi Raj. While SVBC normally pays Rs 15,000 per month to staff engaged on assignment basis, the two hair stylists were offered Rs 18,000 per month.

However, their services were terminated in November after the TTD management found irregularities in some of the appointments carried out at SVBC. It has been learnt that the voice of the woman in the audio clip belongs to one of the hair stylists. The vigilence wing sleuths are now trying to contact the woman to check the authenticity of the audio clip and also to find out if she was being harassed by Prudhvi Raj, as is being alleged.

Meanwhile, the vigilance wing is waiting for Prudhvi Raj’s consent to send his voice sample for forensic test. Though the actor said he’s ready for a vigilance enquiry into the episode, while also claiming that the voice in the audio clip was not his, there’s a legal angle to the whole thing as no police complaint has been filed yet, neither by the actor nor by the aggrieved party, and till that happens, the vigilance wing can send his voice sample only after the actor’s consent.

While stepping down as SVBC chairman on Sunday, Prudhvi Raj claimed that he had lodged a complaint with the Tirupati urban police over the issue, but sources in the police department said no complaint has been received yet, neither from him nor from the woman whose voice can be heard in the audio clip.

KOLKATA: In an effort to give relief to those living in areas under Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), the civic body will issue special passes from the mayor’s office at the KMC headquarters to those who have been victims of harassment by staffers in the borough level. The exercise is likely to begin from next month.The passes, to be issued by the mayor’s department, will allow a citizen to meet the head of departments (HoDs) of essential services at the KMC headquarters on SN Banerjee Road.“Going through the nature of complaints, the department heads will offer solutions to the aggrieved complainants. In case no prompt action can be taken, the HoD concerned will have explain the reasons and give it in writing. Under no circumstances a genuine complainant should feel neglected,” mayor Firhad Hakim said on Monday.A sources in the mayor’s office said the civic brass wanted citizens, who had been victims of ill-treatment by KMC employees, to register their protests with senior officials to the rank of director-general or chief manager. “We have taken up the matter with KMC senior officials posted at the headquarters. They have been asked to offer practical solutions to long-pending problems. We invite them to take advantage of our new system in large numbers,” said an official associated with the mayor’s office.According to plans, a citizen who has long been suffering from civic apathy, needs to appear before the mayor’s office at the KMC headquarters and register his/her name with the officer-in-charge of the grievance cell. Once the name is registered, the complainant will be handed over a slip where he/she needs to write down specific complaints, stating address, date and the nature of the complaint. Once this is done, the complainant will be sent to the head of the department concerned for a solution.The decision to introduce the step was taken following mayor’s direct interaction with a section of citizens over the last five months. “Some of the departments where we need to improve on include assessment, building, market, roads and drainage. We will encourage top-ranking officials of these departments and other essential departments like water supply to take note of citizens’ grievances and suggest remedial measures,” a KMC official said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73237261,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-567752,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-plans-spl-pass-to-lodge-civic-plaint/articleshow/73235313.cms

File photo used for representational purpose

NEW DELHI: Several sitting municipal councillors are likely to contest the assembly polls on a BJP ticket. Sources said the party has decided to field “as many” young candidates and might place its bet on councillors who have gained exposure in electoral politics over the past two years.

With the growing influence of Poorvanchalis in Delhi, BJP is likely to give them a larger representation this time. Sources said several constituencies, which have a large number of unauthorised colonies, might get Poorvanchali candidates. The ruling AAP has over a dozen MLAs with their roots in eastern UP and Bihar. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari is from Poorvanchal.

In the 2017 municipal polls, BJP had fielded new candidates on all 272 wards. The effort paid off as the party won 181 seats.

“The election committee has already held several rounds of meetings and the candidature of 50 councillors was discussed. About 30 sitting councillors may get the final nod to contest,” said a party functionary.

Six serving councillors had contested the 2013 assembly polls, of which three had won. In 2015, 18 sitting and former councillors had contested, but only one — Vijender Gupta from Rohini — had managed to win.

The committee will also have to decide on finalising the seat-sharing arrangement with Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), its old ally. While SAD (Badal) has sought four seats, sources said BJP might give it three. Another party functionary said the election committee has shortlisted one candidate on about 25 seats, while 2-3 potential names have been decided for 10-15 more seats. “The final list will be announced only after the central election committee takes a call. We hope to come out with the first list in a couple of days,” he added.

From the thousands of applications, about 1,400 have been shortlisted by the state committee. Sources said the list was further brought down to 450 and sent to the central committee.

The initial decision-makers include Union minister and Delhi election in-charge Prakash Javadekar, co-in-charges Hardeep Singh Puri and Nityanand Rai, general secretary (organisation) BL Santosh, Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel, Manoj Tiwari and Vijender Gupta.

Shopkeepers and kite manufacturers have attributed the decline to recession

AHMEDABAD: Except for the last-minute rush to the traditional kite markets in the Walled City of Ahmedabad, seasonal kite stores bore a deserted look ahead of the festival. Kite traders say sales have declined by a significant 20% against last year. Shopkeepers and kite manufacturers have attributed the decline to recession.

“The market is overstocked with kites and there’s little sales. Recession has hit the industry. We have few orders from corporate houses that usually spend big for kites branded with their company logo and names,” said Pappubhai Patangwala, a manufacturer based in Kalupur Tower area of the city.

Retailers say that the demand has picked up only in the last two-three days. “Normally, the rush is at its peak on January 13, i.e. a day before Uttarayan. However, this time the sudden change in weather has also deterred several people from buying kites. As there was unseasonal rain in several parts of Gujarat; and the weather went cloudy on Monday, many were unsure whether they will be able to fly kites. The footfalls were much lower than normal,” said Mahendra Soni, a trader in the Raipur kite market.

Even as the demand remained lukewarm, vendors and kitemakers have put their best foot forward to woo customers with catchy, contemporary and popular slogans and prints on kites. Prints ranging from pictures of political leaders and cartoons to those with social messages were seen in the market.

In addition to kites, threads and sunglasses, masks and visors were equally popular.

Madurai: The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), Madurai division has started a spiritual tour service for the convenience of visitors and tourists thronging the city. Visitors will be taken from Ellis Nagar parking lot to places like Thirupparankundram temple, King Thirumalai Nayak Mahal, Mariamman Teppakulam, Gandhi Museum and World Tamil Sangam and dropped back at the same place.

The service was started on Sunday for Pongal festival anticipating a large number of visitors and Ayyappa devotees. Officials said that apart from catering to the visitors, the initiative will help promote tourism in the city.

Officials from TNSTC said that they are operating 10 to 15 buses to Meenakshi temple on a regular basis, depending on the demand. Three of them have been allocated for the spiritual tour. Fare has been fixed at a nominal price of Rs 125 per person. The first trip will start at 8am and conclude at 1pm, whereas the second tour will start at 2pm and conclude at 7pm.

A higher official said visitors can stop the bus at their desired place if they want to have some snack during the tour. “We have introduced this service on a pilot basis and depending on the demand, it will be expanded further. Meenakshi Amman temple has been excluded from the tour since exclusive services connecting Ellis Nagar and the temple are already available,” he said.

About 2.09 domestic and 2.44 lakh foreign tourists visited Madurai in 2018. While most of them visit Meenakshi temple, only a fraction of them visit other tourist attractions in the city. The city tour facility will help promote such tourist destinations.

The tourism department had operated city tours some years ago, which was stopped due to various issues. Initially, the TNSTC and district tourism officials planned to start a joint tour, with the latter proposing to take permission from the Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) department to help visitors to have a speedy darshan. But, TNSTC has launched the service on its own. The buses can be booked on 9894996142 and 9994520520.

Madurai: Sixteen Class XII girls belonging to Madurai Corporation schools are undergoing free special coaching for Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) entrance exams for a year, which is sponsored by the civic body.

Alongside their regular classes, the students are being trained for these entrance exams in the two newly-constructed smart classrooms with air-conditioners at the Avvai Corporation Girls Higher Secondary School.

“It was suggested to handpick students who are really interested in pursuing medicine or engineering and bring them together to provide special training with facilities equal to that of a private coaching centre. This is the first time we are doing this at our school. We hope to have more students next year,” said Poongavanam, headmistress of Avvai school.

All expenses, including transport for the special coaching are being borne by the corporation. The students are trained by qualified teachers appointed by the corporation during weekends between 10am and 3pm.

“We are planning to intensify the classes in the following months, especially after board exams are over. Now, their focus is slightly more towards boards. We will soon be setting up computers with superfast internet connection for students to practice online mock tests,” said Balu Mani, assistant headmaster and co-ordinator for the special class.

The students said that they are highly hopeful of clearing the entrance exams and secure admission into good colleges. “We find chemistry to be the toughest subject. However, the new Class XII syllabus that was introduced this year is far more helpful for the entrance exams so we think it is easier this time,” they said.

Madurai: More than 1,000 bulls and an equal number of young men were passed fit to participate in Avaniapuram, Palamedu and Alanganallur jallikattu, where the preparatory works are in full swing for the much-awaited spectacle.

Though the Avaniapuram jallikattu is the first to be held on January 15, the registration for bull tamers was carried out on Monday after uncertainty loomed over the conduct of the game this time.

While men were checked for their weight, age, BMI index and health condition, the bulls were screened for age, height and health. Owners had to bring an application with the photograph of the animal, copies of their Aadhaar card, ration card and written application.

Bulls should be more than 120cm tall and aged between three to eight years. Only the native breeds with a hump would be allowed to participate and owners have to bring copies of necessary documents and a photograph of the bull to obtain the fitness certificate. A team of veterinarians led by assistant of animal husbandry Dr N R Saravanan screened the bulls at Avaniapuram.

In Alanganallur and Palamedu, a large number of women were seen queuing up for registration of bulls. Pandiammal R of Palamedu, who was in the queue, said she was submitting the documents on behalf of her son who would participate in the games. She took the bull also with her for registration. “It is women like us who usually take care of the bulls at home and it is easier for us to handle them when we go for certification process,” she said. Meanwhile, traditional “muhurthakal” was planted in Alanganallur as the first step of the jallikattu on Monday. Collector T G Vinay was present.

Representative image

BENGALURU: Two BBMP employees allegedly went around an east Bengaluru locality last week, dropping the name of the controversial National Register of Citizens, demanding property documents from residents belonging to minorities, and marking their names in the voters’ list they carried with them.

The duo triggered panic in HRBR Layout ’s Kacharakanahalli ward on January 9, prompting locals to picket them. While one of the two men took to his heels, the other one was taken to Banaswadi police station where he was later released.

“My mother and I were at home when two men came and said they were from BBMP. They marked a cross against our names in the voters’ list they had brought and walked into neighbouring streets,” said Halima Sadiya, a private sector employee.

A few hours later, the two men returned and asked Halima to show her property documents. By then a large number of residents had gathered at the spot as several of their names too were marked in the sheets.

On being questioned, they said they were tasked with identifying ineligible voters in the electoral rolls in view of the proposed National Register of Citizens.

Dissatisfied with the reply, the residents asked the officials to show their ID cards. The men identified themselves as election officer SR Ramesh and computer operator Harish.

“The duo visited at least 30-40 houses in the area, asking for property papers. As people began shooting videos, Harish ran away but Ramesh stayed back,” Halima added.

“As we checked his list, we found that he had marked a black cross only against names of voters from a certain community, a resident said. Ramesh later claimed he had come to check if the residents had paid their property tax, he added. “We asked him why he was carrying a voters’ list to check property tax details. But he did not have an answer to that,” he said.

Ramesh also made his superior officer speak to the agitated residents. A woman, identifying herself as Jaya, spoke to them over phone and asked them to comply with Ramesh’s request. The residents immediately took Ramesh to Banaswadi police station, where he was allowed to go after police verified his credentials.

BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar told TOI they had sent block-level supervisor SR Ramesh to HRBR Layout in connection with residents’ complaints about some civic issues but did not know why the officer went around asking for property documents. Kumar said he will send the jurisdictional revenue officer to the spot on Tuesday to speak to the residents.

SR Ramesh could not be reached for comments.

Madurai: The number of direct petitions received during the weekly grievance meetings conducted by the Madurai Corporation has come down by half as people prefer to raise their grievances through the new IVR complaint system introduced by the civic body a month ago, officials have said.

A team led by corporation commissioner S Visakan receives grievance petitions by taking part in the weekly grievance day meetings on Tuesdays. There are four zones in Madurai and the meeting is conducted once a week in each of them. While 60 to 80 petitions are submitted each week, it has come down to 30 to 40 in the last couple of weeks.

Meanwhile, the number of complaints received through IVR-based complaint system introduced a month ago has increased. A source from the complaint cell said that while they received 100 complaints a day on an average last month, it has increased to 120 calls a day. Between January 1 and January 10, the civic body has received 1,191 complaints, of which 511 were related to water supply and sewage. It was followed by street lights with 318 complaints and public health sanitation with 305 complaints.

A higher official from the corporation said the processing time given for complaints received through the new complaint system is just three days for street lights, sewage, water supply and other minor works. Works like laying roads and patch works will naturally take more time to follow the due process. But, one-week time is given for rectification of the complaint received during grievance meetings.

“People find it easy to raise complaints through the new system, where one can just dial the given number and record their grievance. Commissioner reviews the complaints raised and action taken time to time. The new system also makes officials concerned more accountable as a complaint once raised can be closed only when the complainant is satisfied and gives feedback,” the official added.

The distribution of pongal gift hampers began on January 9 and the ration shops saw large crowds.

Shopkeepers distributed tokens to help ease the crowds, but some of the beneficiaries said that they had to wait for nearly four hours to receive the hampers.

By Sunday, the crowds began to ease as people had received their gifts in large numbers in the first two days. “Last year, I went late and got only Rs 500. So this year, I stood in the queue on the first day to get the entire amount,” said S Maliga of Thirupalai.

There are a total of 8,50,015 rice card holders in Madurai district. As many as 8,30,021 of them had received the pongal gift hampers by 6pm on Monday. Only 19,994 of the beneficiaries are yet to receive the gifts. This would be completed by Wednesday, said the district administration sources.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Scientists at the ICMR- National Institute of Nutrition ( NIN ) have established the possible link between exposure to lead and Alzheimer’s disease. Lead is a common pollutant present in a number of commonly used materials like paints, cosmetics, batteries, glass and low-grade toys.

Experts said the current findings could be a way forward in understanding the intracellular mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease.

In Alzheimer’s disease, brain cells that process, store and help recollect the information degenerate and slowly die.

A team lead by ICMR- NIN’s senior scientist Dr Suresh Challa worked on the molecular mechanism involved in the development of lead induced Alzheimer's disease through in-vitro (outside a living organism) studies.

Dr Suresh Challa said that Alzheimer’s disease has a complex patho-physiology which involves initially; formation of beta amyloid plaques and tangles in the brain.

“Oxidative stress and inflammation are known to be involved in the progression of the disease, with loss of memory and neuronal cell death. In this scenario, our study investigated the basic molecular mechanism behind the involvement of lead in Alzheimer’s disease,” said Dr Challa.

The scientists also studied various biochemicals available in food which can slow down the progression of the disease. “Foods like green tea , guava leaves, apples, cherries, pears and black berries, which possess antioxidant , anti-inflammatory and metal chelant properties were studied. Their ability to effectively permeate brain and modify several cell survival signalling pathways shows they have preventive and therapeutic potential,” he added.

Moreover, the effects of environmental exposure to lead can also be passed onto a child from a pregnant mother.

“Maternal exposure to lead during pregnancy can cause developmental reprogramming which can lead to higher risk and early onset of Alzheimer’s disease in later life of the child,” said Dr R Hemalatha, director, ICMR-NIN, and added that the study is a step forward in understanding Alzheimer’s disease and developing preventing strategies for the elderly.

AHMEDABAD: Uttarayan is typically a festival that Amdavadis enjoy within the city. However, this year since the festival falls on Tuesday and Wednesday, many have taken leave on Monday and taken a five-day long weekend off, to enjoy a short getaway. According to tour operators, people have opted for domestic as well as international destinations and bookings are promising.

“Bookings to Dubai and Bangkok were a hit among travellers this time as there is a good five-day break available and many have flown on Friday night itself,” said Manish Sharma, secretary, Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI) – Gujarat chapter.

Several private companies have also given Monday as a compensatory off so that they can enjoy an extended weekend, having made employees work on Saturday.

Destinations such as Goa, and cities in Rajasthan are equally popular among tourists, said Anuj Pathak, secretary, Travel Agents and Tour Operators’ Association of Gujarat (TAG).

Many have also booked private transport vehicles to take a short break. “Destinations within Gujarat are quite popular among tourists, as people can enjoy Uttarayan while taking a break from the daily hustle. We have got a lot of big vehicles including 11- and 14-seater buses and vehicles for destinations such as Gir and Bhuj. Some have also chosen to go to Rajasthan too,” said Paresh Thaker, a city-based travel company owner.

HYDERABAD: More than 60 hours after touchdown, hundreds of Indians were still stranded in Dubai , on Monday, majority of them without luggage or clarity about their onward journey. Holed up in hotels – some over an hour or more away from the airport – they kept running from one Emirates counter to the other for information about their connections, but in vain.

These passengers flying to the US, the UK and Europe landed in the city on Saturday amid torrential rains that led to widespread disruption in air traffic in and out of the Dubai International Airport .

“I had to buy fresh clothes today (Monday), because I still don’t know how long I have to stay put here. I am on the waitlist for January 15 and am clueless about where my baggage is,” said Dishanki Nilesh Savla, who is headed to Orlando.

Sharing her ordeal with TOI, over telephone from Dubai, the student of Clinical Psychology at the University of Central Florida added: “Though the airline allotted a hotel, after 10 hours of standing in queue, the next day the staff abruptly called me asking me to check-out and go back to the airport at 1am. I had to fight with them to let me stay back because I still don’t have a ticket for the US.”

Dishanki landed in Dubai from Mumbai on January 11. She said her hotel is lodging scores of other Indians caught in a similar crisis.

“I have been accommodated on a flight for January 15 but that’s the earliest date of departure. Many of those waiting with me in queue on Saturday are booked for January 18 or later,” said Shyam Mehta a software engineer with Google in New York. When TOI spoke to him, Shyam was about to make his fourth trip to the Dubai airport, in search of his luggage. “Each time I go, the staff say they are clueless as thousands of bags have piled up at the counter. They take my baggage details and say they’ll revert. But that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.

Also stuck without luggage is Jyotshna M, from Hyderabad who is on a business trip to San Francisco. So bad was the hotel that she was taken to after waiting in line till midnight on January 11, that Jyotshna decided to return to the airport for the night and book herself a different hotel — on her own expense — the next morning.

While those like Ankit Kumar Gupta were lucky to reach their destination on time, despite the chaos, they are still struggling to track their bags. “It says still tracing bags. Really? I am here for 3 days only and shall I just keep waiting??? (sic)” he tweeted, on Monday.

Madurai: The Madurai city police have seized six fire arms – three revolvers, one pistol and two air guns- all unlicensed, from a civil contractor named Solai Gunasekaran, 59, on Sunday.

A gang of three including a woman looted valuables from Gunasekaran’s house in Appadurai Nagar last month at gunpoint. While a case was registered earlier this month, the Koodalpudur police had arrested the trio and seized the weapon used in the crime. During inquiry, the accused had confessed that the gun used by them was found in Gunasekaran’s house.

Following this, a police team conducted a search in Gunasekaran’s house and unearthed five more fire arms. A case was registered against Gunasekaran, under a couple of sections of the Arms Act on Sunday and he was arrested. He was produced before a judicial magistrate and remanded in judicial custody.

A source said that while six fire arms have been seized so far in this case an inquiry is underway to find out the reasons as to why so many firearms were stashed by him. Apart from the fire arms, more than 100 bullets have been seized. They are yet to find out whether he kept it for his personnel safety or involved in selling them. Inquiry was also pending to find out source of the fire arms. All the police officers remained non-committal in confirming the developments. TNN

Indore: As part of plans to improve condition of traffic on busy routes in city, Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has now designated on-street parking space for motorists and shopkeepers on Patnipura and Kanadia roads.

Lane marking has been done on roads from Patnipura to Bhamori and from Bengali Square to Patrakar Colony Tri-Circle to divide space for traffic, roadside vendors and parking. Civic body officials said that this arrangement has been made to ensure smooth vehicular movement in these areas as they witness heavy traffic pressure. “We have marked lanes with white lines to designate spaces, where parking is allowed and prohibited. This arrangement has been done to solve traffic congestion in these areas,” said IMC’s additional commissioner SK Chaitanya.

He said that apart from lane marking, they have also formed separate teams of IMC staff to conduct surprise checks in these areas and lift vehicles and pushcarts that are found parked on prohibited lanes. “Pushcarts are seized and sent to trenching ground. People whose vehicles are seized for parking on prohibited lanes will have to pay towing charge,” he added. Officials said that towing charge of Rs100 is collected from owner of two-wheeler and Rs200 is from four-wheeler owners. “So far, more than 50 vehicles and pushcarts have been seized from these two areas. The drive will continue,” they said. The civic body has also hired 13 towing vehicles including eight towing vans for four-wheelers, four towing vans for lifting of two-wheelers and a hydraulic van for towing heavy vehicles. Officials are also in process to identify similar areas, where roadside encroachment by motorists and pushcart vendors hamper vehicular movement.

Chandrasekhar Azad

NEW DELHI: Bhim Army chief Chandrasekhar Azad on Monday sought bail in a Delhi court claiming that the charge against him of being a part of an unlawful assembly is “erroneous”. Azad, currently in judicial custody, has claimed that police invoked “boilerplate” charges against him and arrested him “mechanically” without following the due process of law in connection with violence during anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protest in Daryaganj.

“Charging the accused with being a part of an unlawful assembly is erroneous, as at no point of time during the alleged incident did the police authorities declare, announce, or proclaim the peaceful protests to be an unlawful assembly, and nor were any warnings issued or announced in this regard,” the plea said. It alleged that “police invoked boilerplate charges against the accused without the same being founded on any allegation of fact, in order to avoid compliance with the mandatory provisions of Sections 41 and 41A of the CrPC and arrested the accused mechanically without following the due process of law which renders the initial and continued detention of the accused completely illegal.”

The court has put up the matter for further hearing on Tuesday. The bail plea has further argued that no specific incriminating role has been attributed to Azad in the FIR, whose contents were “vague” and based on “conjectures and surmises”. The plea further said that Azad was willing to fully cooperate with the investigation in the case and would not tamper with any evidence or influence any witnesses.

Azad, meanwhile, was taken to AIIMS on Monday for “follow-up consultation and treatment”. Azad is suffering from polycythemia, a condition in which the body makes too many red blood cells. “He has been brought for follow-up consultation and treatment. He is undergoing investigations and will be soon sent back,” a source said. A city court had earlier pulled up Tihar jail authorities for acting in a “callous manner” by flouting laws that safeguard a prisoner’s right and asked them to ensure that Azad was treated at AIIMS.

Iterating that RKM has always stayed away from politics, retired RBI officer Asoke Chattopadhyay said: ""Anyone who has read Swami Vivekananda 's writings knows he has always valued inclusivity. Vivekananda has always stressed that it is a person's work and action that define them, nothing else. RKM should have been kept above politics."" Kamalesh Dasgupta, who teaches in Jodhpur Park Boys' School, added: ""If the PM truly believes in the ethos RKM stands for, he could have never used that platform to say what he did on CAA.

Nagpur: The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has demanded an early roll out of the e-commerce policy and a regulatory authority for the business.

A CAIT press release said the current model adopted by companies like Amazon and Flipkart involves predatory pricing and deep discounting which has driven out traders from the market. It was because of this reason that the Competition Commission of India (CCI) ordered an investigation against Amazon and Flipkart.

“As a part of CAIT’s continuing agitation, a large protest was held at Janntar Mantar in New Delhi where hundreds of protesters had gathered carrying black flags and raising slogans like ‘Amazon ki Jagir Nahin- Ye Hindustan Hamara Hai,’ ‘Amazon follow FDI Policy or leave India’.

CAIT president BC Bhartia said, “After CCI ordered an inquiry into the business model of Amazon and Flipkart, its a fight for survival for traders of the country. The economy of this country has been run by traders since independence and we will continue with this practics in the future too. If any foreign company dreams of occupying the country's e-commerce or retail business through unethical methods, then they are highly mistaken.”

He said CAIT will urge for the inclusion of the conduct of brand manufacturers and banks under the purview of investigation ordered by CCI against Amazon and Flipkart.

AHMEDABAD: The traditional flavour of Uttarayan comes alive in the pols of the Walled City and year after year, the demand has only gone up to celebrate Uttarayan there. Terraces in the pols are in high demand this time among non-resident indians (NRIs) who have come to Ahmedabad for the festival and the rents have gone up significantly.

“There is a significantly high demand from tourists and NRIs and as a result, the rents have increased by an estimated 30%. Unlike last year, when the rents used to be between Rs 10,000 and Rs 12,000; for pol house terraces in Uttaraya, it has now gone up to Rs 15,000 in Khadia,” said Maitri Pasawala, a resident of Khadia.

Similar is the case in Raipur, where several terraces are up for rent. “We typically get a group of 10-15 people at our terrace every year. People enjoy food and snacks while flying kites and listening to music,” said Mukesh, a resident of Raipur.

Enjoying Uttarayan in the pols is a must for many. ""We regularly go to the Walled City and this time we will be in Patasa pol. One of my friends who is a local resident has managed to get a terrace of a private bank on rent. We have also hired a cook for the Uttarayan special menu, so that people can enjoy authentic delicacies, while the family can enjoy,” said Snehal Parikh, a Naranpura residence.

Pol homes reflect the flavour of Uttarayan and over the past few years, terraces have been in high demand.

INDORE: The ongoing field assessment survey by Centre’s team to verify claims of Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) for seven-star rating under Garbage Free Cities (GFC) component of Swachh Survekshan (SS) League 2020 have been extended for a few more days.

Survey had started last week and was expected to be completed by January 14.

Official sources said that survey work will continue for a few more days and the team will stay in Indore until the job is done.

“The team has to cover each and every wards of city and this process is time consuming. They have to collect pictures as well as feedback from citizens. It will take a few more days for the team to complete work,” they said.

The media attention is also seen as a reason behind delay in survey. The team members were spotted by media during field assessment work on various occasions and they have been instructed to be more cautious while going on the field.

The team members are keeping utmost secrecy and are not even seeking assistance from officials or employee while facing difficulty in finding locations.

This survey holds 1000 out of 6000 marks under SS League 2020. Corporation officials also expect visit by another team from Centre for physical verification of main survey. Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) director VK Jindal on Monday visited Indore to take stock of preparations for upcoming visit by members of parliamentary committee from Union ministry of housing and urban affairs on Tuesday. Jindal visited Aerodrome Road, Maharaja Pratim, Bapat Square and Malwa Mill, where he inspected public toilets, food outlets and spoke to people about measures taken by IMC.

481,['14/01/2020'],After movie horror: 15 stuck in Empress Mall lift for 30 mins ‘without help’,"This story is from January 14, 2020

Nagpur: Around 15 people, including women, children and two salespersons, reportedly remained stuck in a lift at Empress Mall for over 30 minutes late on Saturday evening allegedly without getting any help from the mall’s administration.

In a written complaint lodged with the municipal commissioner, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) fire officer and commissioner of police, the aggrieved people accused the mall administration of playing with their lives by neglecting maintenance and proper functioning of the lift.

The incident occurred around 10.30pm when the complainants took the lift after watching the 7.30pm show at PVR multiplex, which is on the third floor of the mall. The users pressed the ‘G’ button but the lift malfunctioned before getting locked and jumping to the fourth floor, the complainants stated. They finally got out of the lift after a traumatizing 30 minutes, that too in two batches.

The industries, energy and labour department (Nagpur section) assistant electrical (Lifts) Uday Dambhe told TOI that an inspection of the lift will be done on Tuesday and he will also check its maintenance contract.

“The mall has permanent licence to operate the lift. The lift has been installed by a reputed company. The error, if any, must have been logged in the lift system,” Dambhe said.

No helpline or phone is available in the lift, the complainant stated. When TOI visited the mall on Monday, the mandatory lift inspection certificate and licence too was not pasted in the lift.

The in-charge of mall operations blamed overloading by the complainants for the malfunction. Representatives of KSL Industries, which operates the mall, refused to comment saying that they will “reply only to the authorities”.

Besides the movie goers, two salesperson working in the mall were in the lift when the incident took place. One of the aggrieved women, who has written the letter, told TOI that the salespersons tried to call security and mall staff but nobody responded.

“The kids and women started feeling suffocated. We all started crying and fearing for our lives,” she said.

As per the complaint, when the lift reached the fourth floor, its glass door opened but the users couldn’t get out due to a wooden door which was locked.

The wooden door opens into the mall office and the lift is its only entry point. The door is locked from outside at 9pm by the staff after they enter the left while leaving the office.

“Four men in the lift forced opened the wooden door but the mall office had no other exit. We recollected ourselves and again went inside the lift. Fortunately, it worked and we came out badly traumatized. We didn’t know where to complain so we submitted a letter to the police and NMC,” the woman said.

Confirming that he has received the complaint, acting chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake said that they will inspect the mall building on Tuesday and take appropriate action.

Bareilly: A 17-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a youth and his friend in Fatehganj East area of Bareilly district. An FIR has been registered by cops against the accused.

The crime occurred on January 7 when the girl was on her way to work in a field. She was forcefully dragged by one Sunil and his unidentified friend. Sunil had allegedly crammed his mobile phone into the girl’s mouth. She was later sent for medical examination. Police have seized Sunil’s mobile phone and are now searching for the accused.

The girl’s father told police that his daughter had never seen the accused before and the only clue they have is Sunil’s mobile phone. The complaint also said that the survivor was thrashed for resisting the assault and Sunil crammed his mobile phone into her mouth to ensure that she didn’t shout for help.

The accused, on hearing footsteps of a few locals near the cane field, fled the scene leaving behind his mobile phone. The family initially remained quiet as they didn’t have any information about the accused, but when they received a phone call on the accused mobile, they decided to contact the police.

SHO Fatehganj East police station, Ashwini Kumar, told TOI on Monday, “We have registered an FIR under IPC section 376 (rape) and POCSO Act against both the accused. The second accused did not rape the girl but helped his friend in the crime. We have recorded the statements of the survivor and her parents. She was also sent for medical examination. She doesn’t know any of the accused and only heard the name of the person who raped her from his friend, who accidentally made a call on Sunil’s phone without realising that the phone was left with the girl.”

The SHO added, “We have now sought for call detail records (CDRs) from the service provider and have taken a suspect in our custody. The accused will be arrested soon.”

Nagpur: She is already fighting cancer and now faces another battle for receiving the coveted Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) from the Nagpur University (NU) during its 107th convocation on January 18. The NU has refused to award the degree to Arti Chaurasia because she failed to appear for the viva-voce before the deadline of January 1.

Chaurasia, who is working with the National Bank For Agriculture & Rural Development (NABARD), is suffering from cancer from last few years. She had completed her thesis on the subject ‘food and nutrition’ and appeared for the viva-voce examination on January 4.

As per NU, candidates who appeared for the viva-voce before January 1 are eligible for receiving the degree at the convocation to be held at Suresh Bhat Hall. Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde is the chief guest for the ceremony.

According to Chaurasia, she couldn’t appear earlier due to her ailment. After she came to know about the deadline, Chaurasia approached senior NU authorities through her lawyer brother, requesting them to consider hers as a special case.

Chaurasia told the NU officials that though she was under treatment and recuperating, nothing can be said about a deadly disease like cancer. She apprised them of the pain she was undergoing during treatment and stated that she would be relieved if her name as a PhD recipient was announced in front of a legal luminary like CJI Bobde and other dignitaries.

“It’s a dream of every student to receive the degree during convocation and she conveyed the same to NU authorities, but they refused,” Chaurasia’s brother told TOI.

Justifying NU decision, pro-vice chancellor Vinayak Deshpande told TOI that her case came up for discussion at the meeting of senior officials, including vice-chancellor SP Kane and Board of Examination and Evaluation (BoEE) director Prafulla Sabale.

“The exam director told us that over 25 applications of PhD students came after January 1 deadline for awarding the degree. If her application is allowed, all these 25 would have to be accommodated,” the pro-VC said.

NU bestows some prizes on PhD holders and a list was already prepared, he said and added that if these 25 are to be added, it would disrupt the list and authorities will have to make a fresh one at the last moment.

“We have decided to issue a provisional degree to Chaurasia just after the convocation so that her dream could be fulfilled. We have inquired with her about her health and it was found that her case is not serious,” said Deshpande.

NU exam section officials told TOI that the university was unnecessarily dragging its feet on the issue as the rules could have been relaxed for her considering it as a special case. The VC should have allowed her to take the degree, as it would have been a proud moment for the NU to bestow it on a cancer survivor. Other PhD students would have never objected but NU officials acted like robots, they said.

BAREILLY: A day after angry villagers allegedly killed a leopard at Jarifpur Gadhiya village in Budaun, the forest department has identified 21 people on the basis of videos and will lodge an FIR in the incident.

After the leopard had mauled two persons, including a teenager, on Sunday, angry villagers had beaten to death the big cat. An inquiry has been ordered against negligence of the forest staff.

This is the third such incident to be reported in a week in west UP. One leopard each was killed in Bijnor on January 6 and Moradabad on January 8.

Chief conservator of forests, Rohilkhand zone, Lalit Verma who visited the spot on Monday told TOI, “The villagers were injured around 4 pm on Sunday and if the forest team had reached the spot on time, the incident could have been averted. We are probing the negligence on part of forest staff. Besides, we have identified 21 persons who were involved in killing the leopard on the basis of a video. We will lodge an FIR against named and unidentified people.”

According to sources, the forest team reached the spot late on Sunday night and they alerted senior officials in Bareilly on Monday morning. No FIR had been lodged till the filing of this report.

Though initial reports said after beating the leopard with sticks, the villagers mowed it down with a tractor, Verma said, “The animal suffered a head injury and we don’t suspect that it was mowed down by a tractor. We have sent the carcass to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Bareilly for postmortem.”

Sources said on Sunday, a leopard attacked Sher Singh, 16, while he was playing and it attacked Mohan Lal, 60, on the outskirts of Jarifpur Gadhiya village. On hearing Lal’s cries, his son-in-law and other villagers rushed to the spot. They spotted the leopard and allegedly attacked it with sticks.

According to the purported video, which has been widely shared on social media, the villagers dragged the leopard carcass after killing it. They surrounded the carcass to click pictures. The mob later threw the carcass on the outskirts of the village. The forest department recovered it around 3 am on Monday.

As Budaun is a social forestry area, it is suspected that leopard reached here by moving along banks of the Ganga.

NEW DELHI: A day after AAP claimed that DDA had arbitrarily inflated the prices of flats offered for the economically weaker sections under a 2014 housing scheme, party MP Sanjay Singh and Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri were locked in a bitter confrontation.

Puri took to Twitter to rubbish the allegations: “Whenever it has nothing sensible to say, AAP always falls back upon a litany of lies, fake narratives and blatant misinformation. Fact remains. They neither have the will, nor capability to do any good for the people of Delhi (sic),” he wrote. “No matter how many times they repeat it, lies will remain lies. On their latest misinformation campaign on the flats in the EWS category... DLF constructed 772 houses, which have all been allotted. This means the people have found the pricing to be reasonable,” he added.

At a press conference, AAP’s Singh responded: “After I highlighted a scam in the construction and sale of flats for people under the EWS category, Puri commented, and the officials of DDA issued a statement from their Twitter handle, which turned out to be a big lie.” Singh claimed that Puri had said that he did not have any information about the 772 EWS-category flats. “It’s a lie. A legal notice by the allottees was sent to a number of people, including LG, PMO and Puri’s ministry,” Singh said.

Superintendent engineer of PHED Subhanshu Dixit said that the officials worked late night on Sunday to restore the supply. “The gasket of the pipeline broke down due to which the water was leaking. During our routine patrol in the area on Saturday, the leakage came into light and we immediately stopped supply and started repairing work. On Monday morning, only 30% of Jaipur received water but later the supply was regularised,” said Dixit.

According to PHED officials, more than 50 lakh litre had been lost due to the leakage. The sources in the department, however, said that said that more than 80 MLD water was wasted due to the leakage. Water has not been supplied to citizens since Saturday morning which was causing inconvenience to people. Meanwhile, private water tankers have increased their rates from Rs 250 to Rs 400 per tanker. Ashok Parnami , a resident of Raja Park, said that this sudden water cut helped the private water tanker owners.

“We used to buy tanker of Rs 200 but on Sunday price increased to Rs 350 per tanker. I understand that it was due to the leakage but during the time of routine maintenance PHED officials inform the public at the last moment. Tanker owners will increase the rate for that day. If the PHED officials will inform us two days in advance, then only we will be better prepared to deal with the crisis,” further said Parnami.

BAREILLY: In a move that is expected to serve a dual purpose — giving a facelift to prominent city localities and promoting cleanliness among residents — the Bareilly Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started painting graffiti with catchy slogans on boundary walls at public places.

According to BMC officials, the move is — part of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (or Clean India Mission) — aimed at making the city look beautiful and gain better ranking in the Swachh Survekshan (Cleanliness Survey) 2020, which is likely to begin the next month.

BMC officials have, meanwhile, identified public places such as parks, government offices, boundary walls running along city roads, flyovers and underpasses, among others, for paintings images with catchy slogans delivering messages on cleanliness.

Environment engineer Sanjeev Pradhan told TOI, “The initiative is aimed at making the city look beautiful as well as spreading cleanliness messages through pictures and slogans. The wall paintings will have famous cartoon characters wielding brooms and making their surrounding trash-free; paintings of trees and flowers, underlining the importance of plantation for greenery; wall paintings asking people to shun plastic and polythene for the protection of environment (plastic hataein, aao pariyawaran bachaein); awareness against the practice of open defecation; and dumping trash in dustbins, among others. At some places, walls have already been painted with images of Mahatma Gandhi and bearing messages ‘hum sabka ek hi naara, saaf suthra ho desh humara’, ‘swachhta hi sewa’, etc.”

Giving details, BMC artists said a team comprising eight persons was deputed across the city to paint streets and public places with messages and relevant pictures.

Maujahid Hussain, an artist employed with BMC, said, “Wall paintings have been done near Bareilly College in Kalibadi area and at pubic parks in Rampur Garden and Civil Lines areas. We are now painting walls of Shyamatganj flyover, and thereafter, we will move to Qutubkhana, City Station and Choupla road. It will take around a month to paint the identified locations.”

BMC officials said paintings would also help get rid of unauthorised posters and flexes, which are sore to the eyes.

Hussain added, “The identified locations are dotted with advertisements, posters and flexes. Once painted, people will think twice before sticking posters and putting flexes on the walls.”

INDORE: Overseas shipment of soyabean derivatives from local exporters has dropped significantly amid peak harvesting season owing to skeletal supplies hitting home business, said industry players. According to Container Corporation of India Ltd (CONCOR), export consignment of soyabean derivatives has fallen to nearly half in December as against a year ago in the same period.

A senior official from the container corporation, wishing not to be named said, “Export of soyabean derivatives has not been encouraging this season. We have not seen loads from regular exporters so far this season. Overall exports of soyabean derivatives look weak this year.”

Soyabean derivatives form about 50 per cent of total movement of goods from the region by the container corporation.

According to CONCOR, exports of soyabean derivatives from September to December stood at 3,000 containers as against 3,417 containers during the same period a year ago.

Usually, exports of soyabean derivatives from local exporters picks up with start of fresh harvest in October but this season loads have dropped significantly, said container corporation.

Madhya Pradesh is the leading producer of soyabean with over 60 per cent of the total output. This year, state is estimated to have produced around 40 lakh tonne soyabean as against 58.18 lakh tonne a year ago due to prolong rainfall.

Industry players said besides rail route, a lot of export consignment goes through road directly to the port but volumes have been less through road also due to limited supplies and high prices in international market.

Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA) has estimated country-wide export of soyabean meal in December at 60,000 tonne as against 4 lakh tonne a year ago.

The industry body has put total export of soyabean meal during October to December 2019 at around 2 lakh tonne as against 8.59 lakh tonne in corresponding period a year ago.
