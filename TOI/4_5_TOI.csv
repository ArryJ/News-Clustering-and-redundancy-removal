Sharmiela, who acknowledges that she is injured, finds it funny though that her accident “has gone viral” and clarifies that she was out only to buy medicines, for which she sought the help of a friend, who had a pass that allowed him to drive around during the lockdown. “I had severe stomach pain and requested my friends Lokesh and Dawn Thomas, who had a pass, to take me to a nearby hospital. We were enroute there when we met with an accident. Contrary to reports, I was not driving and was seated behind. My friend Dawn was at the wheel. I hurt my neck in the collision and blacked out immediately,” says the actress, who, after a day of observation and tests at a nearby hospital, spoke to us as she was being discharged.“I heard about the stories that are doing the rounds about the accident only now. Some suggest that I was returning from a party, among other things. There is no way I would be at a party, considering how much I have been stressing about the need for social distancing . Since the coronavirus pandemic broke out, I have been strictly at home. It is unfortunate that news of the accident was carried everywhere without checking the facts with me,"" she adds.As for her accident injury, Sharmiela says that she has been advised a month’s rest. “Thankully, I don’t need surgery, but I have a cast for my neck to heal,” she says.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74986636,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-90555/74986636.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/car-crash-sharmiela-mandre-says-she-was-out-for-medicines-not-to-party/articleshow/74986609.cms

3,['5/04/2020'],Govt fears waste of milk &amp; vegetables as enough local produce don't reach market,"NEW DELHI: The government is concerned over some reports of milk and vegetable going waste in certain parts of the country as local supplies are not being lifted. It’s also concerned about the shortage of labourers and less number of mandis operating across states.

Sources said these issues were flagged at a meeting of a high powered secretaries group on Saturday, which discussed the ways out to tide over such problems. They added that the Prime Minister’s Office has reportedly received certain reports of wastage of milk and vegetables.

TOI has learnt that the issue of at least 10 states where less than 30% of the mandis are operational also came up during the discussion.

Recently, office bearers of Asia’s largest vegetable mandi, Azadpur, had shared a video of truckloads of vegetables standing there and sharp drop in buyers.

“If mandis won’t operate, farmers produce won’t get access to market and so, either they will dump their produce or go for distress selling in their localities,” said an official.

Sources said the group of secretaries was told that not a single mandi is operating in Assam, Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya.

Though milk supply across states is more than 90%, distribution has been hit in Punjab, Maharashtra, Andhra and Bihar because of close down of packaging material manufacturing units.

On Thursday, the home ministry allowed manufacturing units for packaging material to operate during the lockdown period.

The group was also informed that it’s taking more than 24 hours to unload the railway wagons that are carrying essential items to states including , West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh due to shortage of labourers.

TOI has learnt that some of the ministers would interact with Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon through video conference to share their assessment of the situation.

5,['5/04/2020'],"#LifeInTheLockdown: Now that I’m home, my baby has started recognising me: Kapil Sharma","At a time when the country is practising social distancing to keep COVID-19 at bay, celebrities are making the most of their free time by pursuing their hobbies and spending quality time with their family. A case in point is ace comedian Kapil Sharma , who is enjoying every minute of this stay-at-home phase with his three-month-old daughter, Anayra . He shares, “Aaj kal saara din baby ke saath khelta rehta hoon, and khaata aur sota hoon, bas. Badi mushkil se routine sahi hui thi. Usko settle aur hamein time par sote hue 10 din hi hue the ki phir se routine change ho gaya. Abhi baby bhi bore ho gayi hai dekh dekh ke mujhe saara din. Usko lagta hai, ‘Mera baap kuchh karta hi nahi hai’ (laughs!).”Kapil has mostly been at home ever since his bundle of joy arrived. “In a way, I have been in a lockdown state since December 10, the day Anayra was born. I would step out only for two days a week to shoot for the show,” he says.The comedian, who has barely spoken to the media about his daughter so far, tells us that he can’t keep his eyes off his baby. He says, “I don’t even realise when the day goes by. Abhi uska mere saath thoda zyada attachment ho gaya hai. Pehle Ginni (wife) ko hi dekh kar hasti thi. Since the past few days, she has started recognising me and even smiles. That feeling is out of the world. She totally justifies her name — Anayra, which means happiness. She smiles like my mother and me. Hum teeno ki aankhein band ho jaati hain haste time. Khoobsurat apni mummy jaisi hai woh, and thank God for that (laughs!).”This phase has also led to a lot of introspection and realisation. Kapil shares, “We take a lot of things for granted. The lockdown has made us realise the value of people who work for us relentlessly. I have also realised that my mother has started behaving like a child, now that she has crossed a certain age. Jaise gajak (sweet) aayi thi Punjab se toh mummy ne bahut sari gajak dabbe mein daal kar apne room mein rakh lee. When I asked for it, I was told that it’s not in the kitchen and that I needed to ask my mother.”He adds, “It’s been 14 years since I moved to Mumbai, but it’s for the first time maine koyal ki awaaz suni aur sparrows dekhe; something that I would see in my hometown, Amritsar. It feels like nature is in detox mode. Having said that, I want normalcy back in our lives again. Sadkon par raunak rahe toh achha lagta hai.

6,['5/04/2020'],"Covid-19: Centre fights virus on the one hand, polarisation on the other","NEW DELHI: As it battles the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic , the government is also having to contend with growing communal polarisation in the wake of Tablighi Jamaat 's link to rise in positive cases.Senior government sources said that feedback from across the country suggested that the disproportionately large number of positive cases and callous disregard shown by Jamaat members to the well-being of care providers have embittered inter-faith ties, aggravating the challenge at a time when the government is fighting an unprecedented public health challenge.The concern led Prime Minister Narendra Modi to urge chief ministers to enlist the support of faith leaders. They should be told that their respective faiths would survive only if they unitedly defeated coronavirus, sources quoted the PM as telling the CMs.Sources said the conduct of TJ leaders, who disregarded the need to maintain social distancing at the Nizamuddin Markaz in the capital, as well as the way the Jamatis subsequently behaved with doctors and nurses in different hospitals has evoked revulsion among a large section of the populace.Feedback collated from hundreds of places across the country pointed to the damage caused by images of mobs assaulting doctors who went to screen suspected cases as part of contact tracing exercise — something that is crucial to stop community transmission — with individuals spitting at doctors, paramedics and cops as well as boasts that the ""faithful"" were endowed with ironclad immunity.On Friday, the telecom department told country representatives of Tik Tok, the popular video sharing platform, to take down objectionable material and put in place algorithms to screen out potentially inflammatory content. Sources said the conversation between the two sides was not pleasant with DoT representatives bluntly talking about the ""drastic powers"" that the government has at its disposal.The government is also in touch with representatives of WhatsApp and Facebook to stanch the surge of hostility, but feels it is facing a daunting task. ""It is time to unequivocally condemn what is indefensible and to involve all communities in the fight against the virus,"" said a senior government source.He expressed hope that Modi's ""light a-lamp"" campaign may help shift the conversation away from TJ on Sunday evening but more efforts were needed to ensure that governments were not burdened with a law and order challenge at this time.That the risk of communal tension is real was underscored during a meeting the chief minister of a state had convened to discuss the plans to fight coronavirus. Midway through the conversation, a doctor stunned the gathering by saying that the plans were unlikely to succeed as doctors were wary of approaching the Tablighis who had tested positive.""The problem is that the Islamic proselytisers don't realise that they have done anything wrong or that they need to submit themselves to the norms required for dealing with a full-blown public health emergency,"" the veteran doctor said.

7,['5/04/2020'],83% of Covid-19 patients in India are aged below 60 yrs,"NEW DELHI: Over 83% of Covid-19 patients in India are below the age of 60 years. The majority of people (41%) infected by Covid-19 in the country are in the age group of 21-40 years, according to health ministry data.While the elderly are said to be the most vulnerable to the disease, people above 60 years account for only 17% of total cases in the country till now. This implies others are also susceptible and the younger age group, particularly in the 21-40 bracket, may be more representative of foreign travellers seen to be the source of Covid-19 in India. They include professionals and students, who have returned to India, apart from other categories.However, the mortality rate , warn experts, is higher among the elderly. Reports of deaths so far indicate that age with accompanying conditions (co-morbidities) like diabetes , cardiac diseases and hypertension increase mortality.The health ministry did not provide data on age profiles of those who have succumbed to the disease.An age profile analysis of all the positive cases of Covid-19 cases in India so far shows 8.61% of positive cases are in between 0-20 years, 41.88% cases in the age group of 21-40, 32.82% in 41-60 and 16.69% in the people are above 60 years of age.Also, India reported 58 critical cases of Covid-19 and these were mainly found in Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. “It has been observed that most of the deaths are being reported from elderly people or people having co-morbidities such as diabetes, kidney and cardiac ailments . Hence, all people falling in the high risk category need to follow all precautions,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said.He said, “We are dealing with a highly infectious and communicable disease. We are battling with this on a day-to-day basis. Still, the case-doubling rate in India is less than other countries.”India has so far reported 2,902 positive cases of Covid-19. Of this, 601 have been reported in the last 24 hours, according to the health ministry data. Besides, the total deaths stood at 68, including 12 deaths in last 24 hours.According to World Health Organisation , around 9,72000 cases have been reported globally so far with an average 75,800 cases in one day.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74988397,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-551099,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/83-of-covid-19-patients-in-india-are-aged-below-60-yrs/articleshow/74988310.cms

10,['5/04/2020'],Why board games are making a comeback,"Ever since the lockdown began, leadership coach Aparna Jain and her family look forward to their evenings. They do their own thing all day, but at 6pm, Jain, her 78-year-old uncle Davinder Sood and aunt Peggy Sood get busy with Monopoly, Taboo or Scrabble.“We fight a lot about not accepting two-letter Scrabble words like ‘mo’ or ‘ab’? My uncle knows all of them and tries to play them, and my aunt always says, ‘if it’s a word, tell me what it means’,” says Jain.Board games are adding levity and fun to the lives of those stuck at home with their families for 21 days straight. These are also turning out to be a great way to get some pent-up energy (or resentment) out under the guise of friendly competition.Jain encourages her uncle and aunt to play charades or games that require them to act things out. “Aparna pushes our limits a little bit. One can get low being stuck in the house for so many days, so it’s nice to be doing activities and being silly. And we take pictures of ourselves doing it,” says Peggy Sood, who is an educator. Video game developer Asar Dhandala says board games have been keeping him sane. He lives with his cousins, and they get together every other day to play. “When the Janata Curfew happened, the entire family ended up playing the whole night, my parents, aunt and uncle included,” says the 25-year-old. If the entire family is playing, they opt for party games like Secret Hitler or Codenames. But if it’s just the cousins, they dig into a strategy game that lasts three to four hours.Leela Vinod Kumar is an avid board gamer who has been playing with his mom for half an hour every day and has been dabbling in solo games as well. “A lot of modern games come with an AI player where you can pick the difficulty level,” the software professional says. “There is a certain amount of fatigue that comes from looking at the screen. You could finish anything on your Netflix watch list but after a while of watching TV, you just feel dumb.”The lack of screen time when you’re playing a game of ludo or doing a jigsaw puzzle is certainly part of the appeal. “The major advantage is my parents are being cut off from fake WhatsApp forwards. Anything to keep them away from phones,” Dhandala says.Avid board gamers are in luck because their huge collections are having their moment to shine. Accessories exporter Prashant Maheshwari is the founder of board gaming convention Meeplecon, and has a collection of over 100 games. “I live in a joint family of 10 people, and one of the first things my brothers told me when the lockdown started was that they’re finally ready to learn all my new games,” the 35-year-old Mumbai resident says. While the family has been dabbling in all kinds of new, experimental games, they haven’t forgotten their nostalgia-inducing favourites such as Ludo, carrom and snakes and ladders — even carnival-inspired games where you win if you throw a ball into bottles.Vinita Sidhartha, who runs traditional board game company Kreeda Games, says the lockdown has given people time to do things they haven’t had time for. “In recent years, play has started to be considered frivolous, even with children. If a child plays chess at home and beats three people, s/he is sent off to a chess class because of the potential of being the next grandmaster. Now, many are going back to unstructured fun.”",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74987807,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-220509,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/why-board-games-are-making-a-comeback/articleshow/74987813.cms
11,['5/04/2020'],Coronavirus: ICMR gives nod for rapid antibody tests,"More on Covid-19

NEW DELHI: Expanding the testing strategy in line with its containment plans in high-risk areas and Covid-19 hotspots , Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) issued an advisory on Saturday to start rapid antibody-based blood test for coronavirus The strategy for using the test includes clusters (containment zone) and large migration gatherings or evacuees’ centres.“As a matter of abundant precaution, all symptomatic ILI ( influenza-like illness ) are to be monitored in health facilities. Any surge in cases to be monitored and brought to the notice of surveillance officer/CMO for additional investigation,” the advisory said.It added all ILI persons should be home- quarantined for 14 days. At facility level, all symptomatic people with influenza-like illness having cough, cold, low-grade fever and sore throat will be tested with rapid antibody tests.If a patient tests positive after a rapid antibody test, decision will be taken based on clinical assessment and treatment in hospital will follow. As per protocol, contact tracing will also be done.In case of negative results, RT-PCR may be done if warranted.The revision in the strategy came in view of the increasing number of cases in last few days needing an immediate check on migrant workers, who left cities for their homes, for Covid-19. The exodus, followed by the rise in numbers linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation, led to the government identifying hotspots and high-risk zones and devising its strategy accordingly.The decision was taken by the empowered group, one of 11 formed to consider various aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, that is looking at disease surveillance, testing and availability of hospitals and isolation beds.On Saturday, health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said over 75000 samples have been tested so far and the numbers are increasing gradually depending on the case load.The number of tests conducted per day has increased to more than 10,000 now, as compared to around 5000 a week ago, Agarwal said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74988430,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-373847,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-icmr-gives-nod-for-rapid-antibody-tests/articleshow/74988392.cms
12,['5/04/2020'],Covid-19 lockdown: Cash reaches 40% of 20 cr women beneficiaries,"NEW DELHI: The largest-ever cash transfer scheme launched on Friday to put Rs 30,000 crore in Jan Dhan accounts of women has validated the evangelical push for implementation of the Jan Dhan scheme which saw the government exhorting crores of people to open bank accounts.By Saturday, the accounts of around 40% of the 20-crore women beneficiaries had seen cash deposits of Rs 500 each. Similarly, around 8 crore beneficiaries of the Ujjwala scheme will get close to Rs 5,000 crore in their bank accounts to purchase cooking gas cylinders for three months.The swift transfer of money at a time of countrywide lockdown is being seen as the success of the Jan Dhan scheme launched by the Narendra Modi government in its first term. The transfer into the accounts, which have been seeded with Aadhaar, is likely to ensure the money reaches those for whom it is intended.“The prescription to fund the unfunded is proving to be an effective remedy, proving the efficacy of the architecture of schemes, including the weaponisation of Aadhaar as a welfare dispensing instrument, which was put in place five years ago,” said a senior source in the government.In addition, a payment of Rs 16,000 crore as the next installment of Kisan Samman stipend is expected to go directly into the account of 8.7 crore farmers. Another Rs 3,000 crore will be put into the accounts of senior citizens, widows and the differently-abled, categories which need succour in these challenging times.As the Covid-19 pandemic has swept through the world, threatening to lay waste both developed and developing economies, countries responded in two different ways to tackle the fallout.First was through fiscal and monetary measures, but the second was through income support programmes to the most vulnerable and small businesses. The latter, according to economists and policy experts, is the key to bridging the gap between a devastating economic downturn and hopefully an eventual recovery.Interestingly, when PM Narendra Modi held a video conference with Indian envoys around the globe, one of the things that emerged was a similarity between Indian and the US approaches on income support policies. This, even as Washington and New Delhi took very different paths in tackling the pandemic.On March 26, the Modi government announced a set of cash transfer and related benefits that would use the JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) backbone to implement largescale, technology-enabled and real-time direct benefit transfers. Having set this system up in the first term of the government, this would be an ideal time to use it.As Jahangir Aziz of JP Morgan Chase Bank wrote, “The government’s efforts over the last five years make India one of the best placed economies to deliver such cash transfers.”The government’s announcement will see 20 crore women Jan Dhan account holders get Rs 500 per month for the next three months; increase in MGNREGA wage to Rs 202 a day from Rs 182 to benefit 13.62 crore families; ex-gratia of Rs 1,000 to 3 crore poor senior citizens, poor widows and poor disabled. The government will also front-load Rs 2,000 paid to farmers in the first week of April under the existing PM Kisan Yojana to benefit 8.7 crore farmers, as well as extend insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh per health worker fighting Covid-19.On March 27, US President Donald Trump also announced a set of similar income support measures. Most adults will get $1,200. For every qualifying child aged 16 or under, the payment will be an additional $500.Single adults with social security numbers who have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 per year or less will get the full amount. Married couples with no children earning $150,000 or less will receive a total of $2,400.Since the US Internal Revenue Service already has taxpayers’ bank account information, it will transfer the money to them via direct deposit.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74988435,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-485071,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-lockdown-cash-reaches-40-of-20-cr-women-beneficiaries/articleshow/74988432.cms

14,['5/04/2020'],Many having nothing to do with Tablighi meet also quarantined,"A man rides his bullock cart during lockdown in Dahegaon on Saturday

Nagpur: Wasim Pathan (name changed) is a staunch Barelvi sect member and holds top position in its local body here. Pathan is 83-year-old and had recently suffered a heart attack. Despite his failing health and belonging to a sect ideologically opposed to Tablighi Jamaat (TJ), Pathan now finds himself in institutional qurantine at Ravi Bhavan.

Though Pathan had been to Delhi to pay obeisance to Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, a practice proscribed by the TJ, he has been allegedly bracketed in the same group since he is a Muslim.

Similarly, two more Muslim youths belonging to Ahle Sunnat Jamaat have been quarantined at Vanamati. A newly married Muslim man and his friends too have been quarantined while the bride is stuck in Delhi. Some couples who had gone for honeymoon to North India are also being quarantined.

Lack of understanding about these sects and their ideologies among government officials have led to their journeys to Delhi being attributed to TJ congregation.

“It is blasphemous to being linked to TJ, which propagates the concept of Da'wah (invitation) and proscribes sufism,” says a Barelvi sect member. The feud over conveying Allah’s message through Dargah culture or Tabligh is centuries old and have kept the sects at loggerheads.

Even the Tablighis are at the receiving end of government’s drive in isolating each Delhi returnee though the directorate of health department’s circular rules out quarantining most of these people. The circular categorically states people who are connected to Nizamuddin meet between March 8 and 10 must be traced and quarantined.

The officials apparent overkill is quickly filling up rooms at MLA hostels, Ravi Bhavan and Vanamati beside straining the testing labs at Mayo hospital and AIIMS. On Friday, 60 TJs were quarantined at these three facilities though they have been in city since February 28. “The local administration has to show they didn’t leave anyone,” said a source.

On Friday, the administration had asked Nagpur Markaz secretary Abdul Bari Patel to counsel Muslims at the quarantine centres. Bari himself was shocked when he met the Muslims who subscribe to different sects.

“I appeal to the administration and police to clearly mention in the form before each name exact details of each person. If a Muslim has visited Markaz it must be mentioned in the form so that exact number of people who went to that meet is found out,” he said.

Bari added, “What I understood from the counselling session at MLA and Vanamati that not all who returned from Delhi were at Markaz. I also found out that two had gone in individual capacity to Markaz”

Bari said the police, NMC and revenue officials were doing excellent job.

Nagpur: A full-grown male tiger, found ailing in Pench Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh, died during treatment on Saturday morning. With this, the tiger death toll in the country since January 1, has gone up to 18.

According to Pench field director Vikram Singh Parihar, the 10-year-old tiger (T-21) was suspected to be ailing for the last six days. On Friday, it was spotted by the staff near a water body.

The team of wildlife veterinarians led by Dr Akhilesh Mishra along with Parihar and others reached the spot and tried to push the tiger out but it could not move. “Even elephants failed to push the animal out,” Parihar said.

“The tiger was suffering from fever. The vets administered drugs with the help of dart even while T-21 was in water. Antipyretics like paracetamol and pain killers were also given,” said Parihar.

The staff continued to monitor the tiger near the water body on Friday. However, it died around 9 am on Saturday. All requisite samples and body parts have been collected for forensic tests.

Parihar said that it was a natural death.

Three days ago on April 1, six wild dogs were found dead in compartment 329 in Kothar under mysterious circumstances near Khawasa in the buffer zone of MP Pench.

Traders at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) yard at Kalamna are offering onions for Rs 10 a kg. Even the rates of potatoes touched Rs 15 a kg in the bulk market as against Rs 20 before the lockdown.

APMC Kalamna is among the handful markets open throughout the state during the lockdown. This has led to supplies from everywhere reaching the city. It has caused a glut bringing down the prices. As movement is restricted, even buyers are not turning up here.

Jaiprakash Wasani of Pankaj Traders said the buyers who would normally reach the Kalamna market are now getting their supplies directly from farms. With no takers, the traders are forced to clear their stock at throwaway prices.

Wasani has circulated a message that the common man can buy onion at Rs 10-11 a kg from his shop but will have to lift at least 45 kg.

Mohammed Afaque of M/s Afzal Trading said 100 trucks of onions reached Kalamna. The impact has not been seen in retail markets so far.

Ram Bagle, a trader at Gokulpeth market, said both onions and potatoes continue to be sold at Rs 30 a kg.

The vendors on handcarts would be charging slightly more, he said.

The group is trying to understand key priorities and establish an improved understanding of the community risk perception.The five-minute survey seeks personal details such as age, gender, occupation, area of residence (NMC zone) and recent history of viral fever. This is followed by queries on the source of information which could be social media, government, newspapers or TV. The most important part is regarding immediate priorities. Participants are given a range of options, including social interaction, travel and transportation, food, water, power, job, access to banking services and education.Sameer Deshkar, professor at VNIT’s architecture department, said the questionnaire assesses the vulnerability and preparedness of citizens. “Based on the survey, we will recommend to the government the status of people and their needs,” he said.The online survey started on March 24 when the nationwide lockdown was announced. “We have received around 320 responses so far. The trend of people’s priority is shifting from only health services to food and groceries,” he said.Data such as life support services, from where you are getting them, how reliable is it and the risk perception will be integrated with GIS mapping and shown in the final report to the government. As the Covid19 phase changes, the disaster priority of people, too, will change.“We are noting the emerging requirement of people in different zones.

21,['5/04/2020'],"Modi’s blackout call: Raut fears grid collapse, expert says no worries","Nagpur: What is going to happen on Sunday night when people switch off their lights at 9pm heeding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s blackout call? Contrasting views are coming out. While state energy minister Nitin Raut fears that the Indian grid will collapse, his predecessor Chandrashekhar Bawankule says that this was not possible. Power expert AP Ganguly says at the most only a few power generation units will trip.

Meanwhile, MSEDCL officials are preparing to handle the sudden drop in demand. They say 2,585MW hydroelectric generation is available in the state, which can be switched off immediately if required. They are hoping that the demand does not reduce beyond this during the blackout.

Raut has suggested a middle way to follow PM’s appeal and not endanger the grid. He has asked people to light candles without switching off electric lights.

In a video released to the media, Raut says, “The demand in the state has already reduced from 23,000MW to 13,000MW due to the lockdown. It is not possible to reduce generation further. So if everybody switches off lights it will cause the grid frequency to shoot up and the Indian grid will collapse. It will take 16 hours to restart generation units and a week before India limps back to normalcy.”

Ganguly says that this fear was without any basis. “The safe frequency zone for the grid is 48.5 Hz to 50.5 Hz. Ideally, the frequency should be 50 Hz. If the demand drops suddenly then the frequency will at the worst cross 50.5 Hz. This will cause relays connected to some power generation units to trip. As soon as some units stop generation, the supply will reduce and the grid frequency will come down. Thus the entire grid can’t collapse. Cascade tripping is only possible when demand is far higher than supply as it used to happen some years ago,” he told TOI.

Ganguly further said that electric lights do not have much load and hence there was practically no chance of any problem when people switch them off.

Bawankule has called Raut’s claim political and said that turning off hydroelectric generation will control the grid frequency. “When solar units stop generating after sunset there is no grid disturbance. The state government is reprehensibly indulging in fear mongering even though we are fully supporting it in the fight against coronavirus,” he said.

MSEB Workers’ Federation (MSEBWF), a communist power employees’ union, has appealed to people not to switch off their lights to prevent a grid collapse.

PowerGrid, central government’s power transmission company, has asked it officers to be alert on Sunday evening to take action if grid frequency shoots up threatening its stability.

A former MSEDCL officer trashed claims of grid collapse by pointing out that load suddenly went down in western countries during the Earth Hour but nothing untoward ever happened.

What followed was nothing short of celebrations, with chants of “Bhaag Corona Bhaag”, “Jai Shree Ram”, “Jo Bole So Nihaal” and “Hindustan Zindabad” ringing in the air.“The firecrackers didn’t stop after nine minutes. However, the streetlights were switched on at exactly 9.09pm,” said Prabhnoor Kaur Nanda, a resident of Tilak Nagar.In Janakpuri, people started turning off the lights from 8.30pm. For almost 20 minutes past 9pm, the area kept ringing with cracker sounds. Recalling the last request made by the PM, many came out in their balconies banging utensils. Divyansha Dhawan, a teenager living in B-Block, said she didn’t understand the concept of lighting diyas, but still did it.However, there were many who decided not to participate in the exercise. For Charu (35), an educator living in Mayur Vihar, this move was mere tokenism and a bid to distract people from asking tough questions.“Health workers are being harassed and doctors are dying due to lack of medical equipment. Questions regarding Covid-19 testing kits and arrangements for daily wage labourers remain unanswered by the government. We need to address these things as a community, not indulge in hollow acts like banging thaalis and lighting diyas,” she said.Pranesh of Govindpuri asked, “How can people have fun when there are hundreds dying across the world?”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lighter-side-candles-chants-crackers/articleshow/75000279.cms

The residential load is about 80% of this demand and about 10%-12% of residential load is lighting load in Delhi,” a power official told TOI, adding that on Sunday Delhi’s demand reduced from 1,968MW to 1,242MW, which was a reduction of 726MW.Earlier, there were apprehensions that this (the blackout) might cause instability in the grid and fluctuation in voltage may harm the electrical appliances. These apprehensions are misplaced, power officials had said.All adequate measures were, however, taken to maintain the grid stability.This was not the first time the city and the country went for a blackout. Such exercises have been conducted for ‘Earth Hour’ and similar initiatives. This year, the city had saved 79MW, including 42MW in BSES discom areas, during the Earth Hour on March 28.

NEW DELHI: A suspected Covid-19 patient allegedly tried to commit suicide by jumping off the third floor of the Lok Nayak Hospital late on Saturday night.

Sarafat Ali (37), who stays at Mata Sundri Road , was admitted to the hospital in central Delhi on March 31 after developing fever and headache. He has survived with a fractured leg and is being treated at the hospital. Police have registered a case against him under IPC 309 (attempt to commit suicide).

“On Saturday, Ali jumped off the building around 11:30pm and first landed on the tin roof before hitting the ground, fracturing his leg in the process. A doctor said he was stable and the result of his novel coronavirus infection test was still awaited,” said Sanjay Bhatia, DCP-central. Bhatia also made it clear that Ali was not related to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation case.

A fortnight ago, a person who had returned from Australia committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the Safdarjung Hospital. He was later tested negative.

Ali’s family members told police he was scared. He was admitted to the hospital after developing fever and headache but don’t have any foreign travel history, one of them said. Since Ali is admitted to the coronavirus ward, police will record his statement once he recovers and the test results are out.

Noting that the unusual circumstances arising due to the pandemic is generating stress, the mental health and substance use department at the World Health Organization has already developed a series of messages to support mental and psychosocial wellbeing of different target groups.

In the earlier case, too, the 23-year-old killed himself after he couldn’t go home in Punjab after reaching the IGI Airport from Sydney and was sent to the hospital after complaining of headache.

30,['5/04/2020'],No threat to grid from PM’s lights-out campaign: Power Minister,"NEW DELHI: There is no threat to the stability of India’s electricity grid from Sunday’s 9-minute public blackout and “light-a-diya” call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to show national solidarity in the fight against coronavirus pandemic , according to power minister R K Singh.“There is absolutely no threat. A robust protocol has been laid down to maintain grid frequency through the lights-out period. The national grid operator and national despatch centre will co-ordinate with regional and state load despatchers to ensure grid stability,” Singh told TOI on Saturday.He has been reviewing the steps with executives from national grid operator — POSOCO — and PowerGrid, the central utility that builds the grid, since Friday.Power engineers, too, stepped in by urging consumers to switch on fans for 15 minutes — from 8.55pm to 9.10pm — to make up for the lost load from lights.The government also issued a statement saying a robust system was in place and apprehensions over grid safety were unfounded.On March 24, TOI had first reported about national grid operator, POSOCO, putting in a special protocol to ensure grid stability after demand dropped as the lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic curbed economic activities.“India’s grid is technologically one of the best in the world and has the advantage of being a ‘one-nation-one-grid’ under a single controller. There are isolators and islanding mechanisms in the system. We have ‘flexibalised’ — giving flexibility to — thermal plants, at least NTPC has tried it, to operate at a lower threshold of 55%. We also can switch on hydel units quickly to meet any surge. Eleven renewable energy management centres and static precipitators are there to deal with the intermittency of renewables,” Singh said.Households account for 33% of the total demand. The lights-out is expected to remove up to 15 GW (giga watt) of demand, or less than 4%, of the country’s total installed capacity. Such loss of demand like on Earth Day is easily handled in normal circumstances, when industrial and agricultural load, making up 59% of consumption, remains intact. But in the current situation, when power demand has dropped 25% due to the lockdown, loss of domestic load needs additional measures, industry sources said.Officials said the discoms may begin to shed load in a staggered way an hour before the Zero Hour to help thermal plants reduce output. Some plants have been advised to taper operations to their lowest threshold so that they can be switched off, if the need arises. Hydel plants have been put on standby and will be cranked up once demand surges. The grid frequency will be kept on the lower side in the run-up to allow headroom once demand begins to fall.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74988517,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39689,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-threat-to-grid-from-pms-lights-out-campaign-power-minister/articleshow/74988520.cms

Another minister, Haji Hussain Ansari, is also said to be under the CM ’s scanner after his son’s name cropped up in the Intelligence Bureau’s (IB) list of those who attended the Tablighi Markaz in Delhi. Though Ansari and his son Tanveer both denied that anyone from their family went to Delhi, IB sleuths reported approached the family on the basis of Tanveer’s mobile GPS location.

“If a minister’s son is saying he never visited the Tablighi Markaz and IB has proof of his attendance there, then the matter can only be resolved through proper investigation,” Soren told media persons, adding, the minister in question and his family members have cooperated by accepting quarantine. While the minister is in home quarantine, his son has been taken to a government isolation centre.

Alam on the other hand denied that he had violated lockdown norms. “The labourers would have died out on the streets so some arrangement had to be made and when I arranged for the buses, the lockdown was not prohibiting internal movement for essential purposes,” he said, adding that officials orders can be verified and claiming that he was open to join any inquiry.

The increased availability of ventilators and other equipment will significant enhance medical facilities, particularly in smaller cities and towns where specialised services are less easily accessible.The government has cast its net wide for ventilators and has roped in public sector firms but now wants the private sector to use its resources to manufacture the items domestically to meet any additional demand in the event of the spread of the virus.“It was basically a message to ramp up manufacturing and less of imports,” said an industry source. The industry has promised to involve the auto sector to use its production line to manufacture ventilators and several companies such as Maruti, Mahindra , Tatas, Bharat Forge and others have committed to build a supply chain for such equipment, both for use domestically as well as for exports. The companies have promised to use 3D technology to meet the demand for such specialised equipment since some of the inputs of key components would require imports which my not be easy given the current turmoil.“The big companies have to be involved as it requires sustained and largescale manufacturing,” said another source.Industry leaders, largely from the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), also promised to encourage textile companies such as Gokuldas, Shahi Exports, Matrix, Arvind and others to ramp up manufacturing of gloves, PPEs and other equipment.

Q. If multiple animals were showing symptoms, why was only one tested?

Q. Will this finding prompt additional testing of animals?

Q. Should any animal showing signs of respiratory illness be tested?

Q. Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick from coronavirus (Covid-19)?

Q. What should I do if I think my animal has the virus?

Q. Could this affect tigers or other animals at other zoos across the United States?

After confirming that tiger in a zoo has tested positive for coronavirus , the United States Department of Agriculture ’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratories has issued an advisory that answers several doubts that would have cropped up in the minds of animal lovers and those who have pets.Anyone sick with Covid-19 should restrict contact with animals, out of an abundance of caution including pets, during their illness, just as they would with other people. Although there have not been reports of pets becoming sick with Covid-19 in the United States, it is still recommended that people sick with Covid-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus.If a sick person must care for a pet or be around animals, they should wash their hands before and after the interaction.Here’s a quick Dos and Don’ts issued by the USDA:A. This is the first case of its kind. We are still learning about this new coronavirus and how it spreads. This case suggests that a zoo employee spread the virus to the tiger. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by Covid-19. State animal and public health officials will continue to work closely with USDA and CDC to monitor this situation and will conduct additional testing if it is warranted.A. Only one tiger was tested as the collection of diagnostic samples in big cats requires general anaesthesia. Since all tigers and lions were exhibiting similar respiratory symptoms, the attending veterinarian felt it was in the best interest of the animals to limit the potential risks of general anaesthesia to one tiger for diagnostics. If animals can catch the virus, can they give it back to people? At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that any animals, including pets or livestock, can spread Covid-19 infection to people.A. No. This is an evolving situation, however, routine testing of zoo or personal animals is not recommended at this time. Public and animal health officials may decide to test certain animals that are showing signs of illness and that are known to have been exposed to the virus.A. USDA and CDC do not recommend routine testing of animals for this virus. Because the situation is ever evolving, public and animal health officials may decide to test certain animals out of an abundance of caution. The decision to test will be made collaboratively between local, state or federal public and animal health officials.A. You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with Covid-19, just like you would with other people. Although there have not been reports of pets becoming sick with Covid-19 in the United States, it is still recommended that people sick with Covid-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with Covid-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.A. Call your veterinary clinic with any questions about your animal’s health. In order to ensure the veterinary clinic is prepared for the household animal, the owner should call ahead and arrange the hospital or clinic visit. Make sure to tell your veterinarian if your animal was exposed a person sick with Covid-19, and if your animal is showing any signs of illness. Veterinarians who believe an animal should be tested will contact state animal health officials, who will work with public and animal health authorities to decide whether samples should be collected and tested.A. There is no evidence of this virus affecting animals at any other facilities in the United States. However, anyone sick with Covid-19 should restrict contact with animals, including pets, during their illness, just as they would with other people.

36,['5/04/2020'],"Delhi: Factories shut, Yamuna water sparkles","The 54-km stretch of Yamuna that flows through Delhi accounts for 76% of the total pollution in the river

NEW DELHI: What years of planning and huge allocations could not achieve has been ensured by a few days of lockdown. Stretches of the Yamuna that had become picture postcards for Delhi's pollution , showing the toxic foam - byproduct of industrial effluents - were sparkling blue on Saturday. The stench of a decaying river too had receded. The shutting down of industries has made all the difference. The relief is temporary but holds hope for the future if we can draw the right lessons.

The human assault on the river, though, has not stopped. Sewage through residential colonies that are not linked to sewage treatment plants continues to flow into it. Experts, however, say this is the ideal time to measure pollution levels in the river in order to let the agencies draw up a plan for acting against industrial pollutants in the future.

Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) says it will soon carry out a study to assess the change in water quality. ""We are in the planning phase and samples will be collected soon. We have already analysed the impact of the lockdown on air quality and something similar will be done for the Yamuna,"" said Prashant Gargava, member-secretary, CPCB.

The NGT-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee has also asked both CPCB and DPCC to carry out a study. ""This can provide a good baseline for agencies to act. The Hindon river is showing similar signs and we are now seeing these clean images of the Yamuna, which shows how harmful industrial pollutants are for the river,"" said Manoj Mishra, convener of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan.

Aquatic life in Yamuna may benefit in long run: Expert

Mishra, who has filed several petitions in NGT on the polluted water of the river, says this can help the aquatic life in the long run. ""A prolonged period like this can certainly help aquatic life thrive in the river. At present, though, there should not be much of an effect. We are already seeing an improvement in the terrestrial life on the Yamuna floodplains, including sighting of more birds along the stretch,"" said Mishra.

Although the river flows only for 54 km, from Palla to Badarpur, through Delhi, a 22-km stretch from Wazirabad to Okhla, which is less than 2% of the total length of the river - 1,370 km from Yamunotri to Allahabad - accounts for about 76% of the pollution in the river, a report submitted by YMC had stated last year.

Delhi alone has over 30,000 units in conforming areas while there is no official estimate for industries operating in non-conforming areas. Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. had last year fined 910 industries for directly releasing toxic effluents into drains, which eventually end up in the Yamuna. Industries are required to be linked to a common effluent treatment plant (CETP). There are 28 industrial clusters in Delhi, out of which 17 are connected to 13 CETPs. The remaining 11 clusters are not connected to any such plant, YMC had said in a December 2018 report.

A Delhi Jal Board report shows that out of 748 MGD of sewage generated in Delhi, only 490 MGD is being treated and over 250 MGD is going untreated into the Yamuna daily. While this can be solved by the Interceptor Sewage Project (ISP), it has already missed several deadlines, the last being December 2019.

39,['5/04/2020'],Virtual courts to hear urgent cases during lockdown,"NEW DELHI: The judiciary has taken a giant leap by deciding to open virtual courts across the country to hear urgent cases during the lockdown period and provide video-recording of proceedings to litigants and lawyers. It also resolved to institutionalise e-processes even after normalcy returns.

The Supreme Court ’s e-committee chairman Justice D Y Chandrachud held extensive deliberations with chief justices and judges heading e-committees of 23 high courts on Friday afternoon and resolved that “e-filing will be enabled in all courts, including trial courts , across the country for hearing urgent cases through video-conferencing”.

To dispel any doubt among litigants and lawyers about the efficacy of hearing of urgent matters through video-conferencing, it was decided that video-recording of proceedings in urgent matters will be hosted on websites of the courts concerned.

“Based on assessment of technical issues like availability of sufficient bandwidth and facilities of hosting proceedings on dedicated servers, it was felt that the recordings (of the proceedings) should be hosted on court websites by the next day. This will ensure that people have access to electronic records of court proceedings,” an SC official said.

The meeting decided to enable e-filing consistent with Section 6 of the Information Technology Act , which legalises all transactions by government authorities using electronic records and puts it at par with physical records.

The judges led by Justice Chandrachud were unanimous about providing free facilities for e-filing, scanning and uploading to lawyers and litigants during the lockdown period. “Hearing should be done by providing two cubicles or porta cabins, equipped with camera, desktops etc for video-conferencing. The HCs could use unspent money from phase-II of e-courts project for this purpose,” they decided.

Justice Chandrachud informed participants in the video-conference that “an e-filing system has been developed for trial courts by the SC’s e-committee in collaboration with NIC”. The CJs and judges of HC e-committees agreed that “such use of technology in judiciary, as is being employed during the lockdown period, must be institutionalised even after return of normalcy”.

The meeting also decided that “apart from virtual courts for e-challans under the Motor Vehicles Act, the high courts will consider use of virtual courts for summary cases”. Justice Chandrachud said, “Any difficulty faced may be brought to the notice of the e-committee, which will step in to enhance the software.”

Mumbai: The price of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and piped cooking gas will be reduced from Sunday morning. Following the reduction in price of domestically produced natural gas by Union government, Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL) on Saturday said it will reduce its CNG price by Rs2/kg and domestic piped natural gas (PNG) by Rs1/unit in and around Mumbai from Sunday.

Revised delivered prices, inclusive of taxes of CNG in and around Mumbai will be Rs47.95/kg, and for domestic PNG, it will be Rs29.60/unit (slab 1 of piped gas consumers) and Rs35.20/unit (slab 2) respectively.

After this revision, CNG offers a saving of 55% and 28%, compared to petrol and diesel respectively at current price levels in Mumbai, an official said. ""MGL's domestic PNG continues to deliver unmatched convenience, safety, reliability and environmental friendliness to consumers,"" the official added.

Public transport in Mumbai, including autos, taxis, BEST buses and some aggregator cabs, depend on CNG, and the drop will come as a relief for them. Officials said auto and taxi unions have been demanding a fare hike recently, citing an increase in fuel cost.

This is the second time in six months that CNG prices have fallen by Rs2. ""A fare hike can be averted for the time-being,"" an official said, although unions are still keen on a hike in future.

Many private car-owners have welcomed the drop. The dip in PNG rates will impact seven lakh households.

MUMBAI: Come Monday, the BMC will start using rapid blood tests to screen for coronavirus among 1,000 of its healthcare staff. The test will be voluntary as Indian Council for Medical Research has not yet come up with guidelines on the use of the rapid kits.

Given the rapid spread of the virus among healthcare workers in the city with more than 20 doctors, nurses and helpers testing positive over the past two weeks, the authorities said the screening test would help establish how many are vulnerable.

Rapid tests look for antibodies for the virus that develop as an immunological response in blood. The Covid-19 rapid tests will not diagnose if the person has the virus; nasal and throat swabs are needed to diagnose the virus. The BMC decision comes two days after the Centre and the state announced these tests would help screen for the virus. ""It is not mandatory, it is voluntary. Any doctor, nurse or helper can undergo the test if they feel the need,"" said additional municipal commissioner S Kakani. BMC has tied up with a pharma firm that will provide the tests at Rs 350 each.

MUMBAI: The civic body has said that the city's Covid-19 fatality rate stands at around 4%, which is less than the state average (5%). It was, however, more than the national average of 3%. Mumbai had reported 18 deaths until Friday, the day BMC gave out the information.

Speaking to TOI, BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi said testing was the key to win the battle against coronavirus. He said that the city has tested over 10,000 samples, which is even ahead of progressive states like Kerala. ""Mumbai has carried out 658 tests per million and the positivity rate is around 3%,"" he said. In comparison, Maharashtra has carried out 51 tests per million, while India had done 36 tests per million. ""It is through testing that we are able to detect and quarantine people early before they have full-blown symptoms and infect several others,"" Pardeshi said.

Will quarantine 5,000 high-risk contacts: BMC

Comparing to other countries, Pardeshi said the city’s positivity rate was much lower than nations like the US that have a positive rate of 17% or Italy, which has 21%.

He emphasised that the city’s weapon would be quarantining all the high-risk contacts. “We intend to quarantine 5,000 people in BMC facilities, unlike our previous strategy of home-quarantining them,” he said. When asked about the state being reportedly unhappy with the contract tracing numbers, Pardeshi denied it, saying that they have found more than 4 lakh contacts of Covid-19 positive patients.

Pardeshi stated that many hospitals, including small nursing homes that have been closed down due to various reasons, may be taken over by the BMC and converted into isolation facilities. He added that the BMC wouldn’t shy away from using force to keep people behind doors in their containment areas. He said there are various big challenges in the city, including congested population, close quarters and breach of supply line.

NEW DELHI: The geographical distribution of Covid-19 has a strikingly similar pattern with the H1N1 influenza in 2009, suggesting that though the spread in population could be high, it is unlikely to uniformly affect all parts of the country, the government said in its containment plan for large outbreaks.The plan, released on Saturday, detailed post-lockdown measures to deal with large outbreaks where efforts will be focused on active surveillance in identified geographical zones along with implementation of social distancing measures with strict perimeter control. Besides, intensified testing may be required among all suspect cases, high risk contacts and those with severe acute respiratory infection.“The current geographic distribution of Covid-19 mimics the distribution of H1N1 pandemic influenza… This calls for a differential approach to different regions of the country, while mounting strong containment efforts in hotspots,” the plan said.The government has drawn out the containment plan as clusters posing high risk of further spread of Covid-19 cases have emerged in several states like Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana, Delhi and the UT of Ladakh.As per the risk assessment made in the containment plan, 211 districts across the country have reported Covid-19 cases and the risk of further spread remains very high.The cluster containment strategy will be to contain the disease within a defined geographical area by early detection of cases, breaking the chain of transmission and preventing its spread to new areas.The document detailed a strategic approach for possible scenarios such as travel-related cases, local transmission, large outbreaks amenable to containment and widespread community transmission if and when India becomes endemic for Covid-19.The document said, ""Containment for large outbreaks through geographic quarantine strategy calls for near absolute interruption of movement of people to and from a relatively large defined area where there is a single large outbreak or multiple foci of local transmission.""In simple terms, it is a barrier erected around the focus of infection. Geographic quarantine shall be applicable to such areas reporting large outbreak and/or multiple clusters of Covid-19 spread over multiple blocks of one or more districts that are contiguous.""According to the document, the authorities will do extensive contact tracing and active search for cases in the containment zone, test all suspect cases and high risk contacts, isolate all suspect or confirmed cases, implement social distancing measures and intensive risk communication as part of the cluster containment strategy.For large outbreaks amenable to containment, the documents said the strategy will remain the same but vary in extent depending upon spread and response to be mounted to contain it.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74990184,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-85945,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19s-spread-similar-to-h1n1s/articleshow/74988540.cms

54,['5/04/2020'],"Kill the lights to join PM Narendra Modi call, keep appliances on","Police stand around graffiti on coronavirus in front of Town Hall, Bengaluru, on Saturday

BENGALURU: Switch off the lights for nine minutes on Sunday night to join Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call of solidarity, but keep your home appliances and electrical equipment running. That was the state energy department’s advice to citizens on Saturday amid concerns that a sudden drop in power demand, even if brief, might unsettle the power grid .

In a video message to the nation earlier this week, Modi urged everyone to show support for personnel engaged in the Covid-19 battle by turning off lights for nine minutes starting 9pm on Sunday and lighting lamps. The act is also intended to serve as a collective morale booster in the times of lockdown .

“The per day power requirement in Karnataka is between 8,000MW and 13,000MW and the average load clocked during evenings is around 7,000MW. If everyone were to switch off lights at the same time, we expect the load to drop by around 800MW. The sudden drop might affect the grid, and it is in this backdrop that we suggest that other sources of power consumption, including streetlights, be kept on,” said a senior official in the energy department. “Do not switch off the mains on Sunday night; only switch off the lights while keeping electrical equipment, including refrigerators and air conditioners, running.”

The state gets 49 million units of power from hydel sources every day, 42 million units from thermal units, 65 million units from the central government, 65 million units from non-conventional sources and 24 million units from other sources. Nearly 60 per cent of power generated in the night is from thermal plants. To ensure that there are no disruptions in the grid during the nine-minute switch-off, the state government has advised the thermal plants to keep power production at 50 per cent as it will be timeconsuming to scale up production immediately if the demand increases, according to some officials.

They rejected reports about a possible grid collapse on Sunday night. “We will manage it in such a way that nothing goes wrong,” one official said.

Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh have either expressed apprehensions about the impact of the voluntary turn-off on the grid or issued a list of dos and don’ts. Karnataka has not sent out any official communication on the issue to electricity supply companies, or escoms.

BENGALURU: Two persons who went on a drive in a luxury sedan during the lockdown in the wee hours of Saturday were injured after it crashed into a pillar under the railway underbridge in Vasanthnagar. Police have identified one of the occupants as Sandalwood actor Sharmila Mandre.

While Mandre, 33, reportedly suffered a hairline fracture in the jaw and nose, the other occupant, Lokesh Vasant, 35, ended up fracturing his right hand.

In a press release, joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikante Gowda said the accident occurred around 2.30am. ""Assistant sub-inspector Indra Shetty received a message saying a Jaguar car had met with an accident near Vasanthnagar underbridge. On visiting the spot, Shetty found the vehicle wrecked. Later, he got to know that the injured had been shifted to Fortis Hospital on Cunningham Road. Shetty visited the hospital and received a memo in which the injured claimed they met with the accident near JP Nagar. With no one providing a proper account of the accident, we registered a case under IPC sections 279 (rash and negligent driving) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others),"" he said.

It's not clear who was driving the Jaguar, which according to police was travelling at not less than 80 kmph at the time of the crash. Staff at High Grounds traffic police station said: ""Vasant's right hand was fractured while Mandre sustained a hairline fracture in the jaw and nose. We are awaiting a report to know whether they were in an inebriated condition.""

Police suspect the car had three occupants and rash driving led to the accident. The identity of the third person is yet to be established.

CHENNAI: A 24-year-oldman who was released from Puzhal prison last week in view of the Covid-19 pandemic is back in judicial cusody after being arrested for stealing a bike at Thiruvanmiyur on Friday.

Police said R Gajendran, a Sri Lankan refugee who stayed briefly at a camp in Tiruvannamalai district, was among the 3,934 remand prisoners released from various jails. He offered horse rides to people on the Marina Beach and slept there.

Police said Gajendran started stealing parked bikes to meet his expenses. The Taramani police had arrested him for stealing bikes and a court sent him to Puzhal prison last month. However, he was released on March 26 as part of the measures taken by the prison authorities to reduce the risk of inmates getting Covid-19 infection.

Gajendran who did not have any money decided to steal again, said police. On Friday night, when he was stealing a two-wheeler from Thiruvanmiyur MRTS station parking lot a security guard saw him and raised an alarm. However, Gajendran managed to escape.

59,['5/04/2020'],"Don't switch off all appliances on Sunday, says TNEB","Senior officials of the two arms of TNEB have been told to be at the headquarters at 9pm on Sunday

CHENNAI: TNEB's two arms, Tangedco and Tantransco, are gearing up to thwart any disruption to power infrastructure as the state is headed for switching off lights for nine minutes on Sunday night to light dhias as per the call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday.

The discom has to ensure balancing of the grid as there could be sudden increase in voltage when lights are switched off and sudden drop in voltage when all lights are switched on again after the nine-minute gap. As many countries went into national lockdown, the International Energy Agency, on March 23, had forewarned about grid failure and blackouts on account of drop in power demand. Many countries have reported more than 15% drop in power demand on account of Covid-19 outbreak. If conventional thinking is that power outages happen only when demand overwhelms supply, some of the most high-profile blackouts in recent times took place during periods of low demand, IEA executive director Fatih Birol had cautioned.

Tangedco has made it clear that the discom would not resort to power cuts during the nine-minute period. It is up to the people to participate in the initiative proposed by the PM, said a senior TNEB official.

""As of now, bulk of the consumption is in the domestic sector. The peak demand is less than 11,000MW. Even before the lockdown, peak demand used to drop on Sundays. We expect drop in demand by 3,000MW when people switch off lights for nine minutes,"" a senior Tantransco official told TOI.

Senior officials of Tangedco and Tantransco, after a series of deliberations, have decided to keep thermal and hydro units on stand-by mode once demand drops. They would be restarted after the nine-minute break, said an official. Experts in TNEB have urged people to keep fans, refrigerators, ACs and other electrical equipment switched on during the nine-minute period to avoid any major voltage fluctuation. ""If the grid collapses, power supply to all hospitals treating critical patients would stop. We will have a tough time managing this. People's cooperation is vital,"" said a chief engineer.

Drawing a comparison with the Earth Hour, the official said, ""During Earth Hour, lights were switched off, but industries and commercial establishments, which account of a sizeable share of power consumption, were running. That saved the grid,"" said the official.

Meanwhile, senior officials of the two arms of TNEB have been told to be at the headquarters at 9pm on Sunday to ensure grid balance and carryout instructions from the State Load Despatch Centre (SLDC).

SECUNDERABAD: An unidentified offender drilled a hole into a wine shop in Gandhi Nagar and made off with 26,000 worth liquor bottles and 8,000 in cash.

Police are trying to identify the accused by checking the CCTV camera footage inside the shop. Senior Task Force officials said this was the first burglary committed in a wine shop after the lockdown was enforced.

The burglary took place in the early hours of April 1. ""The offender, suspected to be around 25 years, drilled the hole into the false ceiling of the wine shop and gained entry between 3 am and 4 am,"" said Gandhi Nagar SI Ajay Kumar. Even though the incident occurred on April 1, the shop owner noticed it only on Friday while checking the surveillance camera.

""We will soon identify the offender and nab him. No fingerprints were, however, found at the scene,"" added the SI. A case was registered under sections 457 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night to commit offence) and 380 ( theft in a dwelling house) of the IPC.

A week ago, a wine shop worker attempted to steal liquor bottles at Himayathnagar. The offender was allegedly packing the bottles when the manager walked in after the owner found suspicious movement in the shop after looking at the CCTV footages. According to cops, the offender was caught stealing the liquor bottles which he intended to sell to customers.

According to Radhakishan Rao, DCP, Task Force DC , Gandhi Nagar's theft was the first burglary incident in a wine shop in the city during the lockdown. ""After the lockdown, a few persons were caught selling liquor illegally at a higher rate. But, this was the first theft case,"" he said.

Following the theft, the Telangana Wine Dealers' Association has urged police to undertake patrolling near wine shops. ""Amid the lockdown, theft incidents are likely to go up in wine shops as there is a high demand for alcohol. We have requested all the three police commissionerates to carry out patrolling near the wine shops,"" D Venkateshwar Rao, president of the association, said. He said the thefts in wine shops had taken place before. ""But now, with the shops closed full time, the offenders are taking advantage. We are concerned about the stocks stored inside the shops,"" he added.

The DCP, however, said the Task Force staff cannot specifically do patrolling near wine shops. ""We are busy tracing Covid-19 patients, their contacts and implementing lockdown guidelines,"" he added.

SURAT: A sugar cooperative in Bharuch district has forayed into mass production of sanitizers at its captive distillery, in a bid to fill the shortage in the market and arrest sky rocketing prices of the product.

Shree Ganesh Khand Udhyog Sahkari Mandli Limited (Ganesh Sugar Mill), which has around 17,000 farmers as members, has started with production of about 5,000 litres of hand sanitizer daily by using its supply of extra neutral alcohol — a key raw material derived from sugar molasses — at its distillery in Bharuch.

While other brands are selling 100 ml bottles between Rs 135 and Rs 150, Ganesh Sugar Mill is selling its 100ml bottles for Rs 35.

Bulk of hand sanitiser — sold under the brand name of ‘Ganesh Care’ — is produced at the factory and supplied to local cosmetic companies for bottling. The final product is marketed and sold by the factory in entire Bharuch district.

The cooperative’s chairman Sandip Mangrola told TOI, “Our aim is to make the humble hand sanitizer available at nominal costs to even the poor people given the current shortage. Our brewing team at the distillery is making the sanitizer liquid as per the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. The liquid is supplied to the cosmetic companies for bottling work.”

‘Made 1 lakh bottles in four days’

Mangrola further said that production at their mill started four days ago. “We have manufactured about 1 lakh bottles of hand sanitizer till now. At present, we are selling through retailers in Bharuch district only and are looking for government’s support to expand our reach across the state.”

According to Mangrola, the sugar factory has written to the government to permit sale of the sanitizer at fair price shops across the state.

He also said that corporate companies could fund the activity under their corporate social responsibility (CRS) to ensure that sanitizers, a primary hygiene product, are made available free-of-cost to the poor.

“We have enough reserves of ethanol at our distillery and if need be we can produce more ethanol from the molasses. We want the government to help us in selling it across the state at nominal rates,”he added.

AHMEDABAD: Just days into the lockdown, a Maninagar-based business couple entered into a big fight over house work and finances which resulted in wife smashing husband's laptop on the floor. The angry husband reciprocated with a resounding thappad which sent the SOS 181 women's helpline phone ringing.

""The couple is partners in life and business. Days into the lockdown, they were worried about the money getting blocked. Discussion over finances took a personal turn and wife ended up throwing her husband's laptop on the ground. He got angry and slapped her,"" said a 181 counsellor. The helpline team counselled the couple and matter cooled off only when the husband profusely apologized for the physical assault.

With people virtually locked inside their homes ever since the national lockdown was imposed on March 25 to arrest spread of Coronavirus, even as outdoors have fallen silent, the four walls of domestic dwellings are reverberating with domestic arguments and squabbles.

Infact, the 181 Abhayam Women's Helpline run by the state government is virtually ringing off its hook with more than theefold rise in the domestic fued complaints.

""Earlier, we would get 10-odd calls daily of domestic discord which has risen to 35-40 per day. Majority cases of husband, wife getting in each other's hair due to lockdown and people forced indoors picking faults and arguments with relatives and neighbours leading to feuds,"" said Ahmedabad coordinator of 181 Abhayam Falguni Patel.

Ghatlodiya-based couple entered into a major fight recently when the husband, dealing in plastic goods, who was rarely home due to demands of business suddenly was home due to lockdown. ""The wife complained that with no work, the husband started picking faults with the wife saying she did not cook well, did not clean the house properly and even did not look after the children well,"" a counselor said.

Not a good time to fight: Experts

Tired of repeated pickings, the wife asked the husband to mind his own business and leave house management to him. ""The husband got angry and slapped the wife who dialled 181 seeking help,"" the counselor said. The couple was also counselled that Corona times was not a good time to fight over petty issues but time to be together and safe as a family!

In another case, a woman with a four-month old infant was thrashed when she asked her mother-in-law to help her with household chores as she was overwhelmed managing the house along with a child and sans any domestic help during lock-down. The mother-in-law in turn complained to the husband who thrashed the wife prompting her to call 181 for help.

A 16-year old girl who had eloped with her boyfriend four months back resulting in police complaint was sent to her paternal aunt's house in Sarkhej during the lockdown.

Dr Hansal Bhachech, a city-based psychiatrist, said, “For first few days, people made most of the forced sabbatical from work but soon boredom set in. In one of the instances, a woman even tried to harm self after a domestic feud as now people have more time to mentally ponder over even trivial issues,” he said.

The card holders were under the belief that 1,500 would be given only if they take the 12-kg rice offered by the government during the lockdown. Though the government had made it clear that 1,500 would be directly deposited into the bank accounts of the card holders, the control room numbers of the civil supplies department are ringing with thousands of callers asking whether taking rice is mandatory to get the cash and whether the cards on which rice has not been taken for a year are active or should be re-activated by availing the 12-kg rice offer.

Senior officials said the exercise to deposit 1,500 into the bank accounts of the card holders would commence soon.

Further, enquiries have revealed that there are lakhs of card holders who do not take subsidy rice given by the government through public distribution system (PDS) every month. A substantial number of these card holders are above poverty line specifications prescribed by the government to be eligible for a white ration card. However, they managed to get the white ration card through various means.

Sources said they had obtained the white ration card mainly to avail Aarogyasri health scheme to get free medical treatment in corporate hospitals and also to get other benefits. Though the government had started weeding out bogus white ration cards, the exercise was stopped mid-way. Senior officials said the moment news spread that the government was deactivating the ration cards on which the subsidy rice is not being taken, the card holders started taking rice or coming to an understanding with the FPS dealer to keep their quota of rice after giving their thumb impressions on the biometric machine.

The government saved a lot of money after crying halt to the deactivation process, officials said. Now, all the card holders see this as an opportunity to become active card holders by availing the 12-kg rice as well as the cash offer.

NEW DELHI: The quarantine is intended to save lives but for women locked up at home with an abusive partner, the consequences can be alarming. Across the world from Spain to Brazil , calls to hotlines and desperate texts seeking help have shot up. Back home, the National Commission for Women says that between March 23 and April 1, as many as 257 women have reached out to for help.

Of these, 13 women have registered complaints of rape and attempt to rape, 69 women sought protection from domestic violence and 77 others had various complaints such as dowry and online harassment. Maximum complaints were from UP (90), followed by Delhi (37), Bihar and Odisha (18 each).

NCW chief Rekha Sharma said that the worrying thing is that women are scared to complain during a lockdown. ""They do not want to go to the police as they fear that if the husband is taken away, the in-laws will abuse them as they are living in the same house. There is no option of moving out and going to the parents' house,"" Sharma pointed out.

The NCW chief cited the example of a woman from Nainital who had sought assistance to be moved out of her abusive husband's house to a hostel till the lockdown ends. ""This woman's husband was beating and abusing her but she was not willing to go to the police as she feared what if the police released him and he returned home, he would beat her again. Her parents live in Delhi and she cannot reach them in these circumstances.""

To help more women get help, WEFT (Women Entrepreneurs For Transformation) Foundation, a non-profit, has launched a new initiative called 'red dot' under which domestic violence victims can put a red dot on their palms to alert people. ""Citizens who see the red dot on the palm can either get in touch with WEFT through social media or email weinfo@gmail.com or call 181 which is a toll free number to get support,"" WEFT founder Iti Rawat told agencies.

The initiative launched three days ago has received over 20 complaints of domestic violence from across the country, said Rawat. Sharma shared that the Commission has taken action to help the complainants in 237 of the 257 complaints registered. All these are online complaints and currently the only point of access during the lockdown, as the Commission's public interface at its headquarters has stopped.

RAJKOT: Had it not been for the helpline number run by ex-servicemen, Pramodbhai Trivedi's wife, a diabetes patient, would have to go with out her life saving medicines during the lockdown. However, the retired teacher who lives in Digvijay plot area of Jamnagar called up on the number seeking help for his wife, who had gone to stay with their son in Vadodara, to help her with the necessary medicine. True to their words, the medicine was delivered at her doorstep in Vadodara and that's not all - it was given free of cost!

""I am grateful to them for providing my wife with her medicine free of charge. This is a very noble and appreciable work done for the senior citizens in these critical times. I cannot express my gratitude as it was a request not for Jamnagar, but Vadodara and they provided it at her doorstep within eight hours of my request,"" said Pramodbhai, his voice breaking with emotion.

This is not the only example of beneficiaries of the voluntarily service by ex servicemen which started from March 30. These retired servicemen from the three forces - Army, Airforce and Navy - have joined hands to help senior citizens living alone. The service was launched in Jamnagar, but has now expanded to seven districts of Saurashtra.

The group approached Jamnagar district collector Ravi Shankar expressing their willingness to serve the the country in such times of crisis, especially to those people who cannot help themselves.

Coordinator of the group, retired Nay commander Sandip Jaishwal said: ""We have created a team of volunteers of ex-servicemen who are not engaged elsewhere and are free during this lockdown period. Whenever we get a phone call asking for help, we assign the job to the nearest person, who provides medicine and essential commodities to the senior citizen seeking help.""

""This is the second chance to serve our nation after retirement,"" said Jaishwal, with pride ringing in his voice, while talking to TOI.

He said that the team of 200 volunteers now serve people in seven districts of Saurashtra and in Jamnagar they have served 31 people in the last few days. They have extended their service to Devbhumi Dwarka, Porbandar, Junagadh and Gir Somnath districts in past five days.

A resident of Patel colony area in Jamnagar, Vijay Khakharia said that medicines are his lifeline. ""When I had no choice I called on the number given in the local newspaper. A person approached me, took my prescription and delivered me medicine.""

chief’s article focuses on importance of hand sanitisation

CHANDIGARH: As the world battles against the spread of Covid-19 by taking extraordinary measures and doctors and scientists research drugs for its treatment and and vaccines to prevent it, Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda 's controversial preacher Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh claims to ""have heard the knock of this deadly disease eight years back in 2012.""This claim has been made by the dera in an article, titled ""How to Safeguard Yourself against the Virus that Shook the World - Corona,"" which has been uploaded on the dera's official web portal.The Dera chief is presently lodged in Sunaria jail in Haryana's Rohtak district after his conviction in rape and murder cases. The special CBI court in Panchkula had on August 25, 2017 convicted him for rape of two sadhvis (female disciples) and sentenced him to 20-year imprisonment.On January 17, 2019, the CBI court had sentenced him to life imprisonment for the 2002 murder of Sirsa-based journalist Ram Chander Chhatarpati. He is also facing trial in two more cases - one involving castration of almost 400 Dera followers in Sirsa and second involving murder case of former Dera manager Ranjit Singh.The dera, which used to be one of the most influential groups in Haryana, is now run by a committee. The dera’s web portal also has facility of live satsang and is maintained by the committee, which has also been updating dera’s activities on it from time to time.The dera article also claims that its chief has been warning of these fatalities for decades.The article, uploaded by the dera management on March 14, emphasises on the importance of hand sanitization and regular washing of hands, terming it the basic and the most effective way to staying clear of the virus. “Incidentally, Guru Ji (the dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim) has even established a world record for most people sanitizing their hands in the year 2012... All we can see is Guru Ji may have heard the knock of this disease right then, to instil this habit in his disciples.”To prove their point, the dera has also shared a link of an article in which it has been stated that a record of the most people sanitising their hands simultaneously is 7,675 at an event organised by Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan and Shah Satnam Ji Green S Welfare Force Wing (both India) at SMG Sports Complex in Dera Sacha Sauda Sirsa, Haryana, India, in September 2012.Suggesting that people should follow some time-tested tips from ‘Dr MSG (messenger of God as the dera chief is referred to by his disciples)’ to stay away from the killer coronavirus, the article says, “Guru Ji Saint Dr Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan has been warning of these fatalities for decades… Apparently the cause of this havoc is the practice of eating wild animals like bats and snakes. As this virus emerged in China, and the Chinese are known to eating all sorts of insects and animals, this was a much-predicted scenario. This also means that the world really needs to choose what it takes on its plate with a lot of caution.”The article also advocates following traditional way of greeting: “Our wise rishis could sense the dangers in the womb of earth thousands of years ago and therefore they have created this timeless lifestyle called Hinduism. Guru Ji is often seen quoting this above sentence in his satsangs too, but it’s only in times like these, can one really connect all the dots”.The dera also suggests people should drink cow milk to tackle Covid-19 and also reminded them “how Guru Ji has also promoted cow milk to be used as a party drink and even established a world record for the biggest cow milk party.”",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74988805,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-194282,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/sirsa-dera-claims-its-chief-had-known-about-covid-19-outbreak-8-years-back/articleshow/74988765.cms

KOLKATA: Four Covid-19 patients were cured and sent home from ID Hospital on Saturday, taking the total count of discharged patients to seven.

Three of the five Tehatta family members tested negative for novel coronavirus in the second round, but doctors have deferred their release as two among them are mothers of two kids who are yet to test negative. With these three, the total number of cured patients in Bengal stands at 10.

Aong the discharged four was a 76-year-old woman, who conquered the virus in spite of being the most vulnerable owing to lower immunity and co-morbid conditions, such as COPD and hypertension. She is also on immunosuppressant drugs. ""But she did not require any intensive care. We are happy that we could manage her symptoms well,"" said a doctor at ID Hospital. The Egra resident, along with a 56-year-old relative, tested positive for Covid-19 on March 28, two days after another 66-year old family member-who was a resident of Nayabad in Kolkata-was found infected. All had attended a wedding in Egra. While the 56-year-old is yet to recover, the 66-year-old died a few days ago.

While asking people not to panic, some of them that STOI spoke to said that their only issue was the poor communication with doctors in the isolation wards.“Maybe because the patient load is so high, doctors take a long time to respond at times,” said a patient who landed in the city from London last month and was being treated at Gandhi Hospital.

But later the doctor came and explained that it was just a mild panic attack...Though I was offended initially, I realised the situation when I was told that the doctor was busy attending to a critical patient.”Another patient discharged from Chest Hospital said that it took more than 36 hours for doctors to inform that she had tested positive for coronavirus . “By then a medical bulletin was already released. The description of one patient there matched my case, but there was no official confirmation. Even today, police was informed about my discharge even before I got an intimation,” the patient said suggesting that a nurse or compounder be assigned to isolation wards so that some weight is taken off the doctors and patients’ problems too are heard promptly.“There is no need to worry to be anxious. I am proof that people can recover with medication,” said another patient adding that most of those discharged were given fever, antiviral, anti-allergic medication. They did not need ventilators or intravenous therapy.While acknowledging that all medical information is not revealed to a patient or their attenders, P Sravan Kumar, superintendent of Gandhi Hospital, said: “We are not supposed to share any information with the patient.

CHANDIGARH: A liquor vend owner in Sector 22 has filed a complaint with the police that his name and pictures of his vend had been posted on social media for home delivery of booze.

Gulshan Kumar, the complainant, said his friends had told him that some miscreants had put up his shop's pictures on Facebook and other websites a few days back. When he checked, he found that a message stating that people could call for home delivery of liquor had been posted with a mobile number.

Kumar approached the operation cell of the Chandigarh Police. When cops dialled the number, a man answered. The cop demanded two liquor bottles. The fraudster told him to make payment through UPI before delivery. The cop tried to persuade him for cash on delivery but the fraudster did not relent. The cop then revealed his identity, leading to the fraudster disconnecting the phone. His mobile was later found switched off, Kumar said.

Later, Kumar received a call from the excise and taxation department after its officials noticed the message. They advised Kumar to file an official complaint. Kumar said he then lodged a complaint against unknown person at the SSP public window. The matter was forwarded to cyber cell for further investigation. No arrests have been made so far.

Kumar said the accused later switched on his mobile number and added one more mobile number with the picture of his liquor vend. The cyber cell found that one SIM card was registered in the name of Mahavir Singh, a resident of Etawah in Uttar Pradesh.

This is a tough situation, and I will request the experts to give us suggestions on how we can solve such issues,” the CM said.The live ses- sion, conducted by the government, was to assist parents and students currently at home due to the lockdown.Sisodia said that there are around 44 lakh students in Delhi’s schools. “As a result of the lockdown, children are at home. It is very important to understand how to sail through these tough times. The aim is to effectively utilise our time during the isolation, and that is why we are holding this discussion.”When a student asked why they can’t go out and play, the CM asked parents to explain to their children that this virus is contagious and spreads through direct contact.Throughout the live feed, both Sisodia and Kejriwal insisted that the lockdown was an opportunity for students and parents. “It’s a crisis that we should convert into an opportunity. We have such a fast-paced life and people never sit and talk to each other. This is the first time that parents and children are at home and can spend quality time together,” said Kejriwal.On the students missing out on their happiness classes, Sisodia said that “it is a good time for parents to learn what the children learn at happiness classes and maybe it’ll help them too. Parents can do meditation with their children.”Some students asked about ways to beat boredom. Bhushan replied that already parents have been advised to conduct activities at homes for their wards.There were parents who posed the question of countering the negativity caused due to the news about coronavirus and deaths. To this, Dadwal who is also the CEO of Meraki Foundation said that people should be away from social media. “Start doing activities at home and create positivity. Let your children express themselves more. Do not suppress them or be angry at them.”Sisodia said that parents should make sure that students don’t go into depression due to the situation.Kejriwal later said that the government would extend this programme and conduct such sessions on a regular basis with various experts. “Our motive is to change this time of crisis into an opportunity.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74988953,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-34555,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-lockdown-spend-quality-time-with-kids-arvind-kejriwal-tells-parents/articleshow/74988957.cms

He also demanded a financial relief of Rs 1000 and ration to those not covered by PDS or below poverty line.

The former UP chief minister said the pandemic has left its impact on all, but farmers and those living below poverty line are the worst hit. There are lakhs of poor who neither have a ration card nor any government registration. ""The government should make arrangements to ensure they also get relief and also waive fees of students,"" he said.

The SP chief pointed out that the prime minister had during the Lok Sabha polls announced Rs 2000 aid to farmers for three months and in the present crises, farmers have been hit hard again. ""Relief to farmers and rural folk was hit by the gross negligence of lekhpals who have been assigned to supervise distribution of ration and food packets to poor,"" he said.

""Football has changed, because you don't go in for a 50-50 ball with the same intensity.""""The fear of what is happening in the world is always present. Mentally, you're not focused on the game, you are always thinking that opponents may have the disease.""The Primera Liga de Nicaragua is one of only four leagues believed to have survived the coronavirus lockdown, along with those in Belarus, Burundi and Tajikistan.Games in the Central American nation are being played behind closed doors but are being broadcast locally on television or live on Facebook.The refusal to shut down has drawn global attention to football in a nation that has long preferred baseball, a sport that is also resisting a lockdown in Nicaragua.The secretary general of the Nicaraguan Football Federation , Jose Maria Bermudez, said fans from around the world are now tuning in to watch games and bet on them.""We can tell from monitoring these things that more people are paying attention, particularly on betting sites,"" Bermudez said in a phone interview.""It has no effect on us financially - people win or lose money, we don't get more money - but we can see that people are following us because we are one of the few countries where football is still going on.""Bermudez also said with live sport almost entirely absent from the world's TV screens, at least one foreign company had been in touch with the local rights holder, state-run Canal 6, asking to broadcast Nicaraguan games live.That could result in a windfall for the unheralded league.Bermudez stressed that the 10-team league has not decided to complete their season, merely ""to keep playing for as long as the situation permits.""There are five regular season matches to play before the top four teams go into a semi-final and final round play-off expected to begin in late April.He pointed out that Nicaragua has recorded only a handful of cases of the new coronavirus and no deaths so far.""The situation here is almost normal, there are only four cases of coronavirus and three were imported,"" Bermudez said. ""We were given information by the health officials and we took a decision based on that. We are not the government, we run football.""""If things get worse or out of control we will have to suspend the tournament to protect lives.""The number of confirmed cases had risen to five by Friday.Players said they were not consulted about the decision to keep playing, which was taken after a meeting between the league and club owners, many of whom get financial support from the government of Nicaragua's authoritarian president Daniel Ortega Ortega has insisted Nicaragua is taking the most sensible approach to dealing with the pandemic. Critics say he wants to show the world that life in Nicaragua continues as normal.Washington imposed sanctions on Nicaragua following a crackdown on opposition protests in 2018. Some members of the European Union have accused Ortega of jailing and torturing political prisoners and banning human rights groups and media outlets, something the government denies.Some players lined up for games this week wearing masks and gloves.Players at Deportivo Las Sabanas club told Reuters they needed to keep playing to support their families, and half-jokingly said the newfound interest in Nicaraguan football could help win them a transfer to a bigger club.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74989036,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-123781,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/football/top-stories/nicaraguan-footballers-playing-on-but-players-fear-virus/articleshow/74989039.cms

We're already close to wrapping up the first quarter of 2020, and boy has it been an unpleasant ride. Apart from the global crisis, these past months have seen some highs and lows in the glamorous world of Bollywood. From Katrina Kaif and Vicky Kaushal (sort of) going public with their romance to Shilpa Shetty welcoming a daughter via surrogacy, Kareena Kapoor Khan making her official Instagram debut to Kanika Kapoor announcing she tested positive for COVID-19, here's a look back at celebrity posts that went viral on social media.Not the one to take body shaming lying down, actress Shruti Haasan in a lengthy social media post shut down trolls who constantly comment about her body type. She also went on to confess that she had gone under the knife and underwent plastic surgery, but also said she is not one to promote it nor is she against it. Sharing two photos of her makeover, she said, ""These two pictures have been taken three days apart. I’m sure there are women out there who relate to what I’m going to say. Most often I’m at the mercy of my hormones mentally and physically and over the years I work hard to try and have a healthy relationship with it. It isn’t easy. The pain isn’t easy the physical changes aren’t easy but what’s become easier to me is to share my journey. No one famous or not is in a position to judge another person. Ever. That’s just not cool. I’m happy to say this is my life my face and yes I’ve had plastic surgery which I’m not ashamed to admit. Do I promote it? No am I against it? No - it’s just how I choose to live. The biggest favour we can do for ourselves and others is just be and learn to accept the changes and the movement of our bodies and minds.”Ending her post on a positive note the actress added, “Spread love and be chill. I’m learning every day to love me for me just a little more because the greatest love story of my life is with myself and I hope yours is too.”Her post was received with a lot of love on social media.Actress Shilpa Shetty Kundra and her businessman husband Raj Kundra made the happy announcement that they were blessed with a beautiful baby girl, via surrogacy. In a social media post, the happy couple shared that their second child arrived on February 15.“Our prayers have been answered with a miracle. With gratitude in our hearts, we are thrilled to announce the arrival of our little Angel. Samisha Shetty Kundra. Born on 15th February 2020 Junior SSK in the house,” Shilpa said.She even revealed the meaning behind her unique name. “Sa’ in Sanskrit is “to have”, and ‘Misha’ in Russian stands for “someone like God”. You personify this name - our Goddess Laxmi and complete our family” she wrote.The couple is also parents to 8-year-old Viaan.After months of playing hide and seek with the shutterbugs, Vicky Kaushal and Katrina Kaif were finally captured on camera and fans of the two had Nick Jonas to thank.The singer and actor, who was having a gala time with wife Priyanka Chopra at his first Bollywood style birthday bash, filmed a video of himself and also seemed to have captured Vicky and Katrina dancing away in the background. His post quickly went viral and had social media bussing about the hot new couple.After a long wait, Kareena Kapoor Khan finally made her Instagram debut early this month. It didn't take too long for the word to spread and the actress had over 2 million followers within no time. This big debut came shortly after she expressed her desire to connect with her fans who had been pleading with her to join the Gram. From 'Welcome begum of Bollywood' to referring to her as 'the queen', fans shared their excitement on Bebo's post and also left some adorable comments.Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor was the first Indian star to confirm that she tested positive for COVID-19. Taking to her social media handle the singer made the shocking revelation that gave rise to an uproar on social media after reports claimed that the star didn't self-quarantine after returning from a trip to London. The Lucknow police even booked Kanika on charges of negligence for attending various social events in the city despite being infected with coronavirus and having been instructed by the authorities to isolate herself at her home.Since then, several people including family, friends and those she came in contact with have been tested for COVID-19. After testing positive five times, according to the latest reports, the singer tested finally tested negative but will be kept under observation.Soon after the novel coronavirus was declared a pandemic, Bollywood filmmakers did their bit to prevent the spread of the virus but deciding to postpone their films. Director Rohit was the first to announce that his film 'Sooryavanshi' with Akshay Kumar that was scheduled to release in March, would be postponed. Following the shutdown of theatres and the lockdown that brought Bollywood to a grinding halt, director Kabir Khan also announced that work on his film '83, starring Ranveer Singh in the lead, has been stopped until further notice.Salman Khan took to his Instagram to express his loss as his nephew Abdullah Khan passed away. Reportedly, the reason behind Abdullah's demise is a lung infection. He took his last breath in a Mumbai hospital on Monday. Sharing a picture Abdullah, he grieved his loss in a post that read, ""Will always love you...""Salman's close friend Iulia Vantur also posted a picture and captioned, ""As u said “we fall, we break, we fail but then we rise, we heal, we overcome” @aaba81 u left too soonFollowing the coronavirus pandemic, government officials, celebrities, public personalities all over the world began cautioning people about the deadly virus, but none did it as creatively as Kartik Aaryan . The actor, who is quite popular for delivering monologues in his films, made one such video about coronavirus in an effort to reach out to his fans in his trademark style. The clip was not only appreciated by his Bollywood pals and his fans but also won praise from the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi Amid the Coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown, Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar has been making the most of his time home with his twins Yash and Roohi. The director, who is known for his eccentric fashion choices, was in for a shock when his kiddos turned fashion critics and innocently trolled him for his flashy outfits. The two have since become a big hit on social media with fans, friends and Bollywood stars having a hearty laugh at KJo's expense.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74987725,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-140965/74987725.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/kanika-kapoor-contracting-covid-19-to-salman-khans-nephews-passing-social-media-posts-of-bollywood-stars-that-went-viral/articleshow/74987624.cms

92,['5/04/2020'],"Lockdown heroes: Within touching distance of virus, but duty calls","NEW DELHI: The story of Safdarjung Hospital nursing officer Amit Kansal deployed in the coronavirus ward is one of spirit and dedication. Across India, more than 50 healthcare workers have tested positive for Covid-19 and the fear of infection looms over the hospitals. Yet an undaunted Kansal spends over eight hours every day in the risky ward attending to the virus-positive patients and motivating them to fight it out.The 37-year-old has been working in the corona ward for two months. “The virus-positive patients have all the facilities inside the room and we monitor them digitally,” he explains when TOI met him during his night shift on Friday. “We talk to them over phone and visit them from time to time.” It has been a trying time for the Kansal couple, the wife too a nursing officer at Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences in Dilshad Garden.At home, he and his wife eat in separate utensils and use separate washrooms. His heart is torn when he cannot play with his two kids after returning from work. “I leave my shoes in the car, phone my mother to keep the doors of the house open so I don’t touch any object while entering,” he relates. “Regardless of whether I am tired or sleepy, I go straight for a hot-water bath and wash my clothes in hot water too.”Kansal, whose widowed mother is constantly fretting about his safety, hasn’t for tunately faced any discrimination in his housing society due to his daily nearness to the dangerous virus. But for the healthcare workers, it is an unnerving experience to be so close to Covid-19 patients and to think they could be risking the safety of their family. Kansal was terrified a few days ago when his 10-year-old daughter had cold and mild fever. It turned out it was only an ailment brought on by the change in season. “I will make all the sacrifices I have to while continuing to serve the country which needs all healthcare workers at this hour of crisis,”avers Kansal.At the newly constructed block at Safdarjung Hospital, which has been turned into the corona ward, over 30 patients are currently admitted. Treatment protocols are strictly followed by the healthcare workers, but there is a sense of foreboding in the corridors. Kansal’s determination overpowers his fears. “When we are required to go into the isolation rooms to give medicines, we wear personal protective equipment and the moment we come out, we discard the PPE kit to avoid infection,” says Kansal.While meeting the isolated patients, Kansal has encouraging words for them. “I tell them that confidence is the key,” he says. The nursing official has seen patients recover and go home. They are given a phone contact that they can dial in case they need help. Kansal’s advice to health workers is to follow the government guidelines strictly at work and to maintain social distancing at home, no matter how frustrating that can be. This is the only way to emerge victorious in the war against the novel coronavirus.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74989057,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-53106,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lockdown-heroes-within-touching-distance-of-virus-but-duty-calls/articleshow/74989057.cms

This would be detrimental to our NHS and other government-funded services.""The PFA added that the proposed 30% salary deduction over a 12-month period would equate to over 500 million pounds ($613.00 million) in wage reductions and a loss in tax contributions of over 200 million to the government.""What effect does this loss of earning to the government mean for the NHS? Was this considered in the Premier League proposal and did the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock factor this in when asking players to take a salary cut?"" the union asked in their statement.The union, which is mainly funded via Premier League broadcast revenue payments, said that the players were discussing how they could make a contribution during the pandemic crisis.""All Premier League players want to, and will, play their part in making significant financial contributions in these unprecedented times,"" the statement said.""All Premier League players fully appreciate their role and responsibilities in society during this current crisis.

CHANDIGARH: District education officer (DEO) Alka Mehta on Saturday asked all schools to send a compliance report of the Sunday 9pm ritual of lighting diyas and downloading Arogya app, as asked by the Prime Minister, by Monday.

The DEO, following orders by the ministry of human resource and development, asked schools to send details of how students were informed about downloading the app and how many followed the 9pm-9minute diya task. The circular was issued to principals of government, government aided and private schools.

Schools in their report have been asked to include ""whether advisory was given to field functionaries, the mode of communication to schools, teachers, students and parents, the number of teachers and parents who downloaded the app and students who participated in candle lighting. On Friday, the CBSE had sent a circular to schools to ensure parents, teachers and students comply with the PM's message.

A school principal, who is a member of Independent Schools Association, said, ""It is difficult to understand why CBSE has been giving us deadlines to inform parents and ensure compliance and the education department is seeking compliance report. We would rather spend time on enhancing modes of online teaching.""

AURANGABAD: Eight of 12 travellers from Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh, who had arrived at Nilanga in Latur district from Haryana on April 2, tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday.

Latur district collector G Shreekanth said the group was travelling from Ferozepur in Haryana in two vehicles on rent to Nilanga via Mathura and Dhule. ""They were issued emergency pass by the revenue department of Haryana, with help of which they crossed the borders.""

Shreekanth said the group had been to Delhi before going to Haryana, but it is yet to be ascertained whether they attended the Tablighi event or came into contact with those who had attended.

The group members, however, said they did not attend the Tablighi Jamaat event.

With the latest cases, the count of current Covid-19 patients in Marathwada has reached 13.

The group claimed that was going back home from Ferozepur in Haryana, but the driver of their vehicle dropped them midway and disappeared, following which they chose to stay at a religious place in Nilanga taluka.

On learning of the group's travel history, the Latur administration moved them to the Vilasrao Deshmukh Government Medical Science Institute (VDGMSI). Although they did not have symptoms, their throat swabs were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune.

Girish Thakur, dean of VDGMSI, told TOI that those who tested positive have been admitted to the medical college and are being treated according to government protocol. ""Currently, they are in an isolation ward and their condition is stable,"" he said.

April 5 marks the 15th anniversary of MS Dhoni 's first international century - a knock that marked his arrival as the ""next big thing in Indian cricket"".Overall, Dhoni has played 350 ODIs, with 10,773 runs and 10 centuries to his credit, with a highest score of an unbeaten 183 and an average of 50.57.Dhoni has not played since India's World Cup semi-final loss to New Zealand in July.Here is a look at the former Indian captain's greatest knocks in ODIs:After a few failures in his first four matches, Dhoni announced himself on the international stage with a swashbuckling innings against Pakistan, following captain Sourav Ganguly 's decision to promote him to the No. 3 batting slot.India were chasing 299 to win against a Lankan side that had Vaas and Muralitharan . Dhoni plundered the attack to help the hosts win with 23 balls to spare.Perhaps Dhoni 's most celebrated innings, coming as in it did in a World Cup final while chasing. MSD wasn't in the best of form till the final, but he promoted himself in the batting order to counter Sri Lanka's off-spinners. He made sure India won the World Cup after 23 years with an unforgettable six over long on.India were tottering at 154/6 but Dhoni made sure the team crossed the 300-run mark with another dominating innings peppered with his trademark 'helicopter' shot.Dhoni came up with another entertaining and resourceful knock in the final of a tri-series also involving West Indies. India needed 202 to win the title and were reduced to 167-8. Dhoni farmed the strike brilliantly and took the match into the last over with 15 runs to win. Shaminda Eranga was given the task to bowl the final over and Dhoni flattened him with a sequence of 6, 4, 6 off the second, third and fourth deliveries. India won by 1 wicket.Another of Dhoni's last-over heroics. At the receiving end this time was Australian medium-pacer Clint McKay . India needed 13 to win off the last over and Dhoni clobbered a 112 metre, awe-inspiring maximum to win the match for India.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74989161,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-269030,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/cricket/news/ms-dhonis-greatest-knocks-in-odis/articleshow/74989176.cms
108,['5/04/2020'],"Lockdown: Growing or greying, tresses add to stress","Some give their hair a break from colouring, blow-drying

MUMBAI: Prancing peacocks and dancing dolphins are all very well, but one of the less palatable things that nature has brought home thanks to the lockdown is-hair. While men are desperately seeking barbers and finally risking their wives to trim their locks, women are waking up in the mornings not recognising their grey selves.""There's no silver lining in silver hair,"" says a homemaker, adding her husband was not even aware of how grey she had gone. ""Women are going mental without access to the parlour -the big issues are grey hair and bushy eyebrows,"" adds hairstylist Aneesha Virani.Hair and beauty expert Kanta Motwani of Kromakay Salons says she gets an average of one call a day from women in distress. ""One of my clients called to say this (visiting the parlour) is the only thing that keeps her sane. You see, for many women, going to salons is therapy. When a client sits on a hairdresser's chair, its also about the conversation. We are like their caregivers-many don't even have the products they need to shampoo and condition their hair.""Men don't worry much about the grey. Some have grown their hair to make a ponytail. ""Or they can just go bald, the hair will grow back,"" Motwani adds. ""But if women really have a problem with the grey showing, I tell them, wear a scarf or tie it up, or cover it with a bandana, if it bothers them. But at least give it a little TLC by giving yourself a massage.""One south Mumbai school teacher says, “I’m actually letting my hair recover from all the colour and blow-drying... oiling it twice a week and letting it dry naturally. It’s quite liberating actually.” South Mumbai-based hair stylist Jehanbux Mogal says a few clients still ask if they can come over. “But I refuse because it’s not safe,” he says.While some rebellious teenagers are threatening to go bald, children are complaining about the heat and their overflowing sweaty strands. Recently, Jay Patel, a Malad-based education consultant, got so tired of his five-year-old son complaining crankily about his itching scalp, “I found a pair of clippers and decided to do it myself. I saved a thousand bucks and Trishaan was extremely happy.”Suresh Naik, a media professional, has been miserably searching for a barber since the lockdown. He found one outside Ghatkopar station.“When I besieged him, he told me he wouldn’t do it even if I paid him Rs 10,000,” says Naik with a groan.Social media has been buzzing with jokes and memes about home haircuts. One branded salon posted a ‘how to’ on cutting your own hair, and just as the viewer starts paying attention, the stylist stops and says, “Don’t even think about doing it on your own. Just wait until the lockdown is over.”In one post, actor Anushka Sharma can be seen giving her cricketer husband Virat Kohli a haircut.Meanwhile, actor Neena Gupta gave her fans a tip on dealing with the grey showing up. With no irony whatsoever, she whispered conspirationally to them on her Instagram handle: “Use your mascara to touch it up. It really works!”There is some concern that with men growing hair and women growing moustaches, gender parity may get a whole new look.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74989291,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-207773,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/growing-or-greying-tresses-add-to-stress/articleshow/74989190.cms

But it remains unclear what the pandemic's impact will be on the multiple wars roiling the Middle East.Here is an overview of the impact so far on the conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Libya and Iraq The COVID-19 outbreak turned into a pandemic just as a ceasefire reached by the two main foreign power brokers in Syria's nine-year-old war -- Russia and Turkey -- was taking effect.The three million people living in the ceasefire zone, in the country's northwestern region of Idlib, had little hope the deal would hold.Yet fears the coronavirus could spread like wildfire across the devastated country appear to have given the truce an extended lease of life.According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the month of March saw the lowest civilian death toll since the conflict started in 2011, with 103 deaths.The ability of the multiple administrations in Syria -- the Damascus government, the autonomous Kurdish administration in the northeast and the jihadist-led alliance that runs Idlib -- to manage the coronavirus threat is key to their credibility.""This epidemic is a way for Damascus to show that the Syrian state is efficient and all territories should be returned under its governance,"" analyst Fabrice Balanche said.However the pandemic and the global mobilisation it requires could precipitate the departure of US-led troops from Syria and neighbouring Iraq.This in turn could create a vacuum in which the Islamic State jihadist group, still reeling from the demise of its ""caliphate"" a year ago, could seek to step up its attacks.The Yemeni government and the Huthi rebels initially responded positively to the UN appeal for a ceasefire, as did neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which leads a military coalition in support of the government.That rare glimmer of hope in the five-year-old conflict was short-lived however and last week Saudi air defences intercepted ballistic missiles over Riyadh and a border city fired by the Iran-backed rebels.The Saudi-led coalition retaliated by striking Huthi targets in the rebel-held capital Sanaa on Monday.Talks have repeatedly faltered but the UN envoy Martin Griffiths is holding daily consultations in a bid to clinch a nationwide ceasefire.More flare-ups in Yemen could compound a humanitarian crisis often described as the worst in the world and invite a coronavirus outbreak of catastrophic proportions.In a country where the health infrastructure has collapsed, where water is a rare commodity and where 24 million people require humanitarian assistance, the population fears being wiped out if a ceasefire doesn't allow for adequate aid.""People will end up dying on the streets, bodies will be rotting in the open,"" said Mohammed Omar, a taxi driver in the Red Sea port city of Hodeida.Much like Yemen, the main protagonists in the Libyan conflict initially welcomed the UN ceasefire call but swiftly resumed hostilities.Fierce fighting has rocked the south of the capital Tripoli in recent days, suggesting the risk of a major coronavirus outbreak is not enough to make guns fall silent.Turkey has recently played a key role in the conflict, throwing its weight behind the UN-recognised Government of National Accord.Fabrice Balanche predicted that accelerated Western disengagement from Middle East conflicts could limit Turkish support to the GNA.That could eventually favour forces loyal to eastern-based strongman Khalifa Haftar, who launched an assault on Tripoli one year ago and has the backing of Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.Western countries have been hit hardest by the pandemic, which could prompt them to divert both military resources and peace-brokering capacity from foreign conflicts.A report by the International Crisis Group said European officials had reported that efforts to secure a ceasefire in Libya were no longer receiving high-level attention due to the pandemic.Iraq is no longer gripped by fully-fledged conflict but it remains vulnerable to an IS resurgence in some regions and its two main foreign backers are at each other's throats. Iran and the United States are two of the countries most affected by the coronavirus but there has been no sign of any let-up in their battle for influence that has largely played out on Iraqi soil.With most non-US troops in the coalition now gone and some bases evacuated, American personnel are now regrouped in a handful of locations in Iraq. Washington has deployed Patriot air defence missiles, prompting fears of a fresh escalation with Tehran, whose proxies it blames for a spate of rocket attacks on bases housing US troops.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74989195,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-452127,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/what-impact-is-coronavirus-having-on-middle-east-conflicts/articleshow/74989098.cms

The mass exodus of migrant labourers, who were left without work and means to earn two square meals a day when the lockdown was imposed, has disrupted the entire supply chain from manufacturer to retailers.

It has emerged as the second highest ward in terms of number of cases among the 24 civic administration wards in the city. Four more new cases were reported in the ward until Saturday evening.Most patients from the area are those who had travelled abroad in the last couple of months or are close family contacts of the travellers. In two instances, the security guard of a building and a driver contacted the virus from their employers, said BMC officials. The security guard had been living in a temporary structure within the premises of a building which had three members of a family who tested positive. The driver was living in along with three fellow employees, and all four tested positive.BMC officials stated that those from these areas are following the civic body’s home quarantine directives and are not posing any difficulties for the administration.Till Saturday morning, the G South ward that covers Worli, Lower Parel and Prabhadevi had reported 44 cases, the highest among all the wards in the city. While D ward came second, the thirdhighest number of cases were reported from K East ward, areas comprising Andheri East and Vile Parle East.

In her advance stage of pregnancy, the 24-year-old impoverished woman walked more than 500 kilometres from Mathura in Uttar Pradesh to Panna with thousands of other migrating labourers from the National Capital Region following the outbreak of Covid-19.Kalli Bai, a resident of Panna district, started her journey on March 29. Before she reached her village on March 31, she had not only walked a long distance, but also travelled five times in trucks - the only mode of travel available for some fortunate labourers during their arduous homeward journey.Kalli Bai delivered a healthy baby boy on Thursday and aptly named him Ram. ""He is Ram because he is born just a day before Ram Navami, the birthday of Bhagwan Ram "", she told doctors at a quarantine facility in remote Bariyarpur Bhumiyan village in Ajaygarh tehsil of Panna district.Both Kalli Bai and Ram are healthy and are looked after by us, said Dr K P Rajput , the in-charge at the isolation centre.Before the Covid-19 crisis, Kalli Bai and her husband Ramdeen Kevat were working near Mathura, but they lost their job after the construction site was closed.""Everybody started going home, we too joined them without any clue how we would reach our distant destination"", said Ramdeen.After walking a few kilometres, a truck driver gave us lift but we were dropped at a place some 22 kilometres away from Agra, Ramdeen said.

After travelling 200 kilometres, we were dropped at Jhansi, but the journey was extremely arduous "", he said.The couple used trucks thrice again to first reach Barua Sagar, near Jhansi, Harpalpur in Chhatarpur district and then Bamitha village, some 40 kilometres away from Ajaygarh.On April 2, Ram was born after a ""normal delivery without any complication"", doctors told the local media.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74989952,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-469236,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/after-500km-walk-migrant-labourer-delivers-baby-boy/articleshow/74989439.cms
125,['5/04/2020'],Arjun Kapoor’s sliders to Ranveer Singh’s loafers: 5 shoes Bollywood stars swear by,"Footwear lets your style and your individuality communicate better than almost anything else in your wardrobe. And, a man’s wardrobe is incomplete without a good pair of shoes. A man and his outfit are entirely assessed by the choice of shoes he chose to wear. So, what are you wearing to drift yourself through spring-summer style footwear trends this year? Well, we took a look at Bollywood stars and curated some cool summer shoe styles for you with help from Ambud Sharma, Founder and CEO Ligo Group of Escaro Royale, which specialises in handcrafted shoes.Boat shoes: Some shoes attract odour more than others, and once you have got the odour, it won't go away easily. All that heat in an enclosed shoe is bound to result in sweating, but sometimes, even sandals get smelly. So, to prevent sweat and smell from the feet, men can go for slips-on, loafers or boat shoes for a breezy summer.Choose sandals over flip flops: In summer, wearing a full open-toe sandal will minimise pressure on your bunions and won’t cause the toes to suffocate together, allowing them to move freely and comfortably. Also, they are suitable for long-distance walking in summer.Flexible shoe sole: Don’t forget to turn your attention to the softness of the leather and a flexible shoe sole. Flexible means the ability to bend, which holds utmost importance in summer. Always do the ‘bending’ test (i.e. bend the heel and the toe area towards one another). If the soles take a V form, then the shoes have exemplary flexibility.Pick up loafers: Loafers provide the best summer look that can work with both casual and business-appropriate apparel. This makes it one of the most adaptable shoes in the summer collection and a must-have shoe for men.Espadrilles: A flat and flexible shoe, they are usually made from canvas or cotton upper with a defining sole making it a perfect go-to summer footwear. Also, it is one of the most comfortable, lightweight and durable summer footwear enough to bust out even in the thickest heat, giving that super-casual silhouette look.Perforated shoes: Choosing shoes with sufficient room and pores are ideal for hot summer days. It provides not only much needed ventilation but also gives considerate airflow, thus making your foot less sweaty and airy.Mr. Ambud Sharma, Founder and CEO Ligo Group of Escaro Royale can share his thoughts on :",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74988024,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-767598/74988024.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/style-guide/arjun-kapoors-sliders-to-ranveer-singhs-loafers-5-shoes-bollywood-stars-swear-by/articleshow/74988024.cms

128,['5/04/2020'],How another pandemic gave rise to Karnataka’s health services,"Dozen rats, three annas

Birth of Basavanagudi, Malleswaram

The Covid pandemic has disrupted life all over the world, and three week lockdown, despite being necessary, has created a set of problems of its own. There’s an aura of fear and paranoia in the atmosphere. But then, pandemics are not new to India. It’s just that advances in technology and hygiene have made us forget them.It was August 11 of 1898 and a train of the Southern Mahratta Railway chugged into Bangalore Cantonment from Bombay via Hubli. A railway loco superintendent, followed by his butler, disembarked at the station. The railways had physical screening for plague as the illness had spread in Bombay presidency then, and a police constable would escort the passenger home to ascertain their residence and had to report for checks for 10 consecutive days. Similarly, railway staff realised that the butler showed symptoms of the epidemic. He goes into history as the first patient in Bangalore when he was confirmed with plague the following day and died on August 15, 1898.British official PR Cadell’s Report on the Outbreak of Plague in Bangalore 1898-99 records this incident but also points to a train with grains halting at Bangalore city station around the same time. Authorities quarantined the load workers, 22 of them, to the good shed area (then Godownpet) to contain the disease. The approach seemed successful until September 9. After that, the plague went out of control, spreading rapidly to the Cottonpet and Akkipet areas. The Bangalore District Gazetteer of 1998 recorded the rapid rise of mortality in Bangalore from September 19 as 105 deaths per week. By October, 1,393 plague attacks were recorded and 2,807 died in the pete area alone. That December, the cantonment had 1547 casualties.The Bangalore yearly administration report of 1898-99 had recorded the government allotting Rs 2,45,790 as Plague Fund to control the epidemic and a Plague Commission being appointed. The municipality purchased 22 carts with 22 pairs of bullocks for Rs 2,565 and handed them over to new sweepers to remove dead bodies from drains, dustbins and even public toilets.The Commission began supervising plague control and observation through special camps set up on Magadi Road, then on the city outskirts. Celebrations and festivals were cancelled, the Yeswantpur railway station was converted into a medical inspection spot for persons coming into the city. Persons showing mild symptoms of plague were quarantined in 588 sheds for a 10-day period with compulsory segregation. Handbills and notices spreading awareness and explaining symptoms of the epidemic were distributed on bullock carts. Drains were cleaned, 18,438 houses disinfected, 651 houses declared inhabitable demolished and 36,259 people inoculated as plague prevention.Municipal authorities offered six annas for a dozen dead bandicoots, three annas for a dozen rats and two annas for a dozen mice - in an effort to reduce the rodent population, believed to be plague vectors. The reward remained in force till 1911.In 1896 as part of a city expansion plan, plots for sale were divided in Basavanagudi and Malleswaram layouts by local authorities. But there were hardly any takers. The plague epidemic in Bangalore drastically changed that with people who remained in the city during the spread moving to the two areas and pitching tents to escape the outbreak.“People were desperate for good and spacious living conditions, fresh water and wider roads like never before after witnessing the rampant spread of plague in cramped Petta areas. Thereafter, Basavanagudi and the Malleswaram areas that were mostly open grounds were occupied by people later leading to the development of the localities,” said Suresh Moona, city historian and columnist.Padmanabhan Palpu, a famous doctor and bacteriologist from Kerala, was posted as the first health officer for a monthly salary of Rs 400 during the plague outbreak. He played a key role in containing the spread in Bangalore. The Mysore Maharaja later felicitated Palpu for arduous service to state and he was instrumental in setting up the Victoria Hospital here.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74989528,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-233979,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/how-another-pandemic-gave-rise-to-karnatakas-health-services/articleshow/74989519.cms

Eligibility criteria:

A flexible domestic calendar:

Availability of venues:

CHENNAI: The Under-17 Women's World Cup to be hosted by India is the latest sporting event to fall victim to the Covid-19 pandemic.In a statement issued late on Friday, FIFA announced that the tournament will be postponed and new dates will be announced soon. The women's age-group showpiece event was scheduled to be held from November 2-21 across five venues - Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar, Guwahati, Kolkata and Navi Mumbai.The decision was made following the first meeting of the FIFA-Confederations working group, which was established by the FIFA Council bureau to address the consequences of the pandemic. ""FIFA reiterates that health must always be the first priority and the main criteria in any decision-making process, especially in these challenging times. The working group thus recommended postponing the Under-17 Women's World Cup. New dates will be identified,"" FIFA said in a statement.What might have forced FIFA's hand is the fact that majority of the qualifying tournaments - in Europe, South America, Central, North America and Caribbean and Oceania for the World Cup had to be postponed due to the ongoing crisis. Out of the 16 teams that will take part in the event, Japan and North Korea - from the Asia (AFC) region - are the only sides to have qualified so far while African region ( CAF ) qualifiers are still going on.In order to identify alternative dates for the qualifiers, FIFA has also decided ""to create a sub-working group on the women's international match calendar to consider potential changes to the calendar and dates of postponed FIFA final tournaments"".However, it is unlikely that the World Cup will be rescheduled anytime sooner than October next year because of the onset of summer from March in the country. A lot of teams aren't used to such extreme climate and a FIFA spokesperson acknowledged the issue at hand. ""We are working with confederations regarding dates for the respective qualifying tournaments. We will definitely take into account the weather conditions in India before zeroing in on new dates,"" the spokesperson told TOI. ""There is no guarantee that the tournament will be held before October (2021). It all depends on the next available window on FIFA's calendar. We have to work out our domestic calendar for next season and be flexible. The five stipulated venues were barred from hosting other tournaments and events in the lead up to the event,"" Das told TOI.No clarity yet on whether the present eligibility criteria originally foreseen (players born on or after January 1, 2003) for the tournament will remain or not.Flexibility needed in domestic calendar since it might have to be rejigged if FIFA decides to conduct the WC any time before April next yearWith AIFF not owning any stadiums, the football body will need to draw fresh contracts for the availability of five venues.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74989554,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-107500,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/football/top-stories/fifa-postpones-womens-u-17-world-cup/articleshow/74989570.cms

As Tamil Nadu geared up for a tough phase of dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, health minister C Vijayabaskar says the state had ordered one lakh rapid test kits that will help public health authorities screen hot spots. “We will be ready before the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) releases its final advisory on the use of rapid test kits,” he tells TOI. Excerpts from the interview by Pushpa Narayan & Jaya Menon

Experts say the peak is yet to begin. How will TN handle it?

Besides setting aside beds in government hospitals, declaring some as exclusive Covid-19 facilities, we are talking to private hospitals and medical colleges. Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research in Porur has promised to allot 1,500 beds, Saveetha Medical College and MIOT have promised 500.

Do not have enough testing kits?

We have placed orders for one lakh rapid test kits. They will arrive on April 10 and will be used in several hot spots. In a week, ICMR will come out with an advisory on using these kits. We will be ready by then. The test used now, called PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, uses a nasal or throat swab for screening. The results take five hours. The rapid test uses a blood sample and gives results based on detecting certain antibodies that react with the coronavirus protein.

Tamil Nadu is accused of not testing enough people when asymptomatic people can be spreading the disease.

Testing is being done as per ICMR protocol. Of the 170 testing centres across India, we have 17. This includes 11 in the government sector. We will add 10 more this week. People with travel history, contacts with people with travel history who tested positive, people hospitalised with severe acute respiratory infections are all being tested.

Are you interacting with medical experts abroad?

We have been interacting with the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, World Health Organisation, World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency and several senior physicians, virologists and infectious diseases experts. We have discussed the guidelines for testing, isolation, treatment and contract tracing methodologies given by ICMR which has reassured us that we are on the right path.

What are the lessons from such interactions?

We learned the success and failure paths from countries. For instance, we realised that lockdown wasn’t effective in the UK. They continued to have incoming flights from Italy. We decided not to follow their herd immunity theory. We realised that our lockdown has to push back the virus. We also learned to disinfect areas, like China did.

Is the health department working with medical colleges and experts within the state?

Yes. We are collaborating with the Christian Medical College in Vellore to isolate the strain of the virus. We want to study if there is a mutation.

Why are we seeing a lot of cases during the lockdown?

Because it is a cluster. We tracked every (Tablighi Jamaat) member who attended the conference (in Delhi last month), isolated and tested them. We have launched a micro containment plan and screenings show no community spread. We expect the numbers to come down soon.

How will you ensure private hospitals don’t jack up bills of patients?

Up to 70% of the population is covered by some form of government insurance. Most of them have cashless cards where no additional payment is required. Many others who work in corporates have group medical insurance. For the small percentage of people who don’t have any insurance, treatment is free at all government hospitals.

You have declared it as a disaster. Do you have adequate funds to handle the situation?

The state released ₹60 crore initially. The CM announced ₹500 crore relief in the assembly. Now we have ₹3,200 crore. The CM is monitoring the contingency measures.

Are you interacting with medical experts abroad?

We have been interacting with the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, World Health Organisation, World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency and several senior physicians, virologists and infectious diseases experts. We have discussed the guidelines for testing, isolation, treatment and contract tracing methodologies given by ICMR which has reassured us that we are on the right path.

What are the lessons from such interactions?

We learned the success and failure paths from countries. For instance, we realised that lockdown wasn’t effective in the UK. They continued to have incoming flights from Italy. We decided not to follow their herd immunity theory. We realised that our lockdown has to push back the virus. We also learned to disinfect areas, like China did.

Is the health department working with medical colleges and experts within the state?

Yes. We are collaborating with the Christian Medical College in Vellore to isolate the strain of the virus. We want to study if there is a mutation.

Why are we seeing a lot of cases during the lockdown?

Because it is a cluster. We tracked every (Tablighi Jamaat) member who attended the conference (in Delhi last month), isolated and tested them. We have launched a micro containment plan and screenings show no community spread. We expect the numbers to come down soon.

How will you ensure private hospitals don’t jack up bills of patients?

Up to 70% of the population is covered by some form of government insurance. Most of them have cashless cards where no additional payment is required. Many others who work in corporates have group medical insurance. For the small percentage of people who don’t have any insurance, treatment is free at all government hospitals.

You have declared it as a disaster. Do you have adequate funds to handle the situation?

The state released ₹60 crore initially. The CM announced ₹500 crore relief in the assembly. Now we have ₹3,200 crore. The CM is monitoring the contingency measures.

As Tamil Nadu geared up for a tough phase of dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, health minister C Vijayabaskar says the state had ordered one lakh rapid test kits that will help public health authorities screen hot spots. “We will be ready before the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) releases its final advisory on the use of rapid test kits,” he tells TOI. Excerpts from the interview by Pushpa Narayan & Jaya Menon

Experts say the peak is yet to begin. How will TN handle it?

Besides setting aside beds in government hospitals, declaring some as exclusive Covid-19 facilities, we are talking to private hospitals and medical colleges. Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research in Porur has promised to allot 1,500 beds, Saveetha Medical College and MIOT have promised 500.

We have placed orders for one lakh rapid test kits. They will arrive on April 10 and will be used in several hot spots. In a week, ICMR will come out with an advisory on using these kits. We will be ready by then. The test used now, called PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, uses a nasal or throat swab for screening. The results take five hours. The rapid test uses a blood sample and gives results based on detecting certain antibodies that react with the coronavirus protein.

BENGALURU: The state government on Saturday granted permission for the annual Karaga , Bengaluru's oldest and hugely popular festival, but with a rider.

Chief minister BS Yediyurappa said not more than five people would participate in the event which starts at the Dharmaraya Swamy Temple in Nagarathpet, Old Bengaluru.

The government banned all festivals and fairs last week after the lockdown kicked in to ensure social distancing. He relaxed the lockdown norms for the Karaga, reportedly under pressure from local MLAs who believed that doing away with the ritual would incur divine wrath and portend bad times.

The event, associated with the Thigala community, attracts lakhs of devotees every year.

It's scheduled to be held on April 8 this year.

After six days, they reached Salem early on Saturday morning. After covering a certain distance by foot, they again hitchhiked on multiple trucks carrying essential commodities and reached Musiri in Trichy district via Namakkal district. ""Since we could not find trucks from Musiri, we walked all the way to Trichy city. Though shelter and food were provided at our workplace in Solapur, we were desperate to return home and meet our families,"" S Rahul, one of the youths told TOI.

At Thiruvanaikoil, locals assured to help them after hearing about their inter-state journey Subsequently, they approached the district administration with the required documents seeking permission to travel.

The previous month, 1,085 complaints were lodged, while in January, 986 people complained.Over the course of 2019, the cyber police had received a total of 7,795 complaints.Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale attributed the drop to the lockdown, which has restricted the movement of cyber criminals in hotspots like Noida, Delhi, Kolkata, Rajasthan and Jharkhand. ""Also, police action on illegal call centres in places like Delhi has contributed to the drop,"" he said.Between March 12 (when the initial Covid-19 positive cases were reported in the city) and March 29, the police received 305 complaints. ""We are conducting an inquiry into all 305 complaints, but no offence has been registered yet,"" Morale said.The ACP said most cybercrime is committed outside the state and even the country. ""It is imperative that we create awareness among the public. We have formed dedicated teams for this purpose. People must be on their guard, even though crooks use innovative methods. If we are vigilant, cybercrime will drop on its own,"" Morale said.""The average number of daily complaints to the cybercrime police station has dropped to three-and-a-half,"" deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Sambhaji Kadam told TOI.An official from the cyber police station said educated youths from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, most of whom work at illegal call centres, have returned home after the virus outbreak - one reason for the drop in such crime. ""That said, Puneties continue to receive calls from fraudsters impersonating bank officials, urging them to upgrade KYC details and share their OTPs, among other details,"" the officer said.""Fraudsters have launched apps and websites and send links related to coronavirus to fool people into transferring money,"" cybersecurity expert Niranjan Reddy said, adding, ""They cheat people by sending messages regarding coronavirus tests, donations to buy ventilators for patients, or even giving money to the PM's or CM's relief funds.

On Saturday, he had said, “We are still to take a call on the method to be followed. But everything depends on how people behave. For now, they need to follow the rules (and stay indoors).”However, sources in the health department said that two main options were to either continue the lockdown for another 28 days or stagger it with periods of breaks that would help people buy stuff or continue with their jobs. “A new study from Cambridge University has said that a 49-day period is the best way to break the transmission chain most effectively,” said the official.However, not many are in favour of this method because of the economic hardships it would mean for the people. The other method is to provide a partial relaxation for five to seven days. This could be regionwise or at the corporation-level, even at the ward-level. “Depending on our data, we could work out a system where the worst hotspots could be continue to be sealed for a longer period,” said the official. The Cambridge University paper had suggested that the best lockdown method is to first observe it for 21 days, and thereafter, with two five-day breaks, continue it for 28 days and another 18 days. Experts say that the two-month-plus lockdown is the best to break the infection completely, with the Cambridge model suggesting that less than 50 cases would remain at the end of the entire lockdown.Bhopal-based public health specialist Dr Anant Bhan said that there cannot be a total return to normalcy at the end of April 14. “It has to be gradual and in some parts of the country where Covid-19 cases are high, the lockdown has to continue in some form,” he said.The decision will have to be taken on evidence and data generated during the ongoing lockdown, said experts. “Focus areas could have more of the lockdown, while other areas could have higher movement,” said Dr Bhan.However, health minister Tope said lifting the lockdown – even in a phase-wise manner – would depend on “people’s discipline” and their willpower to not gather in crowds”.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74991664,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-757876,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/phase-wise-removal-of-lockdown-or-extension-plan/articleshow/74989714.cms

LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said we cannot let down our guard and it is imperative to continue the practice of social distancing and follow all prescribed preventive measures if the 21-day lockdown is lifted on April 15 or else there will be chaos.

Interacting with MLAs and MLCs through video conferencing, CM Yogi said if coronavirus spread is not curtailed before winter.

Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverage

“We have to lift the lockdown in phases to ensure that there are no crowds. We need your support to implement this. UP’s health system needs strengthening for which we have started a fund and request you to donate to it. We have to control the spread of the virus before winter. Till now, we thought we had it under control, but the Tablighi Jamaat triggered infection and we saw a sudden spike in cases,” CM Yogi said.

“UP’s first positive case was reported on March 3 and 121 patients had tested positive till April 2. However, between April 3 and 4, these numbers went up suddenly,” he added.

“Out of 227 cases so far, 94 are those who attended Delhi jamaat and came here. This figure is likely to go up because of violation of social distancing norms and lack of awareness,” he said.

Yogi appealed to legislators to prepare list of dailywagers like rickshawpullers, labourers, vendors and their bank details so that government can transfer Rs 1,000 in their accounts as assistance. He sought their assistance in getting ration cards made for those who do not have food so that they can get free ration.

Yogi also appealed them to encourage people to participate in PM Narendra Modi’s call to switch off lights at 9pm on Sunday and light up diyas, torches or mobile flashlights for nine minutes. “Fans, air-conditioners, coolers, street lights and hospital lights will remain on. Only lights are to be switched off,” he said.

PUNE: Shooting is an individual sport. Shooters are not affected much due to the lockdown , since they can train at home.

This holds true for most of the shooters at the moment, but not for Tokyo quota winners Rahi Sarnobat and Abhishek Verma .

While the nationwide lockdown has affected many sportspersons in more ways than one, it has caught Rahi and Abhishek unprepared. Both the shooters went home for a couple of days and are now on a forced vacation.

""My father got transferred to Chandigarh (from Fatehabad in Haryana ) 15 days ago, so I went to meet my parents for two days. As I reached Chandigarh, the lockdown was announced and I couldn't go back to Gurgaon, where I train. Since I came to help my parents with unpacking, I didn't carry my shooting equipment with me,"" Abhishek, an Asian Games bronze medallist, told TOI.

""We had a range in the old house, but since this house is new, it is not possible,"" Abhishek, son of a district & sessions judge, said.

Rahi found herself in a similar situation. ""I train at Balewadi ranges in Pune, but since the complex may be turned into a quarantine facility, it is shut for regular sporting activity. Considering I would not get to shoot in Pune, I came to Kolhapur as I have a range close to my house,"" World Cup gold medallist Rahi, said.

""But just next to the range, the authorities found a couple of coronavirus patients and the whole area has been sealed,"" she added.

Customers on the Swiggy app were greeted with a ticker that said the move was meant 'to minimize contact between you and the delivery partner'.

There has been a sharp drop in home delivery orders since customers are wary to order food from restaurants, said Hotel and Restaurants' Association of Eastern India secretary Sudesh Poddar. ""For most standalone restaurants, it is not feasible to operate kitchens depending solely on online delivery. Those which have always depended on home delivery orders, however, are operating for a reduced period. With the pandemic still raging, we don't see a return to normalcy soon,"" said Poddar. He said even if restaurants operated their kitchens for online orders, the volume of business is likely to be extremely low.

The Tablighi incident resulted in a spike that was not consistent with the trend line. However, with no room for complacency, one slip meant going back to square one, he added.The home ministry’s control room, along with administrations of states, has launched a massive effort to track Tabilighi members, including hundreds of foreigners, who were in the markaz in numbers that violated the Delhi government’s restrictions on religious gatherings. The Centre also remained concerned about reports of some Tablighi members in medical facilities misbehaving with female nursing staff and senior sources in government said their conduct was under watch.The government said 22,000 Tablighi members and their contacts related to the religious event had been quarantined and many others were being traced.“Massive efforts are going on in across 17 states which have reported cases related to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation,” home ministry joint secretary Punya Salila Srivastava said.The 17 states (and Union territories) are Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala, Delhi, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.The Tablighi Jamaat held two conferences last month and a large number of members remained cooped up even after a national lockdown was ordered.“It is an everyday battle for us.

I can't tell you a date but I think it's going to be sooner rather than later.""Major League Baseball and NBA officials are reportedly studying plans to play games without spectators at neutral venues to minimise the risks of infection associated with crowded arenas.Trump, however, spoke optimistically of fans eventually being let back into stadiums.""We're not going to have separation for the rest of our times on the planet,"" Trump said.""We need it for this period of time. But eventually people are going to be able to occupy those seats next to each other. I'm not committing to it. It would be great if we could.""The NFL has so far made no plans to alter the start of its 2020-2021 season, with pre-season games usually starting in August.However California Governor Gavin Newsom was sceptical of the possibility of sports resuming in August or September.Speaking at his daily briefing, Newsom warned of a possible resurgence in infections if sport returned to soon.Asked about the possibility of fans heading to stadiums in September, Newsom said: ""I'm not anticipating that happening in this state."" ""We've all seen the headlines in the last couple of days in Asia where they were opening up certain up businesses and now they're starting to roll back those openings because there's some spread, a boomerang,"" Newsom said.""One has to be very cautious not to over-promise. I have a lot of friends that work in Major League Baseball and the NFL and basketball who have been asking me. I would move very cautiously.""I'm not here to second guess anybody, but I am here to say this: our decision on that basis, at least here in the state of California will be determined by the facts, by the health experts and our capacity to bend the curve.""",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74989877,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-318683,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/more-sports/others/donald-trump-hopes-virus-hit-sport-back-sooner-than-later/articleshow/74989752.cms

'Safe and appropriate'

LONDON: Liverpool were accused of betraying their ""morals and values"" for their move to furlough non-playing staff during the coronavirus pandemic as Premier League stars warned of a £200 million ($245 million) shortfall in government coffers if 30 percent wage cuts were introduced.Premier League leaders Liverpool said they would top up the public money made available from the government to ensure staff on temporary leave received their full salaries.It follows similar moves by Newcastle, Tottenham, Bournemouth and Norwich to take advantage of the scheme, under which employers can claim for 80 percent of furloughed employees' wages.But former Reds players Jamie Carragher and Stan Collymore strongly criticised the move by the European champions, who in February announced pre-tax profits of £42 million ($51 million) for 2018/19.""(Manager) Jurgen Klopp showed compassion for all at the start of this pandemic, senior players heavily involved in @premierleague players taking wage cuts. Then all that respect & goodwill is lost, poor this @LFC,"" tweeted Carragher.Collymore was even more forthright, tweeting: ""I don't know of any Liverpool fan of any standing that won't be anything other than disgusted at the club for furloughing staff.""Another former Anfield star, Germany's Dietmar Hamann tweeted: ""Astonished by the news that @LFC takes advantage of the furlough scheme to claim 80% of non-playing staff wages back off the government.""That's not what the scheme was designed for. Contrary to the morals and values of the club I got to know."" Liverpool said staff would be paid 100 percent of their salaries to ensure nobody was financially disadvantaged.A statement from the club said: ""Even prior to the decision on staff furloughing, there was a collective commitment at senior levels of the club -- on and off the pitch -- with everyone working towards a solution that secures jobs for employees of the club during this unprecedented crisis.""Meanwhile, the Professional Footballers' Association warned of a £200 million shortfall in British government tax revenues if a 30% pay cut was introduced for players.""All Premier League players want to, and will, play their part in making significant financial contributions in these unprecedented times,"" said a PFA statement after a meeting with the Premier League.""We welcomed the opportunity to discuss this and we are happy to continue talks."" However, the PFA insisted it was too simplistic to criticise multi-millionaire players for not easily agreeing to salary cuts.""The proposed 30 percent salary deduction over a 12-month period equates to over ?500m in wage reductions and a loss in tax contributions of over £200m to the government,"" the PFA statement added.""What effect does this loss of earning to the government mean for the National Health Service?""The Premier League has been seen as lagging behind other European leagues in its response to coronavirus and was accused by one British lawmaker of operating in a ""moral vacuum"".In Spain, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid players have already agreed to pay cuts of 70% while the stars of Italian champions Juventus will be paid a reduced amount for the next four months.England defender Danny Rose, on loan at Newcastle from Tottenham, told the BBC players were ""keen to make something happen"".""I can only speak for myself but I would have no problems whatsoever contributing some of my wages to people who are fighting this on the front line and to people who have been affected by what's happening at the minute,"" he said.On Friday, a hospital in London identified Rose as the individual behind a £19,000 donation.Liverpool skipper Jordan Henderson has led talks between Premier League club captains over what action they could take, a move that began before Britain's Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday joined those singling out footballers.""It was just not needed for people who are not involved in football to tell footballers what they should do with their money,"" added Rose.""I found that so bizarre.""Burnley issued a stark warning on Saturday about the potential financial fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, claiming they would face a shortfall of up to £50 million ($61 million) if it were not possible to complete the season.The English top-flight said on Friday the 2019/20 season would only return when it was ""safe and appropriate to do so"".The league agreed to provide a £125 million fund for the English Football League and National League and pledged £20 million in charitable support for the National Health Service and other groups.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74989909,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-184691,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/football/epl/top-stories/liverpool-blasted-over-virus-furlough-players-in-200m-wage-cut-warning/articleshow/74989887.cms

However, not everyone is into playing games like PUBG Mobile or Call of Duty Mobile. Games can be simple, fun and can be played together on WhatsApp groups too.

These games on WhatsApp and Facebook groups will help you engage everyone and may offer a break from the tense conversations around coronavirus . This will also help you keep in touch with friends and family and all of them can have fun together playing these games. Here are 6 games to play on WhatsApp or Facebook groups...

Kiss, Marry, Kill

This is a very interesting game to play with friends. In this game, players can ask other players who’d they Kiss, Marry and Kill from the three given options. These options can be anything such as cricket players, celebrities or even the members of the group.

Text Antakshari

Antakshari is already a popular game played among friends and family. However, Antakshari over WhatsApp is slightly different. Here you will need to write the lyrics instead of singing it. Well, there’s an option to record and send voice notes, but that might not be as interesting as texts.

Once upon a time… or Storyline

One person from the group writes Once upon a time in the group and other players or members are supposed to add more lines after it to make it into an interesting story in 15 seconds. The game can be more fun if it is being played between college or school friends who know all your secrets.

What's the first thing that came to your mind

The game is simple, but it is more suitable when played on a personal chat. All you need to do is write a word on chat and the other player needs to reply to the first thing that came to his/her mind.

Guess the word

The game takes its cue from the popular game we used to play as kids. All you need to do is scramble a word and send it on the group with a hint. Other members are supposed to guess the correct word.

20 Questions

If you are a 90s kid, then you must have heard about this game. If not, the rule is very simple. It is a turn-based game and players need to think or choose an object e.g. Cup. Now, other members of the group have to guess the object by asking questions in Yes/No format. For example: Are you a game? Then the player will answer as ‘No’ because Cup is not a game. Then they will move to another question, Is it cutlery? Then you’ll say ‘Yes’. This will continue with 20 questions limit or until other players figure out the name of the object.

With no guests dropping by and nowhere to step out, Mukerji has been able to finish a canvas and start work on two others. By the time the lockdown is over, he hopes to have a corona collection that would reveal vignettes of life in a city when it was on pause mode.""The lockdown has provided me with an opportunity to concentrate on the canvas. I start in the morning and am fully immersed in painting as long as I can. It has taken me seven days to complete the first canvas, much quicker than I would probably have had the lockdown not been in place. The absence of distraction has provided me with the leisure to do what I love,"" recounted Mukerji.The painting that he has completed, titled 'Ballygunge Pavement Eatery', depicts a man seated on a bench, peeling a vegetable in the company of a mongrel. Mukerji says he has been aware of the man, who runs a pavement eatery opposite Ballygunge Science College, for several years. ""I would often pass the eatery and see the man, Subhas , and the dog. It was perhaps the equanimity with which he carried on with his life, unhindered by the hustle and bustle on the road, that drew my attention,"" he said.While the man may have been difficult to sight when life went on as usual, the lockdown has made his presence conspicuous on the deserted street. ""While we may have been hassled by the lockdown, he appeared unnerved and as composed as ever. What struck me was the diligence and dignity of the man and the obvious loyalty of his pet. I hope I have been able to get this across in the painting,"" the artist said.The Sunny Park resident, who was invited by APJ Abdul Kalam to do a series on Rashtrapati Bhavan in 2004 when he was President, and has even done a series on Raj Bhavan in Kolkata in 2008 on former Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi's request, hopes to present his artwork at an exhibition in London once the battle against coronavirus is over.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74990013,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-189591,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/artist-finds-opportunity-in-lockdown/articleshow/74989944.cms

175,['5/04/2020'],I had sympathy for Kevin Pietersen over IPL: Andrew Strauss,"Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Strauss. (Getty Images)

LONDON: Former England captain Andrew Strauss admitted that he didn't handle Kevin Pietersen well during his time at the helm as the flamboyant batsman should have been given some space despite not exactly adhering to the team ethos.

However, Strauss maintained that while he understands why IPL is necessary for players, he still doesn't agree that one should play the cash-rich Indian Premier League at the cost of Test cricket as it would set a dangerous precedent.

Strauss and Pietersen had a major fallout due to their difference of opinion with regards to ECB policy on IPL.

""I always had sympathy with KP over the IPL,"" Strauss said on a Sky Sports podcast.

""I understood what a big event it was with all the best players playing there together and huge amounts of money on the table as well.""

It must be mentioned that when Strauss became ECB's 'Director of Cricket' he created a window for England players to play IPL, something Pietersen advocated for the longest time.

""Long term my view was that we had to find a window for the IPL. I told the ECB we couldn't compete against each other as it is going to create massive issues within our team.""

""But I thought it was incredibly dangerous to allow players to miss Test cricket to play in the IPL. The message you'd be sending and the precedent you'd be setting is that the IPL is more important than Test cricket,"" he added.

Strauss said that he repeatedly tried to make Pietersen aware why Test cricket is more important.

""I was saying to KP at the time, 'listen, mate, this is the situation. You can't opt in or out of international cricket. You've got obligations to England and hopefully there are gaps where you can play in the IPL as well'.""

After being dropped for good in 2014-15, Pietersen had hit out at some of his teammates like Matt Prior and Stuart Broad in his autobiography, which also included criticism of Strauss for not supporting him.

In hindsight, Strauss feels he could have cut a little slack with the maverick batsman.

""I think instead I just let KP be KP. In retrospect that was a mistake and might have sowed the seeds for what was to come down the track,"" Strauss admitted.

Strauss made it clear that Pietersen wasn't exactly the team-man but the England dressing room should have been more accepting.

""I don't think he would have been in the engine-room of the team in that sense but I've always felt a good team environment embraces difference and finds a space for everyone. I think we did that for large periods of time but possibly through neglect, KP became increasingly isolated,"" Strauss said.

""Often KP wanted to be the guy who was slightly separate from the team. On any given day it didn't feel like an issue but over time it became an issue.""

Some of the controversies related to Pietersen included sending text messages to South African players during the 2012 Test series between the two sides and allegedly insulting Strauss in them.

He was dropped after the 'Text-gate' scandal and although he was later brought back into the side, Pietersen's England career came to an end after the 2013-14 Ashes after Alastair Cook 's side had lost 5-0.

""Would I do things massively differently if I had my time again? Probably not. The worst thing you can do for players like KP is to straitjacket them and say 'you have to abide by x, y and z. You can't go and play in a flamboyant way, you have to grind it out like Jonathan Trott'.""

""Effectively you'd be asking him to be someone he's not, so you had to cut him some slack and allow him to be himself.""

""At times, though, what worked for KP almost undermined what the team was trying to do. It felt like there were two completely separate agendas there and that became a problem for me, the rest of the team and [then head coach] Andy Flower.

""We were all tired, emotional and had spent so much time in each other's pockets. Probably if we had a bit more space to think clearly it might not have got to that stage and we might have managed it better.""

But Strauss doesn't have any regrets for the reprimands that the stylish batsman got for his alleged off-field misdemeanours.

""But I don't look back and think 'we were wrong to call KP out over some of the things he did'. I think we had to do that.""

KOLKATA: The Mohammedan Burial Board has written to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation ( KMC ) to keep the burial grounds in the city closed on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat next week.

Members of the Muslim community visit the burial grounds and mosques at night to pray for the deceased in their families. Thousands of people visit the four burial grounds in the city on the occasion of shab-e-barat which falls in the middle of the three-week lockdown.

The board has also urged people to pray at home and not venture out to visit the burial grounds and mosques on Shab-e-Barat.

""We have to take utmost care to break the transmission chain of coronavirus. Any assembly of people will defeat the purpose of lockdown and social distancing. We have written to the KMC and received assurance that the burial grounds will be closed on Shab-e-Barat. Only those coming for burial on that day will be allowed and that too only very close relatives of the deceased,"" said Sheheryar Ali Mirza, member of the Mohammedan Burial Board.

The four burial grounds in the city are managed by the health department of the civic body and Mohammedan Burial Board decides on several important issues pertaining to the burial grounds and advises the health department on the same.

For the past two weeks, Friday prayers have been stopped in the mosques. People have been offering prayers at home. Management authorities of several mosques have also issued notifications urging people to pray at home on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat.

CHENNAI: In a move that has triggered criticism, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan's (SSA) Tamil Nadu project directorate has directed headmasters of government and aided schools to collect the details of how many teachers and students respond to the Prime Minister's call to light lamps and candles and switch on cellphone torchlights on Sunday night.

Maneesh Garg, joint secretary, department of school education and literacy, Union ministry of human resource development, has issued a direction to all states to gather information on advisory to schools, mode of communication to students and parents, and number of students who participated.

The SSA state project directorate has forwarded his letter to all chief educational officers and district educational officers directing headmasters to gather the details.

""Since there are no platforms to communicate with students and their parents studying in government and government-aided schools, it is not possible to gather the information,"" said a headmaster from a city school. Officials have forwarded the directions through WhatsApp. ""This exercise is useless. Instead of gathering information on how many students are lighting candles, we may gather information on how many students are getting food during the lock down,"" said A Peter Raja, president, Tamil Nadu High and Higher School Headmasters' Association.

Tamil Nadu Students Parents Welfare Association president S Arumainathan said there was no need to involve the teachers and students in the exercise as it would not lead to any ""meaningful outcome"".

Officials from Samagra Shiksha Abhiyhan were not available for comment.

188,['5/04/2020'],Mumbai churches prepare to stream Holy Week services due to lockdown,"Picture for representational purpose only.

MUMBAI: For the first time in living memory, the Christian community is unable to attend church over Holy Week owing to the coronavirus lockdown. Not just the archdiocese of Bombay but also individual churches are reaching out to their parishioners by broadcasting masses and rituals through their own YouTube channels, and living streaming on their web sites and apps.

The spiritual cleansing of Lent enters its final week at Palm Sunday today. Easter Sunday falls April 12.

Palm Sunday marks the start of Holy Week, the most significant seven days on the Christian calendar. Maundy Thursday sees the washing of the feet ceremony by priests while special masses and vast processions unfold at Good Friday. In fact even those members of the community who are unable to visit church throughout the year make sure to attend Good Friday and Easter mass.

However, the landscape is virtually altered this season. The archbishop of Bombay, Oswald Cardinal Gracias , will broadcast all services including Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter on the YouTube channel of the archdiocese.

Churches citywide are following his live streaming since the lockdown. ""We shall do the same for the Holy Week,"" said Daniel Lobo , a parishioner of RC Church Colaba .

Fr Frazer Mascarenhas SJ, parish priest of St Peter's Bandra, said, ""Not being able to gather is painful, but it is an opportunity for us to keep the balance between religious activities at home and in church. Our parish will live stream the religious ceremonies this week, which will be conducted by only three or four priests in the church at the usual times. We encourage our people to make these into special family events by praying together.""

Fr Vincent Vaz of Holy Family Chakala said, ""On Maundy Thursday we will stream a special mass for the sick where during the symbolic ritual of washing of the feet we will pray for the coronavirus victims, caregivers and civic authorities. That the Lord may wash away the illness and the pain.""

Rev. Bharat Solanki of the Centenary Methodist Gujarati Church, Grant Road, said, ""We have recorded the worship service which will be uploaded on Whatsapp on Palm Sunday, Passion Week, Good Friday and Easter.""

Activist Joseph Dias whose organisation CSF organises the grand Good Friday procession in Kalina-Vakola, said, ""It will be for the first time in over 32 years that it is not possible to enact the Stations of the Cross live on Good Friday. But I have put up a YouTube channel since we are unable to do so. We have uploaded scenes from the earlier years. We are also releasing the regular musical version of this, universally the most popular devotion, before Good Friday.""

Roshan D'Souza, an active parishioner of Holy Family, said, ""The lockdown has given new meaning to this season. We have had to sacrifice going out on our outreaches, services in church and other activities. But it has also shown us new ways to move closer to God. Spending more time with our families, reaching out to our neighbours in need, learning to live frugally. (Just like) Jesus' resurrection was not possible without the Cross, there is no Easter without Good Friday. This (trial) too shall pass.""

NAGPUR: A majority of people think that 50 to 80 per cent of coronavirus-related information or news appearing on social media is 'fake', according to a survey.Amid the lockdown, a number of people have been relying on e-papers to keep themselves updated, said the survey conducted from March 28 to April 4 among nearly 1,200 people by the Mass Communication department of Nagpur's Rashtrasant Tukoji Maharaj University.The respondents included students, government and private employees, businessmen, professionals and home-makers.""To a question on fake news, 39.1 per cent respondents said 50 to 80 per cent of information on social media was false. About 10.8 per cent felt over 80 per cent information on social media was fake,"" said Dr Moiz Mannan Haque, the mass communication department head who led the study.It becomes clear that people are aware of the presence of fake news, but a disproportionately large number still said they get their information from social media, he pointed out.To a question on how they found out that a particular news item or post was false, 36.5 per cent respondents said they knew this after they saw an official clarification or correction by a government source, he informed.""This proves that the proactive communication by health, police, local administration and other government sources does have a positive effect,"" Haque said.On whether the media was 'overplaying' the pandemic at the cost of other important news, 34.9 per cent respondents chose to remain neutral. However, 32.7 per cent chose the 'strongly agree' and 'agree' options for this, while 32.3 per cent chose the 'other way round' option.""So, opinions are quite equally divided on this count. At a time when a large number of people are consuming mass media content, it becomes important to understand the users perceptions. If people do not attach credibility and veracity to a particular source, it becomes difficult to mobilise them for safety and precaution, he said.During the lockdown, the use of digital news media went up by 5.8 per cent and television viewership as the main source of news consumption went up by a little over eight per cent, he said.""One must realise here that for a period of time, hard copies of newspapers were not available.

CHENNAI: Clarifying that work from home does not mean employees can go to their home towns, the Madras high court has directed 168 employees of Tamil Nadu Grama Bank to rejoin work immediately. They had all gone to their home towns in different parts of the state after the nationwide lockdown came into effect last month.

Pointing out that the bank has commenced work and has to distribute cash doles to beneficiaries, Justice K Ravichandrabaabu directed the employees attached to Tamil Nadu Grama Bank of Salem district to approach the nodal officer concerned in their respective native place and make arrangements to work from the nearest grama bank immediately. If such permission is denied, they have to approach the authority concerned to get a pass to travel to Salem immediately. The Tamil Nadu Grama Bank Workers Union moved the HC challenging the March 31 circular issued by the general manager, Tamil Nadu Grama Bank, Salem.

On March 23, in view of the lockdown, a circular was issued to run the bank with 50% staff. The others were asked to work from home on rotation.

MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is facing a piquant situation after the postponement of the legislative council election, which he needs to win before May 28 to keep his chair.

In view of the spread of the coronavirus, the Election Commission of India (ECI) on Saturday postponed the April-end polls to the nine seats of the upper house to be voted on by members of the legislative assembly. A similar decision was taken for Bihar.

Thackeray, who is not a member of either house of the legislature, was sworn in as chief minister on November 28. The law stipulates that he must become a member of the house within six months.

A bureaucrat said there were still two options before Thackeray. First, governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari could make him a nominated member of the council. Two seats from the governor's quota are vacant following the resignation of Ramrao Wadkule and Rahul Narvekar after they won the assembly polls.

If the governor agrees to such a proposal, Thackeray's tenure will be for two months only, till June. After that, he will have to again be nominated or elected.

The second option is to resign on November 28 and immediately take oath again to continue in the chair for six months more. If Thackeray does so, the entire cabinet will have to take oath anew.

200,['5/04/2020'],"ONGC's SOS to govt: Cut cess, royalty, free gas price to help company survive","NEW DELHI: India's top oil and gas producer ONGC has sent an SOS to the government seeking a cut in taxes as well as being granted pricing and marketing freedom for gas to help it weather the slump in prices that has made sustaining operations difficult and may force a cut in investments.The slump in international oil prices to low-20s ($/barrel) and natural gas prices falling to a decade low of $2.39 per million British thermal unit is threatening to push the company into making cash-losses on a monthly basis, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.While the gas price is way below the cost of production, high tax incidence is resulting in cash losses even on crude oil output.State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) last month wrote to the government seeking abolition of oil cess if price realised by producers is less than $ 45 per barrel. Also, it wants the 20 per cent of price paid as royalty to state governments be halved.Currently, the government levies 20% ad-valorem cess on the price that producers get. Also, ONGC/OIL are required to pay 20 per cent royalty on the price of crude oil it extracts from onland oil blocks to the state governments.Sources said ONGC wants the formula of pricing domestically produced natural gas at rates prevalent in gas-surplus nations such as US and Russia. The rates using the formula came to $2.39 per million British thermal unit from April.This price is the lowest that the company will realise since 2010 when the government had moved towards deregulating gas pricing.In May 2010, the Cabinet had approved an Oil Ministry proposal to raise the rate of gas sold to power and fertilizer firms from $ 1.79 per mmBtu to $4.20.ONGC and OIL got $3.818 per mmBtu price for the gas they produced from fields given to them on nomination basis and after adding 10 per cent royalty, the fuel cost $4.20 per mmBtu for consumers.The Congress-led UPA had approved a new pricing formula for implementation in 2014 that would have raised the rates but the BJP-led government scrapped it and brought a new formula.The BJP-led government had in October 2014 adopted a formula that takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (UK), Alberta (Canada) and Russia with a lag of one-quarter. Prices are set every six months -- on April 1 and October 1 each year.Sources said OID cess, which has increased from $3 to $13 over the years, is causing a lot of stress on current and new oil and gas projects.OID Cess is levied on crude oil produced as excise duty under the Oil Industries (Development) Act of 1974. The cess is being levied on crude oil from nominated blocks and pre-NELP exploratory blocks only.The OID cess was raised from Rs 2,500 per tonne to Rs 4,500 per tonne in March 2012. The price of the Indian basket of crude oil stood at around USD 110 per barrel then.With the fall in global crude oil prices in mid-2014, companies asked for reducing the levy and converting it into 8-10 per cent ad-valorem. The government had changed the levy of the cess to 20 per cent ad-valorem in March 2016.Sources said ONGC has communicated to the government that the current rate of taxes is threatening to push the firm into cash losses and will impact its planned capex.Unless profits are made, future investments are at a risk, they said, adding ONGC fields are old and past their prime and it would be a ""big, big mistake"" to believe they would behave as they did a decade back without investments in pulling up recovery rates.Sources said cutting the cess rate will make over 200 million barrel of oil equivalent of production viable at the entire industry level.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74990335,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-68436,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ongcs-sos-to-govt-cut-cess-royalty-free-gas-price-to-help-company-survive/articleshow/74990330.cms

""I immediately shifted. I have been here for the past seven days and am having a good time watching my favourite films and catching up on some great innings of Sachin, Sourav and Dravid on Youtube,"" he said.The owner of the hotel, a 3-star facility, pointed out that it is offering breakfast, lunch and dinner to the guests as part of the isolation package. ""Those who are in self isolation are given single rooms with facilities like cable TV, AC and toilet, along with connectivity to Amazon, Hotstar and other entertainment apps. We are offering both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food with Indian and Chinese options,"" he added.According to the owner, the quarantine guests are not allowed to get out of their rooms.

Her mom almost had a panic attack! “Where are you going? The country’s under lockdown!” She breathed a sigh of relief when she saw her daughter calmly switch on her laptop, sharp at 8.30 pm, and raise a toast with four of her friends in different cities, all ready for a video party. All dressed up. All in red lipstick.“Last Saturday, it was red lipstick. Next Saturday, it’s going to be an LBD video party,” she says, adding, “I don’t know why we are calling it social distancing. It’s more physical distancing – socially, we are making an extra effort to catch up every day. This video party was planned this morning when we all decided it’s time to lift our spirits. With technology on our side, we can shake this overwhelming feeling of gloom and doom.”It’s happening all over the world. People are catching up with long-lost school friends, calling their parents more often, playing cards and other games with colleagues after work hours, and celebrating birthdays, anniversaries – all over video parties.Sanghamitra Mukherjee, talent acquisition partner, AIA Group office in Hong Kong, caught up with her school friend through a long video chat a few days ago. They were all connected on a WhatsApp ‘school group’. But where was the time to have one-on-one conversations in a group? “As bad as the situation is right now, I finally had the time to catch up. What I realised was that we could have done this a million times before if only our minds weren’t as cluttered as they usually are.”It’s not as if this lockdown has made her stress-free, but it did give Mukherjee the much-needed break from the robotic life that we are all accustomed to. “This video call made me feel my friend was right beside me. And it helped me understand that this is our battle, together. No one is alone. We are fighting it collectively. A sense of calm came over me after the chat. I felt safe.”Dr Samir Parikh, psychiatrist, puts things in perspective when he says, “The whole world is collectively helping one another through self-quarantine. If anything, this pandemic is teaching us every day that we are all interdependent. Coronavirus spread through the world because we are all interdependent; and it’s through this same interdependence — staying connected while maintaining physical distance — that we can all heal.”IshaKapur, who runs a business in interior decoration, parties with her friends through Houseparty (video app). “It’s not just partying or playing games with friends; I’m looking forward to my online pilates class at 5 pm this evening. Maintaining our everyday routine keeps us grounded.” Sumer Vikram Singh, petroleum engineer with Halliburton Offshore Services, is using this time to connect with long-lost friends, and have “deep conversations”, something he didn’t have the time for earlier. “I just hope this new habit becomes sustainable. We must rethink everything about our lives,” he says.Dr Parikh concurs. “The whole world is off the roller-coaster of life it had gotten used to. We all have this void – it’s not a bad thing. Rather a perfect opportunity to get acquainted with our own feelings. We are realising just how much we need other people for our own wellbeing.”Pranav Juneja, who owns a family business, got to understand the immense joy of connecting people when he taught his 60+ grandparents how to play Tambola on Zoom (video app) with their friends! “It was so heartening to see them enjoying themselves. I think we are all slowly understanding that simple things, like connecting with old friends, seeing our loved ones happy, go a long way in keeping us anxiety-free. Even when all this is over, we must develop this as a habit.”For PayPal executive DeepaliButalia, the video chats are a great way to keep her mind sharp while playing knowledge-based games. “For our age group (20-30 years), video-based parties and knowledge-based games have become the saviour.” Though she warns, “It’s only fun if you’re not doing this 24x7, staying awake at night. Slot time on weekends for parties, and play games with whoever is free after work-hours for an hour. Don’t get addicted,” she advises.This pandemic is teaching us every day that we are all interdependent.

Swaraag, a folk-fusion band have actually set an example with their recent song. They created a number related to the ongoing #CoronaScare like quite a few other musicians but what sets them apart is the fact that it has all been done from home and is a great example of #WorkFromHome. While a few members of the band filmed the song at home, sitting on one’s bed, the rest pitch in digitally.

The band comprising Pratap Singh (Founder/Team Coach), Arif Khan (Zitar player), Asif Khan (Lead Singer), Tasruf Ali (Saxophone), Rishab Rozar (Guitar), Arif Khan (Khartal/Morchang player), Sajid Khan (Drummer) and Seif Ali Khan (Tabla PLayer), bring forth the best of the traditional Rajasthani music amalgamated with modern instruments to create a mellifluous experience for the audience. The song, ‘Ja Ja Re Corona Virus’ has a distinct Rajasthani folk touch to it.

Pratap says, “Before the 21-day lockdown we had been travelling extensively all across the country for shows and post lockdown our life changed drastically. But we thought, what better way to be in touch with your music than making a new song with a message in it? And that is just what we did.

209,['5/04/2020'],What you wear affects your work output,"Now that the world is looking at a work-from-home (WFH) life, editorials are flying fast with tips and to-dos to ace the at-home work life. There are many who question the very point of dressing up for work when your office is your dining table. And then again, should you care for style in the middle of a pandemic? Yes. Many style advisories talk about not giving up panache in lieu of panic. Veronica Dodson in a theladders.com article said: “If we aren’t dressed to face the world, there’s little chance that we can actually face the reality of work.” The bottom line: what you see in the mirror matters.The WFH life is a constant challenge to stay motivated. The novelty of working in your PJs wears out quickly. Without actually dressing up for work, you no longer have these cues to condition your brain into understanding when work ends and home begins.The key is to think even though you work from home, you are at work. Dressing professionally allows you to control your attitude, and you signal to family or flatmates that you are working. In fact, when you work in isolation it’s all the more important to look professional. One key reason is that you mostly interact with your computer and through phones, which studies prove can lead to a feeling of disconnectedness. Wearing professional clothes keeps you grounded in reality.l Stylish sweatpants that you can lounge in but also Instagram itl A nice pair of sneakers are trigger enough to your mind that you are in work model Keep a crisp professional shirt nearby for video consl Wear a funky T-shirt and not your ratty ol’ gharka teel Sliders, not slippersl Wear light jewellery or a watch to feel put together",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74990479,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-707632/74990479.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/style-guide/what-you-wear-affects-your-work-output/articleshow/74990479.cms

213,['5/04/2020'],Markaz member from Nagpur tests positive for Covid-19 in Chhattisgarh,"RAIPUR: A 16-year old Markaz member from Nagpur tested positive for Covid-19 in Chhattisgarh’s Korba district on Saturday, sending health officials scrambling to find how he caught the virus when he hadn’t travelled to Delhi.The boy hails from Kamptee area, about 20km from Nagpur, and was staying in Katghora town of Korba for past month, says sources. Now, there are six active Covid-19 cases in Chhattisgarh till Saturday.“The teenage is a Markaz member, who came to Chhattisgarh from Nagpur in the first week of March. He was in a group of 16 people from Maharashtra. We are tracing his travel details but as of now there is no record of him visiting Delhi in the past month,” said Korba Collector Kiran Kaushal.Last month, Korba administration learnt that two religious groups, of 14 and 16 members, had come to the state from Maharashtra, which was then already topping the Covid-19 chart. One group arrived on February 25 and the other in the March. The teenage, the only minor, was in the second group.Since they had come from a corona hotspot, the Korba administration in mid March ordered them to remain in home isolation, say officials. They stayed put in two mosques in Katghora town, said a Korba official.Last week, when scores of attendees of the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi turned out Covid-positive and the Centre alerted states, Chhattisgarh administration identified 101 people who had returned from the Delhi congregation in Nizamuddin Markaz. Hence, the Korba administration isolated these two mosques immediately. Though these 30 people were not on the government’s list of 101, they were isolated separately on the possibility of their being primary contacts of Covid-19 suspects from Korba.All of them were tested for Covid-19 and the minor was the only one positive. He has been admitted to AIIMS-Raipur.However, Korba collector Kiran Kaushal said that the identified 17 people of Korba, those who had returned from Nizamuddin’s Tablighi Jamaat are still in quarantine centre and their Covid-19 sample test report is awaited.Talking to TOI, Korba SP Abhishek Meena said, “It is yet to be confirmed if these 30 people came in contact with Korba residents, who have returned from Tablighi Jammat in Delhi. The teenager hails from Kamptee police station area near Nagpur and as he is in quarantine for Covid-19 treatment, the police investigation has to follow medical norms of distancing. Hence, we are yet to ascertain his family background and other information.""The 16-year old is the second corona case from Korba, the SP said, adding that this group had not attended the Tablighi Jamaat in Nizumuddin between march 12 and 15.",raipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74990510,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-188052,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/markaaz-member-from-nagpur-tests-positive-for-covid-19-in-chhattisgarh/articleshow/74990511.cms

NEW DELHI: As per data released by the Union health ministry on Sunday morning, India reported 3,374 cases of Covid-19 with 77 deaths. The ministry reported two new fatalities -one each from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu on Sunday. Meanwhile, the United States of America with over three lakh patients now has the highest number of cases in the world and Italy had the highest number of deaths with over 13,000 fatalities.Here are the top development from India and the world:With the Chief Medical Officer of the Central Reserve Police Forces (CRPF) testing positive for coronavirus, DG CRPF AP Maheshwari, who came into indirect contact with him through an official, has given his sample for COVID-19 testing. While 20 senior officers of the security force have been placed under home quarantine. Apart from the DG, several senior CRPF officials have also given their samples for testing, sources in CRPF said. Almost 20 CRPF officers are under home quarantine since the last couple of days as a precautionary measure.Maharashtra has reported the most coronavirus deaths at 24, followed by Gujarat (10) and Telangana (7). Number of fatalities from other states are: Madhya Pradesh (6); Delhi (6); Punjab (5); Karnataka (4); West Bengal (3) Tamil Nadu (3); Jammu and Kashmir (2); Uttar Pradesh (2); Kerala (2); Andhra Pradesh(1); Bihar (1); Himachal Pradesh (1).The highest number of confirmed cases was reported from Maharashtra at 490, followed by Tamil Nadu at 485 and Delhi 445. While the number of active COVID-19 cases stood at 3,030, as many as 266 people were cured of the disease and one had migrated. Tally of positive cases from other states as per health ministry data are: Kerala (306); Telangana (269); Uttar Pradesh (227); Rajasthan (200); Andhra Pradesh (161); Karnataka (144); Gujarat (105); Madhya Pradesh (104); Jammu and Kashmir (92); West Bengal (69); Punjab (57); Haryana (49); Bihar (30); Assam (24); Uttarakhand (22); Odisha (20); Chandigarh (18); Ladakh (14); Andaman and Nicobar Islands (10); Chhattisgarh (9); Goa (7); Himachal Pradesh (6); Puducherry (5); Jharkhand (2); Manipur (2); Mizoram (1) and Arunachal Pradesh (1).PM Modi has reminded people to light up lamps on Sunday night to show the country's collective resolve to fight coronavirus. ""#9pm9minute"", the prime minister tweeted to remind people of the exercise. Modi had on Friday urged people to switch off the lights at their homes and light up lamps, candles or mobile phone torches for nine minutes at 9 pm on April 5 to display the country's ""collective resolve"" to defeat coronavirus.On Friday Canada’s PM Justin Trudeau announced he would pay $2,000 every month for four months to those who have lost their incomes. Earlier US president Donald Trump had announced a similar support program for those hit hardest by the Covid-19 crisis. These initiatives seem to have been inspired by Indian use of cash transfer schemes to benefit people during Covid-19 crisis. On March 26, the Modi government had announced a set of cash transfer and related benefits that would use the JAM (JanDhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) backbone to move over Rs 30,000 crore into woman JanDhan account holders and over Rs 5,000 crore into linked LPG connections.Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal has said that around 30% of all Covid-19 cases in India are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation that was held last month in the Nizamuddin markaz. As many as 1,023 Covid-19 positive cases found in 17 states have been traced to the Jamaat event which now accounts for 30% of all cases in India.The DRDO on Saturday said it has developed a portable full-body decontamination chamber or personnel sanitization enclosure (PSE), which can be used in hospitals, office buildings and other critical installations. On entering the chamber, electrically-operated pumps create a disinfectant mist of hypo sodium chloride which is calibrated for an operation of 25 seconds. With 700-litre tank capacity, the PSE can be used by 650 people until the refill is required.US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a telephonic discussion on Saturday. As per White House readout of the conversation, both leaders have agreed to ensure smooth functioning of the global supply chains for critical pharmaceuticals and medical goods to fight the coronavirus pandemic and discussed the significance of Yoga and Ayurveda for the physical and mental well-being of people during the major global health crisis.President Donald Trump warned Saturday that the country could be headed into its ""toughest"" weeks yet as the coronavirus death toll mounts. ""There will be a lot of death, unfortunately,"" Trump said in a somber start to his daily briefing on the pandemic.The overall number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Spain has increased to 126,168, overtaking Italy's tally of 124,632, making it the worst-affected European nation in terms of infections. The tally placed Spain first in Europe and second only to the US worldwide in terms of confirmed cases. The US was currently the highest with a total of 312,076 cases, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at the Washington-based Johns Hopkins University. The CSSE update showed that Italy had the highest number of deaths in the world at 15,362, followed by Spain in the second place with 11,947 fatalities.The number of coronavirus cases in Pakistan might be over 50,000 by the end of April — 2,392 critical patients needing intensive care, 7,024 serious patients and 41,482 others who would have mild symptoms and just require isolation at their homes, the Supreme Court was informed. In a report submitted to the apex court on Saturday, the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination (NHSRC), however, explained that these figures were mere projections based on assumptions made from trends of the outbreak in other countries.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74990749,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-994216,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-latest-updates-indias-cash-transfer-scheme-inspires-other-countries/articleshow/74990175.cms
216,['5/04/2020'],Learn the art of Kakeibo,"The Japanese have had a long tradition of being mindful about their spending habits. They call it Kakeibo, which literally translates to ‘the art of budgeting manually’. The time couldn’t be more apt to adopt this philosophy. While self-quarantining, we also have to be mindful of where our money is going, and how much of it is being debited from our banks. It’s quite easy to get carried away stocking essentials — since a lot of buying is being done online — and then suddenly realising that our account has dipped unusually low without us being aware of it.The philosophy of Kakeibo encourages you to look to the future, focus on the present, and reflect on the past, with plenty of wisdom and motivation sprinkled along the way. This particular form of financial management makes it a lot easier to manage your daily expenses than your average Excel doc.At the core of Kakeibo are four vital questions that you must ask yourself:1) How much money is available? 2) How much are you spending?3) How much do you have to save?4) How can you improve your budgeting process?The fourth point is the reason why Kakeibo is most essential to us now. You have to be aware — on a daily basis — about how much money is going out of your kitty; and since that’s not completely in your control these days (with lockdown), going through your daily expenses with a pen and paper is only going to help you plan for the next few months.One of the best outcomes of adopting Kakeibo is that it makes us introspect and reflect on our spending habits and eventually, reach both short and long-term goals.Business coach Jasmin Waldmann adds another huge benefit of manual accounting: emotional security. She says, “If you are in control of your money and financial life, you get a lot of peace. Especially in our times, when the world is uncertain.” A huge part of wellness, after all, is about being money ‘wise’ and sensible.l Writing in longhand slows down our thought processand increases present-moment awareness.l The sequential hand movements involved in handwriting, integrates and activates parts of the brain that include memory, language, and cognitive power.l Writing your goals by hand increases motivation and accountability.Like all other fears, financial anxiety has risen manifold in the last month. Manual journaling is a simple way for all of us to be extra mindful of our spending habits so that we can reward ourselves with bettersavings— DrSaloni Singh, psychologistKakeibo is credited to the first woman journalist of Japan, Hani Motoko, who published one of the first women’s magazines named Fujin No Tomo (women’s friend), in 1908",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74990523,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-744064/74990523.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/learn-the-art-of-kakeibo/articleshow/74990523.cms

Ahmedabad reported eight of the cases – all suspected to have direct or indirect connection with the Markaz event at Nizamuddin in Delhi, said state health department officials.Gujarat also recorded one more death, taking the total death count to 11.Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health & family welfare), said that the 61-year-old woman, who succumbed to the Covid-19 infection at Mission Hospital in Surat, had earlier come to the same hospital on March 28. “The doctors had recommended her immediate hospitalization. However, she refused. She was brought back on April 4 in critical condition where chances of her survival were slim,” she said.“We urge all to pay heed to the medical advice – come forward if you have any symptoms associated with Covid-19 coupled with domestic or international travel history or contact with any known Covid-19 positive person. It would not only save you but the community at large,” added Ravi.Out of 14 new cases, 8 are recorded from Ahmedabad, followed by two each from Surat and Bhavnagar and one each from Vadodara and Chhota Udepur. The tribal district in eastern belt of Gujarat has recorded the first case, said health department officials.Ravi said that all eight cases from Ahmedabad are directly or indirectly associated with the Markaz at Nizamuddin, Delhi. “Active contact tracing and identification of all the persons who have returned from Markaz is being done in Gujarat in association with state police. We have appealed to the community to provide all details for quicker identification and treatment of possible Covid-19 cases,” she said.The health department officials said that out of eight, five persons have travel history to Delhi.

220,['5/04/2020'],Times Kitchen Tales 2: Could baingan ka bharta be our elusive national dish?,"What is the national dish of India? Butter chicken – the omnipresent dish in ‘Indian restaurants’? There was a strong argument in favour of khichdi. Kitchens across India have versions of it, even if called by other names – bisibelebhaat in Karnataka for example. In Bengal, khichuri evokes memories of the cherished Durga Puja ashtamirbhog. In Gujarat, it is often the last main course of a soul-satisfying thali. For some, it is to be eaten when unwell with no associated joy.Is khichuri too simple a dish? How about biryani? It is found in restaurant menus across the country. Put five biryanis from different parts of the country — say Hyderabadi, Awadhi from Kolkata, Irani from Mumbai, Thalassery from Kerala and Dindigul from Tamil Nadu — and you’ll see that each looks and tastes different. National dish still?Some of the dishes known as ‘biryani’ today, are not even biryanis, some say. The donne biryani of Bengaluru for example. Or the biryani of Lucknow! The term ‘biryani’ was used for these pulaos to make them sound more catchy commercially. Just as ‘risotto’ is used for rice- based dishes in modern Indian bistros today.What about the dosa? The Shettys of Mangalore-run Udupi joints have made the dosa ubiquitous. The most popular breakfast option in Jamshedpur. You will see more people chomping on dosas than on cholebhatures in the sweet shops of New Delhi, such as Nathu’s or Evergreen Sweets. The dosa has variations in texture (thick, crunchy benne dosa of Bengaluru), or composition (green moong pesarattu of Andhra or ragidosa of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu), but it is the Udupi restaurant one which is the cookie cutter option... till Mumbai happened and the Gujaratis took over. The Sai SwadDosa cart at Mumbai’s Ghatkopar offers more than 40 varieties of dosas; jini (no onion garlic, with vegetables shredded and blended with crumbled paneer and green chutney), Manchurian pasta and chocolate cheese, for example.One could make a strong case for the puri. Most parts of India have versions of this puffed-up fried bread. The combination to have it with varies too. The maida-based luchi with chholar dal of Bengal, that my grandma makes, is my favourite.What about the baingan kabharta as our national dish? Surprised? Unlike the poster boy of vegetables, the potato, aubergines are indigenous to India. Versions of smoked aubergine dishes are found everywhere. Ringda no odo/olo of Gujarat, vangyachebharit of Maharashtra (regional variations include crushed peanuts added in Khandesh, grated coconut with dahi/tomato in Malvan). Begun pora of Bengal, bengenapoorapitika of Assam, baingan chokha of Bihar and baingan bhorta of Odisha.Badanekayipalya in Karnataka (with special, round mattugullaaubergines in the coast, coconut and not mustard oil is used here). Tamarind chutney, green chillies and coriander paste is added to the vankayabhaaji of Andhra. In Tamil Nadu, smoked aubergine is called suttakathirikkai, and is more of a chutney on the side or as a base for raita.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Yuvraj Singh has said that Rohit Sharma reminded him of Pakistan batting legend Inzamam-ul-Haq in his early days.

The flamboyant India vice-captain made his ODI debut in June 2007 while his maiden T20 game came during the World Cup later that year against England, where unfortunately Rohit didn't get a chance to bat.

Asked about his first impression of Rohit, Yuvraj said the swashbuckling batsman seemed like somebody who had a lot of time to play his strokes.

""I think when he came into the Indian team, he looked like somebody who had a lot of time,"" Yuvraj Singh said during a YouTube chat show.

""He reminded me of Inzamam-ul-Haq, because, when he batted, Inzi had a lot of time (to play the bowlers),""

Inzamam, a veteran of 120 Tests and over 300 One-day Internationals, is known to remain calm under pressure situations. He captained Pakistan from 2003-07.

227,['5/04/2020'],8 ways to add that summer pop to your home,"April has kicked in, and all of us are on an involuntary “summer holiday” if I may, trapped in our homes due to the COVID-19 lockdown. It is infuriating, and it can cause a ton of boredom because none of us is used to spending so much time in our own homes. But let’s try looking at bright(er) side, i.e what we can achieve from spending all this time at home. We’ve all been putting off those home renovations and redecorations since years, claiming that “we will do it when the time is right”. Guess what? The time is now even though it may not seem right. Spend this time observing the aspects of your home that you want to change and researching ways to spruce them up. Bright colours, breezy interiors, and playful accents are all that it's about. And summertime is the best time and excuse to upgrade your home and change it up.A few tips and tricks to help you make your decisions!1. Natural Appeal - A simple paint job is a cost-effective method to change up the look of your interiors. Neutral colours and warm tones are the epitome of summer, and you can mix it up with different patterns using paint stencils to add some pattern. Wallpapers are also making a comeback, so go for some natural prints like floral patterns and leafy structures. You can combine this with indoor flowers or plants to give an organic appeal that screams summer. Natural elements are the easiest way to give your home the perfect summer vibe.2. Colour, Colour, and more Colour! - Summer is all about joy, and the easiest way to create a cheery atmosphere at home is by adding some bold hues. You can do this by adding pops of colour with colourful accents or go for floral arrangements in colourful vases. You can also look at giving your home a nautical vibe by adding some calm and cool blue tones in the form of collectables. Add some colour in a larger aspect by painting one single wall a bright colour like fuchsia pink or turquoise blue, and balance it out with neutral curtains or interiors like your couch and cushions. Yellow is another colour which represents summer due to its warm hue, so go for a yellow wall or yellow interiors mixed with indoor plants.3. Go for some intriguing summerscents- Redecorating your home doesn’t necessarily have to be confined to just the visuals. Impart some tropical summery scents with the perfect scented candle, or you can even make your own! Summer is all about freshness and rejuvenation, so scents like lemon, cucumber, and oceany scents would create the perfect summer vibe and add to a calming atmosphere.4. Let’s swap the seating? Yes, please! While spending time at home, some good company and laughs would make the perfect summer day. Make your home more inviting by creating an oh-so-appealing seating area that your guests would never want to leave. You can do this by incorporating colourful floor cushions, which add a homely albeit fun element to your space. Floor cushions would have to be paired with low seating tables, which would be the perfect space for a fun game night.5. Create the Perfect Bar - During a heatwave, all we need is some cool cocktails or fresh lemonade to calm our body down and kick back after a tiresome day. When we think of summer, all that comes to mind is fruity cocktails and bite some titbits, which deserve a special station on their own. Create the perfect impromptu bar, stocked up with your favourite drinks and paired with fun elements such as colourful paper umbrellas and funky stirrers.6. Make Way For Some Light - To add summer vibes, you don’t necessarily have to redecorate. Add some light to your home by leaving the windows open, pulling back the curtains, and simply getting rid of gloomy and dark furniture. Add some more mirrors for the light to reflect, and give a sense of openness. Light, see-through curtains are also enough to let the light in, and they also keep out the mosquitos, which is just an added bonus!7. Add A Touch Of Art - Go for simple affordable colourful pieces throughout your home, which add a balance of texture and colour on its own. You can also frame your vacation or family pictures, which give a sense of peace every time you take a look at it. Another option is framing simple motivational quotes, which can easily lift your mood whenever you’re feeling down. Art pieces can balance the colour of a room when paired up with darker walls. Again, summer is all about colour!Inputs by Krsnaa Mehta, Founder and Executive Director, India Circus.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74990640,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-61215/74990640.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/8-ways-to-add-that-summer-pop-to-your-home/articleshow/74990640.cms

KOLKATA: Mahesh Agarwal, the owner of Haldiram Bhujiyawala (Pratik Food Products), died in Singapore on Friday, a little past midnight (as per IST). He was suffering from critical liver ailment and was undergoing treatment at a hospital there for three months. Agarwal was to turn 57 on Saturday.

Given the current circumstances, the distraught family had to agree to the cremation of the body there on Friday itself, following rules of that country, that do not follow the Hindu cremation system. Agarwal's bereaved wife Meena and daughter Avni, who had been with him through this time, are desperate to return home but are finding it impossible to do so in the current situation.

The mother and daughter duo has tried to reach out to the embassy by filling out a form online that all Indians stuck in Singapore are doing. The country is supposed to go in for a lockdown from Tuesday and as per the news that Meena and Avni have been able to gather, Indians have been told that a flight would be organised to bring them back to Delhi in the wee hours of Wednesday, for which there is a scramble.

""We couldn't save father but the business back in Kolkata has suddenly been left orphaned and we have to go back to save it..."" said Avni from Singapore. Agarwal has a son and three daughters. Eldest son Pratik is in Kolkata, elder daughter Anchal is a scientist and works with Sandisk in San Francisco, while younger daughter Antara is studying maths and computer science at Durham University. Agarwal had a critical liver ailment and was flown in to Singapore in January where the family was assured of a transplant. The surgery was successful but he had developed an infection after he was shifted from the ICU to high dependency unit.

""The infection generated from candida auris, according to the papers we have received from the hospital,"" Avni said.

The family was told that since Agarwal died of an infection, no risk could be taken about his last rites; the body would be sealed in a plastic bag along with the tracheostomy tubes that he was carrying and put inside an electric incinerator. ""We had to agree...it was so heart breaking to see him go that way... but we were helpless,"" Avni added. The ashes have been stored separately and the family will be allowed to take the urn at the time of leaving the country. ""We hear that no flights/trains are operating till April 15. How to reach Kolkata ...we are writing to all our relatives to connect with ministers, bureaucrats both at the Centre and in the state,"" Avni said.

Kolkata: Last Sunday, actor Rudranil Ghosh wrote a poignant poem on how the fate of a widow about to be sent to an old-age home changed once the lockdown was announced. He named it ‘Coronar Ma’ and posted a video of his recitation. A week later, this video has already been shared 26,313 times. That easily overtook the 7,461 views of BBC Radio’s YouTube recording of Irish priest Brother Richard Hendrick viral poem ‘Lockdown’ that was shared on March 21.Welcome to the times of poetry-reading during lockdown. From kids to veterans, reading of all kinds of verse on social media is giving a breathing space, providing a chance to escape the claustrophobic times of global uncertainty and distress. “Poetry is giving some relief. It’s healing. When I see such response, I feel I’ve been able to discharge my responsibility as an artiste,” the actor said.According to Joie Bose, founder of Poetry Paradigm , the organization had started the process of encouraging people to post their videos since March. “We kickstarted it with Ruskin Bond reading for us. Poetry-reading gives you solace and when you are making videos of yourself reading to connect with people, it breaks the sense of loneliness that lockdown brings. Hence, at Poetry Paradigm, we have encouraged people to post their videos on our page. We kickstarted it with Ruskin Bond reading for us. We have got more than 159 videos. To encourage people further, we are collaborating with Oxford Bookstore. Nine-year-old Devansh and Tiana will also be with me,” Bose said.On his Facebook page, poet Prabal Kumar Basu has uploaded excerpts from his poetry-reading session and included those verses that are relevant now. “Poetry always strengthens one's inner soul. When people are in isolation and not able to see or meet their dear ones, they find respite in poetry or music. A poet reading his own poems carries an added advantage. People find their strength which heals the agony and stress during times of lockdown. That’s how a poet contributes to society,“ Basu said.While amateurs are engaging in random readings, those like actor-director Aparna Sen have a purpose. In her first video, Sen said: “This morning, I thought I would read a poem borrowing a page from my friend Shabana Azmi’s book. I could read a Bengali poem or an English poem. Or I could read a translation of a Bengali poem because there are many poets in Bengal who deserve to be known all over the world.” So, one after the other, she recited Jibanananda Das’ ‘Loghu muhuurto’ and its English translation by her father Chidananda Dasgupta, along with the English translation of Das’ ‘Banalata Sen’, ‘In the likeness of the Sun’, ‘The Cat’ and ‘The Snake’. On other days, she read the originals and her own English translations of Shakti Chattopadhyay’s ‘Shey bawro shukher shomoy noy, shey bawro anonder shomoy noy’ and Joy Goswami’s ‘Greehobodhur Diary’. She also read out William Blake’s ‘The Lamb’ and ‘The Tyger’.For director Ranjan Ghosh , this format is interesting since the poems reach those who do not speak Bangla. “Besides, her recitation is very modern and contemporary, and is capable of making the poems resonate within us. That is the hallmark of good recitation,” he said. Inspired by these sessions, Ghosh himself did a maiden poetry-reading session on Saturday evening. “I chose William Wordworth’s ‘I wondered lonely as a Cloud' and Tagore’s 'Praan'. The emotions these poems convey seemed very relevant in today's context,” he said.On Thursday, which also happened to be the 118th birth anniversary of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, interdisciplinary artiste Sujoy Prasad Chatterjee read out a poem dedicated to the legend by Purnendu Patri. “Inspired by Kumar Mukherjee, a torchbearer of the Kasur Patiala Gharana, I thought of a humble tribute to this icon. Apart from others, this video was also shared by famous radio artiste Srabanti Mazumdar. She also narrated her own association with the legend,” Chatterjee said. This recitation was for a video shot by Arka Goswami and had rare black-and-white photos. In the audioscape, one can hear strains of the thumri ‘Ab toh jaane nahin doongi’ that’s punctuated by Chatterjee reciting ‘Fuler gondhe photaar jonne/Naarir sporsho pabaar jonne/Ghumer moddhe kandte kandte/Aamra jedin jubok holaam/Baaire tokhon bokkhe brikkhe, jole sthole ontoreekkhe/Aamader shei kanna niye gaan gaaiche Bade Golam…’But what will happen to this habit of reading poetry online once the quarantine period is over? Will poets and readers still have the time to go back to verse online? Or will the fast pace of life bring this exercise to a screeching halt? Ghosh wants to be optimistic. “The lockdown period has forced us to introspect and connect us with some habits that we had forgotten to indulge in. Despite all the gloom, that is a positive effect of this quarantine. I am hoping that this habit stays on,” said the actor.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74991010,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-221751,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/poetry-soothes-nerves-in-times-of-social-distancing/articleshow/74990936.cms

PANAJI: Had they waited for the government to come to their rescue, the disabled, and the elderly living alone would have long perished during the lockdown weeks.

Following the government’s diktat to stay at home, the aged tell TOI they survived the rough lockdown only thanks to the generosity of their neighbours and friends who helped replenish their stocks of basic essentials.

No help was forthcoming from government representatives who otherwise frequent their homes before elections.

Julia, 75, who lives alone with her disabled daughter on the outskirts of Margao, is furious. She panicked after the lockdown was announced and called the MLA from the neighbouring constituency who is known to her on March 26. She is yet to hear from him.

Elderly slam politicians over poor supply of groceries

I was so frightened that’s why I called him. ‘Poita, Poita’, is all he told me. My councillor must have died. He hasn’t even provided me with garbage bins,” she says with frustration.

Her disabled daughter, who relies heavily on her medication, has been without it since March 28 and Julia neither uses a mobile phone nor the internet.

“I’m afraid to leave the house. The pharmacy keeps promising me they will send me medicines but I’m still waiting,” Julia says, adding that her neighbours and friends have been helping her with some groceries.

“Only God has helped me through my Hindu neighbour and friends,” she says. “The councilor should have called for courtesy’s sake or come to see how we are surviving or atleast send someone to inquire,” says Julia, who is surviving on the little money she has left. When she went to the bank on March 16, the government had not deposited the Rs 2,000 under the DSS scheme, which she depends on.

After her bitter experience, she has decided she will stay away from voting in the next election.

“I used to pay Rs 200 for a rickshaw to take my daughter to the polling station to vote for every election without fail. I’m not going to go anymore. They come to us when they’re in need but when we’re in need they don’t care,” she says.

Person with disabilities Vishant Nagvekar living in the state capital says he received groceries at his doorstep only after he made a hue and cry about it on social media. He was forced to do this after he couldn’t get through any of the helplines announced by the government and Panaji corporation.

“During elections, the government representatives know all the houses of the disabled, and provide water, wheelchairs and transport to the polling station, but during this crisis, they have failed. The officers are all the same, so why can’t they directly reach out to those in need?” he asks.

Instead of centralised helpline numbers, the government should have published local contact numbers like that of the booth-level officer who arranges everything during the elections. Similar provisions could have been made, he says.

For an 85-year-old doctor living alone in Chorao, it was again his friends who are helping him through this rough patch. “My friends have been very helpful, otherwise it would have been impossible to survive,” he said.

The government should have given people prior notice of the lockdown and made better arrangements, he says. “The government went about it in a scatterbrained manner. They didn’t make any arrangements. While we have been struggling for groceries here, my relatives in Panaji and Taleigao are perfectly all right. Their government representatives have looked after them, but ours have not looked after us,” he says.

In another instance, a Caranzalem resident had a tough time standing in three hour long queues procuring groceries for his 92-year-old mother, who lives alone with her caretaker in Panaji. His request for a travel pass, specifically for the distance from his place in Caranzalem to Panaji was rejected by the government.

“I didn’t ask for the pass to fool around. I mentioned that my mother is dependent on me for her supplies but they rejected it after three days,” he told TOI.

“The government hasn’t factored in the problems of the elderly living on their own. I need a pass to be able to rush to her if there’s an emergency. Do they expect me to go online and register for a two-hour-pass at the time of an emergency? The twohour window is not even enough to buy groceries from our neighbourhood supermarket,” he says , adding that the announcement put out by the government sounds like the 92 year old has to apply for the pass herself.

This system is a great injustice to those who cannot apply for it online, he says.

The government should have been proactive rather than reactive, he says, adding that they were busy focussing on the zilla panchayat elections when they should have been channelising their energies on how this public health crisis would pan out.

CHANDIGARH: Having volunteered for self-quarantine, little did Tammana Jain, a student who returned from UK know that she would test Covid-19 positive. She recovered from the disease in a fortnight. She attributes the speedy recovery to will power, positive thinking, meditation and a fighting spirit. Tammana, who was admitted in Bhagat Phool Singh, PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan Sonipat, also contributed Rs one lakh towards the CM’s Corona relief fund. The 23-year-old student of Masters in Applied Mathematics in the University of Cambridge , UK reached home on March 18 and quarantined herself.

“Initially, I had cough. Without taking any chances, I approached BPS PGIMS and was admitted there. The next day, I tested positive. Certainly, I was sad and disappointed but I was confident of coming out it,” said Tamanna.

While her family members were anxious, they maintained a positive outlook through meditation and the guidance of their spiritual guru, she said, adding that her determination helped her to defeat the disease.

“I was determined to recover and in the very next test I was tested negative. Two more tests were also negative and I was discharged,” she said. Tamanna expressed gratitude towards the consultant physician and those who supported and encouraged her in the isolation ward. Speaking to TOI over phone, Tamanna and her brother Nitin said their friends and neighbours supported them through the ordeal.

“Since our family was quarantined, neighbours were a great help to us. Unlike others in quarantine who are looked upon as untouchable, we had all the support of people in the neighbourhood,” said Nitin.

252,['5/04/2020'],Roz khao ande: High-protein diet won’t pinch pockets as supply cools prices,"Image used for Representative purposes

KOLKATA: The price of the highprotein diet that doctors recommend to help you fight against the novel coronavirus is finally stabilising in Kolkata.

The cost of eggs has reduced, chicken price has stopped fluctuating wildly, the price of mutton has come down from this Holi’s Rs 700-plus stratospheric levels and the movement of fish-laden trucks has resumed from Andhra Pradesh, giving the non-vegetarian many more options to stock up on some much-needed protein.

Chicken and egg prices had first crashed because of baseless rumours that their consumption was linked to the spread of nCoV; the prices then spiked sharply as supply fell to near-zero. Mutton prices breached the Rs-700 mark — around Holi — as its demand soared (as people went off poultry). And, of late, fish prices have soared because of lack of supply from Andhra Pradesh, one of the biggest suppliers to fish-loving Bengal. All this led to a disruption in the supply-chain dynamics over the past few weeks.

But, with the Bengal government taking the lead to talk to Andhra Pradesh and Odisha officials to regularise truck movement, supplies have resumed. Nearly 90% of the eggs that Bengal consumes come from Andhra and Telangana and egg lovers have been the first to benefit; its price has plunged to between Rs 3.80 and Rs 5.50 apiece in different markets.

Traders look at recovering losses

Egg price can stabilize at Rs 4 each if supplies remain regular,” a trader said. “Also, the fact that roll counters have downed shutters means supply has outstripped demand,” he added.

The price of a kilogram of dressed chicken, too, has stabilized around the Rs 170-Rs 200 mark. It had swung wildly from Rs 120 a kg because of the chicken-nCoV rumours to Rs 250 a kg. West Bengal Poultry Federation general secretary Madan Mohan Maity hoped people would continue to buy chicken to preempt fluctuation in demand. “There was a major disruption in poultry economics that affected small and unorganized players. We hope to recover some of our losses,” he said.

Mutton prices have followed that of chicken to stabilize at Rs 630-Rs 660 a kg. “The supply of goat and sheep from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh has improved. This has led to cooling of mutton prices in Kolkata,” said Moinuddin Haji of Kidderpore Meat.

The price of several varieties of fish, too, has dipped by Rs 50 a kg as trucks with stock from Andhra Pradesh have started arriving in the city. “Prices can dip further if supply remains steady,” said Howrah Fish Vendors’ Association general secretary Syed Anwar Maqsood.

Hardly anybody thinks about them – except when there is a tragedy in the family. Hardly ever do they get their salaries on time. And whenever they do, it is hardly enough to make ends meet (they now get Rs 14,000 a month but till recently BBMP paid them a salary of Rs 1,000).And yet, grave-diggers and helpers are among the first ones to donate an entire month’s salary to the Chief Minister’s fund o that the government can procure(PPE) for health workers who are fighting at the frontline and provide succour to the less fortunate who have fallen on hard times due to the unprecedented lockdown.“All these years, society fostered us. Now, it is our turn to give something back,’’ said Sowri Raj, State Secretary, Burial Ground and Electric Crematoria Employees’ Association.On Friday morning, the representatives of grave-diggers and helpers – there are 148 of them in all -- met BBMP Commissioner BH Anil Kumar and handed over a letter giving their consent to donate their salary to Chief Minister’s Covid-19 Relief Fund.They said that they owed it to society as a few months ago, not only did the(BBMP) was “kind enough” to fix Rs 14,000 per month as honorarium for each of them, it was also the “generosity” of people conducting the last rites of their loved ones which saw them through tough times.At Rs 14,000 a month, the total amount for 148 grave diggers would come to Rs 2,072,000.C, a grave-digger at Hebbal burial ground, said that the decision gave her immense satisfaction. Kutty, who works at Kalpally Electric Crematorium, told Bangalore Mirror that he is happy to be doing this and has absolutely no regrets about letting a month’s salary go.A Suresh, State General Secretary of Dr BR Ambedkar Dalitha Sangarsha Samithi said the gesture to contribute a month’s salary was commendable. “It will be difficult for them to make ends meet without wages for a month but they too want to do something to society. All these years, the BBMP did not consider them as human beings and used to pay them only Rs 1,000 per month,’’ said Suresh.This is not all. Association members are also making personal contributions to supply groceries to needy people and migrant labourers at a few locations. “We have supplied five kg rice, one kg toor dal, cooking oil and sugar to each of the needy people,” said Sowri Raj.Describing the grave-diggers’ decision as an “incredible gesture”, civic evangelist V Ravichandar said it should encourage those who are in better positions to contribute to society.Former KarnatakaJustice Santosh Hegde echoed his sentiments.Sai Datta, a social activist, said he was impressed by the grave-diggers’ initiative. “Publicity mongers should look up to these people as role models.

She told TOI that her working hours are not fixed. She leaves for work around 7.30am and does not even go home to take lunch. She returns home only after midnight after briefing the night duty staff at police stations in her division.Sharma said that seven Tablighi Jamaatis, including two foreign foreigners were found in her jurisdiction area and she has to keep a check on their health situation every minute. She also has to arrange for their medical screening and take them to the quarantine centre. Expectedly, she is exposed to many risks throughout the day. She said that she keeps a spare uniform in her vehicle and changes it at her office if the need arises. Speaking on the precautions being taken by her at home, she said that she goes home just for 4-5 hours to sleep. She added that she takes entry from the backside of the house and goes straight to the basement where she takes a bath and washes her uniform. She makes it a point to enter the house after proper sanitisation.Speaking on the challenges faced while enforcing the lockdown in Old City areas, Sharma said that people there are accustomed to stay outside their homes late till night.

A dversity has given rise to innovation in these hard times with over a dozen youths in the city and over 300 across the state volunteering to offer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones, as they are better known, to tackle the rising cases of corona. Looking at the enormity of the task at hand, these youths have offered different kinds of drones to the state police and health authority for purposes that vary from surveillance, spraying of disinfectants, identifying people suffering from fever, to making announcements and delivering medicines at different places.The Ahmedabad police has successfully tested these drones and begun using the UAVs for monitoring and to make announcements in the city. Earlier, Minister of State for Home Pradipsinh Jadeja visited the control room set up at the police commissioner’s office in Shahibaug on Friday to have a look at the arrangements. Jadeja told Mirror, “We have started this drone surveillance which will help the police in preventive measures. I visited the control room at police commissioner’s office and saw the arrangements. We have also started drone services inand.”According to, DCP, Cyber Crime, Ahmedabad, “We have started aerial surveillance with drones equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) in the city. There are four centralised drones that work for control room at Shahibaug office, while eight drones are kept for various police stations,” said.Regarding its utility, the DCP said, “The drones will identify crowd and intimate police control room while flying. It has capacity to map distance between two persons with the help of artificial intelligence. The drone will be used to make announcements too.”“We have started using drones in the city to help the police department for surveillance and all other work needed to prevent the spread of corona. There are four centralised monitoring drones at the commissioner’s office, while eight other drones will be kept at police stations,” said Nikhil Methia who is spearheading the Gujarat Drone Squad that is providing the drone services.The squad is also developing a system whereby the drone pilot sitting at home can help the police. “We have already created centralised dashboard and we can connect any drone in the city through the board. So a pilot can fly a drone from his or her terrace as and when the police need help in the area of two kilometre periphery where the drone pilot lives,” Methia added.Fourteen city-based youths have started flying their drones, while 40 are ready to fly at short notice.The modern drones will have applications that will use artificial intelligence to identify people for specific purposes.Explaining this, Methia said, “We have developed applications that use AI in drones to identify persons at specific places to know if they are maintaining social distance of more than one metre when these drones fly over them. Another is a thermal drone that can determine a person’s temperature by flying 20 metre above in a crowd. Such persons can be medically screened and tested to ascertain whether the person has been infected.”Methia created the squad after the outbreak of corona. He circulated forms on social media and appealed to drone users to take part in the service to prevent the pandemic from spreading far and wide.“After I made an appeal on social media, around 320 drone pilots have volunteered to help the police and government authorities. I have asked them to help police in their respective city or district,” he said.Shivam Patel, a 21-year-old businessman who has been flying drones for the past seven years, has volunteered for the project. Patel said, “I am happy that I am able to provide my services to the police department during this crucial time.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-80063,msid-74988185/74988185.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/youths-offer-their-drones-to-ahmedabad-police/articleshow/74991459.cms

The maritime bodies and other stakeholders from port sector held a meeting with Mandaviya, through video conferencing, to discuss the plight of Indian seafarers, who are outside India currently, and various issues faced by the Indian maritime industry due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Halbe called the meeting ""extremely fruitful"" and said he expects the government to take steps after the lockdown is over.

Maritime Union of India (MUI) General Secretary Amar Singh Thakur said, ""The minister agreed that there is a need to treat seafarers as 'essential workers' and to provide smooth relief facilities in ports. Their welfare should be looked after whilst they are onboard and in transit.""

National Union of Seafarers of India (NUSI) General Secretary Abdulgani Serang said, ""I assured the minister that NUSI will certainly do the needful to financially support Indian seafarers in the current scenario when Indian economy is passing through a rough phase due to pandemic across the globe.""

He said NUSI has earmarked a corpus of Rs 10 crore to support retired Indian seafarers, disabled seafarers, widows of seafarers and jobless seafarers who have been out of job for the past nine months.

""This novel move is aimed at alleviating their economic hardships in the current pandemic scenario,"" he added.

Mandaviya on Friday had exhorted port officials and other stakeholders to convert the present crisis into an opportunity by ensuring smooth cargo operations so that supplies are not hit during the lockdown.

The representatives from ports sector had raised concerns on high port operation cost, port congestion, shortage of labourers, movement of workers and truck drivers, among others, due to the lockdown.

India has 12 major ports -- Deendayal (erstwhile Kandla ), Mumbai, JNPT, Mormugao , New Mangalore, Cochin, Chennai, Kamarajar (earlier Ennore), V.O. Chidambaranar, Visakhapatnam, Paradip and Kolkata (including Haldia).

""Even otherwise, the world-wide recession is likely to have adverse affects on the Indian economy ,"" the Belgian-born Indian economist told PTI in an interview.Talking about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the Indian economy and job creation, Dreze noted that some sectors are badly affected, but segments like medical care may even grow during the crisis.""Most sectors would be unable to thrive if others are not in good shape.""... It's like, if a bicycle has a puncture, you cannot expect it to move forward on one wheel. In short, if the crisis lasts, it will spread to most parts of the economy, including the banking system,"" he emphasised.Observing that as soon as the lockdown is relaxed, migrant workers who are marooned in different parts will try to return home, Dreze pointed out that they will probably hesitate to migrate again for a while.""But there is hardly any work for them at home, except for some farming if they have land,"" he said, adding that because of reduced migration, sectors that rely heavily on migrant labour may face a shortage of manpower.Pointing out that already there are reports of shortage of labour for wheat harvest in parts of north India, Dreze said, ""This is the paradox of this situation, that shortages and surpluses may coexist, because the circulation channels have been severely disrupted.""Asked whether it is the right time to go for Universal Basic Income (UBI), he said this is not the time to reinvent the wheel.""That is why it is best to build on existing schemes for now, including the public distribution system and social security pensions.""...

GUWAHATI: Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday warned the delegates from the state, who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation, to disclose their identities and come forward voluntarily for quarantine and undergo Covid-19 tests as cases linked to the Nizamuddin gathering continued to spike across the state and country.

Besides, with passing of days, it has come to light that many more people had attended the meet than initially thought. The first alert had said 299 people had gathered at the meet. The latest numbers suggest that up to 2,000 people had attended the meet.

""The Nizamuddin-sourced cases now seem to have spread across the state. First in Barak Valley (southern Assam), then South Salmara (western border) and today (Saturday) in North Lakhimpur (easternmost Assam on north bank of Brahmaputra). The list of those who attended the event is getting longer every day. They are not cooperating with us and so, for one last time, I request all those delegates to Tablighi Jamaat to declare their names or else the health department will have to give the responsibility to Assam Police to locate them,"" Sarma said.

Sarma said so far 812 samples of delegates from Tablighi Jamaat have been collected, of which 24 samples have tested positive. ""Samples from 636 other delegates have tested negative but we are quarantining them and their samples will be tested again after 14 days. We are awaiting for results of 152 samples,"" he said.

Of the 25 Covid-19-positive cases so far in the state, 24 of them have links with Nizamuddin - four each from Morigaon and Nalbari, nine from Golaghat district , three from Goalpara district one each from North Lahimpur, South Salmara, Hailakandi and Kamrup districts.

What worries the health department more is the second layer of transmission by the infected persons who have come from Nizamuddin. ""For one infected person in Guwahati, we have identified 111 people coming in contact with him. Imagine the contacts the 512 delegates from Tablighi Jamaat might have made,"" Sarma said.

In the other northeastern states too, Tablighi Jamaat attendees have tested positive - one in Arunachal Pradesh and another in Manipur.

Another thing special about the Super Pink Moon is that it would be the biggest and brightest full moon of the year.Supermoons aren't really humongous in size.

A supermoon occur when the Moon reaches its ‘full moon stage” also reaches perigee. Perigee is when moon is the closest to earth.You must not be influenced by its name, as the moon will not be originally pink in color. It would still be something to look out for as supermoon is something surreal and winsome in itself.There is another interesting story behind the supermoon’s name being the Super Pink Moon. As per North America's oldest publishing periodical Farmer's Almanac- Phlox Subulata, a pink flower which blooms in bunches during the spring time in the east of North America is said to have given supermoon its name.The Super Pink Moon is said to be visible after sunset but in India it will reach its peak brightness at 8:05 am. Thus, one cannot enjoy its beauty fully during the night sky. You can still look out for the Super Pink Moon during late night.

The service would enable doorstep withdrawal of cash without visiting banks or ATMs during lockdown.

KC Garg, the federation secretary, said, ""People from around 10 housing societies availed the services of the pilot project in Wakad from 10.30am to 7pm.""

The pilot service would run on Sunday and Monday from 10.30am to 5pm in other parts of Wakad.

""We had decided that credit/ debit cards of all banks will be accepted at the mobile ATM van and the maximum withdrawal will be Rs5,000,"" Garg said.

In reality many people withdrew money from multiple bank accounts as there was no restriction on the number of cards that can be used.

As a result, the van had to be refilled with cash. But now we plan to allow one person to use only one card to withdraw cash,"" Garg added.

He added that housing societies in Punawale , Rahatni, Tathawade and other areas, too, have demanded that this pilot mobile ATM van be deployed in their areas.

286,['5/04/2020'],Citizens' post-shutdown mantra: Stay disciplined,"A rickshaw-puller carries essentials in Guwahati on Saturday

GUWAHATI: The ongoing lockdown period is a great lesson on cleanliness, appropriate social norms and self-isolation, a section of citizens has said. With more than half of the lockdown period behind us, a number of citizens said they felt this period will have a lasting impact on the way people look at life and that many will move towards healthier habits once things are back to normal.

""Science says it takes 21 days to grow any habit. So, the lockdown can make us better human beings with better social behaviour. The lockdown taught us to be patient, people stood in queues outside shops, ATMs, people were not allowed to roam around unnecessarily. I would be happy to see these changes in people even after life returns to normal,"" said Preeti Das, a Gauhati high court advocate.

Coronavirus has taught people the necessity of maintaining physical distance, said Suman Tembe, a young employee of Guwahati. ""Unnecessary physical contacts such as instant hugs among friends, sharing each other's clothes as a sign of friendship would be a thing of the past. Etiquettes are no longer a choice, it's the need. The lockdown will change the way we look at friendship,"" she said.

For actor-turned-politician Bobbeeta Sharma, cleanliness norms such as washing of hands, regular cleaning of houses, office premises, etc, should now become permanent habits once the lockdown is over.

""Habits such as washing hands, cleaning lifts, touch pads of ATMs were not taken so seriously. But now it has become mandatory health rules. This must continue even after the virus scare is over. We were taught by elders that we should not touch our faces with the hands, since they come in contact with hundreds of other things. These are rules we must continue to follow carefully,"" she said, adding that the city should be cleaned up from time to time.

For Lokesh Mathur, a public relations professional, the best thing the virus taught us was to maintain a healthy social distance. ""I have often picked up fights with people for entering the ATM while I am inside for transaction, when it is clearly written that one person should enter at a time. I hope this period will teach people to be patient and learn to wait for their turn,"" he said.

Prastuti Parashar, another Assamese film actor said, the fear psychosis that was prevailing among people due to the virus outbreak would make people follow social norms in the days to come. ""Queuing in front of shops, being organised in public events, maintaining physical distance in public spaces are lessons that need to be learnt from this period,"" she said.

Atul Borgohain, Professor of Assam Agricultural University , Khanapara and an environmentalist said there should be a lockdown in the entire world every year to rejuvenate the ecosystem. ""The environment has immensely benefitted from the lockdown. Wild animals are showing up without fear, the air is clean, noise pollution is low. I would say, to slow down the process of global warming; all governments across the world should announce a 10-day lockdown every year.""

Ninety cities of India have recorded a dip in air pollution over the past 11 days.

Naushad Hussain, an adventure sports professional and a tour guide from Guwahati, said, ""We are all going through a bad time, but there are lots of things we hope to learn from the lockdown such as recycle, reuse and sustainability. I would back more lockdowns in future as a disaster and disease response plan.""

287,['5/04/2020'],Cleaning waste from 100 houses every day,"Madina Shaikh

PUNE: Madina Shaikh (64) wakes up every day at 4am in her tiny home in Patil estate slums.

After morning ablution in the community washroom, she has a breakfast of tea and biscuits and starts her walk towards Shimla office bus stop.

After a wait for about an hour or so, she boards the bus to Aundh gaon. She dons her mask, gloves and the fluorescent blue and green jacket, and is off to work in 100-odd houses.

Like Shaikh, over 3,500 workers of the solid waste collection and handling (SWaCH) collective are working every day with diligence, so that people do not have to worry about disposal of household waste during the lockdown period.

Infrequent bus service is a problem for her but she doesn't mind the wait for its all in a day's job for her.

""We wait for an hour or so to and fro at the bus stop. But we get a seat in the bus and the weather in the morning is also quite nice. I collect the waste from 100 houses every day. Two collection vans come at 11am, instead of the earlier 2pm. Once it is done, I again take a bus and return home,"" said Shaikh.

A senior citizen, Shaikh is particular about her health and hygiene. Her husband suffered an accident while working as a 'hamal' (porter) and cannot walk properly.

Her younger son stays with her along with his wife and two school-going children.

""My son is at home due to the lockdown. I am the only earning member in my family now. Hence, I make sure that I wash myself and my clothes, gloves and mask the moment I return home. We work with all kinds of waste. I know it is risky, but that is my job. I have to do it to keepmy hearth burning,"" said Shaikh.

However, with societies maintaining social distancing, she is happy that she doesn't have to wait for anyone to open the door.

""We don't have to ring the bell nowadays. The residents are supposed to keep both the wet and dry waste outside their home. We just shout 'kachra' (waste) and leave if people do not open the door. So, our work is completed early these days. We carry our water bottles but do not eat anything as our hands are dirty. I eat once I return home around 2pm,"" said Shaikh.

She says her income has dwindled and it is tough for her to support a family of six.

Has anyone ever thanked her for her work? ""Why should anybody be grateful for the work we do? We don't talk to them, neither do they talk to us. We complete our work and then return home,"" said Shaikh.

On Saturday, Shivajinagar, Lohegaon and Pashan recorded the highest temperatures this summer. Mercury in these locations was just a degree less than 40°C.

Shivajinagar recorded a hot day temperature of 39.1°C, while Lohegaon was a tad lower at 38.8°C on Saturday. Pashan was the hottest in Pune city at 39.2°C.

Anupam Kashyapi, the head of weather, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune, told TOI that this time, high temperatures had been recorded a little late in summer.

""During the earlier years, high temperatures of 39-40°C would be seen around March-end. But this summer, such warm temperatures are being experienced in early April,"" he said. It was because of the western disturbances still influencing the weather over north India.

Mercury climbs up to 39.1°C

Kashyapi said, ""Consecutive western disturbances have been causing precipitation and snow over western Himalayan region. Thus, the northerly wind originating from north India has been reaching parts of Maharashtra . This is one reason why Pune's night temperature remained around 20°C or below on several days recently.""

""Hot southerly winds from the south have also been influencing Maharashtra. Since the regions of origin of these winds are quite warm, their flow into Maharashtra is thus causing temperatures in the state to rise. Mercury in Pune could touch 40 degrees Celsius in the next few days,"" he said.

All the three villages have a mixed population in terms of religious constitution. A total of 16 people under the Dalgaon Police Station had attended the event. Milli said that all these 16 people have been found negative after testing.

""We have destroyed the barricades since it created massive problems when it came to sending medical teams and movement of ambulances. This is an emergency situation after all. After telling the people that everyone who went to the religious congregation have tested negative, they have said they would not put up any fresh barricade,"" Milli added.

Since the declaration of lockdown, many villages in Assam had put up bamboo barricades to keep out 'outsiders'. In one such village, a youth was seen taking a selfie with a banner put up on a bamboo barricade that read: ""Musalman not allowed"". However the youth who posted the photo on social media later apologised for the act in a video.

Milli also said that if people put up barricades at the entry of the villages, it also creates a law and order problem.

""In many villages, petty crimes are still going on. People sometimes defy social distancing protocols out of boredom and start playing lottery. So, it was necessary to bring down the barricades for surveillance purpose as well,"" he said.

Assam Police on Saturday also destroyed barricades that blocked the connecting road between Darrang district and the Bodoland Territorial Region.

Some of them have even started free home delivery of food - in most cases, within a radius of five kilometres.

And to maintain hygiene standards, hotels are incorporating safe delivery practices such as drop and leave, contact-less payments and safe packaging.

Some hotels like The Park are not only delivering food but also medicines among other essential commodities to senior citizens. ""We have regular guests who are missing our food. So, we decided to deliver food at home. We engaged our team and came up with an attractive menu to cater to the needs of our customers,"" said Anirban Simlai, general manager of The Park Hotel, Somajiguda. Other hotels that have started similar services are Park Hyatt and Taj Krishna.

""We are delivering to places within a radius of five kilometres. We deliver the food within an hour of placing the order,"" said an executive of Taj Krishna.

In tune with the lockdown restrictions, all the deliveries are done between 11 am and 6.30 pm. Many hotels have tied up with food delivery apps. ""Apart from food delivery, there are some hotels that are also feeding the poor by either distributing cooked food or delivering raw material.

301,['5/04/2020'],"Punjab: Farmers not keen on doorstep plan, want services in mandis","BATHINDA: Farmers and arhtiyas (commission agents) have termed the proposal of doorstep procurement of wheat as not practically feasible. They claim that cleaning, weighing and loading of grains not feasible in such a system, as it is not possible to take cleaning machines and weighing bridges to the fields or homes of farmers. The farmers fear that procurement season would linger on for much longer, leaving very little time for sowing of cotton crop in the cotton belt.

The farmers and the arhtiyas instead pitched for procurement in mandis with full caution and added the government could increase temporary mandis and spaces available with rice mills. However, they disagreed with each other on how the farmers could be paid. The arhtiyas want that the farmers be paid through them, but farmers prefer a system in which the payment is made directly into their accounts.

The farmers have urged the state government to put in place everything needed for procurement, including bags, ensuring return of all combine harvesters that have gone to other states and reaching of labourers for harvesting.

With public financial management system (PFMS) - which was to be started from this rabi crop harvesting season - would be put on hold and the role of arhtiyas in procurement is expected to remain as in the past.

Wheat has been sown in 35 lakh hectares in Punjab and nearly 180 lakh tonne is expected to be produced in the state. The state government has announced to start the harvesting and procurement from April 15. ""The government needs to educate people, including farmers and labourers, about ways to avoid the spread of the coronavirus,"" said BKU Dakonda general secretary Jagmohan Singh.

Federation of arhtiya association Punjab president Vijay Kalra said, ""We have met food supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and insisted on mandis. We suggested they could add some temporary mandis apart from 158 mandis and 1,832 procurement centres in villages. No farmers should be made to travel for more than two kilometres to sell the crop.""

The results were confirmed by the lab.""He had fully recovered at home by this past weekend. On Monday evening, he felt a bit distressed… He then peacefully returned to his maker,"" Saeeda, who is in self-isolation, said.Tootla was reportedly advised not to travel to India for the gathering, but he was adamant to go.He had participated in scores of similar gatherings across the globe, according to fellow clerics, but none of whom could confirm if other South Africans had also attended.Tootla's extended family is in self-isolation for 14 days, although none of them have tested positive for the virus.IBC chairperson Salim Kazi said small adjustments were made for Muslim burials to ensure compliance with the government guidelines during the 21-day nationwide lockdown which is now in its 8th day.The guidelines restrict the number of people who can attend a funeral, so hundreds of people who had known the Islamic leader had to be advised to offer prayers for him in their homes.Goolam Dhoodat of the KwaDukuza Muslim Burial Service helped to coordinate the cleric's funeral arrangements, the News24 report said.He said the body was transported to Durban, where a dedicated nurse supervised the general procedures.According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, South Africa has 1,585 Covid-19 cases and nine people have died of the disease in the country.Meanwhile, majority of the people who tested positive for the disease in New Delhi are those who took part in the religious congregation.According to Delhi's Health Department, 301 patients out of the 445 cases in the state are those participated in the Tablighi Jamaat.Chief minister Kejriwal said that the number of cases could spike as all 2,300 people evacuated from the Tablighi's 'markaz' were being tested.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74992104,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-111371,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/s-african-muslim-cleric-dies-of-coronavirus-after-attending-nizamuddin-congregation/articleshow/74992076.cms

They are planning to delay the process, as the workers who operate agriculture machinery are also not available due to coronavirus threat. The government, meanwhile, has allowed the shops that sell agriculture machinery and spare parts (including its supply chain) to open, indicating that harvesting will go ahead as usual.

A progressive farmer, Sukhminder of Saphera village in Ambala district, who runs a custom hiring centre (CHC), said, ""At this moment, the workers who operate the harvesting machines are not ready to come for work, as they fear coronavirus. Their family members are also not allowing them to go for work.""

At present, there is no clarity among the farmers, about how to manage the wheat as space for keeping it safe is an issue. We fear if the weather becomes bad in the coming days, it will be big trouble for the farmers. As of now, we are planning to delay the harvesting due to the Covid-19 outbreak and due to space constraints for storing wheat. If we start harvesting, managing the crop is an issue and the labourers required for loading and unloading are not available.

BHOPAL: As board exams for the students of MP board have been postponed by the school education department in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the board helpline is buzzing with calls from students of Classes 10 and 12 asking the counsellors when the exams will be held and when the results would come out.

“Students are worried that if they don't keep inquiring they might miss out on important information like declaration of timetable for the exams that had been postponed after March 20. Most of the calls are mostly regarding the new exam dates as well as the declaration of results,” said Hemant Sharma , director of Madhya Pradesh Board of Secondary Education (MPBSE).

He added that there were many rumours circulating online which are creating confusion among the students. One such message that was doing rounds on messaging apps was that even students of board exams will be given general promotion, leading to several students wanting to clarify if this was true.

“It is a good thing that students have the presence of mind to call up the helpline to confirm if such rumours are true. We are also getting calls from students of junior classes regarding general promotion and the no-detention policy,” Sharma added.

The helpline functions all year round and counsellors take calls in three shifts. From January 1 to April 3, the helpline has received around 38,000 from students of different districts.

Sharma said, “We receive calls from remote villages where students don’t really have access to information. The nature of the calls depends upon the time. In the months of January and February we get calls regarding preparation of exams, clearing doubts of difficult subjects and time management.”

Both, the Raj Bhavan and CM House also fall in the containment area.Apart from Professors' Colony, which was declared the first containment area in the city on March 22 afer a girl who traveled from UK was detected Covid positive, Durga Nagar, Semra, Shyamla Hills, areas of Aishbagh and Jehangirabad, area around New Market, areas of Shivaji Nagar and Char Imli , Indira Colony and Trilanga are the six containment areas. In these areas, people from outside are also not being allowed in. If one has to go out of the ""barricaded"" area or has to go into the area, permission of rapid action force headed by SDM is required, but police has been more or less ""liberal"" in allowing people to go out to get essentials.A person living just a stone's throw distance from the family in which two infected persons were found in Professors' Colony said, ""Though the administration claims to provide all essential items to people living in the containment area but ever since our colony was declared a containment area, milk supply was discontinued. Both the milk booths in the colony are closed because police do not allow trucks carrying milk packets to come into the restricted area. But cops don't mind 300 to 400 people going out to purchase milk.""Residents in other containment areas, however, said that milk booths in their area are open and vegetable vendors are also allowed.""We are allowing the trucks carrying milk into the restricted area. The municipal corporation trucks selling vegetables is also being allowed. We don't stop the newspaper hawkers also. Our only request is to people, not to step out of their houses"", said TI, Shyamla Hills police station, BPS Bais.Since Professors' Colony also falls under the jurisdiction of Shyamla Hills police station, when Bais was told that residents of Professors' Colony were not getting milk because police are not allowing milk-carrying trucks into the colony, he said ""The milk booth owner himself must not be opening his outlet.""As the infection spreads to new areas, administration and police have tweaked the mode of barricading too. For example, they have stopped entry and exit at Fortune Pride on the two gates of the society rather than barricading roads and areas in the vicinity of the colony. ""There are over 60 duplexes in the colony and two gates. The colony is located in a remote corner. So, we only stopped entry and exit into the colony at the gates rather than barricading areas outside,""said TI, Shahpura police station, Chandrabhan Patel.Similarly, police have barricaded only the mosque from both sides in Aishbagh from where four jamaatis with Coronavirus infection were found.

Finance minister Manpreet Badal told the council of ministers on Saturday during a meeting that the state's revenue loss was expected to go up in absence of revenue from Goods and Service Tax (GST) and petroleum taxes.

The Punjab government collects around Rs 3,250 crore per month from tax revenue and Rs 306 crore per month from non-tax revenue . Since the movement of almost all vehicles, except emergency vehicles, has come to a halt, the state government will lose revenue on account of collection of value added tax (VAT) from diesel and petrol. Similarly, the state government is losing excise duty because of closure of liquor vends.

The finance minister had earlier this week said that the state government was suffering loss of Rs 1,700 crore per day in gross state domestic product (GSDP). The state government, however, managed to pay March salary to its 3.50 lakh employees and pensions to 2.50 lakh pensioners on time.

The chief minister asked all government departments to submit detailed proposals by April 8 about expenditure cuts.

""We have to save people, that should be our priority,"" said Amarinder and added that resources have to be made available for health, police and other concerned departments directly involved in the battle, which threatens to be a long one.

It is unclear whether the high court will treat the petition as urgent as it is presently only considering matters requiring urgent attention through videoconferencing.

PATIALA: To ensure reliable and secure grid operations during the lighting load switch off on April 5, following a call given by Prime Minister Narender Modi , Power System Operation Corporation Limited (PSOCL) has issued an advisory for reliable and secure system operation. In line with the national plan chalked out by PSOCL, even Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has taken steps to ensure that there is no power failure in the state.

PSOCL is expecting that during switch off, the power load across the nation will fall by 12,879 MW. To handle the reduction in power demand that will occur in two to four minutes and recover after nine minutes, it has decided to reduce generation at thermal Inter State Generating Stations (ISGS) to a near technical minimum level of 60% by 20:55 and simultaneously increase the hydro generation to maintain the load generation balance.

On April 5 evening, during the peak hours from 6.10pm to 8pm, the hydro generation will be reduced and conserved for providing flexibility during the switch off. During this time, thermal and gas generation shall be scheduled in a manner so as to manage the peak demand, says PSOCL.

PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director Baldev Singh Sran said the state power corporation has requested all domestic consumers to switch off only residential lights and keep other domestic gadgets on so that the load-demand balance at the grid can be maintained. At present, only hydel plants are running in Punjab and their response is much faster than of thermals power plants.

Sran said PSPCL has sufficient sources to handle the dip and regain of demand through Ranjit Sagar Dam and other hydro plants. He added that local bodies have been advised to keep streetlights on so as to avoid any law and order problems.

The power generation companies have been advised to keep the hydro units rolling at 0 to 10% of the rating and not disconnect during this period. The gas-powered station will be ramped down to the minimum level.

During the actual event when lakhs of household in the country are expected to switch off lights, ramping up of thermal machines will be carried out from 9.05pm while hydro generation shall be ramped from 21.09pm.

Here's looking at four such dishes that have gone viral online and why.Many coffee lovers have been kicked about the viral Dalgona Coffee recipe. It earned its name from a popular South Korean street toffee, and has become a new social-media phenomenon. However, the drink itself isn't as new. In fact, people back home know it as feti hui coffee. It's made by whipping equal proportions of instant coffee, sugar and hot water until it becomes creamy and then adding it to cold or hot milk. Ruchika Dev, a netizen, who has grown up drinking it at home says, ""This turned out to be another example of the West rechristening something and us falling for it. A few years back the Haldi ka doodh was sold to all when named Turmeric latte, and now it's the turn of feti hui coffee to enjoy it's time in the spotlight.""From dips, fried brinjal to curries, people are using aubergine in different ways as they try to cook healthy and use this popular nightshade vegetable in interesting ways. A popular one involves using yoghurt as a base to thicken what's essentially a basic gravy with spices flavoured with onions, red chilli powder, turmeric, salt and mustards seeds. Mina G, a homecook shares, ""Off late I have seen many of my friends share recipes made of brinjal. It's not the most liked vegetable but lasts long, and I guess with restrictions on stepping out most people are getting innovative trying different preparations from a bartha, pakoda to even a curry.""Considering we are confined to our homes, people have taken to baking bread in their kitchens. This has led to many sharing their experiences of a variety of breads including banana and sourdough bread. Many people had gone off flour avoiding it altogether, however, that seems to have changed. Suchi Goyal, a netizen shares, ""I guess people are finding comfort in baking. If you look up social media, you will find many recipes of sourdough bread and banana bread, I guess people are trying to cope by channelising their energy and free time into creating something delicious.""Ramen is essentially a comfort food in Asian cooking. However, the West has clearly found a new love for this Asian dish. This has led to some giving the traditional American favourite Mac & Cheese an Asian twist by substituting the macaroni in the dish for ramen noodles. Shruti Sen, a homecook who has tried it shares, ""I prefer this twist to the Mac & Cheese as the ramen adds more spice to the dish, which gives it tonnes of flavour.""",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74993079,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-102381/74993079.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/4-lockdown-foods-that-have-gone-viral/articleshow/74992986.cms

Not stepping out unnecessarily and now you can't even take your vehicles out, so bamm! Got no choice!But, don't you think sometimes staying at home for too long takes a toll on you? Staying with the same people, in the same room, doing the same thing everyday. Full Big Boss feels! Basically nobody likes monotony.

Invoking Islamic scriptures, they said: “Suicide and courting danger and disease by one’s rash and negligent act is haram or forbidden. The virus does not remain confined to the body of the person who invited it to himself through his foolish act. It travels rapidly in the family and society, and brings indiscriminate deaths to innocents.” They added that the Prophet directed his followers to take steps to prevent the spread of epidemic and to protect oneself.Urging Muslims to follow the public health guidelines, they said that social distancing should be maintained and congregational prayer should be avoided. “Muslims can pray collectively at the mosques after the pandemic dies out and the normal life is restored. Temporarily avoiding going to the mosque to prevent spread of the disease does not mean one has deserted the mosques permanently, as many believe. One can pray at home observing social distancing. Our responsible behaviour would help save the individual, his family and the country at large,” they said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74993251,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-206894,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-19-muslim-ias-ips-officer-urge-community-members-to-cooperate-with-health-workers/articleshow/74993134.cms

367,['5/04/2020'],Longer than expected breaks bigger challenge for fast bowlers: Ashish Nehra,"NEW DELHI: A batsman can do with yoga and weight training but for the merchants of speed, former India pacer Ashish Nehra feels the absence of running for more than three months at a stretch could come in their way of fitness.According to him, the fast bowlers will have to start running sooner or later.India is in the second week of a three-week lockdown enforced to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected over 3000 people.With sporting activities coming to a standstill, the elite athletes are confined to their homes, trying to remain fit while hoping for action to begin once normalcy returns.""Let's consider a few situations. Even if the lockdown ends on April 15, it will take a lot of time for social life to become normal.""If you ask me, I am not expecting any cricketing activity before July. So this is a long break but once action starts fast bowlers have the biggest challenge to remain fit,"" Nehra said.Just like former India team physio John Gloster, Nehra also feels that the paucity of space for most cricketers is a problem and more so for the fast bowlers.""Lack of running time for fast bowlers is an issue. Now the situation is unavoidable. So whoever at least has a garden with say 15 metres or 20 metres space, they should do shuttle run thrice a week unless they are allowed to train at grounds,"" said Nehra.Shuttle run comprises short strides between 20 to 40 metres where players run between points A and B.""You can do as much of yoga or free weights, fast bowler's life is nothing without good running time. There is a lot of difference with batsmen,"" said Nehra, who has been a bowling coach with IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore Why does one need to run more than say cycling or swimming?""It's not just about heart-rate but also about bowling muscles such as hamstring, glutes, groin and calf, they remain activated. Giving a choice between swimming, cycling and running, as a cricketer I would say running. Also a bit of shadow bowling can help in visualization,"" said Nehra, who has played 164 internationals for India (17 Tests, 120 ODIs and 27 T20Is).He had a word of advice for those who have sprawling terraces with soil and grass cover.""It's fine if you are doing Surya Namaskar on terrace but if you start running and doing shuttle run, you will end up damaging your knees and ankles because of hard surface.The very reason that professional players should avoid playing tennis on hard courts in five-star hotels. They are cement courts.""Nehra said that he is confident whether it's the BCCI or ICC, even if there is a semblance of normalcy by June, they will give at least a month's time to the players to prepare, as one can't suddenly start playing.""And injuries can happen to anyone. The fast bowler who has trained the least might be fitter than fast bowler who has trained the most. Nature of sport is such. But yes, I hope that if lockdown ends, they have access to grounds,"" said Nehra.And he also had a word of caution for fast bowlers and professional players in general. Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra, after this prolonged break, can afford to come back with a paunch. Not active players. So break ka matlab ye naahi ki biryani khaani hain (A break from sport doesn't mean you will have biryani).""",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74993284,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-639341,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/cricket/news/longer-than-expected-breaks-bigger-challenge-for-fast-bowlers-ashish-nehra/articleshow/74993267.cms

369,['5/04/2020'],Ways to keep your pet engaged during lockdown,"With social distancing and self-imposed quarantine to fight the Covid-19 virus, the unwitting casualty shouldn’t be your pet. While cats are more self-reliant, it’s your dog that needs special care during this challenging period.So how much exercise does your dog really require? If you have a pup, you’ll notice they get into something called “zoomies” many times a day. They are identified as madly racing around the house, and then collapsing. Since little pups are bounding with energy, they typically require more movement than adult dogs, and thus the zoomies. If you are caring for a growing puppy, factor in more rounds of exercise on a daily basis. Also, the breed of your dog determines how much movement your dog needs on a daily basis to stay sane and happy. For instance, the retriever as a breed are meant to fetch things over distances, making them suited to much more physical activity than they get in the confines of an urban home.The pet’s health is also important. If a grown dog has a medical condition, such as heart or respiratory issues, talk with your vet about an appropriate exercise routine that will help him stay healthy without aggravating the condition.Here are some activities you can safely undertake with your dog, regardless of age or breed, during the lock-down.: You can train your dog to play this in-doors game by awarding them with a little treat when they find you. As mundane as the game may sound, it’s a good way to get a little activity within your home, while also training your dog to be more curious and outgoing by playing it. You can start by leaving a trail of treats leading to your hiding spot, and the more you pet plays the game, the more he will be on to the cues of what to do when you say ‘hide and seek’.Heard about Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Toys? If your pet is looking bored, nothing like a new toy to cheer it up! Improvise a plastic bottle toy, a T-shirt tug toy, or ball toy. An old T-shirt can be cut into three strategic places. Take a tennis ball, place it inside two of the pieces and take the smallest piece of cloth to tie the toy together. The remaining pieces can be cut into strips and can be further braided. You can also use your pet’s favourite toy as bait as you pull for a game of tug-of-war.: If you have not had the time to train your dog to perform various tricks till now, this is a good time to get started. A simple trick like shaking hands is an easy way to start. You can also get your pet to perform more impressive tasks like jumping through hoops, chasing bubbles or shaking to music with a little patience. Getting your pet to be obedient to verbal commands is the first step in teaching your dog a slew of tricks that can be mastered for life. Simple instructions like sit and stay, lie-down, or roll over, can be a beginning.. Make this activity more interesting. Shake up your dog’s fetch routine by making him or her run upstairs to get back a ball, or by tossing a ball across the room. Alternate between balls, Frisbees, and other kinds of toys to keep your dog active.: This activity could not seem like exercise at the onset, but practicing recall, retrieving, and reinforcing basic commands offers mental stimulation, as well as exercise. You can also teach your dog fun new tricks. Things like twirling, weaving and jumping hurdles take time and patience, so what better time to teach these than now?: Wondering what exercise you can factor in for high-energy breeds? Look no further than a treadmill. With careful handling, your pet can develop a love for his or her treadmill workouts. While the treadmill is no replacement for a walk, or a run outside, they do build endurance and aren’t affected by the weather.: This is usually an activity best practiced outdoors. However, at this time, with a little creativity you can recreate the setting within your home. Make your own agility course with common household goods. Things like broom handles, boxes, you kids’ hula-hoops, and ottomans. With these props you can so easily make your pet practice going around them, helping increase his keenness for activity and avoiding objects. This isn’t just an exercise but a great mental activity for them that can give them the stimuli to stay sharp.These are just some ways in which you can keep your pet actively engaged during the lockdown. Get creative and invent more ways to give your pet the exercise and mental stimulation it needs to stay happy and healthy. I reckon that not only are some of these solutions brilliant for your dog, but also you, since the creative and physical energy these activities demand are good for both human and pet to remain gainfully occupied indoors during the lock-down.

NEW DELHI: Immigration wing at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport on Sunday intercepted eight members of the Tablighi Jamaat from Malayasia as they tried to board Malindo Air relief flight bound for their country.

Sources in the immigration department told ANI that the eight members will be handed over to the police.

The immigration department has a list of Jamaat members who attended the religious gathering in Delhi and based on this list the eight members trying to return back to their country were intercepted.

Immediately after completion of formalities, the eight Malaysians were handed over to the aviation security (CISF) personnel at the airport and further process is underway for them to be handed over to the Delhi Police.

As per the rule established by the Centre, all the persons who were intercepted will have to stay in quarantine in India.

The Tablighi Jamaat event held in March in the Markaz building, Nizamuddin area of Delhi has emerged as a hotspot for Covid-19 after several positive cases from across India were linked to the gathering including deaths in Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana.

Many foreign nationals who attended the religious gathering, among other Indians, have tested positive for Covid-19 and nearly 22,000 Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts have been quarantined across the country so far, a home ministry official said on Saturday.

The Centre and state governments have been tracking and checking all those who attended the event in a bid to stop the spread of the disease and to provide treatment to those who are infected.

KANNUR: A 28-year-old newly-wed from Panoor in Kannur died of Covid-19 in the early hours of Saturday in Saudi Arabia.

According to his family and relatives, the man, identified as P K Shebnaz, son of Mammu and Fousiya, residents of Meethale Pookkom in Panoor municipality, had been undergoing treatment at Saudi German Hospital Madinah for the past one week and died around 11.30pm local time on the night of April 3 (around 2am IST on Saturday).

A couple of days ago his friends confirmed that he had tested positive but they never thought he was in a critical condition, said Nizar K, who is close to the family and a member of Panoor municipality. Shebnaz was working with the KFC fast food restaurant chain in Madinah.

However, the Saudi officials have not yet officially confirmed that he died of Covid-19, said Nizar.

Shebnaz's father Mammu said his son got married on January 5 this year, and had gone back after marriage on the night of March 2. Last week he was admitted in the hospital following fever. He was not having any other health problem earlier, said the father.

Since the body could not be brought here, the family has sent the consent for funeral there, said the family.

Meanwhile, the health condition of two Malayalis from Kasaragod, who have been admitted to the same hospital after testing positive for Covid-19, is improving, said hospital sources.

The 29-year-old will join the I-League heavyweights from Naft Masjed Soleyman FC in the Persian Gulf Pro League .

""He has already put pen to paper for our club. He is now in Tehran and he has been signed on a two-year deal,"" the club's executive committee member Debabrata Sarkar told IANS.

Omid was in the spotlight last year when he expressed his desire to play for India. Croatian head coach Igor Stimac had also invited Omid to play for the national team.

Although he was raised in Iran, Omid's father holds an Indian passport.

""I liked to play for Iran national football team but I was not invited to Team Melli. At the moment, Iran are one of the best teams in Asia and it's hard to be part of the team. Mr. Stimac called me and I accepted to play for India,"" he was quoted as saying by Tehran Times last July.

""I am not familiar with Indian football team but I know that they have progressed a lot in recent years. David James, Robert Pires, Nicolas Anelka, Roberto Carlos and Zico have played in Indian league in the past years,"" he added.

Omid started his playing career in Gahar Zagros in Iranian football league and has also plied his trade in top-flight teams Naft Masjed Soleyman, Esteghlal Khuzestan, Pars Jonoubi and Nassaji.East Bengal are placed second on the I-League table with 23 points from 16 matches. Arch-rivals Mohun Bagan have already won the title with four rounds to spare and have a 13-point lead. The I-League is suspended at the moment due to the coronavirus pandemic.

382,['5/04/2020'],"Kerala: More financial powers to secretaries, department heads","<p>A family makes best use of lockdown by engaging in paper crafting at Kodimatha in Kottayam on Saturday.<br>... Read More

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In view of the ongoing crisis related to Covid-19 outbreak , the government has decided to give more financial powers to district collectors and secretaries of departments, thereby reducing the delay in procurement of essential items.

All the secretaries of departments have been given the powers to spend up to Rs 10 crore for procuring any essential item that has been decided in the crisis management group meeting or chief minister’s review meeting to fight Covid-19. The secretaries have been given the powers for procurement without further circulating the papers on the basis of stores purchase rules as per the laid down procedure. Similarly, all the district collectors, department heads and managing directors of PSUs have been given the powers to procure any such essentials spending a maximum of Rs 5 crore at a time.

While doing so, the secretaries and district collectors have been asked to certify that the rates accepted for procurement are fair and reasonable up on a practicable market enquiry.

For procurement above Rs 10 crore and up to Rs 100 crore, of a critical item that was certified by a secretary or head of the departmentconcerned, a committeeconsisting of the concerned secretary, finance secretary and secretary of disaster management department has to give clearance while any procurement that will run beyond Rs 100 crore, will have to be cleared by a committee headed by the chief secretary, secretary of the concerned department, finance secretary and the secretary of disaster management department.

Under usual circumstances, the financial powers are much lower to the tune of up to Rs 5 lakh for the department heads and up to Rs 20 lakh for the secretaries of departments.

Larger funds allocated under annual plan arespentby the departments after constituting working groups and special working groups and placing the projects and procurements before them to get the funds sanctioned.

Those projects below Rs 10 crore are forwarded to a working group that is chaired by the secretary of the concerned department, and the projects that have a budget of more than Rs 10 crore are to be scrutinized by a special working group chaired by the finance secretary that also includes the secretary of the administrative department.

The constitution and meeting of the working groups and special working groups itself is a timeconsuming process, in effect cutting short the implementation time for each of the projects.

Till last Friday they weren’t so sure, because the couple was still in the Covid-19 isolation ward of Kottayam Medical College Hospital in Kerala.Thomas and Mariamma are the oldest couple in India to have contracted the virus so far and to have recovered.Discharged on the evening of April 3, after almost a month in hospital fighting for their lives, they look back on what they went through with incredulity and a little bemusement. “The initial days in isolation in the ICU were very tense and everything was strange,” said Thomas. “Whenever I woke up, the unusually cold temperature and unfamiliar people made me think that I had landed in some foreign country.”The couple contracted the disease from their son and his family who had come home from Italy for a vacation on February 29. A few days later they tested positive for Covid-19 and on March 8, so did Thomas and Mariamma. In the ICU, for Mariamma it was the thought of her children and grandchildren which was a concern. “I used to cry at night,” she recalled. The nurses had a tough time consoling her and make her sleep. Soon, however, the couple got adjusted to the critical care unit.The couple had several old-age related health issues which made treating them more difficult. They had diabetes, hypertension and cardiac problems. Once, the health condition of Thomas deteriorated further and he had to be put on ventilator. He also suffered a cardiac arrest during this period.The medical team held meetings every hour to assess their condition but there was one thing that intrigued them. Initially, the couple had been admitted in separate rooms. “We had never stayed separately since our marriage. We slept in the same room and living even a second without seeing each other was unimaginable,” said Thomas. Mariamma, too, was disturbed by this. Sensing that there could be a psychological toll, the doctors soon shifted them to the ICU ward where they both could see each other.Soon after arriving home in Kerala’s Pathanamthitta district following their discharge, Thomas told Rijo Moncy, his grandson, that he “wanted to see the news on TV”. “The same night he also made me read out the newspapers and how they had reported his case,” said Rijo.Thomas has no doubt that he and his wife owe their recovery to the doctors and nurses who looked after them.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74993707,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-136031,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/for-them-life-after-covid-19-begins-with-tapioca-and-fish-curry/articleshow/74993685.cms

""In a move to extend the availability and reach of online services in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the EPFO (Employees' Provident Fund Organisation) has issued revised instructions to its field offices to facilitate PF members to rectify their date of birth in EPFO records, thus ensuring that their UAN is KYC compliant,"" a ministry statement said.

According to the statement, the date of birth recorded in Aadhaar will now be accepted as valid proof of date of birth for the purpose of rectification, provided that the difference in the two dates is less than 3 years.

The PF subscribers can submit the correction requests online.

It said that this will enable the EPFO to validate the birth date of members online with Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) instantaneously, thus authenticating and reducing the processing time of change requests.

The EPFO has instructed field offices to expedite disposal of online requests, enabling Provident Fund members in financial distress, to apply online for availing non-refundable advance from their PF accumulations to tide over COVID-19 pandemic.

Earlier, the EPFO allowed its subscribers to withdraw three months basic pay and dearness allowance as non-refundable advance on the ground of COVID-19 lockdown from March 28, 2020.

However, the facility was available to those members whose KYC (Know You Customer ) compliance was complete.

Now, this decision would help the members to make their universal account numbers KYC compliant.

While people continue to work from home, they are also utilizing this time to rekindle their hobbies, work out, experiment in the kitchen and more. Ask director Mohan Raja how he’s using the lockdown period, and he says, “I’m spending time with my family, playing games and doing things I couldn’t before owing to my work schedule. More than me taking care of them, the kids are taking care me, not allowing me to step out. They are well informed. I’m seeing life in a new perspective now.”Raja feels that for the kind of population that India has, the country is handling the crisis smoothly. “So, we should be strong and do our bit for the needy. It took me five days to understand the nature of the pandemic and digest what was happening around me. We humans are the virus carrier. So, we can actually contain the spread by self-isolating. Yes, underprivileged people and daily-wage workers have a tough time, but we can individually help them out instead of complaining about their situation. I’m doing my bit for them and I want others to do whatever they can,” he says.Meanwhile, Twitter has been flooded with memes, comparing PM’s ‘lights on’ request to the sequences in his Sivakarthikeyan-starrer. “The two situations are entirely different, but the idea is to bring unity among people,” he says, “At a time when doctors and experts are working to find a solution to this coronavirus pandemic, the best thing we, as citizens, can do is to maintain peace and not create panic.

Suggestions on phase-wise resumption have to be provided by the zone to the board.""These are sensitive times and we are not looking in terms of revenue generation for now. The focus is on passenger safety and to ensure that the disease does not spread. Trains will run in due course, once the government gives us the green signal. However as of now, we have not taken any decision,” said a senior officer.In the zones, officials are also identifying trains and routes which can be resumed with the approval of the board. The focus, say officials, is to see if routes catering to migrant workers can be resumed initially and also those that are not travelling or has halts at COVID-19 hotspots.Officials added that the railways will also have to factor in how the lockdown is eventually opened. If it is selective, then trains will only run in areas where lockdown is lifted, officials said.The Railways is also unlikely to rescind a March 19 order suspending all concessions for passengers except those offered to patients, students and people with disabilities in a hurry, even after the lockdown period to discourage unnecessary travel.The Railways, officials said, are also discussing protocols that need to be followed once services begin to ensure safety of passengers. They are mulling options like thermal screening and other methods to scan passengers boarding trains.""Once the services are resumed, we are thinking of requesting passengers to wear masks as per the health ministry advisory. We are also thinking of using the Arogya app to check the health and wellness of patients and allow only healthy passengers to board trains,” an official said.As part of its preparedness, the Railways has also asked zones to ensure the security of coaches parked in depots.Officials said once the services resume full throttle, they expect overcrowding at stations and measures have to be chalked out on how to deal with them.The focus now for railways, the officials said, is to ensure that the rakes of passenger trains, which were suspended due to the lockdown, had returned to their respective bases, received proper maintenance like charging of batteries, cleaning of bio-toilets, and were ready to return on the tracks once the resumption is announced.Officials also said railway minister Piyush Goyal is keen that the railways concentrate on ensuring that the different zones continue their efforts towards contributing in the larger fight against coronavirus.Railway PSUs have already committed to converting around 5000 coaches as isolation wards initially which are likely to be sent in rural areas that do not have hospitals.The Railways has also offered its hospitals for infected patients and are producing essential medical goods like masks, sanitisers, PPEs.The minister has given instructions that proper planning should be done for cleaning of linens, sanitation and proper disposal of biomedical waste that is expected to be generated at hospitals and isolation coaches.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74994103,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-26887,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/railways-mulling-post-lockdown-precautions-for-passengers/articleshow/74993841.cms

should have multiple layers of fabric that can be machine or hand washed without getting damaged Thicker fabric is better as it can offer greater protection — a heavy cotton T-shirt, for example, can also be cut into a mask

You must ensure that the fabric is washed well in boiling water for 5 minutes and dried well, before you make the mask. Adding salt to this water is recommended

If you are using a bandanna or handkerchief, fold it over twice or thrice before wearing

Just wearing the mask is not important, it is also important how you wear it. Ensure that the masks fits around your mouth and nose and there is no gap between your face and mask. When wearing the mask, the side facing you should show pleats downwards. Never-ever reverse the mask for reuse

The outbreak of coronavirus across the globe has led to a shortage of face masks and sanitizers.

I don't like people with a lot of baggage and rather those who are simple and straightforward and their agenda is to make a brilliant film,"" Aditya told in an interview here.""If my priority is 'Ashwatthama', my actor's priority should also be 'Ashwatthama'. Vicky fits the character, it was a no-brainer for me because when he is doing a project then nothing else matters to me, he will give his blood and sweat for it, he did that with 'Uri..'. And he will remain my first choice for all my films,"" he added.The film, billed as a superhero action film set in modern times, is being planned as a trilogy but Aditya said they will make the third one depending on the response to the first two.Though the team has cracked the basic idea for all the three parts but they are concentrating on the first one at the moment, he added.""The film requires a lot of planning because this is something that has never been done before, it is huge. The work is on in terms of writing,"" the director said, adding the team aims to start rolling by year end or early 2021.Aditya believes spectacle films such as 'The Immortal Ashwatthama' with a touch of Indian mythology must be served more to the audience.As per the epic Mahabharata, Ashwatthama was the son of guru Dronacharya , who fought for the Kauravas in the battle of Kurukshetra.""It was high time we brought such stories to the audience, the kind of fantastic stories we have in our mythology. I wonder why nobody made those into films in so many years. My idea is to create something that is at par with everything that is around the world or Hollywood.""The director said that Vicky is currently busy prepping for 'Takht', which will in a way help the actor to work on ""Ashwatthama"".""It will be unfair for me to tell him to do anything right now related to 'Ashwatthama'. I want him to give his 100 per cent for 'Takht'. There is a huge prep for our film but I don't want to distract him from 'Takht'. Once he gets done then he will have to concentrate on our film.""Besides Vicky, Aditya said the team is looking for a female actor and a villain, who will have well-written arcs.""It is one of the strongest female characters we have ever seen but we haven't finalised anyone yet, we also have a strong antagonist. We are looking across the spectrum for it, like from the south. Maybe a newcomer, we are keeping our options open,"" he added.In a genre largely dominated by men, Aditya believes filmmakers must learn from Hollywood action films and create well-rounded characters for women actors.""Unfortunately, the mistake lies within us, as filmmakers we don't write that many (strong) characters, we need to write it. It is not that they are not capable.""We see Gal Gadot and we say she is so good at action or Emily Blunt in 'Edge of Tomorrow' and we say 'wow', they train and become like that.

NEW DELHI: The cracking Indian men's doubles pair of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy is now hoping to avail the services of a new foreign coach in their Olympic preparation after the sudden exit of Indonesian Flandy Limpele.

Limpele was appointed till the Tokyo Olympics which has been deferred by one year due to global COVID-19 pandemic.

However, last month, Limpele had stepped down as India's doubles coach, citing family reasons, becoming the fourth such foreign coach to have resigned without completing the tenure.

Chirag said the Olympics postponement will now give them more time to deal with the departure of Limpele, who was specifically hired to prepare them for the Tokyo Games.

""We will definitely get more time to prepare now. Since it is more than a year, so I believe we will get a new foreign coach. If the Olympics would have happened this year, then we wouldn't have got since for 3-4 months it wouldn't make sense. But now, BAI might get one to help us,"" Chirag told PTI.

Satwik said the departure of Limpele in the Olympic year was a big worry.

""It is a worry for us because he (Limpele) left us before the Olympics. He is an experienced coach, he used to give us inputs in every match and we trusted him a lot. Since he left we didn't know what to do, what program to follow.

""But now we have a year, so hopefully we will get a new coach and again we will have to adjust to the new regime. So in a way, we got lucky with this postponement.""

Badminton Association of India (BAI) general secretary Ajay Singhania said they will try to rope in a new foreign coach once things return to normal.

""With the Olympic postponement, we are keen to get a doubles coach in order to strengthen the coaching staff. However, we have to wait for the lockdown to get over first so that we can discuss the issue with SAI and the Sports Ministry ,"" said Ajay K Singhania, General Secretary, BAI.

""I have already had a telephonic discussion with National Coach P Gopichand and once COVID19 situation batters off we will take this up.""

Chirag and Satwik, the Commonwealth Games silver medallists, were the first Indian men's doubles pair to win a Super 500 in Thailand and also reached the finals of Super 750 event at French Open last year. It also helped them to break into the top 10.

""If an experienced coach like comes on board, it will make a big difference,"" said Chirag, who has taken to painting to spend time during this 21-day lockdown which has been put in place to fight the spread of coronavirus.

""Now we are almost there, it is a matter of 2-3 points, say we are 90 percent there and a really good coach like for example Rexy Mainaky , who is the head coach of Thailand would give us that extra 10 percent. A high-calibre coach can help us get into the world's top 3.""

Mainaky, a 1996 Atlanta Olympic gold medallist is one of the famous pairs with the other being Ricky Subagja .

Satwik said: ""We have coaches like Dwi Kristiawan and Namrih Suroto, who can make a program for us. Namrih used to handle us when Flandy was not available and we have been training with Dwi too, so they are also well-equipped to help us.""

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has made it clear that ""all of the qualifications that have been achieved by National Olympic Committees and individual athletes remain in place"" despite the Games being postponed.

""It is a big relief. Now the athletes who have qualified for Olympics, can relax and concentrate on the preparation for the Games without any pressure,"" said the 19-year-old Satwik.

""For us, we are not sharp enough, especially in the crucial situation, so we have to work on those areas.""

There are very few projects and everybody is trying to get that project. The reason people turn towards producing films is when they establish themselves, they have the money and resources to become producers. When they enter the industry, they don't have that.""We have such weird notions that after marriage actresses don't get work and when you start producing or directing it means you are doomed as an actor. We look at things in so black and white,"" Radhika told in an interview.The 34-year-old actor hopes more people venture into direction.Citing the example of actor-director Konkana Sen Sharma , she said, ""There are probably only two of us and that is sad. I completely agree that people think 'she is directing so is it because she doesn't want to act anymore, she is changing departments or she is not getting enough work'.""Why does it have to be any of this, why can't I do both? I can act and direct certain projects, if I need or feel like doing it. I hope more people venture into this.""Radhika said she was already trying her hands at writing and 'Sleepwalkers' happened by chance.""It happened coincidentally. I wrote this short film and was reading it out to Abhishek Chaubey and Honey Trehan. They said they will make it immediately. I wanted to make it in the monsoon but by the time we decided to do it, it was over. It was October that time and we had to shoot immediately.""The actor said she had great experience directing the short and supervising various aspects related to filmmaking from direction to editing.""It is extraordinary to be doing different things if they interest you, you learn more about the other department. It was extremely enriching. I now know so much about filmmaking than I knew before. I know how many mistakes I made.

418,['5/04/2020'],Coronavirus: Do I need to clean and dispose of a mask?,"Here are some of the precautions you need to take before you start using your mask:

Cleaning the mask -

Change or clean the mask once its inner lining becomes moist

Cloth masks should be washed regularly, either by hand using soap or in a machine with regular detergent, and air dried

Mask can be reused even if you are sick, but don’t share it with others

Surgical and other single-use masks cannot withstand washing and should be disposed of. If you want to reuse a mask, ensure that it remains dry.

You can store mask in dry ziplock bags, preferably with desiccating gel that can absorb moisture

Disposing of the mask

To properly dispose of a mask, fold it in half inwards so the inner lining is covered.

Fold it in half two more times so it looks like a roll.

Then, wrap the ear loops or strings around the roll so that it does not open up.

Wrap it in a piece of tissue before throwing in a lined, closed bin

Used masks lying around pose health risks if someone comes in contact with the respiratory secretions in them and then touches their face. So, it is important that the masks are cleaned frequently and disposed of when not needed.According to the WHO, masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.It is recommended that you have two masks so that you can wear one, while the other is washed and dried.It is critical to emphasize that aside from wearing masks, maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74994536,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-286755,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-do-i-need-to-clean-and-dispose-of-a-mask/articleshow/74994393.cms

The lockdown is an unprecedented situation for all of us, but I prefer to look at the positives during these challenging times. As professional cricketers, we are travelling constantly and this break has given me an opportunity to spend more time at home.My daughter Aditi, who turned two in February, is a very energetic kid and playing with her keeps me really busy throughout the day. I am even learning new ways to entertain her, like dancing with her or playing some new indoor games. When my wife Puja is cooking, Aditi also goes to the kitchen and we teach her the names of the vegetables. She also loves colouring, watching birds and playing with me in our garden. This break has allowed me to pursue gardening which I really enjoy.In the past, there have been films that I had to miss out on due to cricket commitments but I am watching a few films and TV shows now. Recently, I watchedand loved Irrfan’s performance. I am also working out at the gym in our home to stay fit, apart from practising yoga. Also, with our domestic help on leave, it is my duty to help Puja and although I can’t cook, I try to help her out with household chores like cleaning. We are also keeping in touch with all our friends and relatives via phone calls.The lockdown makes you realise that the importance of money for staying happy is often overrated. All the wealth doesn’t mean a thing if you are not spending quality time with your family. I am not saying that one shouldn’t look to earn money but sometimes, we ignore our families in our day to day lives.The biggest lesson is that we should learn to find time for doing things that we love instead of just going through the motions. This Phase teachs you to appreciate your family more. Also, it’s time to be more empathetic towards people around us.Currently, our academy, where dad and I teach cricket to kids for free, is completely shut down.

BENGALURU: The COVID-19 related lockdown has substantially improved the air quality of Bengaluru, taking it from satisfactory level to good, a senior state pollution control board official said here on Sunday.

""During the course of the lockdown 19 problem, we reached good position from satisfactory.

It is between zero to 50 AQI ( Air Quality Index ) now. We have good quality air,"" the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board member secretary Basavaraj Patil told PTI.

He said the indicator for knowing the air quality in

""If the AQI is zero to 50 then it is good. If it is 50 to 100 then it is satisfactory. 101 to 150 is moderate and if it is 151 to 200, then it is poor, he explained.

Patil said as per available recrods, there has been a 60 to 65 per cent reduction in pollution during the lockdown.

The city railway station and Peenya industrial area, which used to be among the areas with highest AQI, has seen pollution levels come down significantly, he said.

Another major contributor of pollution was construction activities, which too had ground to a halt due to the lockdown, resulting in zero dust emission.

Patil opined that the improved air quality would boost the immune system of the people.

""It will improve the immune system of people, including those who have breathing problems like asthma,"" he said.

He asked the public to learn lessons from the lockdown and later switch to sustainable means of transport such as public transport, walking and cycling,.

""We can still reduce the pollution load even after the lockdown is over,"" Patil said.

On April 4, Prof Lalit Mohan Saini , HOD EE at NIT Kurukshetra , released a video of this prototype on his Youtube channel and shared his email and mobile and asked the industrialists worldwide to contact him and start manufacturing the ventilator on no profits no loss basis for serving humanity and providing the same to the hospitals.

Prof Lalit said, “At present, the world is fighting against the Covid-19 pandemic and it is facing a shortage of high-cost ventilators. Therefore, we have made a prototype of a low-cost ventilator which will only cost around Rs 3,500. A patent application has also been filed in the name of NIT Kurukshetra for this invention.”

Giving details about the ventilator, Prof Lalit said, “The main objective of this ventilator is to provide artificial breathing to the patient at the hospital who is not able to breathe easily. For this task, a crank shift mechanism has been used which will put pressure on an Ambu-bag and it will be connected to the patient’s mouth to provide artificial breathing through a pipe.”

“As per their experience, the doctors at the hospital can control the speed of ventilator and volume of air given as artificial breathing as per age and requirement of the patient. This ventilator works with electricity and in case if the power goes off; it automatically shifts to a battery attached with it and remains operational"", said Prof Lalit.

""The patent application has many more features like a closed-loop control system to control the above-said parameters as per body parameters of the patient. We can add more features and accordingly the cost would increase"", further added Prof Lalit.

Similar criticisms have been leveled at other world leaders including the presidents of Mexico, Brazil and the United States.In February, Macron made a point of repeatedly kissing Italy's premier on a visit to Naples to show there was nothing to fear. At the time the virus was already spreading fast across France, but limited testing meant health authorities didn't yet know.In early March, he toured a retirement home even as he announced that families should no longer visit elderly relatives. That same day he went with his wife to a Paris theater where the owner tweeted that the president wanted to show that ""life goes on."" By then the official virus infection numbers in France were doubling every two days.In mid-March, as COVID-19 was ravaging neighboring Italy, France went ahead with the first round of nationwide municipal elections. First lady Brigitte Macron strolled the banks of the Seine, which were crowded with Parisians enjoying a sunny day despite recommendations of social distancing.It wasn't until March 16 that Macron abruptly changed his tune, declaring war on the virus and announcing nationwide confinement measures. A week later he appeared wearing a face mask for the first time at a field hospital set up by troops outside Mulhouse, the eastern city that saw an eruption of cases stemming from a five-day evangelical gathering.The armed forces took on a key role, as military and hospital authorities worked out the system to shuttle patients to less-strained hospitals and medics to virus zones in need.The first ""medicalized"" TGV made its inaugural trip on March 26. Doctors in protective gear pushed gurneys along the nearly empty platform of the train station in the eastern city of Strasbourg as safety warnings echoed from loudspeakers. Inside the double-decker cars, patients and webs of tubes and wires were squeezed past luggage racks and rows of seats. Once they were secured, the train sped off toward less impacted hospitals in the west.While the militarized mobilizations are popular, public debate has mushroomed over issues such as the relatively low numbers of people being tested for the virus in France and shortages of medical equipment. Macron ordered all face masks requisitioned for medical personnel after it became evident France entered the crisis well short of the necessary supply.""The question of masks is now the priority question for the French,"" said Jean-Daniel Levy of polling agency Harris Interactive, adding that the public feels the government ""didn't take enough responsibility"" for it at the outset.France has had to send some patients for treatment to tiny neighboring Luxembourg, Switzerland and Germany, which has conducted massive nationwide testing and confirmed more cases than France while recording a death toll about one-fifth as high so far.Macron, a centrist, has taken fire from both ends of the political spectrum.Far-right leader Marine Le Pen told France 2 television that ""the government lied about the preparedness of the country,"" while far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said Macron, a former investment banker, ""used to think that the free market would meet the country's needs, so his mental framework collapsed.""Among the broader public, Macron ""is seen as relatively authoritarian,"" Levy said. That hurt him during the protest movements but helps his popularity now because ""we want to have a strong authority figure"" to manage the crisis.In the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, a fact-finding mission is scrutinizing the government's handling of the emergency.Macron, however, said while visiting a mask manufacturing company that it's not yet time to focus on what went wrong.""When we're fighting a battle, we must all be united to win it,"" the president said. ""And I think those who seek to send people to trial when we have not yet won the war are irresponsible.""",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74995226,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-64738,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/france-turns-to-speedy-trains-to-catch-up-in-virus-response/articleshow/74995210.cms

447,['5/04/2020'],I examine the Mahabharata from scientific perspective: Christopher Doyle,"In 2006, Christopher C. Doyle, a growth catalyst and CEO coach, set out to write a book for his seven-year-old daughter who was deeply interested in mythology and history. Today, he is the hugely successful author of the ""The Mahabharata Quest"" series with two books released, a third due later this year and one or two more in the pipeline. He has also hit pay dirt with his ""The Pataala Prophecy Series"" with two books out and three more envisaged.""There were a couple of options available to me. I could have written a fictional fantasy story, inspired by the Mahabharata, setting the plot in an imaginary, fantasy world, like JRR Tolkein was inspired by Nordic and British mythology, which found expression in Lord of the Rings.""Or I could write a fictional retelling of the events in the Mahabharata, setting the story in ancient times and using charactersfrom the epic to flesh out the story,"" Doyle, who now publishes with Westland, told IANS in an interview.""I had already written a story for my daughter, in 2003, which was set in a fantasy world and was inspired by Indian mythology so I decided against the first option. And the second option didn't appeal to me because I wanted to explore a scientific explanation for some of the stories in the Mahabharata. My intent was to write a story that was based on the premise that the mythology of the Mahabharata could have been based on events and concepts that can be explained using real scientific facts not science fiction or speculation,"" Doyle, a graduate of Delhi's St Stephen's College and who holds an MBA from IIM-Kolkata, explained.So he decided to write a story for his daughter that was set in present times and ""which connected the past and the present, using science, history and mythology. Over a period of two years, he wrote and narrated this story to his daughter and, in 2008, his first book ï¿½ ""The Mahabharata Secret"" - was born.Noting that he has always been keenly interested in the Mahabharata ï¿½ he belongs to the generation that grew up watching B R Chopra's television adaptation of the epic ï¿½ he began to wonder if there were any books written by Indian authors which had similarly explored the Mahabharata from a perspective of historicity even though he knew there was a significant absence of archaeological and historical evidence for any of the events described in the epic.""But my search drew a blank. This was a field of study that no one seemed to have attempted to explore,"" Doyle said.It was then that he came across a fascinating book, ""The Hindu History"" by Akshoy K Majumdar, published in 1917, which contained a detailed study of the lineages and kingdoms of prehistoric India as described in the Vedas, The Mahabharata, The Ramayana, the Puranas and the Upanishads.""The analysis presented in this book intrigued me. Was it possible, I wondered, that there is a history of India that not popularly known but which has been captured in the scriptures of India in allegorical or narrative form. And if there is little known about these people of India from 6000 years ago, is it not possible that their knowhow of science and technology, as described in The Mahabharata, was forgotten as well,"" Doyle said.The lack of physical evidence and research into this area meant thathe could only explore these possibilities through fiction. That was where his interest in this genre began.""The Mahabharata Secret"" had been written as a stand alone and not as part of a series and given that 18 International literary agents and several Indian publishers rejected the manuscript before the book was published by Om Books in 2013, he was unsure of how the Indian audience would respond to the book.""However, the book was a runaway bestseller and there was a clamour for more books along the same lines,"" and it was then he began researching and writing ""The Mahabharata Quest"" series, releasing Book 1: ""The Alexander Secret in"" 2014 and Book 2: ""The Secret of the Druids"" in 2016.Speaking about his research, he said the foremost thing was to read The Mahabharata in its original form. He read the entire Mahabharata twice - all 100,000 shlokas - in two versions: the K M. Ganguli prose translation and the M N Dutt translation (a shloka by shloka translation).""I also spend considerable time researching the science behind every book in ï¿½The Mahabharata Quest' series. While the connection between the science and mythology is fictional, the science is all based on real, cutting edge scientific research. I read a lot of books, white papers on each scientific topic that I research and consult with international scientific experts to ensure that my facts are correct.""I do the same with the historical research. For each book that I write, I read maybe 100 or 150 books on science and history. I also have Sanskrit PhDs and reputed Vedic scholars who I consult to ensure that my interpretation of the shlokas is correct and credible,"" Doyle explained.Location research is also important. He travels to at least 90 per cent of the locations that feature in his books. This means a lot of travel since a lot of locations he visits don't eventually end up in a book.""But physically visiting a location helps me get an accurate feel for the place which enables me to paint a realistic and accurate picture in my books. For ï¿½The Secret of the Druids', for example, which links Irish and British mythology and the Mahabharata, I spent more thann five weeks in the UK, visiting over 50 ancient sites in the company of archaeologists to ensure that I got my facts right,"" Doyle said.How does he see the road ahead?In 2017, he realised that Book 3 in ""The Mahabharata Quest"" series was going to takeanother year or two, which meant that his readers would have to go without a book from him for perhaps two to three years.It was then that he decided to write ""The Pataala Prophecy"", a fantasy thriller series based on Indian mythology ï¿½ ""so that I could give my readers one book every year. (And I have managed that; with the exception of 2015 and 2017, I have released one book every year between 2013 and 2019 and I should be able to release one book in 2020 as well)"", Doyle said.Since he had already done almost all the mythological research that he needed for the new series (and there was no scientific or historical research required for a fantasy series), this series was easier and quicker to write and Book 1, ""Son of Bhrigu"", was published in 2018 and became an immediate bestseller. Book 2, ""The Mists of Brahma"" was published last October.""I now have my hands full with two series running simultaneously along with the research for ï¿½The Mahabharata Quest' series, so I don't see myself writing anything else apart from these series for the foreseeable future.""I expect to release Book 3 of ï¿½The Mahabharata Quest' series in 2020, after which there will be three more books in ""The Pataala Prophecy"" series and another one or two books more in ""The Mahabharata Quest"" series. Once both series are completed, I will look around for the theme of my next work,"" Doyle concluded.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74995414,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-193767/74995414.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/books/interviews/i-examine-the-mahabharata-from-scientific-perspective-christopher-doyle/articleshow/74993345.cms

LONDON: England football star Wayne Rooney has said that his lowest point came in the 2006 World Cup quarter-final game against Portugal , where he was sent off.

Rooney was given the marching orders after then Manchester United teammate and superstar Cristiano Ronaldo played a role in the dismissal, with the Portuguese caught winking after his Old Trafford colleague was dismissed for a second-half stamp.

""There was a clear foul, the former Chelsea defender Ricardo Carvalho was pulling and pushing me and Petit came in from the other side,"" Rooney wrote in his column for The Times as quoted by Goal.

""Referee Horacio Elizondo did nothing and I planted my foot down on Carvalho -- in one of those moments when you're not thinking.

""I knew it was a red card and back in the dressing room I watched the rest of the game on a little TV, thinking: 'If we win this, I'm suspended for a World Cup semi-final and final and if we lose it's my fault.' It was the worst, weirdest feeling I've had in football.

""I had my phone in my hand and I was getting all these messages about Ronaldo. Of course, when he ran over to ask Elizondo to send me off I pushed him away. At that moment I couldn't believe what he was doing. But sitting in that dressing room gave me time to calm down and think.

""I put myself in Ronaldo's shoes. Would I do the same? Probably. Would I be in the ref's face to make sure he got sent off? If he deserved the red, if it would help us win - yes, no question. I'd do it tomorrow. I thought: 'Actually, I tried to get him booked in the first half for diving.' And the wink thing, I didn't see anything in that at all. It was nothing.

""So I calmed down. I went over to him afterwards in the tunnel. I felt it was important to speak to him while it was still fresh and to do it face to face. He gave me a look as if to say sorry but by then I had my United head on. I said I've no issues with you. Enjoy your tournament and good luck. I'll see you in a few weeks and let's go try and win the league.""

England were knocked out on penalties after a goalless draw, with Frank Lampard , Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher all failing from 12 yards as Ronaldo converted the decisive penalty for a 3-1 victory.

The association said it also should be taken into account that the league has been temporarily suspended and not yet cancelled.The league and the players' association have been in talks to try to find ways to mitigate losses that could reach nearly 1 billion euros ($1.08 billion) if the season cannot be restarted because of the pandemic.The players said they agree with a salary reduction to help the clubs during the crisis, but not to the extent the league wants, which could amount to nearly half of the total losses if the competition is not resumed.Players said they want to keep negotiating directly with the clubs instead of being forced into furloughs.""The clubs and the players have been reaching agreements regarding the salaries,"" the players' association said. ""What footballers are not going to do is relinquish labor rights."" Barcelona and Atlético Madrid are among the Spanish clubs requesting furloughs, but both directly negotiated the amount of the salary reduction with players -- 70% in both cases. Both clubs and their players are contributing to guarantee the wages of non-playing employees being furloughed.The government furloughs help reduce the clubs' labor costs while also guaranteeing players their jobs once the crisis is over.Spain has more than 130,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with nearly 12,500 deaths. The nation is expected to remain in a lockdown until April 26.There is no timetable for the return of the Spanish league.Players maintained their position to only resume competing when health authorities deemed it safe for everyone's health, a view also shared by the Spanish league.The league has suggested it will recommend teams start mini-camp while the lockdown is still in place, if it's possible to do so within the restrictions imposed by authorities.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74995406,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-43677,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/football/top-stories/spanish-soccer-players-criticise-leagues-call-for-furloughs/articleshow/74995419.cms

CHANDIGARH: Taking serious note of private schools defying directions issued in wake of coronavirus outbreak, the Punjab government initiated action against five schools.

These schools were forcing parents to pay fees during the lockdown period. The education department has issued showcause notices to the erring parties - La Foundation School Sangrur, DAV Public School Bhupindra Road Patiala, Bhupindra International School Patiala, Delhi Public School Ludhiana , Angels Paradise School Amritsar and Mount Litera Zee School Faridkot – after receiving complaints from parents.

Punjab education minister Vijay Inder Singla said, “Showcause notices have been issued to the violators and they have been given seven-day time to file their reply. If they failed to give satisfactory reply, the department will cancel their affiliation.”

The education minister also cautioned other schools not to defy instructions and said that if any violation will come to light in future, the erring school would be sealed by the district magistrate before seeking any reply.

Singla said that the education department had issued an order March 23 directing schools to provide window period of at least 30 days for submission of fees after the situation gets normal. He said that the schools have also been directed not to charge any late fees or fine from the students for this period. He added that after the issuance of these orders, the schools were regularly being warned of strict action for defying the direction.

He asked parents to directly lodge complaints on his email vijayindersingla@gmail.com . Last month, the department had taken action against five private schools for defying government orders.

453,['5/04/2020'],5 tips for working parents to help them prioritize their sleep,"Raising children is the investment of a lifetime. They demand your constant attention and support. Sometimes, however, it gets difficult for parents to juggle between their work and children. Especially, if their kids are still young. Both your job and your child are responsibilities that cannot be compromised. So, parents usually end up compromising the amount of sleep they get. They tend to work late into the night if they have spent considerable time with their children during the day. For parents whose kids are still young also end up with disturbed sleep routines.Sleep is very important for the body to recoup and recover from the day. It gives you body time to heal and also perform some very important functions even while you sleep. If you are sleep deprived, you tend to be short-tempered and feel tired throughout the day, which ultimately affects your productivity at work and home and puts you in a vicious cycle. Here are five tips for you to help you get the required sleep that your body needs.As adults, we always wish to squeeze in one last task before we go to bed. We forget that a good night’s sleep actually leaves you energized the next day and you end up getting more work done. The recommended sleep for adults is seven to nine hours but you can gauge for yourself the amount of sleep you require to feel energized. Set a bedtime in accordance with the time you need to wake up. Creating a relaxing bedtime routine might be a good way to make sure you have a good night’s sleep.A consistent routine helps your body to sleep well easily and also stay asleep. It will give you high-quality sleep. You should also help your children form a routine. As enticing as it is, it is not advisable to make up for all the lost sleep on the weekends. It is in fact counterproductive. Sleeping in throws your body clock off. Your schedule should allow enough time for sleep on a daily basis.Blue light has the tendency to tell your body it is daytime which can mess with your sleep patterns. Gadgets like smartphones, computers and tablets emit blue light. You can use blue light filters or wear special glasses to keep out blue light. Instead, exposure to bright blue light in the morning is good for a productive day ahead.A big part of a good sleeping schedule is to give your body time to unwind which is impossible because of the constant urge to see that last text or last email before bed. We plan to scroll through our phone for only a few minutes, which get converted to hours before we even know it. It is. Therefore, advisable to keep your phone out of your room or on airplane mode if you have it with you.Stress is one of the major reasons for disturbed sleep. Ironically, we are almost always stressed about not being able to get enough sleep in the first place. Some nights of sleeplessness and poor sleep are inevitable. You should not stress about them, instead, be sure that your body can handle short sleep problems. Finding ways to relax and de-stress right before bed is a good way to make sure you sleep well.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74962987,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-244980/74962987.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/parenting/toddler-year-and-beyond/5-tips-for-working-parents-to-help-them-prioritize-their-sleep/articleshow/74963016.cms

No, we don’t mean wearing a green outfit; instead opt for a dose of Mother Nature at home! Create a lil green area with plants and pots. It’s okay if you don’t have much space at home. You can still do so with a windowsill plant. Here's how...- Pick out a spot that gets adequate sunlight for at least five hours a day.- Have individual pots for every herb.- Use a commercially-available potting mix and avoid garden soil as that is too heavy.- You can grow a variety of plants in the windowsill pot, but herbs are better suited to it. Opt for mint, dill, oregano, basil or thyme. You can also try your hand at growing chillies or cherry tomatoes.- To keep it neat, line the pot with plastic. This will avoid water seeping out from the bottom.- Provide as much water as the plant requires. It’s also a good idea to spray a mist on the plants every few days.- Prune or trim your herbs, which will help them to grow better.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74995513,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-244311/74995513.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/greentherapy-windowsill-plants-you-can-grow-at-home/articleshow/74995472.cms

464,['5/04/2020'],Sunday blackout: All your questions answered,"Are only domestic lights to be switched off or are street lights, common area lighting, essential services etc lights also to be switched off between 9 - 9:09 pm?

Only domestic home lights in the houses have to be put off voluntarily as appealed by our Hon'ble PM. It is again reiterated that no street lights, common area places, hospitals and other essential services have to switch off their lights. Are my domestic appliances safe during the said switching off of home lights?

All your domestic appliances will be safe. There is no need to switch off Fans, ACs, Fridges etc. Indian Electricity Grid is well designed to handle such kind of load variation and has several in- built levels of control and safety mechanisms to absorb any kind of frequency changes occuring due to such load variation. Thus, all the domestic appliances will be totally safe and hence should be kept in normal functioning mode as per the requirements. Whether adequate arrangements and protocols are in place to handle grid stability during lights out event on 5th April at 9:00 PM to 9.09pm?

Yes, all adequate arrangements and standard operating protocols are in place to maintain grid stability. Is it compulsory or voluntary to switch off lights?

Voluntary. As already said only domestic home lights have to be put off. Some apprehensions have been expressed that this may cause instability in the grid and fluctuation in voltage which may harm the electrical appliances.

These apprehensions are totally misplaced. These are normal phenomenon and the Indian Electricity Grid is well designed to handle such load variation and frequency changes as per standard operating protocols. Whether our grid management and technology deployed will withstand the fluctuation that light out may cause?

Indian electricity grid is robust and stable and employs state-of -art technology. It has in place necessary control and protective elements capable of handling such kind of fluctuations in demand at any instant of time. Whether appliances like fan, Refrigerators, AC, etc should be swiched off or kept in on mode?

All your domestic appliances would be safe. These appliances should be operated normally as per requirements by the consumers. No need at all to especially switch off at 9pm. Will street lights go off?

No. In fact, all states/UTs/ Local bodies have been advised to keep the street lights on for public safety. Will hospitals or other emergency and important installations face light out?

No, the lights in Hospitals and all other essential services like Public Utilities, Municipal Services, Offices, Police Stations, Manufacturing Facilities, etc will remain on. The call given by Hon'ble PM is to just switch off lights in residences. The load of home-lightings alone is around 20% of the total load. Would a sudden disconnect of 20% load not destabilise the grid? What measures will the Ministry take?

Domestic lighting load is much less than 20 per cent. Such kind of reduction in demand can be easily managed for which standard technical operating protocols are in place. Will there be load shedding? If yes what will be the impact?

No load shedding is planned.

466,['5/04/2020'],"Govt to initiate procurement of pulses during lockdown period, 13 states on board to help farmers","NEW DELHI: Ensuring procurement of gram and lentil during lockdown period, the Centre on Sunday approved a decision to procure these pulses from farmers on minimum support price (MSP) under its flagship ‘price support scheme’ in 13 states.

The move to procure these pulses by public sector food procurement agencies will help farmers in getting money in hands and maintaining the crucial supply chain of these farm produce during the lockdown period.

Under this approval, 25% of total produce of gram and lentil, amounting to Rs 1,250 crore, can be procured from 13 states including Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, West Bengal , Odisha, Jharkhand, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh , Assam, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. The Centre had in October last year fixed the MSP of gram and lentil at Rs 4,875 per quintal and Rs 4,800 per quintal, respectively for the 2020-21 Rabi marketing season.

“This crucial decision of procuring gram and lentil has been taken under price support scheme (PSS) without waiting for any formal proposal from these states,” said Union agriculture minister, Narendra Singh Tomar.

In normal situations, the Centre takes a call on procurement of pulses only after getting formal proposals from states.

Pulses are procured under the PSS by central nodal agencies with the proactive role of state governments. The procurement agencies include National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED) and Food Corporation of India (FCI). The expenditure and losses due to procurement is borne by the central government.

The Centre’s move on procurement of pulses is part of other measures which are being taken to ensure that the farmers can harvest their Rabi (winter sown) crops such as wheat, mustard, maize, millers and pulses and get money by selling it. The state-backed procurement at MSP will help farmers get remunerative prices of their produce when the normal functioning of agri markets got disrupted in many parts of the country during the lockdown period.

The home ministry had last week kept farming and procurement operations, and functioning of agri markets under exempted categories to allow farmers to continue with their agricultural operations during the lockdown period. Subsequently, it sent reminders to states this week, asking local authorities to allow these operations while maintaining social distancing.

It also urges clubs, leagues and players to reach ""appropriate collective agreements"".The guiding principles behind such deals should be to ""guarantee some form of salary payment to players and coaches, avoid litigation, protect contractual stability, and ensure clubs do not go bankrupt, while considering the financial impact of COVID-19 on clubs"".Crucially, the document states that where clubs and employees cannot reach agreement and where ""national law does not address the situation or collective agreements are not applicable"", unilateral decisions to change contracts ""will only be recognised when they are otherwise deemed reasonable"" by FIFA's Dispute Resolutions Chamber or Players Status Committee.A ""reasonable"" contractual change will take into account the economic situation of a club, the proportionality of any salary amendment and the net income of the employee after that amendment, FIFA writes in the document.FIFA will also take into account whether the decision applies to the entire squad or only specific employees, and whether the club attempted in good faith to reach a mutual agreement with its employees.The FIFA document summarising the working group's views will be submitted to the Bureau of the FIFA Council for approval.A FIFA spokesman said it was not in a position to comment as a proposal was being made to the Council, and ""we cannot preempt that decision"".The coronavirus working group is composed of representatives from across the game including the FIFA administration, confederations, national federations, the European Club Association (ECA), players union FIFPRO and the World Leagues Forum.The group also offered an alternative approach in which ""all agreements between clubs and employees should be 'suspended' during any suspension of competitions provided proper insurance coverage is maintained, and adequate alternative income support arrangements can be found for employees during the period in question.""The group agreed that transfer windows should be adjusted to reflect the changed dates of seasons, with priority given to teams finishing the current season with their existing squad.FIFA has also ruled that planned new restrictions on loan deals will not come into effect until the end of the current period of uncertainty surrounding the game due to the pandemic.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74995787,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-275519,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/football/top-stories/fifa-draws-up-guidelines-to-tackle-pay-cut-complaints/articleshow/74995745.cms

Here's how to live in 'real time',"A couple of days into lockdown, Mondays have started to look a lot like Sundays, and Tuesdays like Fridays, and Thursdays, well... you get the drift. Suddenly, weekends and weekdays seem like meaningless human constructs and time, merely an illusion. The things is, when you stay awake till 4 am (without even realising its 4 am) you start wondering why dinners can’t be breakfasts, and vice versa. So, why is this happening, and how do we make it stop?According the US national sleep foundation, sleep is regulated by two body systems: sleep/wake homeostasis, and the circadian biological clock, which responds to light and dark signals. Just like how jet lag can affect one’s sleep patterns adversely – due to the sudden shift in time zones and light cues – keeping odd hours during lockdown, not following a schedule and too much time indoors, can also impact body clock, as well as sleep.‘Sit with a calendar, and a timetable to chalk out a plan. Factor in points such as how many hours are you working, exercising and spending time with family, as well as what time you are eating and sleeping, to maintain order,’ says Dr Kavita.Prevent yourself from overworking, oversleeping, or binge-watching extra hours. Set alarmson your phone to remind you when to wrap up work or to have your lunch/dinner. Take little breaks,” says Shyam Sundar, a life coach, from Bengaluru.“Taking a break from smartphone/social media will give you time to introspect and design a productive day, and also keep you from staying up late and disrupting your sleep pattern,” says Dr Kavita.:Having fun activities to look forward to can help you tell apart your Mondays from your Sundays.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74995563,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-882330/74995563.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/lockdown-losing-track-of-time-heres-how-to-live-in-real-time/articleshow/74995189.cms

A source well-informed about the developments on this issue told PTI that the high profile media company had sent an apology after the PCB raised the issue of the rights being sold to the betting company 'Bet 365' without its knowledge.

The issue became a cause of embarrassment for the PCB as betting or gambling in any form is illegal in the country.

""The fact is that PCB became aware that the PSL matches were being live streamed by Bet 365 on its website as soon as the league started on 20th February,"" the source said.

He said on February 23 or 24, the PCB sent an email to its media rights partner pointing out that it had breached the contract between them by subletting the live streaming rights without informing or getting clearance from the Board as was required in the agreement.

""Later on, the media rights partner also sent an email to the PCB apologising for their mistake and admitted they were at fault in the entire issue.""

He said the Board also wrote directly to the betting company on March 1 or 2 to inform that the PCB would be taking legal action against it ( Bet365 ) if it did not stop the live streaming of matches immediately.

""The PCB informed the betting company that it was given live streaming rights without its (PCB's) knowledge which was a must under the contract they had with their media rights partner,"" the source added.

He said immediately after getting the PCB's mail, the betting company stopped live streaming of the matches around March 3.

The source said the impression created in the media that the PCB was unaware about the live streaming of matches on the website of a betting company until the PSL was coming to an end was incorrect.

They had a hold (on its exports) …they have1.5 billion people. I said I would appreciate it if they release the amounts we had ordered.

On Saturday, he went so far as to say he ""may take it too.""Although there are anecdotal accounts of the drug being effective and one survey of physicians listed it as the top line of treatment given the lack of alternatives in countering Covid-19 infections, Trump’s own expert team has been cautious about backing the President’s amateur enthusiasm.""The two leaders agreed to remain in touch on the issue of global supply chains for critical pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and to ensure they continue to function as smoothly as possible during the global health crisis,"" the White House said in a readout of the call.Prime Minister Modi confirmed Trump’s call with his own tweet that was more generic and tactful about their conversation, saying, ""Had an extensive telephone conversation with President @realDonaldTrump. We had a good discussion, and agreed to deploy the full strength of the India-US partnership to fight Covid-19.""Trump’s India outreach comes amid reports of Washington literally hijacking medical supplies contracted to other countries to US, and using it domestic laws to force US companies manufacturing abroad to renege their global contracts and attend first to US domestic need. Many top U.S and western drug companies such as Pfizer, Merck, GlaxoSmithKline have major presence in India through subsidiaries, although the anti-malarial drug that the U.S President has been espousing passionately is mass manufactured by home-grown pharma majors such as IPCA, Lupin, Sun Pharma and others.But Indian drug majors have had a tortured relationship with the US FDA, with credible reports of shoddy processes and ineffective medications forcing them to clean up their act amid some grumbling about how global pharma giants feel threatened by their ramping up generic drug production and distribution.

KAPURTHALA: Rail Coach Factory (RCF) Kapurthala has manufactured a prototype ventilator 'JEEVAN' within a week, that has an original design and will cost much less than what a regular ventilator cost. The ventilator prototype will now go for final testing at the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) before being put to production to aid the country's fight against COVID-19.

Conceptualized by RCF General Manager Ravinder Gupta after receiving instructions from the Railway Board for ‘exploring the possibilities of making ventilators’, the prototype has been now tested by the in-house medical professionals of RCF Hospital and they have given it a go-ahead.

The body of the ventilator prototype has been made from rail coach components and using in-house capacities. “The argon flow meter is taken from a laser welding machine and the compressor is from an air cooler. Team RCF needed to source just two parts - a regulator valve and a micro processor from vendors in Delhi and Noida. In the midst of the lockdown, RCF used emergency transit services to get the two components by road and train,” said a RCF spokesperson.

A team of engineers from Plant, Mechanical & Electrical Design, IT and a group of medical professionals of RCF Hospital and Stores Dept worked on it for the culmination of the prototype of ventilator.

Meanwhile, Gupta said: “ The ventilator is very silent, and it is not reverse engineering, but it is an original design from scratch. It will be submitted to ICMR for testing and validation and hopefully, it will be a saviour of lives amidst these hard times. The cost will be under Rs 10,000 without the compressor unit. Overall, the cost will still be a fraction of what regular ventilators available in the market cost. It can be used as an emergency ventilator. Production is easy and can be done with locally sourced components.”

“The heart of the device is the compressed air container to work the Ambu bag with air without any moving parts like servo motor or piston or link mechanism. It has a microprocessor­ based controller and the circuit has been designed by the RCF team. A valve has been installed to regulate the breathing of the patient whether young or old. This ventilator can be optimized to more compact size by using small size components,” RCF spokesperson said.

RCF is preparing the technical documents for perusal of the ICMR. Very soon, the prototype will be sent there for testing as per instructions of the Railway Board, the spokesperson added.
