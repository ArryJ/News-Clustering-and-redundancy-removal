0,['30/08/2020'],Losliya signs a crime action thriller as her next,"Looks like Bigg Boss Tamil girl Losliya is on a signing spree. Even as she is awaiting her debut vehicle Friendship (starring Harbhajan Singh ) to hit screens, we hear she has signed a couple of films in Kollywood. Among them is an yet-to-be-titled film, which will be directed by debutant JM Raja Saravanan Raja, an independent filmmaker, says, “I have been a part of the industry for several years now and have worked on scripts, but never officially assisted anyone. I have been writing since I was in Class 11. So, for me, script matters. When I approached producer Dilli Babu sir with this script, he instantly agreed to back it and gave me complete freedom to execute it. It’s a crime action thriller, and the two lead characters — played by Losliya and debutant K Pooranesh — are author-backed ones. We have been auditioning for the lead role since the last few months and Pooranesh, who has a theater background, was just apt. Losliya has an instant connect with the audience and fit the character perfectly. There will be a host of supporting cast, which we are currently finalising.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77825223,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-789887/77825223.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/losliya-signs-a-crime-action-thriller-as-her-next/articleshow/77825223.cms
1,['30/08/2020'],"Politics: No; Cinema: Maybe; Spirituality: Oh yeah, says Ramya","It is truly amazing how despite her absence from the silver screen for a few years now, the faintest murmurs about Ramya send her fans into a tizzy, wondering when she is going to make comeback. Naturally, when she resurfaced on social media after a brief hiatus and began interacting with members of the film fraternity, people began speculating if a return to cinema is on the cards. So, we caught up with Ramya for a video chat to get her to set the record straight. “I took time off from social media to concentrate on my mental and physical well-being,” says Ramya, adding, “Life is all about balance, though. You cannot cut off completely. I have done this in the past and I did it again after I resigned as the social media in-charge for a political party. I would recommend this to everyone, to take a break from what you are doing to pause and reflect. To gain wisdom, one has to look inward.”As it turns out, spirituality is what has caught Ramya ‘s fancy now, with the actress now reflecting on life a lot more. “I have been doing a Vedanta e-learning course since March. It is a three-year course. It gives me more meaning and purpose in life. I enjoy this more than the life that I have led,” she says.Does that mean she has bid adieu to politics ? “I am very driven by what the party I was associated with stands for and will forever be a liberal. But will I be actively involved in the party? No.”Is she looking at getting back to doing films then? “I wish I could say yes, because that would make many people happy. I have been approached for a film, but I am yet to give it any thought. Frankly, I am sort of over it. But at the moment, I would rather say, let's see, because if I say no, a lot of people will be disappointed. And in life, there's this fact that you never say never,” says Ramya.One other aspect of her life that always piques the interest of people is her relationship status, and in the past few years, there have been rumours of marriage and more. Is there any truth to it? “No, I’m not married. Society is so predictable; if a woman is of a certain age she has to be married. But these rumours are so exciting, while my life is very dull.” As we wind up the conversation, we cannot help but remark just how much more measured Ramya is these days in what she says and does than what she used to be. “I used to be so moophat. I would not think and just say things. But that was my state of mind then and this is me today. I think back then I was very immature and childish and politics helped open my mind,” she opines.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77826775,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-2022629/77826775.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/politics-no-cinema-maybe-spirituality-oh-yeah-says-ramya/articleshow/77826799.cms

The recent breakthrough drug raid by the city police has implied that members of the Kannada film industry are allegedly under the radar for being clients. Over the past few days, filmmaker Indrajit Lankesh has spoken extensively about how a cross-section of people in the industry are involved in substance abuse. He went on record to state that it is only a section of people in the industry that are involved in substance abuse. ““I have heard about the use of drugs among people from many close quarters, and I know that there are at least 20-25 names in this circuit,” he told us during a video interview, adding, “But this doesn’t imply that everyone in the industry is into drugs. No one should taint the industry. We need to ensure those who are involved in this are reprimanded and corrected,” he said. The director also mentioned that the city police commissioner’s office has sent him a letter, asking him to share information about this, to which, he says, he will whole-heartedly oblige. Indrajit also stressed that there can be a greater involvement from the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce in terms of being strict with those who lack discipline. ""When news of honey traps or drug involvement makes headlines, they can call the ones whose names make headlines to ensure they get a warning to maintain decorum in the industry,"" he added.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77826950,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-128879/77826950.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/indrajit-lankesh-says-that-not-everyone-in-the-industry-is-into-drugs/articleshow/77826950.cms

6,['30/08/2020'],"GST Compensation: Non-BJP states unhappy with GST relief plan, may forge joint strategy","NEW DELHI: The Centre on Saturday circulated two options for states to borrow and meet the GST shortfall , which will be repaid via an extension of the compensation cess beyond the June 2022 deadline. The proposal, however, did not find the support of all states. Most states not ruled by BJP plan to meet on Monday to formulate a common strategy opposing the plan.In line with the deliberations at the GST Council meeting earlier this week, the finance ministry has proposed that states be allowed to borrow Rs 97,000 crore against an estimated shortfall of Rs 3 lakh crore between April 2020 and January 2021. The shortfall is due to implementation-related issues.Under this option, the entire principal and interest will be paid out of the compensation cess on cars, soft drinks, pan masala, tobacco and coal, which will be extended beyond the current deadline of June 2022. States that opt for this will get loans at a specially arranged rate and the debt will not be added to their balance sheet, giving them room to borrow more in the coming years.Under the second option, where the total borrowing has been pegged at Rs 2.35 lakh crore (with Rs 65,000 crore flowing from the cess this year), states will have to borrow from the market, which means the cost will be higher. More importantly, those that opt for this route will have to bear the entire interest burden as only the principal payment will be covered by the cess and they will give up on the borrowing headroom.“None of the states should have a problem, we are honouring the commitment that former finance minister Arun Jaitley had given. The first option will allow states to get the benefits of cess when the loan is repaid,” a Union government functionary told TOI.Some of the BJP-ruled states indicated their willingness to back the first option. “We are studying the proposal, but prima-facie option one is beneficial to states. We must also bear in mind that it is not just state finances that have been hit by Covid-19, even the Centre has to bear the stress. There are also other requirements such as higher defence spending,” Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Modi said over phone from Patna.Opposition-ruled states want the Centre to take over the debt burden, arguing that they have much lower headroom to either borrow or service it. Besides, they argue that the Centre can raise funds at a cheaper rate.“I am not in favour of states having to borrow. The Centre is pressuring states to borrow. We will take a call on Monday,” Chattisgarh minister T S Singh Deo, who represents the state in the GST Council, told TOI.Given the differences, the issue is expected to be back in the GST Council soon for a final decision.“The Central government’s position is that any compensation to states will only come through compensation cess unless the GST Council decides otherwise. However, if states opt for the Rs 2.35 lakh crore option, only the principal will come out of compensation cess. Given this, states will perhaps decide on the option depending on their situation and revenue projection. It’s not clear as to what the GST Council will decide if a few states go for Option 1 and others for Option 2,” said Pratik Jain, who leads the indirect tax practice at consulting firm PwC.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77828303,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60594,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/non-bjp-states-unhappy-with-gst-relief-plan-may-forge-joint-strategy/articleshow/77828328.cms
7,['30/08/2020'],Naga pact soon as govt believes it can bypass NSCN(IM),"The long-pending Naga framework agreement is set to be formalised soon irrespective of whether or not National Socialist Council of Nagaland leader T Muivah is part of the peace deal as the Centre feels it has adequate backing of other armed groups and the influential Nagaland Gaon Bura Federation.

Muivah's insistence on Nagaland getting a ""flag and constitution"" has held up the formal end of the political discussions , which have not concluded despite a ceasefire agreement signed by the Centre and NSCN as far back as 1997. The current framework agreement was signed in 2015 with the NSCN agreeing to accept that Nagaland was part of the Indian union. But the aging leader runs a serious risk of being left stranded as the Centre is pressing ahead with its plan to sign a peace agreement with other groups as well as civil society.

A statement directly critical of NSCN issued on Friday by Gaon Bura assumes significance in view of reports of differences between Naga groups and the Centre's interlocutor and Nagaland governor R N Ravi. ""There is a perpetual tendency within NSCN(IM) leadership to brand Naga leaders, tribes, organisations, other civil societies as anti-Nagas and traitors for not toeing their political ideology. This is a mockery of Nagaland for Christ.""

Backing Ravi's role, the Gaon Bura said, ""NGBF observes that the demand for replacement of interlocutor is unjust and untenable due to the fact that he is also the GOI interlocutor with other negotiating groups.""

A top source said reports of the peace process running into rough weather are part of the NSCN's ""negotiating tactics"" and do not represent the actual situation. ""It has been made clear to Muivah that the demands for a flag and constitution will not be accepted and it is time for him to make up his mind,"" the source said.

""Muivah's obstruction were helped because a whole set of players developed a vested interest in the conflict industry represented by the longest-running insurgency. That phase is over and we are ready to call his bluff if he does not come around,"" said a senior source, adding that time is running out fast for the Naga insurgent.

After the 2015 framework agreement, formalisation of the peace pact dragged on as NSCN raised several issues. As progress was slow, the Centre widened the ambit of negotiations to include smaller armed groups and the NGBF, which represented tribes in Nagaland as compared to Muivah who is a Tangkhul Naga from Manipur . Resentment over NSCN leader's recalcitrance runs deep even among his ranks, claimed sources.

The Centre is basing its confidence on action taken over recent months to ensure that NSCN armed commanders and cadre are largely confined to camps and do not carry on with their ""parallel government."" The Bura federation, which represents Nagaland tribes and hundreds of village heads, is keen to settle the issue without further delay as it wants a formal end to the militancy.

The source said that NSCN armed cadre is also not so enthused over a return to a full-fledged armed struggle with a section understood to be in touch with the Centre. It is the Centre's understanding that Muivah, while seeing the lack of support for more struggle, is exploring the possibility of dragging on matters given the ""de facto"" influence he has enjoyed in the state.

When Bombay Times got in touch with veteran filmmaker Ramesh Sippy , whose father GP Sippy was a film producer, and whose son Rohan has also made films like ' Kuch Naa Kaho ', 'Bluffmaster!', 'Dum Maaro Dum' and ' Nautanki Saala ', he said, “Nepotism exists all over the world, in every business. If my father belonged to a particular profession — be it a doctor or a lawyer — I am not denying that the youngsters of my family will always have an advantage. They can avail the benefit of our experience. However, in the end, it will give you a stepping stone and nothing more than that. Whether it is films or any other field, if you don’t have the acumen or talent, nepotism doesn’t help. It’s a fact that not every star kid has been successful.”He added, “People feel that film families always have an advantage. But, it is only an advantage, not a handover.”Meanwhile, the filmmaker, who has directed one of India’s best-known classics, ' Sholay ', is currently celebrating 45 years of the film. When asked why the movie, after all these years, has not lost its magic, he replied, “Sholay' is one film that has stood out. It is difficult to explain how it became a cult movie, because had I known the formula, I would have done it all over again. I have made good films before and after 'Sholay', too, but it is not easy to explain a phenomenon. Everything just fell in place for the film.

9,['30/08/2020'],Sharad Malhotra: Missed band-baaja during Ganpati visarjan,"For nine years, Sharad Malhotra celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi with lots of masti and naach-gaana. But this year, even though the festive spirit was the same, the celebrations, he says, were quieter. “It was the first time I did Ganpati visarjan at home. I’ve always done that at the beaches, where we dance and get into the feel with the gang; the band- baaja, gaana-bajaana was missing this year. We also didn’t invite many people, considering the pandemic. Even my parents were not there. This is Ripci's (Sharad's wife Ripci Bhatia ) second Ganesh Chaturthi with me. Last year, her parents were with us, too. So, all of that was missing. It was a quieter celebration, but everything else remained the same. We followed all the rituals, and we were both extremely gung-ho about handling everything together,” he tells us.In his career spanning over 15 years, Sharad has always played a quintessential hero on TV, but the actor has now turned negative for ' Naagin 5'.Sharad says, “When I was told I’ll be playing the bad boy, I was like, ‘Hello, who has the guts to offer me that?’ I was literally scared on the first day of the shoot – I had cold feet and my hands were sweating. It was honestly like a la-la land for me. I am used to talking and walking like a hero (laughs) and suddenly, being the bad boy was a shocker. This character is mean and evil and doing such a role was difficult for me as I’ve always played those sanskaari types of characters – a caring son, a loving husband – or a strong warrior. I’ve always been in the positive light. But this character is crazy. I am still a little apprehensive about it.”So what made him say yes? He explains, “In my last few interviews, I had mentioned I want to do something different, something edgy, but nobody paid heed to that. But Ekta ma’am ( Ekta Kapoor ) had that vision, that trust in me. And now the audience is in shock because nobody expected me to play such a character. I play an icchadhari cheel (a shape-shifting eagle). I never imagined myself flying around like that (laughs). Having said that, I haven’t seen the kind of fan following, adulation and viewership 'Naagin' has for any fantasy fiction show. All the seasons of the show have done extremely well. It is the fifth season, so when you have something tried and tested, the nod automatically comes.”The actor, who started shooting for the show recently, admits that it hasn’t been easy being on the set amid the pandemic. “I was a little scared about stepping out during such a time, the fear is still there. You have so many people around, of course not as much as we used to have before, but it’s still scary. Thankfully, the production has taken very good care of us. They have been sanitising the set every 30 minutes, and temperature checks are happening frequently. We are following all protocols on the set. By the grace of God, everything is going great,” he says, adding, “I’m cautious about everything. I’m carrying home-cooked food, my own water, my own bed sheet and pillows on the set with me. I also make sure my makeup artists and staff are following protocols and are not mingling with too many people on the set. It is unfortunate, but this is the need of the hour.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77829239,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1155628/77829239.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/sharad-malhotra-this-year-ganpati-spirits-were-the-same-but-festivities-quieter/articleshow/77819879.cms

12,['30/08/2020'],Arjun Bijlani: A happy and talented guy like Sushant Singh Rajput just disappeared from our lives,"It’s been over two months since Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Bandra residence, but his friend and former neighbour, TV actor Arjun Bijlani , is yet to come to terms with the fact. Arjun and Sushant were neighbours till about five years ago, when the latter moved out of the apartment, which he shared with his then girlfriend Ankita Lokhande . Shaken by Sushant’s sudden demise, Arjun had tweeted a few days ago, “Can’t stop thinking what happened to Sushant. God pl punish the real culprits (sic).”While there are various theories doing the rounds about the actor’s death, initially, it was alleged that nepotism in Bollywood had driven him to take the extreme step. However, Arjun doesn’t think so. “Sushant was a happy-go-lucky guy, and we used to regularly discuss work. In fact, we have had many discussions on competition, various film projects and how we, as outsiders, can also make it in films. He would always say that it never bothered him that he was not from a filmi family. He used to tell me that these things are trivial and he would fight against all odds to achieve his dreams. So, I really don’t feel that he would (allegedly) commit suicide because of such reasons,” he says.There are also speculations that Sushant was grappling with depression. Ask Arjun about it and he replies, “Sushant was not someone who would get depressed over things. Also, during our friendship, I never found him grappling with mentalhealth issues.” Arjun adds, “He was also not someone who would be bogged down by financial concerns. So, I am baffled by the multiple theories that are floating about Sushant’s death. I sincerely want the real reason behind his death to come out. A happy, promising and talented guy like Sushant just disappeared from our lives! We all need to know what happened. I am happy that the CBI ( Central Bureau of Investigation ) is investigating this and we all hope to get closure soon. ”Arjun regrets the fact that over the years, Sushant and he lost touch. He recalls how he never got any response to his last message to Sushant. “I don’t remember exactly when I met him last. Maybe at some party with a bunch of friends, at least a year ago. But I do remember thinking of him on May 29 and texting him, because I wanted to know how he was doing. However, I never received any reply. The next news I heard about him was on June 14, that he had died by suicide. Later, I came to know that in the last year, he had changed his number several times and therefore, my message never reached him,” he shares.So, how did they lose touch? “Well, he moved to Bandra and got busy with films. We never really lost touch. We used to bump into each other at parties. But, we both got busy with work.

The country has recorded 4,96,070 cases in seven days while going from a caseload of 30 lakh to 35 lakh, at an average of 70,867 cases per day. This is the highest number recorded during a seven-day period in the world, higher than the US’s worst spikes in the latter half of July.The India numbers are collated daily by TOI from state government data while the US figures are based on ourworldindata.org.The record addition of fresh cases on Saturday was in no small measure due to a massive rise in cases in Maharashtra , which reported as many as 16,867 fresh infections. This was a huge jump from the state’s previous highest of 14,888 recorded on August 26.Other states which reported high numbers on Saturday were Andhra Pradesh (10,548, above 10,000 for the fourth day), Karnataka (8,324, above 8,000 for five days), Tamil Nadu (6,352) and Uttar Pradesh (5,684).

Six accused have been arrested and one of them was shot on his leg as he tried to attack the police and escape.The six accused had hatched a plan and abducted the boy in an attempt to extort aof Rs. 2 crore from his father, who runs a garment store in Bharathinagar, the police said. The police team had to open fire at the main accused, Mohammed Zain, who tried to escape from a house in Shampura where the police surrounded him on Friday night.The boy was reunited with his family in the presence of the city police commissioner Kamal Pant on Saturday. The other arrested are Fahim, Muzammil, Faizan, Shaheed and Khaleel. The accused live near the businessman’s house in Shivajinagar, the police said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (East Division) SD Sharanappa said Zain, a resident of Shivajinagar, was a regular visitor at the garment showroom in. “He hatched a plot of kidnap and roped in his friends and decided to abduct the owner’s youngest son for a huge ransom,” Sharanappa said.For roughly a month, the gang of six kept a watch on the movements of the businessman and his family members. They watched his house and shop and learnt about all the family’s routines.On August 27, Zain approached the boy as he was alone outside his house and lured him with a promise of buying him kites. “Zain knew that the boy was fascinated with kite flying, and he readily agreed to accompany him,” said Sharanappa. Zain took the boy to his car and offered him a cold drink laced with sedatives. He took the boy and drove to the outskirts and asked his friends to take over. They drove the boy to a house in Tumakuru while Zain came back to Shampura and again kept a watch on the businessman’s movements, the police said. The accused also dropped a note at the businessman’s shop stating that they had kidnapped his son and they demanded a ransom of Rs 2 crore for his safe release. The harried businessman approached the police and narrated his ordeal.On Thursday evening, a special team led by ACP Tabarak Fathima tracked down one of the abductors and detained three of his friends in the city to learn about their movements. Another team led by police inspector Sirajuddin tracked down the others using call record details and traced their car to Tumakuru. A team that reached the house in Tumakuru where the boy was confined, learnt that the accused had been alerted and had begun travelling with the boy in a car. The police spotted the car and went on a hot pursuit for 15 kilometres during which the abductors’ car driver lost control and met with an accident. The boy was rescued unharmed from the vehicle.

The 62-year-old Annasaheb Magar Hospital run by(PMC) inwas supposed to be a COVID care centre (CCC), considering the huge number of coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) patients in the area.However, in July, the health authority of PMC was forced to shift the venue in a municipal school which was much less equipped. The reason for this was Pune police refusing to vacate the hospital premises it has occupied for a couple of years, opening a crime branch office there.Now, PMC has issued a notice to Pune police, demanding that they vacate the place as it has a plan to create a. However, the crime branch has refused to vacate, saying they cannot move at the time of the pandemic.The police have occupied a major portion of the hospital and started a Unit-V office of the crime branch on temporary basis till the construction of their own building on a vacant land spread over 30,000 sq ft . However, despite repeated letters to vacate, the police refused to shift and have postponed the plan to construct their own building.Chetan Tupe, the local corporator of the area, has raised the issue with the municipal commissioner and district collector, alleging that the police have illegally occupied the hospital.Tupe, in his complaint, also mentioned that the hospital structure might come crashing down any moment due to a major leakage issue. On other end, the renovated part of the hospital is occupied by the crime branch. Talking to Mirror, Tupe said, “PMC has sent the notice to the cops, but they are behaving against the law. Without any compensation, they have been using the premises for years. Because of their presence, PMC cannot redevelop the land, nor are they able to expand the hospital as a COVID facility,” he added.Pune police have other locations to relocate, including designated land near Vitthalrao Tupe auditorium, land near the flyover and the current Hadapsar police station building. Funds were also given by the district collector under the District Planning and Development Committee (DPDC) scheme. However, they still refuse to move. “This is nothing but an encroachment on civic land. We have also communicated this to home minister,” Tupe said.Dr Ramchandra Hankare, health chief of PMC, said, “We have issued eviction notices to the police as we are in the process of starting a dedicated COVID hospital for the locality with a dense population. This east suburb has no major hospitals, therefore modern hospitals are required.”Ashok Morale, additional police commissioner (crime), said, “We are aware about the issue. After COVID-19 pandemic, we will shift to another place. However, at this time, it won’t be feasible. We will convey to the higher authorities to expedite the procedure.”The Magar hospital was built in 1956 and is one of the first few civic-run medical facilities in the city. At present, people from marginal income groups from Ramtekdi, Vaiduwadi, Gosavi Vasti, Shinde Vasti, Malwadi, Sasane Nagar, Vetal Baba Vasahat, Pandhare Mala, Manjari andare taking benefit of its outdoor patient department (OPD).",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-1304610,msid-77828988/77828988.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-tells-cops-to-leave-hospital-in-hadapsar/articleshow/77830070.cms
18,['30/08/2020'],Govt revives 2-year PG medical diploma courses,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: With an aim to address the shortage of specialists in district hospitals and in rural India, the health ministry has allowed two year postgraduate (PG) diploma courses that applicants can pursue after completing their MBBS.

This will enable National Board of Examination to start eight postgraduate speciality diploma courses in obstetrics and gynaecology , anaesthesiology, paediatrics, tuberculosis and chest disease, family medicine, ophthalmology, radio diagnosis, and ENT. The health ministry issued the order after consultation with the board of governors in suppression of the Medical Council of India .

Candidates can pursue these courses by clearing the NEET-PG exam after completing MBBS. Hospitals with a minimum of 100 operational beds are eligible to seek accreditation with NBE for the diploma courses. TOI had reported about this proposal being considered by the government in March.

The move assumes significance in view of the pandemic which has restricted movement because of fear of infection. The dearth of specialist doctors in rural and remote areas have become more challenging for the healthcare system. The Medical Council of India had in 2019 converted its diploma courses into degree courses to overcome the shortfall of teaching faculty.

20,['30/08/2020'],"17 states say no to SC’s quota within quota poser, 5 ‘yes’; major ones mum","NEW DELHI: As the Supreme Court sets the stage to re-examine the possibility of sub-categorisation of SCs/STs, as many as 17 states have categorically rejected the Centre’s proposal for sub-division of Dalits, while only five states have responded positively.

Since June 2011, the Centre has been pursuing the states to see if a way could be found around the Supreme Court’s E V Chinnaiah judgment of 2004 which ruled sub-division of Dalits as unconstitutional.

Following a UPA cabinet decision, the social justice ministry had fielded the issue to states. Sources said the exercise is still on since “six major states and UTs which constitute nearly half of the SC population in the country have not yet responded.” The last reminder to these states which include Dalit strongholds of UP, Bihar, Maharashtra besides Puducherry and Jammu & Kashmir, was sent in December, 2019.

Interestingly, five states which have given nod to the Centre’s proposal include the ones which undertook the exercise before it was struck down following the Chinnaiah judgment — Punjab, Haryana and Tamil Nadu — besides Rajasthan.

After 16 years, an SC bench on Thursday marked a major departure from the Chinnaiah judgment by ruling that sub-categorisation of SCs/STs can not only be done, but can also be undertaken by the states. The government is taking stock of the issue in the wake of SC’s Thursday order.

Sub-categorisation means division of SCs into sub-groups and apportioning of reservation quota among them based on their population. The idea is devised to address the complaint that some affluent sub-castes are cornering the quota benefits.

Under pressure from then united Andhra Pradesh whose sub-categorisation policy was overturned by the Chinnaiah order, the UPA government had formed Justice Usha Mehra Commission to examine the issue.

The panel had in its report in 2008 concluded that sub-categorisation was not permissible under present norms but could be enabled through a Constitutional amendment to Article 341 providing for sub-categorisation and by empowering the Parliament to undertake it.

While the controversial 2011 government attempt is stuck, the apex court’s Thursday order declaring sub-categorisation as legal has reopened the subject which will now be examined by a seven-judge bench.As and when it happens, the order would be watched not only for if it can be done under present circumstances but if it can be done at all. The Usha Mehra panel had said it could not be done under present norms but could be done through constitutional amendments. It was a major leap from the Chinnaiah judgement which ruled that it was a completely ‘no-go’ area.

21,['30/08/2020'],Govt mulls single voters list for polls at all levels,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Moving towards adoption of a single electoral roll for polls at all levels – parliamentary, assembly and local – the Narendra Modi government has begun discussions on the enabling legal changes that may be required. Sources told TOI that a recent meeting comprising senior officials of PMO and Election Commission of India (ECI) decided that the Cabinet secretary would hold talks with the state chief secretaries to persuade them to make relevant changes in their own state laws governing local body polls, to allow adoption of ECI rolls for panchayat/municipal elections.

While ECI is empowered by Article 324 of the Constitution to hold polls to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies, for which a common ECI voter list is used, SECs derive their powers from Article 243K and 243ZA to prepare rolls for local body polls. However, SECs of almost 22 states are known to rely on ECI rolls for conduct of third-tier polls, thanks to an enabling provision in their relevant state laws.

A senior EC officer said the single voters’ list suggestion of the poll panel dates back to the 1999 and that it would not be correct to link it to another pending proposal of the government for simultaneous polls. “As far as simultaneous polls are concerned, all bodies -- the Law Commission, parliamentary standing committee and NITI Aayog -- that have studied and made recommendations on the issue, have confined themselves to examining simultaneous polls to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies. They did not go into the simultaneous polls to the third tier – local bodies – at all,” said a government officer.

Law Commission in its draft report on simultaneous polls released in August 2018, had stated: “So far as the third-tier institutions are concerned, their number is too large and conduct of election to the same is primarily a State subject. As per the Constitution, the elections to the third tier institutions are directed and controlled by their respective State Election Commissions. Therefore, it would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, to synchronise and align election schedules of third-tier with that of the House of the People and State Legislative Assemblies”.

At the meeting comprising the Cabinet secretary and representatives of the PMO, law ministry, panchayati raj and EC held a few days back, two options – first, a Constitutional amendment to Article 243K and Article 243ZA to make it mandatory for SECs to adopt ECI rolls and second, getting states where ECI voters list is not in use currently, to enable the same by revising their own relevant Acts, were discussed. The consensus favoured the latter.

“The meeting agreed that the remaining states can be persuaded to make the relevant revision in their laws, though this would have to be totally voluntary. Since EC has no jurisdiction over the SECs, the Cabinet secretary has been asked to bring the states on board”.

While BJP manifesto for 2019 Lok Sabha poll had promised simultaneous polls to all three tiers of government, no discussion has been held within the government or Law Commission yet on including the third tier in the scope of simultaneous polls. Even an all-party called by the Prime Minister last year on the subject had limited itself to discussing synchronized LS and assembly polls.

23,['30/08/2020'],Measles vaccine holding back India’s full immunisation,"The poor coverage of measles vaccination and later doses of basic vaccines like those for polio, diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) are pulling down the proportion of fully immunised children. This indicates a poor mechanism to track children already registered in the immunisation system despite a Mother and Child Tracking System (MCTS) being in place since 2009.

A recently released NSO report on health for 2017-18 shows that from over 94% coverage for the BCG vaccine given at birth, coverage fell to just 67% for the measles vaccine, given between 9-12 months, the poorest coverage among all basic vaccines needed for a child to be counted as being fully immunised.

Similarly, from 94% coverage of the oral polio vaccine’s (OPV) birth dose, the coverage went down with every subsequent dose to reach 80% by the third dose. The DPT vaccine coverage went from 91% coverage for the first shot given at six weeks to 78% by the third shot at 14 weeks. This meant that India’s proportion of fully immunised children remained at around 60% in 2017-18, not much different from the National Family Health survey of 2015-16, which found it to be around 62%.

While this was a huge improvement from just 44% in 2005-06, the budget allocated for immunisation has also jumped from Rs 473 crore in 2005-06 to approximately Rs 2,000 crore allocated for the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) excluding shared costs such as staff salary, establishments etc.

India’s immunisation coverage has remained low relative to its neighbours. In Sri Lanka 99% of children are fully immunised. In Bangladesh, the coverage for DPT-3 was 98% and for measles was 93% in 2018, according to the World Health Report 2020. In Nepal, the coverage for the third shot of DPT was 91% and that for measles was 69%.

A child is considered to be fully immunised if she has received BCG, three doses of OPV, three shots of DPT vaccine and the measles vaccine. All these, if delivered on schedule, are within the child’s first year, with measles being the last. There are booster shots and vaccines for other diseases, but they do not count for considering a child fully immunised.

The central government’s Mission Indradhanush launched in December 2014 set the goal of ensuring full immunization for children up to two years of age and pregnant women. The govt identified 201 high focus districts across 28 states that had the highest number of partially immunized and unimmunized children. The government said the increase in full immunization coverage was just one percentage point per year earlier, but had increased to 6.7 percentage points per year through the first two phases of Mission Indradhanush.

A 2017 district-level study on routine immunization in Haryana led by Dr Shankar Prinja of the community medicine department in PGIMER, Chandigarh noted that the challenge of decreasing dropouts and enrolling the ones with no immunization at all had become ever more daunting as the country added a pool of 12.5 million partially immunized children each year. According to the NSO survey 3% of children received no immunisation at all. Considering that the survey was looking at children under six, even 3% would amount to millions of children. This proportion was as high as 7-8% in some states.

“Initially, Mission Indradhanush went off very well with an 18% increase in coverage in 190 districts. But states insisting on doing it in all districts instead of focusing on identified laggard districts has diluted its impact over time. As fatigue sets in, the mission becomes routine and that means children who were to be covered under routine immunisation get covered under the mission instead of the mission being to mop up children missed by routine immunisation,” explained Dr Anish Sinha of the Indian Institute of Public Health in Gandhinagar adding that this was happening because the routine immunisation system had not been adequately strengthened.

“The weakest link in the routine system are the health workers who are paid very poorly. A very motivated ASHA gets Rs 4,000 per month at best, including all incentives. It’s almost impossible to find anyone for that salary in urban areas where even a domestic help gets almost double that. Even in rural areas this is too little,” said Dr Sinha.

The mother and child tracking system and various other tech platforms and mobile-based applications launched to track data have been unsuccessful. Public health researchers point out that any technology is only as good as the people operating it and the data entered into it and thus it all boils down to the health workers expected to enter the data.

24,['30/08/2020'],"RIL Future Group Deal: Reliance puts Rs 25,000-crore bet on bright Future for retail","NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Ten days after it bought a majority stake in online pharmacy retailer Netmeds, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) on Saturday said it had sealed a deal to acquire the retail business of the financially-stressed Future Group for Rs 24,713 crore. The transaction, which has been in the works for months, will fortify RIL’s retail play in one of the world’s largest economies where it is already the largest player by reach, scale, revenue and profitability.

The contours of the deal include Future first combining its various entities across grocery retail, apparel retail, supply chain, logistics infrastructure and consumer products manufacturing with Future Enterprises, which is into manufacturing of fashion products.

It will then sell the retail and wholesale businesses covering the Big Bazaar hypermarket chain, Easyday grocery stores, Central malls and the Brand Factory fashion discount outlets to RIL. Future Enterprises will also transfer the logistics and warehousing businesses to RIL.

The businesses will be transferred on a slump sale basis. Slump sale means transfer of a division of a company for a lump sum without assigning any values to individual assets and liabilities of the entity. RIL has routed the proposed deal through its subsidiary Reliance Retail Ventures, which reported a consolidated turnover of Rs 1.6 lakh crore and profit of Rs 5,448 crore in fiscal 2020.

RIL will take over the debt and liabilities related to the retail and warehousing businesses and will invest Rs 1,600 crore for a minority stake of 13% in Future Enterprises as part of the deal. RIL, controlled by Mukesh Ambani, who is among the top five richest persons in the world, has been ramping up its retail play. In May, the company launched JioMart, an online grocery service, which competes with Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart .

“This acquisition is a watershed moment for India retail. It’s the equivalent of Walmart acquiring Target in the US,” said Levi Strauss MD (South Asia, Middle East and North Africa) Sanjeev Mohanty. “It augments the retail footprint and dominance of Reliance in the most important grocery business as they go to war against Amazon and Walmart.”

Future Group, owned by India’s father of modern retailing Kishore Biyani , was compelled to look for an acquirer after rising debt, falling valuation of its listed entities and declining earnings due to the pandemic started to weigh on it. Debt exceeded Rs 12,000 crore and almost the entire promoter holding was pledged with lenders.

“As a result of this reorganisation and transaction, the Future Group will achieve a holistic solution to the challenges that have been caused by Covid and the macro economic environment,” said Biyani.

Mohanty added that the RIL-Future deal “lays the foundation and pipeline for JioMart to build a true omni business at scale, reaching one billion consumers. Add to that the reach created by Jio Platforms and its partnership with Facebook and Google; it’s going to create a business model and ability to scale that would be a first in the world”.

Technopak founder Arvind Singhal said Reliance would be able to manage the malls business of Future Group much better as it has many top brands in its portfolio to place in the malls. “In Future Consumer, the company has built a strong range of private labels that can add to Reliance’s repertoire as well.”

Once the transfer of retail and warehousing businesses is completed, Future Enterprises will be left with the manufacturing of FMCG and fashion apparel products, insurance joint ventures with Generali and textile mills.

Chinese nationals have been accused in the scam for using Indians to carry out illegal online betting and collecting over Rs 1,300 crore. Large-scale transactions have also been found by some Chinese dating apps, illegally operating for Indian customers.

The Hyderabad police had earlier arrested three persons, including a Chinese national Yan Hao, who worked as manager of Beijing Tomorrow Power Company and a was a permanent resident of Beijing. The ED has started investigation into some Indian online wallets and payment gateways such as Paytm, Cashfree and Razorpay for their non-reporting of suspicious transactions. “There is a suspicion that, apart from indulging in banned activities like online betting, this network of companies with their reliance on online wallets and their lax regulatory systems could have been used for hawala transactions as well. The ED is in the process of obtaining information from online wallet companies, HSBC Bank, Registrar of Companies etc,” the agency said.

On Friday, the ED conducted searches across four cities and seized 17 hard disks, five laptops, phones, crucial incriminating documents and has also frozen Rs 47 crore held in four HSBC Bank accounts.

Dhiraj Sarkar and Ankit Kapoor are the Indian associates arrested in the Chinese online betting scam. “With the help of Indian chartered accountants, some Chinese nationals floated multiple Indian companies, initially kept dummy Indian directors to incorporate the companies and later replaced them with Chinese nationals who travelled to India for this purpose,” ED claimed.

Some locals were hired to open accounts with HSBC Bank and open trade accounts with online wallets Paytm, Cashfree, Razorpay etc. ED has initiated investigation under PMLA based on the FIRs lodged by the Cyber Crime Station of Hyderabad Police against Dokypay Technology Pvt Ltd , Linkyun Technolgy Pvt Ltd and others.

“Analysis of two bank accounts of Dokypay Technology revealed that, in the last year it had collected Rs 1,268 crore out of which Rs 300 crore came via Paytm payment gateway and around Rs 600 crore was transferred out via Paytm. Linkyun Technolgy made outward foreign remittances of Rs 120 crore.

The commission on Friday said that the flat buyer, R K Singhal, was not only entitled to the 11% interest as awarded by the state consumer commission in 2015 (Rs 39.4 lakh) but also the principal amount of Rs 8.2 lakh.“The appellant (Singhal) would be entitled to get Rs 47.6 lakh. The opposite party ( Sudradh Constructions Pvt Ltd ) is directed to pay this amount within a period of 45 days, failing which this amount will attract an interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of this order till actual payment,” the commission said.Singhal moved the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission against Sudradh Constructions Pvt Ltd in 2015 after he was aggrieved with the state commission’s order.While the state commission had granted him the compensation, it did not accept his plea to take possession of the flat which was constructed in 2014.The national commission agreed with the state commission’s ruling that the man was not entitled to the flat as he had made that demand several years after he had filed the complaint in 2001.In the 2001 complaint made before the state commission, Singhal had only sought a refund of the amount he had paid.He amended his complaint only at the final stage in June 2015, wanting to take possession of the flat.The national commission said that when Singhal’s amendment plea was allowed, the builder should have also been given a chance to file a revised written statement.“In the present case, nothing of this sort has been ordered by the state commission.

Members of a three-member committee of vice-chancellors (VCs), which had drafted the original statute, made necessary changes which were sent to the VCs of all the universities for their comments.

Some provisions of the statute had created resentment among the unemployed postgraduate degree holders of the state as they apprehended denial of jobs to them. Hence, the state government intervened in the matter and wrote to the chancellor for doing the needful to redress the genuine grievances of the local youths.

Now, candidates, who have obtained a PhD degree from the universities in Bihar during the period from July 11, 2009 till the date of implementation of the UGC Regulations, 2009, shall be exempted from the requirement of NET/SLET/SET for recruitment if they have been awarded the degree in compliance with the five conditions already prescribed by the UGC.

The revised statute further provides that the candidate should have published two research papers from his or her PhD work out of which one should be in a refereed journal. The provision of award of seven marks on MPhil degree has been deleted. The statute also states that the candidate will get two marks for each research paper published in peer-reviewed or UGC-listed journals. The option of publication in SCOPUS journals has been deleted.

Kumar, a 1987-batch IPS officer, retired from the police service on July 31 this year. He was last posted as the director general-cum-managing director, Bihar Police Building Construction Corporation. Kumar had served as senior SP of Patna district for more than six years from 1997.

Hailing from a family of politicians and bureaucrats, Kumar took the membership of JD(U) from the party’s leader in the Lok Sabha and Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh.

Kumar’s father Chandrika Ram was a veteran Congress leader and also served as minister in the K B Sahay government while his elder brother Anil Kumar is Congress’s sitting MLA from Bhore seat in Gopalganj district. Sunil’s other elder brother, Ajit Kumar, was an Indian Foreign Service officer.

Insiders in the JD(U) said the former DGP might contest assembly election from his family’s traditional seat Bhore, if his brother and sitting Congress MLA Anil agrees to quit from the contest. Other sources said Sunil would be sent to the legislative council from the Governor’s quota.

JD(U) leader Lalan Singh, however, declined to make any clear cut comment on the former DGP’s likely role in the party. “Who will contest election and who will not will be decided by the party’s top leaders at an appropriate time,” Lalan told media persons.

After joining the JD(U), Sunil told reporters that he had full faith in the policies of CM Nitish Kumar. “I am joining politics as well as the JD(U) with the sole intention of doing social service. I will do whatever task the party leaders assign to me,” Sunil said.

You have noted in the book that the relationship between trainer and client is one that trades “bodily capital” with the promise of upward social mobility. Could you explain?

Fitness trainers and clients do get close, even romantic, across the world. Did the trainers you interviewed talk about things getting personal or are class differences keeping people apart?

Did you study any other professions that offer a similar mobility?

With gyms shutting down due to

lockdowns and the need for distancing even when they eventually open, do you think it will be a body blow for the industry or can it bounce back?

I first became interested in India when the country celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1997. That year, international magazines were paying considerable attention to the transformation the country had undergone since the economic liberalisation of 1991. As a student of anthropology , I started wondering how Indians themselves experienced this change. Besides the rapid growth of shopping malls and new places of leisure everywhere, I couldn’t help notice the mushrooming of gyms everywhere. At first I had simply interpreted this as a sign that people were concerned about their health, but there seemed to be much more going on. While I visited gyms and attended bodybuilding and male modelling competitions across India, I particularly spent a lot of time in one small neighbourhood gym in South Delhi. This really helped develop a better understanding of the daily interactions between clients and trainers.It really took three Bollywood movies to move away from the old potbelly ideal and popularise a lean, muscular variety instead. Pyaar Kiya to Darna Kya (1998) with Salman Khan was the first time men realised what could be achieved with their bodies. The actual fitness boom in India commenced in full only when Shah Rukh Khan revealed his freshly-baked six-pack in Om Shanti Om (2007). After that it became crucial for movies to highlight the transformation a star had undergone in terms of his body. Aamir Khan remains the uncrowned king of bodily transformation, something that started with Ghajini (2008) and reached new heights with Dangal (2016).Trainers are generally from lower (‘new’) middle-class and vernacular backgrounds while their clients belong to the English-speaking upper (‘older’) middle-class. While we often think that the most important factor of difference is money, I found that social capital matters equally, if not more. This includes things like knowing how to behave in a particular setting, one’s fluency in English, what clothes to wear etc. For a person who is a new entrant to the middle class, this can be quite bewildering. During training sessions there is often time for banter which allows trainers to learn from their clients in terms of their lifestyles, to improve their English, and even pick up on business skills.It was often a source of gossip in gyms, especially when personal trainers also offered training at home. One thing that stood out was how it often led to confusion in terms of intentions. Upper middle-class female clients rarely appeared to think of it more than a one-night stand but trainers sometimes let their romantic feelings get the better of them which quickly revealed the social distance that continues to exist. Usually this would mean their contract with a particular gym was terminated. Photo shoots, modelling assignments and casting calls, on the other hand, often confront trainers with situations where they are asked for sexual favours by other men. Some men now supplement their income by offering semi-nude or pornographic content online, or by engaging in sex work. But for the majority, this is not something they are willing to consider.I have earlier published on the topic of Starbucks baristas. This is another example where employees are encouraged to bond with their regular customers, which offers the opportunity to learn from them. However, such encounters are more fleeting and less personal.While the boom in fitness is ongoing, the proliferation of gyms across India felt excessive in recent years. Under the pandemic, home-gymming has seen a huge surge with trainers making house calls. Another important development is outdoor ‘functional’ training which takes place in parks and nature. Most trainers are typically self-made men and they are by nature survivors but there has been a huge loss of income due to the pandemic.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77825944,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-520410,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/gym-trainers-who-fall-for-clients-only-end-up-losing-jobs-social-distance-still-exists-says-anthropologist-michiel-baas/articleshow/77825579.cms

The government had recently convened a webinar-cum- panel discussion with leading toys manufacturers on ‘Establishing India as a Global Toy Manufacturing Hub–Global prospects and Karnataka opportunities.’

Industries minister Jagadish Shettar said that toy manufacturing will get a renewed push after Prime Minister’s Narendra Modi’s clarion call that Indian toy market has enormous potential and can bring a transformative change in the industry by promoting ‘Vocal for Local’ under Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign.

The first unit may start production may begin in the next 10 months. ""We hope to attract around Rs 5,000 crore investment at the toy cluster and expect over 40,000 direct and indirect jobs to be be created in Koppal district alone in the next 5 years"" he added.

Gaurav Gupta, principal secretary to the government, commerce and industries department, said that the government has identified Koppal as the first toy manufacturing cluster in India.

H M Revannagowda, managing director, Udyog Mitra, said that the Koppal toy cluster will be a one-stop-destination facilitating globally competitive and reliable manufacturing solutions with co-located facilities. ""It’s an internationally competitive self-sustained ecosystem catering to all infrastructure requirements of the toy industry. With access to highway ports, airports and major cities, the cluster will provide an efficient network of connectivity. Koppal yoy cluster is on National Highway 63 and well connected to other modes of transportation. It is located close to Hubballi, a major trading hub in nothern part of the state"" he claimed.

BOX

Koppal is first of its kind toy manufacturing cluster in India, and the state is making sure that all toys manufacturing requirements are available in this cluster.

Karnataka is the third-largest market for toys in India ($ 159 million) – 9.1% of the national market.

Karnataka toy industry has grown at a CAGR of 18% (2010-17), expected to reach USD 310 million by 2023.

Labour-intensive manufacturing is being seen as a focus that would help the toys industry.

Over 45,000 students will take the exams. The university also decided that students who are unable to appear in September, can apply for exemption and take supplementary exams scheduled som days after the regular exam.

The decision was taken in a meeting of the academic council held on Saturday.

“Many students come from distant locations to exam centres. A day’s gap will help them relax and prepare well for the next paper,” said Hemali Desai, in-charge vice chancellor of VNSGU. Since hostels are closed, students will have to come to exam centres from their natives in different parts of south Gujarat.

Second and fourth semester exam of PG courses will start September 2 while sixth semester exam from second week. “Earlier, the UG exam was scheduled on September 9, but after one-day gap in all exams now, it can start only after PG exams are over,” said an official.

“Those who want exemption need fill up the form available on the university website,” said Desai.

The council also approved the proposal to enable students, who have completed ITI and hold a government equivalent certificate, admission in BA. There was no such provision till now . Commerce and science streams already have their rules for admitting ITI students.

43,['30/08/2020'],"In AP, opposition parties tread with caution on capital issue","Women protest against the three capital cities proposal in Amaravati

VIJAYAWADa: With the high court issuing notices to political parties in the state to file affidavits ‘if they wish’ on the capital issue , all parties now have to come out with a clear stance on the issue that has been on the boil for the last one year.

Though all parties, barring the ruling YSRC, have opposed the government’s proposal to trifurcate the capital, filing an affidavit in the high court may not be easy as it would be on record and cannot be changed later like any other political rhetoric.

The biggest challenge for the parties is to balance regional aspirations. As the stance that they take now on the capital issue is likely to have long-standing ramifications in future, parties are brainstorming to come up with a stand which will not hurt their political future in the state.

Though the high court has not made it mandatory to file the affidavit, making it clear that they can do so only if they wish to file one, fence-sitting is also not an option, says K Indraneel Babu, who is the advocate for the farmers.

“It was a statutory promise that the state made to farmers of Amaravati to give developed plots in the capital city which would be developed as per the notified master plan. Scaling down the master plan is curtailing compensation, which is nothing but cheating by the state. It is the moral responsibility of all political parties to come up with a clear stand on the issue though it is not a legal obligation. They have to tell the people of the state on which side they are now,” he said.

Jana Sena is the first party to announce it will file an affidavit in the high court. But there have been no such signals from the TDP, BJP, Congress and Left parties as of now. As the issue has already become an emotional and sentimental one with rising aspirations from all three regions in the state, opposition parties seem to be treading cautiously on the issue.

The central investigating agency has sought a fresh non-bailable warrant from the designated court against the accused, who, the agency claims, are absconding.

On Friday, a team of ED officials conducted searches on the premises of “associate companies” of Shree Ganesh Jewellery House. The agency has reasons to believe that the company was using these associate companies to continue with transactions. During the raid, which continued till the early hours of Saturday, the officers seized several documents pertaining to transactions with Shree Ganesh Jewellery House, details of investments, cash deposits and bank account details.

Earlier, in July, the agency had slapped a show-cause notice on the company for siphoning off Rs 7,220 crore — the highest ever under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) — in alleged illegal foreign exchange deals. The agency officials now feel Nilesh and his associates are absconding and hiding in Dubai. ED officials also believe the company is trying to evade the FEMA notice by taking the route of insolvency before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.

Meanwhile, Nilesh received a no-coercion order from the Supreme Court after a petition was moved there. “We have challenged some provisions of the PMLA Act in connection with the case and also challenged a Calcutta High Court order. There was a non-bailable warrant issued by the lower court, which was not cancelled by the High Court. The Supreme Court directed no-coercive action against him,” said Ashish Batra, the lawyer representing Nilesh in Supreme Court . The same order was passed in an SLP filed by Nilesh’s wife and son.

KOLKATA: With the CLAT examination being rescheduled from September 7 to September 28, thousands of examinees from Bengal are hoping the date of the NEET UG examination might also be deferred. Some students have written to Supreme Court Chief Justice S A Bobde to postpone JEE and NEET till the situation improved.

Bengal higher education minister Partha Chatterjee questioned Union human resources minister R P Nishank on why the future of so many students was being jeopardized when the transport system was still not fully operational.

Santanu Pal, who scored 92% in HS this year and wants to appear for both JEE and NEET, said his JEE centre is at TCS Gitabitan in New Town and his NEET centre is at Kendriya Vidyalaya in Sector V. “It is very difficult for me to travel from Ghola in North 24 Parganas to reach Sector V. I need to change buses a number of times and there are anyway very few buses from Ghola. I am still not certain if I will be able to appear for JEE (Mains) due to the transport problem,” he said.

Amiya Kumar Maity, who mentors NEET UG students, said he had appealed to the PM to postpone NEET UG till normalcy was back as he said the centre in charge could bar a student from entering if the examinee was in quarantine or a Covid patient. Also, it would be difficult for examinees to reach the venues, he added.

Debajyoti Kar, who also mentors Neet UG students, felt if the exam was not postponed, the state should withdraw the lockdown on September 12 to facilitate movement of examinees.

Pramod Varma, a resident of Pandesara, was caught on Wednesday and handed over to Umra police station for investigation. He was taken to NCH for the mandatory pre-arrest Covid-19 test. As he complained of fever, Varma was admitted pending his Covid report.

However, he disappeared from the hospital ward at around 6.30am on Friday on the ruse of going to the washroom. Varma was in the custody of a lok rakshak police constable. Since he was not a prisoner, security was not tight in that ward.

Investigation revealed that before escaping, Varma had made a call from the phone of another patient. Police suspect he called someone to pick him up. He was spotted going on the road on the back side of the NCH in CCTV footage.

Deputy commissioner of police Vidhi Chaudhary ordered an inquiry by assistant commissioner of police (ACP), E-division, NS Desai to ascertain if there was any negligence on part of the cops.

So far 16 persons have been arrested in the case. Varma operates a few spas where he runs prostitution rackets at these massage parlours. The racket was exposed earlier this month when the girl escaped from one of the massage parlours where she was forced into flesh trade by a woman named Muskan Mohammed Dadhi Shaikh.

BHARUCH/SURAT: About 21 villages located close to the embankment of Narmada river in Jhagadia, Bharuch and Ankleshwar talukas in Bharuch district have been put on alert following heavy discharge of water from the Sardar Sarovar dam . Four lakh cusecs have been already released following very heavy rains in the river’s catchment areas on Saturday.

A team of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) too has been put on stand-by in the district for rescue and relief work following the flood alert issued by the Bharuch district administration on Saturday.

Sardar Sarovar dam authorities said continuous rainfall in the upstream catchment area in Narmada river on Saturday caused the dam to fill with fresh water. The water level at Sardar Sarovar Dam continued to rise since Wednesday and reached 131.13 metres on Saturday evening. The present level of 138.68 metres is only 7.53 metres short from the top level. Till Saturday afternoon, the dam authorities were releasing 4 lakh cusecs of water, which was increased to 5 lakh cusecs by 5pm. In the phase manner, the release of water will be increased up to 8 lakh cusecs till late Saturday night.

District collector of Bharuch, Dr MD Modiya said, “Due to heavy rains in the catchment of Sardar Sarovar dam, the discharge of water has been increased up to 5 lakh cusecs to 8 lakh cusecs. People in low-lying areas in Jhagadia, Bharuch and Ankleshwar have been advised not to venture near the river and stay alert. The administration is fully prepared to meet any eventuality.”

Sources said that the water level at Narmada river in Bharuch touched 17 feet and is likely to cross 30 feet mark by early morning on Sunday with the release of 8 lakh cusecs of water.

49,['30/08/2020'],"Indexing of Covid patients yields results, Bengal govt keeps fingers crossed","KOLKATA: Round-the-clock assessment of Covid patients ’ key health parameters and live updates on their condition online — prompting immediate measures — have resulted in a spurt in the recovery rate of critical patients in the city as well as the state, believe doctors and hospital administrators. The Critical Covid Patient Management System (CCPMS) launched by the state government, which is designed to prioritize treatment on the basis of the degree of seriousness of patients, has made a difference, they felt.Under the system, each Covid patient across private and government hospitals now has a unique index number. “We have divided all symptomatic patients (including those in private health facilities) into yellow, orange and red categories. On the basis of their key health parameters, doctors give them an index number between 1 to 20. The less the number, the less the risk. High-risk patients are numbers 12 and upwards,” said a senior health department officer.Each of the Covid doctors has been given a tab. According to the CCPMS protocol, a doctor must give an online update once for low-risk (yellow) patients, twice for medium-risk (orange) and three to four times for high-risk patients (red) through some simple steps on the tab. The updates include all the key health parameters — oxygen saturation level, pulse rate, blood sugar level, urine output, functioning of different vital organs and support system availed by a patient.“The system is immensely useful and I have the information of all my Covid patients on one tap on the tab. No patient goes unchecked. This has also helped us in rationalizing bed allocation. Only the most critical patients are getting ICU (intensive care unit), CCU (critical care unit) or HDU (high dependency unit) beds. The system is also releasing patients from the hospital when their index count goes below 2,” said Sishir Naskar, superintendent of M R Bangur Hospital, Bengal’s first Covid-designated hospital.The system has also helped patients’ kin keep track of their loved ones’ condition. Seventy-seven-year-old Arnab Malakar (name changed), who was very critical and on ventilation support, was gradually downgraded from red to orange and then to yellow much to the joy of his son Pranab. “I kept tabs on daily online updates of his health parameters. I almost lost hope at one point of time because of his age and comorbidities,” said Pranab.The periodic monitoring has also helped in identifying patients in ‘cytokine storm’ (a rapid deterioration leading to widespread tissue damage and multi-organ failure). Apparently, there might be no apparent symptoms but a closer scrutiny can help arrest a rapid deterioration of an otherwise healthy patient.

District administration will provide all support as required.”He further said that transportation would not be a problem for the aspirants and their guardians as buses and auto-rickshaws are already plying.The administration has instructed that the examination hall, staircases and railings should be sanitized after each shift and a new mask provided to each candidate.In Bihar , this examination will be held in 43 centres across seven districts. Patna has a maximum of 20 centres with the majority in Pataliputra locality. However, several centres are in the outskirts of the capital in areas such as Zero Mile and Chedi Tola in Phulwarisharif. Muzaffarpur DM Chandrashekhar Singh said examination will be held across six centres in the district. “The agency involved in conducting this examination will ensure that the centre’s floors, walls, doors and gates are disinfected and sanitizer bottles are arranged at the entrance,” Singh said, adding, “Candidates and their guardians will not face any problem in reaching the centre as all modes of transportation like buses, auto-rickshaws and taxis are now running.”As per the advisory issued by the Centre, candidates will be allowed to enter the hall with exam-related documents, a simple transparent ballpoint pen, a personal hand sanitizer (50ml) and a transparent water bottle. Candidates will be provided three-ply masks at the entrance.However, many students and opposition parties have protested and demanded that this examination be postponed. Parents are worried that, if held, they will have no choice but to accompany their wards to the exam centre.“Since Covid-19 pandemic has become a new normal, everything has to continue. But in Bihar, floods are the main problem. We stay in the capital and can reach the centres easily, but what about students stuck in flood-affected areas. For them, it will be difficult to reach the centre and I think all students should be given a fair chance,” said Sanya Tiwari, whose younger brother Harsh will be taking this examination.Another Sabzibagh resident Shakeela Bano, whose son Akbar Imam, will be appearing said, “I have instructed my son not to remove his mask and maintain social distance. His centre is near Pahari which is quite far away. There is no bus route or direct auto from our locality to the centre. We will have to book a cab and pay extra.”",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77831589,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-72464,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jee-neet-exam-halls-to-have-covid-safety-say-officials/articleshow/77826645.cms
51,['30/08/2020'],SC sets aside bail granted by HC to Uday cinema hall owner’s killer,"Supreme Court

PATNA: The Supreme Court has rescinded the bail granted to alleged sharpshooter Amit Kumar alias Amit Singh in connection with the killing of Bihta traders’ association founder member Nirbhay Kumar Singh.

Singh was shot at the entrance of his cinema hall Uday Chitra Mandir at Bihta in western Patna on September 15, 2017. Amit was one of the shooters who had opened fire on Singh, as per police.

The bench of Justice L Nageshwara Rao , Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice S Ravindra Bhat while setting aside the Patna high court’s bail order, observed that it should not have released Amit on bail.

The bench was hearing an appeal filed by Singh’s brother Ajay Kumar against the high court order.

Counsels Smarhar Singh and Ashutosh Thakur , representing Kumar and the state government’s counsel Manish Kumar apprised the bench that Amit was involved in many criminal cases and was a habitual offender.

The bench observed that the HC without considering submissions made regarding criminal antecedents of Amit granted him bail because he had been in custody since March 28, 2018, and taking into account present Covid-19 condition.

Amit was granted bail by HC on June 10 this year. HC had considered factors such as period undergone in custody along with several other materials, which had come up during investigation besides no chance of conclusion of the trial soon due to the lockdown while granting him bail.

Petitioner Ajay had also appealed against the bail granted to co-accused Mohammad Shabir and Shankar Chaudhary on May 1, 2019. State government counsel Manish Kumar had submitted that bail granted to Shabir was cancelled and a non-bailable warrant was issued against him while service is incomplete in Shankar’s case. SC ordered for completing service within four weeks by trial court and list matter afterwards for hearing.

Singh’s brother Ajay while talking to TOI over the phone on Saturday said the matter was heard on August 26 but the order sheet came in the public domain only on Friday evening.

Ajay, who is also association’s executive member, said at least government should follow up important cases across the state to take it to their logical conclusion so that society is not disheartened and faith remains on the law.

“It gives a feeling of being an orphan if victim’s family like me fights alone up to Supreme court against criminal gangs,” he said.

“Conviction of accused would ensure no tolerance against crime. Police reaching spot after a crime and conducting raids while criminal getting bail afterwards won’t act as a deterrent to crime,” he added.

52,['30/08/2020'],‘Patna University grew when VCs from Bihar were at its helm’,"PATNA: Academics of the state continue voicing their concern over the appointment of “outsiders” as vice-chancellors (VCs) of different universities. Citing the example of the 103-year-old Patna University (PU), they claim its academic and infrastructural development took place only when people from within the state occupied the highest office.

According to old-timers, out of the 52 people, who have been appointed as the VCs of PU so far, three — J G Jennings, V H Jackson and Stewart Macpherson — were Britishers. However, many positive developments — construction of magnificent university buildings, introduction of new courses, establishment of full-fledged postgraduate departments and promotion of research activities — took place when “insiders” were at the helm of PU.

Former head of PU psychology department, Shamshad Hussain , says, “The buildings occupying the PU office as well as the Wheeler Senate House were constructed when Sir Sultan Ahmad was the VC from 1923 to 1930. Later, most of the PG departments — political science, psychology, geography, applied economics and commerce, sociology, labour and social welfare, physics, geology, botany, zoology, statistics and ancient Indian history and archaeology — were established in the university when Sir Sachchidanand Sinha , Sir C P N Singh and Sarangdhar Singh served as its VCs.”

Hussain adds, “It was Balbhadra Prasad who created an atmosphere of research in the university during his regime from 1957 to 1960. George Jacob also did a commendable job when he was the VC of PU (1962-1965) by improving the overall academic atmosphere and creating a sense of discipline on the campus. Later, he became the chairman of the University Grants Commission.”

State’s former higher education director, Nageshwar Prasad Sharma, also recalls that the contributions of most “outsiders” in PU’s development are almost insignificant. “Only K N Bahl (1952-1953) and Y C Simhadri (2006-2008) made some positive contributions during their regime. Two others, Sachin Dutt (1972-1973) and K K Jha (2001-2004), streamlined the financial system of the university. If the teachers and non-teaching staff of PU are still getting their salaries regularly, it is only because of these VCs,” he says.

Appreciating the performance of local academics serving as VCs, former head of PU English department, Shiva Jatan Thakur, points out, “Outsiders fail to perform because they are unfamiliar with the university laws, statutes and circulars issued by the chancellor and the state government from time to time.”

He also regrets that the academic milieu of PU deteriorated during the regime of such VCs “who preferred to administer the university at their whims instead of rules and regulations, giving rise to a series of litigations”.

How can people have faith in the CM who lies even in the House? He should make it clear when the committee will be formed,” Tejashwi said while addressing a press conference at the RJD office here.He said nearly 80,000 Covid-19 cases were registered in the state in August alone. “The CM had said that the number of tests through RT-PCR method will be increased. However, most samples are still being tested through rapid antigen kit, which does not give accurate results,” Tejashwi said.He also criticised the government for “poor handling” of floods in the state. “Nearly 84 lakh people were affected by floods, but the government did nothing concrete for them. “Nitish should tell people what the government has done with the money donated to the CM’s relief fund. It is surprising that none from the Centre has so far visited the state to take stock of flood situation. The CM visited the flood-affected areas only after we exerted pressure on him,” Tejashwi said.Tejashwi said if people give Mahagathbandhan an opportunity to form government, it would work for economic justice the way Lalu Prasad had worked for social justice to all.Tejashwi, however, remained tight-lipped on the issue of senior RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and an announcement made by former parliamentarian Rama Singh that he would join the RJD.Reacting to Tejashwi’s charges, JD(U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad said Nitish had been serving people with dedication for the last 15 years and worked for both social and economic justice. “Who is honest and who is a liar will be decided by the people and not Tejashwi. If he has forgotten then let me remind him that his father used to make fun of flood victims by saying that they should welcome Goddess Ganga at their doorstep and enjoy free fish from the floodwaters. As far as migrant workers are concerned, many of them were provided job after their skill mapping,” Nishad added.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77831775,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-487903,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-lashes-out-at-cm-over-covid-floods/articleshow/77826717.cms

PATNA: The Vaishali police are in a fix after a video of a ‘ murdered girl ’ surfaced in which she is claiming to be alive. She said she had fled home to marry a man of her choice.

The girl’s father Chulhai Rai (55) had lodged an FIR with the Rajapakar police station on August 21 that his daughter, aged around 17 years, was kidnapped by Sanoj Kumar Rai (24) and four others.

SHO Naushad Alam said within six hours of lodging the FIR, Chulhai and his family members informed the police that their daughter’s body has been found dumped at a roadside in a village under Bidupur police station.

“On August 22 morning the body was recovered. Chulhai Rai and other family members identified it as their daughter’s body. Thereafter body was handed over to them after conducting a post mortem,” the SHO said, adding, the body was later cremated.

“However, on Friday night, we came to know that the girl assumed to be murdered has released a video that she was alive and had married Sanoj. We are now trying to make the girl appear before police,” he said.

The SHO said it has also come to light that she had informed her family members after the body was recovered that she was alive.

“Chulhai had submitted a written complaint against Sanoj and four others of his family for killing his daughter after body recovery,” he said, adding, raids were being conducted to nab Sanoj and others for killing the girl.

Alam said the girl is aged around 22 years and had fled almost three days before her father informed the police. “She had also taken away jewellery, educational certificates and clothes,” Alam said.

“Police didn’t preserve DNA samples from the body for all these reasons. Chulhai Rai didn’t even provide his daughter’s photograph to police for matching,” he said adding police believes he and his family members knowingly misguided the police.

Vaishali SP Maneesh said the father and other family members would be now quizzed as to why they claimed that the body was of their daughter.

“The ambit of the investigation has now increased with the girl’s video surfacing claiming she is alive,” he said.

The SP said police will now also ascertain the identity of the body which had been cremated by Chulhai Rai and his family claiming it to be of their daughter.

PATNA: The BJP top leadership on Saturday asked its all MPs from Bihar to visit 60 panchayats each in their respective Lok Sabha constituencies in next one month to establish direct contact with workers of the party and electors in a bid to apprise people of development works undertaken by the state and the central governments.

The exercise will begin in the first week of September and conclude on October 2, the birth anniversary of father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi.

The MPs, including those from the Rajya Sabha and other senior party functionaries, will work together at booth level in all the 243 assembly constituencies to ensure the victory of not only the BJP candidates in the upcoming assembly polls, but also of the other two NDA partners — JD(U) and LJP.

A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of all the party MPs from Bihar in New Delhi chaired by national president J P Nadda . Party incharge for Bihar Bhupendra Yadav, party’s election incharge for Bihar Devendra Fadnavis and five ministers from the state were also present at the meeting.

Describing the monthlong exercise as ‘going from virtual to physical’, newly-elected Rajya Sabha member Vivek Thakur said everybody has been given specific tasks to accomplish within the timeframe. “Though the MPs have to attend the Parliament session during the period, they will visit the respective panchayats under their Lok Sabha constituencies on weekends,” he added.

Later talking to media persons, state BJP president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said each MP has been asked to chalk out strategy to ensure the victory of NDA candidates. “The MPs will meet the office-bearers of each ‘mandal’ and chalk out poll strategies. The idea is to win more and more seats in the assembly polls,” he added.

It was also decided to observe PM Narendra Modi’s birth anniversary on September 17 as ‘Seva Diwas’ and Pandit Din Dayal Upadhyay’s death anniversary on September 25 as ‘Samarpan Diwas’. Every party worker and functionary from the state will connect with ‘PM’s Mann Ki Baat’ programme and observe Gandhi’s jayanti with special emphasis on October 2.

Jaiswal said, “The NDA will go to polls with a development agenda. We will show our commitment for development of all sections of the society.”

Mukhtar gang had seen ominous signs in January when Mau police opened the file of issuance of licenses to four individuals on fake documents on the recommendation by the MLA on his official letterhead. The damage started after May 31 when Mau police stopped extortion in the name of taxi stands by his henchmen and booked them.

The gang’s monopoly in meat and fish trade in Mau, Jaunpur , Varanasi was broken and then land captured by them at the site of Andhau air strip in Ghazipur, in rural belts of Mau and Ghazipur was reclaimed. ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan told TOI on Saturday, “The action against illegal possession of government and private land, demolition of illegal construction like slaughterhouse on Friday has caused a loss of Rs 70 crore to them. The total loss to Mukhtar’s gang due to ongoing action is over Rs 111 crore, as illegal earning of Rs 41 crore per annum has been stopped in this zone.” “Mukhtar has many henchmen who kept running the gang’s illegal activities even though he is behind the bars. We took action against such individuals and have arrested 100 so far and 78 of them were booked under Gangster Act while 12 have been externed. Seven persons who grabbed PWD and coal contracts with Mukhtar’s backing are on police radar, investigation is on and action will follow soon,” the ADG said. Police also targeted Mukhtar gang’s armoury by starting verification of arms licences and found large scale irregularities in documents. “25 arms licenses of Mukhtar’s close aides in Mau and Ghazipur have been suspended or cancelled and the arms surrendered,” he added.

It was opened only before the Pujas after undergoing urgent, but temporary, repairs. Bridge experts had said its steel superstructure cannot withstand too much weight any more as it was heavily corroded and added that a new bridge needed to be set up after dismantling the existing structure.

The authorities had conducted a survey to plan an alternative traffic route while the new bridge was being built. “The soil testing has been completed. Now, a detailed project report will be prepared,” said a KMDA official . According to plans, the new bridge will come up across Circular Canal, connecting Canal West Road and Kolkata Station Road and will help decongest RG Kar bridge.

KMDA authorities are also waiting for the final decision to be taken by the committee headed by the chief secretary following recommendations by an expert committee that has been appointed to figure out whether Posta flyover will be fully or partially dismantled.

KOLKATA: Eastern Railway has cleared the design of the bearings for Majerhat ROB , but the state PWD cannot install them unless the former inspects and gives its written permission.

The state public works department (PWD), implementing agency of the Majerhat ROB reconstruction project , has been waiting for the zonal railway’s permission to install the 12 bearings in the 76m girder that was launched over the railway tracks on July 10. When it started the girder launching on June 2, PWD had hoped to commission the new bridge by this October.

Last Sunday, TOI reported that construction of Majerhat rail overbridge, which falls under ER’s ambit, has stopped because of the pending clearance.

ER engineers told their PWD counterparts on Friday that the latter must seek an inspection of the bearings. ER can issue its permission only after this inspection. ER’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Nikhil K Chakraborty said on Friday, “ER approved the bearings’ design on Wednesday. Now, PWD must formally approach us and offer the bearings for inspection.”

“The letter has been sent. ER will come for the inspection next week,” said state PWD minister Aroop Biswas on Saturday.

But state officials said every passing day has become crucial since they are trying to throw open the bridge by end-October.

“More than two weeks have been wasted. We don’t know if we can meet the pre-Puja deadline. After the bearings are installed, the deck slab will be cast. This involves a complex job of enforcement binding of steel to create the deck’s base on which concrete will be cast,” said an official.

63,['30/08/2020'],Belagavi’s hopes for int’l airport yet to materialise,"Belagavi: Even a year after putting forth a request to launch international air operations from Belagavi airport at Sambra , it is yet to be fulfilled.

In 2019, MP and minister of state for railways Suresh Angadi had met the managing director of Air India to press for flights to Dubai . The requested route for the operations is Goa-Belagavi-Dubai. The flights can be operated twice or thrice a week, depending upon demand. The people from the Mumbai-Karnataka region either travel to Goa or Bengaluru to fly to Dubai. Belagavi airport is the second busiest in Karnataka, according to the last three months data.

Setting up a cargo area to facilitate exports and imports and expanding infrastructure to match international norms could be more or less sufficient to launch the services. Krishna Giriyannavar, an active citizen from Belagavi, said flights to Dubai are the need of the hour, as a good number of people travel there for work and tourism. The elected representatives have to work to bring Belagavi under the UDAN scheme, he said. He added that an Indian Institute of Technology did not materialise in Belagavi due to lack of political will, and that politicians should show commitment to realise this.

Suresh Angadi said that there was no follow up done after 2019 on international flights from Belagavi, and that a feasibility study has to be conducted before coming up with the service. Air India looks into commercial, tourism and trade feasibility before venturing into a new service. “We need demand from people, and flights can operate on the Belagavi-Goa-Dubai or Goa-Belagavi-Dubai routes. The density of people travelling to Goa from Kerala before moving to Dubai or vice-versa, traffic from the Mumbai-Karnataka region and prospects of import and exports is what matters,” he said.

Belagavi Airport director Rajesh Kumar Maurya said the present length of runway is 2,300m, on which Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft can operate. However, there are technical calculations to see weather at certain load and certain temperature, if flights can take off. “To start international flights, the ministry of civil aviation has to send a proposal to the Airports Authority of India (AAI), after which the AAI conducts a feasibility study. So far there is no such proposal,” he said. He informed that to build inbound and outbound cargo storage facilities, a site has been identified between the Indian Air Force wall and air traffic control tower, after the first proposed site was rejected due to security reasons. He further said the airport may require more infrastructure to upgrade it to an international one.

64,['30/08/2020'],Karnataka on alert against doorstep delivery of dangerous fake seeds,"Hubballi: With packets containing fake seeds turning up in various countries and the Union ministry putting states on alert, Karnataka agriculture minister BC Patil has asked farmers to remain vigilant and report any such unsolicited delivery to the neighbourhood Raitha Samparka Kendra.

Alerting districts to the seed packet scam that has been reported in the US, New Zealand and Australia among other countries, the agriculture department has asked authorities to warn farmers against sowing these, as they may contain plant pathogens or chemicals harmful to humans. The US agriculture department said it has traced the seeds to China and these could be part of an online scam. The department identified at least 14 species, including mustard, cabbage, herbs, hibiscus and roses.

Rajashekhar Bijapur and Rudreshappa, joint directors of agriculture for Dharwad and Gadag respectively, told TOI that they had received a letter from the Union ministry of agriculture & farmers’ welfare on August 6, asking authorities to keep an eye on delivery of packets containing fake seeds. “These unsolicited seed parcels may contain seeds of an alien invasive species or pathogens of disease that pose a serious threat to the environment, agricultural ecosystem and national security,” the letter from deputy commissioner in the Union ministry Dilip Kumar Srivastava said. “Unsolicited parcels can be a threat to biodiversity of our country.”

Joint director of agriculture in Haveri Manjunath B said both the postal department and courier companies have been asked to stay vigilant so as to prevent delivery of these packages to unsuspecting farmers. “However, we have not had complaints of such packages being delivered thus far in Dharwad, Gadag and Haveri districts,” he said.

A meeting of farmers has been called in Dharwad and Gadag make them aware of the threat and ensure they do not fall prey to it

PATNA: Four minor girls drowned while plucking flowers from a water body and one somehow managed to survive at Laxmipur Lalchand village under the Bihariganj police station area in Madhepura district around 6am on Saturday.

SHO of Bihariganj police station Akhilesh Kumar said the four victims – Libha Kumari (14), Preeti Kumari (10), Mausam Kumari (12) and Kalyani Kumari (12) – were from different families.

The SHO said while Libha was a resident of Laxmipur Lalchand village, the other three victims hailed from the neighbouring Biwi Ranpal village.

“The girls went deep into the water body looking for flowers and got drowned,” the SHO said, adding the fifth girl was rushed to a local hospital in semi-conscious condition as she had also gulped water.

“The bodies of the girls were sent to sadar hospital for post-mortem. A case of unnatural death was registered on the basis of a written complaint submitted by Libha’s father Niranjan Mistry,” he added.

Bihariganj circle officer Nagesh Kumar Mehta said the process to provide Rs 4 lakh ex gratia to the kin of each of the deceased had been initiated. “Aggrieved families have been asked to provide their identity cards and bank details so that the ex gratia amount could be provided to them,” the CO said, adding Libha’s kin will get ex gratia from Bihariganj circle office and the rest three families from Udakishunganj circle office.

70,['30/08/2020'],Bihar: Return of migrants to workplaces set to become poll issue for opposition,"Migrant workers have complained of lack of job opportunities in state

PATNA: Migration of workers, especially from the north Bihar region, is all set to become a poll issue for the opposition in the state if the statement of the leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav is any indication.

Tejashwi on Saturday slammed CM Nitish Kumar for his alleged failure to create more jobs for migrant workers who returned during the Covid-19 lockdown. “Workers who walked thousands of km to reach their homes during nation-wide lockdown are again heading back to megacities outside the state for jobs,” Tejashwi said.

His remarks came a day after former Madhepura MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav criticized the state government on the same issue. Earlier, former union minister and United Democratic Alliance (UDA) chief Yashwant Sinha had raised the issue of exodus of migrant workers from the state due to lack of job opportunities.

Several air-conditioned buses from states such as Tamil Nadu , Punjab, New Delhi, Gujarat, Kerala and Maharashtra can be seen in several remote villages of Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Sitamarhi, Madhubani, Purnia, Katihar, Madhepura, Kishanganj and Supaul districts. They have been sent by owners of private firms to ferry workers, who had earlier returned during the lockdown.

A 28-year-old migrant worker, Roop Chandra Ram, a resident of Mohiuddin Nagar in Samastipur district, said he would leave for Ahmedabad on September 1 where he earlier worked in the cotton industry. He will be accompanied by 12 others from his village. Train tickets have been booked by the employer.

Recently Pappan Singh, a mushroom grower from New Delhi, sent air tickets for 20 migrant workers from Bihar who had been working for him for the past 15-20 years but were forced to return home in May. Some of them flew for the first time and had cars waiting to the Delhi airport to take them to Singh’s farm.

Trains to places like Ahmedabad, Amritsar and Bengaluru are running full. Chief public relations officer of East Central Railway Rajesh Kumar said, “There is more than 100% occupancy in about 40 pairs of trains originating from Bihar these days. In some trains, the occupancy is above than 150%.”

According to an estimate, around 40 lakh migrant workers returned to Bihar from different states during the lockdown. And nearly 20 lakh of them were provided financial aid by the state government while staying at their places of work. The government had promised job opportunities for those who returned to the state.

According to official data, a total of 193.63 lakh job cards have been issued so far. The state has also created 259.6 lakh man-days under the rural job guarantee scheme—MNREGA. The skill training of returning migrant workers was conducted and instructions were also issued to provide jobs for them in big infrastructure projects, employment schemes, “Jal-Jivan-Hariyali’ mission and other work.

IPRD minister Neeraj Kumar said, “Apart from employment (jobs) for poor migrant workers, the state government also arranged for free ration for them and their families for their sustenance. The government has helped them financially as well and efforts were on to make them economically reliant through different welfare schemes.”

Former director of AN Sinha Institute of social study Professor DM Diwakar said, “Lack of employment opportunities are pushing the returnees on a reverse journey to their workplaces. Though both the central and the state governments launched several schemes to provide them with employment (work), they are not sufficient in comparison to the number of returnees.”

Top among the worries are logistical concerns about reaching hospitals and contacting doctors, possibility of the virus affecting the foetus and whether diagnostic tests during pregnancy could enhance the risk of Covid exposure. Many have also been asking the doctors if the virus could get transmitted to the foetus from the mother.A young working couple from New Town called up a gynaecologist asking if it was safe for the wife to conceive during this pandemic and if they should go for an emergency abortion. Another couple from Salt Lake made a frantic call to their gynaecologist fearing his wife has already conceived and in that case would it be safe for the would-be-mother and the unborn child.“With couples now spending more time together, many are getting pregnant. I am getting numerous calls from couples asking if pregnancy during this pandemic will be safe for both the mother and the child,” said Samir Kumar Ray, obstetrician and gynaecologist at CMRI Hospital. Couples want to know if Covid-19 could affect the foetus, added gynaecologist Basab Mukherjee, vice-president of FOGSI (Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India). “These concerns are obvious but we haven’t come across any evidence of risk to suggest that couples should postpone pregnancy,” he said. The logistical barriers posed a bigger problem than clinical issues, he felt. “Hospital visits, exposure to crowd during such visits could indeed be risky. We have been pointing that out to couples,” Mukherjee added.Doctors said there was yet no evidence of mother-to-foetus transmission during pregnancy or birth. But if a pregnant woman gets severe symptoms like high-grade fever, it may increase the risk of birth defects, they said.Fertility experts said a good number of couples who had failed to conceive naturally and were planning to go for ART (assisted reproductive technology) have conceived naturally during the lockdown. “Natural conception rate among the so-called infertile couples has gone up during this pandemic. They are happy but are anxious at the same time as to how the virus will impact the pregnancy,” said fertility consultant Kausiki Ray Sarkar, in charge of the fertility unit at AMRI. On the other hand, the lockdown has resulted in many unwanted pregnancies due to lack of access to contraception, pointed out Mukherjee. “Most couples have opted out of abortion since they feel visiting hospitals is unsafe. So, we won’t be surprised if we see a baby boom in about six-seven months from now,” said Mukherjee.Doctors, however, said that like any other ailment, pregnancy issues can also be handled taking all precautionary measure and hospitals are gearing up for that. But any viral pathogen, Ray Sarkar added, during pregnancy makes the foetus vulnerable during the organogenesis stage (organ development). “We are asking couples not to get worked up as we have to live with the virus for now. Hospitals are gearing up facilities for safer deliveries and better monitoring options,” said Samir Kumar Ray.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pregnancies-on-the-rise-but-virus-fear-a-worry-for-would-be-moms/articleshow/77827530.cms

With a lot many people already getting infected and recovering from Covid-19 , those who are getting infected now have a reference point that is preventing them from panicking. This may also be one of the many reasons behind the decline in the number of fresh cases.“More and more patients, particularly those who are young and mildly symptomatic , are skipping the test. They are getting in touch with their doctors for advice and medicines while isolating themselves at home,” said a senior doctor.When Avinash Agarwal and his family realized they had lost their sense of smell and taste on August 14, they did not panic. Instead, they isolated themselves and got in touch with their doctor. “We were not feeling any physical discomfort, so we asked our doctor if it was really necessary to get ourselves tested. We are regularly walking in our room briskly and checking the saturation level along with having all the vitamin supplements,” said Avinash, 38.While doctors believe this is the right approach, they suggest constant monitoring for elderly patients and those with co-morbidities. “For them, condition can worsen in a matter of a few hours, so the basic parameters must be screened,” said AMRI Hospitals consultant Debashish Saha.Many people TOI spoke to said the gap between the onset of symptoms, getting the test done and receiving the report was almost one week or more, making the results irrelevant in the case of mildly symptomatic patients. “Several people in our family received their reports almost four days after the test and almost seven to eight days after the onset of symptoms.

Bhopal: Incessant rain in Bhopal, Sehore and nearby areas that led to a sudden rise in water level in Upper Lake, resulted in inundation of catchment areas and waterlogging of state capital’s largest Covid-19 care hospital — Chirayu medical college.

Movement of vehicles and people on the hospital campus was affected till Saturday afternoon. Patients admitted for Covid-care in the hospital were not affected, claimed hospital administration.

Social networking sites went viral with images of waterlogging at the hospital. Almost knee-deep water filled the lower decks of the hospital which subsided only after eight sluice gates of Upper Lake were opened. “Covid-care centre where patients are admitted is on the third floor and patients were not impacted in anyway. Movement of private vehicles was hit,” said Chirayu medical college, director, Dr Ajay Goenka. One of the patients, among about 650 admitted for Covid-19 treatment, is MP health minister, Prabhuram Choudhary. “We will continue to provide Covid-19 treatment,” said Dr Goenka. When contacted, health department officials did not comment on the issue.

JAIPUR: A man was found hanging from the roof of his house with his hands tied together in Sawai Madhopur district on Saturday. His family has registered a murder case . The deceased has been identified as 40-year-old Hemraj Gurjar who hailed from Badpur village under Khandar police station area in Sawai Madhopur.

Rakesh Rajora, circle officer, Sawai Madhopur rural police area, said, “When the body was found, Hemraj’s hands were tied, while he was hanging from the fan in his room. We found no suicide note .

According to officials, the deceased had gone to sleep the night before and was found by his wife when she woke up in the morning. “At present, we do not know the reason behind the suicide or murder though it does appear that there was something suspicious about the death as when a person commits suicide, it is impossible to tie up hands. There was some kind of manipulation here and we are going to get to the bottom of it,” said the official. Cops are also questioning the victim’s family though they have not found motive behind the death.

Elaborating further, the official said, “The family has been unable to give us too many details yet though they have named members of the same community as accused in the FIR.

The exact reason behind the supposed murder or suicide is yet to be determined.” The deceased’s body was kept in the mortuary and handed over to the family on Saturday after the post-mortem.

BHOPAL: Narmada is swelling all over as the floodgates of all the dams over the river have been opened after heavy rainfall in the river catchment. From Bargi, the huge reservoir in the upstream in Jabalpur to Omkareshwer power project, these dams are releasing millions of cusec water in the past 24 hours.

Narmada was flowing several feet over the danger mark in Hoshangabad as Bargi, Tawa and Barna dams were continuously releasing water, leading to floods in the river.

Meanwhile, heavy rainfall is predicted in the catchment of Narmada in the downstream in the next 24 hours. Following heavy rainfall in Mandla and Dindori, 17 sluice gates of Bargi dam were opened and 6800 cusecs water was released . The water flowing into the dam from its catchment in the upstream was 7600 cusecs. The sluice gates are likely to remain open till Sunday morning. At 4pm on Saturday, Bargi was brimming with 422.45 metres against its capacity of 422.76 metres.

Chief minister Shivraj Singh Couhan after aerial survey of the Narmada, said, “The river was flowing over the danger mark in Hoshanabad as all the dam gates were opened”.

At 5pm, the river was flowing at 982 feet. In fact, Hoshangabad was marooned after the three dams continued to release water. The city was cut off from all the four directions on Saturday. Similar conditions prevailed in Harda, the neighbouring district of Hoshangabad in the downstream.

As large volumes of water continue to be released, the ISP reservoir was filled to the brim, leading to the opening of all the floodgates on the dam. This is for the second time that the dam water was released in the morning on Saturday. On Saturday morning, the flood cell of the ISP informed that “The outflow from all 20 gates will be increased from existing 18720 cumecs to 21700 cumecs in addition to 1870 cumecs from power house.”

All the 21 sluiced gates of Omkareshwer power project were also opened. This would fill the mighty Sardar Sarovar dam, leading to floods in Narmada valley.

The duo was supposed to return in March but since all international passenger flights to Indian were suspended in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic breakout, they got stranded and returned home on August 24.Upon their return, the woman's husband, 46, a resident of Damgarhi village, who works in Mumbai, approached police accusing his wife of having “illicit” relationship with the accused, Sandeep Singh , 36, also a Pilibhit resident, and charging the accused with forging documents to obtain a passport in his name. One of the couple's children studies in Australia.Taking serious note of the allegations, superintendent of police Jai Prakash Yadav ordered an investigation into the matter by a local intelligence unit (LIU) inspector and registration of an FIR based on the husband's complaint.According to the complainant, he has been working in Mumbai for the past 20 years and occasionally visits his wife, who lives in a farmhouse and looks after his ancestral land.“When I returned to Pilibhit on May 18, my wife was not at home. I came to know from Sandeep’s family that both had gone to Australia. To find out whether Sandeep forged documents to obtain a passport in my name to visit Australia, I purposely applied for a passport on August 24 at the Bareilly-based passport office. My suspicion was ascertained by the passport authorities, who told me that a passport in my name was already issued on February 2, 2019,” he said.The SP said Gajraula police and LIU inspector Kanchan Rawat would focus their probe on how a passport in the name of the complainant was issued despite identity-checking at multiple levels.Earlier, one of the main accused of the Nabha jailbreak case Gurjeet Singh Ladda had also succeeded in obtaining a fake passport in the name of one Surjeet Singh, a resident of Sherpur Makrandpur village under Puranpur kotwali in Pilibhit, four years ago.

VARANASI: Continuing the crackdown on the encroachment of land and violation of rules by jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari’s family members and aides, the government demolished the boundary wall of the premises given on rent to Food Corporation of India (FCI) in Mau for running its godown amid tight security arrangements on Saturday.

District magistrate Mau, Gyan Prakash Tripathi told TOI, “Mukhtar’s wife had bought 330 sqmt land of people of Scheduled Caste without taking the mandatory permission from DM in such cases. The land was bought in violation of rules to meet the norms of the required area for FCI godown. The accused are being issued a notice to pay Rs 26.43 lakh to compensate losses caused to government property.”

Earlier, a joint team of district administration and land revenue department officials reached Rajdepur area of Raini gram sabha in Dakshintola police station area with a heavy contingent of police force. The official demolished the boundary wall of the godown premises owned by Mukhtar’s wife and reclaimed the land, said police officials.

The case in this connection had been lodged at Dakshintola police station on July 9 under Sections 419, 420, 433, 434, 447, 467, 468, 471 of IPC and 3/4 of Prevention of Damages to Public Property Act, the DM said.

“The godown is registered in the name of Vikas Constructions owned by Atif Raja, Mukhtar’s wife Afsha Ansari, Anwar Shehjaz, Ravindra Narain Singh , and Jakir Hussain of Ghazipur. This land belonged to gram sabha and had been allotted to SC people,” Tripathi added.

The land of the accused was insufficient to fulfil the criteria for FCI godown, so they bought adjacent land of some SCs without taking due permission from DM, took possession and constructed boundary wall to include it in the godown, said officials.

An illegal slaughter house was demolished in Mau on Friday while two buildings of Ansari’s sons had been razed in Lucknow on Thursday.

84,['30/08/2020'],Deserted handloom street awaits last-minute shoppers,"A worker at a handloom-weaving unit at Thannimoodu near Balaramapuram

Thiruvananthapuram: There is wry humour in the way K Manikandan , owner of one of the oldest handloom stores at Balaramapuram speaks about having lunch during Onam season . “We seldom ate during days preceding Onam. We all would be busy packing items for transport and there would be so much people milling around the shop. These days we eat our lunch at leisure,” he says, trying to smile. His words reflect the uneasy calm at Ottatheruvu where handloom stores carrying decades of legacy dot the recently interlocked street.

The famed handloom street at Balaramapuram has been quiet for the past five months. No festive occasions — Vishu, Easter, Ramzan and even Onam — have broken the silence here. “We year’s experience is unprecedented. Even during 2018 floods, we managed to pull through. But this Onam has shattered all our expectations,” says Manikandan. To add to the woes, some export orders have fallen through. Some orders from the Gulf and Australia had given a glimmer of hope. None of it materialized, he added.

The age-old wooden shelves in these stores which have carried on this business for generations are now filled with unsold stock. “During Onam, we would demand more stock from our weavers because such used to be the kind of sales. This year, we are left with shelves full with no sale,” says P Kumaraswami, owner of another handloom store.

With stock piling up and sales drying up, master weavers who act as the link between sellers and labourers find themselves in a deep mess. “We are taking debts, pawning what we have to pay bonus to our labourers. They depend on us and their whole lives have been reliant on handloom. We can’t let them down, but we are not sure if we would be able to survive this,” said Krishnakumar, a master weaver. A master weaver will have 25-60 looms under him. Since March, production has been at full throttle because labourers couldn’t find any other work due to lockdown. “I haven’t paid back my loan of Rs 15 lakh for the past five months. I am not sure when I would be able to pay it. All I do is stretch myself to keep my labourers afloat,” said Krishnakumar.

The weavers who hoped for last-minute sales ahead of Onam were in for a shock when the street was closed three weeks ago after being assigned as containment zone. Onam shoppers who ventured to their favourite places had returned seeing police barricades. Last Sunday, restrictions were lifted and the street is back to life. But, business hasn’t picked up. Though all weavers are hopeful, they are not confident that there will be a last-minute rush, an uthrada pachil for purchasing Onakodi.

PUNE: More than 400 recovered Covid-19 patients have registered as plasma donors on a portal launched by the Pune police, benefiting 67 people.

The portal, https://puneplasma.in, a joint initiative by Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham and the then divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar, was launched on July 30 to connect plasma donors and recipients amid a sharp rise in the number of cases in Pune.

“I appeal to citizens to come forward and further the plasma donation initiative,” Venkatesham said. “A Hyderabad-based firm helped us set up the platform. We hope that it makes it easier for [recovered] Covid-19 patients to come forward and donate plasma. Anyone who wants to avail themselves of these services of the portal can log on to it,” deputy commissioner of police (special branch) Mitesh Gatte told TOI.

“Donating plasma isn’t painful; it has no side effects. It can save a person’s life. Plasma demand is likely to increase in the future, keeping in mind that the tally has already crossed the 1 lakh mark in Pune,” Gatte said.

Venkatesham on Saturday felicitated 17 plasma donors at a function organized at the Pune police commissionerate.

Eye experts are recommending a thorough sanitisation of spectacles to get rid of any traces of the novel coronavirus every time one goes out of home as the rogue germ can stay on the eyeglasses for as long as nine days.“One important safety measure one should follow is to cover the mouth and the nose by wearing a mask while moving out. But, equally important is to protect the eyes by wearing eyeglasses, which should be sanitised on returning home,” says Dr Akshay Badakere , ophthalmologist at the LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad.He said eyeglasses could be disinfected by using light dishwasher soap under running water and wipe them out with a microfibre cloth. “When going out, carry hydrogen peroxide solution to disinfect eyeglasses. Do not sanitise eyeglasses with alcohol-based sanitisers meant for hands as they can damage the lenses,” Dr Akshay said.Stating that sanitisation of eyeglasses is important to keep Covid-19 at bay, Dr Akshay said the glasses include prescription ones for refractive errors, plain eyeglasses or specially-designed protective goggles and sunglasses. All these types of eyeglasses prevent aerosols from entering eyes.“Unlike eyewear, most of the face masks are disposable or reusable, and hence they are a lesser source of infection. But, as there is no such option for daily wear glasses, we generally continue to wear them again and again. It is important to take necessary precautions to ensure that they don’t become carriers of infection. Any lapse can put one at risk of infection as the virus can enter the body through the eyes,” he said, emphasising the need for disinfection of eyeglasses.Dr Akshay said research studies have revealed that the novel coronavirus stays on the eyeglasses for up to nine days. “We should clean our eyeglasses as frequently as possible, just like the way we keep our hands clean,” he added.He suggested that one should always wear eyeglasses before stepping out of home, and not frequently touch the glasses. “Ensure that eyeglasses are perfectly adjusted to your face before wearing to avoid unnecessary adjustments by hand.

JAIPUR: Plasma therapy and Remdesivir and Tocilizumab injections have emerged as effective components in treating critical Covid-19 patients. Doctors on Saturday said plasma therapy and the injections are showing good results, especially when given to critically ill patients.

“Till now, 335 patients have been given plasma therapy, while 3,877 have been administered Remdesivir injections. Likewise, we have also given Tocilizumab injections to 232 patients so far,” said a senior officer of the medical and health department. Hospitals now have 33 more plasma units, while people who were treated for Covid are also coming to donate their plasma everyday at various blood banks.

SMS Medical College principal Dr Sudhir Bhandari , who also heads the core team treating Covid patients, said, “If a patient needed anti-inflammatory, anti-viral drugs and even steroids at times, some of them were given plasma therapy and the two injections. Let me tell you that plasma therapy and the injections are showing good results on the patients on ventilator support. The therapy has helped us bring down fatalities.”

Experts stated that the success rate in plasma therapy or the injections or both in Covid patients is more than 70 per cent. “If a patient was brought on time and has been given timely plasma therapy and injections, he has shown very good results. In some of the cases, we had seen that private hospitals had referred very critical patients,” said a senior doctor treating Covid patients on condition of anonymity.

It may be recalled that the health department had already launched a campaign to boost plasma therapy to prevent fatalities due to Covid. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) too had praised the state government for successfully using plasma therapy on Covid patients.

SMS Medical College and its core team involved in the treatment of Covid have successfully used the Tocilizumab and Remdesivir injections on critical patients so far. Also, the government has designated six medical colleges in the state which would only supply these injections.

Moreover, district hospitals and their doctors will have to seek recommendations from medical colleges to decide if the injections could be administered to some patient or not.

90,['30/08/2020'],Appeal against demolition of Anjuna structure dismissed,"Panaji: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has dismissed an appeal filed by owners of a guesthouse in Anjuna against demolition orders of their structure issued by the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA).

The tribunal has noted that the GCZMA order is in accordance with the law and that there is no merit in the plea filed by the guesthouse owners stating that the state government had not carried out the exercise of demarcating the High Tide Line (HTL).

“The fact remains that the structure directed to be demolished by the authority was found to be unauthorised within a meaning of Sub Clause 1 and required to be demolished. Therefore, the finding recorded by GCZMA and the consequential direction given on their behalf is unassailable,” NGT said.

The tribunal has said that it is therefore not necessary to dilate on the argument as to whether CRZ policy was actually executed in Goa.

“But since it was found that the construction as aforesaid was found unauthorised and illegal thus, the order is passed accordingly. We see no irregularity and illegality in the order under challenge. No substantial question of law of great public importance arises for further consideration. Hence, this appeal must fail and the same therefore is dismissed with no order as to cost,” NGT stated.

The tribunal noted that directions were issued to state authorities in a Goa Foundation case to take action against unauthorised structures and constructions put up on the land falling within CRZ 3 in Goa after February 19, 1991. The directions to the state by the court stated that permission can be granted only for repair and renovation of existing dwelling units in such areas.

Following this, the tribunal action according to rules should be taken against structures other than the original structure as on February 19, 1991, which are not in compliance and are in violation of the CRZ notification.

“In light of the above order, we see that the order passed by GCZMA is in accordance with the law and showcause notice was issued in accordance with the provisions and after giving an opportunity of hearing the said order was passed. The state has demarcated the High Tide Line and the CRZ notification 2011 is executed. Accordingly, we don’t find any merit in the case,” NGT said.

The shadow council, while raising the issue of the poor state of Margao town roads, has pointed out that while potholes have been recently filled up, loose material hasn’t been cleared from the roads.

“This creates granite dust which is a very serious health hazard,” convenor Savio Coutinho said.

The patchwork done on potholed roads will not last for long, Coutinho said, adding that loose gravel on the roads further damages its surface when vehicles ply over it.

The shadow council warned authorities to address the issue, failing which, it will be compelled to take to the streets.

The council last month had presented the PWD engineers with a certificate for excellence last month when they carried out repairs of the road junction near Navelim Church to highlight the negligence and repeated damage to the same area.

Coutinho pointed out that there existed three drains at this spot where one was buried at the time of road widening eight years back and the other two drains haven’t been desilted for the last several years.

“As there is no proper drainage system for the storm water to drain off, and with the movement of heavy vehicles the asphalt gets dismantled during the very first showers,” Coutinho added.

Thiruvananthapuram: When Vishnu J Raju decided to celebrate his father’s birthday, he chose to present him a gift he would cherish. On Saturday, Vishnu, an MBA graduate , ran 53km for his father Raju Raghavan , who is also a fitness enthusiast and runner, as birthday gift.

A native of Kadappakada, Kollam, Vishnu (25) covered the route Kollam Musaliar Park- Kadappakada- Chinnakada- Kollam Beach- Chinnakada- KSRTC Bus stand- Ashramam Maidanam, six times to cover the distance of 53km. He started the run at 1am and completed it by 7am. He is a member of Soles of Kollam, a runners’ group which supported his run.

“I got motivated into running after watching my father, who used to participate in such activities. I have participated in half marathons in the past and have also completed an unofficial marathon distance run from Ashramam Maidanam to Punalur hanging bridge. I had registered for the Tuffman solo run challenge of 50 km and decided to cover 3km more as it was my father’s 53rd birthday. All my family members are active runners and participates in running activities,” said Vishnu.

Vishnu, a student at Kerala State Civil Service Academy, is now busy pursuing his dream for civil service. The run was conducted following Covid-19 protocol and distance covered was recorded virtually. “It was a wonderful experience. I chose the route for the run as it was comfortable for me. The idea behind the run was to motivate youngsters to take part in running which is good for fitness and increases lung capacity, especially in times of Covid. The run is called ultramarathon, which is more than 42-km marathon. There are people in the state who actively participate in half-marathons and marathons, but there are not many who participate in ultramarathons,” added Vishnu.

PUNE: The state government is planning to cap the cost of RT-PCR test to detect Covid-19 cases in private laboratories at Rs1,200 as the Indian Council of Medical Research has given permission to several indigenous firms to manufacture its kits.

State health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday said, “We are planning to bring the cost down of the RT-PCR test to a maximum of Rs1,200, but finally it may be between Rs1,200 and Rs1,500. The central government is keen on all states reducing the charges as testing has increased exponentially in the country.”

He said the state government had earlier brought down the cost of the RT-PCR test to Rs1,900 from Rs2,200. A fresh notification on the further reduction of cost would be issued soon, said Tope.

Maharashtra, having maximum Covid-19 caseload in the country, conducts the highest number of tests every day among all the states. The state has been conducting 29,043 tests per million population as against the country’s average of 27,553 per million. The Pune district administration has been conducting around 68,163 tests per million population.

Tope said the state would persist with its strategy to increase the testing. He said a Mumbai-based and a Thane-based company jointly developed an RT-PCR testing kit recently. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV) have approved their product. “We shall push for kits from more such indigenous companies,” said the minister.

The local manufacturers awaiting approval to their test kits claimed that the indigenous companies’ products would help ramp up the country’s testing capability further.

The ICMR and NIV are giving approval to the kits of indigenous firms following stringent guidelines, which rule out the possibility of false positive or false negative results. “These kits are on a par with global kits in terms of quality and adaptability,” said a manufacturer.

Speaking in Kolhapur on Saturday, Fadnavis said, “Every minister in the state government is criticising Modi to hide personal failures. They should know that Maharashtra is the biggest beneficiary of PM Cares funds.”

He said he has no issue with Thackeray not moving out to check the situation but added that people in authority must regularly interact with officers to get things done.

Besides, the state capital saw 240 positive cases taking its total to 10,260.

Attributing the rise in the cases to the intensified random sampling in the rural interiors across the state, health officials stated that recovery rate is also increasing. However, the officials also added that people are still not serious enough in Jaipur and many are very casual about the idea of social distancing, sanitisation using masks.

“I think the police and law enforcement agencies across the state should be strict against the violators as many people are still not following the SOPs. Also, asymptomatic patients need to be identified as they are working as virus carriers to senior citizens and children,” said a senior officer of the health department on the condition of anonymity.

“Random sampling has also been initiated and intensified across the state. This is the reason why there has been a spike in the number of cases for the past 30 days. Earlier, we had witnessed more than 1,200 cases, then over 1,300 cases for few days and now we are above 1,400 cases. Also, we have a testing facility of taking over 50,000 samples per day which will further facilitate us in detection of cases. Timely detection will help us bring down the fatality rate,” said a senior officer of health department.

With 240 fresh cases, Jaipur’s total count now stands at 10,260. “With two deaths in the city, the total number Covid deaths in Jaipur stands at 271,” said an officer.

Air Marshal Bhushan Gokhale (retired) and his wife Meghna would walk from “JM Road to Laxmi Road” – their rechristened bedrooms – to cover 3km each day in the summer gone by.Gokhale stepped out just twice in these five months. “We got the essentials delivered at home. It has become a norm now,” he said.Ditto with Parveen Kazi, the president of Rajgriha ‘B’ Housing Society, tucked off Salunke Vihar Road. “Once I stepped out towards the beginning of the lockdown to get a vendor to sell vegetables on the society premises. The second time I had to buy some essentials that my helps were unable to get.”N Vedaballi (85) of the same society went out on March 23, the day before the nationwide lockdown started, till she went to see a doctor on August 25. The octogenarian gave her favourite strolls in the society a miss all this while. “She missed soaking in the sun as she walked on the terrace only these five months. Pending bank work another worry of hers,” said Vedaballi’s daughter-in-law.Ninety-year-old Keshav Patwardhan and his better-half Sunita Patwardhan (81) have gone outside their Alankar Society home in Karvenagar just once since March 24 to seek medical attention. The lockdown was a puzzle for Keshav.“A sort of mental agony crept in after my father’s morning walks with friends at Sarasbaug stopped. He missed interactions with mates terribly,” said UGC vice-chairperson Bhushan Patwardhan, the son of Keshav and Sunita. “My mother missed evening visits to temples. To dodge the monotony, she started walking on the terrace with my father as the dusk dawned each day,” he told TOI over the phone from Delhi.Son away in the US, a slice or two of anguish pained 60-plus Jayashree Chavan of Anand Vihar Phase-I in Vadgaon Hingne. Home alone, Chavan’s prime support all these months has been her tenants. The only time she went to buy essentials to a neighbourhood shop since the nationwide lockdown, she was hurt. “A rope separated me and the shopkeeper, the same woman with whom I interacted regularly. Our hair turned grey together,” said Chavan.A member of a bhajan group, she misses her music team. “I don’t feel like playing harmonium and practising at home any more. Those short interactions from the balcony with people strolling after supper have also stopped,” said Chavan.Techie Swaraj Roy (41) of Pimple Saudagar didn’t step out from mid-March. During the peak of lockdown, he got the essentials delivered at home from a nearby store. Then, e-tail became his mainstay. “Now, my father, in his 70s, goes out to get essentials. I still don’t go out,” Roy said, adding that he gave his parents a haircut.Bhushan Gokhale cooked to give his wife, Meghna, a break when the cook was off. “My two sons – one in Capetown and the other in the US – just did not believe me,” he said.Bird-watching from their balcony overlooking the Kamala Nehru Park was another enriching experience for the couple. “Colourful bulbuls unforeseen hitherto flew by,” said Gokhales .Countdown begins to see bubbly Pune back at its best with some enduring moments of life in solitude.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77831767,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-262853,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/from-jm-rd-to-laxmi-rd-a-long-walk-within-4-walls/articleshow/77828712.cms

110,['30/08/2020'],Row over emptying renovated Sursagar,"Vadodara: From raising a stink and controversy over it being emptied to facilitate work, a controversy has now emerged over the unexpectedly high quantity of water filled in the renovated Sursagar. The water had submerged the walkway along the periphery of the pond and is being emptied to ensure there is sufficient space for any more inflow of water.

But officials of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) said that a major issue was that an outlet of the pond that used to carry excess water towards a storm water drain in the Lakdipul area was not functioning. Sources said that attempts were being made to fix this system so that water could be drained out of the pond whenever needed. In the meantime, a pump is being used to empty the pond.

Located in the heart of the city, Sursagar has been mired in a controversy ever since work began on the historical water body.

Environment activists had expressed concern over inlets of water into the pond and feared that these may not be functioning properly. Also, emptying the pond and then refilling it to some extent for its inauguration in February had raised eyebrows.

But quite contrary to the fears, it has come to light that Sursagar got filled faster this year despite the claims of an increased capacity.

It was claimed that after desilting, the pond’s capacity had increased despite its surface area reducing. But even this did not prove sufficient this monsoon, despite the city still not having reached its average rainfall figure.

Sources said that a major reason for the pond overflowing was that it was receiving a large amount of water from the M G Road and Laheripura Gate side as compared to previous years. It is believed that some blockage in the storm water drain that used to carry water towards Mangalbazaar may have been the reason for this water flowing towards the pond.

“Also, new storm water drains were laid around the pond. This ensured all water flowed into the pond unlike previous years when a lot of water flowed away from it on the road towards Dandiabazaar,” said a VMC official.

115,['30/08/2020'],Pune: Common blood thinner drug proves lifesaver during Covid,"More on Covid-19

PUNE: A common blood-thinning drug — Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) — has emerged as a potential therapeutic treatment for Covid-19 patients.Doctors said the drug — as a subcutaneous injection — has helped reduce hospitalisation periods, improved recovery rate and has significantly cut the rate of sudden deaths by over 90%. Encouraged by the outcomes, specialists TOI spoke to said doctors nationwide were now using the drug as a prophylactic (preventive) therapy to counter blood inflammation and clotting — two main complications SARS-CoV-2 has been causing in the human body.The doctors’ logic is simple: It is easier to prevent new blood clots/inflammation from forming, compared to treating existing blood clots or inflammation. Pune-based critical care expert Subhal Dixit said, “Post-mortem reports from Italy showed that Covid-19 causes small blood clots (micro-thrombus) in blood vessels, along with inflammation.”Dixit said, “Doctors in India have been using blood thinners, mainly LMWH, since the start of the pandemic. But their use has now increased manifold. Evidence of their efficacy is also growing.”Dixit is a former national president of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine (ISCCM), a pan-India body of intensivists.The formation of clots in the lung vessels leads to respiratory complications. “Similarly, small blood clots in vessels in the heart, brain and the kidneys can trigger heart attacks, brain strokes and acute kidney injury in moderate to critically ill Covid-19 patients. The LMWH has proven to be extremely beneficial in averting such complications,” Dixit said.A blood test called D-dimer is first carried out to rule out blood clots in patients. In Covid-19 cases, the D-dimer is often elevated.“The elevation of D-dimer is indicative of a risk of blood vessel inflammation and blood clotting. The LMWH, along with antiplatelet drugs, has countered both complications and has significantly cut Covid-linked mortality,” Rohtak-based critical care expert, Dhruv Chaudhary, the national president of the ISCCM told TOI.These evolving treatment strategies, including the use of LMWH, have helped doctors ensure maximum Covid-19 recoveries.Mumbai-based Nanavati hospital’s intensivist, Ujwala Mhatre said, “In the marathon that is Covid treatment, anticoagulation drugs such as LMWH are valuable tools to prevent multiple mechanisms involved in Covid-associated thrombosis.”Delhi-based critical care expert Yatin Mehta head of the ICU at Medanta hospital said, ""Small preventive dose of LMWH to admitted patients with increased D-dimer has given remarkable results. A few critical patients need a larger dose though.""Critical care expert Kapil Borawake, said, “The LMWH has emerged as the drug of choice — a sort of pre-requisite prophylactic during the treatment of hospitalised Covid patients. Its administration should not be delayed during the early phase of the illness. Recovered patients with pre-existing conditions are also advised to continue the drug in oral form even after discharge.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77829631,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-159869,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/common-blood-thinner-drug-proves-lifesaver-during-covid/articleshow/77828768.cms
116,['30/08/2020'],Mini-clusters in residential colonies shape up in city,"Thiruvananthapuram: While lesser tests mean lesser Covid-19 positives in coastal clusters mini-community clusters are forming within the city wards . The corporation wards which have reported over 100 cases daily for the past few weeks are now recording small clusters centred on residential colonies Around 15 positive cases, including a ten-month-old baby, have been cumulatively reported from a retail chain and two housing colonies based in Kesavadasapuram in the past one week. Some of the contacts of a person who tested positive were traced to a marriage function held at a hotel in Ulloor. The health officials say that restrictions on number of participants and longer time period for holding reception would mean little because silent carriers within close family circles could lead to a spread. Over 250 contacts have so far been tested after cases were confirmed at Kesavadasapuram.The officials said that contact tracing helped them in early isolation of contacts and containment of the area, and possibility of a huge spread has been negated for the time being. There was also an instance where a person who had reportedly undergone testing for Covid-19 later attended the wedding function. Lack of knowledge about isolation measures to be complied following testing often leads to such seemingly harmless acts, the officials pointed out. The contacts were also traced to a retail chain, and so far there have been three positives. The early identification of contacts, followed by their isolation, prevented further spread in the shopping establishment.Many of the positive cases are asymptomatic and nine persons have opted for home quarantine as per new SoP issued by district administration. Source of infection in two persons in the area remains unknown. Rajaji Nagar, where the first bout of cases was reported in July, has reported new cases. A staff at General Hospital, an employee of a cooperative institution and a contingent worker of city corporation have tested positive, followed by their contacts. With living conditions posing enough challenges for isolation of contacts, the health team and ward councillors had worked together to house contacts in a separate facility. This ploy doesn’t seem to work anymore as cases rise and primary contacts are testing positive.There is also no need for secondary contacts to remain under home isolation. However, officials point out that the nature of conditions in a densely inhabited slum could warrant different set of methods to check spread of infection. At Karamana, 31 cases were reported from one cluster and effective containment has so far been fruitful. One positive emerged out of 50 samples recently, indicative of a dip in infection. Colonies along the streets of Manacaud are also reporting new cases, especially among those who aged above 50 or 70. The source of infection in some of these cases is unknown as their family members have tested negative.",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77827625,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-68677,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mini-clusters-in-residential-colonies-shape-up-in-city/articleshow/77827626.cms

KANPUR: A three-member inquiry commission, headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice (retd) B S Chauhan, set up by the apex court to probe Vikas Dubey encounter and the circumstances that led to it, asked the district police to provide a list of movable and immovable assets of persons associated with the slain gangster.

Police sources told TOI that the Commission had asked Chaubeypur and Shivli police both to furnish the details of the movable and non-movable assets of 53 persons close to slain gangster Vikas Dubey.

The move comes close on the heels of the visit by the Commission of the encounter sites including Kanshiram Newada, where gangsters aides Prem Prakash and Atul Dubey , Sachendi where slain gangster Vikas and Panki where Prabhat Mishra, were gunned down by the police.

“The Commission has given a list of 53 people associated directly and indirectly to gangster to district and police officials and asked them to ensure compliance,” said a senior official, who added, “The copies of the list of 53 persons have also been issued to Chaubeypur and Shivli police.”

Inspector Shivli Veerpal Singh Tomar confirmed reporters that they have been asked to furnish details of the movable and immovable assets soon. “We have been also asked to provide details about the mode/source of acquisition as well as value of the movable and immovable property at the time of acquisition or its present value,” he said.

The police found out that he used to arrange a huge amount of cash for Dubey on short notice and also used to provide him with luxury cars.

124,['30/08/2020'],Villager helps avert train accident in UP after he spots a crack on rail track,"BAREILLY: A timely intervention by a villager in UP helped avert a major train accident in Moradabad on Saturday. Chandrasen Saini , a plumber by profession, was on his way to relieve himself when he spotted a crack on the railway track. An Amritsar-Howrah parcel train with two military compartments attached was scheduled to cross the track.

""I started waving a red cloth and the loco pilot managed to apply the brakes on time,"" the villager from Katghar said. The military compartments had a few Army personnel on board. The tracks are now being repaired.

The parcel train with 24 coaches was moving from Amritsar to Howrah and was crossing Bhaisiya village under Katghar in UP on the Delhi-Lucknow down railway line when the villager raised the alarm. The incident occurred around 6 am.

“There was some kind of sparkle near the railway track when a train was passing through it. As the train passed, I went to take a closer look and found that there was a crack. Thereafter, another train was approaching the track and I sensed that an accident was possible due to the wide gap. I waved a red cloth at the loco pilot who also sensed some trouble and immediately applied the brakes,” Saini said. Soon, senior officials and the maintenance team rushed to the spot.

Divisional railway manager of Moradabad, Tarun Prakash told TOI, “After learning about the incident, train movement on the concerned railway track was suspended for around three hours. Maintenance work was carried out. A few soldiers were onboard the two coaches next to the engine. No one was hurt. The train left Moradabad around 9 am. A departmental probe has been ordered. Action will be taken accordingly.”

Moreover, similar incidents have taken place here in the past. Last month, two carriages of Rajpura-bound goods train had a breakdown which led to derailment of coaches at Chandausi railway station. In December, two coaches of Moradabad-Kathgodam passenger train had derailed while shunting on the outer yard of the Moradabad railway station .

Chairman of the Cavelossim biodiversity management committee Dixon Vaz said that the beach cleaning agency, Karnataka Commercial and Industrial Corporation (KCIC), “has failed in totality in keeping the coastline clean”.

When TOI contacted tourism director Menino D’Souza on Saturday, he later sent pictures and stated that the beach cleaning personnel were in the process of clearing the waste at Benaulim beach. However, when TOI visited the beach at 6pm, the waste was still lying on the beach. When this was brought to D’Souza’s notice, he said he will see the pictures and would take necessary action.

While criticising KCIC, Vaz said that as a seafarer president, he had submitted a proposal to tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar to hand over the beach cleaning project to the seafarer’s association, stating they would get the work done for half the amount being paid to the current contractor. “I told the tourism minister that we would engage retired seafarers, their spouses and locals to clean the beach, but our proposal was rejected, and the result of engaging an outstation agency is for all to see.”

TOI had recently highlighted that large quatities of waste was strewn along the entire Salcete beach stretch, from Betalbatim to Cavelossim. Plastics, cement bags used for sand bagging shacks get entangled in nets, and ropes discarded in the sea get washed ashore.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast only scattered rain for Vidarbha till September 1.Amravati, which had over (-)20% rain deficiency till August 28, got good showers on August 29. This helped the district’s seasonal rainfall to come within the normal range. Still, it currently has a rain shortfall of (-)19%. Rainfall departure of 19% on the either side is considered normal as per the IMD.Anupam Kashyapi, the head of weather, IMD, Pune, told TOI, “Vidarbha may record only scattered rainfall during the next three days, but the 25% deficiency in two of its districts is nevertheless likely to be compensated. However, there are chances of the two districts again slipping into the deficient zone thereafter.”Kashyapi said Akola, Yavatmal and Amravati had been rain-deficient from the beginning of the monsoon. “Vidarbha and Marathwada are known for less rainfall, but the two regions received good rain this monsoon barring some parts, including these districts. The systems over the Bay of Bengal skirted these districts, located in the northeast of Vidarbha. The systems either moved from their north or south, which impeded the rain here,” he added.Amit Naphade, the chief executive officer of Krushi Vikas Va Gramin Prashikshan Sanstha, said, “As the rainfall was more or less normal in most parts of Vidarbha, it might not affect kharif crops but could have an impact on the rabi season.”A total of 14 districts in the state, including three in Marathwada, had excess to large excess rainfall so far this monsoon.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77832591,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-368805,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/17-excess-rain-in-maha-this-monsoon-shortfall-in-2-dists/articleshow/77827639.cms
136,['30/08/2020'],HC turns down plea for ‘tazia’ processions in view of pandemic,"PRAYAGRAJ: Expressing grave concern over the spread of corona pandemic, the Allahabad high court on Saturday dismissed a PIL seeking permission to take out ‘ tazia ’ processions during Muharram.In the PILs, the petitioners Roshan Khan and others had also challenged two state government orders (GOs) dated August 10 and August 23, 2020, insofar as they prohibit members of their community from taking out Muharram processions.They had sought to issue a direction to the state authorities to perform religious mourning rituals/practice connected with Muharram, during the period of 10 days, i.e., up to August 30, 2020, amid the pandemic restrictions in Uttar Pradesh.Dismissing the PILs filed by Khan and many others, a division bench comprising Justice Shashi Kant Gupta and Justice Shamim Ahmed observed, “The pandemic is spreading like wild fire, despite harsh lockdowns. We are standing naked at the shore and don’t know when the huge wave of corona may sweep us into the deep sea. We really don’t know what tomorrow holds. Adoption of safe practices is needed to win over the health crisis. We need to understand the art of living with the coronavirus .”Elaborating the constitutional aspect, the court observed, “Although the complete prohibition of practices which are essential to our religions is an extraordinary measure, it is very much in proportion to the unprecedented situation we are faced with, owing to the pandemic. The right to practise and propagate religion has been made subject to public order, morality and health, even under the Constitution of India.”Rejecting the plea of the petitioners that the restrictions imposed by the UP government are discriminatory in nature and only one community has been targeted in the aforesaid GOs, the court observed, “A bare perusal of the notifications dated August 10, 2020, and August 23, 2020, issued by the state government, clearly indicates that the same yardstick has been adopted for all religious communities and they have been restricted from carrying on any processions or jhankis or activities that have a danger of large congregations that may lead to a spread of the pandemic- Covid-19.”Further, “It indicates that no processions or jhankis have been permitted during the Janmastami festival. Similarly, it further indicates that during the festival for Ganesh Chaturthi too, the Hindu community has been prohibited from erecting any pooja pandals and from installing any statues/idols. Likewise, the Muslim community has been prohibited from taking out processions/tazias during Muharram.”The petitioners also took the plea that the apex court had allowed the devotees access to the places of worship and permitted the annual chariot procession at the Jagannath Temple, Puri besides, recently permitting the offer of Paryushan prayers in three Jain temples in Mumbai, hence the prohibition is arbitrary especially when the proposed rituals can be regulated by prescribing reasonable restrictions, like limiting the number of people to carry out the tazias till Karbala for burial.Rejecting their pleas, the court observed, “In this regard it may be noted that the apex court had not passed any general directions, but the permission to carry out the annual chariot procession (Rath Yatra), pertained to a specific place, Puri, and only from one point to another. However, the present case is clearly distinguishable from the aforesaid cases since it pertains to the entire Uttar Pradesh state and is not confined to one or a few districts.”Lastly, the court observed, “Therefore, it is with a heavy heart that we hold that in these testing times, it is not possible to lift the prohibition by providing any guidelines for regulating the mourning rituals/practice connected with the 10th day of Muharram. We must hope and trust that God would perceive our restraint in our customary practices, not as a slight, but as an act of compassion for our brothers and sisters and give us the opportunity to celebrate all festivals with greater faith and fervour in future. It is only together with cooperation, understanding and support, we as ‘One Nation’, can emerge stronger from these treacherous times and overcome this season of darkness.”",allahabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77832213,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-43589,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-turns-down-plea-for-tazia-processions-in-view-of-pandemic/articleshow/77827657.cms

It has now come down to 750 tonnes,” PCMC chief health officer Anil Roy said.Roy further said the reduced waste generation was a “blessing in disguise”, as many of its frontline staffers were infected by nCoV and still recovering. “Moreover, the administration’s decision last year to privatize garbage collection has also proved beneficial, as our staffers have a relatively lesser workload and are available for sanitization and fumigation activities,” he said.Pune Municipal Corporation offered a similar explanation — its solid waste management department claimed garbage generation dropped by around 20% since the shutdown orders. PMC data show that on an average, the city generates around 2,000 to 2,200 tonnes of garbage daily. It has since come down to 1,700 tonnes per day.Further, PMC officials said waste generation, which often sees a roughly 10% rise in the festive season, was on the downward trend this year, “Waste generation goes up by at least 200 tonnes during the festive season.

139,['30/08/2020'],Kerala wants Centre to take loan and compensate states,"Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A virtual meeting of finance ministers from various states to find a common ground for their reaction to the Centre’s proposals for mobilization of resources to meet the GST revenue gap will be held on Monday.

Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac said on Saturday that the virtual meet was a coordinated attempt by several state governments that were worried about propositions Centre had made recently while discussing the disbursal of GST revenue gap that were due to governments.

“It’s unlikely that there could be a common charter of demands among states. We are exploring whether we can find a common ground in our reaction to the propositions. Individual states would be stating their reactions to the GST council in different ways,” Isaac said. Isaac added that state government would put on record that none of the two proposals, suggested in the GST council, were acceptable to Kerala .

“Centre should borrow the Rs 2.3L crore due to the states as GST compensation and distribute it among states. Centre, if worried about the ill-effects of market borrowing of such a huge amount, should borrow the same from RBI,” he said.

Centre had suggested at Thursday’s meeting that states may source the dues through market borrowings and Centre was willing to increase the borrowing limits by 0.5%. Else, states may take loan to meet the reve. nue short fall due to GST implementation, which was calculated at Rs 97,000 cr. The GST council has given a week’s time for states to intimate their choice.

Isaac said NDA government at the Centre was unnecessarily irritating the government by making impossible propositions. The interest rate could go up from 1-2% when state government tries to borrow. Also, the 0.5% increase in borrowing limits won’t be enough for Kerala and states like Karnataka to source loans that can match the compensation figures.

Isaac said the pandemic alone can’t be blamed for the current economic slump. In September 2019, finance commission chairman had asked all states not to stick to the demand that Centre should continue to give its promised compensation at 14% annual growth rate till 2023.

“The slump had started much earlier, with demonetisation. Compensation was promised to lure states to the GST regime. Centre can’t simply go back from that promise,” Isaac said.

As per rough estimates, GST compensation due to Kerala was around Rs 6,000 crore till July.

FCI office-bearers further claimed neither the gram panchayats nor the MIDC has taken cognisance of the matter. “The condition of internal roads here is pathetic. To make matters worse, household waste is strewn on these roads. Many employees and companies executives have to wade through this garbage,” FCI secretary Dilip Batwal said.

A senior MIDC official said these gram panchayats do not have their own dumping yards. “As a result, they dump their garbage mostly on MIDC land and forest areas in their vicinity at night. We will issue notices to them in the coming days,” the official said.

A team of cops led by Pulivendula SI C Gopinath Reddy was checking vehicles near Raghavendra theatre circle on Friday night when they signalled a car to stop. But the car driver, after initially slowing down, tried to speed away.

The SI immediately jumped in front of the vehicle to stop it, and managed to hold on to the front window and front wind shield as the car kept speeding. After about two kilometres, with the brave cop continuing to cling on to the car’s bonnet and wind shield, the driver stopped the car and fled.

Cops soon reached the spot but by then the two inmates of the car had escaped. Fortunately, Reddy did not suffer any injuries.

Police said the two persons who managed to escape are part of a gang who are wanted in connection with various offences at several police stations in the district. Police said they would be arrested soon.

Vadodara: Three women, whose wards study in Navrachana School in Sama, were acquitted by a local court on Saturday in a case of allegedly assaulting the school staff lodged in March 2018.

Kinnari Kharadi, Purnima Patel and Darshana Joglekar were accused of getting into a scuffle with the staff and behaving improperly over the results of their wards. The school had mentioned ‘passed and eligible for promotion’ in their results. The school had told police that they had made such notes in the results of students whose parents had not paid fees.

“The school has no right to make a note that the students are eligible for promotion,” said the parents’ advocate Kishore Pillai. In other students’ results, the school had mentioned ‘passed and promoted’, he added.

A day after the incident on March 28, 2018, an offence was registered against these parents at Sama police station.

During the trial, the complainant and other witnesses who were staff members of the school gave their testimonies before the court. “There were nine witnesses, but of them around four to five witnesses’ testimonies were contradictory. The prosecution mentioned about CCTV cameras’ footage, but they could never produce any such evidence before the court,” said Pillai. It was also argued that despite the presence of over 500 people at the gate of the school, these three women were targeted as were leaders of the parents’ association.

The court of additional senior civil judge and additional chief judicial magistrate, D J Parmar, upheld Pillai’s arguments for acquitting them. The court also observed that if the school had discussed the issue with the parents peacefully the conflict could have been resolved. “Any institution including the court should give an opportunity to any person to present themselves,” the court stated.

149,['30/08/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Covid-affected lungs turn sample study for doctors,"CHENNAI: One of the most precious possessions surgeons at the MGH Healthcare are now holding is a damaged pair of lungs harvested from a patient who suffered severe respiratory failure following Covid-19 On Friday, a team of transplant surgeons removed the affected lungs of a 48-year-old businessman from Ghaziabad, and gave him a fresh pair, harvested from a brain dead patient at another hospital in the city. This is the first known lung transplant in the country for Covid-19, doctors say.“Until now, we have seen the effect on the virus through X-ray and CT scans. When we saw the lung, we realised how much the novel virus can invade it,” said hospital’s transplant pulmonologist Dr Apar Jindal. “A lung is spongy. The one we removed was as hard as a liver. It was badly inflamed and was plastered to the chest wall,” he said. “We are examining the diseased organ under an electron microscope. We will be doing a pathological study to learn the extent of lung damage,” he said.The eight-hour transplant that ended at 7am on Friday was the only chance of survival for the patient. On Saturday, the patient was stable, on low ventilator support and doctors were planning to wean him of life support in a day or two.Minutes after they replaced his lung, doctors removed the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) he was connected to for more than a month. The recovery, however, may take a long time. “His new lungs are healthy. He is awake and met his family members,” said Dr Suresh Rao, co-director, institute of heart and lung transplant and mechanical circulatory support.The patient was tested positive for Covid-19 on June 8. He was admitted to a hospital in Delhi when his condition was critical. On June 20, doctors there put him on a ventilator. A month later, he was airlifted and brought to the city hospital. On July 25, a day after he was put on the waitlist for lung transplant, doctors connected him on to a veno-venous ECMO to support lung function. “He remained critical but stable,” Dr Rao said.On Thursday, the hospital received a call from the state transplant authority about donor, a 34-year-old man, declared brain dead by doctors at the Gleneagles Global Hospital, following intracerebral haemorrhage on Wednesday. “Transplant post Covid was not an easy decision. But the patient was healthy and young. If we could reverse the lung damage, we knew he had a good chance,” said senior transplant surgeon Dr K R Balakrishnan.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77830377,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-433137,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-affected-lungs-turn-sample-study-for-docs/articleshow/77827673.cms
150,['30/08/2020'],Minister’s export claim fails to enthuse artisans,"Kolhapur: Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal ’s statement about the export potential of the Kolhapuri chappal and its promotion through sales in the international market have been taken with a pinch of salt by the manufactures in the city.

Goyal had said during a virtual meeting with state industries minister on Friday that the iconic leather chappal has an export potential of around Rs 7,500 crore and that its sales can be promoted through five-star hotels across the world.

According to government data, Kolhapuri chappals and similar footwear worth Rs 7.31 crore were exported in 2013-14 while the exports dropped to Rs 1.74 crore in 2019-20, although it was Rs 16.76 crore in 2018-2019.

Anurag Kokitkar, a young entrepreneur from the city who started the ‘Paytaan’ brand and exports the footwear abroad, said, “The artisans have not upgraded themselves to make their product export worthy. There are no organised efforts to produce export quality footwear. The standards in each country for importing leather goods is different.”

Kokitkar said the artisans are trying to adopt standard practices to ensure that the product is of better quality.

Abhijeet Satpute, who along with his family is involved in making Kolhapur chappals for generations, said the industry is battling various issues, including shortage of leather.

“We have a local market for the footwear and do not export it. Tourists are our main customers. However, the Covid related lockdown has hit the tourist inflow our businesses have been shut,” he said

Satputpe, who makes the footwear at home, added that the manufacturers are facing a shortage of leather, forcing them to get it from Chennai-based suppliers, but the quality is poor.

Last year, the Kolhapuri chappal received the GI tag. However, the move did not go down well with the local artisans as the GI taf is for footwear produced in eight districts, including Kolhapur.

The artisans in Kolhapur have sent a petition to the central authorities seeking the GI tag exclusively for Kolhapur city to preserve its quality and avoid duplication.

A decade-and-a-half ago, the leather was tanned locally but due to environmental concerns, the artisans were forced to shut the tanneries. The ban on cattle slaughter has made it more difficult for the local artisans to get good quality leather.

A number of artisans in Kolhapur city regret the mistake of shunning old practices like using vegetable reagents for tanning to save costs. The use of chemicals has been a major concern for environmental hazard, mainly the pollution of the Panchganga river.

Block medical officers under supervision of chief medical officers (CMOs) will be responsible for such testing while at peripheral health institutions such testing will be undertaken at institutions having ELISA Reader.A circular has been issued for testing symptomatic health workers and SARI (severe respiratory illness) patients admitted in private and public hospitals of state.To augment the testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Himachal Pradesh , the state has issued advisories for antigen-based assays according to the recommendations of the ICMR for the industrial establishments, private hospitals and laboratories. ICMR has recommended the use of rapid antigen test for detection of Covid-19 and IgG ELISA test for sero-surveillance in various settings.Dhiman said that Himachal Pradesh is soon providing the antigen-based Assays kit and IgG ELISA kits for use across state in various public health facilities and for containment of Covid-19.According to the guidelines for antigen test, it will be conducted on asymptomatic cases or in containment zones; institutional quarantine facilities where the inter-state travellers from high-load cities have completed 6-7 days quarantine; asymptomatic patients who are hospitalized or seeking hospitalization in the high risk groups of chemotherapy, HIV positive, malignant disease, transplant.

“The area is generally unstable due to the geological setting of saprolitic sheet joints dipping towards the valley. Extensive power blasting has broken the rocks and opened the sheet joints further sloping towards the valley. During rainy season excess rainwater percolated through the sheet joints triggering massive plane failures. The remnants of overhanging bodies slid down due to rock blasting,” the report, submitted to the Idukki district collector, stated. It recommended that “all the remaining overhanging rocks above the road level and displaced huge blocks below the road, towards the valley should be removed with caution. The large place bedrock that was cut off from the hill and slid down to the road surface edge has to be removed carefully. The portion overhanging the valley has to be removed in small places first through minor blasting or chemical blasting. The RC retaining wall on the hillside has to be founded firmly on the 15m thick grouting. There should be sufficient opening for the surface water to join the concrete drain.”

It was on June 17 that a major landslide occurred on the stretch that swept away nearly 200m of road. Another major landslide on August 7 . Within a year nearly 20 landslides were reported on the stretch.

Prakash, a resident of Bisonvalley, said, “ The area is under serious landslide threat and farmers have informed officials that they don’t need compensation. They want the government to buy the land from them as it has been rendered uncultivable.”

“We will resume road-widening work on the Gap Road stretch only after a meeting of farmers of the region,” Idukki collector H Dineshan told TOI.

Devikulam sub-collector S Premkrishnan said, “The future of Gap Road has been called into question. The road-widening work is a risk which was unnecessary and is best avoided.”

KOCHI: Concerns have been raised over the lapses in contact tracing at several hospitals in the city, especially private ones, after their employees test positive for Covid-19. Sources said the failure of the hospitals to quarantine primary contacts of staff who test positive for the virus has resulted in a spike in the number of cases reported from such hospitals.

""On Friday, we conducted a virtual meeting with representatives of private hospitals after lapses in contact tracing and other Covid-19 control measures were brought to our notice. We have asked them to give data on the number of cases and also to take measures to prevent disease spread among their staff and other patients,"" Dr N K Kuttappan, DMO, said.

As many as 24 cases were reported from a private hospital in Kochi on Friday, according to health department.

In the month of August alone, nearly 150 cases were reported from the private hospitals in the district. Still, during several instances, authorities have not been keen to send the primary contacts of these patients to quarantine, said sources. ""In our hospital, several employees tested positive for Covid-19 in the past one month. But those who came into contact with them were rarely quarantined,"" said a doctor with a private hospital.

""Of the 24 cases reported the other day from the private hospital, most are canteen staff. Still, the canteen remains operational. It was not closed for even a single day for disinfection. They brought staff from their charity organization in Kollam and replaced those who tested positive for Covid-19,"" says one of the hospital staff. No efforts were taken to trace those who came into contact with the canteen staff, including doctors, nurses, other patients and visitors, the employee added.

At the same time, in another hospital, a group of nursing staff were sent to quarantine after a patient with whom they came into contact turned positive. ""The patient had undergone a surgical procedure. But none of the doctors who had also come into contact with the patient were told to go into quarantine. These doctors end up as disease carriers,"" a nursing staff of the hospital said.

Officials with the health department in the district said they have given instructions to private hospitals managements on the need for conducting contact tracing. ""We provide the details of the primary contacts to the health department. We also quarantine all the persons identified by the department,"" said Dr Thomas Paul, district president, Kerala Private Hospitals Managements Association.

Karwar: A new research has shown the presence of Kalinga cricket frogs (KCF or Fejervarya kalinga) in the Western Ghats , indicating Morphological Phenotypic Plasticity (MPP).

The research is a joint effort of researchers Amit Hegde of Sirsi, prof Girish Kadadevaru of Breeding Behaviour and Bioacoustics Lab of the zoology department of Karnatak University, and K P Dinesh of Zoological Survey of India (Pune). Their research findings have been published in the recent edition of ‘Zootaxa’, a journal of international repute.

MPP is the ability of an organism to show drastic morphological variations in response to natural environmental variations or stimuli, according to the team of researchers. In 2018, KCF was described and reported from the Eastern Ghats and also thought to be endemic to the hill ranges there.

The team has reported KCF from the central Western Ghats with considerable evidence of MPP. Hegde said: “During my field expeditions in the Western Ghats, I have encountered this species several times — it looks completely different from Fejervaraya/ Minervarya specie known in the Western Ghats. In the era of climate change, we are still discovering new species and we don’t know a lot about the species and within how they behave or adapt themselves to different biogeography ranges,” he said.

Kadadevaru said though there is a decline in the amphibian population globally, researchers in India are successfully able to explore new species and trace the geographic ranges of some rare amphibians.

“In the present study too, there is a report of the frog species, that was thought to be endemic to a few parts in the Eastern Ghats, being located in the central Eastern Ghats. However, the frog from the Eastern Ghats is phenotypically showing certain differences when compared with the population that was observed in the Eastern Ghats,” he said.

Dinesh said that only morphological character utility in the identification of the species and addressing the taxonomic uncertainties is tricky. “But the utility of genetic data and DNA bar-coding tools are handy in resolving complex taxonomic problems,” he added.

It had consulted with top Russian firms to create and deploy immersive, dreamy situations in live shows to enthrall new audiences using lighting and imagine techniques.And then came the Covid-19 pandemic.“We had planned to do shows that would significantly upgrade the very experience of a circus for families and children. The equipment, the plans, and all the techniques were ready, including new forms of lighting, 3D projection, and others, while keeping the circus acts that are well-known. But then the pandemic came about, and we had to cancel a lot of shows,” Sujith Dilip, proprietor of Rambo Circus, told TOI.But, to bring circuses back to life, and for the welfare of the performers who have been significantly damaged financially, Sujith has partnered with a ticket aggregator and its corporate social responsibility (CSR) arm, an entertainment studio, and a non governmental organisation (NGO).The circus is going online from September 25 to October 6, titled Life Is A Circus, but the content, according to Sujith, is more than just circus acts and accompanying music and lights.A narrator will lead the show which will be livestreamed, taking viewers through the history of Rambo Circus, and all that it has achieved through the years, including some of its most famous acts, some of which have been choreographed and recorded at a circus tent adjusted as a studio.All through, the circus performers- 60 of them- will take the audiences through the struggles of the performers through the years, and the finale, consisting of live acts like the trapeze, stilt walking, clown shows with unicycles, will be a tribute to people on the frontline against the pandemic.“We were stuck at our base in Airoli when the pandemic happened, and no performances could happen. The entertainment studio approached us about taking the circus online, as something new and interesting. We recreated our circus tent in the form of a studio with cameras and lights, and there has been extensive practice and recording of choreographed sequences. This has been going on for more than a month. And we named the show thus to reflect the people who are involved in the circus, including our performers, who have been with us for many years now,” Sujith said.The tickets for the livestreamed event has been placed in three brackets, with the highest bracket guaranteeing the viewer an exclusive interaction with the performers themselves. People will also be able to donate to the welfare of the performers, even if they are not ticketed viewers, through the NGO partner of the event.Sujith is almost of circus royalty- his father, PT Dilip, founded the circus in 1992, merging three smaller circuses. He has certainly seen better days in the circus industry, when children and animals were allowed to perform, and audiences would be teeming in the tent.He added that though he was lucky to receive funds from the government for the welfare of his circus performers, others have not had the rub of the green.But he disagrees that the pandemic may turn out to be the coup de grace for circuses itself.“There are smaller circuses in small towns and cities who could not sustain themselves in this situation. Rambo Circus even pooled some funds from various sources to help out some of the performers of these circuses. The government should be allowing theatres and shows to resume at probably half the capacity by the end of the year. But I think that many of the circuses would be forced to pack up for good by the time it happens. Then again, I also don’t think that people like circuses any more. We would still want to launch our upgrade of the circus once public events can resume,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77832566,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-401173,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-19-forces-rambo-circus-to-fold-its-tent-but-online-shows-may-rescue-it/articleshow/77827681.cms

With a good number of non-resident Keralities, who returned from other states and countries opting for paid quarantine, hotels started housing these guests adhering to protocols set by the Centre and state governments. This Onam, hotels are serving packed sadhya to their guests in quarantine.

According to data released by the district administration, more than 2,000 people in Ernakulam district have opted for paid quarantine.

A luxury hotel at Willindon Island stated that they would provide quarantine facility as well as serve sadhya to their guests. “However, this will be packed and delivered at their rooms. The guest opting for quarantine will have to remain at the hotel for a minimum of seven nights,” said an employee with the hotel.

Jose Pradeep, state executive committee member of Federation of Kerala Hotels Association said that during the initial stages, “paid quarantine did bring good business to the hotels. However, its success will depend on the availability of staff. It is not possible for all hotels to retain too many employees during the crisis”.

Riaz Ahmad of Abad Hotels and Resorts said that two-three months ago paid quarantine helped in sustaining business. As government has allowed people to opt for home quarantine the business is slowly losing its sheen. “However, customers are returning to restaurants. Both hotels and resorts are using disposable utensils and bed linen and follow all Covid protocols,” he said.

He also said this year not many hotels are interested in hosting Onam celebrations. Pradeep, who runs hotel Yuvarani said there are no special plans for Onam. “It is mainly due to uncertainty of customer patronage and heavy maintenance cost. Unless the bar starts functioning, there will be no profit,” he said.

Meanwhile, luxury hotels in the city are offering ‘Onasadhya’ as takeaway and dine-in. Grand Hyatt provides takeaway for small and large groups. Moreover, they are also offering eight varieties of payasam, delivered at the customers’ doorstep by online food delivery service providers. On Thiruvonam day, sadhya will be served at the hotel.

163,['30/08/2020'],Chennai: CMRL to construct 12-storey office and retail space,"Almost all 32 stations have space to be rented out for retail outlets

CHENNAI: In less than two years, city residents could get to their workplace or shop and grab a bite before they hop onto a metro train as the Chennai Metro Rail ( CMRL ) will soon commence construction of a 12-storey office complex at Ekkatuthangal.

Metro rail has floated tenders to begin construction of the complex which, upon completion, is expected to generate additional revenue. According to the tender invite, the office building or complex will have 11 floors with ground floor and two basement levels and the construction, which will also include mechanical, electrical and plumbing work, is expected to be completed in 18 months.

CMRL officials had r said the building at Ekkatuthangal would come up in a 40,558sqft area. They would be ready-to-occupy warm shells, with space for office and retail outlets. The building would be linked to the nearest metro station through pathways. A metro official had said, “The lower levels will be for retail and the upper levels will be office space.” The official said similar buildings were planned in a 17,868sqft space in Arumbakkam and a few other stations like Nehru Park and Ashok Nagar.

In 2019, much before start of the construction of the building, CMRL floated a tender to licence out the space in the office building planned at Ekattuthangal and Nehru Park. This, they said, was done to gauge market interest and response in using such spaces on rental basis before CMRL could invest in the construction. The effort to study market response by floating the tender was done as many such spaces available in the metro stations still have no takers. “The tender is for prospective occupants and concessionaires, who would use these proposed buildings or take over the entire development and operate it,” an official had said. The plan was to licence the space out for a period of 12 years.

Almost all 32 stations have space to be rented out for retail outlets. But except for a few stalls in the street level of stations like Nehru Park and Koyambedu, many of them built inside bigger stations like Shenoy Nagar, which has been operational for more than three years, are lying vacant.

164,['30/08/2020'],Ahmedabad: TikTok torment of ex-friend drives woman to suicide,"Representative image

AHMEDABAD: A complaint was filed in Ahmedabad on Friday over the suicide of a married Khanpur woman , apparently triggered by the cyber onslaught of a former friend who was incensed that she had married another man.

The victim is Rachnakumari Ronaksinh , the wife of an inspector in the office of the deputy commissioner of the GST department in the city. Rachnakumari killed herself at her rented house in Khanpur on June 29.

The complaint was lodged at Shahpur police station on Friday by her father Arunkumar Rajput of Patna. According to Rajput’s complaint, Rachnakumari’s tormentor was Kanhaiyakumar Rajput of Fatehpur.

The filing of the complaint was delayed because Arunkumar Rajput was unable to travel due to the lockdown.

According to the complaint, after Rachnakumari married, Kanhaiyakumar started phoning her husband, identified only as Ronaksinh. Kanhaiyakumar kept up the harassment by also sending voice messages to Ronaksinh.

On June 28, Kanhaiyakumar sent a TikTok video featuring him and Rachnakumari to Ronaksinh. That pushed her over the edge, the complaint said.

“When Rachnakumari learnt of the video, she was distraught and said Kanhaiyakumar had ruined her life,” said a police official. “On June 29, she killed herself.”

The complaint said that before her marriage, Rachnakumari and Kanhaiyakumar were residents of the same Bihar village and had become friends. The complaint said her marriage to Ronaksinh enraged Kanhaiyakumar.

Soon, Kanhaiyakumar started the harassment over the phone. The complaint said that Kanhaiyakumar responded with abuses to the couple’s pleas to see reason.

“According to the complaint, one day Kanhaiyakumar called Rachnakumari and told her that if she let him film one TikTok video with him, he would never contact her again,” the police official said. “In the hope that the torture would end, Rachnakumari agreed. Kanhaiyakumar came to her house in Khanpur, shot the video, and went away.” Then came the betrayal.

Inspector R K Amin of the Shahpur police station said: “We sent a team to Bihar after the she killed herself. Her father said he wanted to lodge an FIR against Kanhaiyakumar after the lockdown.”

165,['30/08/2020'],Woman accused of extorting Rs 1 lakh,"Ahmedabad: A 29-year-old man from Lapkaman village in the outskirts of the city lodged a complaint with Bopal police on Friday against a 25-year-old woman that she allegedly extorted Rs 1 lakh from him after their consensual physical relationship. He was preparing for his UPSC exams in Delhi when he was allegedly trapped by the woman, originally from Akola in Maharashtra.

The man stated in the complaint that she threatened him that if he didn’t pay him money she would lodge a complaint of rape against him. The man alleged that the woman has lodged complaints of rape and molestation in Akola against several people.

Bopal police have lodged a complaint under sections 420, 384, 389, and 506(2) and have informed their counterparts in Delhi and Maharashtra to search for the woman.

The complainant’s family belongs to Jharkhand and for the past 20 years they have been living in Ahmedabad. “In 2016, he went to Delhi and joined an institute in Karol Bagh for the UPSC exams preparation. In June-July 2019, while he was staying as paying guest in Delhi he got a call from the woman,” said a police official.

According to the FIR, when the woman learnt that the complainant was staying alone as a paying guest and preparing for the UPSC exams, she requested the complainant to find a rented house for her as she also wanted to prepare for the UPSC exams.

The girl and her mother came to stay in Delhi near his house as he arranged one for them. “They became friends and later physical intimacy developed between the two,” said the police official.

According to the complainant, the woman later started blackmailing him and extorted Rs 1 lakh between March 2020 and May 2020. “As the woman continued to threaten him to lodge a complaint of rape, the youth left his UPSC studies and came back to Ahmedabad. But the accused kept on calling him and his family members and threatened to fix the youth in a false case of rape,” the official said.

167,['30/08/2020'],Kerala: Florists’ hopes wilt this Onam season,"KOCHI: The unorganized flower business sector is reeling under crisis for the third consecutive year with business taking a huge hit due to the pandemic. Wholesalers and retailers whose business is centred around Ernakulam say that the government warning against buying of flowers fearing Covid spread has dealt a major blow to the sector.Though the state lifted the ban on flowers from neighbouring states, especially Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, florists have no reason to heave a sigh of relief. Florists in the city say that with the government banning pookkalam (floral carpet) in government offices, even the little business that could have come by is gone.“As it is, none of the offices are having Onam celebrations. Colleges and schools are closed, residents associations or communities are also not putting any pookkalam in front of their buildings. Everybody is managing with the flowers available at home,” said Rajesh M R, Flower Palace, Tripunithura.He said that though they expected poor business and planned orders accordingly, it has been even poor. “People used to buy 2-3 kg of flowers for their homes every couple of days from Atham onwards and as we near Uthradam, the quantity increase. Also, offices generally have their Onam celebrations closer to holidays. So around these days, people would buy flowers for Rs 2,000-3,000. Now people buy a Rs 50 packet which has around five types of flowers, including marigold in 3 colours, arali (Neriam oleander), jemanthi (chrysanthemum) and vadamalli (globe amaranth).It’s not just the sale of Onam flowers that has been affected. Even temple flowers are not having takers. Shops have cut-down on their part-time workers because of poor business. “But we have to take care of them because they have been associated with us for several years. The government managed this whole business very poorly. Instead of just announcing that flowers could carry coronavirus, state should have given us instructions to follow and ensured that business is conducted following Covid protocol,” said, Regi George, Pushpavady Flowers and Decorations.“People come to our shop and enquire whether the flowers are from Tamil Nadu. Customers are reluctant to buy flowers from other states. Government offices were told not to use flowers from other states. The announcement of relaxation came late. There are a lot of uncertainties. We don’t know if there would be business. In the past 3-4 years, some hurdle or the other has turned up. People are stopping floriculture business. Being an unorganized sector, lots of people are unemployed,” he added.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77827689,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-86962,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/florists-hopes-wilt-this-onam-season/articleshow/77827690.cms

The programme has been a great success by teaching hundreds of elderly people information technology, spoken English, Communicative French, Hindi, etc. with the help of undergraduate students.

But as the pandemic has derailed the club’s activities by putting restrictions on elderly people and the college, the organizers are now relying on online platforms to resume the classes.

Online classes for 2020-21 were officially inaugurated by M G Rajamanickam, director of fisheries and incident director of Covid containment zones, through an online conference on Sunday.

Just like the offline classes, a one-to-one learning system is taking place in every online classroom as there will be an age-friendly volunteer to teach every student with the help of a main teacher mentoring them throughout the course. There are 109 elderly students, including retired government employees.

“Due to the current pandemic scenario, classes could not be taken in an offline mode. Hence, classes have been shifted to the online medium. Being entirely new to this platform, the first few classes were to make the students familiarize with the new platform of learning. Recorded classes on how to operate Google Meet and other related online applications were made accessible to students,” said Abin Ambily, faculty coordinator of the club.

The club is aimed at giving them exposure to the real college atmosphere and providing them with all the activities of the college. Moreover, it aims at an inter-generational interaction in the present days where most students come from a nuclear family with no grandparents. Also, it will help the elderly to be engaged.

In addition, various other activities and programmes of the club have also been transformed to the new platform.

On August 15, ‘Tiranga’, the Independence Day celebration by the elderly people was conducted through the Google Meet.

Apartment associations point out that with employees being given the opportunity to work from home, many residents have left for their native places and there are others who plan to leave as holidays begin.

The All Kerala Apartment Owners Association president V K Shankarankutty said that there will not be any gathering at apartment complexes . “All apartments have been asked to adhere to Covid-19 protocols. We are not hosting any events. This year residents are confined to their individual apartments.”

Usually apartment owners’ associations host programmes like Onam feast and cultural events. “This year there is no such activity. In previous years, many associations conducted cooking competitions, floral carpet competitions and the like,” he said.

Representatives of apartment associations say that residents are not keen on celebrating the festival. The increasing number of Covid positive cases and people being quarantined in flats have taken away the sheen of the festival.

“Generally, apartment associations host celebrations either before the festival season or afterwards to ensure maximum participation. It is because people go to their ancestral homes or opt to spend their vacation at some other place. This year, since people are given the option to work from home many have already left the city. Those who remain here due to work commitments will leave as holidays begin,” said Rajeena Yusaf, a resident of an apartment complex at Jawahar Nagar.

Vasco now has half of Margao’s active positive cases. Active positive cases are also on the rise in Ponda with 266 cases. New cases in Porvorim are approaching the 200 mark with cases in Panaji and Mapusa also inching towards the double century mark.

Chief officer of Mapusa Municipal Council Kabir Shirgaonkar said that seven members of a municipal worker’s family tested positive after Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations. “There has been a spike in cases possibly due to festivities,” he said.

After more than a dozen fish vendors tested positive, the Mapusa municipal market continues to remain closed. Authorities are yet to take a call on when to open it. “A decision will be taken after holding a meeting,” Shirgaonkar added.

“Don’t have interactions for more than 15 minutes. Ensure that social distancing is maintained and that the space is well ventilated, all this while wearing masks. There shouldn’t be crowding,” a health worker said. He also advised against people sharing the same vehicle to work where several cases have been reported of persons testing positive.

“One of them turns positive and the rest get all stressed out. They then have to wait for five days to get tested because if they get tested on the first day there’s no point as it will be a false negative,” the health worker said.

“Celebrating festivals during this time are not recommended but cannot be avoided. There will be consequences of not maintaining social distancing,” the health worker added.

GAYA: Suspected Maoists gunned down two people at Harni Khajura village under the Magra police station area in Gaya district late on Friday night. One villager was injured in the attack. The victims were identified as Mahindra Yadav and Ram Dayal Rajak.

The Maoists left a handwritten note in the village, alleging that Mahindra was a police informer and land broker. Gaya SSP Rajiv Mishra said the Maoists were armed with sophisticated weapons, including AK-47 rifle.

According to the SSP, preliminary investigations revealed that as the Maoist base weakened in the region on account of increased police mobility and execution of development projects, several land owners, whose land was earlier grabbed by the Maoists, were reclaiming the land for cultivation and sale purposes.

“Mahindra was helping the villagers in their effort to reclaim lost land. This infuriated the Maoists,” he added.

The SSP said the Maoists targeted only Mahindra and the other person got killed accidentally. “Ten people were named in the FIR registered in connection with the incident and three of them have been arrested. Efforts are on to arrest the remaining accused,” the SSP added.

Meanwhile, irate villagers blocked road traffic in the area to register protest against the killing of the villagers. The roadblock was lifted after Sherghati SDO Upendra Pandit assured the villagers of providing financial assistance to the dependants of the murdered villagers.

PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Saturday visited the bank of the Ganga near Hathidah in Patna district and inspected the ongoing construction work in the first phase of the Ganga Water Lift Scheme (GWLS) of the water resources department (WRD). The scheme is aimed at supplying clean drinking water to Gaya, Bodh Gaya and Rajgir towns.

The scheme is part of the CM’s ‘Jal-Jivan-Hariyali’ campaign to minimise the bad effects of climate change. The first phase of the GWLS is estimated to cost around Rs 2,836 crore and it is targeted to be completed by June next year.

During the inspection, the CM asked the WRD officials and site engineers to ensure completion of the first phase within the deadline.

“In the first phase of the GWLS, pipelines will be laid. Dedicated reservoirs and water treatment plants will also be constructed for supplying 43 million cubic meter (MCM) and 7 MCM clean drinking water to Gaya and Rajgir towns, respectively,” a WRD official told TOI on Saturday. In the second phase of the project, clean drinking water will be supplied to Nawada town.

Accompanied by the water resources department (WRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha and information and public relations department (IPRD) minister Neeraj Kumar, the CM first visited the construction site of the Ganga river intake source at Hathidah and enquired about technical specialties of the project and progress of the works from the site engineers.

The CM also visited the site of the scheme’s intake pump house being constructed on the bank of the Ganga and enquired about the progress of work.

WRD secretary Sanjiv Hans gave detailed information about the first phase of the GWLS to the CM on the basis of the scheme’s schematic diagram. The CM also enquired about the route of pipeline up to Rajgir and from Rajgir to Gaya and issued necessary instructions to the engineers for completing the scheme at the stipulated time.

After spot inspection at Hathidah, the CM undertook an aerial survey of the scheme’s pipeline route up to Rajgir and Gaya. He also undertook an aerial survey of the project’s two main reservoirs at Rajgir and Manpur (Gaya) where lifted waters from the Ganga will be stored for supply to the nearest townships.

The CM also enquired about the progress of work in the six-lane road bridge over the Ganga river, which is being built parallel to the existing two-lane Rajendra Setu over the same river near Mokama.

179,['30/08/2020'],"Truck jumps signal, mows down youth, injures 6 others","Police remove the truck involved in the accident at Cheranellore Signal Junction along the Container Road on S... Read More

Kochi: In a freak accident, a truck jumping a signal led to the death of a youth at Cheranellore Signal Junction along Container Road after the truck rammed into vehicles crossing the signal on Saturday afternoon. Six others sustained injuries and one of them was rushed to a nearby hospital in critical condition.

The deceased has been identified as Amal K M, 26, a resident of North Paravoor. He was riding a motorcycle and crossing the signal when the truck rammed into him at around 2:30pm.

According to police, the truck was going towards the city centre from Kalamassery while the other vehicles were headed towards Edapally from Varapuzha. The two-wheeler and a car had reached the middle of the junction when the speeding truck mowed down the two-wheeler rider. It then hit the car and pushed it forward and hit other vehicles before coming to a stop.

All the injured were rushed to a private hospital at Cheranellore. Though the doctors tried to revive Amal, his life couldn’t be saved. The car driver, Manikandan is in the ICU of the hospital. Hospital sources said that he was on ventilator support.

Cheranalloor police registered a case invoking Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC against the truck driver. “The truck was speeding and came to a stop after hitting the car and pushing it forward for a few meters. Other vehicles on the lane too were hit, leaving people injured,” said a police officer.

Police said that the truck driver too sustained injuries in the collision. Traffic was disrupted for a brief while due to the accident.

Road safety expert P D Sunil Babu said that the primary fault in all accidents caused by signal jumping should be attributed to human error. “It seems the truck driver was in a hurry to unload his goods ahead of the festival season. Such haste at signals is asking for trouble, as the lights are set up there mainly to alert the commuters of the need for being cautious,” said Babu.

On highways, one needs to be extra cautious while gauging traffic, he added. “There are many lanes converging at a signal junction and a vehicle can come speeding from any direction. Commuters have to slow down, understand the signal and then proceed,” said Babu.

180,['30/08/2020'],Bull run on Friday night keeps Jamnagar road on weekend high,"Around 250 bulls escaped from the facility after some miscreants broke the lock deliberately

Rajkot: This wasn’t surely a copy of ‘Pamplona Running of Bulls’, but Jamnagar’s own bizarre version of the traditional Spanish summer festival, when a huge herd of mean-looking bulls came charging down the town’s street at around 8:30pm on Friday.

While in the centuries-old tradition, six to 10 cattle are let loose on a subset of a town’s streets for fun, the mayhem on Dadiya and neighbouring villages’ narrow roads as a result of nearly 250 adult bulls on the loose was anything but a nightmare. The rampaging animals were from a pen on the outskirts of the Jamnagar city on Samana highway.

According to the police, some miscreants broke into the animal hostel of Jamnagar Municipal Corporation (JMC) and deliberately released the stray animals captured by its teams from city streets. The security guard of the pen registered an FIR with Panchkoshi B division police station on Saturday.

In his plaint, security guard Bhikhu Tambolia said that around six persons arrived there in a car at around 8pm on Friday and demanded him to open the gate. When he refused, the accused hurled abuses at him and also beat him up. Tambolia called one Ramesh Kaneja who lives nearby and works in the same hostel, but by the time he arrived, the accused already broke into the hostel and released all the animals.

Tambolia further alleged that one of the accused told him, “You don’t give the animals fodder and send them to the slaughterhouse. So we want to release these animals. My name is Ravirajsinh Jadeja and do whatever you can do”, before leaving the place. The guard, however, managed to get the number of the car.

Jamnagar municipal commissioner, Satish Patel told TOI, “We have registered an FIR and hope they get arrested soon. They weren’t cattle breeders but anti-social elements. This hostel was exclusively for bulls and nobody has ownership over bulls.”

Patel also said that teams have already been dispatched to nearby villages to recapture the animals. Fortunately, it happened at night and there were very few people on the roads and so no major mishap took place from the incident, he added.

The accused are booked under various sections of IPC and prevention of damage to public property Act 1984.

181,['30/08/2020'],Amdavadis cycling like never before,"Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad-based ophthalmologist, Dr Manish Raval, took to cycling very keenly during the pandemic as there was no other way to keep himself fit. “Jogging and cycling were the only options for outdoor workouts and thus, I was looking to upgrade my bicycle to a high-end one. Despite having placed the order since a month and a half, the cycle hasn’t yet arrived yet,” he said.

There are many like Dr Raval, who have pre-booked their bicycles with dealers and are awaiting deliveries. With gyms and outdoor sports complexes closed during the lockdown following the Covid-19 pandemic and workspaces shifting to homes, many are embracing cycling as a means to keep themselves fit. While the city already had a cycling culture with actively operational cycling clubs in addition to independent government and privately-organized initiatives to encourage cycling, the demand for bicycles never saw such a surge as during the pandemic.

Dealers of bicycles revealed that the demand for cycles has gone up at least two-folds as compared to last year in July and August. However, the inventories of most dealers have dried up.

Sachin Wadhwani, owner, Laxmi Cycles – an Ahmedabad-based dealer of cycles — said, “From June to August, our sales are 2.5 times against the same period last year. With gyms, fitness centres, and playing arenas remaining closed for a long time, even after the lockdown was lifted, there was hardly any alternative for workout and as it turns out, cycling is a preferred alternative for people.”

“Amid increased demand, we are out of stock for cycles. After the pandemic, manufacturers cancelled past orders while fresh orders will take two-three months to arrive. If a customer approaches us, we ask them to wait for at least a month,” Wadhwani added.

Echoing a similar view, Kirpalsinh Chauhan , owner, The Cycle Shop – another city-based dealership, said, “We used to sell an average of 60 cycles in a month during this time last year. However, the same has now grown to an average of 150 per month in July-August this year. The demand is good but supply-side constraints are also triggered at manufacturer-level due to labourer shortage.”

Dealers revealed that cycles priced from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000 are in maximum demand and are currently unavailable in the market. While imported cycles take time to arrive, many of those by Indian companies too are contract manufactured outside India and thus are taking time to be delivered, revealed industry players.

In fact, the demand for bicycles is so good that online platforms offering bicycles on rentals too are facing an inventory shortage, struggling to meet the growing demand.

“The increase in demand is overwhelming. We had placed an order for some 2,000 bicycles in July and we are yet to receive the delivery from our suppliers. They could commit to a supply of a maximum of 150 units in a week,” said Arjit Soni, founder, MyByk.

“People hire cycles mainly for fitness and leisure purposes. We are yet to see demand growing from commuters but a proper infrastructure with dedicated lanes for cyclists is imperative to fuel this,” Soni further added.

KOCHI: Work on the construction of the rail overbridge (ROB) at Atlantis is expected to begin within six months.

Roads and Bridges Development Corporation (RBDCK) managing director Rahul R Pillai said that a work order has been issued for installing boundary stone for the project.

Kerala infrastructure investment fund board (KIIFB) has sanctioned Rs 89.774 crore for executing the project. The overbridge has a length of 523.92m, including the approach roads.

“People whose land would be acquired need to be rehabilitated. It was expected that the land acquisition and rehabilitation process would be completed without much delay,” said Pillai.

The RBDCK is entrusted with the execution of the project. Ernakulam MLA T J Vinod said land acquisition process was progressing and the revenue department has to issue a notification for land acquisition and take over.

Councillor David Parambithara said approximately four hectares of land need to be acquired. While some buildings need to be demolished fully, others would be partially demolished.

“The aim was to build the ROB by keeping the disruption at minimum. There were also some encroachments along the alignment of the ROB. It seems these people were also included in the rehabilitation package, which would be provided as part of the land acquisition process,” he said.

The construction of the Atlantis ROB will open a new connectivity between MG Road and Panampilly Nagar. It will help to decongest the stretch between Atlantis Junction and Pallimukku on MG Road and between Pallimukku and Manorama Junction, the councillor added.

However, it was pointed out that the lockdown and severe financial crisis faced by the state government could have an adverse impact on the land acquisition process.

“The upcoming local body polls and financial crisis could further delay the project execution. The rehabilitation package would have to be announced and handed over to those who give up their land. As the ROB passes through one of the prime locations in the city, the land value would be high. The revenue department was focused on tackling the pandemic. All these could have an impact on the speed of the project execution,” said an official with the district administration.

“Freedom of expression is under threat. They want people of India — farmers, tribals, women, youth and businessmen — to keep their mouth shut. They want to silence the voice of people,” she said during a video-conference for the Bhoomi Pujan of a new assembly complex in Chhattisgarh’s Naya Raipur . “Autocracy is gaining ground over democracy,” the AICC chief said.

“None of our forefathers would have foreseen that the country would face such a difficult situation 75 years after independence,” Sonia said, adding: “Attempts are being made to derail the nation and it’s a new challenge before our Constitution. Attempts are being made to divide the nation by pitting people against each other in a ‘divide and rule’ policy, and wrong feelings and sentiments are over-shadowing everything else.”

She has launched repeated attacks on the BJP-led Union government in the past few days for holding back states’ GST dues and insisting on holding NEET and JEE during the Covid pandemic .

“During the last seven decades, we have come a long way, faced many challenges successfully and found solutions to many problems. However, we are still away from fulfilling many dreams,” Sonia said.

People are India’s hope, she said. “Parliament and legislative assemblies are the pillars and temples of our democracy. But we have to remember that our Constitution is preserved and protected not just by such buildings and infrastructure but by the sentiments of people,” the Congress chief remarked.

187,['30/08/2020'],"Pivot and win: New mantra for entrepreneurs, startups","AHMEDABAD: Rahul Panch, a solar power engineer and adventure aficionado, decided to make his passion his profession when he launched Chal Kabira, a startup that offered ‘graduation trip’ experience to students of IIMs and IITs across the country. Over 2,000 students and professionals became part of trips organized by him in a few years.

“In 2020, due to Covid-19 we have not been able to organize a single trip,” says Panch, whose venture is incubated with Gujarat University Startup and Entrepreneurship Council (GUSEC). Panch is now offering ‘working vacations’ in the shadow of Covid-19 for executives.

Rahul Bhagchandani, group CEO of GUSEC, said when a startup changes its product or strategy without losing its core tech, it can be identified as pivoting. “We observe about 15-20% of our startups pivoting in post-Covid-19 scenario,” he said.

UrbanKhet, another startup incubated at GUSEC, was earlier focused on exotic vegetables grown at their own hydroponics-based farm on outskirts of Ahmedabad. “Post Covid-19, we expanded our base to vegetables delivery at doorstep. We collaborated with farmers and stuck to our basic idea of delivering fresh greens,” said Priyam Sameer, founder of the venture.

189,['30/08/2020'],Builders hope stamp duty cut will boost sales,"Nagpur: City builders are elated over the 3% stamp duty cut affected by the state government and are hoping it will boost sale of properties that are complete or nearing completion.

Mahesh Sadhwani, Credai Nagpur president , said that it was a big boost for the realty sector,which was down since the last three to four years. “People have realized the importance of having a big home due to work from home policy. Those having one BHK are going for two BHK, two BHK people are going for three BHK. They are converting one room as office. This is the best time to buy. Rates are stable and stamp duty has been reduced,” he told TOI.

Ashok Chandak of Credai said that about three months ago, Credai had held a webinar with revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and principal secretary (revenue) Nitin Kareer and demonstrated that cut in stamp duty would lead to more revenue for the state government. “Thorat had promised to cut stamp duty and he has fulfilled his promise. The biggest thing is that it is a blanket cut and there is no cut or classification,” he said.

Chandak further said that cut in stamp duty in London had doubled the revenue of the local body. “Same will happen in the state,” he added.

Builder Shravan Kukreja described it as a very big boost for the economy of the state. “The stamp duty is lowest in 20 years. The next three months will be best for buyers in 20 years. However, I feel that the stamp duty of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) houses should have been 1%,” he said.

Realtor TS Renu said that stamp duty was an indirect tax which is mostly to be paid initially, thereby causing an instant burden on home buyers. “With this reduction, home buyers will certainly save considerable amount as an average flat in Nagpur suburbs costs around ₹50 lakh. So with 3% reduction in stamp duty, the buyer will save ₹1.5 lakh which is a huge benifit and saving for the buyers.”

192,['30/08/2020'],Govt approves healthcare facility for Ribandar locals,"Panaji: The directorate of health services (DHS) has given its nod to start a primary health centre for Ribandar at the old GMC complex that formerly housed the Goa Institute of Management.

The non-bedded PHC will be set up using funds from the Smart City Mission and will be renovated by Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Ltd, mayor Uday Madkaikar said.

Health officer at the urban health centre, Dr Neeta Kakodkar, in a letter said that since the complex has not been used for a long time, major repairs are required, including floor tiling and fixing of plumbing and electrical connections.

DHS has also written a letter granting approval for a “day care medical dispensary” where a doctor, a nurse, a pharmacist and an attendant will be stationed.

“For 25 years now, the people of Ribandar have had nothing and their demand for a PHC has long been pending. (Panaji MLA) Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate has decided to take up renovation of the place and give the work to Smart City. By February, we think it should get it ready,” Madkaikar said.

Incidentally, the Panaji civic polls, which were last conducted in March 2016, are likely to be held in February or March, 2021.

“I have spoken to chief minister Pramod Sawant and health minister Vishwajit Rane, and they have allotted space for the health centre,” Monserrate said.

The PHC will benefit locals who currently rely on the Panaji urban health centre or the Chimbel PHC for treatment of small ailments.

The proposed facility will also have a waiting room for patients, room for staff members and a pharmacy.

“We are also planning to set up a market for Ribandar where the municipality satellite office will come up. That way people won’t have to come all the way to the city,” Madkaikar said.

196,['30/08/2020'],"Delhi: Difficult to run operations with just tuition fees, say private schools","Representative image

NEW DELHI: After Delhi high court upheld the April order of Delhi government on private schools charging only tuition fees “during the pendency of the lockdown”, many private schools have expressed unhappiness at not being able to collect development and other annual charges. They say it is difficult to run operations or pay salaries with just the tuition fees.

The court confirmed the government decision after the parents’ association of KR Mangalam World School took the Greater Kailash II institution to court for charging annual and development fees on pro rata basis from July. Prima facie, the court saw no reason to change the government order and on August 25, Justice Jayant Nath restrained the school from collecting such charges till further orders.

Parents of several other schools have also complained of having been billed for extra charges. One in south Delhi revealed, “The school asked us to pay operation fees, activity fees, newsletter charges, etc, along with the tuition fees for August.”

The case at DPS, RK Puram, is different. Parents have written to Delhi government complaining the school wasn’t charging development or annual charges, but had increased the tuition fees from Rs 9,100 till July to Rs 13,414 from August. However, the school’s public relations officer claimed to TOI to be unaware of any fee hike.

It was on April 18 that Delhi high court upheld the state government order that “no fee, except tuition fee, will be charged from parents during the lockdown period”. The order had also said the tuition fees were to be collected on monthly basis, not in quarterly or annual tranches. On August 21, deputy CM Manish Sisodia reiterated the government directive, disclosing that he was aware some private schools were increasing fees and transport and other charges.

The schools argue tuition fees alone aren’t enough to cover institutional expenses. Ameeta Wattal, principal, Springdales School, Pusa Road, said, “A third of our staff is coming to school; we have electricity, water and sanitation bills to pay. Schools are shut for children, but still open for normal work.” She explained that many teachers did not have internet facilities at home to conduct online classes and came to the school for these classes. “So, as you can see, the school’s stationery, gadgets, electricity, all are being used. Schools also have to carry out maintenance work,” said Wattal.

Another private school principal insisted that the tuition fees alone “could not meet the salary bill of teachers”. Saying that many parents weren’t even paying tuition fees, the principal reiterated, “While there are no physical classes, we still have to pay staff salaries, maintain the campus and pay electricity and other charges. For these we need development fees. While the court directed us not to charge other fees, it hasn’t commented on parents who don’t pay fees on time.”

Kamal Gupta, advocate for an umbrella body of private schools, said that “the schools had started to charge beyond the tuition fees in compliance with the order.” Gupta contended that the court’s observation was opposite Delhi government’s April 18 order. “The latest court order makes a distinction between the Covid lockdown and the physical reopening of schools. On the relaxation of the lockdown, we were open to charge not only the tuition fees but also the annual and development charges,” Gupta said.

The counsel claimed that Sisodia had agreed in an interview to a business daily that schools could not pay salaries with tuition fee collections. “The government has been changing its stance,” Gupta claimed. Despite several attempts to contact them, government officials did not offer a comment on the court order.

HYDERABAD: Ten persons from Uttar Pradesh, who made bids to burgle two jewellery shops in Patancheru, have been arrested by Cyberabad police. In one of the failed attempts, they even opened fire on a local, who saw the gang members drilling hole to enter the store.

Special Operation Team (SOT) of Cyberabad police and local cops arrested the accused, identified as Sakhi Ahmed, 38, Bijender Singh, 40, Irfan Ali Khan, 49, Haseen Mohammad, 51, along with six other associates, all from Budaun district of Uttar Pradesh, from Mallampet near Dundigal on Friday. They seized two country-made firearms, 15 live rounds along with other equipment from their possession.

The gang had attempted two burglaries in a span of five days in Patancheru of Sangareddy district.

On August 18, the gang went to a jewellery shop in Gokulnagar, Patancheru, and started drilling a hole to gain entry into the shop. The building owner, initially, screamed at the gang noticing their activity. Later, he called up the police after they started threatening him. However, the gang fled from the spot by the time a police team arrived.

On August 23 night, the gang again attempted burglary at a different jewellery shop in the same locality. A local, staying near the shop, saw the gang and shouted at them. “To threaten the local, the gang started breaking his house door using their equipment. Scared, the victim alerted us. Meanwhile, one of the gang members opened fire at his house but he escaped,” Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar said.

As both the incidents occurred in less than a week, the SOT swung in action to nab the gang. During the investigation, the team traced the movement of the gang to Ambedkar Nagar, Jagadgirigutta, and started following them. On Friday, when they were attempting to target another jewellery shop at Mallampet of Dundigal limit, the offenders were caught. They were arrested and booked for housebreaking.

199,['30/08/2020'],20 non-dalits resign from BJP demanding removal of party Tirunelveli district president,"Representative image

CHENNAI: For the BJP , trying to do social reengineering in the Dravidian heartland, caste divisions are giving hiccups. If L Murugan was appointed party state president to make inroads into the dalit community, appointment of another dalit, A Maharajan, as the party Tirunelveli district unit president is threatening to erode some existing base of the party.

More than 20 Nadar and Thevar district level functionaries have submitted resignations enmasse to party state vice-president Nainar Nagendran, resenting the appointment of A Maharajan. They have demanded the removal of Maharajan, citing lack of political decency and “behavioural problems”.

Maharajan joined the BJP in 2015 and held various posts, including that of the district general secretary. He contested from Tirunelveli assembly constituency on BJP ticket in the 2016 elections.

Another reason for the internal revolt is appointment of advocate R C Karthick, who joined BJP after quitting Thol Thirumavalavan’s VCK, as party’s district legal wing president. “Caste intolerance is the main problem in Tirunelveli,” said a state-level leader on condition of anonymity.

Those who have put in their papers have stopped participating in the party activities. “We will hold talks with the dissidents to sort out the problems,” said Nainar Nagendran, who is in charge of the southern districts.

Murugan’s appointment was considered by many as an attempt by the party to shed the image that the BJP is a party of the upper castes. “Non-dalit BJP functionaries in Tirunelveli are not in a mood to take instructions from Maharajan. It is a botheration for the party,” said another state-level leader, preferring anonymity.

However, a functionary from the Thevar community said, “The revolt has nothing to do with Maharajan’s caste. It is all about his attitude and lack of political decency.” He alleged that Maharajan attempted to assault BJP district secretary M Babu in the party office.

Maharajan denied the charges and said the issue was due to “personal dislikes” and refused to speak any further.

The youth threatened to stop vehicular traffic and supply of essentials from Karwar if the state borders are not opened from September 1.

They further threatened to hold a bigger protest from September 5 if “free traffic movement was not allowed”.

Representing the protesters gathered on the Karwar side of the border, Raghu Naik spoke to Canacona deputy collector Satish Prabhu and mamlatdar Vimod Dalal, who were also present at the spot, accusing the Goa government of harassing people from Karwar wanting to cross into Goa from Polem.

Naik further told Prabhu and Dalal that Goa government is modifying the Centre’s SOP for inter-state travel “as per their whims and fancies”.

“When Karnataka is supplying essential goods like milk, fish and vegetables, we find no reason as to why the Goa government is restricting free entry to the Karnatakis,” Naik said, accusing the state government of charging Rs 2,000 per person for entry into the state.

“In most cases, no receipts are issued nor are Covid tests done and when people demand receipts for the entry fee of Rs 2,000, people are being harassed and threatened with compulsory 14 days home quarantine,” Naik said, claiming that this allegation had gone viral on social media.

Naik also told the state authorities that Karwar MLA Rupali Naik had spoken to chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday, and conveyed the concerns of people from Karwar.

Meanwhile, former Karwar MLA Satish Sail has threatened to agitate on the Goa on Sunday.

The Canacona deputy collector told TOI that the Polem gates are open, and there are no restrictions provided those crossing have to undergo either health screening protocol, by paying Rs 2,000 or provide an ICMR approved certificate as per the government’s SOP.

Though the pandemic lockdowns brought about job and pay losses, the number of chit fund schemes registered at the registration department has increased post lockdown in the district. From as many as five chit schemes in June, their number has risen to 27 in July alone. But officials of the registration department have raised doubts whether the chit companies are getting monthly instalments.

“Companies are registering various schemes with us after paying fixed amounts. But we don’t know how many remit the premium,” said an official.

Association members of chit fund companies said there has been only a 25% drop in remitting the premium after the lockdowns set in. Still they have cautioned people to ensure that a scheme is registered with the department and that it has a registration number, before joining a scheme. The public can check these details at sub-registrar offices their areas.

“New chit fund schemes are being registered. Even I am going to register two new schemes. Most of our customers are traders and many have been hit hard by Covid-19. Many are unable to pay their instalments. But government employees and others who have a regular income continue to join in the schemes,” said K P Geevarghese Babu, state president of All Kerala Association of Chit Fund.

There are around 150 chit fund companies in Ernakulam .

204,['30/08/2020'],100 trained tribal youth to return as teachers to their communities,"CHENNAI: The state tribal welfare department has decided to train, appoint educated youth from the community as teachers in tribal schools in remote and hilly areas. Lack of teachers is a perennial issue in tribal schools.

The department has launched a programme to identify candidates who have completed Class XII to enroll them in teacher training institutes. They will be absorbed as regular teachers in tribal department-run schools once they complete the training.

“We have been receiving applications from eligible candidates. Once they get a diploma in teacher education (DTEd), which the department will pay for, they will be coached in private centres to clear the Tamil Nadu Teachers Eligibility Test (TET),” said a senior official in the department. A 100 vacancies are expected to be filled with the candidates who clear TET. “This move will help solve multiple issues in the schooling system in tribal areas,” said the official.

The programme is a move to improve the literacy rate of the tribal community, which is 54.34% (state average is 80%). Around 30,000 students are enrolled in 310 government tribal residential (GTR) schools in the state.

Welcoming the move, state vice president of Tamil Nadu Tribals’ Association P Shanmugam said it was their long pending demand. He, however, added it won’t address the immediate crisis as more than 50% of teachers’ postings were vacant in GTR schools. “We want the government to fill vacancies immediately,” he said and pointed out that there are nearly 20 vacancies in Karumandurai GTR school in Kalrayan hills, Salem, and 15 in the school in Semmedu in Kolli Hills for the past couple of years.

205,['30/08/2020'],Starting early: North corporation tries to reboot primary education,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has chalked out an education plan for approximately three lakh students studying in its 700 schools. The plan, which seeks to transform the conventional study system, will introduce social skill-oriented classes from the nursery level .

The project, which is drafted by the education department and is in the primary stage of implementation, seeks advance preparation of daily lesson plans, teachers’ training by experts and promotion of inclusive education at the primary level. Instead of the same teacher handling a class till Class V, subjects will be distributed among them as per their interests, capabilities, background and school requirements.

The plan comes at a point when New Education Policy 2020 is going to add a year of schooling at the nursery level, said an official. “We have been following a particular teaching pattern for decades. We need to bring in reforms to build a strong foundation of our students who will now spend one more year in nursery,” said Ira Singhal, education director at the corporation.

The project includes holistic learning, work distribution among teachers, implementing class teaching plans, and defining week-wise activities.

“For years, the teaching process focused on technical skills like reading and writing. But to make children confident and capable, we need to impart social skills and make them aware about road rules, elections, gender sensitisation, how to reach out to police and fire department in case of an emergency, waste segregation and ethical behaviour. We have proposed to hold one period every week on these subjects,” said Singhal.

Teachers will also be sensitised about various types of disabilities and meeting their needs in classrooms. “There is a plan to conduct regular workshops with the help of subject experts to teach all children in the same classroom,” said the official.

In the current system of a fixed teacher every year, learning becomes extremely teacher-dependent, said Singhal. “If the teacher is dedicated and sincere, the students benefit immensely; otherwise it would affect the whole primary foundation of students,” she pointed out.

The syllabus for each subject will be divided into 30 weeks. “A minute-to-minute teaching plan for each week and subject will be set as per NCERT guidelines and the same will be communicated to teachers,” said Singhal.

The corporation will soon ask teachers to apply online for transfer and once the process is over, they will be trained to handle the new process, the official said. While monitoring will be done periodically, the success of the project will largely depend on the dedication of teachers, Singhal said.

207,['30/08/2020'],"As another article alleges BJP bias in Facebook, Cong writes to Zuckerberg seeking details of probe","NEW DELHI: With a report in Time magazine alleging Facebook-BJP nexus, following a similar article by Wall Street Journal, Congress Saturday demanded a JPC investigation into the allegations that the social media giant was favouring the BJP government and lenient on hate speech for favours with its top India executives playing a liason role.

AICC general secretary K C Venugopal shot off a letter to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg asking for details on steps being taken to investigate the revelations made in the American publications . This is the second letter by Congress in less than a fortnight.

“We urge you to let us know what steps your company is planning to take to investigate these matters... we will also be pursuing legislative and judicial actions in India to ensure a foreign company cannot continue to cause social disharmony in our nation for pursuit of private profits,"" the letter said, alleging WhatsApp has willingly allowed itself to be appropriated for hate speech and tearing of India’s social harmony.

Speaking at a virtual function, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi accused Modi government of throwing India off track by giving primacy to “dictatorship over democracy” and of following the divide and rule strategy to spread hatred in society.

Congress said consecutive reports in US publications revealed Facebook had helped the ruling BJP manipulate public opinion. It said Time magazine has disclosed that WhatsApp was planning to launch its “digital payment operations” to exploit its base of 40 crore users in India and was dependent on Modi government for approvals and licence for the venture. It named a WhatsApp executive in its report.

Tagging the Time article, Rahul Gandhi tweeted to allege that proposed payment operations was the reason behind WhatsApp-BJP nexus.

AICC spokespersons Pawan Khera and Pravin Chakravarty said the JPC probe sought must go into how Facebook manipulated voter opinion and allowed hate speech, and demanded that the government should not give approvals to WhatsApp for its payment channel till the probe is complete and action taken.

Police have recovered the gold ornaments and a stolen bike from the trio.

The woman’s 80-year-old brother-in-law has also been arrested in the case for giving quotation to the trio to assault his brother.

The Karamadai police identified the accused as M Saravanan alias Saravanakumar, 40, of Mettupalayam, his accomplices V Arumugam, 54, of Karamadai and K Ravi alias Ravindran, 25, of Vadamangalakarai near Karamadai, and the woman’s brother-in-law Nataraj, of Kembanur. Saravanakumar is the north district secretary of VHP.

An investigation officer said Saravanakumar, who used to hold kangaroo court, had handpicked a few VHP cadres to indulge in assault and theft cases. “On the night of June 25, the trio entered the house of C Anitha, wife of Chandrasekaran, 50, of Kembanur, and took away her gold ornaments after assaulting her with a sickle. She couldn’t identify the robbers as they had covered their faces with mask.”

A schoolteacher with the elementary school at Pungampalayam, Anitha lodged a complaint with the Karamadai police, who registered a case under Sections 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), 397 (robbery or dacoity with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) and 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code.

Police arrested Saravanakumar and his accomplices on Friday. During investigation, they told police that Anitha’s husband had a land dispute with his elder brother Nataraj and a civil case was pending before court for many years.

“Nataraj approached Saravanakumar and told him to assault his brother. He also tipped him that his brother’s house was under the surveillance of three CCTV cameras. But when they entered the house, Anitha was alone there,” the officer said.

Based on the trio’s confessional statement, the Karamadai police arrested Nataraj on Saturday.

All the four are lodged in Pollachi sub-jail under judicial custody. District superintendent of police Ara Arularasu said, “We will move the court seeking custody of Saravanakumar and his accomplices for further investigation.”

The 15-coach train left for Patel Nagar in West Delhi, where it would reach on Monday night. It would stop in Tirupur, Erode, Salem, Renigunta and Nagpur on the way. The train would operate on every Saturday.

From Patel Nagar, it would commence the return journey on Wednesday early morning and reach the city on Friday night.

Parcel cargo express trains are designed to carry finished goods, have more width and length compared to goods trains and travel at a higher speed. An official said they won’t be ferrying materials like cement, rice and other items in gunny bags in the train.

The train was flagged off by Salem divisional railway manager Subba Rao and senior divisional commercial manager E Harikrishnan.

The train is leased to a private company for six years. The rain could carry 353 tonnes cargo. Each coach has a capacity to carry 23 tonnes. The guard’s coach could accommodate another eight tonnes. Every trip would fetch the railways Rs 26.8 lakh.

The Salem railway division had earlier floated tenders for parcel cargo express trains, which will be operated on a fixed schedule, from Coimbatore to Patel Nagar, Rajkot and Jaipur, and from Vanjipalayam to Guwahati.

Harikrishnan said, “A single company has taken the tender to operate it to Patel Nagar and Rajkot. The service to Rajkot will begin in another two weeks.” He said the parcel cargo service has more than tripled this year, compared to last year. “We have sent 194 parcel cargo coaches from the division between April and July, as against 59 last year.”

Officials also unveiled the plans to promote the city north railway station as the primary freight station. “We want textile units and makers of pumps, grinders, automotives and machineries to make use of the new service we offer. We can even run these trains to any destination daily, if we have business. We are speaking to industrial associations in the city to promote the new service,” another railway official said.

AYODHYA: The crumbling structures of centuries-old Ram Janamsthan temple, Sita Rasoi and Ram Chabutra are being cleared to pave way for a magnificent Ram temple on 67acre Janmabhoomi premises. The idol of Ram Lalla was worshipped on the Chabutra, adjacent to the walls of Babri mosque, before its demolition in 1992. The ancient idols in these shrines have been shifted and will be reinstalled when the temple comes up, said a member of the Ram temple trust.

The Ram Janamsthan temple complex was called Sita Rasoi in legal documents and by residents, particularly seers of the Gudar Ramchandra ascetic order. These shrines were acquired by the Union government in 1993 along with 67acre of then disputed site and formed the fulcrum of the court battle by Hindu litigants.

In his 2010 verdict, Justice SU Khan of Allahabad High Court acknowledged Sita Rasoi and Ram Chabutra were in existence before the Babri mosque. And this formed the basis for giving possession of land to three parties — Ram Lalla Virajaman, Nirmohi Akhara and Sunni Waqf Board . The bench had agreed the three structures, including ‘Bhandar Grah’ existed in the outer courtyard of the disputed site.

Faizabad officiating commissioner and settlement officer P Karnegi, had documented in 1866-67 that Ram Janamsthan temple was 166 years old, but as per belief the temple predates three thousand years.

Talking to TOI, Acharya Satyendra Das, chief priest of Ramjanmabhoomi temple, said, “Lord Ram was worshipped at the Ram Janam Sthan temple for centuries. Now, it will no longer exist.” However, Ram Mandir Trust clarified the idols have been kept away safely and will re-established after the completion of Ram temple.

On Saturday, the trust submitted blueprint and documents of Ram temple to the Ayodhya Development Authority for approval. Talking to TOI, trustee Anil Mishra said, “The plan has been given to the secretary of development authority, Niraj Shukla.”

Instead, the government should enforce a complete lockdown in the district for a few weeks to control the spread of Covid-19, they said.

“Most of our employees who left for their native places haven’t returned yet. Due to low business orders, most of the companies are functioning only four days a week with minimal workforce. We are struggling to pay salaries. In this situation, how can an employer afford to spend thousands of rupees every month to test employees?” asked president of the Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares Manufacturers Association (Kopma) K Maniraj.

“Our employees would not agree if we decide to deduct a percentage of testing fee from their salaries. In the absence of government support, some companies have borrowed and pledged properties to run business,” he added.

While a similar practise is not followed in other part of the state, why is the corporation insisting on it, asked J James, district president of the Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises (Tact). “If we had sufficient money, we would have increased the workers’ salary and even called them back from their native places. Instead of targeting us, the government should take steps to test all people,” he said.

President of the Coimbatore Jewellery Manufacturers’ Association B Muthuvenkatraman agreed. “Why is the government segregating our employees from the rest of the public? Even if I follow all the guidelines, including testing my employees every fortnight, they might catch the infection from customers or their family members. To control the spread of the virus, the government should impose complete lockdown and take steps to identify and treat the infected people.”

On Friday, members of the Joint Council of Associations of Coimbatore submitted a petition to collector K Rajamani, requesting him not to insist on testing workers in private labs once in 15 days and to test only those with symptoms at government centres.

Meanwhile, corporation sources said that the employees can also undergo testing at its medical camps that are conducted daily.

NEW DELHI: Observing that there are enough grounds to believe allegations against her are “prima facie true”, a Delhi court on Friday dismissed the bail plea of Pinjra Tod activist and Jawaharlal Nehru University student Devangana Kalita.

Kalita has been booked in several cases, including one under the stringent anti-terror law UAPA, in connection to her alleged role in the communal violence in northeast Delhi in February.

Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat said that the statements of protected witnesses, in the case before him where Kalita has sought bail, reflected her and other accused’s role in planning the activities at the protest sites against Citizenship Amendment Act as part of a “conspiracy”, which led to the riots.

ASJ Rawat, in observations that will come as a boost to the prosecution, noted that “the accused had planned and carried out a chakka-jam resulting in riots as part of the plan. The statements clearly point out the role of Kalita as also the other co-accused people and various actions taken by them in pursuance of the conspiracy.”

While dismissing the bail plea, the court relied on statements of witnesses on role of Kalita and other accused people, adding, “I have no hesitation to hold that there are reasonable grounds for believing that accusation against accused are prima facie true.”

The court found merit in the arguments of special public prosecutor Amit Prasad that the case file and case diaries reveal material to point towards the role of Kalita in the conspiracy and the riots.

ASJ Rawat noted that Kalita’s location was also found at protest sites in Jafrabad.

The tradition of taking out processions on the first 10 days of Muharrum was introduced by the Qutb Shahi kings about 500 years ago. And for the first time in five centuries, Hyderabad will not witness the grand procession of Bibi-ka-Alam on a caparisoned elephant winding through the lanes and bylanes of the historic localities of the city.In normal times, the Bibi-ka-Alam procession would begin from the historic Bibi-ka-Alawa at Dabeerpura and culminate near Chaderghat. Bibi-ka-Alam has a piece of wood used by Fatima Zehra, daughter of Prophet Mohammad. The plank was brought to Hyderabad during the period of Abdullah Qutb Shah VII.According to senior Islamic scholar Allama Ejaz Farruq, the wooden plank was framed to a standard (Alam) by Hayat Baksh Begum, mother of Abdullah Qutb Shah. She had also got beautiful Arabic calligraphy engraved on the Alam, covered with gold.Mourning sessions were also held with limited number of people at Ashoorkhanas in view of Covid-19 norms. There were no open sessions.At Badashahi Ashoorkhana, one of the first five buildings of Hyderabad when the city was founded in 1591, Bibi-ka-Alawa, Bargah Hazrat Abbas at Diwan Deodhi, Naal-e-Mubarak at Pathergatti and Alawa Sartauq and Azakhana Zehra at Darusshifa, mourning sessions were held.Muharrum observance has been a continuous affair in Hyderabad since the times of the Qutb Shahis even during the devastating Musi deluge of 1908, Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and several bouts of plague and cholera during the 19th and early 20th centuries.

237,['30/08/2020'],Man arrested for duping Chennai couple of Rs 4L,"Coimbatore: A 43-year-old man was arrested on Saturday for cheating a Chennai-based couple of Rs 4 lakh by promising them a loan of Rs 1 crore.

The Avinashi police in Tirupur district identified the accused as Sureshkumar, of Maniyakarampalayam in Coimbatore city.

A police officer said the couple - Alwin Rai and his wife Jennifer, of Perumalpuram extension at Tambaram in Chennai - had approached Sureshkumar, who introduced himself as Acharya, for a loan of Rs 1 crore to expand their truck transport business.

“Jennifer’s friend Kiruba told them about an advertisement in a newspaper that promised financial assistance for business purposes. Jennifer contacted the mobile phone number in the advertisement and the one who attended the call gave her another contact number of a person named Acharya,” the officer said.

She subsequently contacted the person, who agreed to arrange the loan and demanded Rs 4 lakh as document charges, which needed to be paid upfront. He also asked her to meet him at Avinashi on August 26.

“The couple met him on the agreed date and paid him Rs 4 lakh. He gave them a briefcase, which he said had the initial payment of Rs 55 lakh, and left the place. When the couple opened the briefcase, they found the currency notes were fake,”

Jennifer lodged a complaint with Avinashi police inspector Prema, who registered a case under Sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 489 B (using as genuine, forged or counterfeit currency-notes or bank-notes) of the Indian Penal Code the same day.

The Avinashi police arrested Sureshkumar on Saturday. Preliminary inquiry revealed Sureshkumar was involved in similar cases in Madurai district and Puliyampatti in Erode district. “He was also involved in stealing nine tonnes red sanders from a container depot at Irugur in Coimbatore in 2015,” the officer said.

238,['30/08/2020'],Cyber crooks dupe Delhi's AIIMS doctor of Rs 3 lakh in name of donation,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: A cardiologist at AIIMS was in for a shock when she realised that she had been duped of her hard-earned money by cyber crooks on the pretext of contribution for Covid-hit people.

In an email allegedly from the head of department’s account, which was spoofed by the crooks, she was asked to donate by buying Amazon gift cards and lost around Rs 3 lakh. A case was registered in May after the Cyber Cell was approached and two people were arrested from Kolkata in mid-August.

The accused have been identified as Saif Ahmad (21), a BBA student in supply chain management, and Saif Akhtar (26), an employee in a footwear firm. They created a fake website to offer Amazon gift cards by sending spoofed emails.

The money was then used for e-shopping and paying utility bills. The Amazon account that was used to redeem the gift cards belonged to Ahmad. Anvyesh Roy, DCP of Cyber Cell, confirmed the arrests.

The spoofed email also showed some other colleagues as marked, said an officer. “The mail had instructions to donate for the noble cause. Without wasting any time, she bought 54 gift card coupons online worth Rs 2.7 lakh. She even shared her contribution in an email,” he added.

The doctor realised the fraud only after speaking to a few colleagues, the officer said. She immediately reported the matter to the Cyber Cell and a case of cheating, impersonation and under the Information Technology Act was registered.

Investigating officials approached Amazon, which provided the digital trail of the use of the gift cards. The cell found that several websites also provided a platform for buying or selling stolen gift cards at heavy discounts in exchange of cryptocurrencies. These cards were traded in an almost real-time manner.

“People should always personally cross-check if they receive any mail for donation or transfer of money,” an investigating officer said.

The terms of the gram panchayats are about to expire and holding fresh polls have been withheld given the Covid-19 pandemic.

While 14 of the panchayats concerned are in the Kannad taluka, another 11 local self-governing bodies are in the Vaijapur taluka. As the tenures of the 25 gram panchayats are scheduled to end between August 30 and September 1, the school principals have been asked to take charge as an administrators accordingly.

The chief executive officers (CEO) of the ZP have been given power to appoint the administrators on the advice of the guardian minister of every district. The appointment would continue till the first meeting of a newly-elected gram panchayat body takes place. The CEO is also empowered to remove the administrator on ground of misconduct.

Kailas Gaikwad, the Aurangabad district secretary of association of primary ZP teachers, said school principals should not have been made administrator for multiple reasons. “The school principals do not hold any experience in heading local self-governing bodies. The principals may yield to pressure from locals while discharging their duties. They may also have to work in a school in these villages in the future,” he said.

One principal, preferring anonymity, said, “The government must have considered other options, including roping in Class II revenue officers, for the role of administrator.”

ZP school officials have also spelt out the list of non-academic work they have perform, including work related to election and census and the current pandemic-related duties.

When contacted, ZP authorities said school principals have been appointed as administrators as per the instructions from the government. “ZP school principals and teachers are among the trusted workforce available to the government. The principals appointed as administrators can work effectively with cooperation from other administrative authorities at the ZP,” a senior ZP official from the education department said.

240,['30/08/2020'],Amul gets legal protection from fraudulent websites,"VADODARA: In a big relief to home-grown dairy giant Amul, whose brand name is being exploited by online fraudsters, Delhi High Court (HC) has issued a blanket injunction restraining all registrars of domain names from selling domain name ‘Amul’ as a prefix or suffix in any combination.

For more than a year, the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation ( GCMMF ) that markets brand Amul – has been receiving complaints from victims who fall prey to online frauds through which fake websites impersonate ‘Amul’ and offer jobs, franchise and/or dealerships.

In its interim order, the court restrained domain registrars like GoDaddy, Name Cheap, Freenom, Big Rock among others from selling or offering for sale domain names with ‘Amul’ as suffix or prefix, in any combination.

“The court observed that being a well-known trademark – Amul – deserved such protection. The order to a large extent prevents further creation of fake websites,” said advocate Abhishek Singh, who made the submissions on behalf of Amul.

“The court has outrightly rejected the contention of GoDaddy that it is not aware as to whether there is any technology by virtue of which GoDaddy can ensure that the websites with name Amul therein will not be made available for sale,” he said.

between January and August alone, Amul had received complaints from 30-odd people from across the country that they were deceived by fake websites which illegally offered ‘Amul’ dealership, distributorships and jobs for which they deposited money in the range of Rs 25,000 to Rs ten lakh.

The victims were asked to deposit money in bank accounts with names like ‘Amul Brand Pvt Limited’, ‘Amul Union Limited’, ‘Amul Board Pvt Limited or ‘Amul India Ltd’ in branches of nationalized banks in Anand or in New Delhi.

The order passed by justice Mukta Gupta of Delhi HC on Friday also directed the Department of Telecommunications , the Ministry of Information Technology and the National Internet Exchange of India to block access to such websites.

Also, the court has further directed nationalized banks including the State Bank of India, Canara Bank , Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bandhan Bank, IndusInd Bank and Dena Bank to furnish all the details of the account holders, their address, contact details and bank statements of sixteen bank accounts in which victims of fraud were asked to deposit money.

Amul has already filed complaints with cybercrime cell. Last year, it had also issued notices to the registrars who sell such domain names.

“Until the properties are regularised, the properties whose application is pending will not be registered,” said T Chiranjeevulu, commissioner, registration and stamps (R&S) department.

As on date, BRS applications are being scrutinised and a verification report of all applications is being prepared. “In the report we are preparing, we have categorised the applications into two categories- shortfall of documents and rejected. But the final decision to mark the building as legal or illegal depends on the court,” said a GHMC official. Only after court’s decision, of the total 1.30 lakh property applications, the ones which are declared as eligible/ approved can be sold or purchased. As per GHMC records, in all circles, scrutiny of 70% BRS applications has been completed.

Further, the government is contemplating speeding up regularisation of plots under layout regularisation scheme (LRS) across the state. “Depending on number of applications received for regularisation, special counters at government offices will be set up. If needed counters will also be set up in district collectorates,” said an official from the municipal administration and urban development department.

242,['30/08/2020'],Owners opt for TDR over cash for govt-acquired land,"HYDERABAD: Property owners, whose land had been acquired by government for construction of slip/link roads, have preferred to take transferable development rights (TDR) worth Rs 500 crore — selling price of land acquired — over monetary compensation .

“A total 200 properties were acquired for construction of 37 slip roads. Though the count of properties is low, land acquired to lay these roads is higher compared to road widening,” said a GHMC official.

TDR allows for additional built-up area in lieu of area acquired for execution of government projects. As per Hyderabad Road Development Corporation Limited (HRDCL) records, of the 37 link roads, construction of 10 roads has been completed. The preference for TDR has given the government the impetus to push ahead with work on other projects without having to shell out for cash compensations.

TDR has been beneficial for land owners as some have gotten benefits close to 400% over the value of their property. In case of cash compensations, they are entitled to 200% compensation based on government rate. An official said that apart from additional property value, the provision to sell or purchase TDR has also been an attractive factor. “Under TDR, the extra built-up area could either be utilised by the property owner or sold to others which is a reason builders and realtors come forward to opt for TDR,” said a GHMC official.

On Saturday, the proposed link road from Nallgandla main road near Ratnadeep supermarket to Old Mumbai Highway was inspected by GHMC officials and public representatives. Post-inspection, Hyderabad mayor Bonthu Rammohan said the Nallagandla lake will be developed into a picnic spot. “Mayor directed the officials to put up estimates for development of Nallagandla lake which include facilities like walking track, lung space and construction of boundary wall,” the GHMC said in a statement.

The agency, in its FIR, booked the company’s current director Avasarala Venkateswara Rao and former director P Chandrashekar Reddy, both residents of AS Rao Nagar, on charges under criminal conspiracy, forgery, cheating and Prevention of Corruption Act.

This is the second CBI case booked against Servomax India, housed in Cherlapally Industrial Area, for loan fraud. In February 2018, a case had been booked following a complaint by State Bank of India (SBI). The CBI, in its FIR back then, had alleged that the company had an outstanding balance of Rs 299 crore towards SBI and another Rs 104 crore towards Indian Overseas Bank.

In its latest FIR, registered on Friday, CBI claimed that forensic audit had revealed the company had diverted the funds through fictitious company debtors and routed the money through current accounts of other banks.

The SBI has red-flagged the company account. Between 2011 and 2014, the accused directors floated numerous companies — Neutrino Power Systems, Murali Krishna Power Controls, Akhila Electronics Products, Spillezer Electronics — in the name of employees and shareholders.

Letters of credit worth around Rs 30 crore and Rs 15 crore had allegedly been given to Murali Krishna Power and Spillezer Electronics respectively. Payments were reportedly made to a foreign bank in Bahrain and transactions were made with related entities. Along with this, inconsistencies were found in the balance sheet.

Some of the companies with which transactions were made are not found in MCA records. The CBI’s Banking Securities and Fraud Cell in Bengaluru is investigating the two cases.

This, considering the fact that they face health issues due to long and unusual working hours leading to insufficient rest.

The survey took responses from around over 2,000 respondents from six cities including Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi NCR, Jaipur, and Lucknow. Conducted by the Indian Federation of App-based Transport workers (IFAT), in collaboration with the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), the survey showed that an alarming 73.5% respondents did not have any form of health insurance or mediclaim policy either for them or for their families.

The data collected through interviews, polls and questionnaires further revealed that majority of taxi drivers suffer from backache, constipation, liver issues, waist pain and neck pain. A significant number of respondents, nearly 60%, identified backache as a major health issue. The survey also focused on harassment faced by drivers from customers, traffic officials, and aggregators which significantly affected their mental health.

“Irrespective of age and income group, most drivers are unable to contribute even a single month’s earnings to their annual expenditure on health. We recently submitted a representation to the prime minister as well as the transport minister to ensure that aggregators provide health insurance,” said IFAT national general secretary, Shaik Salauddin. Earlier this week, transport workers across the country, had urged the government to provide insurance coverage to drivers and workers who had been risking their lives to transport people, essentials amid a pandemic.

Students in Telangana have been asked to attend the online classes which will be telecast on DD Yadagiri, Saptagiri and T-SAT network.

However, the grim reality for many students, not just in Mahabubabad, is that they do not have either a TV set at home, a computer or a mobile phone with Internet facility, sources said.

As the new academic year 2020-21 rolls out amid the pandemic after a long delay, officials are asking the gram panchayats to provide TV sets for the benefit of students. Mahabubabad district collector VP Gautam asked the panchayats to seek cooperation of the pubic representatives in this endeavour. Cable operators have also been asked by collectors to see that there is no interruption in the telecast.

There are 27,073 students in Mahabubabad. Authorities have identified that 8,000 students have mobile phones with Internet facility and another 10,000 students have mobile phones but no Internet facility.

Since it is not a face-to-face interaction, students can call up their teachers to clear any doubts . Their numbers will be displayed at all panchayat offices.

Kamareddy district collector A Sharath asked that arrangements be made in the panchayat offices and also government offices wherever necessary for students to attend the online classes by watching the telecast.

252,['30/08/2020'],MLA steps in to make south Delhi forest safer for women,"AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj deployed a team of women volunteers in the park so that they can keep any eye out fo... Read More

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj was shocked to hear a woman complaining that while walking in the Jahanpanah City Forest in south Delhi, some men had harassed her while she was taking a walk through the densely wooded area and flashed their private parts at her. Bharadwaj informed Delhi Police who visited the area and met other women there. None of the woman joggers, however, disclosed the need to lodge any official complaint.

On August 16, Bharadwaj, member of the legislative assembly from the Greater Kailash constituency, received a call from a woman who said she went to the forest for morning walks. The woman revealed that some miscreants in the park always tried to disturb women and at times even made obscene remarks at them.

“I spoke to the area DCP, and the following day the assistant commissioner of police reached the forest with two inspectors,” said Bharadwaj. “We collectively patrolled the forest area and spoke to many women. At least six of them did admit to uncomfortable moments during their morning and evening walks. But in front of the police, none of them wanted to file a complaint. The police officers have been supportive and are regularly present in the forest area.”

Two siblings who are regulars at the park informed the MLA of the time they were walking on the jungle trail and a man followed them. “The man then exhibited his private parts to the girls,” Bharadwaj claimed. “Some boys apparently come and sit and play loud music in the park. The forest area is frequented by joggers and walkers, men, women or children. The security staff has been briefed and we have told people to click pictures in case they notice anything inappropriate.”

The MLA has also deployed a team of women volunteers in the park so that they can keep any eye out for anti-social elements and are approachable for women joggers. He felt the women he met might have desisted from police complaints out of embarrassment or under social pressure.

Atul Thakur, DCP (South) maintained that police had not received any official complaint about harassment. “We carry out patrolling in the park on motorcycles and even bicycles. Police officers in plainclothes are also on rounds regularly,” said Thakur.

253,['30/08/2020'],Telangana: Poor left in a fix as authorities drag feet over ration card applications,"As per official records, nearly 78,000 ration card applications are pending clearance

HYDERABAD: Pending ration card applications , some for over a year, with civil supplies department was a major hurdle for thousands from the marginalised sections of society who could not get access to food supplies during the nation-wide lockdown .

“When my fingerprint was not recognised by the machine at our local ration shop, I was told that the ration card was not operational,” B Raj Kumari, a 33-year-old physically challenged resident of Secunderabad told STOI. She is struggling to avail government aid as her ration card application is pending for over a year. Despite re-applying twice last year, Kumari said that her application is yet to be cleared by the authorities.

“I can’t walk properly, and it is very difficult for me to go the ration shop every now and then to check if my application has been approved. I also need the ration card so that I can get the Aarogyasri services and get my knee surgery done,” said Kumari.

As per official records, nearly 78,000 ration card applications are pending with the authorities. In 2019, only around 7,400 applications out of nearly 59,000 applications were approved while 2,610 were rejected. “Since 2016, the department has received around 1,50,000 applications of which over 60,000 are pending and close to 29,000 were rejected. Despite several requests from applicants, there has been no progress in resolving the issue,” said RTI activist Mohammad Shafi.

Another applicant waiting for his ration card application’s approval is Syed Mihraj of Shaheen Nagar in Old City. Mihraj said that there are over 40 families in his locality who are in a similar position. “I applied for a ration card for myself and my family members before the state elections in December 2018. It has been two years and still there is no progress,” he said.

When contacted, district civil supplies official C Padma said, “There is no time specification on how long it might take to process the applications but as of now, we are not doing it. We are waiting for government order for approval of these applications.”

254,['30/08/2020'],"Aurangabad: Harsul Savangi likely to overflow, warning issued","The water level at Harsul Savangi is just 5 feet below its brim

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation issued a warning on Saturday that the mini-dam constructed on Harsul Savangi may soon overflow and water may enter surrounding farms and residential areas. As per the official records, last time this dam overflowed was in 2010.

Authorities said the water level at the Harsul Savangi is just 5 feet below its brim. Once it overflows, there could be temporary flooding in low-lying areas as well as the places in the path of the flowing water. The overflowing water will pass through Naregaon, Gadenagar, Chikalthana to reach the Garkheda-based pond. Over the years, Maniknagar and Gadenagar, situated along the banks of the tributary carrying water to Garkheda, have become densely populated.

As per the estimation of the civic body authorities, especially those associated with the water supplies department, Harsul Savangi may start overflowing any time now. “Considering the amount of rainfall we have already received and the expected showers, one good spell is enough to fill up the waterbody completely and make it overflow,” they said.

Aurangabad municipal administrator Astik Kumar Pandey has issued an official statement appealing residents of these areas to take precautions. He went on to state that the civic body will not be responsible in case the residents suffer any losses from the overflowing of the water.

Meanwhile, the historic Harsul water tank has already been overflowing and disrupting lives in low-lying areas of the city.

The terms of the gram panchayats are about to expire and holding fresh polls have been withheld given the Covid-19 pandemic.

While 14 of the panchayats concerned are in the Kannad taluka, another 11 local self-governing bodies are in the Vaijapur taluka. As the tenures of the 25 gram panchayats are scheduled to end between August 30 and September 1, the school principals have been asked to take charge as an administrators accordingly.

The chief executive officers (CEO) of the ZP have been given power to appoint the administrators on the advice of the guardian minister of every district. The appointment would continue till the first meeting of a newly-elected gram panchayat body takes place. The CEO is also empowered to remove the administrator on ground of misconduct.

Kailas Gaikwad, the Aurangabad district secretary of association of primary ZP teachers, said school principals should not have been made administrator for multiple reasons. “The school principals do not hold any experience in heading local self-governing bodies. The principals may yield to pressure from locals while discharging their duties. They may also have to work in a school in these villages in the future,” he said.

One principal, preferring anonymity, said, “The government must have considered other options, including roping in Class II revenue officers, for the role of administrator.”

ZP school officials have also spelt out the list of non-academic work they have perform, including work related to election and census and the current pandemic-related duties.

When contacted, ZP authorities said school principals have been appointed as administrators as per the instructions from the government. “ZP school principals and teachers are among the trusted workforce available to the government. The principals appointed as administrators can work effectively with cooperation from other administrative authorities at the ZP,” a senior ZP official from the education department said.

HYDERABAD: Two offenders were arrested on Saturday by Hyderabad police for fraudulently withdrawing money from three ATM kiosks recently. They came all the way from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to carry out the fraud in the city.

The arrested offenders were identified as Pramod Kumar, 28 from Khanpur Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, and Santosh Kumar, 41, from Kota, Rajasthan. Three of their associates — Ajay Shankar, Kamalkanth and Pawan— were absconding.

On August 10, 11 and 12, the offenders withdrew Rs 1.1 lakh from ATMs at SR Nagar, Nampally and Narayaguda. Later, the gang used to reach out to banks, complaining even though money was debited from the account, cash was not dispensed.

Based on their complaints, National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) re-credited the amount into their accounts. Police identified the offenders and nabbed two of the five members on Saturday when they came to Hyderabad again to commit a similar offence at Nampally.

258,['30/08/2020'],Delhi-Doon highway: Elevated stretch gets NHAI nod after WII report shows wildlife movement on route,"Meerut: The proposed elevated road -- part of the Rs 10,000 crore Delhi-Dehradun highway -- that would pass through the reserved forest of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand to connect Saharanpur to Dehradun has been accepted by the National HIghways Authority of India in “letter and spirit”.

This was done after the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) on the basis of its rapid assessment of the wildlife movement using camera trap technique found that the stretch is intensively used by a wide variety of wild animals including leopards, elephants, sambhar, etc.

As a result, 80% of the 19.6 km stretch will be developed as an elevated road.

Pankaj Maurya, project director, NHAI for Dehradun and under whose jurisdiction this stretch falls, said, ""We are complying 100% with the mitigation measures suggested by the WII. Besides, the alignment of the elevated corridor will be in such a way that it minimizes the felling of trees. The aim is to build the road, but not disturb the prevailing environment.""

According to the NHAI, the stretch that would come up at an estimated cost of Rs 2060 crore will take around three years to complete.

According to the WII report, the stretch of NH72 between Ganeshpur and Dehradun passes through an extraordinarily rich wildlife area. Proximity of this road to Rajaji Tiger Reserve and the adjoining wildlife rich area of Shivalik Forest Division of UP are largely responsible for this rich assemblage of wildlife species along this stretch of road. Based on the intensity of camera captures of all wild animals on the three zones of NH72 between Ganeshpur and Dehradun, wildlife crossing zones were demarcated.

""It's a welcome change focused at maintaining the region's delicate biodiversity,"" said WII director Dhananjay Mohan.

The ambitious project, which will cut down the travel time between Delhi and Dehradun to 2.5 hours, has attracted a lot of criticism from the experts as it also involves felling of 2,572 British-era Sal trees that will ""disturb the perfect habitat of leopards, tigers and elephants"".

259,['30/08/2020'],Resolution passed for no idol immersion in Godavari,"Aurangabad: With an aim to prevent pollution of Godavari river, the gram panchayat in Kaygaon village as well as the Rameshwar temple trust have unanimously passed a resolution not to allow immersion of idols in the river.

As per the resolution, idols can be immersed only at the artificial pond that has been constructed on the banks of Godavari river. Every year, people from far-off places make a beeline to immerse the idols, a majority of which are made of Plaster of Paris, in Godavari river which passes through Kaygaon toka on the busy Aurangabad – Pune highway.

The idea to have an artificial pond for immersion of idols was floated by superintendent of Aurangabad rural police Mokshada Patil. Accordingly, inspector of Gangapur police station Machindra Survase brought members of Rameshwar temple trust and the gram panchayat on the discussion table and the resolution was passed immediately.

Going a step ahead, police have also roped in local farmers to collect ‘nirmal’ (flowers and petals) offered to the idols to discourage people from dumping them in the artificial pond and pollute it further.sSurvase told TOI, “All the nirmal collected on the day of immersion will be used by local farmers for making high-quality organic compost, which can be used for making the farms more fertile.”

With this decision, fire brigade authorities have heaved a sigh of relief as the possibility of accidental drowning cases at the Godavari river, which due to heavy rainfall in and around the region is flowing with high currents, will be lesser.

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court recently granted anticipatory bail to four people who were booked for allegedly assaulting an assistant police inspector (API) and his staff at Ambi in Osmanabad in July 2020.

An FIR was registered at the Ambi police station stating that the police officer and his staff tried to reason with a businessman on removing the vehicles parked in the middle of the road at Anala Chowk when the applicants, Laxman Hanumant Mukte (31), Machindra Appasaheb Kadam (30), Nitin Bibhishan Shinde (40) and Motilal Devichand Gadiya (60), all resident of Anala in Paranda taluka of Osmanabad, allegedly assaulted him. The four booked approached the high court seeking anticipatory bail through lawyer Sayyed Tauseef Yaseen.

While allowing the applications, Justice R G Avachat ordered that “in the event of arrest, the applicants be released on executing Personal Recognizance (PR) bond in the sum of Rs.15,000 each with one surety each in the like amount.”

The bench observed, “The record indicates that the applicant (Motilal) had made a complaint to the superintendent of police, Osmanabad alleging the informant (API) had abused and assaulted him and his family members in the morning of July 9. The superintendent of police, Osmanabad,had asked the S.D.P.O. to inquire into the incident. The enquiry officer gave clean chit to the informant herein.”

The bench further observed, “...the F.I.R. has been lodged a few hours after the applicant (Motilal) made a complaint to the superintendent of police against the informant herein. The applicants have, therefore, reason to contend that false FIR has been lodged. Even if we take the allegations in the FIR. as it is, no custodial interrogation of the applicants is required.”

According to forest department officials, the carcass, which was in a partially decomposed state, was first spotted by people from Thoomanur tribal settlement when they went to the forest to graze the cattle. “They immediately alerted us.”

Forest department field staff and veterinarians subsequently examined the carcass and conducted postmortem. The carcass was later left in the reserve forest for scavengers.

An official said an elephant calf was found dead in the same locality on August 18.

Meanwhile, the forest department has started treating the makhna (tuskless male elephant), which the Kerala forest department had tranquilized a couple of days ago and treated for its wound in the mouth after it entered their territory on August 16.

They released the elephant, which is nicknamed bulldozer, back into the forest after keeping it under observation for 18 hours. The elephant then moved towards the Coimbatore forest range.

On Thursday, the elephant was spotted in Narasipuram area of Boluvampatti forest range. “Immediately, we formed a special team to monitor the animal, which is in Vettaikaran Kovil area of Narasipuram forest section,” an official said.

As per the advice of forest veterinary officer Dr Sukumar, medicines are being given to the elephant. “We placed rice and maize flour that were mixed with powdered tablets, and bananas and watermelon on its pathway. The elephant has taken all the food,” the officer said.

D Venkatesh, district forest officer, said medicines would be provided to the elephant at regular intervals until it recovers from the wound.

262,['30/08/2020'],Two lakh poor quality engineers to pass out as arrear exams scrapped: Experts,"Representative image

CHENNAI: The cancellation of all arrears exams for engineering students in Tamil Nadu, due to Covid-19, may in one stroke bring down the value of lakhs of hard earned degrees and ensure that at least two lakh students without basic understanding in key subjects become engineers, say experts.

It may also damage the reputation of Anna University and lead to genuine students being overlooked for courses of higher education or employment due to loss of credibility, they add.

The government announced that all students with arrears (except final semester) who have registered and paid fees for exams will be exempted from writing exams and they will be promoted.

There are currently 4,01,226 engineering students with arrears in TN. “Of the two lakh students now set to receive degrees without clearing exams, one lakh have finished college and 10,000 have exhausted all attempts to clear arrears,” a professor said. Currently, one student has been found to have 61 arrears out of 68 papers, he said.

B Chidambararajan, principal of Chennai-based Valliammai Engineering College, said a student can clear 6-10 papers in one semester. “If students with more arrears are promoted without writing exams, the value of degrees will be lost. Even now many companies don’t rely on semester marks to select candidates,” he said.

Almost all private companies have a robust recruitment process and will not take up students without screening them, he said. “If any of such candidates join the public sector, it will have very serious consequences,” he said, suggesting an exit test for students with many arrear .

The concept of getting students to arrear exams is to enable them to acquire sufficient knowledge in a subject, said M A Maluk Mohammed, director and correspondent of MAM College of Engineering and Technology in Trichy. “Citing Covid-19 scenario, we cannot pass all students with arrears. It is making a mockery of the system.” The government can come up with innovative solutions like online exams or open book exams, he said.

E Balagurusamy, former vice-chancellor of Anna University, said universities are not ration shops to distribute free degrees.

“There is no need to declare students with arrears passed with such urgency. Many finished college years ago and have been appearing for arrear exams for several years. They can wait for a few more months.”

All India Council for Technical Education chairman Anil D Sahasrabudhe wondered how a student who failed a course could be given a degree. “Such students will not be valued by industry or other higher educational institutes and would not get jobs. What is the use of such degrees?”

263,['30/08/2020'],"TOI Impact: After UP govt seeks report on 12,000-acre ‘forest land grab’, district admits revenue records were fudged","Meerut: Days after a TOI report on the alleged land grab of 12,000 acres in the wildlife corridor land between Corbett and Rajaji national parks, the UP revenue department sought an explanation from the Bijnor district administration which, in turn, responded that revenue records of at least one village were fudged.

“The Lucknow administration has sought information on the allegation, based on the TOI report,” Bijnor district magistrate Ramakant Pandey said. “But let me tell you, the discrepancy dates back to the early ‘50s. Rules were different then. Nevertheless, a committee has been formed and records of other villages are being checked as well. If any anomaly is found, appropriate action will be taken.”

The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), which operates under the Union environment ministry, had earlier asked the UP government for a report on the encroachment on Najibabad forest division by private players who had faked documents of ownership. The state government then asked the district administration. In response, the office of the district magistrate admitted to finding prima facie evidence that the revenue records of Telipada village were fudged.

Telipada is one of the 12 villages that had been flagged by a whistleblower, a stenographer at the office of the sub divisional magistrate of Nagina, Kishan Chand. These were places on the wildlife corridor where forest land was being diverted to private owners by fudging revenue records, he had complained to senior officials last year, adding that the land titles were then transferred to others who used them to apply for mining tenders or farming leases. The wildlife corridor in question connects Corbett National Park and Rajaji National Park, both in Uttarakhand, which tigers and elephants frequent.

On Saturday, Chand contested the dismissal of the problem by the district magistrate. “The practice of manipulating records continued well beyond the ‘50s. And which law justifies river beds being handed over to private players?” he asked. The river bed he referred to is that of the Kho, a tributary of the Ganga, the banks of which had also allegedly been “registered” by entrepreneurs from Punjab, Assam, Rajasthan and UP. The NTCA notice had come after a lawyer, Gaurav Bansal, had filed a complaint with the Union environment ministry. He said, “Since those investigating the land grab are themselves suspects in the case, we will move the court to direct an independent agency like CBI to investigate.”

266,['30/08/2020'],Door-to-door screening starts to identify suspected Covid patients,"Nagpur: The team of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), collector office and police department has started door-to-door survey and screening to identify suspected Covid-19 patients. The motive is to detect positive cases early and provide treatment to control deaths.

Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar told TOI that majority of Covid-19 positive deceased had been reported late to Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH). “Patients of Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and comorbidities are not doing for Covid-19 test after onset of symptoms while some are taking treatment for other diseases. Drive has been launched to check oxygen saturation level and temperature of people with symptoms. People will be suggested to get done test immediately in case of any symptoms of Covid,” he said.

Kumar added that the drive will cover areas with high caseload followed by remaining localities.

Additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma said team has been constituted at the level of 28 police stations. “Around 2,000-2,500 members are from NMC, police, collector office and NGOs.”

The NMC and police department have involved interested NGOs, members of District Peace Committee and corporators to get cooperation from the people.

President of Pujya Sindhi Panchayat Khamla, Narayan Ahuja, and member Mohan Chawla said, “Drive will benefit in identification of cases and save lives if continued with dedication. We as a community and also member of District Peace Committee will accompany the team. Team is taking oxygen saturation level and also noting down all details of family members,” he said.

In April, the civic body had conducted survey of high-risk people.

Meanwhile, the NMC in association with RSS Lokkalyan Samiti has also launched Mission Vishwas. “Due to the large number of positive cases, the government system is proving to be inadequate. NMC has therefore decided to take the help of social organizations for this cause,” the Samiti said.

Under ‘Mission Vishwas’, the volunteers of the Samiti will coordinate with NMC zonal medical officers and help them prepare list of suspects who have come in contact with positives patients. “The suspects will be encouraged to get tested at the earliest. Volunteers also help patients’ families to meet urgent requirements like medicines etc. In last few days, more than 7,000 positive patients were contacted by the volunteers. They are joined by volunteers of ‘Sevankur, an NGO working among the medical students,” the Samiti said.

The Samiti added that it also provides counselling to boost the morale of the patient and the families. “Approximately 20 volunteers per zone are rendering their services. The volunteers take proper precautions like maintaining Covid distancing, using face mask, face shields, gloves etc.”

The Samiti had distributed ration and daily necessity kits to around 60,000 needy people during full lockdown.

The family of the slain soldier — Prashant Sharma (22) who joined the Rashtriya Rifles of the Indian Army in 2017 — in Muzaffarnagar was informed about his death on Saturday morning. “The officer on the phone told us that Prashant sustained bullet injuries during the anti-terrorist operation and was rushed to a hospital, where he died during the treatment,” said Nishant Sharma, the soldier’s brother.

“He lost his life after killing three terrorists. My son sacrificed his life for the country,” said his father Sheeshpal Sharma, a former Army man.

According to family members, Prashant was to get married to a Meerut-based girl on December 6, and thus, Sharma was giving a face-lift to his house in Budhana Mode locality.

After getting information, locals in a large number, government officials and politicians, including Muzaffarnagar city MLA and Uttar Pradesh minister Kapil Dev Aggarwal, visited Sharma’s house to condole the grieving family. His last remains, however, are expected to reach late tonight.

Sharma was the second soldier from Muzaffarnagar who lost his life in anti-terrorist operations in Kashmir in a week. On August 21, Mohit Kumar (23), an Army jawan hailing from Gadi Nowabad village under Bhorakalan police station of Muzaffarnagar, was found dead at a forward post along the Line of Control (LoC) in Poonch sector of Jammu and Kashmir on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday last week.

NEW DELHI: The AAP government and the lieutenant governor have once again locked horns, this time over conducting the Joint Entrance Exam and the National Eligibility Entrance Test . LG Anil Baijal has rejected a Delhi government proposal requesting him to not allow the JEE and NEET in the national capital. The AAP government is opposed to conducting the competitive examinations, which, it believes, may expose candidates to the risk of getting infected by the novel coronavirus.

According to a Delhi government source, Baijal has rejected the proposal and returned the file to the elected government. “The file was sent to the LG, highlighting the risk of Covid-19 while conducting the examinations,” said the sources. The government also underlined that maintaining social distancing among the candidates outside the test centres would be a challenging affair, increasing the risk. It is likely that the Delhi Disaster Management Authority may permit holding the examination in the capital.

Recently, Delhi’s education minister Manish Sisodia asked the Centre to reconsider its decision of holding the exams in the prevailing pandemic. Sisodia urged the central government to either postpone the tests or find an alternative way of conducting them.

“The Centre has closed its eyes to the Covid-19 ground reality. Why is it forcing 28 lakh students to sit for the exams? They are saying they will make all the necessary arrangements. But despite the arrangements till now, so many people have tested positive,” Sisodia recently said on the Centre’s decision to hold the examinations.

In a letter to education minister Ramesh Rokhriyal Nishank, Sisodia recently stated, “We have to accept that the country is still in the grip of corona. In Delhi and a few other states, situation may be better, but in other states, cases of infection by Covid-19 are on the rise.”

The project is likely to take off in the fourth week of October coinciding with Dasara festival.

With power, water connections and access roads provided in these 2,000 acres, the government has decided to go ahead with land allotment, senior officials said. Principal secretary, industries, Jayesh Ranjan told STOI that once the land is handed over to the industries, it should take at least one-and-a-half years to get their operations rolling.

“Even as infrastructure works in the acquired land are being taken up, acquisition of additional land will also be completed soon,” a Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) official said.

A high-power committee led by chief secretary Somesh Kumar has been constituted along with members like principal secretaries of industries and finance to finalise the modalities for allotment of the land to the pharma firms and to scrutinise the applications. Ranjan said they have already received several applications for allotment of 11,000 acres.

“Balance land allotment will be made in phases,” he said. Applications have come from Bulk Drug Manufacturers’ Association and individuals.

“Firms have to apply individually for land allotment with their detailed project reports,” Ranjan said. Officials said local companies, operating from industrial areas within the Outer Ring Road area in Greater Hyderabad, would be preferred while allotting the land.

Government already asked polluting units, numbering around 1,600, to move out of city as it is ready to allot land for them outside the Outer Ring Road limits.

While about 9,000 acres land has already been acquired, another 5,000 acres is being acquired in Yacharam and Kanukuru mandals of Ranga Reddy district for two phases of Pharma City.

The government had launched the pharma city project at Mucherla, on the outskirts of the city, five years ago.

Over the last few years, the Cantonment police station of Aurangabad city has registered a number of offences against the toll plaza known for forcing truck drivers, especially those hailing from other cities and states, to purchase multiple VET bills, instead of one bill of Rs 60.

In the past, transporters had also raised questions over the Cantonment police’s alleged attempt to silence several complaints against the toll plaza which is run by a private contractor.

Activist Shafiq Ansari said, “Despite raising the issue for years, there has not been any permanent solution to the financial harassment that truck drivers face. Now, we plan to move the high court for the redressal of our grievances.”

However, authorities in the Cantonment Board said that they have acted on every complaint received. CEO of Aurangabad Cantonment Board Vikrant More told TOI, “On all the complaints reaching us, we ensure probe followed by appropriate action.”

The officer welcomed the suggestion to mandatorily have registration numbers mentioned on the toll tax bills.

273,['30/08/2020'],"Civic officials barricade immersion ghats in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad","A barricade near Wakad ghat to prevent devotees from immersing Ganapati idols in the Mula waters

PUNE: Most immersion ghats along the rivers in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad have been barricaded after several families turned up at the riverfront to immerse Ganapati idols through various days of the festival. The civic authorities have arranged for mobile immersion tanks and appealed to people to immerse idols at the pandal or at home to prevent crowding at ghats that could lead to further spread of Covid-19.

Although authorities have prohibited immersion of idols in the river or in artificial tanks along the river, many devotees reached the ghats to immerse the Ganesh idol on the 1.5th day, third day, sixth day and seventh day of the festival. Unaware of where to go to immerse the idols, many simply waited along the riverside for clear instructions. According to officials from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and the Pune police, the river banks have been barricaded in anticipation of more people reaching the ghats for immersion on Anant Chaturdashi .

“Immersion in the river or artificial tanks along the riverside is not allowed this year. We had appealed to people to immerse idols at home or in mobile tanks provided by us. While most people are following the instructions, the police have installed barricades in anticipation of people coming to the riverside for immersion on the last day,” said Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of the solid waste management department at PMC.

Inspector Deepak Lagad of Deccan police station said, “We have barricaded all seven ghats in areas under our jurisdiction to prevent people from conducting immersion in the river, which is not allowed this year due to the pandemic. We had begun sealing the entry points to the immersion ghats before the 7th day and we saw that people had come to the ghats for immersion. As a preventive measure, we have sealed entry to all immersion ghats.”

Executive engineer at Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), Prashant Patil said, “To ensure that nobody enters the water bodies for immersion, we have barricaded entrances to all the immersion ghats along the rivers in Pimpri Chinchwad. Over the last few days, we have received around 22,000 Ganesh idols for immersion. The appeals made earlier to avoid going to the ghats for immersion seem to have worked.”

274,['30/08/2020'],Lucknow double murder: Girl drew ‘inspiration’ from Japanese writer’s character,"Police inspect the railway officer’s house on Saturday

LUCKNOW: The 14-year-old girl who is accused of shooting her mother and brother is a national shooting champion and has also been a meritorious student. She is inspired by Japanese author Osamu Dazai , who talks about estrangement of the individual from society.

Police stumbled upon the revelation after the confession of the girl in presence of women cops and a counsellor.

A senior officer who interrogated the girl said she used to follow the characters of Dazai.

“A character in Dazai’s novel called Oba Yozo tries to adapt, cope and fit in but fails to become a human. The girl identified with that. In her notebook, she has scribbled “to fail to be human, to be disqualified as a human being”. This is an excerpt from the book Longer Human by Dazai,” said the officer.

The girl told police that on Saturday, after having lunch, her brother and mother had gone to sleep. The girl went to the bathroom, took a shower and then with fruit jam scribbled ‘I am a disqualified human’, on the mirror. She also shot at the bathroom mirror. She later came out and shot at the temple of her mother and brother who were asleep,” the officer said. The officer also said that the pistol was registered in the name of her father. The counsellor also said that the girl used to imagine herself as the characters in Dazai’s novel and react in a similar way. Cops also recovered a toy ‘skull’ and other grotesque photos from inside her room.

Teachers of a prominent city school where the girl had studied in 2017-18 said she was a very bright student.

“She was not only good in studies but also in extra-curricular activities, including shooting,” the officer said.

In 2017, the girl had also won a contest by Crossword book store to create a bookmark. The bookmark created by the girl had become the social bookmark of Crossword stores all over the country.

The girl has been a shooter since 2013 and has participated in national rifle shooting events.

This prestigious award was presented to him virtually in the summit that had been organized in partnership with the Union ministry of jal shakti. The function was presided over by secretary, ministry of jal shakti, UP Singh.

Arpit Gupta of the organizers’ team said Khare had been selected for the award under the “Rejuvenating water bodies; innovation in city landscape” for his efforts in transforming a huge waterlogged stinking litter dump full of water hyacinth into a picnic spot and a fresh water reservoir in Hardoi city although the area fell under the village panchayat of Behta Chand in revenue records.

“It is hard to believe that such a hazardous place can exist in the middle of the city -- being a potential breeding point for contagious diseases and a source for groundwater contamination as well as pollution,"" said Khare.

He said the project involved a total investment of Rs 23 lakh, including the allocation of Rs 15 lakh by the finance commission and Rs 8 lakh by MNREGA. It generated 4,000 man-days for the local labourers.

The transformation of the 14,570 square meter area with a depth of 2 meters was completed in eight months -- between February and September, 2019. All initiatives had been taken at the local level, including the designing of the layout, that was been carried out by the Rural Engineering Department, Khare concluded.

While international passengers in 2020-21 (April to March) are expected to be 33 lakh — down 82% from 1.7 crore in the previous fiscal, the domestic count is likely to hover around 1.5 crore — a fall of 70% from almost 5 crore in 2019-20.

Even after the restrictions have been eased from May 25, DIAL said “the demand as seen in the recent past has been highly muted. The plight of international flights is not known”.With constraints on disposable income, “it may also be perused that the spend on travel would be much less even after the lifting of restrictions on air travel. The intensity and duration of impact of Covid-19 on the travel industry is predicted to be far deeper and longer”, the operator pointed out.All scheduled flights were suspended in the last week of March in India.

The notice also warns that if she failed to respond or satisfactorily explain her stand, the allotment would stand cancelled and LMC will take possession of the house. Nikhat is a retired government teacher and a member of Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar Trust, which runs Azam's varsity and schools.

The civic body had allotted the 6,000sq ft bungalow to Alfaq in March 2007 at Rs 1,000 per month when Mulayam Singh Yadav was chief minister.

Municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said, the inquiry was done on directions of the state government, which recently received a complaint against Nikhat. “As per housing rules, if a unit has been allotted to someone she/he needs to reside in the house. In this case, the allottee has not visited the property even once in 10 years,” he added.

Azam Khan, a Samajwadi Party heavyweight, has been a nine-time MLA from Rampur, before being elected to the Lok Sabha in 2019.

Currently, he is in Sitapur jail along with his legislator wife, Tazeen Fatima , and son Abdullah Azam Khan , after being arrested in a forgery case related to the latter’s age proof.

280,['30/08/2020'],Covid +ve report now ‘licence’ to get pvt hospital admission,"Nagpur: A Covid positive test report has literally become the licence to get a private hospital admission in city. Yet, that too alone wouldn’t guarantee a patient of an oxygenated or ICU bed.

Beside a positive report, the patient has to be mild to moderate symptomatic. In case the condition is serious there is no option but to either head to a private hospital outside city limits or knocking the doors of a government medical college where admission is not an issue but necessary facility may not be instantly available.

On Friday evening, a West Nagpur lawyer had to admit his father in a private dedicated Covid hospital (DCH) in Kamptee after seven private hospitals and two trust-run hospitals laid several conditions before them. The Kamptee DCH agreed on Rs30,000 per day cost.

The elderly man, suffering from pneumonia, tested negative in rapid antigen test at NMC’s Raj Nagar centre. His SPO2 level significantly dropped to below the required 95 and needed an oxygen bed immediately. But since he was Covid negative and his condition likely to become serious, none of the private hospitals gave admission. The timely admission proved useful and the man’s blood oxygen level recovered to normal level within 24 hours. Yet, the family is worried about footing the final hospital bill though the administration has claimed over 1,600 oxygenated beds in city.

On Saturday, another breathless man from South-West Nagpur was refused admission even at medical colleges and had to be admitted after depositing Rs2lakh upfront fee.

The situation is no less better for serious Covid patients. As per NMC’s Saturday morning record, just one trust hospitals and three private hospitals had beds, with the conditions applied tag. When TOI spoke to these hospitals, all laid the two main condition that before asking about the patient — the patient must not need ICU and shouldn’t be critical beside a compulsory Covid positive report.

Going by this, it seems people developing any serious health complication and not found positive, may not get a bed anywhere in Nagpur, a medical hub.

Additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma said no patient must be denied admission. “We are aware there is shortage of beds. We are trying to increase the overall bed capacity. But patients must not wait till they reach the stage that they need a ventilator. They must get tested even at slightest indication of Covid-like symptom,” he said.

Regarding NMC-run hospitals, Sharma said, “We are working on making them functional. Some of them already started.”

IGGMCH deputy medical superintendent Dr Sagar Pandey said for safety of our non-Covid staff, critical patients with respiratory infection and even others are initially kept in triage ward. “We are admitting all patients,” he said.

GMCH officials said they have observed certain private hospitals are referring all critical patients now to them. “Private hospitals are just sending all patients here. They must admit non-Covid too,” they said.

TOI had reported that the private hospitals had been raising the issue of non-Covid while resisting the civic body’s move to treat Covid patients there. The private hospitals had been saying that non-Covid illness could be equally dangerous and they won’t be able to manage both types of patients at same time.

A senior medical official of the Sinnar rural hospital said the shortage of doctors, nurses and other employees was being felt across the district, and even several other parts of the state. However, all out efforts are being made by the available staff at the DCHC to provide good treatment to the admitted patients.

The officer said the Sinnar Rural hospital has a Covid care centre (CCC) as well as a dedicated Covid health centre. “Given the rising number of cases in the Sinnar taluka, there is a continuous stream of Covid patients at the facilities. At any given time, all the 90 beds at the CCC are occupied. Thus, it is a tough task for the medical staff, including doctors, nurses and others, to pay equal attention to everyone. Nonetheless, they are doing their best,” the officer said.

He added that they were paying more attention to patients who were admitted in the DCHC.

“We have brought the matter of staff shortage to the senior officials’ attention. The walk-in-interview of candidates for the posts of MBBS doctors, BAMS doctors and nurses is underway at the district level. Once the posts are filled, we would get the required number doctors and paramedical staff,” said the officer who did not want to give his name.

PUNE: A few days from now, Ganapati festival will draw to a close but the myriad colours, sights and vivid images of the celebration will come alive once again, courtesy a photography exhibition called Bappagraphy .

“We thought of holding an exhibition of photographs clicked during the festival so that people can relive the precious moments once again through the photos ,” said Kushal Khot , the organizer of the event, which has been taking place for the past eight years. The exhibition would be held online this year due to Covid-induced restrictions.

Photographers@Pune, a community of shutterbugs, too would showcase photos of previous years’ Ganapati festival on their Facebook page. “All the members will meet online and share old memories of the festival,” said Soumitra Inamdar, a founding member of the group.

In view of the restrictions on celebrations imposed by the authorities, the Bappagraphy team has decided to accept photos of previous years too. “The competition would be judged on three aspects — ‘Ganpati idol’, ‘moods, expressions and emotions of the festival’ and ‘Bappa story’,” said Khot.

The Bappagraphy competition attracts around 500-600 entries every year, many of them from Australia, the US and the UK. Only the best 300 photos are exhibited. Photographer Milind Dhere, who has been associated with the event for several years, said, “Though Bappagraphy involves street photography, there will be more indoor photos this year due to the restrictions on public celebration.”

The two became friends, and the juvenile and an associate would steal mobile phones and give it to Sharma to sell it on a reseller e-commerce website.

The cops said that Sharma also sold the phone of a constable that was stolen from Malviya Nagar. They are also probing the reseller portal after it came to fore that the site doesn’t take any bills and buys phones just by taking down the Aadhaar number and the bank account details.

“If the online platform is not taking any bill, then it gets easy for anyone to sell stolen mobile phones. In March, the mobile phone of a constable who worked as a driver with Delhi Police was snatched by two men on a black motorcycle in Malviya Nagar. Sharma had so far taken four mobile phones from the juvenile, deleted their data and sold them online,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, DCP, south.

As further surveys are under way, a major damage is expected to soybean and pulses like tur, moong and urad. There are chances of a further damage to the soybean crop if the cloudy weather continues. Soybean is the second major crop of the region.

The state’s agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse is touring the areas to assess the losses. Cotton and paddy crops are reported to be safe at this stage, said officials in the agriculture department.

In Nagpur division, 70,000 to 75000 hectares of area under soybean is expected to have been hit. The Nagpur division covers the eastern Vidarbha districts of Nagpur, Wardha, Chandrapur, Gondia, Bhandara and Gadchiroli.

The damage has been reported in Nagpur, Wardha and Chandrapur. A detailed survey to assess the losses has been ordered, said the agriculture department official, who also clarified that no damage was reported on paddy which is a major crop in eastern Vidarbha.

In Amravati division, which covers western Vidarbha’s districts, land under pulses like moong and urad have been affected. “Even as district-wise figures are yet to be compiled, in Amravati and Akola districts clubbed, the damage is expected to have occurred in more than 20,000 hectares,” said a senior official in the department. There has been no damage in Yavatmal district, the source said.

Moong and urad are cultivated in an area of 3 lakh and 4 lakh hectares respectively in the division. However, the farmers may face a bigger crisis if the overcast condition continues as it may affect the soybean crop which is spread in 14 lakh hectares of the division, said an official.

Farmers in Buldhana and Washim contacted by TOI claimed of a major loss not only in the pulses but also soybean.

The crop insurance penetration has gone down by 22% in the region this year. The drop has happened after government did away with the mandatory clubbing of insurance with crop loans.

S Sakthi, a native of Mathirimangalam, was killed after a country-made cracker went off at Mullukudi village on June 27.

Pandhanallur police inspector K Suguna said on Saturday that a country-made serial cracker was fired during the procession. Instead of keeping the cracker in the right position, an 18-year-old boy kept it as a bunch and fired it.

The cracker burst indiscriminately hitting Sakthi and another boy N Praveen, 6 , in the crowd.

Sakthi was injured on the right chest while Praveen sustained injuries on his stomach. Both of them were rushed to the government medical college hospital in Thanjavur. Sakthi died at the hospital a few hours later. Praveen was out of danger and is undergoing treatment.

“As the cracker injured the boy after hitting a wall, and he sustained injury on some other parts. Had it hit him directly, he would have suffered more burn injuries,” inspector Suguna said.

A delegation of traders and leaders from different parties met chief executive officer of CBD Ajay Kumar to discuss the issue.

The garbage tax for general citizens has been increased from Rs 200 to Rs 400 while for traders it has been raised from from Rs 600 to Rs 1,200.

District vice president of NCP Ratan Chawla said that the hike levied on CBD residents was unjust. Five years back, the CBD had levied garbage tax. At the time, there was huge opposition from all quarters of Deolali Camp; however, the tax was eventually levied on people.

This time around when businesses are down and unemployment is increasing by the day owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the CBD has raised garbage tax.

Chawla said that political leaders across party lines came together to protest against the recent hike in the garbage tax.

The delegation led by MLA Saroj Ahire and Ratan Chawla met CEO Ajay Kumar and asked him to roll back the hike taking into account the sentiments of citizens and traders.

Chavla said that while they were protesting against the hike, they wanted the entire garbage tax to be revoked.

PUNE: Students appearing for the online National Aptitude Test in Architecture ( NATA 2020 ) on Saturday complained of various technical issues that affected their performance.

The students said the questions were getting skipped automatically without giving the candidates a chance to answer them, the “save and next” tab was not functioning properly and the question paper got submitted automatically even though there was plenty of time left till the completion of the exam .

NATA 2020 is a qualifying aptitude test for admission to the Bachelor in Architecture degree programme, which is conducted by the Council of Architecture (CoA) from 2006.

Sanika Dahiwal, a student who appeared for the examination from the Ambegaon test centre in Pune, said, “Each question was allotted a certain amount of time, but there was no timer. I attempted the fourth question, but before I could submit it the time was up and the software skipped two questions and took me directly to the seventh question. It showed that I had skipped the fifth question and attempted the sixth one, which I hadn’t. There were students in my class who realized the total time period of the examination was wrongfully shown on the screen as a shorter duration and the moment that ended the paper was automatically submitted.”

Another student Abinav Lonkar said NATA had disabled the option of going back to the previous question. “Part I of the exam had just 10 questions, but each one was of 10 or 16 marks each. When I was attempting the paper the software skipped five out of the 10 questions on its own, leaving me with just five questions which I answered. But, this would mean my score would be very low,” he said.

Social media platforms were also abuzz with students from across the country complaining about problems they faced during the examination. The CoA had given students the option to either attempt the questions from home or go to an exam centre. The CoA organizes NATA twice and the second attempt will be on September 12, for which the registrations are open till September 4.

Habeeb Khan, president of Council of Architecture said, “We have received complaints from students regarding technical issues in the exam. We will investigate the same. We will not let the students suffer because of technical issues, if any.”

Police personnel at the Sinnar Phata police station, while admitting the road has become slippery, said people do not come to them if the accidents are minor.

However, too many minor accidents occur due to the slippery road. The shopkeepers along the highway complained that every time when it is raining, they see some bikers skidding off the road.

Vivek Adke, a shopkeeper along the highway, said, “We see bikers skidding off the road every year when it is raining. My father too had fallen from his bike a couple of years ago. While the entire Pune highway has been widened till Sinnar and further up to Pune, the stretch of 2.5 km had not been taken up for at least five years. Hence after the structures by the road were removed for road widening, the side shoulders of the road have nothing concrete on them.”

During monsoon, the wet soil on the side shoulders of the road are accumulated on the road due to continuous vehicular traffic and hence the surface become slippery.

Officials of the public works department’s (PWD) highway division said there were some problems in the past like tress on the sides of the roads which had to be removed or transplanted, then two years passed as a petition was filed against cutting the trees and later the contractor said he started facing shortage of funds.

However, officials of the highway division issued a strict notice to the contractor after which he has given the undertaking to complete the work at the earliest. Officials said the contractor has assured to finish the road widening work before March 2021.

By: Anjali Jhangiani

PUNE: With people being more careful about making new purchases owing to pay cuts and uncertainties about jobs, furniture rental has emerged as the most preferred option, especially for those working from home .

Malini Nair, an IT professional, set up a workstation with a rented desk and swivel chair so that she can have an ‘office feel’. “My husband and I live in a 1 BHK flat. Working from home is not easy and, therefore, it is important to have some form and structure. Renting furniture is the best option in the current scenario,” she said.

There are some who view work from home as a temporary arrangement and, therefore, are loath to spending a considerable sum on furniture purchase. “Though I am currently working from home, I might be able to return to office in a few months. I managed to work on my coffee table for the first two months and then decided I needed something more comfortable for work, but not a permanent one,” said Nitin Arora, a Katraj resident.

Rentals for computer / laptop tables, chairs, etc have picked up in the last few months. “The advantage of rented furniture is that you don’t have to invest a lumpsum. Due to the growing demand for work-from-home furniture, we have launched a whole new category on our website. Customers can choose from a variety of table and chair options,” said a customer relationship manager of a pan-India furniture rental company. “Our sales have gone up by 40% in Pune,” he said.

“About 30% of our customers, who have rented home furniture from us, are now ordering computer tables and chairs with back support. We also have many new customers who have rented workstation combination of products, including storage for charging cables. Tables with hydraulic system, which enables you to sit or stand while working, are bestsellers,” said a city manager of another rental company.

The growing demand for work-from-home furniture has inspired many start-ups to come up with innovative designs. “We are into design solution. When the lockdown was announced, we thought of coming up with product designs. We have 9 designs so far which have done very well,” said the marketing executive of a start-up.

“I have ordered a trolley table which can be pushed anywhere. Its top can be lifted and tilted to match the eye level while working on a laptop,” said Sree Adhikari, a teacher from Kondhwa.

295,['30/08/2020'],Pay Rs1k/day fine or implement our order: HC to collector,"Nagpur: Expressing displeasure over non-implementation of its orders on transfer of liquor license, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Friday warned the city collector to pay Rs1,000 per day cost till its directives are complied with.

The court on July 30 had granted a stay on the collector’s decision to cancel the transfer of a liquor licence. Justice Ravi Deshpande directed the collector to implement its July 30 orders of interim stay without prejudice to rights and contentions.

The directives came while hearing a case of one Keshav Mohane through counsels SG Jagtap and Sayajee challenging the collector’s order to cancel shifting of CL-III license from Itwari to Beltarodi.

The license was issued to one Gyandeorao Tidke who was running his liquor shop from a rented premises at Gandhi Statue, Itwari, which was transferred to his four sons after his death on October 1, 2007. But the heirs had to shift the shop after its landlord issued notices to vacate the premises. But they sold the licence to petitioner Keshav Mohane before shifting the shop from Itwari to Datta Nagar at Beltarodi and applied for transfer of their license which was allowed by the collector with due process of law.

Petitioner Mohane also paid privilege fees (four times of license fees) of Rs1.85 lakh for the purpose. But the collector on February 10 cancelled the order of shifting without granting any notice or hearing to the petitioner or original licensees, which was challenged.

On July 30, Justice Manish Pitale granted a stay on the collector's decision, but he allegedly failed to comply with it.

296,['30/08/2020'],Trichy residents slam laying of road without milling,"Trichy: While Trichy corporation has taken up road work in the city, residents are opposing its technique as instead of removing the existing layer, the civic body is laying a fresh one over it making houses and other establishments on either side of the roads falling in low-lying area vulnerable to inundation.

Workers in the Ariyamangalam zone have been laying roads in Dharmanadhapuram and Arulanandhapuram in Palakkarai in the past few days. Paver machines are being used to relay the roads utilizing the Tamil Nadu urban road infrastructure fund (TURIF).

Since the heights of the residential roads in Palakkarai will increase due to the addition of fresh layers, residents said the old houses situated alongside the road have become a low-lying area. As the roads either have a faulty stormwater drain or none, even a moderate rain will be a nuisance as the rain water will flow into the houses, they said. “Officials are ignoring the plight of the people. The ensuing monsoon will certainly inundate our locality,” I Augustine, a resident of Annai Nagar, said.

According to the guidelines of Indian Roads Congress (IRC), the surface of the existing road should be milled to ensure better bonding between the new and existing roads. “We are taking up only restoration work, there is no scope for removing the existing road surface in such work,” an official with the corporation’s engineering department said. Residents said they are planning to take up the issue legally for achieving a permanent solution.

This time around, a five-month old pregnant woman delivered a baby boy weighing just 600 grams. According to Dr Joshi, the baby was born as a twin. The other twin died at the time of delivery. The Uikey couple from Pandharkawda had no children since their marriage seven years ago. Pratibha was admitted to the maternity hospital of Dr Rajani Kamble where she gave birth. Dr Ravi Patil performed the preparatory care for the child and the mother.

The new born was shifted to Chirayu Critical Care Centre on June 1. It was a Herculean task for the team. The determined doctors and their nursing staff didn’t lose heart. The baby was put on ventilator for more than two weeks. Since its lungs were not grown enough to breathe, it faced respiratory issues.

“We put the baby on various equipment and also administered a number of drugs to ensure that it got a new lease of life,” he said. The baby was in the hospital for three months and we monitored its growth 24X7 and finally, we succeeded,” he added.

The child now weighs 1800gm and is hale and hearty, said Dr Swapnil Mankar, adding it was discharged on Friday.

Expressing her gratitude, Pratibha said, “We are so happy that we got our child, something we never expected. Joshi Sir and his team saved our child and we don’t know how to thank them.” Last December, Joshi and his team were successful in bringing a baby girl weighing 500gm to life.

Similarly, the number of positive cases in three out of the four zones have come down below 100 for the first time in 48 days.

HYDERABAD: With over 20 leaders, including former ministers and ex-MPs, hoping to get a nomination for the legislative council (upper house) in the state, the race for three MLC seats is hotting up.

TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is expected to finalise nominations for the three MLC vacancies, under the governor quota, before the assembly session begins on September 7.

Terms of MLCs Ramulu Naik, Nayani Narsimha Reddy and Karne Prabhakar had ended in March, June and August respectively. Ramulu Naik was disqualified for switching loyalties to Congress just before the assembly elections in December 2018.

TRS sources said KCR is likely to renominate party whip and spokesperson Karna Prabhakar for the second time. Former home minister Nayani Narsimha Reddy is also seeking renomination, but his age might go against him. In that case, he may seek an MLC berth for his relative. KCR is reportedly considering his OSD Desapathi Srinivas for the upper house in the state.

Marri Rajasekhar Reddy, Malkajgiri TRS incharge and son-in-law of labour minister Ch Malla Reddy, is hoping for an opportunity too. He had contested from the Malkajgiri Lok Sabha constituency in 2019 and lost to Revanth Reddy. Former minister Jupally Krishna Rao, who lost in the previous assembly elections, has also thrown his hat in the ring.

Sources said former Khammam MP Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy, who did not get a ticket to contest in the 2019 LS elections, is also being considered for one of the three MLC seat. Similarly, former Mahbubabad MP Sitaram Naik, who too did not get a ticket in the LS polls, is asking for nomination to the council.

From Warangal, Takalapally Ravinder Rao, who is with the party’s since its inception, former Telangana Beverages Corporation chairman Devi Prasad and others are in the race for the MLC seat under the governor quota..

Kejriwal had recently urged the Centre to allow metro operations to resume, albeit in a graded manner.Your ride, however, won’t be the same anymore.DMRC sources said it was likely that, initially, only government and PSU employees, or those engaged in essential services, would be allowed during the peak hours. Train operation timings may also be curtailed. According to sources, DMRC and other metro operators in the country have been asked to discuss an SOP earlier provided by MoHUA in a video conference on Tuesday.The number of commuters in trains will be slashed to ensure social distancing, which is going to be the prime focus of DMRC and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). Trains will also stop for longer durations at platforms to ensure that the passengers can maintain social distancing while boarding and de-boarding. This will result in longer travel durations.Only one entrance at most of the 242 stations will be kept open, keeping in mind which entry point sees the highest rush. Extensive “filtration” of commuters through thermal scanning and regulation to avoid crowding inside the station will be carried out, both at the entrance and inside.A DMRC official said that the reopening would be challenging and there would be teething troubles. Along with enforcement, DMRC will also carry out an extensive “sensitisation” campaign for the commuters to encourage self-regulation. It has deputed 487 officers on special duty on two shifts at all stations just to keep a check on social distancing. In case of any major defiance of norms, entry to stations will be closed and a train may have to be halted too.A senior CISF official said that extra personnel might be used in the CCTV control rooms to keep a tab on people not maintaining social distancing, or not wearing masks on the station premises. In addition to keeping a check on security, CISF’s quick-reaction teams (QRTs) are also likely to travel in the metro to enforce the norms, he said.“We are still awaiting the exact guidelines, but CISF is prepared to enforce them and we have been preparing for this for the last few months. The CCTV room will be alerting teams on the ground about people who are not wearing masks or disobeying rules. Our teams travelled in the metro earlier too, but now their focus will be more on ensuring that the new guidelines are followed,” said the official.

NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) has started a fresh survey to finalise the locations to install 800 CCTV cameras in the city.

So far, the corporation has installed 27 cameras at two major junctions.

NMSCDCL officials said they will start installing the new cameras once the locations are finalised. They are expected to start the actual installation work in the second half of September.

“Of the 800 new CCTV cameras, 380 will be installed at 40 traffic signals, while the others will be installed at sensitive locations,” said a Smart city official.

“We are taking measures for public security under the smart city projects and all surveillance systems will be integrated and monitored through the command and control centre,” added an official.

“We have already installed 27 cameras at two signals on the first Smart road in the city – Central Bus Stand and Meher point,” he said.

“Earlier, we had identified locations to install the cameras, but the police wanted to conduct a fresh survey and reidentify locations. We have started finalising the spots as per the requirement of the police,” said an official.

“The CCTV cameras will help control robberies, terrorist activities and agitations,” said an official.

Traffic rule violations will be detected online and fines will also be slapped online.

NEW DELHI: With the Centre allowing further relaxations under Unlock 4.0, the capital is likely to see resumption of more economic activities. While Delhi Metro may be back on track soon, post-September 21 Delhiites may be able to invite 100 people to a wedding or a social function and open-air theatres may welcome people with strict implementation of the Covid guidelines.

The number of people allowed to attend a wedding or a funeral is currently capped at 50 and 20, respectively. The limitation of 50 guests is taking a toll on the financial health of banquet halls. Their owners recently called upon CM Arvind Kejriwal to demand an increase in the number of guests. Delhi government is likely to push for increasing guest numbers to 100 in all social functions, said a source.

The central government’s announcement has made owners of gyms and yoga centres hopeful. These facilities, closed since the coronoavirus lockdown has been announced in March, haven’t been allowed under Unlock 3.0 in the capital despite the Centre’s approval for opening them all across the country. The owners have been protesting across Delhi for their opening.

Delhi government is in favour of allowing all economic activities while following safety norms so that more livelihood options are available and the government gets more revenue for funding its welfare and development projects.

However, more activities can be allowed in the capital only after Delhi Disaster Management Authority approves them for the city. Under Unlock 3.0, DDMA , which is chaired by LG Anil Baijal, did not permit gyms and yoga centres to reopen.

Under Unlock 4.0, schools, colleges and educational institutes, cinema halls, swimming pools, entertainment parks and theatres will remain closed. No relaxation will be permitted in the 803 containment zones in the city till September 30.

However, the matter was discussed openly for the first time on Saturday when the elected representatives of the civic body met in the general board online meeting on Thursday. Opposition Congress members alleged that numbers were much higher than stated.

Former opposition leader and Congress corporator Chirag Zaveri pointed out that there were reports of more than 400 positive cases in the city. He said that nearly eight cases were being reported in each urban health centre (UHC) of the city.

Zaveri claimed he himself gathered the details from around eight UHCs in the city.

“Five to six persons were testing positive in rapid testing in each centre. There are 34 such UHCs in the city. More testing is done by Dhanvantari Raths, government and private hospitals. One can only imagine the real situation, ” he said.

Zaveri added the example of his neighbour. “He (neighbour) tested positive of coronavirus and I knew about it as he stays near my house. But it was included in the VMC list only after a couple of days. I was able to get details of patients in my area through sources, but his name did not figure immediately” he alleged.

VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that in stray cases, names were included a day or two late in the lists as details take time in compilation.

“The patient is informed as soon as the result comes so that he can take precautionary steps. Sometimes, results are also conveyed to the wrong health officer and these are included later in the lists,” Patel explained, while refuting allegations of under-reporting of data.

309,['30/08/2020'],Demand for online exams rises,"Nagpur: A day after the Supreme Court’s judgment on final year examinations, reactions continue to pour in from students and academics who are now demanding provision of online options by the universities to prevent them from getting infected.

According to them, it would help even the outstation students and those in containment areas to appear for exams without any fear and hassles. They also demanded deferring the exams till October so that the effects of the virus get reduced by that time and it would be safe to appear in exams.

Former NU management Council member Sanjay Khadakkar, who is now Academic Council member of Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University (YCMOU), reiterated that states should at least now explore the online option of conducting exams that he had suggested to chancellor BS Koshiyari initially.

“The value of a degree gets compromised if students are promoted without exams. It’s a populist and convenient option, but students would face an uncertain future.”

Students like Aniket Joshi feel that if autonomous colleges in the city can conduct online exams, why can’t universities do it? “Of course there would be problems, particularly in rural areas, but Covid-19 spread isn’t alarming there like in cities. The government should make arrangements at such places, but they must insist on online options. It will help not only for the current situation, but also for the future.”

Agreeing with him, electrical engineering student Karuna Tawade said online exam will be the best option as it would save them from the risk of getting contracted from the virus and also ensuring that students would get degrees only after clearing papers.

Om Paradkar from Hislop College said the apex court’s decision would ensure that students wouldn’t be promoted without exams, which is crucial for gauging their quality.

Electronics engineering student Siddarth Meshram said the authorities should now start preparations with full precautions. Both the students hailed the verdict and demanded that the exam timetable should be declared soon so that they could start preparations at earliest.

Some students are still sceptical about the apex court’s decision. “I think for non-professional courses like BA, BSc, and BCom, a little flexibility can be given and it should be left to students if they want to appear in papers or not,” BCom student from Centre Point College Shantanu Sathe said.

PUNE: The state home department has given administrative approval to the Pune rural police to set up sub-district headquarters at Brmahanpur village in Baramati tehsil.

The move is aimed at maintaining law and order in southern part of Pune district.

The home department issued an order to this effect on Friday. The rural police had submitted a proposal in this regard a decade ago.

Sandeep Patil, superintendent of police, told TOI, “It is a crucial development for the district. We will be able to handle law and order situation effectively once the new facility comes up.”

“Currently, we need at least three to four hours to move State Reserve Police Force and the riot control team to Baramati and Indapur tehsil in case of an emergency. The new sub-headquarters will have a dedicated 400-strong police force, including officers, along with necessary equipment. An officer of the rank of additional superintendent of police will be in charge of the headquarters,” Patil added.

Necessary infrastructure, such as drill ground, residential quarters, administrative buildings, and armoury will also be built at the site.

On the night between August 6 and 7, four people, including a couple and their two children aged six and four years, were killed with a sharp weapon by an unidentified person at Wakhari village, in Nandgaon taluka under the Malegaon taluka police station.

The deceased have been identified as Samadhan Chavan (35), his wife Bharatibai (26), son Ganesh (6) and daughter Arohi (4). The incident came to light in the morning when a person from a neighbouring village came to their house, as Chavan had not turned up for a work that had been assigned to him.

The man informed the police patil of the village and subsequently, the police were alerted.

Samadhan Chavan resided on his 2-acre farm on Jeur Road near Wakhari village. Since the house was isolated, nobody knew who committed the crime. Sniffer dogs and forensic teams were pressed into service, but so far, the police have not found any lead.

PI Narendra Bhadane of the Malegaon taluka police station said six teams are working on the case.

On Friday, residents of Wakhari staged an agitation demanding immediate arrest of the killer.

Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Vikram Sali said the traffic police will now stop accepting fine in cash from September 1.

“The decision was taken in view of the rise in Covid cases,” said a senior cop. Several business establishments and individuals aren’t accepting currency notes fearing spread of coronavirus infection. “Traffic cops in city too are at a risk of getting infected while accepting currency notes from violators,” the cop said.

The traffic police had implemented e-challan system ‘One State One Challan’ from February 8, 2019. Under the system, the traffic police had also provided MSwipe devices for accepting fines through debit and credit cards after generating e-challan.

“Still many violators were paying in cash. Now, the traffic police will not accept cash and instead promote online payment options including https://mahatrafficechallan.gov.in, MahaTrafficApp, Paytm and link sent through SMS sent to the mobile numbers of the violators,” said the DCP.

The DCP has appealed to citizens to follow the payment systems to help contain the spread of virus.

319,['30/08/2020'],"Pilibhit man takes paramour, mother of four, on Oz tour on her husband’s passport, probe ordered","Pilibhit: A 36-year-old man from Pilibhit took her paramour — mother of four children — on a tour to Australia on her husband’s passport on January 6. The duo was supposed to return in March but since all international passenger flights to Indian were suspended in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic breakout, they got stranded and returned home on August 24.

Upon their return, the aggrieved husband, Gurdev Singh, 46, a resident of Damgarhi village in Pilibhit district, who works in Mumbai, approached police accusing his wife of having “illicit” relationship with the accused, Sandeep Singh, 36, also a Pilibhit resident, and charging the accused with forging documents to obtain a passport in his name. One of the children of Gurdev studies in Australia.

Taking serious note of the allegations, superintendent of police Jai Prakash Yadav ordered an investigation into the matter by a local intelligence unit (LIU) inspector and registration of an FIR based on Gurdev’s complaint.

According to Gurdev, he has been working in Mumbai for the past 20 years and occasionally visits his wife Kulwant Kaur (43), who lives in a farmhouse and looks after his ancestral land.

Gurdev alleged that Sandeep, a resident of Dandwa Piparia village under Puranpur kotwali, used to address his wife as ‘mausi’ (mother’s sister) to conceal their illicit relationship. “When I returned to Pilibhit on May 18, my wife was not at home. I came to know from Sandeep’s family that both had gone to Australia. To find out whether Sandeep forged documents to obtain a passport in my name showing Kulwant and him as husband-wife to visit Australia, I purposely applied for a passport on August 24 at the Bareilly-based passport office. My suspicion was ascertained by the passport authorities, who told me that a passport in my name was already issued on February 2, 2019,” said Gurdev.

The SP said Gajraula police and LIU inspector Kanchan Rawat would focus their probe on how a passport in the name of Gurdev was issued despite identity-checking at multiple levels.

Earlier, one of the main accused of the Nabha jailbreak case Gurjeet Singh Ladda had also succeeded in obtaining a fake passport in the name of one Surjeet Singh, a resident of Sherpur Makrandpur village under Puranpur kotwali in Pilibhit, four years ago. The matter came to light after Nadda was arrested by the Punjab ATS (Anti-Terrorist Squad) on September 19, 2017, when he was about to fly to Canada on the fake passport.

320,['30/08/2020'],Hyderabad: Thefts at govt hospitals lead to infra decay,"HYDERABAD: Amid the pandemic , the infrastructure of government hospitals has taken a beating, thanks to frequent thefts. Most common items: copper wires from AC connections, bathroom fittings and even wheelchairs.

While copper wires thefts are most common at Gandhi Hospital, almost all bathroom fittings were stolen from Niloufer Hospital ’s outpatient block around six months ago. Osmania General Hospital (OGH), meanwhile, has lost nearly 100 wheelchairs over the last two years. “Sometimes four-five patients, who need a wheelchair, come at the same time. Owing to limited manpower we at times ask the attendants themselves to take the wheelchair. At the time of leaving, they take the wheelchairs along,” said Dr B Nagender, OGH superintendent. While hospital authorities tried to put in place a system of keeping the attendants’ mobile phones in custody, for the time they used the wheelchairs, they often found that just the mobile cases were left behind, after the theft .

If missing wheelchairs have led to a crisis at OGH, theft of fittings have left washrooms at Niloufer unusable. “There is a need to increase security at hospitals but it isn’t a priority for the government. These things are usually done by outsiders but even hospital staff sometime hand in glove with them. It’s basically an administrative failure,” said an insider from the hospital.

While authorities say that they refrain from filing FIRs as these are usually petty thefts, they often have a huge impact on patient care. “Several Covid-19 patients had complained about broken taps and unusable washrooms. The condition continues to be the same even now. FIRs are not filed also because because it is very difficult to nab offenders as there are very few security personnel or CCTV cameras in the hospital,” said a senior doctor at Gandhi Hospital.

The BJP-led Adhyatmik Aghadi organised a ‘Ghanta Naad’ agitation outside temples across many places demanding that the state government must throw open the doors of temples for people who wish to seek mental solace during the Covid-19 pandemic.

“We are agitating in Nashik city which is a known pilgrimage place across the country and abroad. We demand that the state government should open up the doors of temples, gurdwaras, Jain sthanaks and Buddha vihars at the earliest. It is people’s faith in God and the temples and the government should stay out of it,” Tushar Bhosale, who was heading the Aadhyatmik Azadi, said.

The primary program was held at Ram Kund in Nashik after which the devotees, party functionaries and local priests climbed up the stairs of Kapaleshwar temple where they staged a protest asking government to re-open the doors of temples.

“We have liquor shops operating normally across the state but wonder why the government is not allowing temples to open up?,” questioned BJP regional secretary MLA Devyani Pharande.

Similar agitation was carried out at Trimbakeshwar, Saptshringi Gadh and Shirdi (Ahmednagar district) as well.

Meanwhile, the BJP unit of Aurangabad city organised a ‘Ghanta Naad’ protest similar to the Nashik one on Saturday morning demanding opening of temples.

A couple of days ago, Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel had demanded opening of temples from September 1 followed by opening of mosques and other religious places from September 2 in the state.

Imtiaz, who is also the state president of Hyderabad-based party AIMIM, has been demanding opening of religious places belonging to all the communities for almost a month now. However, he took a hard stand and warned of publicly offering prayers if the state government does not announce opening of religious places.

He told TOI, “When the state has already allowed opening of markets, marriage halls and other places, there is no sense in keeping all the religious places closed.”

Reiterating his demand of allowing religious places to open, he said, “If permission is not granted, then we will have to open all the religious places, ourselves.”

The HC made the comment while hearing a plea on tender conditions for ground handling operations in regional airports . The petitioners had challanged the change in eligibility criteria to participate in the bid. The HC said it is “pained” that on one hand the government talks of ‘Make in India’ and on the other hand floats tenders which would result in ouster of small entities.

It was hearing a plea relating to tender conditions for ground handling operations in regional airports. “What really irks is that if you really want to oust these people (small entities), then say so. Don’t be hypocritical in your speeches. Your political leadership speaks of Make in India, they speak of ‘ Atmanirbhar Bharat ’, they speak about encouraging local industry, but your actions don’t match your words. You are being completely hypocritical,” the court remarked.

It asked additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain, appearing for the Centre and Airport Authority of India , to seek instructions and get clarity on the issue. “We are saying stop importing from this country or that country and on the other hand we are also failing our own entrepreneurs,” HC added, referring to the tender eligibility criteria that wants an annual turnover of over Rs 35 crore and experience of having worked with scheduled airlines.

“You want big players with big pocket, and maybe foreign tie-ups, to come in” HC said, pointing out that the smaller players would have worked at regional airports where flights of scheduled airlines are few or not at all.

The Chandor-based entertainer had regaled audiences in India and abroad over the years and had packed weekly schedules at several hotels and restaurants as a one-man band. But none of that could keep his family afloat after the Covid-19 outbreak and consequent lockdown brought tourism and allied sectors to naught.So, he began selling fish. In fact, over the past couple of months, Antao has expanded his services to deliver seafood to one’s doorstep anywhere in the state.“My life has changed and so has the perception of some of my colleagues. For instance, when I went to deliver fish to an acquaintance, I was asked why I hadn’t opted for any other kind of work. I told him that if he could give me a job that could pay my loans, I’d gladly work for him,” Antao said.Desperation and a weak economy forced the entertainer to make some tough decisions. He sold his limited-edition SUV at half the price to save his house from foreclosure and removed his children from an unaided school as he could no longer pay their fees. “If this situation continues for a year, I might even have to sell my house,” Antao rued. “Full-time musicians now have no source of income at all.”That the pandemic has been particularly cruel to Goa’s once thriving entertainment industry is evident. Up north in Nagoa, Bardez, Jude Davitoria – a solo artiste and events coordinator – found himself grappling with a fate similar to Antao’s. Unable to pay the EMI on his car loan in May, ‘Country Jude’ had to sell his vehicle for a song along with some music equipment that he had purchased for his teenaged son. It didn’t help that his teacher wife hadn’t been receiving her salary either.With their backs to the wall, the couple decided to convert their passion for cooking into an occupation . Today, they prepare and deliver a range of Goan masalas and pastes, pickles, curries, pulao and even an entire fish thali to most parts of the state. Their son chips in too and makes a delectable Goan caramel pudding.“What has happened over the past few months is a good lesson for all us musicians, especially those who’ve relied on the industry as the sole source of income. My parents always told me to have another trade in hand because tourism is not eternal. I now fully understand the significance of that advice,” Davitoria said.The path ahead is uncertain but the nascent cook has no plans of slowing down. Just recently, he introduced ready-to-fry beef croquettes and fish cutlets. “The profit margins are not high, but I am glad that I am at least able to pay my bills,” Davitoria said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77830268,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-34872,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-pandemic-cripples-goan-gig-industry-musicians-change-tempo-to-survive/articleshow/77829042.cms

NASHIK: The Nashik municipal corporation (NMC) has appealed to people to use ammonium bicarbonate for household immersion of Ganesh idols .

People have been requested to take the chemical from the NMC’s divisional offices free of charge for eco-friendly Ganesh immersion . Residents may place their demand for ammonium bicarbonate online through NMC’s portal or they may directly approach divisional offices of the civic body.

The civic body has distributed 4.5 tonne ammonium bicarbonate free of charge so far to over 1,000 residents for immersion of Ganesh idols at the household level.

Moreover, the civic body has also collected over 2,500 Ganesh idols donated to them at their specified immersion spots across all six divisions. These donated idols will be immersed by the civic body to avoid large crowd of people at one place.

Ammonium bicarbonate is mixed with water in a bucket, following which idols are imeersed into it and kept for about 48 hours. Once the idol is completely dissolved, the remains can be used as manure or soil conditioner for garden areas.

326,['30/08/2020'],Delhi Containment Zones: 216 in nine days; Sealed zones touch high of 803 in Delhi,"NEW DELHI: The spike in Covid cases has seen the number of containment zones in Delhi going up by 216 in the last nine days. This is the sharpest rise in sealed areas in the capital and has taken the total number of red zones to 803 on August 28, the most since the Covid-19 pandemic arrived in the city. In the past three days alone, 109 areas reporting clusters of corona cases have been sealed.The growth of red zones is significant because the number of containment areas saw a dip earlier this month to less than 500 from a high of over 700 towards the end of July. A government official explained that the rise in containment zones was the outcome of the government’s reaction to the increase in Covid cases in recent days.“The district authorities are quickly converting into containment zones those locations reporting multiple cases from a certain apartment, street or a housing block. Sealing off such areas is an effective way of checking the spread of the coronavirus,” said the official.Any locality that reports more than three Covid-positive cases within a small distance of each other is converted into a containment zone. The area is sealed off and full restrictions imposed on movement of people and vehicles there, with the implementation of the strictures overseen by police personnel and civil defence volunteers. Essentials are home delivered to the residents through select service providers under the guidance of the authorities.In the 11 districts, South-West currently has the highest number of 162 active containment zones, followed by West with 113, North 110 and South 102. The fewest containment zones, 22, are in North-East district, while North-West with 29 and New Delhi with 31 are just above it.So far, Delhi has cumulatively sealed 1,694 areas since the Covid outbreak, 321 of them located in South-West district, followed by West with 266 containment zones and North with 223. A total of 891 sealed zones have been reopened .According to a government official, containment zones help by focusing attention of the local authorities on those spots and allowing extensive disinfection, contact tracing and surveillance. Sealing does affect economic activities and people’s lives, but ultimately helps the citizens because the coronavirus is contained to a limited space.A government source confided that one of the reasons behind the rise in the number of containment zones was many members of the same families testing positive. “It has been observed that some people delay going for tests and spread the infection in the family,” the source said. “The CM has appealed to people to opt for testing as soon as they notice Covid symptoms.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77829471,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-337304,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/216-in-nine-days-sealed-zones-touch-high-of-803/articleshow/77828274.cms

NASHIK: The Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) has completed its preparation for the Ganapati immersion as well as Tajiya processions that mark the culmination of Muharram.

The police department and the MMC held meetings with the members of Ganesh mandals and Tajiya committee and reviewed the preparations. They also appealed to the members to ensure that the events were handled in a safe and peaceful manner. This year, given the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, there are not going to be any elaborate Ganesh or Tajiya processions.

Mayor of Malegaon Tahira Shaikh has requested people to adhere to the safety protocols. “Be it Tajiya or Ganeshotsav, people should cooperate with the MMC and police,” Shaikh said.

The members of Tajiya committee pointed out that the number of Tajiyas in Malegaon town this year had been brought down from 450 to 250. “We have clubbed the Tajiyas of multiple groups. Some of them have refused to do so and instead decided to limit their observance to sermons and prayers. We will ensure safe conduct of the programme,” said Shafiq Rana of the Tajiya committee.

Additional superintendent of police Sandeep Ghuge said there would be no processions on any of the days as per state government orders. People have been appealed to immerse their Tajiya at their homes. The same thing applies to Ganapati idols. At most, people may hand over their idols at the nearest collection centre organised by the corporation to avoid rush near the traditional immersion sites.

Corporator and former MLA of Rashid Shaikh also appealed to the people to stay safe and added that the corporation should provide facilities, including clean drinking water, to people on during the two days.

329,['30/08/2020'],Telangana: Experimental garden plans hit land hurdle,"HYDERABAD: With the state government not alloting required land, the plan to set up an experimental garden to conserve the rare, endangered and threatened (RET) plant species in Telangana is yet to take shape.

Senior scientists from the Botanical Survey of India (BSI) under the Union ministry of environment and its Deccan Regional Centre (DRC), Hyderabad are shuttling between the offices of the state chief secretary, chief commissioner of land administration (CCLA) and minister of forests to secure two-acres in the city.

As of now, DRC is functioning from a small office in the Kendriya Sadan at Koti. “We are finding it difficult to conduct plant research from here as this location is very small,” a scientist from BSI told TOI.

“A proposal to allot two-acre land had been mooted way back in 2012. Despite our best efforts nothing has happened so far. We are running from pillar to post and recently met endowments minister Indrakaran Reddy. The minister asked CCLA to pursue the matter,” the scientist said.

“In 2012, the state government said it would allot two-acre land at Attapur. But we were demanded Rs 14.5 crore as the token price although environment ministry’s norms don't permit this. Our scientists here are documenting and conducting research on the flora of three states Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha,” the scientist added. If the state allocates land, DRC plans to utilise 40% of it to construct the administrative building and 60% to conserve the RET plant species in Telangana.

330,['30/08/2020'],"After 114 days for 1st 20 deaths, Goa now sees 20 every 3 days","With 25 deaths in the last 72 hours and the state’s healthcare infrastructure struggling to cope, the spotlight has once again fallen on the government’s inability to arrest the spread of the infection. This comes at a time when health minister Vishwajit Rane said on Friday that all state-run facilities are full.The state, which took 114 days to see its first 20 deaths from the pandemic , now sees 20 fatalities every three days. And with over 500 new positives a day and medical facilities running dry, doctors, healthcare professionals and citizens lThis week, the state’s Covid-19 death rate breached the 1% mark. TOI reported on Saturday that 1 in every hundred persons in Goa has already contracted the virus. While these figures are still below the national average, they’re far higher than other states with commensurate healthcare indicators like Kerala, Manipur, Sikkim, and Meghalaya.“What’s even more appalling than the 1% of the population testing positive is the fact that the mortality rate has crossed 1%. Strategies of quarantining, contact tracing, working from home and social distancing didn’t work,” a Panaji-based private doctor said.Now, as the state instead finds itself in the company of much larger, less developed states, experts are wondering if more could have been done to rein in the death count. At 1.1%, Goa’s fatality rate is on par with Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand. The state’s failure is more baffling given its population is just 15.4 lakh, area smaller than many districts, and has a full-fledged administration of a cabinet and 23 IAS officers.Mortality rate — or case fatality ratio (CFR) — is the number scientists and researchers rely on to ascertain the risk of dying from a disease. Goa’s 1.1% is slowly inching upwards towards the national average (currently 1.8%), which has been on the decline.As on August 29, Goa had 178 fatalities and 16,553 total Covid cases. Jharkhand, with a population of 3.74 crore, has 390 deaths while Haryana, with a population of 2.86 crore, has 670 deaths.In the last one week itself, the number of new infections has grown by an average of 2.7% in Goa. In Haryana, Covid-19 cases have grown by 2.3% every day while in Jharkhand new cases have risen by 3.9% per day.The state government has provided a variety of excuses for the rising numbers. Deaths, for instance, are regularly blamed on comorbidities — a strategy lambasted by everyone including former governor Satya Pal Malik. Rising cases have variously been blamed on people not following rules, and most recently, flouting Ganesh Chaturthi regulations.“Deaths can be prevented, but the only thing is that the patients have to come on time for treatment,"" said GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar. ""Even if there are slight symptoms, then they should come to the hospital. Once the disease advances, nothing can be done.""However, conspicious in the audit of the government’s goofups are the bungling failures by the top tier of the state administration. While the hundreds of new cases everyday point to the fact that contact tracing was a flop, the government’s inability to foresee a possible spike has put lakhs of lives at risk.“When the first Covid hospital was half full they should have begun getting the second hospital ready,” said a Panaji-based doctor. “When it was 80% full the second hospital should have been activated but when the numbers rose the government didn’t scale up. They dragged their feet when they should have gotten their act together and immediately activated new hospitals.”Mismanagement of containment zones, delay in decision making, shortage of healthcare professionals, also played a role in the state being two steps behind the pandemic. Citizens looking for reassurance from the government too were snubbed when its own brass — ministers, legislators and bureaucrats — made a beeline for private hospitals when they caught the infection.Last month, IMA had suggested that Goa needs to have a full-fledged Covid hospital close to GMC, maybe even the super-specialty hospital that has come up, if we want to control the deaths,” said Indian Medical Association – Goa president Dr Samuel Arawattigi.Arawattigi said that the super-specialty block could be utilized for Covid-19 treatment for a year till the pandemic subsides and a vaccine is found.Though many stakeholders refrained from coming on record, conversation among doctors has veered towards the administrative glitches that allowed Covid-19 to spread its tentacles across the state.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77830202,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-286113,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-114-days-for-1st-20-deaths-goa-now-sees-20-every-3-days/articleshow/77829043.cms

332,['30/08/2020'],Delhi: Districts deploy special teams to crack the whip,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Central and North districts on Saturday deployed additional special enforcement teams to ensure that people follow Covid-19 guidelines like social distancing, wearing masks, no spitting in public places and no large gathering.

All districts have been asked to ramp up enforcement in the wake of the recent rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, which have stoked apprehensions that the novel coronavirus infection is spreading again after a sustained dip in July and early August.

Dilkhush Meena, sub-divisional magistrate (kotwali) of Central district, said nine mobile enforcement awareness vehicles were being utilised to create awareness about the Covid-19 guidelines.

“The mobile vans go to different areas, especially marketplaces and localities that are likely to see large gatherings, and spread a message about the Covid-19 guidelines,” said Meena. Some time later, enforcement teams visit these areas and issue challans to all violating the guidelines, he added. Enforcement teams consist of revenue department officials and police personnel.

The number of challans issued in just Central and North districts during the pandemic reveals that thousands of people are violating the norms. In Central, 19,850 challans have been issued across the district, including unauthorised and upscale colonies, and Walled City. The highest number of challans has been issued for not wearing masks and the second highest for not following social distancing.

A few more people have been fined in North district. Among 19,911 challans, the highest number — 16,167 — was for violating the mask rule and the second highest — 2,987 — for not following social distancing. “Ten enforcement teams have been deployed in the district,” said district magistrate Deepak Arjun Shinde.

Across the capital, the authorities have found several people not wearing masks even in public places. Large numbers of people wear them covering the chin or the chin and the mouth, but not the nose.

Experts believe that the dip in cases may have led to a sense of complacency among a section of people that the Covid situation is quite under control. However, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been constantly appealing to Delhiites to stay alert and follow the guidelines to defeat the virus.

A health department official also said that one of the reasons behind the recent rise in the Covid numbers might be the complacency and carelessness among some people. North district has found 20 people violating quarantine rules, which indicates gross carelessness on their part.

334,['30/08/2020'],Photos: Fallen trees turn into park benches in east Delhi,"NEW DELHI: To save time and cost involved in transporting cut branches or fallen trees after heavy rains, East Delhi Municipal Corporation has started using them to create benches and ornamentation pieces in neighbourhood parks.EDMC horticulture director Raghwendra Singh said that the trunk and branches of uprooted trees are auctioned to contractors or sent to crematoriums free of cost. “But both require timely transportation. The contractors eligible to bid for the wood are usually so busy that our employees have to call them repeatedly to come and take the tree parts and allow smooth movement of traffic. Likewise, we need to arrange vehicles to take trees to a crematorium,” Singh said.The idea of using the wood instead for the parks occurred when a gulmohar tree fell on the EDMC headquarters complex a month ago due to heavy rain.“We have rented space in that DSIIDC building , and we needed to consult the building owner before taking any action,” recalled Singh. “When nothing happened even after two days, we toyed with the idea of turning the tree into benches for visitors on the lawn. We shared the idea with the EDMC commissioner, mayor and standing committee chairman on August 14 and they also admired it.”The concept was discussed again when two days later a huge jamun tree fell in Geeta Colony and getting it removed again proved a problem. “These two instances pushed us to find an immediate solution. I discussed the matter with my gardeners, who had worked as carpenters earlier, and they suggested multiple usage for the wood,” said Singh. “I checked such woodwork online and designated a nursery at Vivek Vihar for the collection of fallen trees. We have deployed three-four malis to fabricate usable items from fallen trees.”Branches with big girths make benches and stands, while smaller ones are turned into guards for saplings and plants. Officials said the initiative was not only adding to EDMC’s resources, but also cutting the cost of installing benches in parks.“In the last five years, we have earned Rs 75,000 on the sale of trees and branches. Rather than auctioning them, turning them into products for parks, schools and other places is a better idea,” said an official. “We have the remnants of 25 trees at Vivek Vihar, and our workers are crafting useful items out of them.” EDMC is now considering treating dead trees in a similar manner.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77829523,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-377294,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/resurrection-fallen-trees-turn-into-park-benches-in-east-delhi/articleshow/77828299.cms

He visited the NMC head office on Friday, within few hours of receiving Covid-19 positive report for one of his immediate family members. The corporator, a resident of Central Nagpur, also held a press conference along with one of two top NMC office-bearers and woman corporators at the NMC office.

NMC sources told TOI that the corporator along with his 14 family members had got tested for Covid-19 on Thursday. “Testing was done after doctor of one of the brothers of the corporator had tested positive. At around 11am, corporator received reports of all 15. One of the family members tested positive while remaining, including the corporator, were negative,” said the sources.

On Saturday evening, the corporator took to social media to inform that five more from his family have tested positive.

Earlier, if high-risk contacts of positive patients tested negative the NMC used to send them to 14-day institutional quarantine. Tests were done after completion of 14-day quarantine. Many had tested positive in second tests. After cases started increasing in city, the NMC allowed home quarantine from last week of July.

NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “As per guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research, high-risk contacts are advised to be in 14-day home quarantine if tested negative. With increase in cases and limited staff with NMC, it is not possible to monitor high-risk contacts. Our top priority is testing all high-risk patients,” he said.

According to the corporator, the family member who tested positive was at his sister’s house for the last five days. “I returned home from the NMC and admitted my family member to one of the hospitals. Since then, I along with other family members are in home quarantine. I have even locked my house’s gate so that no one can come inside,” he said.

Sources in NMC said swab samples of 15 family members were collected at a location near the corporator’s house where all including the woman who tested positive were present.

TOI on August 22 had reported about family members of few Covid positive shopkeepers who did not get tested and continued to keep their shops open. One of the positive family members was in shop. Another family member was also in shop when his positive report arrived.

The chief minister’s office (CMO) said that in the month of June, the chief minister had held detailed discussions with the newly appointed advocate general Devidas Pangam for a possible solution. After an in-depth study and comprehensive discussions, it was decided that a two-pronged strategy should be adopted by the state, to file a review petition and also simultaneously pursue a central government amendment to the Goa, Daman and Diu Mining Concessions (Abolition and Declaration as Mining Leases) Act, 1987.

The Centre is considering the Goa government’s suggestion for an amendment to the act, the CMO said.

Stating that the chief minister is committed to the welfare and the well-being of the people affected by the mining ban, the CMO said, “Sawant is continuously monitoring the actions taken by the government towards resumption of mining and related activities.”

As the formal order has not been passed by the Chief Justice of India on the application moved by the state government to tag its review petition along with the special leave petition (SLP) filed by the mining companies, the Supreme Court on Friday adjourned Goa’s crucial mining matter to September 9.

The mining companies had filed a SLP in the apex court after the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed their petitions challenging the Goa, Daman and Diu (Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987.

During the Portuguese rule, the appellants were granted mining concessions, which were then converted into mining leases under the act. The SLP had stated that the act should be made applicable from 1987 instead of 1961.

The state government had also told the SC that the companies had made a representation to the mines department contending that under the amendment to Section 8A of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, they’re entitled to extend their leases to 2037, but that they would abide by the court’s order.

Ravi Shankar, chief conservator of forests, said the accused are not professional smugglers. “Following a tip-off, we kept an eye on their activities for a month, and trapped them by posing as buyers,” he said.

Vishal, one of the accused who lived with his grandmother in Goa, had brought old hippo ivory, including nine teeth, to Karnataka. Before shifting her house some months ago, the grandmother had handed over the hippo ivory to Vishal asking him to sell it.

The ivory and teeth date back to the 1960s. A joint investigation by Karnataka and Goa forest officials revealed that her father had brought the ivory from Tanzania.

After Vishal approached Anil Pansekar in Goa to sell the ivory and teeth, they were transported to Goa-Karnataka border in July, from where the other three accused — Jakir Khan from Chandragutti in Sorab taluk, Muzafar Hassan from Honnavar and Mohammed Danish from Bhatkal — took them to Karnataka.

All through August, the accused tried looking for buyers, and had also approached many. Ivory, teeth and three vehicles have been recovered from them. All of them have booked under the provisions of Wildlife Protection Act (1972).

In Haveri on Saturday, Bommai said that police were taking all necessary steps to crack down on the drug racket, and bring all those involved in the trade of narcotics to book. The home minister’s statements come close on the heels of the seizure of more than 200kg of marijuana in Bengaluru. “We have received information about the possible involvement of foreigners in this illegal business. We will weed out this trade and ensure that all offenders get punished,” he said.

The home minister added that a campaign would be initiated in schools and colleges, once they reopen, to prevent students from getting addicted to drugs . “If we find evidence of drug abuse among students, the institution will be held accountable,” he said.

341,['30/08/2020'],RDA set to demolish Azam’s ‘Humsafar’ resort in Rampur,"RAMPUR: In what could be fresh trouble for Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and Lok Sabha MP Azam Khan , the Rampur Development Authority (RDA) on Saturday issued orders to demolish the “illegally constructed luxurious resort ‘Humsafar’”. The resort, situated on Jauhar University Road in Rampur district, is under the name of his wife Tazeen Fatma.

The RDA has sent a notice again to the jailed Rampur MLA Tazeen and sought her reply within 15 days. There was an “unsatisfactory” reply to the earlier notice, the RDA stated. Azam, his wife and son Abdullah are at present lodged at Sitapur District Jail in cases of forgery and land grab. The trio had surrendered before a local court after being declared “absconders”.

Rampur’s additional district magistrate (ADM) JP Gupta told TOI, ""‘Humsafar’ resort and the site map were not approved by the RDA. A notice has been earlier sent to Tazeen Fatma in 2019. But, she had filed a reply stating that the site map of the ‘Humsafar’ resort was approved by the Zila Panchayat . When a reply was sought from Zila Panchayat officials, they informed that the approval of the map in favour of Fatma's resort had already been cancelled. So, a fresh notice has been sent to Fatma and if she fails to file an appropriate reply within 15 days, the resort will be demolished.”

ADM Gupta, who is also the RDA secretary, further said that a part of the resort has been constructed within the ‘green belt’ area, which is completely illegal.

Earlier in August last year, the Rampur district administration had razed a boundary wall of the resort as it had allegedly encroached upon a 1,000-metre stretch of a drain belonging to the irrigation department.

344,['30/08/2020'],Coronavirus in Telangana: Many under the age of 45 getting infected,"HYDERABAD: Recent reports across the globe indicate that many young people are getting infected by the coronavirus and the latest trend in Telangana is no different. Turns out, several patients under the age of 45 years are landing up at hospitals in the state with mild to severe symptoms, including respiratory distress.Initially, hospital admissions in this age group were less than 10%. But according to the health authorities, hospital admissions have gone up to 30% now. Moreover, about 50%-60% of consultations for mild to severe symptoms at private hospitals, offering Covid-19 treatment, comprise those below 45 years old, say sources. In most of these cases the patients are at an advanced stage by the time they reach the hospital, they add.Experts believe that the people in this age group are seeking medical attention at a later stage, as they do not suffer from co-morbidities, resulting in hospitalisation.At Gandhi Hospital, which admits severe cases, there is a substantial increase in admissions from 2%-3% to around 10% in this category. “The increase has been seen in the last two months. In majority of the cases, they are being diagnosed at a later stage,” said Dr Prabhakar Rao, nodal officer for Covid-19. Admissions at the state-run Chest Hospital have gone up from 10% to 30% in this age group.“Apart from more exposure in the younger lot, there is also a tendency to ignore the symptomatology, as many tend to think that being younger is itself a protection. Also, many are not taking adequate precautions and are turning up with the advancement of the infection and breathlessness,” said Dr Mahaboob Khan, superintendent, Chest Hospital.Meanwhile, going by the overall number of positive cases in this category, there is a slight increase of positive cases in men and women in the 21 to 30 age group.

345,['30/08/2020'],West Bengal: Final-semester exam rule likely next week,"Image used for representational purpose only

KOLKATA: The state higher education officials, after reading the Supreme Court verdict on holding terminal-semester exams, feel some universities in Bengal, which have already published the provisional results for the final semester/year, may have to consider withdrawing them.

A Bikash Bhavan official said vice-chancellors would attend an online meeting with education minister Partha Chatterjee on August 31 at 1pm to discuss the exam rules.

A day after SC gave a verdict that terminal-semester/year exams would have to be conducted this year, but individual states could ask to defer the dates beyond the earlier deadline of September 30 set by UGC, vice-chancellors and other officials of state-run universities were flooded with calls from students, seeking clarification. Some even urged the government to frame a policy soon or inform the students whether they would have to reappear for the exams as the joining dates of their new jobs were ahead.

“A major point of debate is that whether the provisional results published by some universities will be valid or not. After reading the judgment, it seems no university will be allowed to award any weightage to past semester scores. The entire assessment will have to be on the current semester. Only a few universities have conducted exams, with cent percent weightage to the current semester or have assessed students in the manner prescribed in the verdict. But we will have to study the judgment further and analyse,” said the Bikash Bhavan official.

Higher education department officials pointed out universities had assessed terminal-semester students in different ways, based on 50-50, 70-30 or the state government-suggested 80-20 formula, under which a percentage of the weightage was awarded to the best scores from earlier semesters. “We are seekinging legal opinion and examining the judgment in details. The state is likely to take a call next week on exam dates, format and if necessary, a new formula,” the official said. Bikash Bhavan is also examining whether the universities, which had published results based on the 80-20 formula, where the higher weightage was given to the best scores from the past semesters, had to be revoked or modified.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday sent out a message that her government would hold the final-year/semester exams, following the SC order, despite her differences with the Centre over holding exams during the pandemic. But Banerjee announced the exams would not be held in September but in October before the Pujas. “I will tell the education minister to consult the universities and come up with a decision to hold online tests, and offline tests in the neighbourhoods. The decision has to be announced in three days. Exams can’t be held in September. They will be held in October before the Pujas,” the CM had said at a virtual rally on Friday.

346,['30/08/2020'],PM pitches for taking farm education to school level,"PM Modi

JHANSI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday pitched for taking farm education to middle school level to promote agro-entrepreneurship, saying reforms are being made in National Education Policy , 2020. “Efforts are on to introduce agriculture as a subject in school,” said Modi after the virtual inauguration of college and administration buildings of Rani Lakshmi Bai Central Agricultural University , Jhansi.

Asserting that efforts are being made to connect farming with modern technology, the PM noted that research institutions and agricultural universities have a vital role to play, repeating a slogan — Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan.

Reiterating his commitment to development of drought- prone Bundelkhand region, he said, 500 projects of over Rs 10,000 crore have been sanctioned for improving water availability.

“The proposed Ken-Betwa river linking project has the potential to change fortunes of the area and the Centre is in discussion with both Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on this issue,” he said.“When I visited Jhansi before elections, I promised toilets in every house in the first 5 years and water in the next 5 years. We have been successful in both. In the last two months, work on potable water of Rs 3000 crore has begun and soon water will be delivered through pipelines at each house in Bundelkhand,” he said.

Invoking the valour of Bundelkhand and legendary queen Laxmibai, he said, her freedom cry motivated the entire country. “Now there's a need for a new cry from this region and that is ‘My Jhansi, My Bundelkhand’ to help build an Atmanirbhar Bharat,” he said. He appealed to students of agriculture to work in the mode of ‘one-life, one-mission’ and strengthen scientific research, which is the future of the country as it will turn farmers into entrepreneurs and help strengthen the Atamanirbhar mission.

UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Union minister Narendra Tomar were present during the virtual inauguration of the academic building of Rani Laxmibai Central Agricultural University. Around 55,000 people also attended the programme through virtual platform.

Asserting that the farm sector has a major role to play in making India self-reliant, Modi said, “When I talk about 'atmanirbhar' in agriculture, it is not limited to foodgrains, but self-reliance of rural economy.”

Earlier, interacting with students of Rani Lakshmi Bai Central Agricultural University, the Prime Minister expressed concern over the Rs 75,000 crore edible oil import bill and sought solution from students on the issue. He also stressed on the need to boost food processing levels and create awareness among farmers about micro, drip and sprinkler irrigation in the drought-prone Bundelkhand region and other parts of the country.

The PM also stressed on promoting recycling of water and rainwater harvesting through innovative and less costlier technology in the region. He also mentioned that Israel's water technology can be of use.

Rani Lakshmi Bai Central Agricultural University started its first academic session in 2014-15 and is offering both under-graduate and post-graduate courses in agriculture, horticulture and forestry. It is currently operating from the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute, Jhansi, as the main buildings were getting ready.

348,['30/08/2020'],"In last lap, focus only on strong points: Experts","Nagpur: With just two days remaining for JEE (main) exams to begin, experts are advising candidates to focus only on their strong points. Since JEE is a computer-based test, it is held twice daily. The exams are scheduled from September 1 to 6.

Ashutosh Hisaria, centre head of Allen here in city, says there is no time left now to “prepare for something new”. “Students must not try to build any new concepts in their mind at this stage. Look for your strong points and focus there,” he said.

Give one test paper daily and analyse it thoroughly, Hisaria added. “Consult with your mentors and teachers, and figure out what worked and what did not. Stick to the learning pattern that you have been following as this is not the time to change tack,” he said.

Students must go through their pointer books and revise their strong topics, feels ICAD’s director of academics Dilip Vaidya. “We tell students to keep a revision book and pointers. It’s the best time to go through these and fortify your knowledge,” said Vaidya.

Disapproving learning anything new at this point, Vaidya said, “There are 150 topics spread over three subjects. So, if you have not studied something at all till date, then it’s too late. Do not even think about weak points now because there are just two days left. The best thing is to go through your strong topics and strengthen your base.”

Vaidya added that already students have appeared for 50-60 mock tests, so they have a feel of the exam. “Don’t overburden your brain, else it will revolt. Keep cool and study even less on your last day,” he added.

Panini Telang, director of Pioneer Study Centre, said students must go through NCERT books too. “In these books students can focus on formulae, pointers etc. To revise three subjects now is almost impossible, so proceed from easy to tough,” he said.

The academic added that by studying something easier first will help build self confidence. “Brain adapts to that self confidence and can take a stronger shot at the hard topics in the last day,” said Telang.

Not advising mocks tests at this stage, Telang said, “Just two days to go and a bad performance in the mock test will demoralize the student. So, best to stick with revision of strong points and keep a cool head overall.”

The dip in number of registrations for the exam is a witness to the scare. Both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have witnessed a steep 35% decline in the number of JEE (Main) registrations. The exam is held in two phases - January and April. This year, the April session had to be postponed due to the Covid-19 induced lockdown.“My grandmother was infected by Covid-19 few months back. I secured 89.35 percentile in the January session. While I want to improve my score, I fear that appearing for the examination may put my family at risk,” said Mukesh Udaykumar, an aspirant from Chittoor.As per figures released by the National Testing Agency (NTA), 67,319 candidates from Telangana are set to appear in the September session as against 1,00,129 that appeared in the January session. Similarly, 82,748 are set to appear from Andhra Pradesh in the ensuing session as against 1,29,100 that appeared in the last session.“Last year, we had observed a 10%-15% drop in number of students that appeared in the second phase. However, this year, the drop has been much higher. Many parents may have asked students not to risk their lives in an attempt to better their scores.

The RRT team hit back saying the man got upset when they advised him to move indoors after allegedly finding him standing in the veranda of his home in Gokulpeth, close to the zone office.

Staff nurse Dwarka Bhaisare told TOI that the positive man, Kundan Seriya, who wished to be named, allegedly made derogatory remarks while answering the Covid questionnaire.

Seriya accused the nurse of being impolite all through the conversation which initially started on the mobile phone. The team first called up Seriya to know the exact location of his house. Seriya said that while guiding them, he accidentally came out to the porch of his house. “They were in a car and asked to me to walk up to them outside my compound. It was raining too. I know asymptomatic patients can’t even step outside their homes. When I pointed this out, she asked me to come with an umbrella to their car. I refused and asked them to come inside or near the gate,” Seriya said.

Bhaisare said the team pasted an alert sticker outside the house and began contact tracing. “We requested some family member to speak and let Seriya go into isolation,” she said.

Seriya said the team was reluctant to even touch the gate to open it. “She rudely asked me how many members were there in the family and people in the house. I told her about my wife and daughter and tenants who live on the upper floor. Yet, she asked me where were my other children. I reminded her that we were just three in the family. Still she continued to pester me saying where are the others,” he said.

The nurse said she was only following the questionnaire. “I was taken aback when he said ab kya paida karu (Should I give birth to more),” she said.

Senior officials said the nurse was advised to file a complaint over Seriya’s remarks.

“We face this problem daily. If I keep lodging a complaint then when will we work? I gave him the medicine and left,” said Bhaisare.

Officials claimed that Seriya was unhappy because of the delay in his test result. “He underwent the test at NU’s lower hostel centre on Monday. But as labs were not functioning to full capacity, his result was pending for three days,” they said.

352,['30/08/2020'],"Attack on Prasada home turf ‘planted’, say sources; Kapil Sibal, Tiwari back ex-Union min","BAREILLY: A day after members of the Congress unit in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district staged a protest and wrote a letter to the party's interim president Sonia Gandhi demanding disciplinary action against former Union minister Jitin Prasada for his ""anti-party activities"", sources close to Prasada in UP said that the attack was “planted”.

Prasada was one of the 23 signatories of the recent letter calling for corrective steps in the party. There has been no official word so far from any senior Congress leader in UP. Meanwhile, senior party leader Kapil Sibal has extended support to Prasada through a tweet in which he said, “Unfortunate that Jitin Prasada is being officially targeted in UP"".

On Wednesday, a meeting was held in Kheri where state Congress secretary Kumud Gangwar along with district president Prahlad Patel and other leaders raised slogans against Prasada and allegedly even called him “an agent of the opposition party”. A video of the protest later went viral on social media.

An audio clip, purportedly of Prahlad Patel, went viral on social media in which a voice can be heard saying "" I am ruined"". He then takes the names of some senior functionaries and says that he is ""just a district president"" and was ""made"" to go against Prasada. ""I am being made the scapegoat,"" the voice says.

When TOI contacted Patel regarding the audio clip, he said, “I am not aware of it. I am a mere district president and follow instructions from the high command and our loyalty is with the Gandhi family. Since the matter is regarding senior leaders of the party, I won’t be able to comment on it.”

TOI contacted Prasada but he refused to comment on the issue. However, a source close to Prasada said, “The protest against Prasada was planted by the party's district unit. Soon the truth will be revealed.”

Meanwhile, reacting to the resolution passed by the Kheri district unit of the party, Kapil Sibal tweeted: “Unfortunate that Jitin Prasada is being officially targeted in UP. Congress needs to target the BJP with surgical strikes instead of wasting its energy by targeting its own.”.

Another Congress leader, Manish Tewari, who was also a signatory to the letter, tweeted a single word “Prescient”.

Prasada represented Shahjahanpur Lok sabha seat in 2004 and Dhaurahra Lok Sabha seat, which is a part of the Lakhimpur Kheri district, in 2009. Recently he has been trying to cultivate an image of a Brahmin leader by raising issues in favour of the caste.

This special event is held in Bidnal to celebrate the spirit of communal amity In their eagerness to keep up the tradition and spread the message of communal amity, the Bidnal residents are not letting up on caution and safety measures. The organisers made it plain that they will adhere to the prescribed safety norms, which include maintaining of safe distance among the participants, compulsory donning of masks, subjecting all of them to tests using oxymeters and hand sanitisation.President of the Gajanan and Muharram Utsav Samiti Mohan Asundi said that the two occasions fall in proximity to one another for three years in a row, an occurrence that happens only once every 33 years. “We had celebrated both festivals together between 1985 through ’87. We have been celebrating the two festivals with each other since 2018,” Asundi said.However, he admitted to the pandemic ’s prevalence necessitating some changes in routine, which included cancellation of the ‘Panja’ procession and performance of folk dances. “Other events such as camps for donation of blood, eyes and health check-up, have also been done away with this year,” said Asundi, adding that the customary ceremony wherein teachers and people from other key professions were feted for their services too had been cancelled.Modinsab Nadaf, 87, who participated in the joint festivities from ’85 through ’87, said that he was very pleased to see the continuity of the tradition. “This celebration of festivals together is unique in order to spread the message of communal harmony. There will be no communal clashes should such traditions continue,” he said.In order to ensure that more people participated in the event, the organisers telecast the event on Facebook Live.

Earlier, districts in Amravati division were reporting more Covid-19 deaths In Nagpur division, only Nagpur district, especially Nagpur city, was reporting more deaths. But from August 10 onwards, death trap is spreading in other districts of Nagpur division also.Chandrapur which had reported only 4 Covid-19 deaths till August 10 has reported 24 deaths in last 29 days and reached 25. Covid-19 Death toll in Bhandara, which was only 2 till August 19 has reached 21 on August 29. Till August 10, Gondia district was having just 3 deaths. But on August 29, the toll has reached 17. Similarly, Wardha, where toll was 9 till August 10, has reached 21 till August 29. Gadchiroli is the only district in Nagpur division where toll is still 1.Nagpur, on the other hand has no comparison with any district in the division. Nagpur’s Covid-19 death toll was 334 on August 10. It has surged to 979 on August 29. Many serious patients in other districts of Nagpur division are referred to tertiary medical facilities here. Many of them die during treatment. Nagpur is also catering patients from all districts of Vidarbha as well as neighbouring states. According to official figures, 95 deaths in Nagpur (nearly 10%) are of patients coming from other states.TOI had reported on August 29 that Covid -19 transmission in Maharashtra is rapidly growing in rural and semi-urban areas that have limited access to adequate health care. State data has revealed nearly a quarter of coronavirus deaths and 28% of cases are now from villages and non-urban areas.Taking serious contingence of the increasing deaths and cases in semi-urban areas of Nagpur division, lockdown is back to Chandrapur and Wardha districts. Seven days complete lockdown in Chandrapur city will start from August 30. No one will be allowed outside except medical emergency or those involved in emergency services. Even shops of essential commodities will remain closed. Due to the rapid increase in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Wardha, Selu and Deoli Tahsil, administration has declared a curfew on August 29 and 30.In Vidarbha, 1,064 Covid-19 deaths have been reported in Nagpur division and 434 in Amravati division.

DEHRADUN: The Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) is framing a set of guidelines to reduce mortality from snakebites in the country. This comes after snake — a wildlife species that claims as many as 58,000 lives in India every year— was officially added to the country’s list of “conflict species” earlier this year.

The list is a classification of animals in the wild that humans have the most encounters with and was prepared by a developmental agency under the aegis of the German government for the MoEF. The agency in collaboration with Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) is now framing draft guidelines to curb snakebite mortalities for the MoEF.

Neeraj Khera, team leader at Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, which partnered with the MoEF in 2018 to craft guidelines to mitigate man-animal conflict, told TOI that the agency has maintained a list of “conflict species” in India since the past three years. The list has 10 species, including leopards, Asiatic elephants, nilgai and mugger crocodiles.

Wolves, which were part of the list, were replaced with snakes in February this year, taking into account that the reptiles likely claim the highest number of human lives than any other wildlife species. Estimates suggest 58,000 people die every year due to snakebites in the country. According to the World Health Organisation, India records 2.8 million snakebites every year, the highest in the world.

“There is a pressing need to address this issue as emergency complaints about snakebites to forest officials in the country have been on the rise. We will submit our draft guidelines to reduce animal-snake conflict to the MoEF by next month,” said Khera.

The guidelines will be made operational in three states — Karnataka, Uttarakhand and West Bengal — as part of a pilot project before being rolled out nationwide, said Khera.

Scientists at WII believe that a systematic approach to curb snakebites could help reduce mortalities. “Majority of the snakebite-related mortalities are due to the ‘big four’ — Indian cobra (Naja naja), common krait (Bungarush caeruleus), Russell’s viper (Daboia russelii) and India saw-scaled viper (Echis caninatus),” said scientist Chinnasamy Ramesh.

India has as many as 500 snake species, but only 60 of them are venomous. So increasing awareness among stakeholders on ways to identify different species and bites, coordinating with hospitals that store antivenom, and disbursing information on measures to mitigate occupational hazards while rescuing snakes are some of the things the draft guidelines will address.

Ramesh said the current rescue practices were “not acceptable”. “Snakes are rescued using bare hands or tongs, both incorrect practices that could harm the species. So the guidelines will also lay down standards for rescue.”

Other experts expressed hope that increased spotlight on snakebites could help address another issue — lack of options when it comes to antivenom.

Jose Louies, deputy director and chief of the Wildlife Crime Control Division at Wildlife Trust of India (Kerala), told TOI that India has only one kind of antivenom to treat all snakebites. “The same antivenom has been in use since the 1930s and may not be as effective in all kinds of snakebites. So there is need for research and development there.” Louies also said that Kerala is also bringing a policy to allow only certified snake rescuers to catch snakes in emergency situations.

KOLKATA: The name, Sunny Leone , seems to have become a nightmare for college principals in the admission season. Institute heads in Kolkata have their fingers crossed, hoping that the name of Leone, associated with Bollywood as well as the adult film industry, does not make it to their published merit lists as it did at Asutosh College .

Though Asutosh College authorities dismissed it as an “act of mischief” by someone who submitted a fake application in Leone’s name, principals of other colleges do not want to take any chance. “It is embarrassing. It indicates that our system can be breached easily and no one can spot the name of a well-known personality,” said the principal of a north Kolkata college, who along with his colleagues, double-checked their merit list before publishing. On Saturday, there were unconfirmed reports on social media that names of Sunny Leone and some porn stars had appeared on the the list of other colleges, too. After her name was published on the Asutosh College list, Leone tweeted: “See you all in college next semester!!! Hope your in my class ;)”

Due to the pandemic the entire admission process has been shifted online this year. Selected students can pay their admission fees online “Honestly speaking, we had not envisaged such a situation. We were more concerned about how to refund the application money to candidates who paid before the government waived it off. But now, we are having to scan through thousands of students to weed out fake names,” said the principal of another college. The principal of a south Kolkata college pointed out they did not want to take a chance. “I held a meeting with the admission committee of our college and requested them to go through the lists of individual subjects at least one more time.”

357,['30/08/2020'],Noted personalities urge PM to exercise caution in Char Dham Road works,"There have been several accidents caused in the past few months on the project’s sites.

Dehradun: Renowned environmentalists, former judges, academicians, scientists, and Padma Shri awardees have sent a joint letter titled “An appeal to save the Ganga-Himalayan basin” to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The letter, sent on Saturday, updated the PM about the environmental degradation caused due to his pet project — All Weather Char Dham Road — in Uttarakhand.

The dignitories, who sent the letter, includes Dr YP Saundriyal, head and professor of department of Geology at Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University; Professor Brij Gopal, founder director of Centre for Inland Waters in South Asia; Padma Shri awardee Indian historian Shekhar Pathak; Manoj Mishra, convenor of Yamuna Jiye; Padma Shri awardee Anil Joshi; and retired justice Giridhar Malviya of Allahabad high court.

Earlier, a high-powered committee (HPC) appointed by the Supreme Court for submitting a report on the All Weather Char Dham Road had got divided and had submitted two reports before the ministry.

The communication to the PM, a copy of which is with TOI, reads, “We are aware that the Char Dham All Weather Road project is close to your heart but surely you wouldn’t wish it to be carried out in an unlawful and surreptitious manner.”

The experts have clearly warned in their communication that the ongoing works of the Char Dham road would threaten the lives of pilgrims visiting the state for pilgrimage. “You wouldn’t wish it to be turned into a perpetual death trap for pilgrims visiting these shrines. Also, you would never allow the Himalayas, the sacred abode of Gods and seers, to be desecrated and its rivers polluted beyond description and would certainly not wish for these areas to become tourist hot spots as opposed to the quiet pilgrimages that they are and are meant to be,” it further reads.

The letter also pointed out at the ecologically hazardous activities that are ongoing in the upper Himalayas. “Our treatment of the Himalayas has been exploitative and disrespectful, to say the least. Highland meadows suspended between the earth and the sky, where human feet trembled to stray, now host weddings galas of the rich and famous; and rolling, flowery bugiyals like Dayara, have developed deep cracks that are being patched up with extensive coir matting. Tall buildings, townships, speeding traffic, impatient noisy horns, vehicular pollution, and dust are the living reality of any Himalayan Valley today.”

The experts also extended full support to HPC chairman Ravi Chopra while stating “strong support to one man army of Chopra”. “We strongly support the chairman’s view and demand that for the sake of Devatma Himalaya, that is vanishing daily before our eyes, the Chairman’s recommendations, whereby the damage to the Himalayan ecology will be minimised, be adopted. At the very least, all ongoing construction works with respect to the Char Dham Pariyojana shall be halted till the Supreme Court arrives at its final order.”

MUMBAI: Money was siphoned from an Andheri businessman ’s bank account, with a fake cheque and forged signature a week after lockdown was imposed in March. Andheri police registered a case on Friday after they found that the bank cleared the Rs 4.5 lakh cheque and the amount was sent to the account of Nagnath Barade at a nationalised bank’s Kalyan branch on March 31. Police are probing how the bank cleared the fake cheque.

Atul Dave (54) learnt about the fraud on April 16, when he visited the bank to update his passbook. Dave had saved the amount he got after an insurance policy matured. “The balance was Rs 4.8 lakh on March 4 after I withdrew Rs 75,000 for my garment business. The bank said the money got debited based on a cheque I had not issued,” Dave told police.

Police have sought Barade’s details from the bank. “Dave learnt from the bank that the number on the cheque cleared was never issued to anyone. It seems someone from the bank got hold of the details to forge it. We have asked for cheque details and signature,” police said. Police have also sought CCTV footage of the place from where money was withdrawn.

360,['30/08/2020'],‘Rate contract’ succour for insurance patients,"KOLKATA: The West Bengal Clinical Establishments Regulatory Commission’s (WBCERC) advisory on Friday asking private hospitals to revert to their pre-April bed charges for patients who pay by cash will not lead to any immediate financial benefit or burden for the rest who are covered by insurance.

Private hospitals across the city pointed out that insurance patients or those under various corporate and government schemes, too, will continue to pay the pre-April bed charge since hospitals were bound by ‘rate contracts’ with insurance companies that have not been altered to include the enhanced bed charges.

Those paying their bills in cash, however, will now be enjoying a 10% and 20% discount on medicines and consumables respectively.

Private hospitals enter into a rate contract with insurance companies for 2-3 years, during which the latter don’t recognize charge revisions. “Even though hospitals hike their bed charges almost every April to offset inflation , it is recognized by the insurance firms only at the end of the existing contract period. In 2020, no new contract was done so the old rates prevail across hospitals,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipto Mitra.

While rate contract periods vary between hospitals and their agreements with various insurance companies, most have their renewals at the end of 2020 or at the beginning of 2021. “So, even though we have raised the bed charge, it will be applicable to a vast majority of patients later,” said Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) president Rupak Barua, who is also the CEO OF AMRI Hospitals.

Around 80% of private hospital patients are either covered by insurance or various government and group insurance schemes. “Cash-paying patients are a small minority and their number has gone down further post-Covid. With non-Covid admissions coming down to a trickle, their number has reduced even more,” said Barua.

Some like Medica Superspecialty Hospital desisted from hiking charges this year. “It was not a conducive situation for a rate hike so we held it back. In any case, it hasn’t made any difference for any hospital,” said chairperson Alok Roy.

Hospitals, however, are worried about the 10% discount on medicines allowed to cash-paying patients. “There’s hardly a 10% margin on most drugs that makes it entirely unfeasible. We are relieved that the commission has decided to talk to pharmaceutical companies and explore the possibility of a price reduction,” said Barua.

The WBCERC had last week announced that private hospitals must revert to their March bed rates and allow discounts on medicines and consumables. It led to a sharp reaction from hospitals who argued that they were already under a financial stress due to the Rs 1,000 daily cap on consumables and were not in a state to allow further concessions.

Citing the current security scenario in the country, Maharaj demanded that if the inner line will be shifted to Jauljibi, it will not just strengthen security but will also boost tourism.

The border inner line carved after the Indo-China conflict in 1962 at Jauljibi was shifted to Chiyalekh in 1990-91.

“The Chaundas and Darma valleys, under the Dharchula tehsil of Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand, border Nepal and China and are very sensitive from the strategic and geopolitical point of view. To control the movement of outsiders from security point of view, the inner line should be shifted to Jauljibi,” said Satpal Maharaj. He added that the current inner line at Marcha is just 40 kilometres from the boundary line of China.

“Due to the ongoing border dispute with China and its expansionary policy, this inner line remains a threat to the internal and external security of our country. Also, the simple and peace loving people of Bhotia tribe who are local residents of Beans, Chaundas, and Darma valleys are surrounded at present. They are feeling insecure due to their proximity to the international border and increasing criminal activities in the region,” added Maharaj.

364,['30/08/2020'],Even-odd system brings shopkeepers at loggerheads with owners,"Ludhiana: Five days since the odd-even system had been started, city shopkeepers are jittery as they have registered a sharp decline in their sales due to the reduction in working days, which have been reduced to 2 or 3 days now. The shopkeepers, who are running their shops on rent, are more worried than those having their own shops and are now pleading before their landlords to reduce the rent for September. Meanwhile, such tenants are also of the view that this situation has given advantage to the shopkeepers having their own shops.

Suresh Dhir Raja, president of Dal Bazar Association, Ludhiana, said, “Shopkeepers and traders who have their shops on rent are worst affected. Now, those businessmen who have their own shops are at an advantage as they are not incurring any charges on account of monthly rent and they will incur less losses as compared to those traders who are running their businesses on rent.”

He added, “Moreover, there are many businessmen who have given their adjoining or opposite shops on rent and the tenants are running the same business in these shops. So the even odd system will also bring these landlord and tenants at loggerheads just because the landlords will be at an advantage. Therefore, it is our request to the government to scrap the system and either allow us to open shops continuously for five days at least.”

Sarit Sharma, a garment trader, said, “We have our shop on rent in the old city market and as it is certain that in September there will be only 11 days of work, and this will be a massive loss for us. As there is going to be no relaxation for us on front of power charges, workers’ salaries and even rentals and as a result in the next month we will have to bear huge loss even as we are already under tremendous pressure due to piling losses. It seems it will become nearly impossible for us to survive in the coming months. Therefore, we have requested our landlord to reduce the rent of our shop by at least 50% for the month of September, but he is yet to take a call on it.”

According to Sanjeev Gupta, a property dealer dealing in commercial properties, “The situation right now is same like when the lockdown opened, when a lot of re-negotiations took place between landlords and tenants due to lockdown. Right now, tenants are in panic as they are are staring at huge losses on account of their shops remaining shut for almost 20 days next month. As of now, no result has been yielded in any deals as landlords are in wait and watch mode and will take a call on or after August 31 when the state government decides about extending the even-odd system or imposing full lockdown again.”

Earlier, the seers were given jal samadhi (water burial) but the ritual polluted Ganga and hence, the state government asked for a shift from the age-old tradition.

It was also decided that an area equivalent to that used in Kumbh in 2010 would be used in the next Kumbh too. A ghat, which would be named after the revered deities of the 13 Akharas, would be made at Neel Dhara of Ganga river. The Mansa Devi hill by-pass would remain open during the Mela.

366,['30/08/2020'],Youngest heart recipient of eastern India released 11 days after surgery,"Ahasana Khatun

KOLKATA: Ahasana Khatun (17) returned home on Saturday hoping for a better life with a new heart. The teenager who had to drop out of school due to her failing heart is hopeful that by the time school re-opens after the pandemic, she would be fit to resume classes.

Khatun is the youngest heart recipient in eastern India. She was discharged from the hospital in a record 11 days after the transplant surgery at Narayana Superspeciality Hospital (NSH) Howrah.

“In addition to the heart ailment, my daughter had been suffering the mental pain of not being able to attend school for nearly two years. She is now looking forward to go back to school,” said father Sheikh Hidayatullah, an imam of a mosque in Kumargram near Haldia.

Eldest of three daughters, Khatun was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition in which the heart muscles weaken thereby reducing it’s blood pumping capacity drastically. Even as the paediatric cardiology team at NSH — comprising Amitabha Chattopadhyay, Sanjiban Ghosh and Jayita Nandy — put her on advanced heart failure medications, she had to be hospitalized frequently. Doctors had said only a transplant surgery could save her.

On August 16, ROTTO informed the hospital about a donor heart from a road traffic accident victim that matched Khatun’s blood group. The teenager then underwent the transplant surgery at NSH by a team consisting of cardiac surgeons Debasis Das and Nilanjan Dutta with Manish Sharma and Rangan Koley providing anaesthetic support.

“Post-transplant phase is crucial because on one hand we have to ensure that the body accepts the new organ by suppressing the immune response and at the same time, we have to prevent infections,” said Shubhadeep Das, paediatric cardiac intensivist who led the intensive care part.

The girl showed recovery signs within hours of the surgery. Doctors were able put her off ventilation in 13 hours. “She recovered well and fast but will need constant follow up and medications after discharge,” Debasis said.

With the family unable to afford the surgery and medications, the hospital subsidized the cost while the patient support cell raised funds. “As an imam, I don’t have the kind of income to afford the treatment. We did not have to pay either for the surgery or the medications,” Hidayatullah told TOI.

368,['30/08/2020'],Mortality rate in Kolhapur district increases to 3%,"Representative image

KOLHAPUR: The daily increase in the number of patients has also caused the mortality rate in Kolhapur district to rise sharply. The mortality rate has gone up from 1% to 3% in the past two months.

Officials said of the 383 patients at the Chhatrapati Pramilaraje Hospital (CPR), 319 are put on oxygen beds , while 39 are on ventilators. In the other hospitals in the district, 51 patients are currently on ventilator.

Official data reveals that the mortality rate in Kolhapur district in June, when the number of patients was under control, was around 1%. By mid-July, it rose to around 1%. On Friday night (August 28), the fatality rate crossed 3% with 20 new deaths being reported. The total number of deaths till Friday night was 654 in the district.

According to the official information, 366 of the 654 fatalities were among patients aged 50 years or more. Moreover, 192 of the deceased were aged 61 and 70 years, while 174 were between 51 and 60 years. In the 41-50 year age group there have been 58 deaths, while 34 in the 31-40 years age group have succumbed. Not a single death has been reported among the children below 10 years. Two patients, who were in the 21-30 year died in the district. As many as 41 deaths people aged between 81 and 90 years have also succumbed.

Officials attribute the increasing mortality rate to late admission of patients, which leaves little time for treatment. Officials said commissioning of new 20,000-litre oxygen tank and acquisition of five oxygen manufacturing companies were indicators of the seriousness of the situation. These companies have been prohibited from selling oxygen to any party other than the government.

Meanwhile, Devendra Fadnavis, the opposition leader in the state legislature said: “The infection rate in Kolhapur district has risen to 25-30% over the past few days. Currently, 1,700-1,800 RT-PCR tests are being performed. This number needs to go up. The proposal of ICU beds has been sent to the state government, which must be approved soon. Almost 80% patients are asymptomatic and need only home isolation. For symptomatic patients, there is a need for more treatment facilities.”

The past week saw a very healthy recovery rate with over 400 cops resuming duty.For the first time in the past 50 days, the total number of new Covid cases reported in Kolkata Police fell below 15. When the month began, the number was over 40 on an average. “The numbers started falling from last week. On Tuesday, fresh cases dropped to just nine. However, on Wednesday, the number went up to 20. On Thursday, there were 14 cases and we had the lowest number of fresh cases — eight — on Friday,” a senior IPS officer in charge of the welfare cell said.More importantly, the total number of active cases is now below 150 — the lowest since the beginning of July, point out senior cops. In the beginning of this month, the force had around 300-350 active cases per day. In total, 1,917 cases were reported in Kolkata Police till Friday. A total of 1,788 had recovered till Thursday noon. “We always had a very healthy recovery rate. This time, if we can manage to keep the number of new cases below 10 for a few more days, we shall know that our measures are working,” another Lalbazar officer said.Cops said the rate of hospitalization, too, saw a major drop. Most of the cops, including OCs and ACPs, were opting for home isolation.The healthy recovery rate, though, brought a challenge. The past 48 hours saw at least nine new applications for plasma donation from the police. So far, cops have donated plasma 12 times in the city. But officers said they had started receiving requests from outside Kolkata on Tuesday. “All these patients are admitted to Kolkata hospitals,” said an officer.

Community members said this is the first time in their life that they won’t see any processions, social gathering or activities related to Muharram conducted by different sects .

The Dawoodi Bohra community observed its Ashura day on Friday as per the Hijri calendar. Shabab and Jamaat member Sheikh Malik Ul Ashter Fidvi said sermons were relayed online. “Members watched the sermon by Syedna Taher Saifuddin RA,Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin RA and present Dai Al Mutlaq Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin TUS online while majlis, prayers and fasting, too, were done at homes,” he said.

MUMBAI: Eighteen months after being adopted by Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation ( MBMC ), restoration work of 18th century Ghodbunder Fort in Thane is likely to commence soon.

Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and state Directorate of Archaeology and Museums granted NOCs for beautification and landscaping of the Portuguese fort.

The fort, spread over 7.6 hectares, is the only historical monument in Mira-Bhayander and was adopted in February last year under the state government’s ‘adopt-a-fort’ scheme. The idea of adopting a historical monument was mooted by the state in 2007. Seven years later, the civic administration made a budgetary provision of Rs 25 lakh for the restoration.

The government granted heritage status to eight monuments and opened them for adoption last year. The administration is expected to spend around Rs 2 crore on beautification and landscaping.

Civic officials said the restoration plan was ready in August last year, and cleaning of the fort, including cutting grass, was on until lockdown. The officials said with NOCs in place work can be undertaken on a war-footing.

Though the fort was neglected, not much damage was done to the structure. The focus will be on restoring some damaged arches, landscaping and electricity at the precinct.

The experts will submit their report in 10 days. The sports park is coming up at this place under the smart city mission. The consultants of smart city had estimated Rs 20 crore cost for lifting the old heaps of garbage lying at the dump.

The minister, however, claimed that they had taken the experts along, who would now study everything and would give their report. He said the cost to transport the legacy waste, which is actually landfill now, was on the higher side, so they would have to wait for the report.

There is a proposal to develop sports park at this place, where space will be kept for all outdoor games. The project is being prepared under smart city mission.

Meanwhile, the cabinet minister, along with LIT chairman Raman Balasubramanium, also visited the leisure valley and work on its second part was also kicked off. In the beginning of rainy season the problem of water-logging had surfaced at leisure valley but now that issue had been resolved.

The chairman of Ludhiana Improvement Trust claimed that the first part of the leisure valley was complete and now the second part had been started. He said the second part would take some time as they had to construct canopies and sitting place for senior citizens, etc.

Bhagat also hosted two ceremonies at his residence last week, one of which was attended by Cabinet ministers Subodh Uniyal and Dhan Singh Rawat as well as governor Baby Rani Maurya. The BJP has closed its office for two days for sanitization.Sources at the BJP told TOI that around 100 attendees of Sunday’s meeting, including the CM, HRD minister Nishank, national vice president of BJP and state in-charge Shyam Jaju as well as governor Maurya, had been advised to self isolate and get Covid-19 tests done. “The chief minister had tested negative for Covid-19 last week. The test was necessitated after his personal security guard tested positive for the virus. The others have been asked to take precautions,” said a BJP functionary who did not wish to be named. Assembly speaker Prem Chandra Agarwal has isolated himself as he met Bhagat recently.Bhagat confirmed on Twitter that he had tested positive for the coronavirus and asked his contacts to get themselves tested, adding that he will resume work soon.

A city-based activist has already filed an RTI in the Punjab and Haryana high court against 109 hotels for violation of parking norms. In February, he had also made a request to the local bodies department for conducting a checking in all other hotels so that these were also included in the PIL.

The activist, Rohit Sabharwal, had filed a PIL in the court where he had submitted the list of 109 hotels. The officials had then checked the hotel premises and notices were served to the violators. A decision in this regard is still pending in the court. Now, in between the matter of other such hotels was also taken up by the activist. The activist claimed that there are many hotels in the city where parking space is being misused for other commercial purposes and people are forced to park on roadside, adding to the traffic woes.

While issuing the orders, the commissioner mentioned that in the next 15 days a report should be submitted and assistant town planners will certify that after a fresh survey no hotel was left out where violations could be found.

The municipal town planner, SS Bindra, said, “This survey will help in identify other violating hotels as well so that even those could be included in the PIL and decision should come for all hotels.” He said the commissioner issued the orders and now assistant town planners will be put on the task to conduct this survey. “If hotels have misused their parking space for other commercial purposes, then action should be taken against the owners,” he added.

Officials confirmed that work at six junctions surrounding the national park has been shelved for now.

“The KBR project has been dropped for the time being. A proposal for the flyovers and underpasses planned at the junctions surrounding the park were put before the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) last year, but approval has been pending,” said a GHMC official speaking on condition of anonymity. The plan to build multi-level grade separators around the park was to cost Rs 436 crore. GHMC sources said that the focus will now be on completing other projects. “Work worth Rs 5,000 crore is currently underway, achieving which is no small feat,” said an official.

While elated over the development, activists and environmentalists said this was not enough. Environmentalist Kaajal Maheshwari, who was at the centre of the ‘Save KBR’ campaign said: “This is a very welcome decision but needs to be officially endorsed.” She added that in 2002, the Supreme Court had directed state governments to notify area within 10km of boundaries of National Parks and Sanctuaries as eco-sensitive zone.

“From 2002 till date, the ESZ for KBR National Park has not been declared. Over the years, the 10km radius was encroached leaving only the walkway. In fact, the last proposal by this government -- that is still with MoEF -- proposes to do away with a major chunk of the existing walkway for the flyovers. The government should withdraw the existing proposal and submit a new one that protects the walkway in its entirety,” Maheshwari added. She said a GO similar to GO111 should be issued that further prohibits activities around KBR Park, especially in the buffer zone.

Some experts suggested that the Covid-19 pandemic has been a wake up call for government planning. “The pandemic has taught us that the work-from-home concept is possible... With lesser traffic being a feasible option, there must be re-think on all infrastructure projects,” said former Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) member Subba Rao.

Anant Maringanti, director, Hyderabad Urban Lab said there was a need to push for community-based infrastructure rather than big-ticket projects.

“There needs to be a re-envisioning of urban planning,” he added.

The residents in case of any clarification will be able to contact those phone numbers. In case people have any complaint regarding quality or other things, they can write to MC commissioner or other officials concerned.

Recently, the officials got the quality of roads checked through Guru Nanak Engineering College and many roads failed the test. The officials gave notices to the contractors who were forced to construct the roads again.

Meanwhile, additional commissioner Rishipal Singh said, “We are going to bring everything in public domain so that people should have first hand information about the approved works.” He said they were taking these steps to ensure better roads for the city residents because poor quality roads result in early damage as well as wastage of public money.

Road takes major quotient of MC budget

For the construction of roads the civic body keeps good amount of funds every year in the annual budget. In this financial year the budget they had kept is Rs 113 crore for the road construction and repair work while in the last financial year it was Rs 100 crore. But even after spending such a huge amount on roads the residents keep on complaining about potholes and poor quality roads.

Samples of 8 roads under scanner

Additional commissioner Rishipal Singh without disclosing the names of roads has mentioned that they are going to take samples of eight more roads which were constructed recently. After receiving the report suitable action will be taken against the contractors if any shortcomings was found.

“Now that Congress president Sonia Gandhi had clearly stated that the party organisation and president would be elected in six months, it was unfortunate that some leaders continue making unwanted statements. Such statements become even more ridiculous as the demand for elections are being made by the leaders who either never contested the elections themselves or now even they themselves may not remember when they contested last,” Jakhar said.

Stating that there were inherent contradictions in the letter written by them, he said they targeted Rahul Gandhi for “abetting division within the ranks” by holding Youth Congress elections, and on the other hand they wanted elections to be held from block level to the national body despite pandemic crisis. “Is it not applying double standards? Will these elections then not create rift in the party,” he questioned. Instead of giving a serious thought before making statements on the issue, some leaders were trying only to protect their positions, which was a sign of frustration and weakness, he added.

“Of course, I am a supporter of democracy in the party but there should be regular brainstorming within the party and the modalities of its implementation should be worked out through mutual deliberation,” Jakhar said.

The development comes in the wake of several complaints against the poor maintenance of limited height subway , which mostly remained submerged under water during heavy rainfall.

After getting directions, the local railway authorities have started identifying the limited height subways, which are worst affected and get submerged under water after only a few minutes of rainfall and later give tough time to commuters.

Divisional railway manager of Ferozepur division Rajesh Aggarwal, said “We have given directions to the local railway authorities to put up awareness boards containing helpline numbers of local railway authorities, so that commuters can easily make a complaint to the railway authorities about water-logging during heavy rainfall in the monsoon season.”

He further said that any passerby could complain to the railway authorities on their Twitter handle about the lack of maintenance of limited height subways during heavy rainfall.”

Rajinder Singh, a local resident, said “Railway officials are not giving attention to work of cleanliness and maintenance of limited height subways during monsoon, which has led to water accumulation at these places. Moreover, roads constructed under the subways also develope potholes due to poor maintenance of subway, which leads to accident during night time.”

Superintendent of police Prabhjot Singh Virk told TOI on Saturday, “The investigation is going on. We have taken technical assistance to arrest the kala kachha gang members and have also sent several police teams to trace and nab them.”

He said on the intervening night of August 19-20, some members of a kala kachha gang had entered the house of contractor Ashok Kumar and attacked him and his family members, most of whom were sleeping on the rooftop at Thariyal village near Madhopur in the district.

Ashok Kumar (58), who was husband of Raina’s paternal aunt, was killed in the incident and his wife Asha Devi (55), mother Satya Devi (80), sons Kaushal Kumar (30) and Apin Kumar (22) had sustained injuries. Asha Devi is still in a hospital in Pathankot.

Amandeep Hospital’s managing director Dr Avtar Singh said four members of the family were admitted to the hospital on August 20, of whom two were discharged on Friday and the condition of the remaining two — Asha Devi and Kaushal Kumar — is critical as both had received head injuries.

Sources said the gang had attacked the family with blunt iron objects and baseball bats and had among other things snatched Satya Devi’s earrings.

Chennai Super Kings (CSK) vice-captain Suresh Raina recently announced his retirement from international cricket.

387,['30/08/2020'],Centre should stand by its promise on GST and simply borrow more to meet financing needs: Montek,"The group of experts headed by Montek Singh Ahluwalia, economist and former deputy chairman of the Planning Commission of India, submitted its first report, titled ‘Medium & Long Term Post Covid Economic Strategy for Punjab,’ to the Punjab government earlier this month. As several questions have been raised from various quarters on the recommendations, Ahluwalia shared his views with Sanjeev Verma to clear the air on troublesome issues.

Q. Your experts’ group has been criticised for making anti-farmer recommendations. Your comments.

The report is in no way anti-farmer. On the contrary, it charts a strongly pro-farmer strategy. Let me explain.

We were asked to propose a medium to longer term strategy for Punjab post-Covid that would bring Punjab back to its earlier pre-eminent position. From that perspective, a critical objective for Punjab must be agricultural diversification, moving away from the traditional focus on food grains and expanding production of maize, fruits and vegetables, dairy etc which will generate much more income per hectare.

Punjab farmers are rightly proud of the contribution they made to food security in the days when our total food production was inadequate. But the situation has now changed. Total food grain production is more than adequate as other states have increased production. Public sector stocks are about 90 million tonnes, more than twice the required level! Over time, you can be sure that there will be much less willingness to increase the MSP for wheat and paddy just to feed surplus stocks. We should anticipate this and shift away from paddy which is highly water intensive. We have recommended reducing paddy acreage by one million hectares over the next five to six years.

Q. Why do you think this point is not being understood?

Everyone agrees that diversification is desirable, but farmers feel they cannot diversify unless there is an assured and attractive MSP. But that approach assumes that the government must always provide a market for agricultural surpluses. That was feasible for nonperishables like food grains. It is simply not feasible for perishables. In any case, the government doesn’t have to be the only buyer for farmers. Punjab has seen a tremendous growth in cotton production, which is sold in the market.

The solution lies in modernisation of agricultural markets. This, in turn, means allowing the private sector to enter and invest in modern storage and handling capacity and creating other logistical infrastructure, including links to food processing. This is the way to build a ‘farm to fork’ supply chain.

Q. Some of the recommendations in your report like opening up agriculture marketing beyond APMC are on the lines of three farm ordinances being pushed by the Centre and opposed by the Punjab government.

We have not been influenced by the central government’s ordinances. We are only recommending what the Punjab government should do and it doesn’t need central ordinances for this. Personally, I have always been in favour of liberalising access to the private sector into marketing of agricultural goods, including allowing contract farming. Both the Eleventh Plan and the Twelfth Plan finalised during the time of the NDA recommended this explicitly. We cannot expect to solve the marketing problem of diversified agriculture with an FCI-type government purchase operation, based on assured MSPs and open-ended support of losses. We need to encourage the private sector to enter into agricultural marketing and build high quality storage facilities and encourage a linkage with food processing and also exports.

Q. Your report has been criticised for advocating abandonment of free power for agriculture.

We never actually advocated abandonment of free power because we recognised that this is a politically-sensitive issue and the government had already announced that it would continue the policy and we took that as a political constraint. We did, however, draw attention to the implications of free power over the medium term. This issue does need to be discussed more thoroughly.

Farmers are not impressed by the argument that free power puts a strain on the budget because they feel it is a ploy to withdraw a benefit from farmers to improve the budget. That is not our approach. Our view is that more resources need to be directed into agriculture, including for building infrastructure, incentivising diversification and expanding agricultural R&D. However, since total resources are limited it is relevant to ask whether the resources presently spent on free power would be more beneficial for farmers if they were redirected to these ends..

The political case for free power is usually made on the grounds that small and medium farmers need support. That is certainly true, but it is actually the relatively small number of large farmers who get most of the benefit of free power. A cash subsidy per hectare of tilled land, up to a maximum of say five hectares, would be much better targeted.

A major problem created by free power is that it reduces the cost of extracting water, thereby encouraging water intensive crops such as paddy. This is an ecological disaster and has led to an alarming decline in the water table every year. Free power is in fact a hidden subsidy to paddy, with no comparable subsidy for other less water using crops. That is why we have recommended giving a cash incentive to farmers if we want them to switch away from paddy. The extra expenditure will be compensated by the reduced need for a power subsidy.

All these aspects need to be considered carefully over the medium term. For the present, we have recognised that there are political constraints so we have said that if free power must continue, we should explore second best solutions such as separation of agricultural feeders and introduction of schemes such as the ‘Paani Bachao Paisa Kamao’ scheme.

Q. Economists in Punjab believe that the focus of the experts’ group is more on inclusion of the private sector and since most of the group members are from outside Punjab, they have less knowledge of the ground realities. They also feel that there are many such recommendations which have already been given earlier by learned economists.

I have no doubt that the private sector has to play the lead role in the modernisation of both agriculture and industry in Punjab. That is true for the country as a whole and also for Punjab. However, I must point out that we are not neglectful of the role of the public sector. Infrastructure development for example is an area where the public sector has a major role to play, including through supporting various forms of PPP. In the area of health, we have clearly said that the Covid pandemic shows that public health has been neglected. This is actually true in all states, but Punjab spends less on health than it should, given its per capita GSDP. We have recommended a 20% increase every year for the next five years in government expenditure on public health.

As for the criticism that many of the recommendations have been given earlier, I must plead guilty. If policies recommended earlier have not been implemented but are still valid, it should not prevent later expert groups from repeating them. The call for diversification of agriculture, for example, has been around for 40 years. It remains valid today and in fact it is now much more urgent.

Q. Your report has also been criticised for not saying enough on how to help MSMEs.

MSMEs have been very badly hit by the downturn and there is apprehension that a large number may not even survive. Ensuring survival through the current crisis must be the immediate objective. How far this can be achieved depends upon two things — one is how quickly the economy as a whole recovers. This, in turn, depends mainly on national policies which were outside our terms of reference. The second factor affecting survival is how effectively the credit support measures that have been announced actually work on the ground in Punjab for MSMEs.

Credit delivery is the business of the banks and the Punjab government doesn’t control them. We are also concerned that the smaller MSMEs will face problems because most of them do not depend upon credit from the commercial banks. We have suggested that the Punjab government must work closely with industry to ensure that enough of the expanded credit generated actually flows to industry in Punjab to make a difference on the ground.

Looking to the post-Covid future, we need to recognise that a healthy MSME sector must be one that is efficient and capable of absorbing modern technology so that it can produce competitively to provide inputs for a modern industrial sector. The present industrial structure is unbalanced. Each sector is characteriesd by a few large units at one end and a very large number of very small units at the other end. There is a ‘missing middle’ which needs to be filled up. This means that some of the more efficient MSMEs need to grow into much more substantial middle-sized units.

As these units expand, their market share will increase and they will push out the very low technology low productivity small units which proliferate at present. If this happens in an environment where the economy grows rapidly, the transition may not cause much pain. But if the economy as a whole grows slowly, we will face real problems with a loss of a lot of low wage employment.

Q. What other things are you recommending for industrial revival?

Our sub-group on industry has compiled a list of about 120 initiatives that respond to the perceptions of industry in Punjab on what could improve the ease of doing business. All the recommendations may not be feasible, but if a large number are actually implemented on the ground, in the next six months or so, Punjab would be well placed to attract investment just as investment interest begins to revive which we expect will only happen in the middle of 2021. We have suggested to the government that we should look at these recommendations not through narrow departmental perceptions but through the wider lens of making Punjab competitive with other states. Our aim should be to put Punjab among the top four or five states as far as ease of doing business is concerned. Attracting investment is a competitve business and Punjab should learn from states which are doing better.

We have also made a number of recommendations on how to promote a culture of innovation and encourage start-ups. The start-up revolution has begun in India and Punjab should not miss out on it. Start-ups could over time be a major contributor to job creation. We have recommended a new ‘Innovation Mission,’ headed by someone from the private sector, with the government providing some support. Start-ups could over time be a major contributor to good quality job creation.

Q. Implementation of GST is facing so many glitches in its third year and the state governments have been forced to literally beg before the Centre for their GST compensation. What is the way out?

This is indeed a very serious problem. GST revenues were disappointing last year even before Covid. They will be much worse this year because the economic contraction means a huge loss of revenue for state governments. Not only will the states’ own GST revenues be lower, their share of central taxes will also be lower.

At a time when the economy is already suffering from a demand shock because the lockdown led to a loss of income, it makes no sense for the state governments to respond to the revenue loss by cutting their expenditure. The Punjab CM had written to the Centre suggesting a special Covid grant to the states which could be financed by the Centre by borrowing more, but this has not been accepted. States are now complaining that the Centre has resiled from its promise that it would make up the shortfall if GST revenue fell below a benchmark determined by a projected 14% annual increase that was agreed. The 14% benchmark was admittedly ambitious, but it was promised, and there was no suggestion that it would depend on a particular rate of growth of GDP.

On balance I feel the Centre should stand by its promise and simply borrow more to meet the cost of financing the shortfall. This will increase the fiscal deficit of the Centre but this is an exceptional year all over the world. Markets will understand as long as we make clear that we will return to a credible fiscal path when normalcy returns. Fulfilling the promise is also critical for credibility of the commitment to cooperative federalism.

Apart from the GST shortfall, the states will also face low levels of tax devolution and also other revenues. The Centre is under no obligation to meet this shortfall, but to avoid expenditure contraction in the states at a time when the economy will not have fully stabilised, the states should be allowed to borrow more if they wish. In fact, they may need accommodation not just for the current year, but also 2021-22, because revenues in that year will only come up to where they were in 2019-20. Perhaps, the Finance Commission should be asked to make recommendations on this issue.

FOR BLURBS

That (assured MSP) was feasible for non-perishables like food grains. It is simply not feasible for perishables. In any case, the government doesn’t have to be the only buyer for farmers. Punjab has seen a tremendous growth in cotton production, which is sold in the market.

Public sector stocks are about 90 million tonnes, more than twice the required level! Over time, you can be sure that there will be much less willingness to increase the MSP for wheat and paddy just to feed surplus stocks. We should anticipate this and shift away from paddy which is highly water intensive.

AGRA: The district cybercrime cell has arrested 13 youths from Tadheta Garhwar village on Friday for allegedly duping nearly one lakh people across the country of over Rs 5 crore by luring them with fake jobs and other services through online classifieds portals and social media sites.

According to police, the four masterminds of the gang — Kamlesh Kumar , 32, Prempal Singh , 24, Mansingh, 24, and Khushilal, 21 — had divided the work among themselves and even employed nine people, aged between 19 and 35, to assist them. Police said that while Kamlesh dealt with duping people seeking jobs like managers, supervisors, security guards and linemen, Prempal lured those looking for work from home and part-time jobs. They added that the other two — Mansingh and Khushilal — handled queries about discounts on online shopping and spa services respectively. The other five members of the gang are on the run.

Detailing the modus operandi of the gang, SSP Babloo Kumar said that the gang members used to place paid advertisements on online portals and social sites about jobs and other offers. When potential customers approach, they used to take the relevant personal details and advise them to register themselves on the portal set up by the accused for job offers based on qualification and experience. They used to charge anything between Rs 4,999 to Rs 49,999 for the same depending on the sort of the job applied by the aspirant, added the SSP.

Kumar said that around 1 lakh people were duped by the gang in the last two years, adding that around eight other villages in Agra are under scanner for similar frauds.

393,['30/08/2020'],‘Govt must help pvt hospitals with material &amp; manpower’,"Indian Medical Association (IMA) Nagpur president Dr Archana Kothari, a practicing gynaecologist and obstetrician, is a front-line Covid warrior. She has been assisting teams of doctors as well as the administration since day one of the lockdown and unlock 1.0. With allegations questioning the integrity of private hospitals and practitioners doing the rounds, Dr Kothari, in an interview to TOI, echoed the feelings of her fraternity with respect to the civic body, media and the society at large.

Excerpts...

Q. How would you define the commitment of private hospitals and practitioners in the fight against Covid?

A. As a duty towards humanity, we are fighting Covid for the last six months. Private health care service providers rightly understand our commitment towards society and hence, we are dedicated to the cause. We are giving our services not just for Covid but also to non-Covid patients with the same importance. On the request of the civic administration almost all big private hospitals are now serving as Covid Hospitals. Our doctors are starting telecounselling for home quarantine patients. We are also planning to post our member doctors at one or two civic-run hospitals.

Q. Is IMA and its members helping out in rural areas?

A. The IMA is working at the local, state and national level. We are assisting the government in every aspect. We are definitely helping people in rural areas. IMA branches in some districts have started Covid testing centres and doctors are helping in government hospitals as well. Only private practitioners are IMA members is a misconception. Doctors working with government hospitals are also our IMA members. Our members are spread across medical colleges, some even occupying top posts. So IMA is working through them.

Q. Why is there so much acrimony between the civic body and private hospitals?

A. The civic body and the administration should understand our problems. We have always shown our readiness to help. We are always at the forefront and helping civic bodies. We are doing our duty with dedication, but unfortunately, everyone, including citizens, is misunderstanding us. In print and social media, news regarding our fraternity is being presented in such a way that it is not only damaging our image and reputation but also demoralizing us. As the government support for health care is insufficient, the private sector is catering to 80% of the patients. If the civic body understands our problems, there won’t be any grudges or blame games. So many doctors have tested Covid positive and many have even risked their lives, but no one is stepping back.

Q. Your thoughts on the media coverage.

A. Sensational journalism must be avoided while reporting about health care workers and private hospitals. Reporters must try to investigate facts before writing about hospitals and doctors. We request the media to go into the details of any issue and confirm facts before filing reports. Recently, a lot of questions were raised regarding private labs. They were accused of giving incorrect reports without fully understanding the technicalities. A lot depends on the timing of the test sensitivity specificity and many other factors. All of us are going through a very difficult time and we need to understand each other, cooperate with each other to fight this war against Covid-19.

Q. Why are hospitals being hauled up for overcharging?

A. It’s very unfortunate that doctors are being accused of overcharging. If we look at the Covid treatment, there are many challenges that each one of us is facing. Even after paying thrice the salary and perks to health care workers and doctors, we are facing shortage of staff. Those who have worked at the forefront need to be quarantined. We also need to make arrangements for their lodging and boarding. Increased salaries. Sanitization charges, PPE, disposables, disposal of biomedical waste, repayment of loans and EMIs and hospital maintenance add up to the list of expenses. We continue to pay property tax, electricity and water bills at commercial rates. We are not getting any subsidies or GST rebate. Doing duties in PPE kits is a difficult job but somehow we are managing. We, too, have families, but we have to stay away from them to prevent them from getting infected. Despite our sacrifices and all the stress, we are threatened with registration cancellation. The government and citizens must understand the challenges faced by us and be a bit considerate.

Q. Private hospitals want GMCH to be converted into a jumbo Covid hospital.

A. Private hospitals don’t get anything for free. The occupancy rate of hospitals is around 50%. It is difficult for us to meet EMIs, machinery maintenance, salaries and fixed expenditures. Besides this, there is added exposure to Covid. But looking at our social commitment we are doing our duty relentlessly. A majority of big private hospitals and even super speciality hospitals have been converted into Covid Hospitals. We are taking care of non-Covid patients too. If all major private hospitals are taken over then where will the other patients go for treatment.

Q. What kind of support do you expect from the civic body and the district administration?

A. Please let us work in a stress-free environment with a free mind. Under stress and harassment, doctors can’t work properly. At this crucial time we at IMA request the government and authorities to help us in respect of money, material and manpower.

I will travel in our private vehicle and will carry hand sanitizer, a fitness certificate, wear masks and write the three-hour exam at the centre, where we are told adequate social distancing will be maintained. Already the exam was postponed from May 3 to July 26 and now it is slotted for September 13.”However, several students from various districts of AP and Telangana, such as Krishna, Kadapa and Warangal, who had opted to write the exam from Hyderabad as they taken coaching classes there, have decided to opt out of NEET this year after returning home. The decision was taken to avoid travelling all the way back to Hyderabad given the Covid-19 scenario.President of AP Junior Doctors Association (APJUDA) Dr N Deepchand, a PG medico said, “It is challenging for the undergraduates to write the exam amid the pandemic despite all the assurances of safety measures. Most students have come back to their native places and would have to travel hundreds of kilometres, probably a day before the exams, to reach their allocated centres. It is both risky and difficult to manage a safe accommodation in another city given the present situation, nor are hostels available.”",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77833209,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-420210,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/neet-aspirants-face-virus-risk-or-loss-of-a-year/articleshow/77826618.cms

AGRA: A 30-year-old woman from Delhi was allegedly raped by a man on a bus headed for Delhi on Saturday. There were 45 passengers on board at the time, who said they were asleep at the time.

The woman was on her way from Lucknow to Delhi. Around 7pm on Friday night, Ravi Gupta, a helper on another bus, took a lift from Gonda. “Early in the morning, I was woken up by a lot of noise. I went to the passenger’s aisle and saw a woman beating up Ravi,” said Indrapal , one of two drivers, who had handed the wheel to the second driver, Shivraj, when this happened.

The woman had called the emergency helpline, 112, and told the police that she had been raped on the bus. “This happened near the Maant toll plaza (on the Noida side of the Yamuna Expressway) around 5.30am,” said SP (rural) Shirish Chandra. So when the bus went past Milestone 65, police caught up and stopped it.

On the basis of the woman’s complaint, police filed an FIR against Gupta under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC. “I had taken the double-decker bus from Lucknow to Delhi. At some point, Ravi got on the bus. I was asleep on a sleeper seat when Ravi forced himself on me, tore off my clothes and raped me. There were 45 passengers on board when this happened,” her complaint said. The SP said passengers were all asleep and did not wake up until they heard a commotion.

When Gupta was questioned, he claimed the woman’s narrative was a false one. A resident of Bahraich , Gupta said the sex was consensual and solicited — that they didn't agree on the promised amount and that’s what the dispute was about. Gupta was arrested, produced in court and the woman taken away for medical examination.

AGRA: A Dalit widow and a man, also belonging to the same community, were publicly humiliated by fellow villagers — by tonsuring their heads, blackening their faces and even being made to wear a garland of shoes — in Mainpuri ’s Nagla Gurbaksh on Friday night for allegedly having an affair.

The villagers even tried to disrobe the woman and parade the couple in the area but both of them were rescued by police in the nick of time. A video purportedly of the episode has also gone viral on social media.

Based on a complaint lodged by one of the victims, police arrested three persons on Saturday for allegedly tonsuring the couple’s heads.

Mainpuri SP Ajay Kumar said that a case has been registered against 16 people, including 10 unidentified women, under IPC sections 499 and 500 (defamation), 269 and 270 (negligent act likely to spread infectious diseases), and section 506 (criminal intimidation). He added that they are on the lookout for the remaining accused.

Locals claimed that the duo was in an illicit relationship for the past three years. They said that a neighbour of the woman allegedly caught her in a “compromising position” with the man on Friday night after which they thrashed and publicly shamed both of them. In the viral video, some of the residents can even be heard saying that they would have “paraded them in the village if police had not arrived”.

The incident comes days after a widow and a differently-abled man were thrashed, their heads tonsured and their faces blackened before being paraded in a Kannauj village as punishment for their alleged relationship.

Encroachments carried out by influential and religious entities continue to prevail on the public land even after the court’s deadline.

Before the hearing, senior officials of JDA on Saturday inspected the park area to take stock of the encroachments. A senior JDA offical said, “On Monday, there is a hearing on the Central Park in the court. The new Jaipur Development Commissioner (JDC) inspected the area on Saturday.”

Yogesh Yadav, who filed the public interest litigation (PIL), alleged that officials were still favouring a few of the occupants and even disputed the possession claims of JDA. Though the court granted ownership of the land to JDA, encroachments continue to remain on the ground.

Yadav said, “No encroachments were removed and false affidavit was given in the court. A 10-minute video recording on the encroachments has also been presented in the court. But the authorities have not adhered to it. Though possession of a 11-bigha farm house was taken, it has not been utilised.” It was further informed that the Central Park area is a no-construction zone as per a 1996 high court order. But some people, contrary to the interest of the general public at large, have illegally encroached upon the land in the guise of religious structures and constantly carrying out illegal constructions.

The JDA allegedly failed to discharge its responsibilities. “The religious structures are expanding on the park land. The court has directed to close the gate opening inside the park. However, a small wall has been constructed and visitors can still go.”

Walking and jogging track has been developed around the entire park area which is used by hundreds of people every day. But there is no maintenance of the track and also no regular disposal of waste from the park, alleged a resident.

Thiruvananthapuram: In a move towards achieving local economic development in a sustainable manner, a collective of people has formed an NGO, Society for Socio Economic Development and Climate Resilient Communities. The initiative aims to benefit farmers and NRIs who are interested in agricultural activities.

Agriculture minister V S Sunil Kumar inaugurated the activities of the NGO in eight panchayats of Chirayinkeezhu through video conferencing on Saturday. Deputy speaker V Sasi presided over .

“The project provides a platform for youth, NRIs and people searching for a job to understand the potential in the agriculture sector. When central government policy for agriculture only benefits the corporates, these local communities are needed to protect the sector. Our society has human resources who can support such initiatives,” said V S Sunil Kumar.

The project has been launched in line with Subhiksha Keralam scheme of the state government. They have titled their activities under the brand name Ashtamudi, and around 200 farmers who live in eight panchayats in and around Chirayinkeezhu will associate with the project initially.

“Chirayinkeezhu was chosen for its tourism and agriculture possibilities. Our idea is to bring in transparency and give better value for agricultural produce of farmers, even when the prices of vegetables and chicken is low. Avoiding the middlemen, we will directly sell the agriculture and poultry products in the market. We have experts in these fields to guide and also people from IT background in our team to deal with the technical aspects,” said N Muraleedaran Pillai, secretary of the society.

Projects will be taken in the area of vegetables, poultry, aquaculture, dairy, eggs and handlooms. The major objectives include best practices in agriculture and allied activities, solid waste management, training and skill development in related areas, linkages in inputs and marketing, technology and project support for value addition, community development programs in health, hygiene and education, micro enterprises development and cluster type development model, awareness and extension services for various schemes of central and state governments, women empowerment and economic development of marginalized communities.

“Due to Covid crisis, many NRIs are returning to the state. There may be people interested to engage in activities related to agriculture and we are providing a channel to connect them with the possibilities. I will be handling the handloom wing in the project and proposals like starting a garment unit here are under consideration,” said Sobha Viswanath, one of the founding members.

HISAR: Soon after the Haryana government approved the construction of a 33kw sub-station in Sadalpur village of Adampur assembly constituency in Hisar district , leaders from both ruling and opposition parties are clamouring to claim credit for the project, which is yet to take shape.

Prominent among those vying for the credit are Congress MLA from Adampur Kuldeep Bishnoi and Sonali Phogat, the BJP leader, who lost to the former in the 2019 assembly election. Both have claimed that it is due to their efforts that the project has been approved, though the power minister described it as a normal process.

Bishnoi claimed that on the demand of villagers, he made efforts and requested the minister of power Ranjit Singh Chautala and managing director of the electricity board Shatrujit Kapoor to fulfil this demand of the villagers. He said that apart from Sadalpur, he is also making efforts for electricity sub-stations in Kohli and Kaliravan villages.On the other hand, Phogat claimed that when the villagers told her about the problem of power, she met the power minister and also spoke to Kapoor. “With my efforts, now the 33kw power sub-station has been approved in Sadalpur. This powerhouse will be built over 2 acres of land located behind the waterworks in the village. The construction work will be completed by April,” Sonali said.

MC officials are struggling to recover dues from them.

The municipal corporation sent several notices to various institutions but to no avail. Meanwhile, Deswal filed a complaint with the CM window for recovery of property tax in the limits of the Panipat MC. He held MC officials responsible for failure to recover the property tax and sought action against errant officials.

Sources said Panipat MC earns nearly Rs 23.69 crore from nearly 1.41 lakh property tax payers every year. Pending dues have caused a financial crisis and development work was being affected, sources added.

406,['30/08/2020'],Sanction given for Kottarakkara flyover,"Kollam: State government has given administrative sanction of Rs 59.5 crore for the construction of a flyover at Pulamon junction in Kottarakkara. PWD minister G Sudhakaran said in a statement that the demand for a fly over at Pulamon junction on the MC Road was a long pending one. Once the flyover is constructed traffic bottle neck at Pulamon junction could be avoided, he said.

The minister also directed officials to initiate further steps for the construction.

Kollam-Thirumangalam National Highway crosses the MC Road at Pulamon junction and so traffic snarls are a regular feature. During office hours, the long queues of vehicles on the MC Road and the NH extend to more than 1km, forcing passengers being stuck in traffic jams for about half an hour. A flyover passing through Kottarakkara town has been a long pending demand of the people.

As KSRTC bus station and the private bus stand are close to junction, the buses entering and coming out of the bus stations cause heavy traffic block on the MC Road and NH.

If any political rally or local festival takes place along the road which in fact occurs at regular intervals, the situation gets out of hand.

It has become a common sight to see people accompanying patients in a serious condition on ambulances pleading with the vehicle ahead to give way to them at this traffic bottleneck.

The headquarters of various congregations of Pentecostal churches are also located along the MC Road close to Pulamon junction, and they conduct prayer conventions at regular intervals, besides the usual Sunday prayers. Thousands of people converge in this part of MC Road and NH, making it a tough task for the traffic police to clear the way.

The JDA, through the survey, will identify encroachments, roads, parks and will also use the survey for effective land planning in times to come.

Officials said chances of discrepancies through drone survey are minimal and once the land survey is available online, real estate buyers will be able to get the information about it sitting at their home.

411,['30/08/2020'],Jharkhand CM’s poll: Students back delaying NEET &amp; JEE,"Ranchi: Around 78% of the 1.78 lakh Twitter users, who took part in an online poll called by Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren over a 24-hour period that ended on Sunday night, said this year’s NEET and JEE aspirants will not face difficulties in their careers if the examinations are postponed after taking into consideration the health risks arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Late on Saturday night, Soren initiated an online polling on his verified Twitter account and sought suggestions from his “young doctor and engineer friends” about the ramifications if the exams are postponed. “I want to particularly ask and seek feedback from my young engineer and doctor friends. Will students face huge difficulties if #JEENEET exams are postponed?” The respondents were to answer in yes, no and don’t know.

Till 8pm on Sunday, 1.78 lakh users had responded to Soren’s tweet. Soren’s office said: “Till 8pm, 78% of all the respondents said postponement of the exams will not cause difficulties while 20% said they will. Around 1% said they do not know.”

The online exercise, which ended at 1am on Monday, came hours before the Supreme Court was due to hear the petition of six states against the conduct of NEET and JEE exams. While NEET is slated to begin from September 1, JEE is scheduled on September 13 and JEE (Advanced) will be held on September 27.

Explaining the rationale behind the exercise, Soren in a written response to TOI’s query, said: “The Union government has been taking decisions unilaterally amid the pandemic. I sought the opinion of students on social media to demonstrate how far away the Centre is from the ground reality and how it is trading the health and safety of the students.”

Rajshree Nayak, a Twitter user, wrote to Soren: “I am a student of IISER (Indian Institute of Science Education and Research). Given that these courses are 4.5-5 years long, the academic calendar can be easily rescheduled and extra classes can be taken to manage the course in stipulated time. Health is more valuable, given that the syllabi are manageable.”

A twitter user, who goes by the account @swamijisaveus, wrote: “We wont face any difficulties as experts and institute managements have said that the academics can be managed as it will cost us just one semester.”

As per estimates, 45,000 students from the state will appear in JEE and NEET examinations. Earlier, Soren had written to Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal “Nishank” seeking postponement due to the lockdown of hotels and public transport and the health risks involved. On Friday, the state government permitted hospitality sector and intra-state public transport to resume operations to facilitate the aspirants and their parents.

The BJP, which had accused the ruling mahagathbandhan of misleading students, on Sunday launched a state-level helpdesk to facilitate the aspirants. BJP’s state president Deepak Prakash said helpdesks will be set up outside all exam centres across the cities and provide all necessary assistance to the aspirants and their parents.

412,['30/08/2020'],‘Babulal reluctant to accept BJP’s Dumka poll offer’,"Ranchi: With the decision to name Babulal Marandi BJP’s leader of opposition pending with the assembly speaker for seven months, the saffron party is now planning to nominate Jharkhand’s first chief minister as its candidate for the Dumka bypoll, an idea that Marandi is not too keen on.

Chief minister Hemant Soren had vacated the prestigious assembly seat and decided to retain Barhait in January and the bypoll would have been concluded by July had the Covid-19 outbreak not deferred all the polls since March.

Marandi had won from Dhanwar assembly segment as a JVM-P candidate, but merged his party with BJP in February, with two other party MLAs – Praddep Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey – joining Congress. Despite the Election Commission recognizing JVM-P’s merger with BJP as valid, speaker Ravindra Nath Mahto, who is weighing this case under anti-defection law, is still to give a verdict and continues to recognize Marandi, Yadav and Tirkey as JVM-P lawmakers.

Despite being largest opposition, BJP still doesn’t have an officially legislative party leader, which, party workers say, is a matter of concern as the aim to bring him to the party was to regain its lost ground in tribal pockets. Anticipating further delays, BJP is activating Plan B to get LOP status for Marandi. A senior BJP leader said, “Many have suggested that we field him from Dumka. If he wins on a BJP ticket, he will become the LoP easily. The tribal hotbed also has immense political significance for future polls.”

Another insider added that the suggestion to field Marandi from Dumka has come from the party brass in Delhi. “Recently, our central leaders asked us to explore the possibility, but he (Marandi) does not seem to be keen to contest. He is aware that his rivals within BJP will unite to sabotage his chances. If he loses, his political career will be over,” he said.

Marandi has a long history with Dumka — he first won from here in 1998 parliamentary polls on a BJP ticket, defeating JMM stalwart Shibu Soren and boosted his political stature with a place in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet. Two years later, he became the first chief minister of Jharkhand after it was carved out of Bihar.

When contacted, state BJP president Deepak Prakash said the party high command will take the call in this regard at an appropriate time. “BJP named Babulalji as our leader of legislative party long ago, but the ruling dispensation is illegally trying all the tricks to devoid him of the status. We are trying even submitted a memorandum to the governor seeking her intervention into the impasse.”

Lalu, who is undergoing jail term in fodder scam cases, is currently lodged at the director’s bungalow of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) in the capital city for treatment. Two other people — identified as Yogendra Rai and Chotelal Yadav — sustained injuries in the mishap and were rushed to Rims, officer in-charge of Barhi police station Uttam Kumar Tiwari said.

Tiwari further said that the driver of the vehicle took a wrong route to Patna from Barhi by turning towards NH-2, which leads to Delhi via Chouparan owing to lack of proper visibility on the way. The vehicle then crashed into a stationary oil tanker near Barsot village under Barhi police station.

“All three sustained serious injuries from the impact of collision. Unfortunately, Bijendra died during treatment,” he said.

RJD sources said that the deceased leader came to meet Lalu to lobby for a party ticket from Mahishi constituency, ahead of the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar. “Bijendra was a former councillor from Saharsa,” the source added.

414,['30/08/2020'],"Jharkhand: Stringent norms for bus travel, fares to rise","Picture for representational purpose only.

RANCHI: A day after the state government allowed intra-state bus transport, bus operators in the state on Saturday said they are gearing up to roll out their fleet for the first time since the lockdown in March even as the transport department has made a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) ready to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

The intra-state bus services , along with the opening of hotels, lodges, restaurants and eateries will provide the much-need service for the public, particularly the students, ahead of the JEE and NEET exams.

Jharkhand Bus Owners’ Association president Arun Budhiya said they will follow the SOP for public safety but hinted at a hike in bus fares to make up for their losses in the past 150 days. “Our buses remained grounded all through the lockdown and during this period, the rate of diesel has gone up by at least Rs 15. In addition, all buses will have to ply with 50% capacity. These factors are forcing us to hike the fares, details of which will be announced soon,” he said, demanding that state government should also waive off road permits and taxes during the lockdown period.

State transport secretary K Ravi Kumar said they have prepared an exhaustive SOP for the services like mandatory thermal scanning for every passenger before boarding a bus. Anyone whose body temperature is beyond the permissible limit will be barred from undertaking the journey, he said. Moreover, there should be sufficient distance among passengers on board buses and bus operators must sanitise seats/railing of a vehicle every time a passenger boards and alights it, Kumar said, adding that only buses with valid road and route permits from the competent authority will be allowed to ply.

To curb overloading, the department has capped bus passenger capacity to about 50%. For example, a 52-seater bus will carry only 26 people while only 24 people will be allowed in a 48-seater bus and so on.

Kumar also said carrying passengers in the driver’s cabin is also banned. “The cabin around the driver’s seat should be properly covered by a plastic sheet and all bus staff onboard are mandated to wear masks, gloves and face shields,” he said.

The SOP advises passengers to limit touching any surface of the bus as much as possible and refrain from consuming tobacco and related products to prevent spitting. “Spitting or consuming tobacco in public places is a punishable offence,” Kumar stressed.

For a better contact-tracing exercise in the event of anyone testing positive for Covid-19, every bus operator is mandated to keep a detailed record of every passenger and is advised to download the Aarogya Setu app for those having smartphones. “Every bus operator should regularly share details of their drivers and staff on each route and keep a record of passengers so that in the event of any Covid-19 cases, contact tracing can be done easily,” he said.

Respective district administrations and civic bodies have been asked to ensure proper cleanliness and sanitization of bus stands and district transport departments and keep a tab on violations through regular inspections.

416,['30/08/2020'],"Sanitisation of premises will take time, business to start on Tuesday","RANCHI: With the state government allowing reopening of hotels, lodges, shopping malls and salons through an unlock order issued late on Friday evening, business owners have started cleaning and sanitising their establishments before they welcome customers. However, most of them said they will not be able to resume business before September 1 as the process to sanitize the establishments will take time.

At Birsa Munda bus terminus on Saturday, cleanliness staff and mechanics were seen cleaning the area and working on buses, many of which have electrical faults while some needed their engines to be worked upon.

Talking to TOI, the president of Jharkhand Pradesh Bus Owners’ Association, Sachidanand Singh, said, “It will take another two to three days to resume services as most of our buses need maintenance. We are also facing a manpower crisis as drivers, conductors and other staff retuned to their homes after the lockdown was enforced. We hope to roll out buses from September 1.”

Hotels have started sanitization before they start taking bookings from guests with many of them installing sanitization chambers and ensuring contactless check-ins. “We have collaborated with an international agency to clean our hotel. A 20-step protocol has been formulated on hygiene and cleanliness and we are also providing car sanitization for our guests. Wearing masks and face shields by our staff and declaration of health condition of the staff and guests have been made mandatory. All guests will be scanned with thermal guns,” said Devesh Kumar, director sales, Radisson Blu hotel.

Restaurants which were home delivering food have started taking measures to facilitate start dine-ins. “We will maintain one metre distance between tables and the use of masks and sanitizers will be a must for all employees and guests,” said Luv Bhatia, owner of Kaveri Restaurant in Lalpur.

Salons too have made elaborate arrangements and maximum of them were seen busy cleaning their spaces on Saturday. In order to regulate the footfall of customers, some salon owners have decided to attend guests on the basis of appointments and no waiting will be allowed.

“We will be starting our services from September 1, but we are working on a model wherein our customers will not have to wait at the salon in order to avoid overcrowding. We will be providing services based on appointments only and every customer will be subjected to thermal scanning and sanitized before entering the premises ,” said Mohit Prashant , owner of Be You salon chain in Ranchi.

However, despite all measures, Ranchiites seem to be worried over the large scale reopening. Ritu Choubey, a student, said, “At a time when Ranchi is reporting around 1,000 cases on a daily basis, I wouldn’t risk going out for a meal with friends at restaurants or visit a salon for a haircut.”

Interestingly, even shop owners at malls do not expect a jump in sales instantly and said business will pick up only after the effect of the virus reduces. “I got my entire stock removed from the display area, cleared my storage space and got the spaces sanitized. Customers need to feel confident else we will not have business,” said Md Aamir, owner of a branded footwear showroom at Nucleus mall.

417,['30/08/2020'],LS committee summons Deoghar SP in Dubey case,"Dumka/Ranchi: The privilege committee of the Lok Sabha has summoned Deoghar superintendent of police, Piyush Pandey, to appear in person before it on September 8, taking cognisance of the complaint filed by BJP’s Godda MP Nishikant Dubey .

On July 15, Dubey had submitted before the panel saying his privilege has been breached after the Jharkhand Police filed false FIRs against him and his family members to harass them as part of a “political vendetta”.

He added that such acts are creating a hindrance in his discharge of parliamentary duties in Godda.

At least three FIRs are currently filed against Dubey and his family members in different police stations of Deoghar district, falling in the Godda parliamentary constituency since in recent months.

On July 14, one Vishnu Kant Jha filed an FIR against Dubey and his wife for duping the state exchequer by illegally purchasing land in Deoghar. Recently, one more FIR was filed in the town police station challenging his educational qualifications and accusing Dubey of forging an MBA degree from the Delhi University. The ruling JMM had tweeted expressing doubts about Dubey’s qualifications.

Chief minister Hemant Soren via his counsel had also slapped a defamation notice against Dubey recently after the latter demanded the Maharashtra government and the Union home minister to reopen a case of rape filed against Soren in 2013 by a woman in Mumbai.

The complainant had withdrawn the case against Soren. Dubey demanded reopening of the case citing Supreme Court orders which prohibit anyone to take back complaints on heinous crime arbitrarily.

State BJP president Pratul Shahdeo accused the state police of acting at the behest of the ruling dispensation to harass opposition leaders in Jharkhand by filing false cases.

Citing the example of the educational qualification FIR against Dubey, he said, “It was probably the first such case in the country where police filed an FIR against an MP taking note of a tweet of a political party (JMM). The FIR doesn’t mention sufficient evidence against our MP, which clearly shows how the police are acting according to their political masters in this state. The way BJP leaders are being targeted and killed in Jharkhand is proof enough of vendetta.”

DIG (Dumka range) Sudarshan Pasad Mandal, however, denied the charges of slapping false FIRs against Dubey. He said, “The official concerned will place his stand before the Privilege Committee of the Lok Sabha as and when the time comes.”

JAMSHEDPUR: In order to check suicides, East Singhbhum district administration recently partnered with Jeevan, a Steel City-based suicide prevention centre. This comes at a time when the district recorded more than 100 suicides since the imposition of the lockdown in March, with at least 80 in the last four months.

As a part of the initiative, the administration pasted posters and put up banners in at least two dozen locations across Jamshedpur, including at the quarantine centres. Deputy commissioner Suraj Kumar took personal interest in the initiative, said sources in the administration. The posters and banners contain the centre’s helpline numbers (9297777500, 9297777499, 9955377500, 9955435500) and the office address.

Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC) City Manager Ambuj Kumar Singh said the initiative is in the interest of society hence the urban municipal body is cooperating in putting up banners and posters. “We will further help Jeevan if their officials suggest us new locations in the city for the banners,” Singh said.

Speaking to the media, director of the centre, Jeoraj Jain said, “Suicides have increased in Jamshedpur ever since the lockdown was imposed. It’s been just four days since the posters were pasted and we are already receiving calls four to five times more than the usual inflow of around five to seven.” Jain informed that unlike pre-lockdown times, the centre is not running 24x7 and had to change the timing to 10am-9pm in view of the night curfew in Jamshedpur.

“We also faced a shortage of staff after the lockdown was imposed, but after the relaxations, things are better,” Jain said.

He also said that most of the callers are factory workers, vendors and small-time earners whose income have been hit, leading them to “anxiety and mental depression.”

Jain said that most of the callers are above 40 years of age who feel dejected after losing their source of income. “Of the total number of suicides, 30 were committed by people above 45 years of age,” said an official at the centre.

Jain added, “We are also planning to organise counselling sessions at quarantine centres and for patients in home isolation with support from psychiatrists. Counselling is the best tool to deal with depressed minds and works wonders when used to de-stress people.”

Many aspirants, who reached the centres from faraway places, missed the paper due to server problems and also due to lack of coordination between the officials deployed there for holding the exam. After the fiasco, aggrieved students and parents protested against NATA demanding rescheduling of their papers.

The entrance exam is conducted by the Council of Architecture (COA) at the national level for admission to the five-year Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) course at all recognized institutions across India. It’s headed by renowned city-based architect Habib Khan.

Admitting that there was a technical snag during the exam, Khan told TOI that problems faced by the students would be addressed soon. “We will ensure that the students don’t suffer. They will be given another chance if the fault is technical. We’ve received many complaints through our help desk from Nagpur and other centres. By Sunday, we will be able to know the exact details.”

Khan added that the COA had handed over the online exam part to a contractor and some problems may have developed in the software. “There’s also a possibility that students may have experienced problems like connectivity and bandwidth at their homes,” he said.

A number of students got their computers late, resulting in loss of time at the Central India Law College. “No signposts were put up at the centres which led to chaos. Neither were any social distancing rules followed. Students completed their exam at 2.30pm itself, but were still not allowed to leave the premises,” a parent told TOI.

It was Vanshita Vajirani’s maiden attempt, but she couldn’t get connected due to technical glitches in the server for a long time. “I kept on trying from 9.45am, but I missed the first part. I tried to appear in the second part, but couldn’t get connected,” she said.

Students also complained about rough sheets being provided to them 10 minutes after the commencement of the exam. They clicked on the question, but the answer wasn’t submitted.

“It was a case of total mismanagement. Inside the exam hall, too, improper arrangements resulted in wastage of a lot of time,” said Sarthak Pethkar.

Aarsh Kandra said the standard operating procedure (SOP) wasn’t followed. “Attendance was taken after the exam ended which resulted in a long wait. The server functioned badly because of which I lost three important questions,” he said.

421,['30/08/2020'],"11,000 hit as rivers swell after heavy rain in Madhya Pradesh","Nagpur: Heavy rain in Madhya Pradesh has left rivers in Vidarbha flooded. More than 11 ,000 persons from 25 villages in Nagpur district have been displaced, making it comparable to the floods of 1994.

Two teams of the National Disaster Relief Force and one of State Disaster Relief Force were pressed into action. The district administration has also requisitioned Army’s help, which will start operations from Sunday.

Water released from Totladoh and Kamptee Khairi inundated Kamptee, Mouda and Parseoni and Kuhi tehsils. Pench water further merged into Kanhan river near Kamptee, leaving parts of the town marooned.

The flood-situation has also led to water shortage in Nagpur city. According to a spokesperson from Orange City Water Ltd, the Kanhan water treatment plant (WTP) intake wells are submerged in the flood waters. “The wells are operating at half the capacity, thus reducing water pumping and affecting the supply to Ashi Nagar, Satranjipura and Nehru Nagar zones. Water supply to these areas will be restricted as the flood waters will take minimum three to four days to recede,” the spokesperson said.

The gates of Chaurai dam on Pench river in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh, have been opened, leading to flooding on the Maharashtra side towards the Totladoh dam whose all gates have been opened up to five metres.

The displaced persons have been shifted to schools and other government buildings. Kamptee is worst hit, with 6,600 persons affected, followed by Mouda with 1,500 persons. The number of affected persons and villages is expected to increase, said a source in the collectorate.

In Kamptee, over 250 persons from Sonegaon Raja village were shifted earlier based on the flood warning, but they returned to their village. “Rescue operation was again launched in the evening,” said an official in the district administration.

Residents of Kamptee shared videos of their inundated localities. In one of the pictures, residents were seen wading through chest-high water to reach a safer place.

In neighbouring Chhindwara district, 4,500 persons have been displaced. A Mi-17 helicopter from the Indian Air Force’s base at Nagpur flew to rescue six persons stranded at two of villages in the district. They were among the 20-25 persons rescued from critical situation. Another helicopter was kept standby for Nagpur.

According to the calculations made at the time of finalizing the dam’s design, Friday’s flood was equal to the deluge estimated once in 500 years, said a senior official in the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC).

Currently, there is an inflow of over 9,000 cubic metres per seconds (cumecs) of water in the Pench river, of which 6,600 is being released. This is having a cascading effect on the Kanhan river leading to flooding ot nearby areas as there is no dam on the river. Another 6,800 cumecs are flowing out of Kamptee Khairi also.

“Had the Totladoh dam not been there, as much as 16,000 cumecs of water may have flown into the Kanhan river, leading to situation turning worse,” the source said. Attempts are being made to contain the water at Totladoh.

Currently, as much as 13,000 cumecs of water is flowing from Kanhan. The water is further flowing into Wainganga river. This has led to record release of water from the Gosikhurd dam on the river. Now, as much as 21,000 cumecs of water is being released from the dam with a likelihood of the flow being increased. “This is next to the flow in 1994, when there was no dam on the river, due to an inflow of 27,000 cumecs,” the source said.

Elsewhere in region, there are chances that Gadchiroli may see more floods if the rain continues. There is no dam but one barrage (Jisdoh) in the district which may have to be opened if the inflow increases. The Medigatta barrage on the Telangana side may be opened too, affecting Gadchiroli.

No major floods have been reported in west Vidarbha but mild rain continues.

The Totladoh dam had run dry two years ago, leading to water crisis in the city. The Madhya Pradesh government had then stopped releasing water from Chaurai dam on its side of the Pench river due to less storage there.

NEW DELHI: A 23-year-old man was tied to a tree and beaten to death by four men on suspicion of mobile phone theft in West Delhi's Naraina early on Saturday. Based on witnesses' accounts, the four accused were arrested soon after the crime. On Thursday, a man who was looking for his missing son was beaten to death by two men in the city.Police said they were informed about a man's body lying at a park with injury marks. Witnesses said they woke up around 5am on hearing the cries of the victim who was beaten with sticks and iron rods by four men at Loha Mandi in Naraina, police said. A rope and a white muffler were recovered from the spot.One of the witnesses, Shesh Kumar (30), said he saw four local men tying the victim with a tree at the park and beating him mercilessly. ""I tried to stop them. But they refused to listen. They said the man stole a phone from their truck,"" said Kumar.The deceased was identified by police as Rahul, a resident of west Delhi’s Kirti Nagar. His family members said that Rahul had left home after an argument with his wife Pooja on Thursday evening.“He (Rahul) was released from jail on August 17. On Thursday evening we had an argument about the rainwater getting inside our house. He picked up his bag and left home saying he would come back only after getting a job,” said Pooja.“Rahul was jailed multiple times. I started looking for him on Friday morning. Assuming the cops might have picked him up, I went to the police station around 11am. Later, I was told that he was killed,” Pooja added.The four accused were identified by police as Mustaq Ahmed, Shiraj Ahmed, Anees and Istihar. “The accused said that Rahul and his accomplice had stolen the mobile phone from Siraj’s truck and fled.

Active cases cross 1,000 in Noida after two months

NEW DELHI: The daily count of Covid-19 in Delhi neared the 2,000 mark with 1,954 new cases - highest single-day tally in 50 days - being recorded on Saturday.With this, the total tally of Covid-19 cases in the state has crossed 1.7 lakh and the death toll has mounted to 4,404. In the last 24 hours, 15 fresh deaths were reported due to Covid-19, officials said. On July 30, it had reduced to less than 3,000 and continued to be so till August 5. But, with rise in new cases, occupancy of Covid beds is also up. On Saturday, data shared by the hospitals on the Delhi Corona app at 8 pm, showed as many as 4,022 (28% of the total beds) were occupied. The rate of occupancy of ICU beds without ventilator support and those with ventilators stood at 50% and 39%, respectively.Data showed 17 public and private hospitals, including Lady Hardinge Medical College, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Max Patparganj, Apollo, and Primus hospitals among others, didn’t have a single ICU bed without ventilator support available on Saturday. Total 28 hospitals mentioned on the Delhi Corona app didn't have ICU beds with ventilator support available.Doctors say if the rise in new cases continues at the pace seen in the last one week, Delhi could be staring at another serious crisis soon. “Not just new cases, the positivity rate – number of confirmed cases from those tested – has also increased. It is a worrying sign,” said a senior doctor at Lok Nayak hospital. On Saturday, the positivity rate was recorded at 8.8% with 1954 persons testing positive from 22,004 tested.Earlier, from Monday to Friday, the positivity was recorded at 8.9%, 7.7%, 8.5%, 8.7%and 7.8%, respectively.In July, the positivity rate had reduced to less than 6% signalling that the disease spread was under control.Dr S K Sarin, the director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), who is also part of the task force to manage the Covid situation in the state, says lower rates of RT-PCR testing could be one of the reasons behind the spike in cases. “Rapid antigen tests have lower sensitivity. It throws a high rate of false negative results. It is possible that many people who tested negative in the rapid antigen test were actually positive and continued to spread the infection,” he said. Dr Sarin stressed the need to increase RT-PCR testing at least for people with co-morbidities and those living in containment zones because it has a better sensitivity to Covid-19.Health experts have pointed to the lack of social discipline among the public. “People aren’t following social distancing norms. If you go to a market, there are many people who aren’t wearing masks and even those who have it don’t wear the masks properly. This has to change. People have to become more responsible to reduce disease spread,” say doctors.Active Covid cases in Noida surpassed the 1,000-mark after over two months. On Sunday, 122 new cases took the district’s count of active cases to 1,002. Before this, the number of active cases had touched 1,100 in mid-June.Since then, active cases in Noida have hovered around the late 900s but never crossed 1,000. Officials said that since residents have been venturing out more with the ease in restrictions, chances of contracting the infection have grown manifold. “Also, testing in Noida has been scaled up. We have resources to handle active patients and will continue to maintain the pace of testing,” chief medical officer Deepak Kumar Ohri said.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77829456,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-443436,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-at-50-day-high-with-nearly-2000-cases/articleshow/77829444.cms

428,['30/08/2020'],Mumbai: Retail therapy seekers take baby steps back in to shops and malls,"Weekend footfalls at this Malad mall have dropped sharply

MUMBAI: Among the many pastimes interrupted by the virus has been ‘retail therapy’ — a ritual that is as much about the browsing as the buying. And the reopening of non-essential stores in the city earlier this month brought sharper focus on this coping mechanism for the stressed-out or plain bored with Mumbai faring better than other cities in encouraging shoppers back into shops and malls.

“It felt a bit weird and scary at first. I was overwhelmed by the thought of stepping into a public space with strangers but there were hardly any shoppers and very few staff. Also trying out new shoes was such an adrenaline rush, almost a confidence booster after days of being bogged down at home,” gushed Natasha D’Cunha, 27 from Dadar after she hit a factory outlet in Parel for the first time in five months last week. But the days of leisurely shopping trips are no more. Unable to endure the stifling face mask for long, she made an early exit. “I’m not someone who shops online. I like to touch and feel what I buy but I also realise the need to stop indulging my impulses of going out shopping just because they’re open.”

While masks and sanitisers are common prerequisites across stores and malls, safety measures include touchless frisking at entry, occupancy apps to track the number of customers, temporary suspension of trials and exchanges, foot-operated door handles, hard-tomiss floor markings.

The return to normal business, however, could be a long way off. Shops are still reeling from an entire season rendered redundant and a dramatic decline in sales despite the easing of lockdown restrictions. When Trios, a three-storeyed fashion mall in Bandra, cautiously opened its doors for walk-ins on alternate days in July, the footfall had dropped to seven in 15 days as opposed to 150 shoppers in a day. “The months of April and May are when we see peak season sales because people go on summer holidays and there’s Eid. All the fancy new inventory that we had procured are still lying wrapped. Although footfall has picked up this month, it’s mostly for kids clothing or casual wear,” says Chirag Gada, owner of Trios. Gada has his hopes pinned on the next festive season to “liquidate” his pent up stock but is cautious about running promotions. “We have to be careful about drawing large crowds.”

It hasn’t been too tough on malls trying to implement social distancing norms given the low footfall. Malad’s Infiniti Mall, for instance, that drew close to 1 lakh people on weekends, sees not more than 20,000 now since they reopened on August 7. “The government mandates 25 sq ft space per person in the mall and so we don’t see a necessity for capping the number of visitors right now,” says CEO Mukesh Kumar, adding that the draw in Mumbai’s malls was more encouraging than the reopenings in other cities.

Some malls have put up protective glass on the reception desk for visitors' safety while some like the Oberoi Mall, have placed a UV box at the desk to ensure all gift vouchers, coupons, documents, lost & found items are sterilized using ultraviolet technology before being handed over to customers.

The contagion has also put a leash on people’s impulses to touch, feel and try clothes on before buying. At stores like Trios and New Variety Store in Bandra or most retail stores at Malad’s Infiniti Mall, trial rooms are off-limits for now. If at Shoppers Stop outlets, alternate trial rooms are open for use, Ghulam Khan of New Variety Store uses his art of his persuasion to urge his customers into exchanging the item with a family member, instead.

If digital catalogues and video consultations are being recommended by high end designers who already had their ecommerce in place, some boutiques like Pankaj & Nidhi have used this time to ramp up their online presence or launch a website. Even shops like Bandra’s six-year-old New Variety Store are contemplating the click-and-collect model.

While electronics, jewellery, sports and fitness goods have been flying off the shelves, eyeshadows are now the new lipstick. “Eye makeup accentuates a face covered in a mask. Of all the customers that shopped for beauty, 27% bought eye products,” said Uma Talreja, chief marketing and customer officer, Shoppers Stop.

MUMBAI: After recording a slight dip in Covid-19 infections for a few days, Mumbai has been back to adding over 1,000 cases each day for the past four days. The city saw 1,854 infections on Wednesday, with 1,350 and 1,217 the next two days. It added 1,432 cases on Saturday.Officials said they expect a surge in infections next week with Ganeshotsav coming to an end. “With travel curbs eased, many people have travelled to meet their families and have started returning. It is likely cases could increase,” a state official said.Local factors, too, could contribute to the increase, if it happens. A doctor at a civic hospital said nine officials of a Ganesh pandal in Parel tested positive last week. “People don’t observe social distancing norms or use face masks properly. If Mumbai witnesses a second wave, it would only be because of failure to adhere to such norms,” the doctor said.TOI spoke to the three leading Ganpati mandals of Lalbaug-Parel. It turns out all have had karyakartas or officials who have been afflicted by the virus “but since they have recovered, they are visiting pandals for brief durations”.Lalbaugcha Raja mandal president Balasaheb Kamble said, “We do not have a moorti this year so crowds are absent. But we have over 2,000 volunteers, and given the spread of the virus, it was natural some of them were infected. But after they tested negative, 30-40 returned to donate plasma at our health camp. We are careful to maintain social distancing and sanitise the health camp beds and furniture every hour.”A functionary at Ganesh Gully mandal had tested positive along with his family. “But he recovered two weeks ago,” said secretary Swapnil Parab. “Other karyakartas also tested positive but are doing well now and have completed the quarantine period. None of our workers is ill at present. Those who have recovered are back to work, but many only visit the mandap for brief periods. We check body temperature at the entrance,” he added.The spokesperson of the Chinchpokli Cha Chintamani mandal was treated for coronavirus and discharged on August 18. “I suffered from fever and tested positive for Covid-19. I was admitted to a hospital in Vikhroli and discharged. My family and I are observing 14-day isolation and wearing masks and gloves. I have now tested negative. I am only taking online darshan,” he said.BMC officials, however, said a surge in cases due to Ganpati festivities was unlikely. AMC Suresh Kakani said civic officials have not noticed any surge in areas near public pandals. “Our daily cases have remained steady at 1,200 cases on an average. We are testing more, and people are following rules of social distancin,” he said. A ward official from the suburbs said, ”Ganpati mandals are taking all the required precautions to avoid crowds. They allow only a few people into the pandals during prayers.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77829480,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-352336,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-19-mumbai-sees-over-1000-cases-for-4th-day-fears-of-a-spike-as-ganpati-ends/articleshow/77829482.cms

THANE/NAVI MUMBAI: As the Navi Mumbai Covid-19 tally went past the 25,000 mark with 391 new cases on Saturday, the Thane rural region distinguished itself with a recovery rate of over 82% and zero new cases for 28 days in over 51% of its gram panchayat jurisdictions.

These gram panchayats put up green flags in their villages as a display of consistency in fighting the coronavirus infection. “The weekly report taken earlier this week showed that out of the 430 gram panchayts in Thane rural, 221 have not reported Covid-19 patients in 28 days,” Chandrakant Pawar, Dy CEO, gram panchayat.

Murbad, Shahpur, Bhiwandi and Ambernath with a population of 3.64 lakh have so far recorded 9,048 positive cases, with 7,427 of them recovering and 290 deaths. Active cases number 1,331.

“So far there have been 1,338 containment zones. Out of these 337 are active while 1,001 have finished their 14-day quarantine period. There are 833 teams, which have visited 83,930 homes for checkup of people in the containment zones,” Pawar said.

Dr Manish Renge, district health officer, said two Covid-19 hospitals were being set up in Bhiwandi, at Ganeshpuri with 300 beds and in Sawad with 150 beds.

The district health department started antigen tests a fortnight ago and has conducted 1,858 tests, with 616 positive results.

Increased testing through rapid antigen test kits was cited as the reason for the rise in the Covid-19 tally to 25,384 in Navi Mumbai, where it took 15 days from August 14 onwards for the number to move up from 20,000 to 25,000.

The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) said all RT-PCR tests were now being conducted at its own lab, which has a capacity of 1,000 swab tests a day. It was also conducting doorstep antigen tests with 34 mobile vans, and 3,000 antigen tests were being conducted daily. There are 22 fever clinics.

The recovery rate has gone up to 84%, while it was 59% in June when the first 5,000 positive cases were reported. As many as 21,360 people have recovered.

With five deaths on Saturday, the toll rose to 576. The mortality rate declined from 3% in June to 2.26%. Active cases dwindled from 3,564 a fortnight ago to 3,448.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Residents of Bakkannapalem are showing opposition to the setting up of a gasifier crematorium facility to cremate people who die of Covid-19 in the area. Locals say that the facility should be located far away from their burial ground.

The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is planning to construct two such crematoriums to cremate people who die of Covid-19 at the earliest. While one of the crematoriums is slated to come up in Bakkannapalem near Madhurawada the other is supposed to come up at Pedagantyada near Gajuwaka.

The crematoriums, which will come up at an estimated cost of Rs 3.5 crore will have a burning platform, a mortuary, an administrative building, internal roads and water facility.

In this cremation process, no firewood will be used. The body will be put in a chamber or container in which flames of gas will burn the body in 40-45 minutes.

Speaking to TOI, PV Satya Prasad, a resident of Bakkannapalem said, “Why does the GVMC want to set up such a facility in this thickly-populated area? We will not allow this. They should shift the location. Otherwise we will start an agitation.”

Uma Sankar, another resident of the area, said that Bakkanapalem is a residential area and a school zone. “Around 3,500 school children, many retired people live here. This is also a green zone. We have already approached minister M Srinivasa Rao and GVMC authorities with our concerns,” Sankar said.

However, superintending engineer of GVMC’s engineering wing, Raju said that the construction of the crematorium will be completed in three months and it will not be harmful for the locals. “We will try to convince and create awareness,” he said.

If the manufacturers give the green signal, the stocks would be shifted from the bars and sold from neighbourhood wine shops soon.Since Oct 1 last year, after the government took over all wine stores across the state, popular brands started vanishing from the racks of state-run wine outlets and were replaced by unknown and locally produced brands. The popular brands were available only at star hotels, which was not affordable for most residents, especially the regular drinkers.“Following our requests, officials have started visiting the bar-cum-restaurants. They are matching batch number of the beer stocks and collecting two-three samples of every batch number. The samples would be sent to the manufacturers for testing purpose. If the manufacturers give the green signal, these beer stocks would be sold from government-run wine stores,” Prasanth Singu, president of Hotels & Restaurants Association of Andhra Pradesh , told TOI.Andhra Pradesh Beverage Corporation Limited (APBCL) officials said beer stocks at most bar-cum-restaurants are either on the verge of expiry or are already expired. “The collected samples have been sent to the manufacturers, who will test the quality of the stocks.

It will take around 10 to 15 days to get the report,” said a senior APBCL official.Experts in the field said there shouldn’t be any issues for the samples to get the clearance. In fact, though Andhra Pradesh allows an expiry date of six months from the date of manufacture, in states like West Bengal the expiry date is 12 months from the manufacturing date.“The main thing to ensure is that oxygen does not enter the bottles.

The process will start with an official meeting with residents of Bhavanapadu and Devunaltada— the two coastal villages that will be displaced by the project. The villages are located nearly 150km away from Vizag city.

Bhavanapadu, which comes under Palasa assembly segment, is represented in the assembly by state fisheries minister Seediri Appalaraju. Speaking to TOI, the fisheries minister said that 10,000 villagers, mostly fishermen, will have to vacate their villages for the project.

As per a tentative agreement, the government is looking to pay Rs 18 lakh to Rs 20 lakh per acre as compensation for the land acquired for the project. Further, the displaced people are also expected to get house sites, employment and pension.

“The project needs 2,217 acres of land. We are going to have a meeting with the villagers on September 5. Hopefully, the construction work for the project will begin by the end of this year,” said Appalaraju.

The port project was first proposed nearly eight years ago under the previous regime. But various factors including bifurcation stalled progress. The state government is keen on completing at least the first phase of the project at the earliest by developing four berths in 500 acres land.

Recently, the government approved the detailed project report (DPR) for the first phase of the project which will have an estimated cost of nearly Rs 3,670 crore, according to the fisheries minister.

The project is part of the state government plan to develop four non-major ports in the state to meet container cargo demand which is likely to go up to 300-350 million tonnes by 2025, said the minister.

A senior official based in Kakinada said that the Bhavanapadu port is one among the four proposed non-major ports. The state currently has 16 non-major ports and one major port— the Visakhapatnam port. The state government is expected to allot around Rs 261 crore towards land acquisition cost of 500 acres for the first phase of the project.

The civic body is currently conducting meetings with officials and staff to spread awareness about modification in weightage of various parameters of the survey.

The focus areas of the survey have evolved over the years. While the first survey in 2016 simply assessed physical progress, the 2020 survey evaluated the institutionalisation of cleanliness practices. The sixth survey, that of 2021, will focus adopt an integrated approach.

Indicators of the 2021 survey will focus on parameters pertaining to wastewater treatment and reuse along with faecal sludge. Legacy waste management and remediation of landfills will also act as crucial components under ‘service level progress’ category.

A new category, namely ‘Prerak Dauur Samman’ has been introduced as part of the 2021 survey to classify cities on six indicators.

Cities will be categorised as ‘platinum’, ‘gold’, ‘silver’, ‘bronze’ and ‘aspiring’ based on performance on select indicators. The new parameters will make cities focus on developing infrastructure that may provide end-to-end solution for sanitation.

In an effort to take citizen’s participation a notch higher, the 2021 survey indicators will consider the citizen-led innovations, including citizens, start-ups, Swachchata Champions and others in terms of their contribution to reduction of solid waste.

GVMC additional commissioner Dr V Sanyasi Rao said that the civic body is preparing an action plan so as to make it to the top-five in the 2021 survey. “GVMC has already started construction of a waste-to-energy plant and bio-mining at Kapuluppada dumpling yard. It will start working this October. All these factors will help the city get five-star rating in the ‘certification’ category and improve overall ranking ,” Rao said.

He added that the civic body has already held a meeting with Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs), NGOs and other stakeholders as citizen participation is going to be a crucial component of Swachh Survekshan-2021.

KOLKATA: The Bengal government is likely to issue a fresh notification on complete lockdown in the state following Saturday evening’s Unlock 4 order by the Union home ministry that prohibits states from imposing any local lockdown outside containment zones without prior consultation with the Centre.

Following the new order, the issue came up for discussion during a review of the state’s Covid situation between CM Mamata Banerjee and chief secretary Rajeeva Sinha. The state has been observing intermittent ‘total lockdowns’ since July-end to “break the chain of Covid infection”. It has already observed three such shutdowns in July and five more in August while the sixth and last lockdown of August is scheduled for Monday. The government has already announced three lockdown dates for the coming month — September 7, 11 and 12.

Sources said the notifica-tion announcing the September dates is likely to be scrapped and a fresh notification issu-ed after discussions with the Centre.

The Unlock 4 guidelines also reiterated that there shall be no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods, and no separate permission/e-permit will be required for such movements. Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla had five days ago written to all chief secretaries, stating that such restrictions amount to violation of guidelines issued by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) under provisions of Disaster Management Act, 2005.

The state government had on July 21 announced the twice-a-week total lockdowns on the advice of experts who had stressed on the need to “break the chain of infection”. The state has till now registered 1.6 lakh Covid cases and 3,126 deaths.

Concerns over the Covid situation had also prompted the state government to ban flights from six Covid hotspot cities in July. On Thursday, the government announced that the restriction will be eased from next month when flights from the six cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Nagpur and Ahmedabad — will be allowed to fly into Kolkata three times a week.

Our attention will be put on checking aimless movement of people.”Federation of Jharkhand Chambers of Commerce and Industries president Kunal Ajmani said the administration should desist from making the business houses a soft target while implementing the norms. “While the administration is sealing shops for small faults like failure in maintaining visitors’ register, no action is being taken against people who crowd the streets,” Ajmani said.",ranchi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-admin-takes-anti-covid-measures-as-fresh-unlock-phase-begins/articleshow/77827409.cms
443,['30/08/2020'],‘Gujarat’ man’s body found in canal near B’desh border,"Kolkata: The recovery of a 24-year-old man’s body, along with an Aadhaar card of Gujarat, in Vidyadhari Canal near the India-Bangladesh border has senior BSF officers foxed.

Efforts are on to ascertain if Shaikh Imaran (as named in the Aadhaar card) travelled to Ghojadanga in North 24 Parganas for work or was an illegal immigrant with valid Indian documents. Over the past few weeks, BSF troops have apprehended several illegal immigrants from Bangladesh with Indian IDs.

“We found the body in the canal near ICP Ghojadanga around 7.10am on Friday during routine patrolling. Troops of 153Bn spotted something floating in the canal and followed it downstream. The body got stuck on the banks and was retrieved. Local villagers failed to identify the youth. His body was handed over to police who found a diary and the Aadhaar card,” a senior BSF officer of South Bengal Frontier said.

According to the Aadhaar card, Imaran was the son of one Shaikh Badshahbhai, a resident of Ahmedabad. The cause of death could not be ascertained. Basirhat police are speaking to their counterparts in Ahmedabad.

“A thorough investigation is needed. We have evidence that illegal immigrants from Bangladesh are in the country with valid IDs. Recently, we caught several women who were trafficked to India years ago and now possess Aadhaar, PAN and even Election Photo Identity Cards. Such people are normally nabbed when they try to cross the International Border illegally to visit relatives in Bangladesh or attempt to return after such visits. Such people are a great security risk if they are able to so easily procure identity documents,” the official added.

445,['30/08/2020'],Govt allows only 6 pvt hosps in Jharkhand to conduct antigen tests,"Picture for representational purpose only.

RANCHI: The state health department on Saturday issued an order, restricting the non-NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers) and the non-NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) private hospitals from conducting the rapid antigen tests on Covid-19 patients.

The order states that as per the ICMR guidelines, only those private hospitals that are affiliated to NABH and NABL can conduct the rapid antigen tests.

Going by the aforementioned criteria, only six private hospitals — two in Jamshedpur, three in Ranchi and one in Seraikela-Kharsawan — are allowed to conduct the rapid antigen tests. The six hospitals include Tata Main Hospital and Tata Motors Hospital in Jamshedpur, Raj Hospital, Medanta Hospital and Santevita Hospital in Ranchi and Bramhananda Narayana Multispeciality Hospital in Seraikela Kharsawan.

“These hospitals which have been allowed to conduct the rapid tests should follow the conditions laid down by the state health department and the ICMR in letter and in spirit. The swab samples should be collected through RT-PCR and all results must be updated on the CVV portal. The ICMR code for every test result has to be generated and information regarding the test results must be passed on to the civil surgeon of the district concerned and the state IDSP unit,” the order read.

The government direction has not gone down well with the private hospitals as many of them are yet to obtain the NABH certification.

Association of Healthcare Providers India ( Jharkhand ) president Jogesh Gambhir said the restriction would lead to delay in the treatment of patients and may lead to the further spread of coronavirus. “If private hospitals can treat the Covid-19 patients, why do they need to be affiliated to NABH to conduct the tests,” he added.

Gambhir pointed out that in other states, the government has procured the test kits and distributed it to the private hospitals for free to ensure that maximum number of tests are conducted. “In Jharkhand, for reasons best known to the authorities, they are restricting the tests even when the private hospitals are willing to do it after purchasing the kit on their own,” he said.

The association offered that in case the government is suspicious about the maintenance of data, a government representative can be stationed in the private hospitals to collect the data and update it on the ICMR portal on a regular basis.

The vice president (operations) at Bhagwan Mahavir Medica Superspecialty Hospital here, Anil Kumar, said that in the wake of the pandemic their application for NABH certification is pending before the council. “Rapid antigen test would have helped us in the immediate management of patients because it gives results within half an hour,” he added.

446,['30/08/2020'],Ranchi police struggle to maintain social distancing in lock-ups,"Ranchi: With the police stations having limited number of lockups for keeping the accused persons, ensuring social distancing norms among them is proving to be a challenge for the cops.

In several police stations, the accused are being kept in barracks under the surveillance of security guards. The empty women’s locks ups are also housing the men in order to maintain the social distancing norms.

The challenge is even greater for small police stations like Sadar, Hindpiri, Tupudana and Nagri. For instance, Tupudana station has only one lockup and its officers have no other option but to request the other police stations to keep their accused persons in order to maintain the safety norms.

An officer posted in Sadar police station said that the difficulties crop up when four or more criminals are nabbed and keeping them in a single room may lead to the spread of Covid-19. Citing an example, he said that recently four criminals were caught with a cheque worth Rs 56.42 crore and one of them tested positive, sending the entire police force in a tizzy.

In many cases, police are keeping the accused in different rooms within the police stations.

City SP Saurav said, “We try to maintain social distancing norms as far as possible. If the number of accused is huge, we keep them in other rooms within the police stations where the cops can keep a watch. In some cases, the accused are shifted to other police stations which have more number of rooms.”

A similar situation exists in the neighbouring district of Khunti. “We keep the accused persons in different areas within the police stations and if required, even shift them to other police stations. We also try to make sure that the accused wear masks all the time,” said SP Ashutosh Shekhar.

I left the house with my daughter and later filed a case, which is yet to be heard due to the pandemic. With my parents’ support (they agreed to stay with me), my focus all these years has been on my work and my daughter. Due to this pandemic, I’m having guilt pangs for marrying outside my community (it was a love marriage) and troubling my parents in their old age. I am afraid about my daughter’s future and that’s affecting my work and confidence. Please help.

I am a housewife living with my husband and two grown-up children. In January, I discovered an intimate WhatsApp chat between him and his female colleague. He said the intimacy was not beyond the chat and that they have mutually agreed to part. In March, I was moving into a mild depression and started chatting with my husband's married ex-colleague whom we have known for many years. I found his talk very comforting and soon got intimate over chats. Unfortunately, around May his wife found out and got very angry. She now calls up and abuses me. I did not tell my husband until recently. He heard patiently and said we need to come out of this so that both families can move on. But I am very stressed. How can I get past this?

Anonymous, stressed wife

I am a PG student studying at the open school and preparing for government jobs. I really want to change my attitude towards life and my career but I feel stuck and have no motivation. I wanted to do something else but wasn't allowed. Next my family talked me into preparing for jobs during my undergrad. I struggled with studies - jumping from job to grad syllabus and back. I didn't score well in my graduation. Now it feels like I don't know how to study at all. I try so hard to understand things but there's no progress. Last year, I tried to talk to my parents about my mental health and how I feel like a mess all the time. They aren't aware of mental health and didn't consider what I said and instead scolded me. After that, I never shared my feelings with them. I don't have friends. I have no emotional support. I feel so depressed, exhausted and negative all the time. Sometimes I get suicidal thoughts too and I know I can't do it. I think that I have ruined my life due to others’ expectations. I don't want to live like this. All I want is to be happy, loved and to have a reputed career. Can you help me get out of this mess ?

It is important to start from the basics. This includes first trying to ensure that you are following a routine and this should match the schedule of your classes. Ensure that you do not skip classes. It can be difficult to focus on an online platform for long so it is important to make it more engaging for yourself. An easy way of doing this is to ensure you actively take notes during class. This would also ensure that you are processing and reinforcing what is being taught. Make sure that the space you are using is uncluttered so you can focus on what is being taught. In the late afternoon or early evening, go over your notes and put away your gadgets for that time period. Do this regularly at a fixed time so you are able to accommodate this as a part of your routine. These simple strategies can go a long way in enhancing your focus and as you begin to do better in your academic pursuits, your motivation too would build which would act as an automatic reinforcer.These difficult times are somehow providing individuals the time and space to be able to look back on and assess the choices they have made. It is important that in order to maintain your positivity and optimism, you try to learn from all the experiences you have had. Looking back and getting pulled into thoughts of what could have been is rather unhelpful. Instead look towards understanding yourself, what you need today and the steps you can take to build a wonderful future for your daughter and yourself. Remember the steps you have taken in the past few years to give your daughter a good life . Your parents' support is reflective of the belief they have in you. These are reminders for maintaining your positivity. Ground yourself in the present and keep pushing yourself to look at what you can control and change today. This is a skill that requires practice and with consistent effort you will certainly be able to build an approach that is forward looking.Our relationship with our family members is crucial to how we come to view ourselves. The fact that you have a difficult and toxic relationship with your parents would understandably be causing an impact on your well-being and sense of self. However, there is correspondingly a need to also be able to rely on what you have understood about them and their relationship with you over the years. An attempt needs to be made consistently to steer yourself away from the thoughts which mirror what they demonstrate towards you – that you are not good enough or that you cannot be trusted. You need to try and shift your focus towards other significant adults or relationships in your life which have been supportive and have reinforced the strengths you have and the goodness that you possess. This would allow you to create a balance in your own mind in the ways you view yourself and how it affects your moods and thought processes. Consider working with a psychologist or reach out to a helpline.In the midst of a situation such as this, many thoughts, doubts and questions can come to mind. It is important you make a proactive attempt to work through these. This is critical to ensuring that you are able to work through the challenges that your marital life is going through. This would involve an active process of rebuilding the trust that has been lost, while continuing to communicate in order to determine what led to the situations you currently find yourselves in as a couple. You need to utilise this situation as an opportunity to introspect about your relationship with your husband. It is important to attempt to determine what could have potentially led you to make the choices you did, what role was played by each individual and the manner in which you would like to move forward. Acknowledge, accept and take responsibility for your actions and also take the more proactive stance in working towards enhancing communication and rebuilding trust with each other. This can be facilitated with the help of an expert, who through the utilization of a neutral stance and specific techniques would be able to help both of you individually and as a couple create a dynamic that restores your relationship if you would like to work towards the same.This can be a rather difficult situation to find yourself in, particularly as you are trying to equip yourself with the right knowledge and skills to work towards building a good future. The impact this has had on your well-being can make it difficult to maintain an optimistic outlook that would also involve taking a problem solving approach. Even though currently you may not be sharing your emotional and psychological experiences with your family, it would be helpful to consider staying in communication with some friends so that you do not feel alone and isolated. You should first start by addressing the mental health related concerns that are emerging and consider meeting with a psychiatrist or a psychologist who can help you assess what intervention may be required currently. Once you have done this begin by assessing the changes you need to bring about and start taking small steps towards doing so. Break it down into smaller parts, as looking at and approaching a big situation is always far more difficult. In these times, try to see if you can also stay connected with a friend or family member who can be a source of support. This will help bolster your comfort and confidence, allowing you to take the necessary steps you desire in reaching the goals of happiness, love and success at work.Want some advice ?Sharing can help your recovery so write to us at talkitout@timesgroup.com with your question, name and place.

449,['30/08/2020'],"Unlock 4: Will work out final details with Bengal govt, says metro GM","KOLKATA: Metro services in Kolkata may resume in a restricted manner from September 7 after remaining suspended for over five months. The ministry of home affairs (MHA), on Friday issued guidelines for Unlock 4 in which Metro has been allowed to operate from September 7 in a graded manner. There are no instructions for resumption of suburban or regular long-distance rail services though.“We have gone through the guidelines and will discuss the matter with the ministry of railways. As soon as we receive instructions from the ministry of railways, we will start working on a plan to resume services. If the ministry of housing and urban affairs issues standard operating procedures by then, as has been mentioned in the MHA guidelines, we will also go through them. Finally, we will sit with the West Bengal government to work out the final details,” Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi told TOI.On Friday, state home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay had written to Railway Board chairman Vinod Kumar, seeking a phased resumption of Metro and suburban railway services. “State government is of the view that Metro and local train services can be resumed in Bengal in a limited manner maintaining the norms of physical distancing and health hygiene protocols,” Bandyopadhyay wrote. He also asked the Railway Board to “work out the modalities and logistics” of resumption of services “in consultation with the state”.Metro Railway has kept its assets ready to resume commercial services at short notice. It has also been running special services to enable staff to reach stations for maintenance work. When commercial operations resume, it is likely to be only be for existing smart-card holders as handling of tokens may compromise on hygiene. To enable hands-free operations, Metro has also launched online recharging facilities for smart cards.Explaining why the housing and urban affairs ministry has been asked to prepare SOPs for Metro operations and not the railway ministry, an official in Kolkata said that the urban affairs ministry has a stake in all Metros across the country except the one in Kolkata. The West Bengal government will be happy with this decision by the MHA as Metro Railway is considered the ‘lifeline’ of Kolkata. With offices and businesses opening, people are finding it difficult to commute safely as buses are crowded. Issues such as social distancing will certainly be discussed when Metro and state government officials meet. This meeting is crucial as chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier accused the railways of taking a “unilateral decision” to run trains to Bengal from states with higher Covid-19 counts. Even the number of special trains being run by Eastern and South Eastern Railway was brought down after this.A state proposal to resume phased Metro services from July 1 didn’t get the go ahead from Delhi earlier. Chief secretary Rajiva Sinha had then written to Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla urging for limited Metro services particularly for people engaged in essential services. But the MHA didn’t allow the services in view of the surge in the Covid graph in Bengal.This time, too, Metro officials worry over resuming services since the underground section is a confined space. Health experts have indicated that large gatherings (even 50-100 people) at close proximity in confined spaces can have disastrous consequences. There is also the issue of crowd management. This will have to be sorted out during the meeting with the state government as manpower will be an issue.Railway officials in Kolkata heaved a sigh of relief that the guidelines have nothing on resumption of suburban rail services. Crowd management at wayside suburban railway stations remains a bother for them. “We are running some local trains for our staff. There are repeated requests from certain circles, such as bank officials and state government employees to accommodate them in these trains. But we can’t take a decision without clearance from the Railway Board. It will also be impossible to maintain social distancing at wayside suburban stations that are not designed to restrict people from accessing platforms,” a railway official said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77830806,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-128574,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/will-work-out-final-details-with-bengal-govt-metro-gm/articleshow/77829224.cms
450,['30/08/2020'],RMO shortage at Kolkata private hospitals hits Covid-fight plans,"KOLKATA: A dearth of trained resident medical officers (RMO), who can handle the increased Covid-induced pressure on ICUs, has hit private hospitals hard, forcing many to cancel or defer plans of adding beds. While some have employed their senior specialists to serve at ICUs, others are recruiting young doctors from their own training programmes, but still finding it difficult to meet the requirement.According to hospitals, the RMOs are crumbling under the additional pressure. Many have tested Covid-positive while serving patients over the last five months, leaving the rest with yet more workload.Several stressed-out RMOs have gone on leave and some are even considering quitting the profession, according to a senior specialist at a private hospital. “Since it’s a skilled job that requires handling life-support systems, drugs and taking on-the-spot decisions, RMOs are not easy to replace. You need at least four-five years’ experience to function efficiently in an ICU. There is a shortage, which has grown after the pandemic left all ICUs full,” he said.Dearth of trained critical-care RMOs stopped AMRI Hospitals from extending its HDU beds. “We have over 60 Covid critical-care beds across our three units, but not enough RMOs,” said AMRI Hospitals CEO Rupak Barua. “We have more than 60 Covid critical-care beds across our three units (at Salt Lake, Mukundapur and Dhakuria), but not enough RMOs,” said AMRI Hospitals CEO Rupak Barua. “The constant flow of critical patients, together with the fact that many of our RMOs have tested positive over the last four months, has led to a shortage. We are ready to add more HDU beds but don’t have RMOs to serve these additional patients.”Baruah added that it was difficult to recruit more RMOs for ICUs, since they are mostly trained on the job. Some private hospitals run their own DNB (Diplomate in National Board) courses in broad specialities like general surgery, emergency, anaesthesiology as well as cardiology and critical care, which form a supply line of RMOs, but they are not enough in the current scenario.Since they need to handle skilled jobs like operating invasive and non-invasive ventilators, high-flow nasal canula (HFNC) and incubators, which can’t be done by the rest, RMOs can’t be easily replaced, said Fortis Hospital pulmonologist Raja Dhar. “No hospital has enough of them to take the present load,” he said.RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), for instance, runs courses in multiple disciplines that have helped the hospital tide over the crisis partially. “Our DNB students are taking care of patients under the supervision of senior consultants. While our Anandapur and Howrah units have more or less an adequate number of RMOs, the Barasat unit is facing a crisis, forcing us to handle the situation on a day-to-day basis,” said RTIICS zonal director R Venkatesh.At Medica Superspecialty Hospital, specialists from general wards have been moved to the Covid ICU to handle the additional load. The hospital has added more than 40 critical care beds over the last six weeks, taking the total to 100. It’s also employing its DNB students to assist RMOs at the ICU. “Since the number of Covid patients at the general ward has slid, we have moved some specialists like anaesthetists and critical care from there to the ICU. We have around 60 RMOs now, which is adequate, but we can’t have more beds,” said chairperson Alok Roy.Others have been forced to extend the working hours for RMOs after several tested Covid-positive. It has been leaving them even more drained, according to Kumar Raj, head of emergency, ILS Hospital. “We have six ICU RMOs, three each are working on a 12-hour shift now. Several have tested positive, and once an RMO falls ill, others are having to work on multiple shifts, which is strenuous. It’s leaving them stressed and fatigued,” said Raj, adding that they are often on duty for two days at a stretch.Several RMOs at ILS are staying away from their families for weeks, fearing they might infect their kin, added Raj. “RMOs are the most important part of the Covid treatment team in hospitals, especially for critical patients. They are the ones who are present inside the ICU round-the-clock and have to act in an emergency. Their role has become extremely important in the Covid scenario. We need more RMOs to relieve the stress on those on duty.”Another intensivist added that many RMOs had gone on leave, failing to bear the work pressure. “It’s relentless, and unlike consultants, they are on the job every minute. Any decision they take is critical and they are always in the line of fire.

MIDNAPORE: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) questioned PCPA-turned-Trinamool Congress leader Chhatradhar Mahato for the second consecutive day on Saturday, this time about PCPA activists laying siege to the Bhubaneswar Rajdhani Express at Banstala railway halt in Jhargram in October 2009, reports Sujoy Khanra.

The investigators quizzed Mahato at the Salboni Cobra camp, a day after he was interrogated in an 11-year-old Lalgarh murder case.

Mahato told the NIA team that he had no hand in the incident because it happened after police took him into custody.

453,['30/08/2020'],Unnao MP Sakshi Maharaj put in 14-day quarantine in Giridih,"Bokaro: BJP’s Unnao (Uttar Pradesh) MP Sakshi Maharaj was put in 14-day institutional quarantine in Giridih, about 220km from Ranchi, by the police on Saturday morning. A team led by Giridih SDO Prerna Dixit apprehended his vehicle near Pirtand police station while he was on way to Dhanbad to board a Delhi-bound Rajdhani.

The MP arrived in Giridih earlier in the morning and spent two hours with his ailing 97-year-old mother at Shanti Bhawan ashram. He was on his way back when he was stopped by the team, which cited government norms and put him under quarantine at the same ashram.

While Maharaj accused the JMM-Congress-RJD government quarantined him forcefully, Giridih DC Rahul Kumar Sinha said, “Sakshi Maharaj has been quarantined for 14 days as per the guidelines issued by state government on July 17. Those entering Jharkhand by road or train from must remain in quarantine for 14 days. I only acted as per instruction of my superiors.”

Maharaj said, “I had sent a fax to the chief secretary, the DGP and the DC and SP in Giridih on Thursday informing them about my visit. Had they objected to my visit or told me about the quarantine rules, I would not have come here. I told the DC that I have to attend a high-level meeting of a Parliament standing committee in which important bills have to be passed, but he refused to release me. The JMM-led government has acted against me only because I belong to BJP and I will lodge a complaint with the parliamentary Committee”

While, the state government said Maharaj had not inform the authorities about his visit, BJP accused JMM led government of acting unethically. “Forcibly putting Maharaj in quarantine is a politically motivated action taken by the Giridih administration,” P N Singh, BJP MP from Dhanbad, said.

On Friday, an FIR was lodged against RJD chief Lalu Yadav’s elder son and former Bihar health minister Tej Pratap Yadav for violating lockdown rules in Ranchi. Tej Pratap, who was in Ranchi to meet his father on Thursday, has been charged with entering Jharkhand without giving proper information to the authorities and not following quarantine norms.

454,['30/08/2020'],"Eye on coal project, Bengal lifts land purchase embargo","West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee

KOLKATA/SURI: The Bengal government has withdrawn the financial embargo on land acquisition and purchase, which it had imposed earlier as a part of an austerity drive.

The embargo was lifted a week ago as CM Mamata Banerjee wishes to flag off the Deucha Panchami coal project in Birbhum before the 2021 assembly polls. The coal block has a reserve of 2.1 billion tonnes and the project is likely to create jobs for 1 lakh people.

On April 2, the state had made it clear that it would not undertake any new project. However, the embargo has been withdrawn “in public interest” and considering the finance department will give its nod, an official said.

Banerjee had sent chief secretary Rajiva Sinha on a field visit to Deucha Panchami in July, apparently to assess possible bottlenecks, including how acquisition hurdles could be bypassed. Sinha had held meetings with villagers and assured them of a rehabilitation/resettlement package.

Mining activity in the coal block is expected to boost Birbhum’s economy and it will be the biggest industrial project before the 2021 polls. The Centre had granted allocation to Bengal in September 2019 and the state government is planning to mine 11,222.5 acres in phases. A Nabanna official said the government planned to begin land purchase/acquisition after Durga Puja.

The state has already formed Bengal Birbhum Coalfields Limited (BBCL) to anchor the project under the Power Development Corporation. A Nabanna official said investments to the tune of Rs 15,000 crore were needed to develop the coal block and a huge chunk of it would be spent on land acquisition and development.

Neither tribal land owners nor non-tribals are enthusiastic about handing over their ancestral plots to the government, prompting the latter to mull special rehabilitation packages. Anticipating resistance, the state is also planning to employ a section of local land owners.

The mouzas that are expected to be largely affected are Hatgacha, Chanda, Alinagar, Harinsingha, Nischintapur, Ddewanganj, Bahadurganj, Kabilnagar, Saluka and Makdumnagar. A senior official said all villagers “who are living on project land will be rehabilitated and the CM has made it clear that there will be no forcible acquisition”. A land official refused to give an exact estimate of acres needed, saying “the government wants to progress in phases”.

A member of Panchami Mine Owners Association said, “We are not against coal mining here, but demand adequate compensation for stone units and their labourers.”

455,['30/08/2020'],BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya raises President's rule demand,"BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya

HEMTABAD: BJP national general secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya wants the 2021 assembly elections in Bengal to be held under President’s Rule. He is the first among BJP leaders to openly voice such a demand.

“Holding of free and fair elections is not possible under Mamata Banerjee ’s rule. The state administration is being run by a group of partisan and corrupt officials. We have already appealed to the President to seek reports from the West Bengal governor. Elections in this state should be conducted under President’s Rule,” Vijayvargiya said in Uttar Dinajpur on Saturday.

During the day, a BJP delegation led by the national general secretary reached out to the family of the party’s Hemtabad MLA Debendra Nath Roy, whose body was found hanging outside a closed shop more than a month ago on July 13, one-and-a-half kilometres from his residence.

BJP and the MLA’s widow have sought a CBI inquiry into what they called was a “premeditated murder” when the primary autopsy report stated that the injury was “ante-mortem”. The state police, however, held that it could be a “suicide”.

State BJP leaders rubbished the state police version and petitioned President Ram Nath Kovind the very next day, on July 14, showcasing the BJP MLA’s unnatural death as a continuation of the long series of “political killings” under Banerjee’s rule in Bengal.

“Democracy has been hanged in West Bengal. Political workers were being killed so far, and now elected leaders are being murdered and shown to have committed suicide. Anarchy prevails in the state, and its government has no right to be in power... We have demanded that the assembly be dissolved,” Vijayvargiya had said after meeting the President.

BJP leaders complained that as many as 105 BJP activists have been killed in the state in the last three years. Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar called on Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi six days later on July 20 to brief him about the state’s law and order situation.

Vijayvargiya’s demand for President’s Rule comes a day after state BJP president Dilip Ghosh left it to the Election Commission to conduct free and fair polls in Bengal in the due course of time.

456,['30/08/2020'],Three senior Visva-Bharati officials dismissed from service,"SANTINIKETAN: Visva-Bharati has dismissed three senior officials of which two are faculty members. The VB executive council in its meeting on Saturday removed former officiating vice-chancellor Sabujkali Sen, former officiating registrar Sougata Chattopadhyay and former finance officer and Botany professor Samit Roy from service.

The EC decision has been communicated to them via mail. Sen got the “removal from service” mail two days ahead of her retirement on Monday.

The VB EC cracked the whip based on the recommendations of former Calcutta high court Chief Justice Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, who proposed the ultimate punishment after going through the report of an UGC-appointed committee with Prime Minister’s nominee Dulal Ghosh as member.

One among the three dismissed said: “The university didn’t give us enough time to submit papers in our defence. The decision was pre-fixed. And the so-called investigation is just an eyewash. We will move court.”

The UGC appointed the Dulal Ghosh Committee to look into the alleged tampering of the Visva-Bharati EC resolution No. 2 of the February 17, 2018 meeting. The accused had allegedly tampered with the recording of the resolution in the minute book in a bid to extend Sen’s tenure as director to give her an edge in the race of getting the officiating vice-chancellor’s post.

The three were suspended on June13, 2020 after the EC found prima facie substance in the allegations.

Accordingly, Visva-Bharati appointed a one-man committee under former Calcutta high court Chief Justice Jyotirmoy Bhattacahrya to propose the quantum of punishment against the three who were found guilty in the Dulal Ghosh committee report.

457,['30/08/2020'],Trump surveys Hurricane Laura damage in post-convention trip,"LAKE CHARLES: President Donald Trump got a firsthand look Saturday at the damage from Hurricane Laura on a post-Republican National Convention trip that allowed him to use the trappings of his office to try to project empathy and leadership.His stops, first in Louisiana and later in Texas, came two days after the Category 4 storm slammed the Gulf Coast, leaving at least 16 dead and wreaking havoc with severe winds and flooding. While the storm surge has receded and the cleanup effort has begun, hundreds of thousands remain without power or water, and they could for weeks or months as the hot summer stretches on.""I'm here to support the great people of Louisiana. It's been a great state for me,'' he said in Lake Charles. ""It was a tremendously powerful storm."" He said he knows one thing about the state: ""They rebuild it fast.""During the slightly more than two hours he spent in the city, Trump met with officials and relief workers but not with any of the residents whose homes had been ripped apart in the storm.He did, however, get a good look at the extensive damage and the debris strewn across the city of 80,000 people, beginning with the bird's eye view from Air Force One as it came in for landing.His first stop was a warehouse being used as a staging area for the Cajun Navy, a group of Louisiana volunteers who help with search and rescue after hurricanes and floods. ""Good job,"" Trump told them.Trump then toured a neighborhood with Gov. John Bel Edwards and acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, making his way down a street blocked by felled trees and where houses were battered by the storm, one with its entire roof torn off.Edwards has said Laura was the most powerful hurricane ever to strike his state, surpassing even Hurricane Katrina, which was a Category 3 when it hit almost exactly 15 years ago.""Whether you come from Louisiana or 5th Avenue In New York, you know about Katrina,"" Trump said.The president then flew by helicopter to Orange, Texas , which was the worst-hit area in the state. Several hundred supporters greeted his arrival with Trump 2020 flags, banners and signs. Among the officials on hand were Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Before a tour by air over damaged areas, Trump and other officials visited the emergency operations center in Orange County to discuss storm damage and the government response.Trump has sometimes struggled with his role as consoler in chief, failing to project empathy when visiting places hard hit by tragedy and disaster. That includes in Puerto Rico, where Trump was photographed tossing rolls of paper towel into the crowd, which some saw as inappropriately playful, given the circumstances. During a trip to the Carolinas in 2018, Trump marveled at a yacht floodwaters had washed onto a family's property, telling them, ""At least you got a nice boat out of the deal."" And he was caught on camera telling a person he'd handed out food to ""have a good time.""Other times, Trump has been a source of comfort. After a tornado ripped through Alabama last year, killing nearly two dozen people, Trump spent time with families who'd lost loved ones, listening to their stories and hugging them.Showing empathy has come more naturally for his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, who issued a statement Saturday saying he and his wife were praying for those hurt by the storm and promising that ""we will be there to help you build back better.""In a possible subtle dig at the incumbent, Biden praised the response of families in the hurricane-hit states and thanked them for ""reminding Americans that no disaster, no single person, no injustice can match the humble, personal, courageous ways that Americans choose decency every single day.""Laura, which packed 150-mph (240-kph) winds and a storm surge as high as 15 feet (4.5 meters), toppled trees and damaged buildings as far north as central Arkansas. More than 580,000 coastal residents evacuated in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.More than half of those who died succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning from the unsafe operation of generators.

Sathe resumed work on August 11, a day after the recommendation was made.Sunil Ramanand, additional director general of police, prisons, on August 10 sent a letter to Sanjay Chahande, additional chief secretary (prisons), recommending Sathe’s suspension.Sources in the prison department said Sathe was posted as DIG headquarters in Pune and was transferred as DIG prisons (east region) in Nagpur on June 15.A senior officer said she did not join duty immediately during the pandemic when a number of Covid-19 positive cases were being reported from various jails. “On July 4, as many as 42 prisoners and 56 jail staffers tested positive for Covid-19 in the Nagpur jail. Anil Deshmukh, state home minister, and Ramanand had visited the Nagpur jail, but Sathe had till then not joined duty as DIG in Nagpur,” said the jail official.Ramanand wrote a letter to Sathe on July 6 asking her to resume duty immediately. On July 13, Sathe joined duty as DIG (east region). Sources further said that on August 7, Sathe sought leave and proceeded on leave without getting it sanctioned from senior officials. The source said Sathe had allegedly “shown open defiance to the transfer order and not resumed office for a long time even during the pandemic and ran away from her job in complete dereliction of duty.”On August 11, Deepak Pandey, inspector general of police (prisons), issued summons to Sathe asking her to appear before him to record her statement related to her leave.

I was on leave for a couple of days and have submitted a medical certificate. I am on duty,” she said.Pandey, confirming he was conducting a preliminary enquiry and had issued summons to Sathe, said, “The matter is under inquiry.

He has also asked them to expedite the test results. The state tested 80,988 samples on Saturday, a record in the five months of Covid management.In his four-hour-long video conference with the district collectors, the chief minister reviewed the districts one by one. Adequate awareness should be created for those with symptoms of fever, cold, dry cough, wheezing, tiredness, head ache and loss of smell and taste reach hospitals in 24 hours, he said. ""The chief minister expressed concerns over spike in Covid cases in Coimbatore, Cuddalore, Salem, Vellore, Chengalpet and Tiruvallur districts. They have to adopt a focus strategy to bring down the cases,"" said a senior official. These districts have to map the affected areas, hold fever camps and mount surveillance involving non-government organisations and tests to clean up the affected regions, said the official.Government sources said the chief minister was considering more relaxations to revive the economy. It needs to be clubbed with strict action to curb the disease. Districts like Cuddalore, Tiruvannamalai and Tiruvarur were told to increase tests because the positivity rate was high in those areas. Certain districts were asked to set up screening centres to send the symptomatic to Covid hospitals and health centres and asymptomatic to Covid care centres..The state government has spent 7,162 crore towards Covid control, treatment and relief measures so far. ""Spike in cases in the western belt is attributed to the opening of industries. The chief minister was particular about the workers getting tested and the factories being visited by a team of labour department and local body authorities,"" another official said.The government feels that abolishing e-pass and movement of public transport would complicate the disease control measures. The chief minister is also strongly advocating the use of e-pass to trace the contacts. On Saturday, a specific direction was issued to Greater Chennai Corporation to put in place measures to control hike in cases once e-pass relaxations are announced. While unveiling ""Unlock 4.0"" guidelines, the Union home ministry said there ""shall be no restriction"" on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods. No separate permission/approval/e-permit will be required for such movements. But the state government does not subscribe to this thought.Quoting study reports, Palaniswami sought to convey that the state was recovering speedily from the economic impact due to Covid-19, with various welfare measures being implemented by the state.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77829594,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-105575,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/give-priority-to-the-elderly-speed-up-covid-tests-tamil-nadu-cm/articleshow/77829589.cms

A year ago on the very same day at the same time of writing – 6:30 AM – lakhs of people across the Telugu states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh cued up to watch Sujeeth ’s Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor starrer Saaho While ‘benefit shows’ weren’t allowed in Telangana, the hysteria began from midnight itself in Andhra Pradesh with the earliest shows. Fans all over the Telugu states (even the world) cued up for days before to get the precious ticket for FDFS (first day first show) and haggled with Prabhas’ fan clubs since days in the hope of catching their favourite star on-screen after two years. Alas, tickets were sold out promptly, and those who couldn’t bag a coveted ticket still stood on the sidelines hoping to get one even in ‘black’ outside single screen theatres, for hiked up prices that went up to Rs 1500 and more on a ticket that cost Rs 300 or less.Fans thronged to theatres hours before the first show would even begin, decorating the single screens with banners and cut-outs of Prabhas, with some even lovingly performing palabhisekam and adorning them with garlands as if he were really there. Ticker sellers locked themselves in the box office room as fans wouldn’t stop beating on the door yelling, “Sir okka ticket sir, please sir,” even as they yelled from inside, “Sold out andi! Chepte ardham kaada?” Sounds like a massive exaggeration, but this was truly the case a year ago.And if this was the case outside the theatre, the scene inside during the opening show was a whole another ballgame. Screams and confetti galore, fans didn’t seem to care what reviewers were live Tweeting or naysayers were saying – they were only interested in dancing their hearts out to Bad Boy as Prabhas and Jacqueling Fernandez showed off their moves on-screen.With theatres remaining shut during the Covid-19 pandemic and many movie buffs missing the rush that comes along with watching the FDFS of a huge star at a single screen (no matter the outcome of the film), take a look at these throwback pictures and videos fans posted a year ago on the opening day of Saaho:",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77826985,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1445753/77826985.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/telugu/movies/news/1yearofbomonstersaaho-throwback-to-the-fdfs-of-prabhas-and-shraddha-kapoor-starrer-saaho/articleshow/77826985.cms
474,['30/08/2020'],Karnataka: Hospitals can use cadaver organs for own patients,"Representative image

BENGALURU: With no cadaver donations since the last week of March when the lockdown was announced till last week of August, the government has tweaked organ donation allocation criteria.

Now, a hospital with a brain-dead patient can retrieve organs and transplant them to patients undergoing treatment at the same facility.

The move, which may boost organ retrievals, is a Uturn by Jeevasarthakathe, the cadaver organ donation coordinating unit of the state government, which had, in February, scrapped in-house allocation for hospitals as it sensed foul play.

Suspecting some hospital chains had formed a cartel with smaller health centres to get patients on the verge of being declared brain dead, the government had withdrawn the special allocation preference conferred on hospitals in this regard. The move was largely opposed by all stakeholders.

We’ve temporarily relaxed criteria to encourage organ donations: Official

After the February decision, there were five donations till mid-March. But since March-end, there have been no cadaver transplants. The first was a brain-dead plumber whose organs were harvested on August 28. “To encourage organ donations and boost transplants, we have temporarily relaxed the criteria for in-house allocation,” said Dr Kishore Phadke, convener, Jeevasarthakathe.

“For the time being, we’ll follow the old rules. The donor hospital will get preference when it comes to organ allocation. If there are no suitable recipients at the donor hospital, then the organ will go to the general pool. As kidneys are shared organs, one of them will be given to the retrieval centre and other will go to the general pool,” said Dr Phadke.

More than 2,000 patients in the state are on the waiting list for kidneys alone and are surviving on dialysis. “Hospitals have to be transparent and ensure they do not take undue advantage of the situation during the pandemic. This was much needed to save lives of patients seeking organs. Non-Covid deaths must have gone up for want of organs, said a livertransplant surgeon from the city.

BENGALURU: A 31-year-old man from KR Puram, who was declared brain dead following an accidental fall at his workplace, breathed new life into three ailing people. The man’s heart, lungs, liver and corneas were harvested with the consent of his family members. This happens to be the first cadaver donation in Karnataka since March.

Narendra (name changed) worked as a plumber-cumelectrician. Around 5.30pm on August 19, Narendra, who was from Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, fell from the second floor of a building near Horamavu, where he was working. He was immediately rushed to a nearby private hospital, where he was on ventilator for six days, but showed no signs of improvement.

On August 26, Narendra was shifted to SSNMC hospital on the city’s outskirts. However, two days later he was declared brain dead and his family members were informed about the same, along with the possibility of organ donation if they agreed. Though they lost their only breadwinner, the grief-stricken family agreed to the idea. Narendra’s organs were retrieved the same day and allocated to needy recipients.

While his liver was given to a 40-year-old man at SSNMC hospital, the lungs went to to a 64-year old woman at Gleneagles Global Hospitals. Narendra’s heart went to a 29-yearold man at Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research. His corneas were also retrieved and donated to Narayana Nethralaya.

Narendra is survived by his wife and a two-year-old son. “We lost him because he sustained grievous injury. We can’t blame anyone. We were aware of organ donation and agreed when doctors informed us,” Narendra’s cousin told STOI.

BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted on Saturday night that floods have wreaked havoc in 394 villages in nine districts of Madhya Pradesh, and that 7,000 people have been rescued.

Narmada was flowing 9ft over the danger mark at 894ft in Nemawar area of Dewas, forcing evacuation of at least four villages. Narmada water began surging over Mortakka bridge in Khandwa, forcing police to stop traffic. Rivers feeding the Narmada, like Jamner, were also flooded, cutting off roads to several villages.

CM Chouhan said five people stranded in Chhindwara were rescued by helicopter. Villages in Hoshangabad, Sehore and Raisen have been hit hard by floods. “Two Air Force helicopters were sought to rescue people in Hoshangabad, Sehore and Raisen, but the choppers could not reach due to bad weather. We have asked for more helicopters from IAF. Rescue work will start from early Sunday morning,” the CM said.

CHIKKABALLAPUR: An agricultural labourer in Chikkaballapur district sold his 3-month-old daughter for Rs 1 lakh and bought a new motorbike and a mobile phone. The infant, sold to a childless couple from a neighbouring village, was rescued by officials of the women and child welfare department on Saturday.

While the girl’s mother was detained, the father is on the run. (The identities of the parents have been concealed.) The incident occurred at Tinakal village in Chintamani taluk, about 70km from Bengaluru. Acting on a tipoff, officials went to the village and questioned a few people, including the mother. According to sources, this was the man’s second marriage. He was known for his flamboyance and known to indulge in splurging.

When baby was born, the parents planned to sell her and were negotiating with some persons in Bengaluru. However, their plan was foiled as hospital authorities were vigilant. In the meantime, another person got wind of their intention and struck a deal with the man on behalf of a childless couple of Malamachanahalli in Siddlaghatta taluk. The latter, aged over 50 years, had paid Rs 1 lakh for the baby.

Subsequently, the man reportedly bought a motorbike for Rs 50,000 and a smartphone for Rs 15,000.

Mom appeals to authorities to give back her child

His spending spree aroused suspicions among neighbours who soon realised the baby had been missing. They alerted officials who visited the house. They’re yet to confirm when the baby was handed over to the couple. The mother maintained she agreed to sell the baby as her husband had threatened with dire consequences.

The baby was rescued and handed over to the adoption centre in Chikkaballapura, according to Lakshmidevi, Child Development Project Officer, Chikkaballapura.

Meanwhile, the mother appealed to authorities to give back her child. A decision about it will be taken at the sitting of the Child Welfare Committee on Tuesday, said Lakshmidevi. Police have launched a manhunt for the father.

While the film’s story was a memorable one, one of the most intriguing parts of Saaho was also the action sequences. “I was shocked with the way we shot action sequences for Saaho,” said Prabhas, adding, “One of the most difficult action scenes we shot was where heavy vehicles had to skid on the road. To stop it at that speed requires a lot of precision on part of the driver, I had never seen such a thing.”The star also stated that in the course of making this film, he had a chance to witness some thrilling scenes being canned first-hand. “I realised they take a lot of planning and technique. My friends and I had seen such scenes and behind-the-scenes footage for international films but it’s a whole different feeling to see it all live,” he added. But before Saaho, Prabhas was part of the magnum opus Baahubali , which is not devoid of action sequences. “Yes, I have done action scenes in the past and I know how to ride a horse, ride a bike and drive a car, but the real work is always put in by technicians,” he states.The action sequences of Saaho were designed by multiple stunt choreographers including Kenny Bates of Transformers and Die Hard fame and took over a year to master. “In some cases, the action masters reached the location days before us; the producers roped in the best technicians for the film from all around the world. The truck sliding scene is performed by a specialist who did it for the Transformer series. It’s not been created on graphics; it was shot for real,” he revealed.Prabhas has his kitty full with interesting films now. The actor was shooting for Radhe Shyam, previously titled Jaan, with Pooja Hegde in Georgia when the pandemic hit.

Along with it, 22 deaths were reported on Saturday, taking the toll to 1,345. Over 33% of MP’s toll has come in August, at an alarming rate of one every 90 minutes.

To add to the worry, all 52 districts of the state reported fresh cases on Saturday — for the first time this month — and 37 districts reported double-digit figures.

Indore, again, had the highest tally on Saturday at 226, followed Bhopal (175), Gwalior (168) and Jabalpur

(126), says the state health bulletin.

These four districts have been on top of the charts all month, accounting for over 53% of MP’s active-case count of 13,117.

A total of 250 volunteers from Mysuru and Bengaluru have signed up for the trials.

“On day 1, we administered the vaccine candidate to two volunteers. They are aged 30 and 40,” said Dr H Basavanagowdappa, principal of JSS Medical College . “The screening of other volunteers participating in these trials is under progress. Two scientists of ICMR are monitoring these trials.”

This is the second such trial being carried out in the state. The other vaccine in trial is the indigenous Covaxin, for which Bharat Biotech has partnered with Belagavi-based Jeevan Rekha Hospital.

JABALPUR: PDS ration stocked in warehouses in Madhya Pradesh ’s Balaghat and Mandla districts is “suitable only for goats and sheep”, the Centre has written to the state.

The ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution has asked the MP government to withhold further distribution of rice stocks across the state.

“They are unfit for human consumption,” says a report sent by the ministry to principal secretary, department of food and civil supplies, in MP.

A team led by a deputy commissioner had inspected depots of state agencies and fair-price shops in Balaghat and Mandla from July 30 to August 2 this year. It collected 32 samples —31 from depots and one from a ration shop — which were analysed in NABL-accredited Central Grain Analysis Laboratory (CGAL), Krishi Bhawan, New Delhi. It is the referral lab for SAARC countries as well, said officials.

“Analysis found that all 32 samples were not just beyond the rejection limit, as per the uniform specifications issued by the ministry, but also beyond PFA standards as per FSSAI,” reads the report, a copy of which is with TOI. “Stocks are found to be unfit for human consumption and in the category of ‘feed’ — suitable for livestock such as goat, horse, sheep and poultry,” the report adds.

According to the records of godowns, the stocks from where samples were drawn were procured in May-July 2020 while the condition of the stock represents a different picture altogether, says the report sent by ministry’s deputy commissioner Vishwajeet Haldar.

‘Stocks 100% recycled, grave lapses in quality of rice’

The stocks are 100% recycled old stocks and the gunny bags used for storage are also at least two to three years old,” he adds, pointing out that sample analysis clearly depicts “grave shortcomings in the quality of rice”.

“There have been grave lapses by district officers, officials and authorities in the entire channel from procurement to distribution. The personnel need to be identified and proceedings may be initiated against them under PFA/ FSSAI Act,” he said.

The ministry has asked the state government to blacklist the rice millers involved in delivery of such stocks with immediate effect. In this context, concern has arisen regarding the other stocks in Madhya Pradesh, said Haldar, adding: “It is requested to withhold rice stocks available in the depots till further investigation and re-categorization”.

The MP government has been asked to submit an action taken report at the earliest to the ministry.

484,['30/08/2020'],Chief secretary will probe scholarship scam: Punjab CM Amarinder Singh,"Punjab CM Amarinder Singh

CHANDIGARH: Insisting that nobody found guilty of complicity in the alleged scholarship scam would be spared, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday had asked the chief secretary to conduct a thorough probe into the case, which will be taken to its logical conclusion as per the law.

The chief secretary, Vini Mahajan will look into all aspects of the case, and anyone found involved, whatever his position within or outside the government, would be penalised and punished in accordance with the legal provisions, said Amarinder. Law will take its course, he asserted.

The chief minister said nobody could be put on the mat without a fair probe and proper inquiry, which cabinet minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot also deserved. “There is rule of law, which needs to be followed,” he said, adding that he would not succumb to the Opposition trial in the case.

‘AAP behaving like rogue party’

However, there was no question of protecting or shielding anyone, and action under the law would be taken if anyone was found guilty of any involvement in the case, he added.

The chief minister also lashed out at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for behaving like a rogue party by baying for Dharamsot’s blood without a proper inquiry.

“Are we living in a state of anarchy, with no rule of law,” Captain Amarinder asked, reacting strongly to the completely unwarranted and uncalled for demand of AAP and Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) MLAs, who had created a din in the Vidhan Sabha on Friday over the issue.

“Do you really expect me to take action without a proper inquiry against my own minister when I have not done so even against many Opposition leaders?” asked Amarinder, pointing out that Dharamsot has already said he is ready to face any inquiry in the matter. Unfortunately, allegations and counter-allegations had become a way of life in Indian politics, he added.

BHOPAL: An elephant was electrocuted in a freak accident in the core area of Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (BTR) in Madhya Pradesh’s Umaria district on Friday afternoon.

The female was moving with a herd of 15-20 when it raised its trunk and touched a live high-tension wire.

There had been several instances of tigers, deer and wild boars getting electrocuted by transmission lines passing through forest areas in the state, but this is the first time in over 50 years that a wild elephant became the victim.

“I can’t recall the death of any wild elephant in many years. We will survey transmission lines passing through forest corridors and mitigate the problem with the help of electricity department,” says Alok Kumar, chief wildlife warden of the state.

BTR officials said the herd was heading for Gangital village in the afternoon, and a forest team was on its trail.

Jumbo was gasping; died before med help could reach

While crossing a pond in Gangital Beat of Panapatha Range around 1-1.30pm, the female elephant tried to climb a ridge and accidently touched the live wire with its trunk. When the elephant monitoring team arrived, it was gasping and died before medical help could reach,” said a release. On Saturday, BTR field director Vincent Rahim and veterinarian Nitin Gupta went to the spot for the post-mortem. Samples were preserved for further investigation. After autopsy, the carcass was buried as per SOP, said officials.

CHANDIGARH: Against the backdrop of a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases and many deaths, Punjab government has claimed to have screened over 42% of the state's population through a house-to-house survey to identify suspected patients and to conduct prompt testing for containing spread of the infection.

In the first phase of the survey, which concluded on August 10, the teams of the state health department examined 11,677,651 individuals across the state, out of total population 27,704,236 as per the 2011 Census. The exercise proved beneficial for the health authorities for early detection of symptomatic and persons with co-morbidities. The remaining population will be covered under the second phase.

Under the survey, the population above 30 years was surveyed to identify infected people in the community while people below 30 years having co-morbidity, influenza like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) were also examined.

In Punjab, more than 4 lakh had hypertension, 2.26 lakh diabetes

Special emphasis was given to high priority zones — clusters, micro-containment zones and large outbreak zones — identified in the worst-hit areas of the state. Majority of the high priority areas are in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Patiala and Mohali.

Sharing the details, Punjab health department spokesperson for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said during the survey, 4,11,000 people were found to be suffering from hypertension, 2,26,000 with diabetes and 6,823 chronic kidney disease.

A total of 11,677 people were found to be symptomatic, 2,432 had fever, 1,050 sore throat, 5,017 cough, 937 diarrhoea and 613 coughing up blood. A total of 932 people had ILIs and 225 SARI. Early detection of such people is of significance as they carry a heavy virus load and transmit the virus further at a higher rate than asymptomatic people. As many as 8,011 people with ILI or SARI have tested positive for the virus till date in Punjab.

A total of 14,86,996 people, highest in the state, were examined in Ludhiana, the most densely-populated district and worst hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. In Amritsar, 10,41,411 individuals were screened and 835,147 and 824,872 in Jalandhar and Patiala, respectively. Strong 26,522 workforce, comprising ASHA, Anganwadi workers and volunteers equipped with smartphones, was pressed into service with a questionnaire to gather information.

Dr Bhaskar said the exercise proved beneficial as it helped in timely detection of infected people. “Door to door survey is one of the key components of our containment strategy. The second phase of the exercise has been planned and will be initiated shortly,” he said.

489,['30/08/2020'],Madhya Pradesh: Widening 18km highway could save thousands of trees in Choral jungle,"Land has been earmarked in Choral jungle to build a stretch of the highway

INDORE: A realignment of 18km of the proposed Indore-Icchapur highway would save 170 acres of forest land in Choral Range.

If National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) considers widening the existing Indore-Khandwa road to six lanes, Indore wouldn’t be shorn of its precious green cover.

On the blueprint, 18km of the 201km-long highway passes through Choral jungle in Indore district as the officials claimed that widening the existing Indore-Khandwa Road will lead to the demolition of several houses and other structures in Bigram, Simrol and Choral.

By moving the road through Choral jungle, the officials have avoided paying hefty compensation to house owners and potential litigation, which would have delayed the project.

Besides, NHAI wants to maintain a speed of 100kmph on the Indore-Icchapur highway. If the widened highway passes through Bigram, Simrol and Choral, local traffic will crisscross it and the risk of accidents will shoot up, said an official.

NHAI officials thus realigned the 18km stretch through the jungle, bypassing residential areas but putting thousands of trees on the chopping block. The authorities have said they will plant twice as many trees to ‘compensate’. However, since it is unlikely that so much vacant land will be found in Indore, the compensatory plantation will probably happen in another district and Indore’s loss will be permanent.

Counting of trees to be felled is well under way. Already facing a loss of around 70 acres of forest land, provided to MP Metro Rail Corporation for developing a depot at Super Corridor in Indore, forest officials are clueless how they will compensate the loss in Choral.

The film hit screens not just in Telugu, but also Tamil and Hindi too. Apart from the lead pair, Saaho starred Jackie Shroff, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Evelyn Sharma, Chunky Pandey, Mahesh Manjrekar, Mandira Bedi, Vennela Kishore, Murli Sharma and more in key roles. Seeing as how the film hit screens two years after Baahubali 2, expectations were high and despite the negative reviews on the film’s opening day, it went on to do good business at the box office. Take a look at five interesting facts about the film:Before the film’s release, there were numerous rumours that Prabhas had hiked up his budget for the film, due to Baahubali. However, the star clarified, “Baahubali set the bar high, but Saaho was mounted on a massive scale, so I knew I couldn’t charge my usual remuneration. I started out with a twenty percent cut. Then the film’s budget went slightly over and while the producers were ready to pay up, I couldn’t take the money because of how much they had put into the film.”Saaho has been mounted on a humongous budget of Rs 350 Cr as nothing was compromised on for the film. The film was also shot on the most advanced cameras of recent times, one which provide high-quality output that would look good on big screens. The picture resolution of said camera is also high as compared to normal movie cameras.An estimated number of one lakh fans turned up for the Saaho pre-release event in Hyderabad at Ramoji Film City. The evening with a glitzy one, with Rs 2 Cr spent on stage design and other arrangements, state reports. The cast and crew were in attendance and some props used in the film were also on display.Saaho had multiple action sequences, so multiple action directors were roped on-board to ensure there was no repetition. Well-known international stunt man Kenny Bates was one among them, known for his work in Die Hard and Transformers. Apart from him, reports state that Peng Zhang, Dhilip Shubbarayan, Stunt Silva, Stefan Richter, Bob Brown and Ram – Lakshman were also brought on-board.Sujeeth made his debut with the small budget film Run Raja Run. Prabhas had promised he would work with him, so the director waited two long years after his debut for Prabhas to wrap up Baahubali 2. Initially, Saaho was not mounted on such a large scale.

HISAR: Police plan to go for a DNA analysis to ascertain the paternity of a 15-year-old girl’s baby, after the eightmonth pregnant teenager’s family alleged that she was raped several times over the past year by a 13-year-old boy.

In-charge of women police station said the boy’s sample had been collected at a civil hospital on Saturday and that of the baby would be collected after its birth. On a complaint by the girl’s mother, police have registered a case against the 13-year-old boy, his father, sister, and a cousin. Police have not made any arrests, said the cop, adding that further action would be taken only after the DNA report.

The FIR has been registered under sections 363 (kidnapping), 366-A (procuration of minor girl), 376 (3) (rape on a woman under sixteen years of age), 376 (2)(n)( rape repeatedly on the same woman), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc., with intent to commit an offence), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

While the accusations against his family are not clear, the boy has been accused of raping the girl last year and then threatening to defame her to coerce her into having an physical relationship with him. The DNA test would be conducted at Haryana Forensic Science Laboratory in Madhuban, Hisar , said the inspector.

In the police complaint, the girl’s mother said her husband passed away some years ago, after which the boy’s father, a distant relative, started coming to her house. Both her daughter and his daughter were friends since childhood, due to which her daughter used to go to his house, she said.

“Last year, my daughter went to their home to meet his daughter, but his son was alone there. The minor drugged her, after which she fell unconscious and he raped her. He threatened to defame her and threatened to kill her in case she complained to anyone and after this he raped her continuously,” she alleged.

The cop said the woman alleged that her daughter complained of a stomach ache some days ago and she took her to a doctor, only to find out that the teenager was eight months pregnant. “In a panchayat meeting called to resolve the issue, the woman refused to marry the girl to the accused and decided to approach the police,” said the cop.

Using the crisis as an opportunity to connect with the masses, the party has decided to open 14,000 oximeter centres across the state.

The process of setting up the centres began last week itself, but officially, it was started from Panchkula on Friday, with Rajya Sabha member and party’s Haryana in-charge Sushil Gupta formally launching the initiative. He was accompanied by Surendra Rathee, president of the Panchkula district unit of AAP.

“Haryana has left the Covid-infected persons at the mercy of god. Had the system been powerful or infrastructure was in hospitals, CM Khattar and his MLAs would not have rushed to private hospitals. Hence, we decided to help the people,’’ said Gupta.
