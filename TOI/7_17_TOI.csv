0,['17/07/2020'],Diamond: The most meaningful gift,"For billions of years, natural diamonds have stood the test of time and endurance and have come to represent character, rarity and the commitment of a lifetime. Through their journey on earth, these diamonds have stood strong during natural disasters, extreme heat in the Earth’s mantle where they’re formed, and a myriad of other stringent processes and checks before they’re ready to be held in the hands and hearts of a customer.The value of natural diamonds has risen with time and the promises they hold only deepened. As the world collectively grapples with the ongoing pandemic, the De Beers Group has been working actively to understand the consumers’ attitude and perspective towards buying diamonds and monitoring how these evolve through different stages of the pandemic.Here are few top trends that have emerged from the latest Diamond Insight Flash Report by De Beers:- Around 45% of those surveyed said they are more likely to buy fewer, better things, and invest more in those items that they buy. Two-thirds of consumers polled indicated that their personal finances have not been affected due to the current situation and are optimistic about their financial situation for the next three years.- Consumers have said that the quarantine period has had many positive effects on their lives as they are able to focus on more time with family, less time commuting and feeling grateful for things they took for granted. For those who own diamond jewellery, these little joys have led them to attach a deep sentimental connect to pieces of diamond jewellery they continue wearing while sheltering in place, primarily because — “I never take it off” and “it makes me feel connected to someone.”- As people look forward to the holiday season after long lockdowns, 56% of those surveyed believe gifts should be meaningful, more than “practical’’, “functional” or “fun.” Diamonds top the gift list as they symbolize intimacy, connectedness, and love amongst both men and women. Diamonds are the top gifting choice surpassing gold or platinum jewelry, designer clothing or accessories, electronics, furniture or watches, because they reflect a sense of gratitude and acknowledgement for partners and mothers during the recent crisis.- In 2020, 80% of US women agree that diamonds are a valuable asset to own and 78% believe they will always retain their value. We wanted to know more about the kinds of gifts people want to give for the holidays and found that 90% of consumers feel it is important to give a gift to a loved one that holds its value over time making it an ultimate symbol of love, commitment, achievement and self-expression — all of which natural diamonds promise.Natural diamonds are tiny time capsules that formed up to 3.5 billion years ago. Most of the diamonds recovered today come from only 15% of kimberlite deposits discovered decades ago, of which only 1% are suitable for diamond recovery. Diamond supply is finite, and the finest natural diamonds will become increasingly rare as we go forward. To own a rare and precious natural diamond is to have your own little piece of history that's forever captured the irreplaceable emotion or priceless memory for each buyer.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77000778,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-280498/77000778.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/luxury/fashion/diamond-the-most-meaningful-gift/articleshow/77000667.cms

The film, which has Ragini Prajwal making her debut and headlining an ensemble cast, has drawn a lot of curiosity after the trailer release. Talking about her role and the reasons one should watch the film, she says, ""I play Nandini and the entire film revolves around her. She is someone who stands up for herself and for what is right, be it for other women or any situation. In current times, many of us hesitate to do just that. This is something all women should watch. I hope they do."" While taking to acting, Ragini was sure that singing and dancing around trees was not the agenda and that’s why a script like that of Law intrigued her. And her family, she says, has been quite supportive of her new career path. ""How many women begin their acting career after marriage? Prajwal used to come on set and help me with the dialogue delivery. Being a classical dancer, it is easy to over-emote. He taught me subtleties,"" she says.As for the film’s online release, she says, ""When it comes to a crime thriller with a strong woman protagonist, an OTT release is the best.

Adapting to the new normal

A time to experiment and introduce new products

If you thought that the lockdown was only bad news for business, think again. Though many establishments shut shop or suspended operations during the previous lockdown, Bengaluru's small businesses and home entrepreneurs made the most of the down time and are looking forward to more this time around.Take for instance home baker Zahan Gafoor . The youngster has been selling brownies for over two years now through social media. And the lockdown, he says, kept him busy like never before. ""It gave me more time to bake and post pictures. Then people started ordering,"" he shares, adding that he received so many orders, that there was a two-day wait for his customers.Similarly, the demand for telecom professional Maitrayee Roy's cross stitch products, too, rose during the lockdown. ""I used to make decorative pieces and home decor products earlier. But during the first lockdown, I made masks for my son and myself and shared the images on social media. Then the number of orders kept rising. Now, I get at least four to five orders on a daily basis, and most of them are for masks,"" says Maitrayee, whose masks are washable and reusable.Given the current scenario, these entrepreneurs had to ensure a few changes in the way they function. ""We began taking extra precautions even though none of us stepped out during the lockdown. I began wearing gloves while baking. Earlier, the delivery person would pick the order from my doorstep. But now I leave the package on a table outside the house and the delivery person picks it from there,"" says Zahan.Despite the price of meat going up during the lockdown, Radhica Muthappa , who along with her husband, Uttam, prepares and sells traditional pork dishes from home, managed to give her customers a discount. ""If there were multiple deliveries from the same area, we would club them and contact and coordinate with other delivery boys in such a way that the delivery charges were less for the customers,"" she shares.Besides giving home entrepreneurs more time to invest, the lockdown also gave them room to experiment. Roopa Vasanth was able to experiment with different swirl techniques for her artisan handmade soaps. ""The soaps we make are all handmade. Apart from the ingredients, we give a lot of importance to how they look as well. Hence, I experimented with different techniques like the drop swirl, hanger swirl and layered techniques. These techniques give the soaps a different look. For example, if I want my soaps looking like beach waves, I use the in-the-pot swirl technique,"" she says, adding, ""Initially, lockdown did slow the business a bit, but orders slowly started pouring in and now I take pre-orders and have them ready to be shipped.""Zahan too experimented with recipes and introduced ‘Nutella Brookies’ - a mix of cookies and brownies - which he says are a hit. ""I tried these brookies during the lockdown and now they are the most popular item,"" he says. Similarly, Radhica and Uttam too introduced new items on their menu like the Calcutta Entally and the Northern Thai Sai Oua sausages among other items, which were a huge hit among their customers. ""We tried out different recipes during the lockdown and these dishes are a part of the menu now. We keep rotating our dishes from time to time,"" she says.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77004869,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-165980,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-lockdown-blues-say-bengalurus-home-entrepreneurs-as-orders-pour-in/articleshow/77004894.cms

5,['17/07/2020'],#DistanceSelling: Sari shopping now gets a virtual fix,"With her D-Day fast approaching, bride-to-be Mythreyee realised that most entries in her wedding check list remained unchecked, with the biggest one being her saris. With the threat of the pandemic in full swing, stepping out to stores was not an option. This is when she discovered the world of distance selling.In keeping with the new norms, retailers in the city are gearing up with customised services including real-time video calls and at-house visitations as part of their offerings. “Sari shopping is not something that can be done alone. You need to go as a group to pick the right ones. Even, say a couple of months down the lane, you cannot be 100 per cent sure about one’s safety outdoors. Virtual shopping seems like the most sensible option at a time like this,” says Mythreyee, whose family has already begun sifting through choices online.Palam Silks, which has been providing the video calling experience ever since May, looks at the distance selling model as an interesting avenue. “The safety of customers is our number one priority. So, even if our stores are open, a few prefer to video chat with us to get an idea of our collection,” says Vineeta from the online operations at Palam Silks. The virtual experience also gives customers a chance to look at a range of collections from different branches, she adds.“We also have a trained team in place to take care of our virtual customers. Most of them still feel as if they came to the store and bought the sari,” she says, adding that the model has found many takers among brides in particular. Pothys, which recently rolled out their virtual aadi sale experience, looks at the avenue as a mood-lifter for people who find joy in retail therapy.“For the past few months, we have all been under a great deal of stress with things coming to a halt. We slowly came to realise that this was becoming a way of life. So, more than a business opportunity, we look at this as a way to keep customers happy at their homes,” says Ramesh Pothy, the managing director of the chain.The real time video option is aimed at people who are reluctant to step out to the stores, he adds. The virtual experience, however, is no replacement to its physical counterpart, he observes. “That said, there is nothing like coming to the shop and feeling the threads of the sari on your hands before buying. This is for the time being,” he notes.It is still too new and raw to gauge the model’s feasibility, says Niranth Nalli of Nalli Silks, which has been continuing its tradition of providing video call services to regulars, well through the pandemic as well. “We have been providing video conferencing services for limited customers, after which we send over a few saris for them to select from. The only problem with video calls is that the phone enhances the image. The true colour of a sari might not be reflected on a phone screen,” says Niranth, the vice-chairperson of the emporium, adding that the model still needs to be explored.Apart from video call shopping, retailers also offer home visitations. “We set up contactless at-home visitation services for those who want to pick saris from a range of collections. The virtual formal also calls for a lot of rethinking. We are currently in the middle of formulating an aadi sale in the virtual video format in the interest of the customer’s safety,” says Jairam, managing director of Rasi Silks, adding that the video call format is now taking precedence during the pandemic.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77005092,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-464650/77005092.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/distanceselling-sari-shopping-now-gets-a-virtual-fix/articleshow/77005092.cms

A Punjabi TV show that resumed shooting in Mohali near Chandigarh, had to replace its child actor who was actually seven years old and another lady who is over 65. Speaking to us, the director of the show ' Khasma Nu Khani 'Rajeev Sham Laal Soni said, ""Our child actor was younger than 10, so we had to replace him with another kid who is 11.

She says, ""Given how the Covid has panned out in Mumbai I am nearly glad I am not there right now and got this show at an opportune time.""Sukhpreet, on the other hand, has been living in Punjab.Resuming shooting, the actors are taking all precautions possible on sets. While the production house has ensured the follow govt SOPs , on their part the actors are going the extra mile to stay as safe as possible. Says Sukhpreet, ""I live with my family in Mohali so I have to be careful of not transmitting the virus to them. The first thing I do when I get home is take a shower and change all clothes and sanitise all accessories I was carrying, even if it was a small purse. I scrub off all possible makeup too for fear of it carrying any infection.""Navdeesh doesn't live with his family in Mohali, hence doesn't have to undergo the sanitising protocol for others, albeit he does it for himself. ""Everyone does fear for their own life too. Hence, we all take precautions. Before starting the shoot, everyone, including the laborers working on sets, were made to undergo medical check-up and everyone was found to be healthy,"" he says, adding, Before starting the shoot the biggest worry for every actor was doing the scenes that involve coming close to others or doing intimate scenes.

BUDAPEST: Ferrari drivers Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc put their Styrian Grand Prix collision behind them on Thursday, but without much optimism for the immediate future.

Ferrari, last year's Formula One runners-up, are fifth overall after two races in which they rode their luck and then lost it.

Leclerc was a fortunate second in the Austrian opener, despite the car lacking straight-line speed, but the pair's first-lap collision in the second race ended their involvement after about 20 seconds.

Leclerc immediately accepted it had been his fault.

""I think we've put it behind us,"" Leclerc told a video news conference ahead of Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix. ""I directly went to talk to Seb after the race to excuse myself. I think he accepted that.

""On my side, I will focus on this weekend and trying to achieve the best result possible.""

Vettel, sitting at a safely spaced distance with both wearing face masks as part of measures against COVID-19, said there was not much to add.

""These things are the worst that can happen, obviously if two cars of the same colour come together it's something we always try to avoid.

""But you are racing and this stuff unfortunately was part of it. We spoke about it, it's behind us and a couple of days later we have a chance to do better here in Hungary.""

Ferrari have upgrades for the race on both cars but Leclerc said there was still a lot to do.

Asked whether Ferrari had slipped out of the lead pack and into the midfield, the Monegasque accepted the sport's oldest and most successful team were not likely to win anything just yet.

""I think realistically we are struggling with the performance at the moment so I don't think we can consider us as fighting for podiums at the moment,"" he said. ""But we will try to change that.""

""It is expected that to provide safe healthcare services, all government hospitals/labs as well as all private NABH/NABL hospitals/labs may initiate antigen testing and also apply for obtainlng login credentials for data entry into the ICMR portal.""

In an effort to facilitate and further liberalize testing,lCMR has generated five common login credentials for each district of each State/ UT, which may be shared with all Government and private facilities selected for antigen testing.

ICMR DG goes on to say that in this Covid-19 pandemic , to ensure that testing is further enhanced and reporting of the same is done seamlessly states should identify all government and private facilities who would be providing COVID-19 diagnosis through antigen-based assays.

""The common login credentials should be shared with all government and private facilities approved by the state. lndividual organizations should not separately approach ICMR now for obtaining logins for antigen testing. However, ICMR / Mentor lnstitutes will continue to review and approve all applications for RT-PCR based testing,"" the ICMR DG states.

11,['17/07/2020'],Racism: Maybe some in the cosmetic industry are realising that fairness creams feed racist and colourist stereotypes: Nandita Das,"In a culture where beauty is primarily defined by the colour of one’s skin, it’s quite lovely that suddenly the billion-dollar ‘whitening’ industry wants to be fair! I don’t think anyone saw this coming,” says Nandita Das , who launched the Dark Is Beautiful campaign in 2009, in response to the recent move by several companies – like Fair & Lovely, Neutrogena, Loreal, Clean & Clear, Nivea etc to drop the word ‘fair’, ‘white’ and ‘light’ from their advertising, packaging and promotional vocabulary. We caught up with the actor on the subject. Excerpts: Even though it is more symbolic (after all they have not discontinued the product, just changed the messaging), it is still a big step forward. Changing the name alone will not change anything, but words do matter.Time will tell if it is going to stop at this or the larger messaging and the product are actually going to change. We were introduced to the these prejudices at a very young age and slowly children begin to understand the politics of colour.I was told by a friend from Chennai that in the South if you are dark you learn singing, and if you are fair, you learn dance because you have to perform on stage and 'look good'. In subtle and blatant ways, kids hear it too – things like, ‘uska rang saaf hai’ to describe a fair-skinned person as if dark skin is dirty. Given that we’re exposed to these biases very early in our lives, it also needs to be addressed right from our childhood. Or else it can rob children of their confidence and sense of self, and scar them more than we can imagine.Johnson & Johnson also announced that it would stop its line of skin whitening products. Also, that they would add more shades to their Band-Aids outside of the current ‘skin colour’. Whose skin are we talking about anyway! I thought to myself, ‘well, better late than never’. Maybe some in the cosmetic industry are realising that such products and imageries feed racist and colourist stereotypes.We need to solve the problem of fairness obsession we all carry. They are only using the age-old prejudice to sell more creams and fancy dreams to entice more customers. Probably because most actors were becoming lighter with every film.

12,['17/07/2020'],Patna: DRI seizes gold biscuits worth Rs 1.96 crore smuggled from Myanmar,"A DRI personnel shows gold biscuits seized from the accused duo

PATNA: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) along with help of customs sleuths arrested two smugglers and recovered 3.98kg of gold biscuits worth Rs 1.96 crore hidden inside their undergarments and luggage from Mithapur bus stand under the Jakkanpur police station area in Patna on Wednesday.

The arrested duo were produced before a court in Muzaffarpur on Thursday which sent them to judical custody.

Sources said that the operation was simultaneously carried out at Silliguri in West Bengal and in national capital too from where altogether 8kg smuggled gold was seized.

The arrested accused in Patna, Silliguri and New Delhi were of the same gang and had smuggled approximately 12kg of gold from Myanmar via More in Manipur which is located on the Indo-Myanmar international border.

“The gang members got separated and were following different routes to reach New Delhi for delivering the consignment,” a source said.

They said that the duo arrested in Patna had already boarded a private bus bearing registration number of Uttar Pradesh which was scheduled to leave for Delhi.

“Just before 5-10 minutes of departure, teams of DRI and customs entered the bus at Mithapur and arrested the duo. We suspect that name and address told by both the arrested men were not original,” sources said adding they had started from Guwahati in Assam and had stayed at hotel after reaching Patna by road.

They said that altogether 24 biscuits of gold weighing 3982.49 gram were seized of which some were kept hidden inside undergarments of one of the smugglers while rest were concealed inside a suitcase which the two smugglers were carrying.

“We suspect that the gold biscuits were actually manufactured in some European country from where they were first smuggled to Myanmar and then further into India,” a source said adding further investigation were going on in connection with the smuggling case.

Excerpts from a conversation:For me, Chandigarh is home. The city, its people and the food fill me with so much happiness that it gets hard to return to Mumbai. When the lockdown was lifted, we packed and came here. I’m glad Apar (actor-brother Aparshakti Khurana ), too, made the same decision. This city helps me unwind and find child-like joys. I’m reliving some of my best moments.Yes. We’d been looking for a bigger house for a while, and what better time to nest together than now! It was a collective decision. We are a big family, with Apar being married and Tahira and I having two kids. Space is essential, and we wanted the family to stay together. There’s magic in the whole family living together, and we want our kids to experience that.Actually, spending time with family has been surreal! We get together to play board games or for musical evenings. Almost sabhi gaate hain hamare ghar mein . Tahira and I go cycling in the bylanes, remembering our growing up years (the couple met at school in the city). The family bonds together, which is precious, because I haven’t had that for years. Throughout the lockdown, I was busy with narrations and was looking for good scripts. I’ve found some gems and have been jamming with my directors on the same. I’ve been writing a lot, too.I hope it gave others courage to resume work. I want to see Bollywood restart with all safety measures, because our industry supports a lot of people. It’s heartbreaking to see them out of work for so long. This was primarily the reason I decided to shoot. I was ecstatic about going back on the set, too. I feel humans adapt and evolve, and if this is the new normal, let’s find a way around this.The pandemic has given us a chance to slow down and absorb what’s happening around us. It has made us aware we are united as humans and things like this impact the world. I hope it will make us think responsibly towards nature, community and our country. It is compelling us to rethink and re-evaluate our beliefs and nudge us to think about sustainability.

MANCHESTER: Dom Sibley and Ben Stokes ground out patient half-centuries as England battled to 207 for three at the close on day one of the second Test against the West Indies at Old Trafford on Thursday.England were wobbling on 81 for three before Sibley and Stokes shared an unbeaten 126-run stand to give the hosts the upper hand on a day when only 82 overs were bowled after rain delayed the start.Opener Sibley remained unbeaten on 86 while Stokes also took his time to get settled on a damp pitch before reaching 59 not out at stumps.""Dom concentrates very well. He's willing to bat for long periods of time and that's what we needed at the top,"" England coach Chris Silverwood told Sky Sports.""Those partnerships have put us in a great position. We've got to back it up tomorrow.""West Indies had won the toss and chosen to bowl to take advantage of seam-friendly conditions but it was off-spinner Roston Chase who dismissed opener Rory Burns and Zak Crawley.Chase trapped Burns lbw for 15 at the stroke of lunch before Crawley flicked the first ball of the second session straight to Windies captain Jason Holder at leg-slip.England skipper Joe Root , who missed the first Test to attend the birth of his child, stitched together a 52-run partnership with Sibley to stabilise the innings before edging an Alzarri Joseph outswinger to Holder at slip to depart for 23.Sibley was handed two lifelines, dropped at short-leg to deny Chase a third wicket and again on 68 when a thick outside edge off Shannon Gabriel flew to second slip where Holder dropped the catch.England are without Jofra Archer after the fast bowler breached the team's bio-secure protocols while Mark Wood and James Anderson were rested.

Ever since the ISC results were announced, Archishman Ghosh’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing. Congratulatory messages have been pouring in not just from his friends and relatives, but his teachers from MP Birla Foundation as well. After all, securing 99.25% marks in the board exams is no mean feat. But unlike previous years, the toppers from Bengal did not get an opportunity to welcome any visitors at home so far. “I guess, we have to understand the given situation and accept this as the new normal ,” said Archishman.

Celebrations on with chocolates and homemade food

Sharing a similar experience, Bipraditya Mukherjee, who got 96.5% in ISC from MP Birla Foundation, said, “This year, my friends and family are sending over chocolates instead of my favourite mishti. My relatives are sceptical about sending sweets because no one is sure about the hygiene standards maintained by the sweet shops. As chocolates are packaged days before they are sold, the risk factor is less.”

It has been the same for Archishman as well. Soma Ghosh, Archishman's mother prepared luchi and basanti pulao as part of the celebrations. “If the situation was normal, my parents would have taken me to a nice restaurant. But given the present scenario, they decided against it. I enjoyed what my mother cooked,” said Archishman.

Even Kaji Samim Ahsan, who secured 95.4% in Madhyamik from Ballygunge Government High School , received a homemade biryani treat from his mother.

Gifts delivered via courier

Most of these students are overwhelmed by the gifts they are receiving as a token of their achievements, but are equally upset that they can’t meet their uncles and aunts in person to share their happiness. Kaji rued, “I love videogames and I hope my uncle sends me one as promised. But the worst part is that he won’t be able to come to our place. He will send me the gift via post instead.”

Travel plans reserved for next year

A number of families who couldn’t plan a vacation in the past two years are disappointed. ""We had plans to go to some hill station after Archishman's boards, but that is impossible at the moment. So, we are planning to go to Durgapur, my maternal place for a few weeks. We can plan a vacation next year if the situation is better,” said Soma.

Susim Mukul Roy, who secured 96.75% marks in ISC from Garden High School , wanted to visit a beach destination after his exams, but that seems a distant dream as of now. “After almost three years of hard work, we wanted to celebrate Susim’s achievements by planning a vacation.

Another daily record was broken with 4,169 cases on Thursday, taking the total number to 51,422. Of these, 36,180 were reported in July at a rate of 2,261 cases a day.The number of cases in Bengaluru stood at 25,288, of which 20,733 were added in July, including 2,344 on Thursday. Comparatively, Chennai reported 1,157 cases and 23 deaths; Mumbai 1,476 and 56 and Delhi reported 1,652 and 58.The number of active cases in Karnataka and Bengaluru stood at 30,655 and 18,828, while the total number of recoveries were 19,729 and 5,952 respectively. Karnataka, experts say, must shift its focus on preventing deaths if it wants to emerge from the pandemic with a high recovery rate given that the number of cases could rise.Dr CN Manjunath, member, Karnataka Covid-19 taskforce, said: “The number of cases is bound to increase for two reasons: the anticipated peak and number of tests has increased. We’re now focussed on reducing deaths.”From testing about 10,900 samples a day on an average in June, the state has been testing more than 17,000 a day in July on an average. On Thursday, the state tested 23,451 samples, 19,347 of which returned negative.Most deaths in the state are still because of comorbidities like SARI and ILI, while clinical experts point to other effects of the virus that are affecting people’s hearts and lungs. As on Thursday, 539 patients, including 317 in Bengaluru were in the ICU.Manjunath said: “It is important we coordinate and ensure that critical and sick people get hospital beds . Our treatment strategy will also change as we learn new things about the virus. People whose health is not critical occupying beds is hurting patients who really need them”.Dr C Nagaraj, director, RGCID, and member, state Covid-19 death audit committee, said: “There's a need for more testing and the focus must also be on reducing the time taken to give the results. Besides, in 50% of the deaths audited by us and treated at our hospital, we've found that the patient spent only about a day or less than 24 hours at a hospital, leaving doctors with very little time to save them. And most deaths are severe SARI cases.”Among the 10,00,202 cases reported nationally, 6.3 lakh patients have been treated.

Their crushing loss in the finals has left the team with a lot to analyse. In conversation with Bombay Times, skipper Harmanpreet Kaur talks about the World Cup defeat, how the sport is taking a massive hit due to COVID-19, and women’s cricket is seeing a decent growth in the country’s sports scenario. Excerpts...While in Australia, we were aware that the virus was spreading, and we tried to stay safe. The crisis has affected everyone, but I feel that it’s important to be positive. Even as the restrictions ease, the fight needs to continue till the pandemic is eradicated from our planet. Sports are important for our well-being and it’s good to see that cricket has resumed. Players want to get back on field as well. However, work, sports... everything can be put on hold in order to save what’s most precious — our lives.It was the first time that our women’s cricket team made it to the T20 World Cup finals. We were a young team, which I am very proud of. It was unfortunate that we could not bring the World Cup home. We played good cricket and remained undefeated throughout the tournament. But, it was just not the right kind of presentation of our game on that particular day. We will carry this heartbreak forever, but each one of us has learnt a lot from it.My dad never differentiated between a boy and a girl. He motivated me to pursue cricket as a career, even when he was questioned by others about it. Money was never a driving force for me, playing for my country was. With time, I have seen growth in women’s cricket and a lot of involvement from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), spectators, fans and media. Today, it’s not very difficult for women to take up cricket professionally. If you are passionate about the sport and work sincerely, you will be recognised. Talking about my journey, it wasn’t easy. My training was at a school, which was 25 kms away from my house (in Moga, Punjab). If I missed the last bus back home at 6pm, it was a struggle to find an alternative transport. Later, I moved to Jalandhar for advanced training and that was the first time I stayed away from my parents. I got homesick in the beginning, but following a routine helped.I was introduced to professional cricket only when I was in class XI. It caught my interest because of its popularity. Having said that, I had never seen women’s cricket on TV and never imagined that I could play for my country one day.I look up to Virender Sehwag, and I also like the way Virat Kohli conducts himself on the field. He is consistent with his performance and that’s the biggest challenge for a sportsman.(Laughs!) I haven’t thought about it, but I would like to watch someone else play my character, rather than me playing myself in a film.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77008736,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-124603/77008736.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/today-its-not-very-difficult-for-women-to-take-up-cricket-professionally-harmanpreet-kaur/articleshow/77008736.cms

His house is a personification of his grand stature and aura along with a subtle taste for everything art and luxury. His abode is a gorgeous den we can completely imagine him longing to go back to after hectic days of shooting also because the house has a respectable place for the memories of the parents and their blessings.One of the most notable things in the Dutt house are the large paintings and portraits. Every wall is adorned with gorgeous paintings adding to the wow factor of the house. The living room also has huge portraits of parents Nargis and Sunil dutt which bring a lot of life to the room.Maanyata and Sanjay prefer wide and open spaces and hence even their kitchen is lavishly spread over a huge spacious area. The pristine white modular kitchen are highlighted with cylinder light lamps hanging from the roof making everything look voguish.If a house has too much breathing space, it automatically looks luxurious and if you adorn it with exquisite lamps and lights, it becomes exotic.

But since the bling is used in the right way and for the right things, it looks stylish, voguish and chic.We are guessing that the couple is completely in love with white since most of the areas in the house are kept white, including the bathroom.

The PIL is likely to come up for hearing next week.The petition has been filed by Neel Lakhani, a practising HC advocate who claims that victims are liable to get compensation under, and that funds received by government from various donors should be utilised to give compensation.The petition seeks the appointment of an ombudsman to identify victims and those affected by the coronavirus outbreak, so that they can receive compensation.A large number of persons have been affected by the pandemic, the plea stated, adding, “Several families lost their sole breadwinner. Many people have lost their jobs and poor people are unable to earn a livelihood. Therefore it is the duty of the State to provide compensation.”The plea added, “No doubt the Union Government and Gujarat government have announced many relief packages, but, as per petitioner’s information, none of the packages provide compensation to any person affected by the disaster, or to the family members of people who lost their lives due to the pandemic. Moreover, the packages can never be equated with the mandatory provisions regarding compensation under the Disaster Management Act.”The plea also sought funds received by Union and state governments be used for welfare of affected persons. “People who madeto the cause are in the dark regarding whether government packages equal the funds received through donations as well as financial aid given by organisations like WHO, USAID, IMF etc,” it stated.“The contributions, donations, as well as financial aid received by government in cash and kind are for the use of victims of Covid-19 pandemic. The donors, contributors, as well as victims have enforceable right to seek that the government be directed to ensure proper utilisation of the funds for relief and rehabilitation.

Even as Covid-19 increases spending, note from its finance dept says civic body must ‘reconsider all ongoing and forthcoming projects’ in view of falling revenue.With the economy grinding to a halt because of Covid-19, the BMC’s revenues fell by more than 80 per cent in the first quarter of the financial year (April 1 to June 30) from the same period last year. Data from the BMC’s finance department shows the civic body collected Rs 4,949.55 crore between April 1 and June 30 last year but just 19.5 per cent of that -or Rs 966.30 crore - over the same period this year.This, coupled with the civic body’s increased spending to tackle the pandemic, is nudging India’s richest municipal corporation into the red. The BMC’s finance department has warned in a note that the civic body must “reconsider all ongoing and forthcoming projects” given the massive drop in revenues expected this year. Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Chahal is now set to review the BMC’s spending on various projects. “We will be revising our expenditure due to revenue deficit on account of Covid-19,” Chahal said.According to the BMC’s budget estimates, it was expecting revenues of Rs 28,448.30 crore this year. But poor collections in the first quarter mean the BMC has so far achieved just 3.4% of this target. A note by Pradip Padwal, the BMC’s chief accountant (finance) read, “Taking into consideration the drastic reduction in actual collection, departments should reconsider all their ongoing and forthcoming projects and prepare a priority list.”Octroi used to be the BMC’s biggest source of income but was replaced by GST. Now the BMC receives compensation from the state government in lieu of octroi. Its next biggest sources of income areandand premiums. But officials said that the BMC was unlikely to meet its targets for either of these this year.Additional Municipal Commissioner P Velrasu, who holds the, said that there will be a drastic deferral of payments too. “We may not realise the payments due on time. But they are not a permanent loss. They are just deferred receipts. We have started doing an internal exercise and will definitely have a relook at the expenditure heads,” Velrasu said. He added, however, said that mega projects won’t be hit. “Major projects like the coastal road will not be affected since the BMC has specific funds for them,” he said.Butsaid the BMC was spending money with no transparency in the name of fighting the pandemic.“No meeting of the civic standing committee has been called for more than two months. The civic general body also hasn’t met. The administration is running the show on its own as far as spending money is concerned. There have been so many reports of irregularities. The municipal commissioner must cut all unnecessary expenditure and review all spending, even on Covid-19,” Shaikh said.Congress corporator Ravi Raja, leader of the opposition in the BMC, demanded that the civic body release a white paper on its finances. “Money has been spent on Covid-19 in a nontransparent manner. The BMC must come out with a white paper on the money spent on tackling Covid-19 and its financial condition. It is not going to meet its revenue targets and will have to dip into its fixed deposits. The people of the city must know that their civic body is in the red now. All unnecessary expenditure must be stopped immediately,” Raja said.In February, the BMC had unveiled its budget for 2020-21 with a total outlay of Rs 33,441 crore. It proposed a 5% increase in fees for various licences without tweaking the existing tax structure. The total budget estimate for the financial year was 8.95% more than the budgetary outlay of Rs 30,692 crore in 2019-20, which itself was 12.5% higher than the 2018-19 estimate.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-168440,msid-77009459/77009459.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmcs-april-july-income-plummets-80/articleshow/77010351.cms

Later, during a general body meeting, elected members from the NCP alleged that the purchase process was mired in irregularities, following which PCMC chief set up a body to probe the mater.“The finding has revealed that the masks supplied by Gurunoor Enterprises andwere not up to the mark. The material used did not meet the standard specified by PCMC. The report has prompted PCMC chief to take further action,” said assistant commissioner Manoj Lonkar, who was in the investigating team.Earlier, PCMC had approached state-run jails and women and child development department to provide them with masks, but they were unable to meet the huge demand of 15 lakh masks. Later, civic authorities procured a total of 17 lakh face masks from local supplier at the rate of Rs 10 per mask. At present, PCMC is directly purchasing face masks from manufacturing units.“The two suppliers roped in have provided inferior quality masks to us.

The burial ground had space and grave was dug, but this time, it was protests from residents of the area that made last rites of 86-year-old a tall taskThis was certainly not the, 86-year-old George’s family had hoped to give the. After his death at the Baptist Hospital, the family had decided to wait for his covid report before taking him for burial.The result came on Wednesday and he had tested positive. George’s son and volunteers of Mercy Angels had arranged for his burial at the MS Palya Cemetery. Even the grave was dug. But, the 86-year-old’s last journey was not to be that easy.As soon as residents of MS Palya got the news that awas to be buried in the cemetery, they gathered forces. When the ambulance with the body, and volunteers of Mercy Angels and his son reached MS Palya, an irate group was there, with stones in their hands to pelt the ambulance with stones.For days, BM has been pointing out that cremation and burial foris becoming a tall task, with lack of space, grave-diggers’ noncooperation and finally on Wednesday, resistance from the locals, pushed the bereaved family to despair.George had died on Sunday at Baptist Hospital and since the hospital suspected it to be a covid case, had taken the swab and asked the family to take the body and follow. A volunteer from Mercy Angels said the family members were planning to take the body to their house to perform the ceremony but decided to wait till the covid results were out. “On Wednesday, the results came positive and the family reached out to us to carry out the final burial. We had planned it ahead and after getting a letter from their priest, the burial ground in MS Palya was informed. Even the grave was dug on Wednesday.”The volunteer said that Tanveer Ahmed, a member of Mercy Mission and his team, arrived at the ground around 10:30 am when around 50 - 60 local residents gathered there and staged a protest. Vidyaranyapura police rushed to the spot and learnt that the locals had heard about the arrangements for the burial of a covid patient and decided to block the road.A senior officer said, “The situation was tense as the locals were threatening to pelt them with stones but it was brought under control quickly and no damage was done. The locals were scared as it is a residential area.”The volunteer said they tried to convince the locals, but they did not relent. “At 1 pm, we decided to look for another Christian burial ground. We returned to Baptist Hospital to request them to keep the body in mortuary till 5 pm as it had been over three hours and the body would start decomposing. But the hospital refused to give space and we had to arrange for a freezer to keep the body in it,” he said.The death of a loved one, and the inability to give the patriarch a dignified burial several hours after his death had by then driven the family members to the edge of despair. After waiting for hours, the family managed to get permission from their priest to carry out the burial atground. “Grave digging work was delayed due to the heavy rain, the team managed to carry it out before 6 pm while the family stood far and witnessed it,” said the volunteer.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-889471,msid-77007919/77007919.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/a-bitter-final-farewell/articleshow/77010367.cms
28,['17/07/2020'],Quick reboot at country’s biggest computer market,"(This story is part of a series in association with Facebook. Facebook has no editorial role in this story.)

If work-from-home is the new normal, computers are the new essentials . In Nehru Place – the biggest market for IT products in the country – the crowd is back for laptops, desktops and headphones, because home is now both school and office.There is a pent-up demand for computers, say shopkeepers. After a slow first week in June, when most visits were for repairs, business picked up quickly. By the end of June, the footfalls had touched 50-60% of the March level, the market association says. And this was without the Delhi Metro Before the lockdown , 3-3.5 lakh customers came to the market every day through the Nehru Place and Nehru Enclave metro stations, said Mahinder Aggarwal, president of the market association. Once metro services resume, shopkeepers expect thousands more to troop in.Amid the market’s concrete blocks, the only obvious change since March is the masks on every face. Stalls that sold screen guards, phone covers and even clothes are all there. Aggarwal said their June turnover was thrice as much as in March, and they also paid thrice the GST.“Covid has confined people to their homes, making laptops and desktops a must-have,” said Aggarwal. “Students taking online classes need a system to work on. Adults are also working from home, so the demand for laptops and desktops is very high. And if a device breaks down, they rush here for repairs.”Sanjay Nigam, who sells phone covers, said people initially came only for urgent needs, but now he also gets 20-25 customers daily. “It is a sign of normality. If the metro reopens, business will grow further.” He is worried about his leftover Chinese stock, though. “We are not getting any new Chinese products, but the old stock needs to be sold. We can’t let it go to waste, but we will need alternatives too.” Many other shopkeepers TOI spoke to also said they expect the rush to grow.Arshdeep Kaur, who had come to get her phone repaired, said she can’t do without it while working from home. “My phone’s battery stopped working last night and the first thing I did today was rush here to get it changed.” Wasn’t she worried about the crowd? “You can go out with the right precautions,” she said.Varun Madaan needs more visitors like her. He is one of the many roving ‘agents’ who earn a living by talking people into visiting the shops that pay them a cut. He says the first few days after reopening were as bad as the lockdown for him, but now he earns enough to eat three meals a day and save some money too.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77003897,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1084128,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/quick-reboot-at-countrys-biggest-computer-market/articleshow/77003880.cms
29,['17/07/2020'],China economy returned to growth last quarter as virus eased,"The Chinese economy returned to growth in the second quarter, marking an important milestone in the global struggle to recover from the coronavirus pandemic Gross domestic product expanded 3.2% in the three months to June from a year ago, reversing a 6.8% decline in the first quarter and beating the median forecast of 2.4%. In the first half however, output is still down 1.6% on the same period in 2019.Having shut its economy in the first quarter to arrest the virus spread and managed so far to largely defeat subsequent outbreaks, China is claiming global leadership in dealing with the deadly disease. Yet a conservative stimulus approach has produced only a modest domestic recovery, and one that remains highly vulnerable to setbacks in external demand as shutdowns continue to hamper global activity.Further details from Thursday's data release:“The recovery in 2Q is strong, but also highly uneven” as the supply recovery is stronger than demand, and investment is stronger than consumption, according to Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Bank Ltd. “Looking ahead, while the growth momentum would slow inevitably, GDP growth could rebound to around 5% on year in the second half” of 2020, he said.Today's data showed the recovery is still largely industry-driven, while consumer sentiment is weaker than expected. A raft of measures have been rolled out since the pandemic to shore up the economy, including tax and fee cuts, cheaper loans, and increased fiscal spending. Stimulus has still fallen far short of the policies offered in developed economies, out of concern for debt buildup and financial stability.“China's economy has gradually overcome the negative impact brought by the virus in the first half, showing recovery momentum,” Liu Aihua, NBS spokesperson, said in Beijing after the data was released. “The recovery of the domestic economic recovery still faces pressure amid rising external challenges, as the coronavirus continues to impact the global economy,”A major headwind to the recovery is the level of unemployment created by the collapse in manufacturing in the first quarter. The surveyed unemployment rate doesn't capture the full impact, and tens of millions may still be out of work due to the pandemic.Policy makers are also signaling that monetary and fiscal policy won't become much more supportive, as long as credit growth continues its upward trend.“Not out of the woods” is how Helen Qiao, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's chief economist for Greater China , described today's numbers. She told Bloomberg Television that retail sales are clearly lagging the recovery in other parts of the economy.“People still hold a fear against going out and traveling,” and the service sector is continuing to feel pain, she said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77008699,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-322103,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/china-economy-returned-to-growth-last-quarter-as-virus-eased/articleshow/77008671.cms
30,['17/07/2020'],Narendra Modi: Spend big on infra for revival: Advisers to PM,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s key economic advisors have proposed an investment-led stimulus by the government to help revive the economy. The proposed massive spending on infrastructure, along with an upgrade of urban facilities, is expected to create durable assets and jobs, and generate demand for cement and steel.

While NITI Aayog, the Economic Advisory Council (EAC) to the PM and the chief economic advisor had made detailed presentations to Modi. On Thursday, the finance ministry presented its assessment of the economy and suggestions for scripting an economic turnaround .

Some of the advisors suggested that the government should not be bogged down by “unreasonable” fiscal deficit targets, given the unprecedented crisis as the priority is to revive growth, especially when money is lying idle with the private sector unlikely to lead investment, sources told TOI.

While asset monetization and speedy disinvestment can help reduce the gap and boost spending, the need to focus on higher expenditure as the way out of the current economic situation is being recognized. The focus should also be on projects which can deliver results in one or two years under the Atmanirbhar Bharat drive.

Officials argued that the Rs 20 lakh Atmanirbhar Bharat package, which saw only around 1% higher government spending, had met the results as the economy was not ready to deal with greater spending on infrastructure creation at that time.

Most economists have estimated a 5% contraction during the first quarter, with even the government and RBI not ruling out lower economic output during the entire financial year — which will be a first in over four decades.

While the EAC to PM headed by Bibek Debroy was split on how to get the economy back on track, the NITI Aayog has suggested that the government could significantly step up investments in railways, ports, airports, logistics and connecting state capitals through a more extensive road network.

The presentation by chief economic adviser KV Subramanian and principal economic adviser Sanjeev Sanyal dentified urbanization as a focus area, while providing an assessment of the macro-economic situation, sources said.

A key theme, including in the finance ministry’s assessment, is to channelize resources in areas which provide quick results. While the Rs 100 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline will prove the much-needed impetus to productive asset creation, some of the projects are seen to be long-gestation and may take years to implement.

Government sources said that projects also need to be implemented quickly unlike those such as the Dedicated Freight Corridor, which has been under-construction for years and is running behind schedule. “It has to be a government spending led revival,"" said a source.

There is also a recognition that deficit monetization, which actually means the Reserve Bank of India printing money, should be an option to fund the massive infrastructure push. An aggressive push for privatization of state-run companies has also been suggested as a means to ramp up funds and get rid of inefficiencies in public sector enterprises. A final decision on the shape and actual contours of the package will be taken by the PM, sources said.

“An amount of Rs 37.26 crore as cooking cost has already been sanctioned by the state government. It has to be transferred to the accounts of beneficiary students as per guidelines of the Union government. As some students did not have any operative bank account, around Rs 14 crore is lying with the respective schools,” Singla said.

PATIALA: The Northern Railway has completed the electrification work of 130-km section in Punjab and Haryana, which will ensure that no more diesel locomotives are used in the stretch. The electrified lines include 62-km-long Dhuri (Punjab)-Jakhal (Haryana) line and the 68-km Dhuri-Lehra Muhabbat single line in Ambala division. A speed trial for up to 120 kmph was also done in these sections.

The Dhuri-Jakhal section in the significant Ludhiana-Dhuri-Jakhal line is a railway line connecting Ludhiana in Punjab and Jakhal in Haryana. The Dhuri-Lehra Muhabbat section falls in the Rajpura-Bhatinda line and will be significant as it will improve mobility. ""While we have electrified major routes on northern railways, there are patches where our trains get delayed because the electric locomotive has to be changed to diesel on them. With the electrification of these sections, it will be a seamless travel, there will be no delays and above all, it will save energy. This is a significant move of the railways towards 100% electrification,"" an official said.

Inspections of the sections were carried out by chief commissioner of railway safety Shailesh Kumar Pathak. Pathak. He conducted detailed safety inspections of the sections using motor trolley. Later, current collection tests and speed trials by electric locomotive were also done. The speed trial between Jakhal-Dhuri and Lehra Muhabbat-Dhuri sections with up to 120 km per hour was recorded successfully, the statement said.

The tests were done using Oliver-G technology which is a type of ‘over-head line' inspection with video recording and GPS marking system for current collection.

It is a highly reliable technology for ensuring spark-free current collection. Several other structures like ROBs, RUBs, level crossings and FOBs on the line were also checked during the inspection. The CCRS also inspected the railway stations and their amenities located on the sections.

Similarly, fatalities from road accidents declined by 26.77% during the January and June period, while the cases of injuries to people saw an impressive dip of 26.88%.

Sharing the information, Navdeep Singh Virk, additional director general of police (law and order), said the reduction in road mishaps and fatalities has been possible on account of better traffic safety measures, including improved enforcement of traffic regulations by the field units. However, the lockdown enforced to contain the spread of Covid-19 starting March 24 also contributed significantly to the dip in accidents.

According to Virk, the number of road mishaps between January and June this year came down to 4,024 from 5,491 in 2019, showing a fall of 1,467 incidents. The count of casualties also went down by 678 cases, from 2,532 in 2019 to 1,854 in 2020.

Similarly, the number of cases of people receiving injuries also came down by 1,247 to 3,391 this year from 4,638 recorded in the January-June period in 2019. ""The police in consultation with different stakeholders have been working on remedial measures like identifying black spots and getting them rectified on priority, improving the conditions of roads and putting up signage.

There is a huge trust deficit between the two sides after the bloody clashes in Galwan Valley on June 15 and accounts for the Indian emphasis on verification.The carefully worded statement came a day after the high-powered China Study Group, which includes national security adviser Ajit Doval, foreign minister S Jaishankar and Army chief Gen M M Naravane , reviewed the outcome of the July 14 talks and discussed the future strategy, as reported by TOI on Thursday.The statement significantly did not mention the word ‘de-escalation’ to clearly imply that the mutual withdrawal of troops, tanks, artillery guns and other heavy weaponry from the ‘rear areas’ along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is not on the cards for now.The foreign ministry on Thursday said the disengagement process currently under way was ""specifically aimed at addressing face-off situations and close-up deployments"" between the rival troops. ""Both sides have agreed at specific points to re-deploy towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC. These are mutually agreed reciprocal actions to be taken by both sides. It is an ongoing process,"" it said.This mutual re-deployment should not be ""misrepresented"" since there is ""absolutely no change"" with respect to India’s position. ""Any unilateral attempts to change the status quo along the LAC are not acceptable,"" the ministry said.Sources said only the troop disengagement at ""Patrolling Point-14 (PP-14)"" in Galwan Valley, the site of the June 15 clashes, has been fully completed to India’s satisfaction till now, with all PLA troops withdrawing to their side of the LAC.There is also substantial progress at the face-off sites at PP-15 and 17A in the Gogra-Hot Springs area, with the bulk of the rival troops mutually pulling back to create temporary no-patrolling zones extending 2-3 km. ""A further pullback has been agreed to for complete disengagement in these areas,"" a source said.The north bank of Pangong Tso, however, remains the major problem. PLA troops have so far only moved back from the face-off site at the ""base"" of ""Finger-4"" to ""Finger-5"" (mountainous spurs), without fully vacating the ridgeline that dominates the area.India wants the PLA soldiers to move back by about 8km to their bases at Sirijap-I and II to the east of ""Finger-8"", where the LAC runs north to south. Indian troops have also moved back westwards towards their Dhan Singh Thapa post between ""Finger-2"" and ""Finger-3"".Apart from the face-off sites, another major concern is the way the PLA is continuing to block Indian soldiers from going to their traditional ""Patrolling Points 10, 11, 12 and 13"" in the Depsang Plains — a strategically located tabletop plateau to the north of Galwan — after intruding deep into what India considers its territory. India is pushing for the ""old norm"" of not blocking each other’s patrols to be restored in the Depsang area.The eventual de-induction of the around 30,000 troops and heavy weaponry amassed by the two sides in the ""depth areas"" along the 1,597km frontier in eastern Ladakh is still nowhere on the horizon.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77008895,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-275432,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-to-verify-chinese-pullback-over-next-10-days/articleshow/77008903.cms

While Maharashtra as usual led the count with 266 deaths — its second-highest 24-hour toll so far — Karnataka saw a huge spike in fatalities, adding 104 to its toll. It became the third state, after Maharashtra and Delhi, to register 100 deaths in a single day.The day’s toll was also high in Tamil Nadu (69), Delhi (58), Andhra Pradesh (40), Uttar Pradesh (34), Bengal (23) and J&K (16).In what would be another record, at least 11 states reported their highest single-day surge in cases, led by Maharashtra, which recorded a massive 8,641 new infections. The others were Tamil Nadu (4,549), Karnataka (4,169), Andhra Pradesh (2,593), Uttar Pradesh (2,083), Bengal (1,690), Bihar (also 1,690), Kerala (722), J&K (490), Jharkhand (381 since Wednesday night) and Chhattisgarh (218).Amid a major spike in the pandemic in the state, Karnataka became the third state to log 4,000 or more cases in a day, nearly 1,000 more than Wednesday’s number. The state also crossed 50,000 cases and 1,000 deaths.Breaking all previous records, Maharashtra on Thursday added 8,641 new Covid-19 cases, its highest single-day addition since the pandemic broke. The previous highest was 8,139 cases reported on July 11. The state’s case tally on Thursday reached 2,84,281, very close to the 3 lakh mark. The state also reported 266 deaths, the second-highest toll for a day so far, taking the total toll past 11,000.Mumbai reported an increase in the number of cases compared to the last few days, adding 1,476 new ones. Mumbai now has 97,950 cases. Of the 266 deaths in the state, 56 were reported from Mumbai, which contributed 21% of the daily addition. A civic official said since the easing of the lockdown, a bulk of new infections were coming from non-slum pockets. Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) added twice the number of cases and deaths than Mumbai.Even as fresh cases rose to a new high in Tamil Nadu, Chennai continued to report declining numbers. As Chennai detected 1,157 cases on Thursday, a mathematical model suggested that the infection was no more an epidemic in the city. “Technically, it is no longer an epidemic in the city. If Chennai manages to prevent any new clusters from increasing the growth rate again, we could end up with all patients recovered by a couple of weeks,” an expert said.Telangana recorded 10 deaths and 1,676 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, taking the total tally of cases beyond the 40,000 mark. Telangana also set a new record in Covid-19 testing with 14,027 samples tested on Thursday, the single-day highest so far.

Madhya Pradesh has scored ‘1’ on the overall vulnerability scale while Bihar’s vulnerability is calculated to be 0.971.While focussing on the exodus of migrant workers from cities during the lockdown, the study says, “most of these people travelled to UP and Bihar, followed by MP, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, J&K and West Bengal . And, indeed, we observed that these are some of the most vulnerable states according to the vulnerability indices.”According to the researchers, MP has the highest vulnerability due to housing and hygiene condition (0.971) which is highest among all states. Also, vulnerability is high due to socio economic conditions (0.886) and weak healthcare infrastructure (0.857).Bihar’s weak link is non-availability of healthcare (0.971). It fared poorly on hygiene (0.800) and socio-economic conditions (0.714) as well.“The objective of the study is to see how vulnerable the population is to the effects of the pandemic.

37,['17/07/2020'],Driving licence rules: Norms for temporary registration no in new vehicles kicks in,"NEW DELHI: Driving a new vehicle with a temporary registration number written on a piece of paper and pasted on the vehicle is now an offence. The road transport ministry on Wednesday notified a comprehensive norm for colour code for alphanumeric details and for the background portion used for displaying the registration number of 11 categories of vehicles.

The two new inclusions in the list are vehicles with temporary number plates and the ones in possession of dealers. The changes have been made under the Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR), which prohibits using any alphabet except capital letters in English and Arabic numerals on the number plate. It also says nothing else must be written on it.

This means it’s illegal if any motor vehicle displays registration details in regional language or in small letter. “Even VIP registration numbers auctioned by states must comply with the norms,” said an official.

The CMVR specifies the dimensions of the number and alphabets to be written on any number plate. For example, in the case of all motor vehicles except two and three wheelers, the height, thickness and space have been specified at 65 mm, 10 mm and 10 mm respectively.

“Uniformity of all number plates is very essential for enforcement of rules. The cameras with automating number plate readers cannot read those which don’t conform to the norm,” said Anil Chikara a Delhi transport department official specialising in motor vehicle licencing.

He added that there have been numerous instances of criminals misusing vehicle with temporary registration numbers to commit crime. “It’s difficult to read the details printed on a piece of paper from a little distance and one can easily remove it at convenience. The notification has brought greater clarity,” Chikara said.

Though nation-wide implementation of High Security Registration Plate (HSRP) will put an end to the current practice of people flouting norm, several states are yet to implement this.

The road transport ministry said that the notification has been brought to bring clarity in respect of an amendment notified in June 1989 on “The assignment of registration mark on vehicles for various States and Union Territories at a glimpse”.

NEW DELHI: After exhausting judicial remedies against his extradition to India, fugitive former liquor baron Vijay Mallya 's counsel on Thursday told the Supreme Court that he has offered a comprehensive settlement package to the consortium of banks and that if it is accepted then all the cases against him by Enforcement Directorate would be sorted out.Though the counsel did not mention the quantum of settlement before a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, sources said Mallya has filed a petition before the SC last month offering a settlement package of Rs 13,960 crores for full and final payment of the principal defaulted amount in excess of Rs 9,000 crore. This is the highest offer Mallya has ever made for settlement of dispute with consortium of banks and closure of money laundering cases under PMLA registered by ED.But, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said Mallya had a habit of giving such offers from time to time. ""This is one of the many carrots Mallya had dangled at the end of a stick from time to time. Let him deposit the money before coming to India,"" he said, giving a hint that Mallya could be extradited to India soon. Mallya has reportedly sought asylum in the UK after losing battle against extradition in multiple courts there.A Delhi court had in 2016 issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Mallya for repeated non-appearance in an ED case even as the SC had pulled up Mallya for non-disclosure of his assets during the hearing of the petition by consortium of banks for recovery of debts. In March 2016, Mallya had offered to deposit Rs 4,000 crore as settlement, which included pending suits by his companies including the now defunct Kingfisher Airlines for settlement. A month later, he had increased the offer to Rs 6.868 crore.Recently, he tweeted - ""Congratulations to the government for Covid-19 relief package. They can print as much currency as they want.

The plea was accepted despite opposition from Congress counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi and advocate general MS Singhvi, representing the Speaker.Follow TOI's live blog for latest updates on Rajasthan political crisisThe original petition had only challenged the notices issued by Speaker CP Joshi on the basis of a complaint filed by Congress against Pilot and his loyalists, accusing them of conspiring with BJP to topple the Ashok Gehlot government. The division bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta will take up the amended joint petition on Friday.According to the petition, which lists Pilot as petitioner No. 7, all 19 MLAs who have been served notices by the Speaker are still with Congress and none of them has given up assembly membership. The petition mentions that Pilot had already issued multiple statements saying he had no intention of leaving Congress.The MLAs’ petition argues that the Speaker should have given them at least a week’s time to respond to the allegations against them instead of just two days (till 3pm on July 17). “Grave mischief is sought to be achieved by the prejudicial manner in which the CLP is seeking to impose sanctions upon the MLAs on sheer presumptuous basis, as the complaint (by Congress chief whip) is dated July 14 and the showcause notice is issued (by the speaker) on the same day,” the petition states.The MLAs accused Gehlot of trying to threaten them through an inquiry by the Special Operations Group (SOG) so that they wouldn’t raise their voices against “the inefficiency of leadership within the party”.On being taken to task for not attending CLP meetings, the Pilot camp has said that skipping party conclaves cannot be considered tantamount to inviting disqualification on grounds of defection.Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi reached the court with an impleadment application, saying he should be made party to the case as the Speaker had issued notices based on his petition filed under para 2(1)A of Schedule X of the Constitution.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77009379,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-37498,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sachin-pilot-18-mlas-move-hc-against-anti-defection-notices/articleshow/77009380.cms

Yadav, who has unleashed an outburst on social media, now faces inquiry for making people do sit-ups on the road and for not accepting the notice seeking explanation for remaining absent from duty since July 9. The inquiries were ordered by Surat police commissioner RB Brahmbhatt on Thursday.

The feisty policewoman is already facing an inquiry into the entire July 8 run-in with Kanani’s son Prakash and his friends whom she had confronted for violating curfew orders. The videos of the incident and her subsequent conversations with senior police officials had gone viral, making her an instant Twitter sensation.

Yadav had allegedly made some people do sit-ups for violating social distancing in Matawadi locality of Varachha in Surat, the video of which also went viral. Raju Godhani, a resident of Varachha, had also submitted an application regarding her alleged high-handed behaviour before this incident happened.

“After watching the video, I found that she is the same woman who harassed me and others in Matawadi. I had complained about her to the police before this incident happened and officers shifted her to another location. But she continued with her abrasive behaviour,” Godhani alleged.

Yadav had reportedly refused to accept the notice sent by police headquarters seeking explanation for not reporting to duty since July 9. She went on leave after the run-in with Kanani on the grounds that she was unwell. She has been absent from work since July 9 and on July 14, when a police team went to serve her a notice, she refused to accept it claiming that she doesn’t understand Gujarati.

All the three inquiries are being conducted by assistant commissioner of police JK Pandya. Her statement in the Kanani episode has been recorded.

She was also provided two armed guards at her residence for protection following her request.

MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said since 2016, despite the difficulties posed by the sanctions situation, there has been significant progress on the Chabahar Port project.

On the proposed railway line though, he said, IRCON was appointed by India to assess the feasibility of the project. It was working with CDTIC, an Iranian company under their ministry of railways in that regard, he said.

IRCON has completed the site inspection and review of the feasibility report, said the official.

"" Detailed discussions were thereafter held on other relevant aspects of the project, which had to take into account the financial challenges that Iran was facing. In December 2019, these issues were reviewed in detail at the 19th India-Iran Joint Commission Meeting in Tehran,"" Srivastava said.

""The Iranian side was to nominate an authorised entity to finalise outstanding technical and financial issues. This is still awaited,"" he said

His remarks come after media reports claimed that India has been left out of the Chabahar-Zahedan railway project in Iran. The official described the reports as speculative.

On reports regarding the Farzad-B Gas field negotiations in which ONGC was involved in the discovery stage, Srivastava said follow-up bilateral cooperation was, however, impacted by policy changes on the Iranian side.

""In January 2020, we were informed that in the immediate future, Iran would develop the field on its own and would like to involve India appropriately at a later stage. This matter remains under discussion,"" he said.

Appearing for 'Foundation for Media Professionals', senior advocate Huzefa Ahmedi told a bench of Justices N V Ramana, S R Reddy and B R Gavai that on one hand the Centre through attorney general K K Venugopal claimed that there are more number of terror attacks in the valley, but on the other hand the Union home minister had recently claimed that terrorist incidents were at its lowest since 1991.

""Who is speaking the truth,"" he asked even as he complained in the contempt petition that the Centre has miserably failed to implement the SC's May 11 order for weekly review of the situation by a high powered committee headed by Union home secretary to examine feasibility of providing faster internet services in the valley areas. ""In the absence of 4G services, the students are unable to join online classes, businessmen's trade is affected, the doctors are impeded from providing latest treatment and the citizen's right to free speech is violated,"" he said.

Appearing for the Centre and J&K administration, attorney general Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that the order is fully complied with as the high powered committee took into consideration exhaustive details of the prevalent situation and decided to continue the status quo, that is 2G internet services, for the time being.

""The minutes of the meeting run to 20 pages and records in detail the elaborate deliberations on the issue by the high powered committee. It has also asked for further investigation into the petitioner's claim of violation of rights because of denial of 4G internet. We can file in sealed cover the minutes of the meeting to satisfy the court about the genuineness of the exercise,"" the AG said.

AG said there is no ground to file a contempt petition as the very premise of the petitioner that nothing has been done by the government stands repudiated. However the bench asked the Centre to file counter affidavit to the contempt petition and posted the matter for further hearing next week.

Companies readying to scale up to pre-Covid levels as they start launching models or upgrades are having to grapple with frequent off-and-on local restrictions, which have thrown a spanner into production plans and hit supply lines, even though the countrywide lockdown ended on May 4.

Take for instance Honda Cars, which is targeting 100% of pre-Covid production by September. Senior VP & director (marketing & sales) Rajesh Goel said that it was not even thinking of a third shift as the market contracts and ramp-up plans are disrupted by local lockdowns.

“In the past one week there have been multiple local lockdowns. So, we have to balance both the pandemic risk as well as supply & demand. Our factories started production on June 15 and we did 25% of pre-Covid production in June, and have hit 60% in July,” he added.

Sometimes, quick changes in administrative decisions also mean employees return to their hometowns and villages and take time to get back to work schedules. “Timely and clear instructions will help industrial units plan their production cycles and logistics, including work force and raw material movement. The fact is that it takes a lot of preparation in reopening large manufacturing units and involves the participation of everyone in the value chain. Complete clarity and adequate time to start or stop operations will go a long way in helping the manufacturing sector plan their business activities in a proper and safe manner,” said Toyota Kirloskar Motor senior vice president (sales & services) Naveen Soni.

While Bihar has announced a total lockdown, Jharkhand is contemplating one. Cities like Pune and Bengaluru too have imposed lockdowns, partial or total. With the situation so fluid, car companies say they cannot really plan even month on month and have to take it week-by-week. For example, Hyundai plans to ramp up to a third shift production, but with the rider that there should not be any more disruptions, said Hyundai Motor India director (sales, marketing & service) Tarun Garg. What makes this uncertainty worse is that the car industry has been battling both a slowdown and Covid-triggered demand disruptions. Which is why companies are still talking about hitting pre-Covid levels, not peak capacity.

Car marketers also say the dealer network too is impacted by local lockdowns as the whole process of getting a dealership to open shop afterwards takes time.

ICRA cuts growth forecast to -9.5%

With the economy not restarting as anticipated in July 2020, rating agency ICRA has sharply revised its forecast for the contraction in the country’s GDP to 9.5% in FY21 from 5%. ICRA has attributed this to the climbing Covid-19 infections, resulting in a spate of lockdowns, arresting the nascent recovery made in May and June.

PATNA: Be prepared to pay hefty fines if you are caught parking your vehicle on the premises of the Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport on Shaheed Peer Ali Marg in the state capital from Friday.

After a videoconference with the members of the Airport Environment Management Committee (AEMC) and others on Thursday, Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said, “People will be issued challans for unauthorized parking on both sides of the Peer Ali Marg near the airport from July 17.”

Agarwal, who is also the chairperson of the AEMC, asked city traffic superintendent of police (SP) D Amarkesh to depute men outside the airport to keep tabs on people who parked their vehicles in no-parking zones.

“Keeping in mind security reasons and the problem of traffic congestion, no unauthorized parking will be allowed near the airport. Challans will be issued to the violators,” the divisional commissioner said and added that the Airports Authority of India (Patna) had raised the issue of traffic snarls on the airport road.

Agarwal directed Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Himanshu Sharma to get street lights installed along the boundary wall of the Patna zoo near the airport.

He also asked the civic body to remove the meat and fish shops at Phulwarisharif due to bird hit cases reported by the airport officials.

“Pruning of trees near the airport and the zoo will be done by August 15 to make sure that flights land and take off safely,” he said.

The meeting was virtually attended by the Patna Municipal Commissioner (PMC) commissioner, trafficsuperintendent of police (SP) , airport director Bhupesh C H Negi, Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials and CISF commandant among other stakeholders.

51,['17/07/2020'],Patna roads wear a deserted look on Day 1 of fresh lockdown,"A view of deserted Auto-rickshaw stand near Kargil Chowk in Patna

PATNA: Patna once again came to a standstill with roads wearing a deserted look and multiple police checkpoints coming up on the first day of 16-day lockdown enforced by the state government to break Covid-19 chain on Thursday.

Police constables and traffic cops were seen stopping motorists to ascertain if they were travelling for valid reasons. Even Bailey Road, Boring Road, Ashok Rajpath, Exhibition Road and Gandhi Maidan areas did not see any major vehicle or pedestrian movement. All shops, except those selling essential commodities, remained shut. Milk, medicine, meat shops were open and vegetable and fruit vendors were also seen doing business along the roads.

City SP (central) incharge D Amarkesh said police personnel have been deputed at 50 checkpoints in the district and traffic police keep checking the vehicles throughout the day.

“Local police stations have been asked to ensure that shops close and open on the time allotted by the district administration, people maintain social distancing and wear masks,” Amarkesh said.

Since residents were informed about the lockdown two days in advance, they stocked up essential items. Those living in containment zones, however, found it difficult to buy even essential commodities.

Aniket Prakash, who lives in Gurhata in Patna City , said medicine and grocery shops remained shut throughout the day. “We can’t go beyond the sealed area,” he added.

Prince Mishra, a resident of Bhattacharya Road, said shopkeepers in the area kept their shutters down due to fear. “As the shops were closed, I had to walk a few miles to get the grocery items,” he said.

Marketplaces, shopping malls, religious places, public places (restaurants, eateries, zoo and parks), private offices and other establishments remained shut. Restaurants are allowed for takeaways and home deliveries. Though mobile repair shops and garages have been exempted from the purview of lockdown, very few were open on Thursday.

Manoj Singh, sales executive at a mobile repair shop, said, “I don’t think we are going to get any customer during the lockdown period.”

Some pre-paid taxis and autorickshaws were seen running on roads. Sanjay Rathi, driver of a private taxi, said, “I got only one passenger for Patna airport and two for Patna Junction.”

Meanwhile, the Bihar Chemists and Druggists Association has asked owners of medicine shops on Govind Mitra road to keep their shutters down on Saturday and Sunday when the area will be disinfected by the civic body.

52,['17/07/2020'],"Five teachers test +ve, raise scare","Jaipur: Despite the government’s prohibition, private schools are calling their teaching staff to school which has proved to be dangerous. On Saturday, five teachers of a private school here tested Covid positive.

Private schools have started calling teachers to the institutes everyday either for online classes or just to mark their attendance. As online classes are going on, teachers are finding it difficult to work from home with no facilities and data problems.

A private school teacher who did not wish to be named said, “Our school had asked teachers who are facing problems to come to school and work from computer labs. We are okay with it but the news of school teachers testing positive has scared us. If we test positive, who will take care of us financially.”

Many schools have made it mandatory for the 50% teaching and non-teaching staff to come to school every day. Most of the institutes are calling teachers just to mark their attendance in the register.

Sushil Sharma, president of Rajasthan Abhibhavak Sangh said, “Private schools and the government must be cautious about this situation. There are discussions of opening of schools within three months but when teachers are affected with coronavirus, how can the students be safe. These are difficult times.”

The school where teachers were found positive have since shut down their campus and no one is allowed inside anymore. All the teachers have been home-quarantined.

PATNA: The state government on Thursday refuted reports that the Sattarghat Mahasetu in Gopalganj district, which was made operational on June 15, was washed away, claiming that only a portion of an approach road to a minor bridge was damaged.

A press communique issued by the road construction department said, “The Sattarghat bridge has not been damaged. Nearly 2km away from it, an approach road to another small bridge was damaged by the swollen Gandak. This happened due to unprecedented pressure of water in the river.”

“The main Sattarghat bridge is totally intact. There is no question of misappropriation of funds in this project and this is a natural disaster,” the government press release said, adding the damaged portion would be repaired after the flood situation improves.

Road construction department minister Nand Kishore Yadav, who was criticised by RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, said,” The RJD leader has no moral right to say anything on the issue of corruption. The Sattargahat bridge is intact and only an approach road to a small bridge is damaged.”

The government also released a video to show that the 1,440-metre-long Sattarghat bridge. Sources said more than three lakh cusecs of water were released in the river Gandak suddenly, which increased pressure on the small bridge.

However, locals said the link between Gopalganj to East Champaran and Muzaffarpur district has been snapped due to the damage caused to the approach road of the minor bridge. “It will take time to repair the damaged portion of the approach road. The repair work doesn’t take place during monsoon,” said Munna Singh , a resident of Bhore in Gopalganj district.

The Sattarghat Mahasetu was inaugurated by CM Nitish Kumar on June 15 through videoconferencing amid Covid-19 pandemic.

The four members, three of whom are senior citizens, told the court that the association has not received any permission from the district collector or the police commissioner. The meeting will start online but will be adjourned so that the members can pass two resolutions including passing accounts of 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 and appointment of statutory auditors for 2019-20.

BCA will get a pending grant of Rs 120 crore from the BCCI once the accounts are passed by the members. Five venues have been decided where the members will have to go with their biometric cards or any government identity card to vote.

In their petition, the petitioners have stated that of the 2,300 members of the association, 30% are senior citizens, who as per the guidelines of Covid-19 are advised not to go out in public. The petition also states that one of the petitioners – Kalpesh Parmar – had filed objections to which he did not receive any response initially.

The court has also been told that there is no direction from any court or authority to finish the AGM in stipulated time so the AGM can be conducted at leisure and as and when the situation permits. The petitioners have also written to police commissioner raising objections against granting of permission. tnn

56,['17/07/2020'],Patna: Getting tested for Covid-19 a ‘Herculean’ task,"PATNA: With the Covid-19 cases in Bihar crossing the 20,000 mark, getting tested for the virus has become a herculean task in the state capital.While two major private labs have stopped their Covid testing services, others have made it mandatory for people to get the test recommended by a doctor. At government hospitals, there is a huge rush and tests are being done only after approval from the in-house doctors.Healthcare workers falling prey to Covid-19 is adding another dimension to the problem. The Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), which was doing around 700 tests in a day, is now barely able to test around 200 samples as 17 of its staffers at the virology lab have tested positive. To top that the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRI) in Patna is closed for the past three days to carry out sanitisation of its premises.No wonder the queues are getting longer, despite claims to the contrary by the state health department that symptomatic persons or those who have come in contact with a positive person will be tested on a priority basis. Even the wait time for reports, especially for RT-PCR tests, are getting longer, taking up to 10 days now.A deputy collector rank officer in Patna had to opt for a private lab, after he could not get his sample tested at the PMCH as well as the NMCH despite several calls to senior officials.However, state health department secretary Lokesh Kumar said anyone who is symptomatic, or those who have come in touch with a Covid-19 positive person can get their tests done at government facilities. “We are also doing random testing,” Lokesh added.Kankarbagh resident Vishakha Ranjan recalled the horror her family had to go through after her father’s colleague tested positive for Covid-19. “My father’s sample was also taken and we were told it was negative. But then we got a call from the civil surgeon’s office saying he was positive and will be sent to a quarantine centre. There was so much chaos and confusion. How could we send a person who has tested negative to stay with positive ones,” asked Vishakha.A video went viral on Wednesday showing people creating ruckus at the Patliputra hotel in Patna, an isolation centre, to get their application forms submitted for Covid-19 test. They claimed their forms were not being accepted.“I kept running from one place to another. Finally, I was shown to the ‘flu corner’, but no one took my sample. People say only jugaad will work,” said a Bakarganj resident, who refused to be named, adding he had a bitter experience at the PMCH earlier in the week when he took his elderly aunt for her Covid test.Manoj Kumar (name changed) who went to PMCH earlier this week to get himself tested, said, “No one was taking samples. Some were saying the staff is on strike. Climbing mountains is easier than getting tested for Covod-19 at government hospitals here.”Getting tested is not an easy task even at private labs. Beijing-based Alok Gupta, who is trying to get two of his family members tested, said, “My brother-in-law and his mother are highly symptomatic. Both have fever for the past three days and we are trying our best to get them tested, but to no avail. Even a private lab we are in touch with has asked them to come on July 20. Aunty is too old and it is not safe to move around with her in this situation.”Data on tests per million shared by NITI Ayog CEO Amitabh Kant on July 4 had placed Bihar at the bottom of the list with just 2,179 tests per million, which was 15 times less than Delhi. Kant had stressed the need for more tests in his tweet.According to the state health department, on July 15, 10,052 samples were tested, which account for 2,762 tests per million, a marginal increase.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77012017,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-187378,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/getting-tested-for-covid-19-a-herculean-task/articleshow/77006824.cms

PATNA: State road construction minister Nand Kishor Yadav said on Thursday that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has issued the work order for the ambitious Manihari- Sahibganj four-lane bridge over the Ganga. While Manihari is in Katihar district, Sahibganj is in neighbouring Jharkhand .

The RCD minister said that the bridge will boost road connectivity of Bihar with Jharkhand and north- eastern states as well. “Apart from being an option for direct road connectivity to Jharkhand from north Bihar, the bridge will also connect a four-lane road connecting Purnia. Thus, it will get connected with the east-west four-lane corridor connecting northeastern states,” the minister said.

He added that the bridge will be constructed utilising an estimated outlay of Rs1.9 crore over a period of four years. “The total length of the bridge project is 21.185, including the bridge structure, which will be six km long. Of the total length of the bridge project, 15.685km, including the entire stretch of the bridge will fall under Jharkhand, while remaining 5.1km stretch will be in Bihar,” Yadav added.

The road construction minister said that the construction of the bridge will benefit movement of trucks loaded with coal and stones coming from Jharkhand as they have to come via Vikramshila Setu in Bhagalpur , which is comparatively a longer route.

Deliberating upon the connectivity of the bridge with Purnia, Yadav said, “NH-131 (A) will connect the north Manihari with Purnia via Narainpur . NHAI has recently initiated the bidding process for four-laning of NH- 131 (A). The four-lane Narainpur- Purnia will be 49km long and it will be constructed tiling funds to the tune of Rs1,325crore. This project is a part of PM’s special package for Bihar, which he had announced in 2015.”

The RCD minister added that construction work on the bridge is likely to commence post- monsoon as the contractor will require some time to mobilise manpower and resources. “Construction of this bridge is expected to create over 80,000 man days for workers, which will be of muchgreat financial help for the returnee migrant labourers in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic,” Yadav said.

Club Factory is one of the 59 Chinese apps banned by the government. On Tuesday, Club Factory, which has now temporarily paused operations here, told its Indian merchants that it will settle existing dues only after the ban is lifted, triggering anger and anxiety from sellers. It has about 30,000 registered Indian sellers.Aiova’s legal counsel Chanakya Basa said they have asked Club Factory to settle dues in 48 hours. Failing which, the association will have to consider the next course of action. He also felt pausing settlements until the ban is lifted could be a ploy to nudge the government to exempt the platform’s operations.According to the notice, putting all settlements on hold due to the ban is in violation of the Payment and Settlements Act , 2007 and as well as against an RBI circular issued in March, which says payments to merchants need to be settled within one day of delivery confirmation of goods.“That your defence to continue this illegal act further by invoking force majeure ...is contrary to RBI circular dated 17.3.2020 and Payments and Settlement Systems Act, 2009. Therefore, you are hereby called upon by my clients to settle the pending dues to the sellers within 48 hours,” the notice sent on Thursday said. An email to Club Factory did not elicit any response.Since Tuesday’s development, sellers have expressed concern online over their dues — critical capital for them amid the pandemic . Typically, these are third-party independent sellers of smaller scale, unlike entities like Cloudtail or Tech Connect , that are one of the largest sellers on Amazon India and Flipkart , respectively.“Marketplaces are bound by RBI directives to keep money collected on sellers’ behalf in escrow.

60,['17/07/2020'],"Financial Security: Education and marriage can wait, now it’s savings for Covid","MUMBAI: Middle-class Indians, who were until last year worried about savings for their children’s education or marriage, are now more concerned about immediate health expenditure or loss of income following a pink slip at the workplace.There has been a dramatic change in risk perceptions since Covid-19 struck. Many of the concerns that were top of the mind for most last year have dropped off their lists as people have bigger things to worry about because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic A survey conducted by consulting firm Kantar on behalf of Max Life Insurance shows that the current level of financial security was the lowest in metros (46%), while it was the highest in tier-2 centres (55%), followed by tier-1 cities (52%). Up to 64% respondents in metros said that security of job/current business/stable income is more of a worry to them now than before Covid-19, but only 51% in tier-1 said it had become more concerning to them.“While people are now saving half their income, the concerns are more short-term. The concerns are here and now and not long-term,” said Max Life Insurance MD and CEO Prashant Tripathy. The top three objectives for savings in the post-Covid-19 world are for coronavirus treatment, for medical emergencies, and keeping aside money for loss of job or business. Kids’ education, old age security, buying a house, kids’ marriage, travel and buying a car have moved down the list.In the wake of the current situation, the survey brought to light that, in comparison to pre-Covid-19 times, consumers are saving more now, whereas investments and basic expenses have remained the same as before. While savings increased for 48% respondents in tier-1 and 38% respondents in metros, investments remained the same as before Covid-19 for 44% in tier-1 and 40% in metros.Typically, uncertainty increases the demand for insurance. But this time, the impact is mixed as people are not really thinking about retirement and are not confident enough about their income stability to make commitments for future payments. According to Tripathy, there is demand for term life insurance, which takes care of the fear of loss of the breadwinner. “One of the barriers to buying term insurance is a misconception that it is very expensive, which is not correct,” said Tripathy.According to Tripathy, Max Life has seen around 35 claims on account of Covid . “The trend is that there is an overall decline in death claims as accidental deaths are down because of the lockdown,” said Tripathy. He added that while policy renewals did get impacted due to the lockdown in April, subsequent months have seen an improvement in renewals. He also said that the company had not seen any trend of policyholders trying to encash their unit-linked policies following the pandemic.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77010924,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-68458,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/edu-marriage-can-wait-now-its-savings-for-covid/articleshow/77007646.cms
61,['17/07/2020'],Lockdown garners mixed response in districts,"PATNA: The 16-day statewide lockdown imposed by the government till July 31 to contain the spread of coronavirus garnered mixed response on Thursday.

Except for some minor violations, Day 1 of the lockdown was effective in Gaya. Since the main commercial area of the town had, earlier, been declared a containment zone, business activities on G B Road and adjoining areas were stopped much before the implementation of the lockdown.

Gaya district magistrate (DM) Abhishek Singh, who visited several areas of the town, told this newspaper, “This lockdown was far more effective than the previous one. It very much depends on the people’s response.”

Although markets remained shut in Samastipur, several people were seen roaming on the streets without masks. Private vehicles, especially three-wheelers, were also moving freely. Besides, fruit and vegetable vendors, who had been allowed to open their shops in the morning and evening, violated the norms by dealing with customers throughout the day.

In Madhubani, all shops, except for those selling essential commodities, remained shut. Roads wore a deserted look as neither buses nor other modes of transport were allowed. Even small eateries and tea stalls were closed and policemen roamed around the town on bikes to keep tabs on the activities of the locals.

District Congress general secretary Anil Nath Jha claimed that during the previous lockdowns, a general disdain for the restrictions was witnessed, but “this time people are serious owing to a surge in Covid-19 cases”.

The people of Khagaria also remained indoors and all business establishments, shops, institutions, government and private organizations followed the directives of the district administration. DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh and SP Meenu Kumari urged the people to follow the norms, “failing which stern action will be taken against the violators”.

Ara’s Gopali Chowk, the main market area of the town, wore a deserted look during the peak traffic hours on Day 1 of the lockdown. Town police station SHO Janmejai Rai and circle officer Kamal Kishore launched a vehicle and mask-checking drive on Shivganj Mor in the morning and collected fine from the violators.

“Even the small shops in the town were closed till early evening. Luckily, those, who had stepped out, were using face masks,” the SHO said.

Divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal held a meeting through videoconferencing with Patna DM Kumar Ravi, AIIMS-P administration and DMs and doctors of other districts in order to ensure plasma donation.Agarwal said plasma donation was the need of the hour. “Keeping in mind the surging cases in the city and elsewhere in the state, plasma therapy can act as a lifesaver for critical patients. Therefore, every recovered patient should voluntarily donate their plasma and contribute their bit in combating the virus,” he said.He added that those donating plasma will be felicitated. “ Altogether18 donors, including Deepak Kumar of Khajpura, the first plasma donor of the state, will be honoured as ‘ Corona Warrior’ by the district administration.

Hence, we expect more people to come forward in the coming days. The therapy involves injecting critical Covid-19 patients with blood plasma from those who have recovered as it has the tendency to fight the virus if injected in other positive patients,” she said.She added that a ‘Thank You’ card will be given to the donors, which will help them receive one unit blood whenever required in a year.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77012196,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-73743,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/20-more-to-donate-plasma-at-aiims-p/articleshow/77006398.cms

An appeal bench of Justices R D Dhanuka and V G Bisht declined to intervene in the order that had said prima facie HUL was a “prior adopter” of the trademark, observing that Emami had been given liberty to move the single judge to vary its ad-interim order, passed ex-parte, after giving 48 hours notice to HUL.

Justice B P Colabawala of the Bombay HC had on July 6 noted that HUL had already started “commercial advertisements” over the men’s skin care cream and had directed Emami to give a prior seven-day written notice before launching any trademark legal battle over use of ‘Glow & Handsome’. Soon after that order, Emami did issue a notice and filed a trademark infringement suit against HUL before the Calcutta high court .

Ironically enough, fatality rate among Covid-19 patients in Mysuru is almost twice as high as the state’s average at 3.9%, a number that has the authorities in the district a worried lot.In all, 50 people have fallen prey to the novel coronavirus in Mysuru district, where the Covid-19 cases have surged to 1320 largely owing to the spurt in the past week, during which time 733 cases have been confirmed. Even more interestingly, Chikkamagaluru , which has so far had only seven people succumbing to the pandemic, has a Covid fatality rate of 4.1%, placing it second only to Bidar (4.5%).The Covid tally in Mysuru and Kodagu districts has been climbing at a rate considerably higher than the state average. Between July 10 and July 15, the number of cases in Mysuru rose by 11.5%, jumped by 11.1% in Kodagu, both figures being considerably higher than the spike in the state (7.2%). However, authorities have attributed the spike to the huge backlog of untested samples at the Covid-19 laboratory in Kodagu .Mysuru deputy commissioner Abhiram G Sankar attributed the high fatality rate in the district to delayed admission and comorbidities among the patients. In the past fortnight, more than 46 people have succumbed to the novel coronavirus in Mysuru, nearly all of whom had a history of respiratory illnesses or other disorders.Sankar pointed to the rise in the number of people with influenza-like-illnesses testing positive for the novel coronavirus across the state, adding that the trend had been observed in Mangaluru, Ballari and Hubballi too.Kodagu DC Annies Kanmani Joy said that the spurt in the Covid-19 case in the hilly district was owing to a pausein the testing of samples. “After a member of the team that was testing samples tested positive, the others were quarantined at home. By the time another team took over, the number of samples had accumulated, which is why the number of people being confirmed infected has also risen sharply in the past week,” said Kanmani. Since two days positive cases are around a dozen.Chikkamagaluru DC Bagadi Gautham said that, of the seven Covid fatalities in the district, three people had been declared ‘brought dead’ at the designated hospital, while two had passed away within 24 hours of their being hospitalised. “The other two patients had had problems in their lungs.

71,['17/07/2020'],ICRA cuts growth forecast to -9.5%,"TNN

Mumbai: With the economy not restarting as anticipated in July 2020, rating agency ICRA has sharply revised its forecast for the contraction in the country’s GDP to 9.5% in FY21 from its earlier assessment of 5%. ICRA has attributed this to the climbing Covid-19 infections, resulting in a spate of lockdowns in some states and cities, arresting the nascent recovery made in May and June.

“The Indian economy had started to recover from the troughs experienced in April 2020, when the lockdown was at its severest, and many sectors seemed to be adjusting to a new normal. However, the unabated rise in Covid-19 infections in the unlock phase and re-imposition of localised lockdowns in several states, appear to have interrupted this recovery,” said ICRA principal economist Aditi Nayar.

“Given the severity of the pandemic and the duration of the safety measures that need to be employed, we now expect a deeper pace of GDP contraction in Q2 FY21 relative to our earlier forecast. We also anticipate more unevenness, as different regions move in and out of lockdowns, and persisting labour supply mismatches affecting supply chains and consumption patterns,” said Nayar.

The rating agency has pushed its timeline for a firmer recovery out of the contractionary phase to Q4 FY21 from Q3 FY21. “This presumes that a vaccine will be widely available by then, which now appears necessary for discretionary consumption to recover in certain sectors such as travel, hospitality and recreation,” Nayar added.

On the positive side, ICRA expects the rural economy to partly counter the urban slowdown . ICRA remains optimistic regarding the outlook for agricultural growth and rural consumption given the favourable monsoon so far. “More than half of the 2019 kharif acreage has already been covered. ICRA thus, continues to expect agricultural gross value added to rise by 3.5-4.0% in FY21, supporting rural sentiment,” ICRA said in a statement.

The rating agency has, however, tempered its expectations regarding the extent of fiscal support that may be forthcoming, given the revenue shock being experienced by various levels of the government. “Overall, we have revised our forecast of the contraction in GDP in FY21 to 9.5% from our previous expectation of 5%”, Nayar added.

The data up to June 2020 provided some broadly encouraging cues of a gradual, yet uneven recovery across different sectors relative to the troughs experienced in April 2020. However, the re-imposition of lockdowns in some states has arrested this recovery. Data on electricity consumption signals a mild worsening in the pace of contraction to 4.9% for the week ending July 13, 2020 from 3.7% for the week ending July 6, 2020. Additionally, data on mobility sourced from Google indicates a plateau in the recent weeks.

ICRA expects the economy to have contracted by a sharp 25% in Q1 FY21. Given the aforesaid concerns, the ratings agency now expects a shallower recovery in the subsequent quarters, with a contraction of 12.4% in Q2 (previous exp.: -2.1%) and a milder 2.3% in Q3 (previous exp.: +2.1%), followed by an anaemic growth of 1.3% in Q4 FY21 (previous exp.: +5.0%).

There has been an “exponential rise” in the coronavirus cases in Patna over the past few days with 2,880 total cases recorded in the district so far.“While contact-tracing positive cases, we found that not taking precautions while on the road quadrupled the number of cases. For instance, Shastri Nagar, which is one of the worst-affected areas, has several vegetable and fruit markets. Residents throng the marketplaces without wearing masks,” said Patna DM Kumar Ravi, adding, cases started rising after Unlock 1.0 as people started moving about without safety precautions.According to Ravi, the New Capital Circle which houses several government departments has become a hotspot due to unavoidable reasons. “The nature of their jobs is also one of the reasons for the surge in cases here as government employees, doctors and cops cannot restrict themselves to their homes. In fact, a number of health workers at PMCH and NMCH have already been infected by the virus,” he said.Similarly, houses in Patna City are located cheek by jowl. “Most streets in Patna City have already been classified as containment zones in order to curb the spread of the virus,” Ravi said.Several methods such as rapid antigen testing and testing at portable booths are being given preference to increase testing in the city. “More than 500 people in the Patna division were tested using the rapid antigen testing kits on Thursday. The numbers will increase from tomorrow,” said divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal.According to health experts, rapid antigen testing may help in controlling the spread as they show results in 30 minutes. “As per findings from the Journal of American Medical Association, antibody testing, which is done by two methods, including rapid antibody test and ALISA test is quite significant and has a success rate of 100%,” said Dr Satyendra Narayan Singh, head of microbiology at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH).Meanwhile, many Patna residents claimed that they are facing hassles in getting bed at the hospitals.

The new guidelines require ARCs to invite bids from many potential buyers before selling assets, and also require ARCs to consult with investors before concluding a sale.In a circular to all ARCs, the RBI said that, to improve transparency in sale of secured assets, ARCs must rope in as many bidders as possible by soliciting public bids in an auction. Also, the ARCs have been asked to consult with investors in their security receipts while selling the assets. Third, the RBI has asked them to ensure that persons connected to the defaulting promoter do not buy the assets. Buying of auctioned assets by a promoter is barred under Section 29A of the Insolvency Act According to UV ARC director Hari Hara Mishra, while the move to enhance disclosure and transparency in ARC operations is welcome, implementation of a consultative process with security receipt holders in sale of assets may create an additional layer for decision-making and impact resolution timelines.ARCs buy bad loans from banks and make money by selling either the business or the assets. To fund the purchase of bad loans, which run into thousands of crores, they rope in investors who buy security receipts that are similar to units in a mutual fund. Investors get a share of the upside. In the case of ARCs, often the investors in the security receipts are banks.The RBI already has fair practices codes for lenders. On Friday, it issued a directive to all ARCs under Section 9 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002, asking them to adopt the fair practices code. This comes at a time when ARCs have been under fire for employing recovery agents using strong-arm tactics for recovering retail loans. Also, there have been cases where assets of large defaulters have been sold by ARCs in quiet one-to-one deals after purchasing the loan from banks.On the use of agents, the RBI has said that the ARCs should have a board-approved outsourcing policy in place. “In the matter of recovery of loans, ARCs shall not resort to harassment of the debtor. ARCs shall ensure that the staff are adequately trained to deal with customers in an appropriate manner,” the RBI said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77017002,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-97192,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-norms-may-slow-asset-sales-by-arcs/articleshow/77007604.cms

PATNA: The alleged rift between two constituents of ruling NDA – JD(U) and LJP – came to the fore once again on Thursday when LJP chief Chirag Paswan questioned the ‘zero corruption’ policy of the Nitish Kumar government by raising the issue of Sattarghat bridge.

Though reports said the newly inaugurated Sattarghat bridge at Gopalganj caved in on Wednesday, the state government clarified on Thursday that it was not the main bridge, but the approach road to an 18-metre small bridge that was washed away by floodwaters.

Chirag, however, went on to question the Nitish government on utilisation of public money for construction of the bridge. “Portion of a bridge constructed with an expenditure of Rs 264 crore has collapsed. Any work done with people’s money should be of highest quality. Such episodes raise a question in people’s mind about zero corruption. LJP demands a high-level inquiry into the matter and action against those responsible for it,” Chirag said in a statement.

The JD(U), however, took strong exception to Chirag’s statement. “Chirag is president of a ruling alliance. He should have cross-checked the fact before issuing such statements. Neither the main bridge, nor the small bridge but a part of the approach road was damaged due to very high current in the swollen Gandak,” JD(U) spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan Prasad said.

Road construction minister Nand Kishor Yadav, also a senior functionary of BJP , preferred not to comment. “Since there is not any issue at all, there is nothing to react on,” he told TOI.

It is not the first occasion when Chirag has criticised the Nitish government. During his ‘ Bihar First, Bihari First’ Yatra, which he had to abandon midway due to Covid-19 pandemic , Chirag had questioned the state government over various issues, including health facilities, law and order and lack of industries.

Meanwhile, leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav also slammed the state government over the bridge issue. “Nitish should seek resignation from road construction minister or initiate disciplinary action against him as he is a minister from BJP quota,” Tejashwi said.

DEHRADUN: Even though Dehradun is known as the school education hub of the country with a multitude of private educational institutions spread across the city, the students of government schools here have managed to perform better in the Class X and Class XII board examinations, the results of which were announced recently.

In the Class X examinations, the overall performance of Dehradun region, which includes entire Uttarakhand and eight districts of Uttar Pradesh, was slightly better than the previous year with a pass percentage of 89.72%. While the Kendriya Vidyalayas in the region recorded a pass percentage of 99.56%, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas saw 98.94%. The other government schools too recorded 94.89%. However, this is in contrast to the performance of private schools which could manage a pass percentage of only 89.09%.

In Class XII examinations too, the KVs recorded a pass percentage of 99.04% and JNVs 97.65%. However, private schools managed to touch only 82.77%.

When asked about the gap between the pass percentage in private and government schools, educational experts opined that the trend is because children at private schools are unable to effectively utilise the ample resources available at their disposal while their counterparts in government institutions have to make do with their limited facilities. The trend at renowned Eklavya Residential School , meant for tribal children from humble backgrounds, is a testimony to this. While all students have passed the board examinations at the institute, their performance has also been remarkable nationally.

Pushplata Rawat, state coordinator of the NGO ‘Room to Read’, said, “During my personal experience as an educationist, I have observed that the government schoolchildren are better exposed to other life aspects as well which help in their development and they are able to connect the dots much better which in turn help their performance in academics as well.”

“I believe that government schoolchildren perform well because they know that only marks can help them have a better future. Unlike private schoolchildren, they don’t have anything to fall upon,” said S Ganguli, chief education officer of Aditya Birla Group.

Ranber Singh, regional director of CBSE , said, “The performance of Dehradun region has improved this year. Like always, the KVs and JNVs have proved their excellent quality of education. Earlier, we used to have a bigger region up to Noida but now despite limited centres, we have performed well as compared to other bigger regions.”

CHANDIGARH: The special court of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against suspended and on-the-run SHO of Manimajra police station Jaswinder Kaur in a Rs 5 lakh graft case.

The matter will come up for hearing on July 20. If she is not arrested by the date, then she will be declared a proclaimed offender.

Public prosecutor for CBI KP Singh had moved an application, seeking non-bailable arrest warrants against Jaswinder. Allowing the application, CBI special judge Sushil Kumar Garg ordered, “In view of circumstances mentioned in the application, non-bailable warrant of arrest be issued against the accused Jaswinder Kaur returnable on July 20.”

In the application, the CBI stated that Jaswinder “deliberately and intentionally absconded” despite being asked twice to join the investigation. CBI said she created false evidence in DDR at Manimajra police station that she had returned from CBI office, Sector 30. It also stated how CCTV footage of June 21 of Manimajra police station substantiated the allegations of complainant Gurdeep Singh that the SHO took his signatures under pressure on a blank paper.

One of the constables, Sarbjit Singh, revealed in a statement before the judicial magistrate that the SHO told him to take Gurdeep’s sign on a blank paper and write compromise.

The SHO was booked along with an alleged conduit, Bhagwan Singh, under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and Section 7 and 7A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, on June 29 on charges of seeking Rs 5 lakh bribe from Gurdeep, a Manimajra resident. Gurdeep had told the CBI that he had already paid Rs 2 lakh to Jaswinder for not lodging a cheating case against him and was to pay Rs 3 lakh more.

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Thursday directed state food safety commissioner and food laboratory’s chief public analyst to inform it whether fruits ripen through ethylene gas are fit for human consumption and also to explain the difference between ethylene and ethephon.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing two pleas filed by ethylene sachet traders, who complained about police harassment hindering their business in Telangana. The bench reminded assistant solicitor general N Rajeswara Rao to obtain a counter from Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).

The food safety authorities and labs had already declared that ethylene sachets were safe because it uses natural hormones within fruit to act as catalyst to ripen the fruits and hence the central authorities had issued guidelines approving the use of ethylene as a safe ripener, the bench said. “Hence, we cannot say that ethylene is a prohibited item. But the report of the amicus curiae was confusing, who brought in ethephon into the picture. This led to some confusion,” the bench said.

A little study into the matter revealed that edharine was the nickname of ethephon, it said. The amicus curiae’s report said that ethephon was an insecticide and hence cannot be used to ripen fruits. Petitioners’ counsel Dharmesh Jaiswal said that ethephon sachets produce ethylene gas, which would ripen the fruits, and was also approved by labs and authorities. The bench sought counters from the authorities and posted the case to July 30.

96,['17/07/2020'],Ex-Delhi doctor running illegal surrogacy operation in Nepal: Agra police,"Representative image

AGRA: An illegal commercial surrogacy operation in which babies were sold to foreign nationals for Rs 10 lakh has now come to light. The operations are based in Nepal, with poor women from Bihar and UP engaged as surrogates, and the doctors who ran it have recently shifted base to Faridabad because of the lockdown. The doctor and his wife are on the run.

The prime accused, an IVF specialist from Karnataka , Dr Vishnu Kant, had left the Delhi hospital he worked at and left for Nepal after commercial surrogacy was declared illegal in India. This was in December 2018. Police said he and his wife, Ashmita, then started an illegal surrogacy operation at Siliguri in West Bengal .

“They had started hiring women from Bihar and UP, who came from economically underprivileged sections, for surrogacy. They’d send them to Siliguri, where the IVF procedure would be done. Once they gave birth, the babies would be taken to Nepal by agents and sold to foreign nationals. Nepal had banned commercial surrogacy a year ago,” additional superintendent of police (East) Pramod Kumar said. “But when Covid-19 came, they had to move base. So they moved the surrogates to Faridabad.”

On June 19, Fatehabad (Agra) Police had arrested Neelam, a mother of five, for being engaged in “illegal activities”. She had been living at Girdhwar Enclave in Faridabad and, allegedly, pushed poor women into surrogacy. “Her cut was Rs 50,000 per woman. She had got in touch with Kant and his wife though Anand Rahul Sarashwat, a resident of Harsh Vihar in southwest Delhi’s Jaitpur area,” a police officer said. Sarashwat is from Mathura and had been hired as a driver by Kant earlier.

Also arrested at the time was Ruby, a surrogate mother who had given birth in May. She was caught carrying a baby to Nepal via the Agra-Lucknow Expressway with others — Sarashwat and two drivers, Amit Kumar from Badarpur and Pradeep Kumar from Faridabad — who later turned out to be part of the illegal operations. This was also on June 19.

There was another woman, Meena, who would also act as an intermediary and persuade women to take up surrogacy and a doctor who had a parallel surrogacy operation. Neelam, police said, used to work with the latter but they stopped working together after disputes over money. “During interrogation, those arrested spoke of Ashmita, who they said ran a maternity clinic in Nepal. Foreign nationals would be handed these babies for Rs 10 lakh. For each delivery, the surrogate would be paid Rs 3.5 lakh, Neelam and others would get between Rs 50,000 and Rs 20,000, and the rest was for Kant and his wife to keep,” ASP Kumar said. Five babies were delivered by the surrogates at a private maternity clinic in Faridabad and while three girls were rescued, Kumar added, it is not known where the two baby boys are. “We suspect they were sold to foreign nationals in Nepal.”

The six have been arrested for trafficking and Kant and his wife have been identified as the prime accused. The couple lived at Parsvnath Aviation City in Noida’s Sector 93 but had sold off the flat recently. Police suspect Kant has fled to Bengaluru. “A former colleague of his, Dr Vishal, and an aide, Saurabh, said that Kant worked at a child hospital in Greater Kailash for nearly 13-15 years before the surrogacy ban. Dr Vishal has been asked to share whatever information he may have,” the officer added.

99,['17/07/2020'],Key witness &amp; wife of Dubey henchman may turn approver,"Kanpur: While slain gangster Vikas Dubey ’s wife Richa was let off after a five-hour interrogation, Manu — wife of an arrested henchman Sashikant Pandey — is suddenly holding centrestage in police investigations after the surfacing of back-to-back audio clips in which she was purportedly heard mobilizing menfolk to take sniper position on rooftops and conniving with the don and misleading cops. After two days of rigorous questioning in detention, Manu, a crucial eyewitness to the Bikru bloodbath, was released on Friday and sent home under heavy police protection. With Manu singing in custody, police sources told TOI, she may be made an approver in the case.

Manu confided to investigators that she and her husband were ready to provide details on the Bikru ambush. Police sources told TOI, their statements would be taken under Section 164 CrPC for recording confessions and statements by a magistrate during investigation.

After her 48-hour detention, Manu was sent back to her Chaubeypur home under heavy police cover on Friday. “Though, she did not make a formal request for protection, two constables have been deployed round-the-clock outside her house after analyzing her threat perception,” said a police official. This gives credence to the theory that she’s crucial to the probe and may turn approver, said sources.

“During preliminary interrogation, Manu revealed details on aides who reached the Dubey’s residence on the fateful night and sequence of events leading to the carnage and what happened next. Besides Manu, her mother-in-law was another witness. Manu’s statements will give police crucial leads to investigate and verify multiple murders on the night of July 3,” said a police official.

Manu’s husband Sashikant, who was arrested late Monday, had accused the gangster of orchestrating the ambush while talking to reporters. To a query by media persons on what happened on the fateful night, Sashikant had stated, “The shootout was executed at the behest of gangster Dubey.” He further shared details of other accused, including Vikas Dubey and 25 of his aides involved in killing of eight policemen. He also confessed that three policemen, including slain DSP Devendra Mishra and a sub-inspector were killed and dumped in his house — a fact shared by his wife Manu, in an audio clip that went viral on Tuesday afternoon.

He also went on to tell the media that Dubey had even threatened them, saying he will kill them all, if they did not open fire.” Firearms, including semi-automatic guns and 30 Springfield rifle were used in the carnage, he said. SP Rural Brijesh Kumar Srivastava told reporters, “If Manu or her husband Sashikant are made approver, we will serve them a notice for recording their statements.”

101,['17/07/2020'],Child-sex racket accused brought to Bhopal,"Pyare Mian, who was arrested in Srinagar the previous day, in Bhopal custody on Thursday.

BHOPAL: Newspaper owner Pyare Mian , who is accused of raping minor girls, was brought to Bhopal from Srinagar on Thursday.

The 68-year-old had fled there after cases under POCSO were registered against him in Bhopal on Sunday, and was caught on Tuesday evening. Around 50 of his relatives -- including his daughter -- protested outside the police control room, claiming he was being “framed for political reasons”. She claimed he had surrendered in Srinagar and not arrested.

ADG Upendra Jain dismissed these claims and wondered why Pyare was found in Srinagar, 1500km away. “He could have surrendered before Indore police or any other police unit. Why did he take three taxis to Mumbai and then two flights to reach Srinagar? It can be confirmed from Kashmir police that he was nabbed on input from Bhopal police and did not surrender,” he said.

Pyare was brought to Bhopal by a crime branch team in the afternoon after being taken on transit remand. After medical examination, he was to be produced in court but since the sessions bench at Bhopal operates from 11am to 2pm due to Covid-19 precautions, he will be produced before court on Friday.

Pyare’s daughter claimed that he had gone to Ratibad police station after the minor girls he is accused of sexually exploiting were found on the road in the wee hours of Sunday. “Why didn’t police arrest him then? He is 70 and has been operated for prostate cancer and has not done any of the things alleged by police,” she said, adding that Pyare got frightened when he found he was “framed"" and fled Bhopal.

ADG Jain rejected this claim and said Pyare wanted to escape to Rajasthan but police got wind of after which he changed his plan and turned back from Jhalawar . “He came back to Indore and travelled by road to Mumbai, switching three taxis. He then took a flight to Delhi and another to Srinagar. Bhopal police got information of this and caught him with help of J&K police. Immediately a team was sent to take him in custody. All their claims are false,” Jain said.

Police are investigating Pyare’s ‘Kashmir connection’, he said. Asked if Pyare wanted to flee to Pakistan, he said he couldn’t say anything at the moment as investigation is on. Pyare is being interrogated, he said.

NOIDA: The Noida unit of the Special Task Force (STF) arrested a close aide of 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Abu Salem and his sharpshooter Khan Mubarak from the Sector 20 police station area on Wednesday night.

The accused, 38-year-old Gajendra Singh , is a property dealer and an investor of Salem’s money in Delhi-NCR, police said. He has been sent to judicial custody.

Raj Kumar Mishra, additional superintendent of police, STF, said that they had received information about Singh’s operations in Noida. “We were tipped off that he would be visiting his home in Sector 20 D block, following which a raid was conducted around 9.30pm and the arrest was made,” he said.

Mishra said police had recovered a pistol from the house of Singh’s partner in the property dealing business, Sanjay Sharma, in Surajpur. An FIR has been filed against him under sections of the Arms Act.

Since 2014, Singh had been running an extortion racket for Salem and using his property business to mask his criminal activities, Mishra said. “He would get people to buy property through him and after taking payment, he would threaten them by using the names of Abu Salem and Khan Mubarak,” he said.

In 2014, Mishra said, Gajendra Singh took Rs 1.8 crore from a Delhi-based businessman, Mukesh Bhargav, on the pretext of selling a property. When he was asked to return the money, Singh plotted an attack on the businessman and arranged for shooters to fire at him in Sector 18. The businessman, who was in his car, escaped. The attack took place in May.

Earlier that year, police said, Mubarak had transferred Rs 10 lakh to Singh’s account, with which the latter bought a Fortuner car in Kanpur.

“Gajendra Singh met Abu Salem and Zafar Supari (Khan Mubarak’s brother) in 2014 through Salem’s brother Abu Jaish in a Mumbai court. He was asked to join Salem in his operations in NCR and was given a personal shooter, Harish Khan. The two men made a lot of money between 2014 and 2017 by extorting people using Salem’s name,” Mishra said. Police does not know the whereabouts of Harish Khan.

In 2017, Singh had allegedly sheltered Khan Mubarak in his Noida home right before the latter was arrested in Mirzapur district by the STF.

Police said they had recovered the details of various bank accounts that had been made with fake Aadhaar and PAN cards through which Singh had exchanged money with gangsters.

During interrogation, they said Singh confessed to extorting Rs 52 lakh from a Sector 20 resident, Vineet Chauhan. The STF showed three cases related cheating, criminal intimidation and attempt to murder, all lodged at the Sector 20 police station in 2017 and 2018, at the time of producing him in court.

Singh also told police that he is a distant relative of gangsters Sundar Bhati, who is from western UP, and Azad Bansal of Ghaziabad.

103,['17/07/2020'],"UT cuts grant, pushes MC in deep financial imbroglio","Chandigarh: The municipal corporation, which is already facing a financial crunch, received a major blow with the Chandigarh administration deducting around Rs 5 crore each month from its grant-in-aid (GIA) during the current financial quarter, which is July, August and September.

In the first quarter of the fiscal from April to June, the civic body had received around Rs 35 crore each month from the finance department of the UT administration as GIA.

As per records, MC’s monthly expenditure on salaries, wages, pension and other committed liabilities is around Rs 40 crore, which it has to fulfil at all cost. This deduction of grant will put the authority under extreme financial burden, as its own income resources have shrunk drastically due to the pandemic.

“We have received a communication regarding the cut in grant. We do not understand how we will run the civic body under the current financial circumstances. A meeting will be held soon for a discussion in this regard, but one thing is clear that we will definitely look for extra finances to meet our liabilities,” an officer said.

Sources in the civic body said due to Covid-19, MC’s income had reduced and generating revenue was a major challenge. During the preparation of the budget in February, the authority had reserved Rs 402 crore from their own revenue, but it has now been reduced to Rs 286 crore. Increase in the water tariff was one of the most crucial segments, which could not be notified so far due to the pandemic.

Expenditure management

“We have got the communication regarding the cut in the grant, so we will manage the expenditure in all sectors accordingly,” said KK Yadav, municipal corporation commissioner.

Box:

Work stopped

As all kinds of developmental works have already stopped, the engineering wing of the MC has also been issued directions to stop the road re-carpeting due to the arrival of monsoon. Since the MC had received a special grant of around Rs 65 crore in the shape of deposits, only road re-carpeting was going on and all other works had stopped.

106,['17/07/2020'],"HC: No desert, then why have camels in Telangana?","Picture for representational purppose only.

HYDERABAD: Seeking answers as to why as many as 71 camels are inhabiting in Telangana where there is no desert, the high court on Thursday questioned the state government, its transport and police authorities as to what are they doing at the highway checkposts when these desert animals are brought into the state in an unlawful manner.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy posed several questions to state’s special counsel A Sanjeev Kumar while hearing a PIL filed by Dr Shashikala Kopanati of Earth Quotient, an NGO, seeking directions to the illegal slaughtering of camels during ensuing Bakrid in particular and to discourage the illegal and inhuman transportation of camels from Rajasthan into Telangana in general.

Responding to a query from the bench, Sanjeev said that the authorities had seized eight camels from those who were smuggling them into the state and sent them back to Rajasthan. “Those that were already brought in were being monitored and we will not allow them to be slaughtered,” he said.

In some areas, some people are eking out a living by using these animals for taking children on joyrides, he said. “Rajasthan’s economy is dependent on camels but its numbers are dwindling due to illegal transportation. This is happening despite that state banning it,” the bench said. Brushing aside a suggestion that Muslims eat camel meat on Bakrid as part of their custom, the bench said there was no such custom in Islam . The bench posted the case to Friday for further hearing.

107,['17/07/2020'],HC moots panels to review cases of history-sheeters,"MADURAI: Observing that it is necessary to harmonize and iron out ambiguities in the police standing order (PSO) while exercising power to history-sheet, the Madras high court has issued a slew of directions to the police personnel, which includes a direction to the director general of police (DGP) to constitute a district-wise committee to review all cases of history-sheeters.

The court was hearing a batch of petitions filed by some people seeking to remove their names from the history-sheeter list.

Justice N Seshasayee observed that having spotted certain vagueness and internal inconsistencies in the choice of expressions which the PSO employ and the constant threat they pose to fundamental rights would ultimately lead to unnecessary and avoidable litigations before the court.

Being adorned with the duty of being a constitutional sentinel, the court has to balance between the right of an individual to his fundamental rights as against the interests of the society in maintaining law and order through effective preventive policing.

Citing that the court senses a duty to step in till legislative alternatives are found, the judge observed that police personnel may have to be provided with clear parameters for exercising their power to history-sheet.

The judge said that in all the cases where a person has to be treated as an habitual offender, or one addicted to crime, or a known deprecator of law without a case pending and when the police propose to history-sheet him, he should have been either notified as a habitual offender under the Tamil Nadu Habitual Offenders Act or should have been one against whom an order has been made under Section 110 of CrPC.

In all cases, a person can be history-sheeted only for two years as per PSO 748(1) and retaining a history-sheeter beyond that period is an exception and it must have an objective basis.

The judge said that there cannot be any retention under PSO 748 (2), unless a fresh case is registered subsequent to the case which necessitated the opening of the history-sheet or a history-sheeter is notified as an habitual offender.

“In cases which are registered in connection with a citizen participating in any peaceful protests, agitations or demonstrations or the like, history-sheet should not be opened unless an order is passed by the executive magistrate under sections 107 or 110 of CrPC,” the judge observed.

The judge directed the DGP to constitute the committee to examine all cases of history-sheeting on the basis of the above parameters within one year. The judge further directed the DGP to take necessary steps to automate the process of history-sheeting to make the whole exercise self-driven.

The judge further directed the DGP to submit a half-yearly progress/ compliance report with regard to the above directions. The judge directed to issue a circular to the police personnel in this regard.

SURAT: The city police commissioner on Thursday ordered two more inquiries against woman lok rakshak dal (LRD) constable, Sunita Yadav , who has shot to limelight since taking on state junior health minister Kishore alias Kumar Kanani’s son for defying curfew orders.

Yadav, who has unleashed an outburst on social media, now faces inquiry for making people do sit-ups on the road and for not accepting the notice seeking explanation for remaining absent from duty since July 9.

The feisty cop is already facing an inquiry into the entire July 8 run-in with Kanani’s son Prakash and his friends whom she had taken on for violating the curfew orders. The videos of the incident and her subsequent conversations with senior police officials had gone viral, making her an instant Twitter sensation.

“I have ordered two inquiries against her, one in a case of forcing people to do sit-ups on the road and second for not accepting the notice sent for absenteeism from duty,” police commissioner RB Brahmbhatt told TOI.

Yadav had allegedly made some people do sit-ups for violating social distancing in Matawadi locality of Varachha. Raju Godhani, a resident of Varachha , had also submitted an application earlier regarding her alleged high-handed behaviour. “After watching the video, I found that she is the same woman who harassed me and other people in Matawadi. I had complained about her and she was shifted to another location. But she continued with her abrasive behaviour,” Godhani alleged, while talking to TOI.

Also, Yadav had reportedly refused to accept the notice sent by police headquarters seeking explanation for not reporting to duty since July 9. She went on leave after the run-in with Kanani on the grounds that she was unwell. On July 14, when a police team went to serve her a notice, Yadav refused to accept it claiming she doesn’t know Gujarati. All three inquiries are being conducted by JK Pandya, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), F-division.

ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan said, “Mukhtar-backed fish trade mafia Ravindra Kumar Nishad’s properties worth Rs 3.71 crore had been seized by Jaunpur police on July 10. Police came to know about more immovable properties created by Nishad and seized one more house worth Rs 95 lakh and an SUV of Rs six lakhs in Jaunpur.”

Earlier, on July 10, a two-floor residential building, a shopping complex, two goods carriers and a motorcycle of Nishad, who was booked under Gangster Act following his arrest, had been confiscated while his two bank accounts with deposits of Rs 5,82,082 and Rs 9,62,886 were also seized.

110,['17/07/2020'],Delhi: Your neighbour can report you for wasting drinking water,"NEW DELHI: The next time you see someone wasting potable water , just click a photograph and send it to Delhi Jal Board ( DJB ) for taking penal action.Though Delhi is a water-deficient city with a 300 million gallons per day demand-supply gap, overflowing tanks and people washing vehicles and floors with piped water are a common sight across colonies. However, such reckless behaviour is now bound to cause a heavy burden on the violator’s pocket.Based on directions of National Green Tribunal (NGT), DJB on Wednesday issued orders for a crackdown on misuse of potable water. Inspection and challan teams would fine first-time violators Rs 2,000 and repeat offenders Rs 5,000 per day.A senior DJB official said that the engineering wing, revenue department and enforcement cell have been tasked with issuing challans for such violations. “The teams constituted at the zonal level comprise executive engineers, superintendent engineers, maintenance staff and enforcement cell. An intensive drive will be carried out soon. Zone-wise compliance reports will be submitted every Monday,” he added.The offences covered in the drive would include overflowing tanks, washing of vehicles, cleaning of porches, floors and houses, and wasteful use of piped water in gardens.Raghav Chadha, DJB vice-chairman, said, “People can inform us about such violations by taking photos and tagging us on the official Twitter handle @delhijalboard or by lodging a complaint on the helpline number 1916.”While the Delhi Water Policy lays clear emphasis on conservation and minimising inefficient use, the message doesn’t seem to have percolated to the city’s dwellers.Experts said low public consciousness about scarcity and economic value of water results in its wastage and inefficient use. Even enforcement by DJB has been somewhat lax. Between April 2019 and March 2020, no challans were issued for misuse of water. The intervention of NGT was required to bring about a change.“Ideally, people should mandatorily use overflow prevention valves or tank overflow alarms to stop water wastage. It is also their duty to fix leaks in pipes, taps and toilets. Water-efficient devices, faucets and aerators are also available in the market. We should avoid using drinking water wastefully in gardens and lawns. It is a penal offence to wash cars and floors with piped water,” the official said. He recommended that instead of throwing away the reject water from RO purifiers, it should be used in washing or cleaning floors.The huge demand-supply gap has also led to many people relying on illegal borewells, which further depletes the sub-soil reserves. So far, DJB has identified 20,351 illegal borewells of which 6,283 have been sealed. “We have limited water from Yamuna and underground aquifers. It is our collective duty to treat water as a limited resource of high value,” the official said.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77009895,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148772,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/your-neighbour-can-report-you-for-wasting-drinking-water/articleshow/77008751.cms

112,['17/07/2020'],CJ’s bench will hear Pilot campplea on defection notices today,"Jaipur: Sacked Rajasthan deputy CM Sachin Pilot and his band of 18 Congress MLAs on Thursday filed a petition in the HC, challenging the constitutional validity of “some provisions” in legislature rules invoked by the Speaker to issue them disqualification notices on grounds of defying the party whip and staying away from CLP meets on consecutive days.

Challenging Congress’s reliance on the (anti-defection) law, it argues it could have dangerous consequences such as an elected representative being deprived of membership at the “whims and fancies of the party leader”.

Two versions of the petition were heard during the day, first at 3pm and again at 5pm, before the single-judge bench of Justice Satish Kumar Sharma acceded to a plea to list the matter before a division bench.

Pilot’s lawyers — Harish Salve, Mukul Rohatgi and Devadutt Kamat — had sought time to amend the petition during the first hearing, saying the petitioners wanted to incorporate elements challenging the constitutional validity of portions of the Rajasthan Assembly Member (Disqualification on the grounds of changing party) Rules, 1989. The plea was accepted despite opposition from Congress counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi and advocate general MS Singhvi, representing the Speaker.

“The original petition had only challenged the notices issued by Speaker CP Joshi on the basis of a complaint filed by Congress against Pilot and his loyalists, accusing them of conspiring with BJP to topple the Ashok Gehlot government,” said Prateek Kasliwal, one of the lawyers representing the Speaker. The division bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta will take up the amended joint petition on Friday.

According to the petition, which lists Pilot as petitioner No. 7, all 19 MLAs who have been served notices by the Speaker are still with Congress and none of them has given up assembly membership. The petition mentions that Pilot had already issued multiple statements saying he had no intention of leaving Congress.

The MLAs’ petition argues that the Speaker should have given them at least a week’s time to respond to the allegations against them instead of just two days (till 3pm on July 17). “Grave mischief is sought to be achieved by the prejudicial manner in which the CLP is seeking to impose sanctions upon the MLAs on sheer presumptuous basis, as the complaint (by Congress chief whip) is dated July 14 and the showcause notice is issued (by the speaker) on the same day,” the petition states.

The MLAs accused Gehlot of trying to threaten them through an inquiry by the Special Operations Group (SOG) so that they wouldn’t raise their voices against “the inefficiency of leadership within the party”.

On being taken to task for not attending CLP meetings, the Pilot camp has said that skipping party conclaves cannot be considered tantamount to inviting disqualification on grounds of defection.

Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi reached the court with an impleadment application, saying he should be made party to the case as the Speaker had issued notices based on his petition filed under para 2(1)A of Schedule X of the Constitution.

113,['17/07/2020'],Law to protect consumers kicks in from next week,"NEW DELHI: From Monday, consumers can file complaints at district or state consumer commissions linked to the place where he stays or works rather than from where he bought any product or service. The government has notified most provisions of the Consumer Protection Act , which will come into force from Monday.

The provisions include consumers’ right to file cases against manufacturers, sellers or distributors of adulterated and spurious products in regular courts while they can file complaints in consumer commissions to seek compensation. The Act has set the quantum of punishment that a normal court can award, which is up to six months jail and fine of up to Rs 1 lakh even if such products do not result in any injury to the consumer. The punishment can be seven years jail and Rs 5 lakh fine in case there is grievous injury to the consumer. If it results in death, the offender can face at least seven years in jail, which may extend to life imprisonment, and with fine not less than Rs 10 lakh.

Consumer affairs secretary Leena Nandan told TOI that the provision with regard to functioning of Central Consumer Protection Authority and e-commerce will be notified in the next one or two weeks. While the consumer commissions at district, state and national level can entertain complaints from one individual or a group, the CCPA will have the power to take up cases for investigation suo motu and also forward cases for class action suit to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission where a large number of consumer are adversely impacted.

The CCPA will also have power to deal with misleading advertisements, including by celebrity endorsers. It will also have authority to order recall of faulty products, seize such items and even order refund to consumers. “The enforcement of the Act will be expedited by notifying the remaining provisions and rules,” the consumer affairs secretary said.

Sources said the CCPA will work in close coordination with the National Consumer Helpline Number, an agency engaged by the ministry to receive and resolve consumer complaints. “The consumer helpline, which receives about 50,000 complaints every month, will share the analysis such as frequent complaints against particular firm or against a product, delay in refund consumers. The CCPA can then take action. Largely, the CCPA will deal with grievances of a class of consumer. Individual complaints can be filed in consumer commissions,” said a source.

Though the government has notified the provision for electronic filing of complaints in the consumer commissions, the exact date to implement this will be notified by the president of ( NCDRC ).

The law has also introduced setting up of mediation cells in every commission for mutual settlement of complaints. However, these won’t entertain matters relating to proceedings in respect of medical negligence resulting in grievous injury or death and matters which relate to defaults or offences for which applications for compounding of offences have been made by one or more parties. Cases involving serious and specific allegations of fraud, fabrication of documents, forgery, impersonation, coercion won’t be taken up by these cells.

CJM T V Hemanandakumar remanded inspector Sridhar, sub-inspectors Raghu Ganesh and Balakrishnan, head constable Murugan and constable Muthuraj in judicial custody for 15 days. They were lodged in the Madurai Central Prison.

NAGPUR: The audio-clip issue took a twist as Ashish Rathod, alias Maddy, a murder convict on parole, on Thursday landed at the crime branch admitting his involvement in the ‘honeytrapping’ audio clip to implicate two senior politicians. He also claimed to have leaked the clip to police through his network to serve a ‘social cause’.

Crime branch, now probing the case, are now contemplating whether to convert the complaint filed by BJP corporator Dayashankar Tiwari into either a FIR or Non-Cognizable Offence. The complaint was filed before the Tehsil police station where Tiwari also recorded his statement.

City police chief BK Upadhyay had transferred Tiwari’s complaint to crime branch to probe his allegations against the alleged persons conspiring to honeytrap him and another person in order to shield a senior health official who is also close to a top civic body officer. “We are now exploring various legal possibilities regarding the clip,” said CP.

Tiwari said his entire family, including 99-year-old mother, along with followers were left stunned after the audio-clip leak indicating there was a conspiracy being hatched to trap him for raising voice against malpractices in the civic body. “Police must bring the offenders to book,” he said.

DCP, crime, Gajanan Rajmane said the audio-clip had been already substantiated by one of the persons (Rathod) in the conversation. “We will also send the clip for a formal forensic verification,” he said. “We have already collected the voice sample of Rathod which too would be sent,” he said.

It is learnt Rathod has stated Sahil Sayyed, also named in two offences, wanted to close down the hospital which would mean inconvenience to many and workers losing their employment which motivated him to share the clip with police to alert everyone regarding the honeytrap.

126,['17/07/2020'],Skewed development on forest land drives leopards into Jaipur parks,"TimesView Jaipur's growth as a city, encroachments and development projects have severely reduced the habitat of leopards in the Jhalana Forest Reserve over the last decade. Public parks designed by development authorities on forest land too have compounded the issue. With increasing number of leopards and the consequent demand for more space, authorities have to find solutions to ensure a habitat for these wild animals. A cell consisting of forest officials and related departments of civic bodies can make better plans for the use of forest land that is both sensitive to the needs of wildlife as well as of tourists.

JAIPUR: The encroachment of forest land for urban expansion and development is showing its adverse effect now, as many leopards have started taking refuge in city parks, which were once their home.Experts believe, the development authorities in the past have spent crores to provide various facilities to residents, without considering that it was disturbing the natural habitat of wild animals.As the leopard population at Jhalana Forest Reserve is steadily increasing, the leopards are straying out in search of new territories. However, over time, it has been encroached by private developers and civic bodies.Environment conservationist Joy Gardner said, “Jhalana reserve forest has no buffer area. A male leopard requires at least 5-sqkm area. At present, there are 10–12 total leopards in Galta Valley close to Silvian Park . Since the land was home for wildlife, the forest and development authorities should earmark it for leopards and only open the park for public.”Others believe, the situation arose due to lack of coordination between the two departments. “The forest department should have explained to JDA the reasons why these areas should not be developed. Also, the nature of work which was undertaken, along with the construction, is a non-forestry activity. Moreover, mandatory approvals under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 were not obtained,” said a forest source.In the last two months, several incidents have been witnessed in Jaipur where leopards have entered human settlements putting forest officials in a spot.Officials claimed that increasing population of leopards has resulted in shortage of space at the Jhalana forest area in Jaipur. This has forced the big cats to venture out of the forest and stray into human settlements to look for new territories. As per the Waterhole Census, there has been an increase in leopards in the Jhalana forest area. At present, there are 28 leopards excluding cubs, despite at least five dying due to various reasons in a year.A forest official said, “There are five to seven sub-adults at the park. Leopards venturing out are sub-adults. The area of Jhalana is 23 square metre and the big cat population is higher than its carrying capacity. The problem will increase, if proper planning is not chalked out.” “In many regions of Jhalana and Galta, human activities such as illegal construction and mining are still rampant. The forest department and JDA have turned a blind eye to both the issues,” said a regular visitor of Jhalana park, who wished not to be named.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77009892,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-757293,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/skewed-devpt-on-forest-land-drives-leopards-into-city-parks/articleshow/77008778.cms

After all the public is also waiting and it doesn’t help if they have to run from pillar to post. Shorten the timeline for accreditation, make sure NADL doesn’t drag its feet,” a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad remarked, while hearing a plea on ramping up testing facilities in the city.“Considering the fact that as on July 15, there are a total of 1,16,993 Covid cases in Delhi, of which 17,807 are active, in our opinion the window of one month given by ICMR for applicants to complete the procedural formalities is too long,” the bench noted, while saying that NABL must “hasten the inspection” so that applicants can complete the formalities required by ICMR at the earliest.The high court’s direction came after ICMR said it has been granting approvals to private hospitals and labs to conduct the rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests, where it gives them one month’s time to apply for the same after getting accreditation by NABL.During the hearing, the court also granted time till July 27 to National Centre of Disease Control (NCDC) to place before it its preliminary report of the “sero survey” carried out in the capital to assess prevalence of Covid-19 infection at the community level.It had earlier sought to know from these agencies how many labs and private hospitals in the capital had been allowed to conduct rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests, as well as the status of the sero survey carried out in the city.TOI had reported that in an affidavit before the high court, while seeking a minimum of one week to make its findings public, NCDC had said the study was done “to assess the prevalence of infection at the community level and is primarily used for evidence-based public health response.”Claiming that the exercise had to be done methodically and was a “time consuming” process, NCDC argued that imposing timelines for declaration of result for these studies “will lead to a compromise in the quality of the analysis and can have a detrimental impact on the evidence-based results.”During the hearing conducted via videoconferencing, the high court was informed by Delhi government counsel, Satyakam, that from June 18 to July 15, a total of 2,81,555 rapid antigen detection tests had been carried out, of which 19,480 had tested positive for Covid-19. Of the remaining 2,62,075 who tested negative, there were 1,365 who were still showing symptoms and were subjected to RT-PCR tests, where 243 were found to be Covid positive.The bench then sought to know why there was such a variation in the figures of testing done through RT-PCR and RAT method.Satyakam explained that as per ICMR norms, once a person was tested through RAT mode and was found to be positive, he/she was taken to be a Covid patient and no further follow up test through RT-PCR was required to be conducted. It was only in cases where a patient was found symptomatic but his results were negative in the RAT test, were they required to undergo the RT-PCR gold standard test.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77012025,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-36154,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/put-approvals-for-covid-tests-on-fast-track-says-hc/articleshow/77008808.cms

He said that completing homework every day and continuous revision gave me an edge in examination. “I followed my teachers in school and completed my syllabus before my pre-boards. After that, I solved five previous year’s question papers to understand the examination pattern. I was scared of science, so I made extra efforts to become better in the subject,” said Yash.

His total out of five subjects was 484 marks where he scored 100 in mathematics, 95 in science and social science, 98 in Hindi and 96 in English.

Yash’ grandfather, Ramkishan, is a retired government employee who helps out his parents financially.

Ramkishan explained, “He has always been a bright student. I support any other help needed for my grandchild. Yash, wants to pursue engineering and I am confident he will get through it.”

Yash’s family couldn’t afford expensive coaching fee in Kota . Therefore, they have decided to keep him in Bharatpur.

The order, issued by ACS (home) Rohit Kumar Singh stated, “During a high-level review meeting of the emerging situation in respect of the spread of the virus, it was noted that the recent spike in cases in many districts is largely attributable to non-compliance of various orders issued by the government from time to time…”

“…Unregulated movement of persons across inter-state borders, non-compliance of provisions pertaining to social distancing and wearing of masks in public and work places,” the order stated.

The department instructed all persons in-charge of work places/ofﬁces to ensure that employees wear masks compulsorily and maintain adequate social distance at work places, at all public places and transport. Non-observance of this shall be punishable with ﬁne, the department added.

“Shops owners shall ensure social distancing among employees, customers and all others. They shall also ensure that no crowding takes place, under any circumstances, on their premises,” it stated.

“Frequent sanitization of entire work place, common facilities and of all the points which frequently come into human contact - like door knobs, handles, railings etc. - shall be ensured at all times.

132,['17/07/2020'],"Rajasthan: Wedding sans rituals, guests get tea, biscuits","The bride and groom hold a book of teachings of their Guru after the wedding in Pratapgarh

UDAIPUR: When one talks of Indian weddings, elaborate revelries like mehendi, haldi, sangeet and a lavish buffet come immediately to mind. However, in Pratapgarh, a couple decided to get married sans rituals and follow austerity in the celebrations.

The groom was dressed in a casual pant-shirt, while the bride didn’t have any jewellery on her and neither were her palms adorned by mehendi. Some 25 guests including relatives and close family members from both the sides sat on the ground while ‘KabirVani’ was played and within 17 minutes, the wedding was solemnised. The couple wanted to break away from these rituals to create awareness among people against superstition.

Rekha, the bride, daughter of Kamalchandra from Chatarpura village in Arnod tehsil of Pratapgarh, married Perulal, son of Ramchandra from Amaliyapada Beed of Ratlam district in Madhya Pradesh.

There was no reception and the guests were served tea and biscuits only. No pheras or varmala rituals were performed.

“The disciples of Kabirpanthi Sant Rampalji Maharaj and members of the Labana Samaj are doing away with the rituals and social evils related to weddings such as dowry, squandering money lavishly on gifts and receptions etc,” spokesman Sohan Panwar said.

Such simple weddings are known as ‘Ramaini’ among them, where not even invitation cards are printed.

However, he denied his presence at the gangster’s village or house during the police raid .

“During questioning, he has made revelations wherein he was found to be involved in aiding gangster Vikas after ambush on July 2 & 3 night. He, however, had denied his presence at Bikru village. We are in the process of accessing call detail report of Guddan Trivedi and his driver Sushil Kumar Tiwari alias Sonu to cross-check and match their location on the fateful night, when the gangster and his aides killed eight policemen after opening indiscriminate firing on them,” said Inspector Nazirabad Gyan Singh.

They were produced before court and sent to jail on Wednesday.

To recall, the district police had initially denied that encountered gangster Vikas aide Guddan is a wanted accused, but soon after his arrest from Thane area of Maharashtra, the police had made a U-turn and informed Thane court that he is a wanted accused in the Chaubeypur encounter case in which eight policemen were shot dead by Vikas and his accomplices.

Inspector Gyan Singh had thereafter stated that a case had been registered against Vikas, 21 named accused and 60 to 70 unnamed accused on July 3 at the Chaubeypur police station. He had then added that Guddan, who was arrested from Thane Maharashtra, is wanted in this case.

MUMBAI: Suspended police officer Sachin Vaze , facing trial in the case of custodial death of 2002 blast accused Khwaja Yunus , was reinstated due to “overwhelming scenario’’ because of Covid and needing more policemen on duty. Joint commissioner (administration) Nawal Bajaj, in an affidavit, said Vaze was suspended (2004-20) and “during pendency of criminal case, it was decided not to initiate departmental enquiry’’.

At the quarterly meeting to review suspended policemen on June 5, the review committee headed by police commissioner considered cases of officers including Vaze and three other constables. The CP considered the “large-scale infection’’ of Covid among policemen as a vital issue.

In October 2011, the state decided to have the committee take a decision on suspension if the case is pending for two years after filing a chargesheet.

Asiya Begum (72), mother of Yunus, filed a contempt petition against Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh in HC. The matter will come up for hearing on Friday.

138,['17/07/2020'],Wife of gangster’s aide heard mobilising men to take sniper position on rooftops,"File pic of Vikas Dubey’s house when it was not razed

Kanpur: The serial tape exposes on the midnight ambush in Bikru village has again unearthed the role of women folk in destroying evidence, peddling don Dubey’s messages and misleading cops after the carnage. On Thursday, a fresh audio clip surfaced in which a woman can be heard asking her father-in-law Prem Prakash Pandey to quickly reach home and take sniper position on rooftops. The voice in the 33-second audio clip is said to be that of Manu, wife of Vikas’ aide Sashikant Pandey, who was arrested on Tuesday. Manu was taken into custody on Wednesday following the surfacing of back-to-back audio clips in which she was found conniving with the gangster and his aides.

TOI, however, cannot verify the authenticity of the clips though Manu admitted to reporters on Wednesday that it was her voice in the two earlier clips that went viral.

In the first call recording, Manu is heard enquiring about her father-in-law Prem Prakash Pandey’s location. When informed that he’s in neighbouring Dibba Newada village, she requests him to rush home as Vikas Dubey had ordered menfolk to climb atop houses and take position with rifles due to an impending police raid.

In another 22-second audio tape, Pandey can be heard conveying the don’s directives to his son, Sashikant. He’s heard asking Sashikant to immediately contact him on his mobile. Police said, the conversation seems to be just hours before the ambush, in which eight policemen including DSP Devendra Mishra were killed.

Speaking to TOI, a police officer said, investigations revealed DSP Devendra Mishra had taken refuge in courtyard of Manu’s house to skirt the barrage of bullets from rooftops, but was killed after Manu apprised the gangster’s henchmen about the police officer’s location.

In the first viral audio on July 14, Manu could be heard admitting Dubey’s men had killed policemen and dumped three bodies near her door. She’s also heard discussing ways to dispose her mobile phones and mislead cops. “Two men died at my door, while another man died in my courtyard. Everyone has ran away, what will I say when police arrive,” she is heard telling her ‘bhabi’. Similarly, in another audio, a call recording between Manu and her brother went viral on Wednesday. In the conversation, Manu is heard telling her brother about destroying a SIM card and is repeatedly told to delete call details from his phone as well.

Manu’s father-in-law Prem Prakash Pandey was gunned down by police in an encounter, six hours after the Bikru ambush, while her husband, Sashikant was arrested on Tuesday.

Mobile phone of wives and women members of all 11 on-the-run accused have been seized by police. “Going by conversations in audio clips, there is ample evidence against Manu and we are questioning and corroborating her role in the Bikru ambush. We are going through call detail record of their cell phones to establish their links with slain gangster Vikas Dubey,” said SP rural Brijesh Kumar Srivastava while talking to reporters. Police had deferred the decision to free slain Dubey aide, Amar’s wife Khushi, who is currently in prison.

Bhadohi SP Ram Badan said they were stopped and asked to return as the prohibitory orders are in place. The police took them to Sitamarhi guest house.

Later, in his support many party leaders including former MLA Ajay Rai moved to Bhadohi. They staged sit-in in Sitamadhi area when stopped by police. Heavy police force was deployed in the area to avert any untoward situation.

Lallu said that he was going to pay respect to the victims of the Umbha massacre, in which several people were killed. Criticizing the state government, he said that the police force should be utilized in catching criminals instead of stopping him. The Congress would continue to raise its voice for the people’s right.

As many as 10 persons of Gond tribe were killed and several others were injured at Umbha village in firing by the gram pradhan and him men when they opposed the land grabbing on July 17 last year.

Last year, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was also stopped when she was going to meet the kin of those killed in the firing.

CHANDIGARH: The engineering department of the UT administration has received bids of Rs 10 crore to re-carpet 10km section of the Delhi-Chandigarh national highway falling in the city. The department has started technical evaluation and work will be allotted after the monsoon.

Sources said before sanctioning the project, a team of engineering officials of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) visited the city to know the situation. Later, they held a detailed discussion with officials of the engineering department and gave their nod to the project.

“Since NHAI officials are actively involved in the exercise, the engineering department has been in consultation with them. They are now involved in the technical evaluation of the bidding. After completion of the evaluation, financial bidding will be opened, and tender allotted as per laid down norms and guidelines,” said a senior officer of the UT.

Sources said the re-carpeting is being done after completion of the specified period. “Though the national highway can be re-carpeted after a gap of three years, we gave proper time and are re-carpeting the road after five years. All technical and related parameters are being followed so that the road can be re-carpeted properly,” an official said.

The finance department has imposed a 20% cut on works due to the Covid-19 crisis and only necessary works are being done. But since the work of re-carpeting the road is being financially aided by the NHAI, there is no issue of funds.

Different stretches

The re-carpeting work will be done on 10km NHAI road in Chandigarh under the project. According to the UT engineering department, the stretches are from Sector 39 to Sector 43 near the ISBT roundabout and from there to the Sector 34-35 roundabout. The stretch from Sector 34-35 roundabout till the GMCH roundabout and from Hallomajra roundabout till the Chandigarh boundary too will be re-carpeted.

BHOPAL: BJP veteran Ramdayal Prabhakar – a two-term MLA– resigned from the party on Thursday, alleging ‘dictatorship’ in the state BJP unit and ‘insult of the old guard’.

Prabhakar is from Datia, the home district of cabinet minister Narottam Mishra. Sixteen of the impending bypolls are in Gwalior-Chambal region, where Prabhakar’s former constituency, Sewda, lies.

It’s yet another sign that resentment is brewing In Madhya Pradesh BJP after the recent cabinet expansion and allocation of portfolios in which Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalists walked away with the lion’s share. “I am a two-term MLA from Sewda assembly seat in Datia. I won in 1993 and 2003 but now I feel neglected in the party. After Sewda was declared a general seat in delimitation in 2008, the party has not given me any responsibility,” Prabhakar told TOI on Thursday.

In his resignation letter to BJP state chief V D Sharma, Prabhakar writes: “I have resigned from primary membership of the party and from all positions, including Datia district general secretary, state working committee, and SC Front. The party’s old workers are being ignored and insulted. There is dictatorship in the party. Issues related to public interest and welfare are considered as opposition of the party.”

Asked if he had spoken to any senior leader or received any call from the party leadership, Prabhakar said ‘no’. He said he has no grudges against any leader who has joined the party recently and been given a plum post. “But there are some senior leaders who are neglecting workers and dedicated leaders,” he added.

The appointment of two former Congress leaders — Pradyumna Singh Lodhi and Pradeep Jaiswal — as chairpersons of two corporations soon after they switched to BJP seems to have added to the simmering resentment after Team Scindia cornered 41% cabinet berths and largely had its say in allocation of portfolios.

Former minister Ajay Vishnoi had taken a dig at the largesse to Lodhi and Jaiswal, tweeting on Monday: “A wonderful example of ‘give and take’ policy… Where do you want to take BJP?”

BJP, however, denies there are any rumblings within the party and said anyone can approach the leadership to discuss their grievances. “There is no resentment in the party. We have not received any letter. On receiving the letter, the party leadership will take appropriate action,” said BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal.

Rajkot: Two villages near Rajula of Amreli district — Nani Mandaradi and Moti Mandaradi — have been cut off from each other after the only bridge over River Dhatarvadi that links them has collapsed.

The bridge on the National Highway 8E connects nearly 2,000 people of the two villages.

“A part of the dilapidated bridge as well as a diversion at one end have collapsed. It is on the verge of total collapse any day and we will have no option but to wade through knee-deep and waist-deep water to cross the river,” a resident of Nani Mandaradi, Ramesh Patel, lamented.

“While both the villages share a common village panchayat, the panchayat office is one village, but the fair price shop is on the other side. This leads nearly 2,000 villagers to cross the river on foot, sometimes even having to drag their two-wheelers through water, risking their lives in the flood waters,” said Patel.

Apart from Nani Mandaradi and Moti Mandaradi villages, the broken bridge has also left Jhapoder village in the lurch.

Jhapoder village sarpanch, Manu Dhakada said, “Rajula is just two kilometres away from Jhapoder, and so we would use the bridge to reach there quickly. But now, in the absence of the bridge, our villagers have to take a 25km-long detour in order to reach Rajula.”

After people from these three villages made a representation to Amrish Der, the local MLA, he visited the site and apprised officials concerned in Gandhinagar about the villagers’ plight and sought remedial measures.

GREATER NOIDA: Two men were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly building and selling flats in Shahberi village that were deemed unfit for people to live in.

The accused, Hirendra Kant Sharma and Ashok Goswami, both from Ghaziabad , were picked up from their houses. Police said they had been on the run since last year.

As per the complaint filed by officials of the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority , the accused have duped hundreds of people into investing in illegal properties at Shahberi. Separate cases were registered against them under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings), 420 (cheating) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using forged as genuine) of the IPC.

Harish Chander, DCP (central Noida) said: “They constructed illegal buildings with substandard material after getting the floor maps approved by the development authority and later, they sold the flats.

JAIPUR: Vaibhav Maheshwari, son of a flour shopowner from Pali, scored 97% in CBSE Class X board examinations on Wednesday. He studies at Ambuja Public School, Rabariyawas, Pali.

His family is well known as the ‘chakkiwale’ as his father is the third generation running the 60-year-old shop. “I have worked hard to provide everything to my family. While helping out in the shop, my son has studied religiously for the exams and took his studies seriously. All my prayers have come true,” said Mahendra Maheswari , Vaibhav’s father.

Explaining about his preparation, Vaibhav said it was just about consistency during preparation. He explained, “I completed my syllabus by January and in pre-boards I performed well. Consistency is important and there are times when I thought that I won’t be able to perform well, but I had to overcome my fear and the result is in front of everyone.”

He scored 98 in Hindi, mathematics and IP, 97 in social science and English and 94 in science. His total score was 582 out of 600.

Vaibhav said his father never let him feel about any of the financial problems he might be facing and his education was always a priority. “I want to be an engineer and will be sitting for IIT exam after class XII. Next year, I will give scholarship exams in Kota coaching institutes as I know it won’t be possible for my family to pay hefty fees. I am hopeful to get scholarship,” said Vaibhav.

His father confidently said Vaibhav will clear IIT exam and will become first engineer in the family.

JAIPUR: To facilitate expatriates who want to return to Rajasthan from various countries on Vande Bharat flights , the state government has written to the Centre to extend these flights to Jodhpur and Udaipur and set up customs and immigration facilities .

These passengers, rather than landing in Jaipur and staying in 14-day quarantine, can directly visit their home cities when these flights are extended up to Jodhpur and Udaipur. Additional chief secretary Subodh Agarwal, head coordination, migration (air) has written to the Centre and asked them to set up customs and immigration facilities at Jodhpur and Udaipur airports to facilitate extension of Vande Bharat flights to these cities.

Presently, these flights land in Jaipur and passengers are sent to paid institutional quarantine to various city hotels. “I have written to the Union home secretary urging him to direct departments such as customs, immigration and civil aviation to issue requisite clearances and permissions along with operations of non-scheduled and chartered flights to Udaipur and Jodhpur,” said Agarwal.

Various international organisations too on their own have requested the Centre to do the needful in this regard. Prem Bhandari, a social worker in New York, who was instrumental in getting the Vande Bharat flights started during lockdown said, “A person returning home with family is already in trouble. First, you will keep him in Jaipur in 14-day quarantine and thereafter, he would take any means of transportation to reach cities like Jodhpur, Barmer, Jaisalmer, Udaipur, Banswara and others. Thus, there is a need to extend these flights to Jodhpur and Udaipur.”

In the first phase of Vande Bharat, at least 3,000 Rajasthanis stuck in various countries including United Kingdom were brought back. Likewise, in the second phase, nearly 1,000 Rajasthanis have been brought back.

JAIPUR: Passengers travelling in trains are likely to get connectivity to more destinations, including Mysuru, Secunderabad and some parts of Punjab and Madhya Pradesh .

The North Western Railway (NWR) is awaiting nod of the railway board to get new set of special trains to various destinations. Though trains to various destinations from Rajasthan are witnessing low occupancy, officials are aiming at adding sectors where there is presently no rail connectivity. “Even if there is a poor load factor in some of the areas, we need to start for the places where we have no train connectivity. Whatever we are aiming is based on the suggestions by various MPs and others and on the basis of survey,” said a senior officer of NWR.

NWR has already written to the railway board and is awaiting their final nod on this. However, it is yet to be seen that while trains are having poor occupancy, will they go ahead with adding more trains.

“There is zero connectivity from Rajasthan to south India and some parts of Punjab and Madhya Pradesh. Gradually, they have to extend the train movement. So, it is better they start doing it in a phased manner,” said Trilok Singh, a private agent who books railway tickets. According to sources, there is possibility that Jaipur may get a connectivity to cities like Chennai, Mysuru, Ernakulam and Secunderabad.

“Also, these trains can run on weekly or bi-weekly basis as in Rajasthan there is a sizable population of the people from south India,” said a senior officer of NWR. It may be recalled that from June 1, NWR had started the movement special trains, while 10 trains to important destinations including Mumbai, Delhi and Ahmedabad were started.

The department has rolled out a 15-day special training schedule to provide them exposure to works like wildlife monitoring, conservation of natural habitat, prevention of illegal grazing and deforestation activities.

The training will be held at the tiger reserve areas to provide a better learning experience to the staff. “All forest department officials are provided training at the time of their recruitment, however, many of these get posted in forest areas without wildlife. Such officials are faced with challenges when transferred or deputed on duties at wildlife reserves.

The training programme will help the department in capacity building by upgrading the skills of the existing staff. It is expected to help in preventing incidences of human-animal conflicts and increasing wildlife population by conserving their natural habitat.

He also warned of action against violators of home quarantine.

While new cases are on the rise in the city, the collector said that the number surfaced from new areas. “Three to four cases are cropping up in new areas. If they accumulate in new areas, the spread will be fast,” he said.

On the source of infection, the collector dismissed the chances of community transmission. “As of now, 8 to 10% of the people being tested turn positive. If it touches 18 to 20%, we may suspect that scenario,” Sivarasu said.

He also said that stickers mentioning ‘the result is awaited’ on the houses of those awaiting Covid-19 test results, were being pasted. “We are planning to book those violate the rules. FIR will be filed against them,” he said adding that the movement of people in urban areas was a cause of concern.

On the likely emergence of clusters, the collector said that results of tests done on identified people in the ward with the highest number of cases will give an idea whether a cluster has been formed.

“Out of 14 clusters, we have contained four areas. There is no new case reported in the last three days. We can bring down the cases by preventing the formation of clusters,” he said.

A total of 245 people with symptoms of fever , severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), influenza-like illness (ILI) have been identified during door-to-door screening on Wednesday.

“We have selected areas where the numbers are high. Ward 16 has the highest number of cases. The tests on those identified with symptoms will be taken,” the collector said.

The collector also said that the district administration has hired six lab technicians and 30 nurses on a contract basis few days back, besides domestic breeding checkers (DBCs).

On the possibility of reducing the working hours of commercial establishments, Sivarasu said, “Traders are affiliated to several groups and they differ with their stand on the timings of the shops. If they follow the rules to wear masks and social distancing norms, it will reduce the spread.”

This is not a one-off case, but a common occurrence when it comes to police personnel who have been working in long shifts since the pandemic hit the state.As the country came to a standstill with the imposition of the lockdown on March 22, it was the responsibility of state police to keep the streets deserted to curb the spread of virus despite risking their own well-being. Majority of the cops in the state haven’t seen their families for over two months and even now, most of them see them only through video calls. The fortunate ones who met their families claimed that they cherished the few hours when they were off duty.“As soon as we came to know that a lockdown was going to be imposed, we decided to send our daughter to my mother in our village near Chomu. It has been one of the toughest days of our lives and at times we are close to tears as we could not see our child except on video calls. Since both of us are working, we just could not take the risk,” said Parvesh, who was a drone operator for nearly two months and is now stationed at the control room. His wife is posted at another police station in the city. There are approximately 1 lakh police personnel who have been working non-stop during the lockdown across the state to ensure that people adhere to the guidelines. While most have been coping, in the past three months at least five police personnel committed suicide in Rajasthan due to various reasons. During the lockdown months, police have worked for 12-hour or longer shifts.DGP Bhupendra Singh told TOI, “Each cop is trained to cope with adverse circumstances, but at the same time we have initiated several programmes to ensure that their mental health is not affected. There are difficulties and at times it is almost corrosive because we deal with so many tough situations, but we continue doing our duty.” Almost all police personnel that TOI spoke to claimed that as soon as lockdown was implemented they sent their families away to make sure they were safe.ASP Dausa Anil Chauhan, whose family stays in Jaipur said, “Since March, I have met my family only twice and both the visits were not for more than 24 hours. Like any other person, we also have family issues like getting ration to them. Like everyone else, we also ask some acquaintance to get them essentials while we are away.”",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77009924,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-454951,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-worked-nonstop-during-lockdown-to-curb-virus-spread/articleshow/77008837.cms

166,['17/07/2020'],Rajasthan crisis: Ashok Gehlot-Sachin Pilot camps circulate audio-video clips to malign each other,"File photo of Ashok Gehlot (left) and Sachin Pilot

JAIPUR: In a development related to the prevailing political crisis in Rajasthan, chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s camp late Thursday night released three phone audio clips, two of which were allegedly between a Union minister and a rebel Congress MLA camping in Manesar speaking through a middleman about toppling the state government in the coming days.

Gehlot’s Officer on Special Duty (OSD) Lokesh Sharma sent the audio clips to TOI on WhatsApp with a brief unsigned note claiming that the Union minister and the Congress lawmaker were conspiring to topple the Gehlot-government once they get their desired strength of 30 MLAs.

The CM’s OSD, however, did not take TOI’s phone calls made for his comments on the sent audio clips.

Later, the Pilot camp released a video clip of the accused MLA from Churu’s Sardarshahar Bhanwarlal Sharma refuting the allegations. “My audio that has gone viral is fake. CM’s OSD Lokesh Sharma sends his men to places to get fake audios prepared and to make phone calls to the MLAs,” said Sharma, adding “None of the MLAs would be pressurised by all this. This is a cheap act by the CM who is in despair.”

The OSD then sent a press statement accusing the seven-term MLA of conspiring against elected governments since the 1990s. “This is his 5th attempt to topple a government but he never succeeded,” the statement read, while recalling how the MLA attempted to topple the BJP government in 1996 despite Gehlot advising him not to do so on moral grounds as the then CM Bhairon Singh Shekhawat was abroad for medical treatment.

In one of the audio clips sent by the OSD, a person is heard saying, “You people (Pilot camp MLAs) should stay strong and continue to reside there only (in Manesar) for 10-15 days. The ‘Raj’ (state government) cannot keep its MLAs (in a Jaipur hotel) for 15 days. The moment they are freed, they will reach us.”

The other man reacts saying, “I also understand the government cannot function from hotel and that they do not have the number strength.”

The conversation in a local dialect between the two begins with one of them identifying himself with a name that is similar to that of one of the Union ministers. The other man greets him by saying, “Being the elder, let me bless you: ‘vijayi bhav’ (victory be yours).”

The man said to be the MLA said the ‘required numbers’ would be reached in a day or two, while the man said to be the Union minister reacted by saying, “The moment the numbers are reached, they (Gehlot camp) will be on their knees.”

The third audio clip is alleged to be of another rebel MLA speaking to an unidentified person about exchange of money.

KANPUR: Though the Ganga barrage is one of the beautiful places of the city, and also the most favourable place for selfie lovers, Parivartan, a social organization has developed one more place for selfie lovers a few hundred metre away from the barrage.

The place is a botanical garden, the KDA’s dream project . KDA, which developed the infrastructure of the botanical garden, had to drop the project due to some objection raised by the National Green Tribunal and also due change in policies.

The incomplete infrastructure, situated between the Ganga barrage and Mandhana road , which was lying barren and had become a desolate place, was adopted by Parivartan under its Kayakalp project. The combination of colours made the infrastructure so beautiful that people started visiting here for picnics and taking selfies.

The artist, Raghav Tripathi decorated the incomplete infrastructure by colour combination, pictures and combination of colour portraits. Every imagination which is a piece of art speaks for itself.

Municipal commissioner Akshay Tripathi who inaugurated the place on Thursday said that Parivartan had made it so beautiful that people would prefer to visit it again and again. Anil Gupta and Anoop Kumar Dwivedi, who are associated with Parivartan, said that efforts were going on to make it more beautiful and convert the entire area into a green cover.

“Our organization has so far planted as many as 928 saplings on both sides of the road which are being protected by tree guards. Every member of the organization has adopted one plant”, said Anoop.

He said that his organization had already made an appeal to the residents to come forward and plant a sapling. The organization would display a card on the tree guard mentioning the name of the person who has adopted the tree, Anoop said and added that several people had expressed their willingness to take part in it.

An antibody test is a blood test that determines whether someone has ever been infected with the novel coronavirus. “The results of the survey will help the government plan policies for further management of the novel virus, he said. We will be starting the study soon,” he said.Separately, Greater Chennai Corporation will draw blood samples from at least 12,000 people across all wards. The city samples will help the civic body narrow down on micromanagement plans for the city, which is the worst hit district.A survey done in May by ICMR in Chennai, Tiruvannamalai and Coimbatore districts as part of the national survey showed that the sero-prevalence was between 1% and 2% of the population. A repeat survey will show if the disease has travelled deeper into the community, officials said.While real time RT-PCR is the frontline test for clinical diagnosis for the viral infection, antibody tests are critical for surveillance to understand the proportion of the population that has been exposed to infection. Though antibody tests are scientific and ideal for testing large numbers, TN has made RT-PCR the sole test for diagnosing the viral infection.Many states use a combination of antigen and RT-PCR tests, but TN’s health department said it will use only the latter. “If a person tests positive in an antigen test it is confirmed positive.

JAIPUR: Amidst rumours that he had joined the Pilot camp in Delhi, CPM MLA Girdharilal clarified that he is very much in Rajasthan and will abide by the party’s decision.

The other CPM MLA Balwan Poonia, who has been suspended by the party for voting in support of the Congress candidate in the Rajya Sabha elections, too, is with the Gehlot camp.

The CPM, which has two MLAs in the Rajasthan assembly, has alleged that the current political crisis has been engineered by the BJP.

The state secretary of the party, Amraram told TOI that the BJP had started its conspiracy by fielding a second candidate in the recent Rajya Sabha elections. But after failing, now it has come out openly challenging all the democratic niceties and Constitutional values.

Amraram further alleged, “Democracy, secularism, federalism and the Constitution have been directly attacked in the country ever since the BJP-RSS government was formed under the leadership of Narendra Modi at the Centre.”

The elected state governments in Karnataka, Goa, Madhya Pradesh were toppled by open-ended purchases of MLAs like sheep and goat.

The misuse of Raj Bhavan, Income Tax department, ED and CBI has become the order of the day for the BJP. He expressed surprise and regret at how the Congress president and other senior leaders fell prey to the machinations of the BJP-RSS.

Gehlot govt will last five years: Kachariyawas

Gehlot government had lasted five years with just 96 MLAs in 2008, now there are 109 MLAs with the government. The BJP's conspiracy to destabilise the Congress government will not succeed, claimed Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas on Thursday.

He said people voted for the Congress and the same people won on Congress symbol now stand with BJP and claims the government had lost majority is dishonouring the peoples mandate.

“If any MLA makes a statement that the government is in a minority, it directly reflects the nexus with the BJP,” he said.

He alleged that the Income tax, ED and CBI started raids at the behest of the central government in a clear signal that the central government has come out in the open to threaten the Congress workers and leaders. The entire arrangement of Manesar hotel in Haryana is being done by BJP and the police personnel of the BJP government of Haryana are working round the clock to keep a watch on MLAs, he alleged.

HYDERABAD: Private teachers , allegedly neglected by the school managements and the state government , are now seeking help from their counterparts working in government institutions .

Members of the Telangana Private Teachers Forum (TPTF) say that they can survive the crisis only if every government teacher helps three private teachers by buying them essentials.

“As teachers, we always tell our students to help others. I feel it’s time to put our words into action. If government teachers help us on humanitarian grounds, lakhs of private teachers can survive,” said Shabir Ali, president, TPTF.

Private teachers said that if each government teacher contributes a day’s salary, all private teachers can get essentials. “This would also force managements and state government to act,” he added.

They said that they are trying to get in touch with Member of Legislative Councils (MLCs) and several government teachers’ associations seeking help.

Members of government teachers’ associations said they have received a request from private schools on the issue but are yet to take a decision. They said that survival is hard for them too as the government imposed a 50% pay cut.

The private teachers in the state have not been paid salaries for the last five months. Many have been struggling to survive and are taking up menial jobs to earn a livelihood.

With the affiliation process in its last lap, JNTUH has seen a surge in the number of colleges applying for emerging technology courses this year. Many have discontinued traditional courses such as chemical engineering and electronics and have added additional number of seats in emerging technology courses. “A total of 150 colleges have applied for affiliations and a majority of them have sought permissions to run computer science engineering in AI and ML, data science, cybersecurity etc.,” said Manzoor Hussain, registrar, JNTUH.

All the colleges will be following the model curriculum issued by the All India Council of Technical Education for the six new courses in emerging technologies. The university is also helping college managements train faculty members in these new courses in association with industry experts.

Recently, the university’s Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security held a faculty development programme on cyber security and forensics for 80 teachers.

Overall, close to 80,000 seats are expected to be on offer for various engineering streams in the state this year. Last year, as many as 88,199 seats were available in various engineering colleges of which 78,729 seats were on offer in colleges affiliated to JNTUH.

JAIPUR: The condition of sanitation in the city has been degrading every day for the last one week with contractors responsible for garbage collection on strike.

The BVG company, responsible for garbage collection, is at loggerheads with the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) regarding payment issues. Despite assurance that vehicles will start garbage collection, nothing could be soon on the ground yet.

Garbage collection vehicles (hoopers) are not going to majority of the areas of Walled City, Tilak Nagar, C-Scheme, Moti Doongri zone, Mansarover and Malviya Nagar . Residents are complaining of piles of garbage on roads and at their homes.

Pinky Taneja, a resident of Raja Park, said garbage collection vehicles are not coming to the area from the last one week. “We kept the garbage at our house for a while, but then we started throwing it on an empty plot or at the roadside. We didn’t have any choice as my house starting stinking,” Pinky said.

Whereas residents of Walled City do not have empty plots to throw the garbage so they have been dumping it on roadsides. Garbage depots have made a comeback in the Walled City and vehicles are not coming on time to clean them up.

JMC additional commissioner Arun Garg said they are in talk with the contracting company to resolve the issue. “We are having meetings regularly to resolve the issue with the contractors. In most of the areas hoopers are going except a few places,” Garg said.

Though situation is completely opposite on the ground. Vikas Kothari, former councillor from Walled City, said he is getting calls from people regarding sanitation problems. “In the last one week, the situation has turned worse. JMC and the government are not concerned about the situation. The government’s MLAs are in a hotel dealing with political crisis. This issue has to be dealt on urgent basis,” said Kothari.

TUTICORIN: A 45-year-old man was arrested for raping and impregnating his 14-year-old daughter in Tuticorin district. The incident came to light on Wednesday when the girl fell ill and was taken to the Pudur primary health centre (PHC). Since the girl is in her 7th month of pregnancy, doctors have expressed concern over terminating the pregnancy.

The accused Karuppasamy , an alcoholic, is engaged in making coal from firewood. He is married to two sisters and a has daughter each through both wives. Both families live separately in a village near Pudur. The victim is the second wife’s daughter and is studying Class 9 in a government school. He mother is working as a labourer.

According to police, preliminary inquiries with the girl revealed that she was raped by her father in an inebriated condition when she was alone in her house on December 14 and 15. He threatened to kill her if she told anyone. On Wednesday, she was taken to the Pudur PHC after falling sick. The PHC confirmed her pregnancy and she was referred to the Thoothukudi Government Medical College and Hospital.

Based on her statement, Karuppasamy was booked under sections 5(n) (relative of a child having a domestic relationship with a parent of the child commits penetrative sexual assault on such child), 5(l) (penetrative sexual assault on a child more than once), 5(j)(ii) (impregnating a girl child) and 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. He was also booked under Section 506(i) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code . As the man went into hiding, a team led by the inspector of Ettayapuram police station, Kala arrested him from a hideout and handed him over to the Vilathikulam all women police station (AWPS).

District child protection officer, B Jothikumar said the girl expressed willingness to abort the foetus after counselling. “But doctors said the baby has fully grown and it would be dangerous to carry out the procedure now. They have taken scans and other tests based on which they would be able to take a decision,” he said.

The girl is weak and has a very less haemoglobin count, due to which she needs to be administered with blood. As she had cold at the time of admission, swab samples were collected from her for Covid-19 test.

182,['17/07/2020'],"Nagpur boy scores 99.23%, is likely Maharashtra topper","Representative image

NAGPUR: With a rock solid 99.23% in his kitty, local boy Chaitanya Iyer is most likely to be the overall state topper in HSC . A student of science stream at Ambedkar College, Chaitanya, was overjoyed to see his marks were more than he had expected.

“I was expecting a good score, no doubt, but now being told that I might be the state topper is too surreal,” said an obviously beaming Chaitanya. The reason no one can really be sure of the ‘state topper’ tag is because Maharashtra government does not release a merit list. The toppers rankings are based solely on data shared either by schools or by students/parents.

Scoring high is not new to Chaitanya. He had bagged 97.8% in his SSC (Std X) too. He’s pleased that his latest feat is doing the city proud. “I was born and brought up here, so feel proud to be a Nagpurian,” he said.

Unlike most of his peers, Chaitanya is not looking to go for IIT or medical field. “I want to be an economist, but want an engineering degree. So there is an interesting dual degree in engineering and economics being offered at BITS-Pilani, which I am planning to study,” said Chaitanya.

He has absolutely no plans for going abroad either for studies or work. “I love my country and want to serve it. It would be great if I can join the Indian Economic Service (IES) after finishing my studies,” said Chaitanya. The IES is an inter-ministerial and inter-departmental service. The posts are primarily located in ministries/ departments dealing with economic and social sectors in the Government of India.

Chaitanya comes from a humble background, one which fosters self study. “My father is a professor and mother a homemaker. They never pressured me about studies or marks, and that helped me a lot,” said Chaitanya. Last year, he lost his maternal grandfather, and that came as a jolt. “It is his blessings due to which I have achieved these marks,” he added.

To de-stress, Chaitanya loves to play the keyboard. “I love listening to AR Rahman’s music, and playing a mix of classical and modern music on my keyboard,” said Chaitanya. He gives credit to his college for helping him learn techniques of approaching the exam and time management.

Kabir Rawlekar, vice-principal of Ambedkar College, said “Chaitanya was kind of an all-rounder. An extremely regular student and took active part in science exhibitions too.”

JAIPUR: As Sachin Pilot has been removed as the minister for rural development and panchayati raj and with no minister at the helm of affairs now, a large number of files pertaining to questions raised in the state assembly, transfer/postings and policy decisions are getting stacked up at the department, according to officials.

Pilot also held charge of Public Works Department (PWD). Apart from Pilot, Ramesh Chand Meena and Vishvendra Singh have also been removed as food and civil supplies and tourism ministers, respectively. According to officials, files are getting stacked up in these departments as well (PWD, food and civil supplies and tourism). Meanwhile, Pilot has sent all the files, marked to him, back to the departments.

When there is no minister in a particular department, the files are automatically marked to the chief minister, said officials. A senior official in the government said, “It does affect the functioning of a department when there is no minister in-charge. Most of the departments are waiting for the appointment of new ministers for clearance of the files. The government should have appointed new ministers in vacant posts immediately.”

“The files related to proposals to be sent to the finance department and DOP are usually forwarded to them after the approval of the minister. There is a Rs 66-crore watershed development fund, under which there will be a watershed bhavan (office and training centre) at every district headquarter. We cannot spend that money without the approval of the finance department. That file, too, has come back to the department from the former minister’s office,” said the official. “Also, files related to change in-service rules, up-gradation or creation of new posts, changing the guidelines/rules in the existing schemes/programmes or introducing new schemes are sent to DOP with the approval of the minister.”

184,['17/07/2020'],BJP ally Beniwal accuses former CM Raje of helping Gehlot,"Jaipur: Rashtriya Loktantrik Party national convenor Hanuman Beniwal has accused Vasundhara Raje of coming to the rescue of chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his government.

In a series of tweets, he attacked Raje of coming to the aid of the beleaguered chief minister in the ongoing power struggle within the Congress.

“Former CM Vasundhara Raje making a strong effort to save the minority government of Ashok Gehlot. Raje has also made calls to many Congress MLAs,” he claimed.

“Vasundhara called her close friends in the Congress. She asked one Jat MLA each from Sikar and Nagaur districts asking to keep distance from Sachin Pilot”, tweeted the Nagaur MP who is an alliance partner of the BJP.

In another tweet citing media reports he said, “Gehlot himself claimed that he had call recording (of the alleged deal) with him. Tapping phone is a violation of the rights given by the Constitution. Gehlot ji is doing such tricks which are not worthy of him,” said the Jat leader.

Beniwal, a former BJP MLA was kicked out of the BJP in 2013 due to his antagonistic relations with the former chief minister in 2013. After parting ways with the BJP, he contested as an independent from the Khinvsar assembly seat in Nagaur in 2013 assembly election and won. He formed the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party in 2018 before the assembly elections. His party won in three assembly seats including himself.

Considering his popularity among the youth in his community, the BJP had formed an alliance with him in the last parliamentary elections and he won the Nagaur seat.

Beniwal’s allegations assumes importance in the light of the fact that Raje has been keeping a silence on the political development in her home state. Raje who is camping in Delhi was supposed to come to Jaipur on Wednesday but it was cancelled after Pilot ruled out an alliance with the BJP.

Pilot had also in a lashed out at the Gehlot government for going all the way to Supreme Court in appealing against the high court order to save the bungalow allotted to the former chief minister at 13- Civil Lines despite the party opposing such a provision for former chief ministers.

Pilot also attacked Gehlot for not holding an inquiry into the mining scam during Raje’s tenure accusing him of hand-in-glove with her.

Two Raje loyalists question Pilot bungalow in Delhi

After Sachin Pilot questioned the allotment of bungalow to former chief minister Raje, two of her loyalists on Thursday questioned Pilot for keeping a government bungalow in Delhi. They said the former chief minister was allotted bungalow as a senior legislator not as former chief minister.

Two BJP MLAs, former minister Pratap Singh Singhvi and former speaker Kailash Meghwal, both from Raje camp said Pilot had a bungalow on 5-Canning Road and on what basis he claimed a high moral ground .

Rajkot: Residents of Rajkot were jolted out of their sleep after an earthquake of 4.8 intensity shook most parts of the city and villages of the district at 7:40am on Thursday.

The epicentre of the tremor was in Bhayasar village, 19 km from Rajkot, according to the Institute of Seismological Research, Gujarat

While there were no injuries to people, damage to properties were reported from some villages. The tremor was also felt in Amreli, Bhavnagar, Junagadh, Jamnagar, Porbandar and Devbhumi Dwarka districts.

“I was in deep sleep and heard a noise as if a big vehicle was passing by. By the time I could realize, I was already trembling in the bed. I rushed out of my apartment.” said Vijay Patel, a resident of Canal Road.

The quake brought back memories of the tremor of 5.8 intensity that had jolted the state on the night of June 14. The epicentre of that quake was near Bhachau in Kutch.

Rajkot Municipal Corporation issued the statement saying that there was no damage to the important installations.

Municipal commissioner Udit Agarwal also directed all the city engineers to verify the condition of building structures. “All the structures like Aji-1 dam, Aji pumping station, filter plant, Nyari-1 dam, Gauridad sewage treatment plant, Raiyadhar and Ghanteshwar water treatment plants, Raiyadhar sewage treatment plant, city bus and BRTS bus stops have been checked and no damage has been found because of the quake.”

TPCC chief Uttam Kumar Reddy demanded that a new building be constructed on OGH premises. “While protecting the heritage structures, the government should construct a new building on the same premises,” said Uttam, adding that he wanted to know why the government is not sanctioning Rs 500 crore for such an important structure. “For poor it is catch-22 situation. It’s high time a decision is taken for benefit of the poor,” a retired doctor of the hospital said.

HRC takes note of report

Meanwhile, the state human rights commission (TSHRC) took suo motu cognizance of a TOI report about sewage entering into OGH and called for a report from the hospital superintendent by August 21. The HRC also took suo-moto cognizance of another report with respect to the death one P Ramkumar, a TDP party city secretary, allegedly due to delay in treatment at Chest hospital, Erragadda.

This was primarily due to the performance of government schools as well as students in the differently abled category.

Out of the total 31,048 students who appeared for the examination in the district, 29,787 have passed. As usual, girls outnumbered boys in pass percentage with 97.50 % of them passing the exam compared to 93.99% boys.

Facing board examination for the first time after the new syllabus was introduced, it was challenging for the students as no blueprint was given.

Saying that subject toppers are more in commerce and humanities than in science this year, a government school teacher from Adnanallur block said that the highest marks in science stream last year was over 500 marks out of 600. But this year it has come down to 437. However the highest mark in commerce is 519 this year. This year, questions in science subject were relatively tougher which brought down marks, said the head master of government model girls higher secondary school, S Anbusekaran. Science being concept-based, and unless students are thorough with them, they may face difficulty. Humanities is a mixture of theory and concept which gave them an advantage in scoring marks, he said.

He said the dumping appeared to be a large-scale violation that could not be stemming from just one medical facility.“If you look at the quantity, it’s clear this is not coming from just one hospital or a quarantine facility, but from several,” noted Sharma. “Either this is being done illegally or the rules about disposal of biomedical hazards are being blatantly disregarded. This is a serious health risk to the sanitation workers and waste pickers and could well lead to community transmission of Covid-19 too.”Dinesh, who lives in a temple adjacent to the dumping site, said that he generally opens the shrine for people around 4am and has seen a truck come and dump cardboard boxes at the dhalao. “I take a bath around 3.30am and before I throw open the temple for early morning worshippers, I have spotted the truck bringing the hazardous waste,” he said, adding rather ruefully, “I have informed police, but as you can see nothing has been done.”TOI tried to contact North Delhi Municipal Corporation but received no response.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77011808,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-81684,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/truckloads-of-trouble-bio-med-waste-in-open-raises-infection-risk/articleshow/77008920.cms

NEW DELHI: New Delhi Municipal Council ( NDMC ) has initiated a drive early this week to send mobile teams to the ministries, the Supreme Court , Delhi high court and other important government offices .

Health teams will cover all government complexes where public footfall is high so that timely detection can help in containing Covid-19 infections. The drive has started on the direction of the New Delhi district disaster management office, said an official.

Health teams have so far arranged for antigen testing at the offices of the ministries of home affairs, textile, labour and employment, power, and water resources, and at Palika Bhawan in RK Puram, Lok Nayak Bhawan, the Supreme Court and Delhi high court. “If any result turns out to be suspicious, health teams conduct RT-PCR testing,” said an official.

Mobile teams visit these places daily or on alternate days based on requirement. Till Friday, 643 tests have been conducted and 13 have been found positive.

“To help health teams, teachers, lab technicians and staff from other departments are performing various duties such as supervising camps and on-the-ground coordination,” said an NDMC official. “We conduct tests of staff, lawyers, senior officials and others who want to use the facility.”

The civic agency is also receiving requests from many other bodies such as Press Club of India to arrange for such camps, he added.

NDMC has earlier started both antigen and RT-PCR testing in containment areas and buffer zones. Following encouraging response at its first antigen centre in Sarojini Nagar, it has opened up three more centres at Laxmi Bai Nagar, Malcha Marg and Moti Bagh. “Two of these are in our dispensaries and the one at Malcha Marg is a health centre. People living in nearby government quarters can get tested in these areas,” said the official.

PALANPUR: A 45-year-old man was detained on Thursday for allegedly raping his 16-year-old daughter and impregnating her in Sapra village , some 15 km from Patan.

On Wednesday last week, the girl complained to her mother about stomach ache. Her mother took her to the doctor who diagnosed the girl as pregnant.

“After taking her into confidence, the mother made her daughter confide in her and she revealed that her father had been sexually assaulting her. He had also threatened her with dire consequences if she complained about it to anyone,” said SP Khare, inspector with Saraswati taluka police station.

The woman then took her daughter to the police station and lodged the complaint against her father.

The accused is an alcoholic who used to work as a labourer. The survivor’s mother works as a maid.

“At present, we have detained the accused. He will be formally arrested once he undergoes Covid-19 test,” added Khare.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

JAIPUR: For fast-tracking investment and capacity expansion proposals by facilitating time-bound approvals and clearances, the state cabinet has approved ‘One Stop Shop’ scheme, earlier known as single window clearance system.

According to the scheme, entrepreneurs investing above Rs 10 crore will be able to get 98 types of clearances under one roof at the ‘One Stop Shop’ (OSS) under the Bureau of Investment Promotion of the industries department.

Officers from 14 departments like industries, RIICO, energy, labour, urban development, local self-governance, pollution control board, consumer affairs, tourism, revenue, factories and boilers, public works and PHED will be deputed to the One Stop Shop cell and will ensure that investment-related issues concerning multiple departments are received and addressed at one location to avoid unnecessary delay in clearances.

“Rajasthan government is committed to ensure a transparent and hassle-free ecosystem for investments coming to the state. Establishment of the OSS is in sequence with the various pro-industry measures taken by the government such as Rajasthan Industrial Development Policy (2019), Rajasthan Investment Promotion Scheme (2019) and MSME (Facilitation of Establishment and Operation) Act, 2019,” said Naresh Pal Gangwar, principal secretary, Industries.

The state cabinet has recently approved amendments in the ‘The Rajasthan Enterprises Single Window Enabling and Clearance Act, 2011’ and provided for the constitution of a Board of Investment under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister for the purpose.

Sources said issues related to large projects concerning land, incentive or disputes will be decided by the Board of Investment (BoI) so that high-value investments don’t face delays. The source said the BoI will have ministers of finance and industries as members along with the chief secretary and principal secretary of industries, while the Investment Commissioner will be the member secretary of the board. The board will decide issues which require consideration at government level.

Suresh Agarwal, president of Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry said, “In the current situation, the government needs to be pro-active to restart the state’s economy and industry. Elimination of bureaucratic hurdles will certainly enhance the attractiveness of the state as an investment destination. Strong revival of industrial investment will be key to creating jobs, demand and replenishing state’s coffers.”

Agarwal cited the response to the new MSME Act which has attracted over 5000 companies since it was launched in June last year. “These are small investments but the MSME Act reform has shown how industry comes forward if there is ease of doing business. We expect the OSS also creates that kind of comfort among investors,” added Agarwal.

196,['17/07/2020'],Shops in markets barricaded to maintain social distancing,"MADURAI: Markets have been barricaded to reduce the risk of contact in Madurai. The move comes after Paravai market in the outskirts of the city produced a cluster and cases were reported in the Madurai Central vegetable and fruit markets

People who went to the Anna Nagar farmers market were surprised to see barricades in front of each shop. Even though police personnel have been monitoring the crowds in these markets for over a month now, people still continue to violate safety norms. A market worker was even tested positive recently.

Customers were made to stand between the barricades in a line. “It was a time-consuming process, but better as it gave a sense of safety. Otherwise, people tend to crowd around a single vendor,’’ said Venkat Prabu of Anna Nagar. This market is to be closed for the next two days for disinfectant purposes.

The Mattuthavani vegetable market now operates with just 350 shops out of 700. President of the market, P S Murugan said that they are trying to minimize contact with the public to the best of their ability by functioning between 10 pm to 6 am for wholesale procurement and sales.

Meanwhile, the district administration has decided to shift the Paravai market to the satellite town in Kappalur . President of the Paravai market, Manuel Jeyaraj , said that news of their market turning into a cluster had been unwarranted as the 20 people who were tested positive have recovered. “But now the district administration has decided to shift our 300 shops to the satellite town and we have agreed,’’ he said.

HYDERABAD: After ramping up the Covid-19 tests by introducing the rapid antigen tests , the government has started distributing oximeters to health workers who go on field visits.

The health workers who are engaged in door-to-door fever survey, will measure the oxygen levels of the people with the oximeters. A pulse oximeter is a tool to monitor oxygen saturation level and can pick up Covid-induced hypoxia (low oxygen levels in the blood) early. Many Covid-19 patients who are asymptomatic turn critical suddenly with oxygen levels falling.

Delhi and Tamil Nadu governments, besides others are advising the people to buy and use the oximeters . The Tamil Nadu government has been advocating the use of these kits and has so far procured 25,000 such kits. Doctors in the state are advising the people to have simple oximeters at home with which one can check oneself. Delhi government went one step ahead and supplied oximetres free of cost to mild and asymptomatic patients who are under home isolation. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal termed these pulse oximeters ‘‘suraksha kavach’‘ (protective shield) that have helped reduce Covid-19 cases in Delhi. However, the Telangana government is not distributing the oximeters to people and giving them only to the health workers. Apart from the oximeters, thermal scanners have also been given to the health workers.

Rajkot: Tracking of lions near Port Pipavav and the vulnerable railway line connecting the port is likely to be affected with nearly 24 trackers of Shetrunji division going on a strike on Thursday.

The trackers are hired on contract by Gujarat State Lion Conservation Society, which is a part of the forest department, through third-party hiring. The trackers said they want to have direct contract with society and that no third-party should be involved in this crucial work. Shetrunji division was formed last year considering the increasing number of lions in Amreli. There are nearly 80 lions in this division.

Shetrunji range covers Rajula, Jafrabad, Port Pipavav and Liliya in Amreli district and Jesar and Talaja in Bhavnagar district and all these areas fall in revenue (non-protected) area.

According to sources, the major threat to lions here is the railway lion as the felines frequently saunter close to the tracks. These trackers play a major role in saving lions from going close to the railway line when trains are approaching. There have been several incidents where lions or their cubs have got crushed under the moving train. Also, it is usually during evening and late night that the lions move towards the track. These trackers inform higher officials about ill lions and accidents.

When contacted, Nisha Raj, deputy conservator of forest, Shetrunji wildlife division said, “Their contracts are yet to be renewed by the wildlife circle office. We are trying to bring an amicable solution to their grievances.”

CHENNAI: As many as 1,104 pregnant women who tested positive for Covid-19 have given birth at government hospitals across the state and were discharged from Covid wards following treatment. Of them, 374 were treated successfully at the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (IOG) in Chennai. This included last-minute referrals from private hospitals and those referred from Chennai Corporation’s fever camps.

The IOG’s Covid ward has so far recorded zero maternity deaths. Health minister C Vijayabaskar attributed it to a specialised admission and treatment protocol developed by the institute. Patients, who get admitted 10 days before the expected date of delivery are screened for Covid and sent to the ordinary labour ward only if they test negative.

Moms-to-be who test positive are admitted to the Covid ward and during their labour, a sterile cloth separated the patient and the doctors, nurses assisting the delivery. “All women shout due to labour pains and this means more droplets containing the virus gets released into the room. The sterile cloth acts as a separation and an added layer of safety for the doctors and nurses,” said S Vijaya, director of IOG.

All safety measures including this separation is used in cases of emergency admissions when there is no time to run Covid-19 tests prior to delivery.

To reduce Covid-19 exposure of healthcare professionals, hospitals opt to perform cesareans (C-section) deliveries after waiting for 6-8 hours, compared to the usual 24-hours wait time. This has increased the cesarean rate from 30% to 50%, she added.

A total of 491 pregnant women are undergoing treatment for Covid-19 across the state. In the case of newborns, around 10-12% test positive at comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (CEMONC) centres across the state and efforts are taken to prevent the infants from contracting the infection from their mothers, said Vijayabaskar.

RAJKOT: Five accused in the case of murder in an extramarital affair were arrested on Thursday.

In the case that happened at Lakadavandh village of Rapar taluka in Kutch district accused Dharma Koli along with his three sons — Satish, Gokal and Shiva and a nephew Haresh — had killed Babu Koli (32) on Wednesday afternoon on allegations of his extramarital affair with Dharma’s daughter Sita, said the police.

However, no sooner the news of the brutal murder of her paramour had reached the 19-year-old woman, she too took her own life by hanging to death from the ceiling of her house on the same day.

“After the complaint was lodged in the case, we went to Lakadavandh village and rounded up the accused. They will be formally arrested after they undergo Covid-19 test,” said B J Parmar , sub-inspector with Balasar police station.

According to the police, deceased Sita’s family members were against her relationship with Babu as the latter was married. They tried to put an end to the relationship and had also met Babu’s family members on the issue. At the meeting, a compromise was struck that the persons concerned will sever all ties with each other and never even try to contact each other.

But, Babu and Sita continued to talk over the phone.

When her family came to know about their continuing the relationship, an angered Koli decided to teach Babu a lesson.

208,['17/07/2020'],No postal ballots for voters above 65: EC,"PATNA: Amending its earlier order, the Election Commission (EC) on Thursday announced that the postal ballots facility will not be extended to voters above the age of 65. It cited logistics, manpower constraints and Covid-19 safety concerns in its implementation in the coming Bihar polls.

The facility will be limited to voters above the age of 80 and those engaged in essential services as well as Covid19 patients and suspected cases staying in quarantine.

The EC had earlier recommended extension of the postal ballot facility to voters above the age of 65 to minimise their vulnerability and exposure to Covid-19 virus at the polling booths. The Union ministry of law and justice had notified the amended rules on June 16.

In a press communique issued on Thursday, the EC said the decision was taken in view of the “constraints of logistics, manpower and safety protocols of the Covid19 pandemic”.

The opposition parties had opposed the rule. Last week a senior RJD leader and Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha wrote to the Election Commission registering the party’s serious objections over the amendments in the conduct of election rules by introducing the postal ballot system of voting for the people above 65 years of age without consultations.

Talking to TOI over the phone, Jha said on Thursday that the RJD was very happy over the EC’s decision. “The EC should always keep in mind that any decision should be taken only after consultations with the political parties,” he added.

The ruling BJP too welcomed the move. “BJP welcomes the decision of EC allowing postal ballot only to people above 80. RJD and Cong could have misused this facility as they were doing earlier by booth capturing,” said state BJP leader and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi.

Around 34,000 new polling booths would have to be added in the state after the voters’ strength at each polling booth has been restricted to not more than 1,000 to minimise the chances of the voters getting infected with the virus.

Similarly, 1.8 lakh additional polling personnel and a large number of vehicles would be required to deal with 1.06 lakh polling booths for the upcoming assembly poll as well as byelection in the state. “The new challenges came to light during frequent assessment of field preparations in the run up to the elections in the state,” the EC release issued by the Press Information Bureau revealed.

The elections are due for October November this year. However, opposition parties, including RJD, have demanded to postpone the election in the wake of a surge in the Covid19 positive cases. The RJD has also got support from Lok Janshakti Party chief Chirag Paswan on the issue.

Till Wednesday, 45% of beds in the city earmarked for Covid-19 were vacant.

The administration handling the Covid-19 crisis had charted out a plan of increasing the number of beds in a phased manner in hospitals in the city as well as on its outskirts.

Apart from the two government hospitals, it was ensured that private medical institutes as well as other public sector hospitals like the Railway Hospital, ESIS Hospital and Infectious Diseases Hospital provide free beds for treatment.

The total number of beds stood at 2,528 till Wednesday and was increased to 3,000 from the same day. Officer on special duty for Covid-19 Vinod Rao said that the plan was to further raise the capacity to 5,000 in the first week of August. “Our projections and plans made in mid-April are turning out to be almost accurate,” he said.

Rao added that out of the 1,388 patients in hospitals in the city, 212 are from outside the Vadodara district. He added that people from nearby areas were coming to the city for good services. Covid-19 patients from Ahmedabad, Surat, Bharuch, Anand, Kheda, Godhra, Mahisagar, Dahod, Narmada and Vapi districts have been admitted to city hospitals.

The civic body in consultation with the association of private hospitals in the city has already fixed the rates for treatment of patients depending on the kind of hospital and the type of interventions that the patient might need.

210,['17/07/2020'],Increase surveillance in five high viral load districts: UP CM Yogi Adityanath,"Chief minister Yogi Adityanath presiding over a meeting in Lucknow on Thursday

LUCKNOW: The government will be increasing surveillance and contact tracing in five districts, including Lucknow which recorded the highest 308 Covid-19 cases in a day on Thursday, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Kanpur and Jhansi. The decision was taken by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath at a meeting on Thursday night in which he also added that rapid antigen testing should also be increased in these districts. The CM has also raised concerns about the increasing number of hotspots in the state, which by Thursday had touched 4,510.

With 2,083 positive cases on Thursday, UP recorded its highest number of corona positive cases on a single day. During Thursday evening’s review, head of the pulmonary and critical care department in KGMU, Dr Ved Prakash, informed the CM that the number of cases was rising at present due to a high level of humidity in monsoon. He has also advised the CM that unlike the current protocol where asymptomatic patients are also being kept in institutional quarantine, those either not displaying symptoms or showing mild symptoms should be kept in home isolation. According to Dr Prakash, 80% of the cases are asymptomatic or mild, 15% are moderate and only 5% require critical care.

A committee of directors and senior doctors from PGI, KGMU and RML will be constituted in the coming days to prepare a roadmap for arresting the rise in Covid-positive patients in the state.

Awanish Awasthi, additional chief secretary (home), said that there are currently 10.55 lakh houses under hotspot zones where 62 lakh people are under surveillance. “A detailed review will be carried out to analyse why cases are rising and how to prevent the spread of the virus,” he said.

While reviewing the situation in the five sensitive districts, the CM stressed on strengthening the surveillance system to identify Covid-19 cases at the earliest so that they can be hospitalised on time, ensuring both timely treatment and preventing the virus from spreading to others. “In these five districts which have become areas of concern, contact tracing has to be increased to 100% and expedited to identify all those exposed to an infected person. While testing will be increased in these districts, antigen testing will help in showing results faster,” the official said.

He added that the CM has also directed officials to keep L2 and L3 Covid hospitals free for serious cases and therefore, asymptomatic cases should only be referred to L1 hospitals. “Exception will only be made for those older than 65 years or those with comorbidities,” the official added.

On Thursday, Jhansi reported 113 cases, followed by Varanasi with 78, Prayagraj with 56 and Kanpur City with 51 cases.

The CM has also directed all nodal officers appointed for each of the 75 districts, one each from the administration and the police force, to reach their assigned districts latest by Friday night to be able to supervise the weekend restrictions which have been put in place from this month. The officials have been tasked with monitoring the special sanitation and sanitization drives, availability of potable water, condition of hospitals and implementation of rules. Fogging has to be done compulsorily in each district.

Special attention will be given to police barracks to ensure that the infection does not spread among the police force. The CM has directed officials to create a protocol for quarantine in case a personnel has had to leave the barrack for any reason.

Release all the incarcerated voices of democracy and uphold their right to life,” the letter said.In May, the wheelchair bound Saibaba moved a parole application before the HC through his brother to visit Hyderabad, citing his mother’s cancer. But after the prosecution led by special public prosecutor Prashant Sathianathan informed that the area in Cyberabad was declared as Covid containment zone, the plea was rejected. His brother applied again for parole almost a month ago, but there is no response from the concerned jail authorities, his family members said.According to Saibaba, who was awarded life term by the Gadchiroli court for anti-national activities, one prisoner from Anda Cell, where he was kept with 20 others, was found to be positive on July 8.“The disease has reached very close to me. It’s only a ‘matter of time’ since it reaches my cell. Even officers contracted the deadly virus and there is no special care or treatment to combat it. Despite several preventive measures, it infected hundreds of prisoners, including convicts, under trials and even the jail guards,” the 53-year-old said in his application.In conversation with his wife on July 6, Saibaba told her that once infected, he can’t recover and survive. He said that he was twice taken to Super Speciality Hospital (SSH) here during lockdown and advised to undergo more tests and also prescribed some pain killers. MRI scan and other tests were conducted, but reports have not been given so far.

THANJAVUR: She was a kindergarten student when she lost her brothers aged eight and ten years in the 2004 Kumbakonam school fire tragedy which claimed 94 lives. But, on the 16th anniversary of the incident on Thursday, the girl, now a UG student at a private women’s college, says she misses the love, affection and care of her long-gone brothers very much.

I Jansirani was three when the fire accident took place, when she was too young to understand what had happened or where her two brothers were. But as she grew up and reality dawned, she realised what she had lost, especially on seeing many siblings moving together. “Many of my classmates have brothers. Whenever they arrive at the college to drop and pick up my friends I feel a pain in my heart”, Jansirani said.

Her father K Inbaraj , who lost sons I Aanadharaj and I Praveenraj who were studying in class V and III, appealed to the government to announce July 16 as Children Protection Day to create awareness among parents as well as school authorities on protecting students. “I lost both my kids in the incident, but that should not happen to anyone else. Announcing a day remembering the accident will create awareness on safety of students”, Inbaraj told TOI.

For Antonydoss and Rosemary , who also lost their sons A Aravind, 10, a class V student, and A Anishkumar, 8, a class III student, in the accident, lamented that they have none to take care of them now. Though Antonydoss was a loadman and running his family with a meagre income, he nursed big dreams and spent all his earnings on the education of the boys. However, everything came down crashing all on a sudden for them, recalls Rosemary.

“My husband lost his job as he met with an accident a year ago. We have neither money for food nor children to take care of us. If our children were alive, they might have started to earn. We would not have faced this present state of misery”, Rosemary told TOI. “It’s not only our fate, parents of many other victims will also be going through a similar situation,” she added.

A total of 94 children were charred to death and 18 others grievously injured in the fire accident on July 16, 2004, at Krishna English Medium School in Kumbakonam which was blamed on short circuit. Three children escaped with minor injuries. Parents and relatives of the children who lost their lives paid their homage at a memorial in Kumbakonam on Thursday.

While some managements of private schools have paid salaries of teachers for April, May and June, they say they are unable to pay from July onwards. Also, some temporary teachers are being removed from the job.Taking a cue from education minister S Sureshkumar, who has appealed to teachers of government schools to contribute their two days’ salary towards making payment to the staff of unaided schools, many private managing committees have asked the staff of aided schools to make the contribution. Some managing committees have cut the salaries of the unaided staff by 15-25%.“Unless the schools reopen and we start collecting fees, we can’t pay teachers’ salaries,” said a secretary of a private educational institution.Horatti opposes govt’s moveMeanwhile, MLC and former education minister Basavaraj Horatti has taken serious exception to seeking contribution from teachers of aided schools. “Those running unaided English medium schools collect hefty fees from students and pay paltry sum to teachers.

Ironically, the victim was also a money lender from whose house cops had recovered gold and silver jewellery worth Rs 1.56 crore. Against such a whopping amount, the victim owed the accused just Rs 3.50 lakh.

Police said the victim identified as Hitesh Goraviya had hanged himself to death from the ceiling of the bathroom of his nephew Piyush Parekh on June 8. At Parekh’s house Goraviya had come to stay as a guest along with his family members.

The police booked Bhabhalu Varu, Shailesh Mithapur, Shiva Varu, Alig Chandu, Pratap Chandu, Jairaj Chandu and Mangalu Chandu on the complaint of Goraviya’s wife Meena Goraviya .

“In her complaint, Meena said that Hitesh owed the accused Rs 3.50 lakh that he had taken as a loan from them, for the recovery of which the accused were harassing him,” said an official from University police station.

After Hitesh’s suicide, when the Amreli police raided his house in Nageshri village of Jafrabad taluka in Amreli district, they found gold and silver jewellery worth Rs 1.56 crore.

It was found during the investigation that both Hitesh and his father Vaju Sheth worked as the money lenders in Nageshri village.

HYDERABAD: Overcrowded graveyards and failure to find a piece of land for a fresh cemetery is forcing many in Telangana ’s Christian community to change the final rites of their dead. There have been a number of instances where the community has cremated those who have passed away.

“We had to cremate two bodies in Erragadda area in the last 10 days as we could not find a piece of land for them,” said G Solomon Raj of the Christian Burial Grounds for Greater Hyderabad, an umbrella organisation of small and independent churches.

The small and independent churches have been facing this problem for the past few years with Raj saying that in the last couple of years, several bodies have been cremated.

Though there are several cemeteries in Greater Hyderabad belonging to various denominations of Christians, the burial space is almost exhausted, and in many cases old graves have been excavated again to provide space to the mortal remains of another family member.

Pastor Mulkala Bhaskar of Bethel Bible Fellowship Church , Kompally, told TOI that 25-year-old N Babu was cremated in February at Smashana Vatika (cremation grounds) near Kompally bridge.

“Initially, the Smashana Vatika management committee refused to allow a Christian body to be cremated but then gave permission after requests from community elders. We believe in burying our loved ones as we expect resurrection in the life hereafter, but circumstances have forced us to make changes. Babu and his parents were church members,” said Pastor Bhaskar.

S Anand was also cremated at another Smashana Vatika in February. Rajanna, 50, was cremated in Parsigutta cremation grounds, said Pastor B Abraham of Christu Viswasa Pradhana Mandiram. “I had baptised Rajanna. His mother who died few years back, found place at the Narayanguda cemetery, but Rajanna did not,” Pastor Abraham said.

The pastors and families of the deceased did not give full details in view of the issue being sensitive but said other communities in several cases, discretely allowed for cremation of Christians in Smashana Vatikas.

In another case, a minor girl was buried in Smashana Vatika in August 2019. “One of the members of the management committee of the cremation grounds asked us to remove the coffin as it is not allowed in their cremation ground. The coffin was removed, and the girl was buried in the cremation ground,” said Pastor Talla Satyam of Mount Zion Church.

CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday informed the Madras high court that it has only sent a proposal to the central wildlife board to denotify a portion of Vedanthangal bird sanctuary and that unless it grants the nod, the state cannot proceed with the demarcation.

The state made the submission on a PIL moved by advocate S Stalin Raja challenging the move.

Recording the submission, the first bench of chief justice A P Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed the petitioner to approach the central board for any relief and disposed the plea.

According to the petitioner, the move has been proposed to benefit commercial and industrial development, including that of Sun Pharmaceuticals which has operations bordering the sanctuary.

Since 1998, Vedanthangal tank and the area within 5km of its boundary have been a part of the wildlife sanctuary with full protection under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. But on January 23 relying on the notes put up by the principal chief conservator of forest and chief wildlife warden , the Tamil Nadu government tabled a proposal with the state board for wildlife to denotify an area contained in a circular band within 3km the tank, he added.

RAJKOT: Realizing that there was no future to their relationship, a couple ended their lives by consuming pesticides in Goij village of Khambhalia taluka in Devbhoomi Dwarka district on Wednesday night.

The deceased were identified as Mahendra Vijhoda (22) and Bhumi Madam (19). Mahendra used to work as a farm labourer.

According to police, while Mahendra belonged to Dalit community from Goij village, Bhumi was an Ahir from Kothavisotri village of Khambhalia taluka.

“Bhumi’s family members were dead against the relationship, owing to Mahendra’s lower-caste origins. Both knew that they will never succeed in getting her parents to agree to their marriage and so they decided to end their lives,” an official from Salaya police station said.

“In their suicide note, the couple wrote: ‘We love each other, and as we can’t get united, we have decided to end our lives.’ The lovelorn duo was found tied to each other’s legs with the girl’s dupatta while an empty bottle of pesticide was found lying near the spot,” the official added.

The festival is barely two weeks, but both the abattoir and the adjoining cattle market are shut, though East Delhi Municipal Corporation officials said the slaughterhouse could open next week.Besides the Covid lockdown restrictions, the abattoir has also been mired in the matter of extension of the 10-year lease and so remained closed since March. EDMC officials said that though the private concessionaire had been permitted now to start functioning with anti-Covid measures in place, there was some holdup due to the expiry of the lease. “The private company hasn’t restarted operations, and the cattle market can resume business only if the slaughterhouse is functioning,” said a civic official. “There was a demand for prolonging the lease, and a two-year extension has been granted.”Gulfam Qureshi, who heads the Livestock Market Traders’ Association, said a letter to this effect has been issued by EDMC. “I was present at the meeting when permission for operations of the slaughterhouse and livestock market was given,” he said. Mohammad Arshad Qureshi, who heads the Delhi Meat Merchants’ Association, claimed after the issuance of the letter that things are “likely to return to normalcy before Bakri Eid”. “So many livelihoods depend on business here,” he said, pointing out that people from Haryana, UP and Rajasthan came to Ghazipur to sell their animals, putting lakhs of goats, sheep and buffalos on sale every year.Gulfam Qureshi cautioned, “If the market does not open, it will lead to nuisance across Delhi as illegal meat markets are sure to crop up.” He said that if the private concessionaire still did not resume operations, the traders would gherao the EDMC headquarter on July 22. “The whole of India has opened up, but this facility has remained shut for four months,” Gulfam Qureshi said. “If the company doesn’t want to run the slaughterhouse, the municipal corporation should run it.

AHMEDABAD: In response to the Pakistan High Commission’s habeas corpus petition for custody of its citizen, who could not leave India even after acquittal in a fake currency case, the state government on Thursday told the HC that it would challenge the acquittal before the Supreme Court.

However, the bench of Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice N V Anjaria has asked the state government to explain why it took one year to decide to challenge the acquittal of the Pakistani national . The judges have sought detailed explanation in this regard. The HC has sought details from the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) Mumbai to explain why exit visa was not issued to the Pakistani citizen after acquittal.

The case involves 28-year-old Sajjad Vora from Karachi, who had come to Surat to meet his relatives in 2016. He was allegedly found in possession of fake Indian currency at Surat railway station while the family was on its way to Mumbai. Vora was arrested, but acquitted in 2018 after a trial. The state government’s appeal as dismissed in July 2019 by the high court.

After his acquittal, Vora requested the FRRO, Mumbai for exit visa because his visa had expired in 2017. FRRO insisted on an NOC from Surat railway police, which was not given to him and the FRRO did not issue him exit visa. Vora pproached the HC in June for directions to FRRO and other immigration authorities to facilitate his return.

Meanwhile, the issue came to the notice of Pakistan government and its high commission approached the HC seeking custody of its national, who has been “illegally detained” in India against his will. The high commission stated that this absence of law in this case would “tarnish image of the nation”. It has alleged “subversion and erosion of law” in India in illegally detaining its citizen. It has also sought Rs 20 lakh compensation for Vora.

The HC will hear the case further on July 21.

226,['17/07/2020'],SC to examine validity of 52-year-old Kerala law prohibiting animal sacrifice in temples,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to examine the constitutional validity of a 52-year-old Kerala law that prohibits animal sacrifice in temples and issued notice to the Kerala government on petitions by priests alleging that it discriminated on the ground of religion, for it allowed sacrifice of animals by Muslims on Bakrid and in a ceremony in a particular church.

Petitioners, through senior advocates K V Vishwanathan and V Giri, argued that the state law — Kerala Animals and Birds Sacrifices Prohibition Act, 1968 — was also repugnant to the central law on the issue, Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, as the latter permitted animal sacrifice under customs of various religions.

Though the bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde, R S Reddy and A S Bopanna agreed to examine the validity of the state law, it said killing animals was permitted under the central law but cruelty was banned. Vishwanathan and Giri cited the example of periodic culling of stray dogs by almost all municipal authorities.

The SC tagged the petition with pending appeals against judgments of the High Courts of Himachal Pradesh and Tripura banning animal sacrifice in temples. In its interim order, the SC had said in these cases, ""If slaughter of animals is done for the purpose involved in the petitions, it shall be done in an area set up for the purpose by the municipal authorities.""

Petitioners challenging the Kerala law said it was unconstitutional as it singled out the Hindu community while giving permission to other religious groups to sacrifice animals and birds in connection with their religious customs. In addition to the reference to Bakrid when Muslims sacrifice animals, they mentioned the ""well known Edappally St George Church where birds are sacrificed within the church premises and cooked and eaten in connection with a religious practice”.

""The Kerala Act violates Article 15 of the Constitution as a state is discriminating solely on the basis of religion and singles out Hindu temples as a class to impose restriction without reasonable basis,"" the petitioners said. Section 28 of the Prevention of Cruelty Act (PCA) says, ""Nothing in this Act shall render it an offence to kill any animal in a manner required by religion of any community."" They said it also violated the fundamental right to religion and religious practices of Hindu community guaranteed under the Constitution.

The petitioners cited the SC's 2014 judgment in jallikattu case (bull running case) which said, ""The PCA has been enacted with an object to safeguard the welfare of animals and evidently to cure some mischief and age-old practices, so as to bring into effect some type of reform based on eco-centric principles recognising intrinsic value and worth of animals. All the same, the Act has taken care of the religious practices of the community, while killing an animal vide Section 28 of the Act.""

AHMEDABAD: The Union forest ministry committee report on lion deaths between January and May recommends the strengthening of field staff by filling the large number of vacancies on a priority basis. Positions of at least 250 beat guards and 85 foresters are vacant in the Gir (East) division, it says.

Against the approved strength of 208 foresters for Gir (East) division, existing strength is only 110. There are only 279 forest guards against the approved strength of 540.

In the case of the Junagadh wildlife circle , there are only 28 foresters against the sanctioned strength of 42 and 81 forest guards against the approved strength of 141.

The report of the forest ministry committee said that in the calendar year 2020, the total number of lion deaths in the landscape till May 31, was 85, of which 59 occurred in the Gir (East) division, in Dhari.

There are vacant positions in Gir sanctuary and the social forestry divisions.

Officials said in areas outside the protected area, especially revenue areas, social forestry officials manage wildlife. The chief conservator of forests (social forestry) is also engaged in the management of lions.

Officials said that social forestry divisions also have 30% vacancies.

The department had a strong informer network which helps keep a track on lions but in recent times there have been issues between villagers and the officials, said sources.

The central ministry report asked the state government to share daily reports on lion mortality in the Gir landscape. A clear standard operating procedure (SOP) needs to be developed with help from national institutions such as the IVRI and NIV, in coordination of Union forest ministry for prevention/prophylactic disease control.

The report recommends setting up of a special team comprising of an immunologist, an epidemiologist, virologists, parasitologists, clinical experts and ecologists for field visits to ascertain the actual cause of the recent deaths.

The committee recommended measures including expansion of the inviolate area by relocation of Maldhari nesses within the Gir protected areas.

As most are rushed to a hospital following breathlessness, hospitals have been asked to ensure monitoring of oxygenation status of patients in the holding area.Other interventions include effective triaging, or determining priority in care needed, with high priority accorded to high-risk individuals like the elderly, pregnant and paediatric patients, immune-suppressed patients with co-morbidities, cancer patients and transplant patients. Hospitals will have to minimise the time taken for admission procedures as much as possible and a dedicated, well-trained team should be made available round the clock for transportation of patients to appropriate treatment zones without delay.The next step is ‘clinical management’ during which the clinical guidelines given by the Union health ministry have to be followed. This includes oxygen therapy in a staged manner. Interventions include real-time monitoring of oxygen saturation and early warning scores that facilitate management when oxygen saturation falls.Hospitals will have to give hands-on orientation training to all healthcare workers engaged in Covid care. Adequate attention will have to be given to the management of co-morbidities. The advisory also suggests standardisation of investigation to prevent incomplete sampling, while advising close monitoring of the clinical condition of Covid-19 patients by specialists and senior residents at regular intervals and tele-consultation with experts from AIIMS, if required.As most critical Covid patients develop acute kidney injury, the advisory asks for continuous renal replacement therapy or sustained low efficiency dialysis with technicians to be made available.Separate interventions are part of the advisory for ‘critical care’, which includes the recommendation that every critical patient may be allocated one healthcare worker round the clock who will closely monitor his or her health. Hands-on training in critical care has to be given to doctors, nursing officer and technicians.For better inter-departmental co-ordination when it comes to critical care, the advisory recommends forming a single command and control structure. The advisory also recommends that various teams may be formed from the available pool of human resources, based on their expertise and the level of care to be provided to Covid-19 patients.For overall ‘Hospital Management’, the advisory says that proper asepsis (absence of bacteria, viruses etc.) should be maintained in all hospital areas for prevention of infection and checklists or charts can be maintained to ensure this.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77009891,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-200425,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-covid-worker-per-patient-to-stave-off-death/articleshow/77008996.cms

236,['17/07/2020'],Serial audio exposes: Don aide’s wife mobilised men to take sniper position,"Cops stand guard outside Vikas Dubey’s house when it was not razed

KANPUR: The serial tape exposes on the midnight ambush in Bikru village has again unearthed the role of women folk in destroying evidence, peddling don Dubey’s messages and misleading cops after the carnage. On Thursday, a fresh audio clip surfaced in which a woman can be heard asking her father-in-law Prem Prakash Pandey to quickly reach home and take sniper position on rooftops.

The voice in the 33-second audio clip is said to be that of Manu, wife of Vikas’ aide Sashikant Pandey , who was arrested on Tuesday.

Manu was taken into custody on Wednesday following surfacing of back-to-back audio clips in which she was found conniving with the gangster and his aides.

TOI, however, cannot verify the authenticity of the clips though Manu admitted to reporters on Wednesday it was her voice in the two earlier clips that went viral.

In the first call recording, Manu is heard enquiring about her father-in-law Prem Prakash Pandey’s location.

When informed that he’s in neighbouring Dibba Newada village, she requests him to rush home as Vikas Dubey had ordered menfolk to climb atop houses and take position with rifles due to an impending police raid.

In another 22-second audio tape, Pandey can be heard conveying the don’s directives to his son, Sashikant. He’s heard asking Sashikant to immediately contact him on his mobile. Police said, the conversation seems to be just hours before the ambush, in which eight policemen including DSP Devendra Mishra were killed.

Speaking to TOI, a police officer said, investigations revealed DSP Devendra Mishra had taken refuge in courtyard of Manu’s house to skirt the barrage of bullets from rooftops, but was killed after Manu apprised the gangster’s henchmen about the police officer’s location.

In the first viral audio on July 14, Manu could be heard admitting Dubey’s men had killed policemen and dumped three bodies near her door. She’s also heard discussing ways to dispose her mobile phones and mislead cops. “Two men died at my door, while another man died in my courtyard. Everyone has ran away, what will I say when police arrive,” she is heard telling her ‘bhabi’. Similarly, in another audio, a call recording between Manu and her brother went viral on Wednesday. In the conversation, Manu is heard telling her brother about destroying a SIM card and is repeatedly told to delete call details from his phone as well.

Manu’s father-in-law Prem Prakash Pandey was gunned down by police in an encounter, six hours after the Bikru ambush, while her husband, Sashikant was arrested on Tuesday.

Mobile phone of wives and women members of all 11 on-the-run accused have been seized by police. “Going by conversations in audio clips, there is ample evidence against Manu and we are questioning and corroborating her role in the Bikru ambush. We are going through call detail record of their cell phones to establish their links with slain gangster Vikas Dubey,” said SP rural Brijesh Kumar Srivastava while talking to reporters. Police had deferred the decision to free slain Dubey aide, Amar’s wife Khushi, who is currently in prison.

237,['17/07/2020'],Amaravati land scam: Probe reveals web records altered,"Hyderabad: Arrest of two key accused in the Amaravati land scam has unearthed the modus operandi of how the assigned lands were sold and used for land pooling.

The Thullur police had on Wednesday arrested Anne Sudhir Babu, a retired tehsildar, and Gummadi Suresh , a real estate businessman. In the remand report submitted in the court, the police explained that fabricated online land records were used for wrongful transfer of lands belonging to the landless people from scheduled caste communities.

In Pedalanka of Rayapudi village, around 7.4 acre was surrendered to the state government under land ceiling process. Police said that one Yalamanchali Suraiah and his two sons illegally got the land assigned to SCs by getting it registered in favour of Gummadi Suresh, posing as if it was their own.

Gummadi Suresh, in turn, executed a sale deed in 2016 to Valluri Srinivasa Babu as GPA holder. For registration, the accused submitted pattadar passbook, title deed and other documents issued by the then tehsildar Anne Sudhir Babu to support their claim.

Sudhir Babu was accused him of creating false documents by making changes in revenue records in connivance with Gummadi Suresh and others. Sudhir Babu issued six different reports with different dates to CRDA, changing the classification from “assigned land” to “patta land” and then from “patta land” to “assigned land” as a cover-up operation.

The third accused Valluri Srinivasa Babu, who is yet to be arrested, offered the assigned land to CRDA for pooling to grab the benefits (returnable plots/annuity) under land pooling scheme. Police said this case is the tip of the iceberg and hundreds of acres of land have been transferred using similar methods.

Now, carrying big dreams to be a doctor and a chartered accountant, R Sundararajan and R Meenakshi hope to become first generation graduates.

Studying in VHN higher secondary school for boys and girls respectively, Sundararajan secured 532/600 and Meenakshi, 556/600 marks in the exam. Both were Tamil medium students — Sundararajan studied science group with biology and maths and Meenakshi enrolled for commerce with business maths. Sundararajan top-scored among Tamil medium science group students in his school while Meenakshi ranked school first.

“I failed in Class X while my wife Jayalakshmi did not study beyond Class V. Since 2008, my wife has been suffering from mental illness and requires medication. It is a struggle for us as we have to handle her if she throws a fit and get her to take her medication. I could do little to nothing to help my children study,” said Radhakrishnan N, father of the twins. He is a supplier for a private tea company and earns around Rs 10,000 per month, the only source of income for the family.

“We don’t have anyone to teach us at home and study by ourselves. Our school teachers taught us well and we were able to do well. I want to be a doctor and am preparing for Neet now,” said Sundararajan. Inspired by her father, Meenakshi wants to be a chartered accountant. Both students have also been school toppers in their Class X exams as well. “I couldn’t be prouder of my children who have put in so much hard work, which is why I do whatever I can to help them continue studies. However, now with Covid-19 pandemic too, I’m not sure how far I’ll be able to support their higher studies but I want to make sure they continue,” said Radhakrishnan. He also has an elder daughter, R Mala , who is now studying first year at Sri Meenakshi Government College for Women.

MUMBAI: P Varavara Rao , the 79-year-old poet and activist who has been in jail for nearly two years in the Elgar Parishad case, tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, sparking calls from his family and admirers for his release.

Rao was admitted to JJ Hospital on Monday night after he fell ill and underwent a series of tests. Hospital authorities said he was shifted to St George’s Hospital on Thursday evening as JJ is a non-Covid hospital. “He is not showing any symptoms and is stable,” hospital authorities said.

Rao’s family visited him in hospital on Wednesday after arriving from Hyderabad and was appalled by his condition. They alleged that his bed and clothes were soiled. The family said he was unable to recognise his wife or his daughters.

“We have repeatedly approached police, Telangana, Maharashtra state governments, central government and even courts seeking Mr Varavara Rao’s release from prison on health grounds in view of the pandemic. Unfortunately our pleas were rejected. After coming to know that he tested positive for Covid-19, the entire family is in shock,” Rao’s son-in-law and professor at the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad, K Satyanarayana said.

Rao is lodged at Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai. This is the second time he was taken to hospital since the case was transferred to a city court. In February, Rao and the other accused in the Elgar Parishad case were moved from Yerwada jail in Pune to the Navi Mumbai prison.

Rao’s pleas for interim bail, citing his susceptibility to the virus due to his age and ailments, have twice been rejected by the special NIA court. Rao’s defence has told the court that he was suffering from several ailments including a corona artery disease and hypertension. His defence team added that they will inform the Bombay high court about his diagnosis on Friday when his bail plea comes up for hearing. The trial in the Elgar case is yet to begin, but Rao and others have been charged with conspiracy under the UAPA.

Earlier this month, Rao’s wife P Hemalatha (72) and daughters P Sahaja, P Anala and P Pavana had held an online press conference. They said they feared for his life due to his deteriorating health and the state’s negligence. The family was disturbed after Rao grew incoherent and seemingly hallucinated while speaking to them over the phone from Taloja jail. They said his co-accused and companion, Vernon Gonsalves, took the phone from him and informed them that Rao was unable to walk, use the toilet or brush his teeth on his own.

In tears, Rao’s nephew N Venugopal had said his uncle’s brain was being damaged due to lack of adequate care. “The state is trying to kill him. We are not even asking for bail right now. Our immediate demand is get him better medical care or leave him in the family’s care, family will join him in a better hospital... Please don’t kill him in jail,” he said.

HYDERABAD: A tiger, which had migrated from Tadoba tiger reserve in Maharashtra into Telangana, is moving around for two months in Asifabad and Kumarambheem, searching for a territory.

While the forest department officials, who have named the tiger Asifabad 2 (A2), are confident that the tiger will soon find a territory in the state’s Kawal tiger reserve, concerns are also being raised about the two-lane road at Mancherial and Maharashtra-Telangana border acting as a major obstacle for the big cat to enter Kawal tiger reserve.

“The male tiger A2 is not able to find a place to settle because the territories are occupied by other males. And unfortunately, it has not reached Kawal due to the Mancherial-Chandrapur road. It is not able to cross the road because of constant human activity and traffic. It will be moving until it finds a territory and once it reaches Kawal, it will have a lot of habitat available,” said a source close to the forest department.

The tiger entered Khagaznagar in the state during April by crossing the Pranahitha river.

While confirming that A2 is still on the move for territory, Adilabad divisional forest officer B Prabhakar said: “The tiger has still not reached Kawal. Our field officers are constantly monitoring its movement.”

When asked if the two-lane road is acting as an obstacle for tigers migrating into the state, Prabhakar said: “There is a proposal to make this inter-state road into a four lane and since it is in the tiger corridor, officials from National Tiger Conservation Authority have visited the place to draw up a plan to mitigate the problem in case the road is widened.”

Clearance has been given by Ministry of Environment and Forests for widening a 94.6-km-long stretch of road connecting Mancherial and Chandrapur in Maharashtra from two lanes to four lanes.

When people were calling for a lockdown in Vasco , we did not do it. Now that it has increased, we are going for a lockdown. This is an error of judgement,” Malik said.TOI on Thursday had pointed out how Sawant refused to lock down the port town—the epicentre of local transmission—despite his ministers, councillors and locals calling for it.“Mangor Hill is responsible for the spread today. If we had done a lockdown, things would have been different,” he said. But Malik also clarified that he does not take these decisions and “I cannot intervene in the day-to-day functioning of the government”.Malik also said the deaths taking place due to Covid cannot be simply classified as comorbid deaths and the government cannot wash its hands off.“If a cancer patient gets Covid and he is sent to the Covid hospital, he is treated with paracetamol tablets. This cannot continue. I have given clear instructions to the government to treat patients with comorbidities properly and not put them under a similar treatment like the other patients,” he told TOI.Malik said, in his review meeting with Sawant and health minister Vishwajit Rane, he also raised his concerns over the entire management of the pandemic in the tiniest state.“There was a problem with the quality of food being provided at Covid care centres. There was no proper system in place to supply essential commodities at Mangor Hill. In Covid hospital also, they were not clear about anything,” he said.TOI had highlighted how in the Covid care centres, patients were themselves cleaning the toilets and the waste was being piled with no one to clear it.“I enquired with them whether essential commodities are reaching micro and containment zones and if yes, then what was the reason for agitation at Mangor Hill and Zuari Nagar,” Malik said.He also asked whether the government had thought of any scheme for the daily labourers who are in the containment zone.Malik said he asked Sawant whether there is any proposal to close Verna industrial estate, which as TOI had pointed out was the new epicentre for the pandemic and the route for Covid transmission in the state. “Will it not be advisable to impose a lockdown,” he said.In his review meeting, which was also attended by chief secretary Parimal Rai and health secretary Nila Mohanan, Malik also took stock of the health infrastructure in the state and asked them why there was a delay in picking up Covid positive patients and transferring them to the Covid hospital or care centres.“I have also enquired whether the government has adequate number of doctors and paramedic staff and whether they have all the facilities like ICUs, ventilators, oxygen cylinders, anti-virus drugs approved by ICMR,” he said.The governor also enquired about the plasma therapy and the time taken for testing and sending the report.Malik also enquire about the number of Covid care centres in the state, their capacity and where they are located and said that each taluka should at least have one care centre.The governor also wanted to know the government’s plan on whether there was any new Covid hospital in the offing, if the current hospital was filled, and whether there were enough Covid ambulances and hearse vans and whether they were provided free of cost.Malik said he was not saying that the government is not doing good work. “Departments, doctors, health minister… everybody is working day and night, but there are certain other things which has to be taken care of and that I have suggested,” he said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77011226,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-143013,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/guv-sawant-must-get-covid-act-together-delhi-keeping-an-eye/articleshow/77008999.cms

Guddan also told interrogators he spoke to Vikas hours before the ganglord and his men murdered 8 policemen in Bikru village .

Police, meanwhile, said there were 18 licensed guns in Bikru village and firearms of 14 residents are being examined to confirm if they were used in the attack. Police procured call detail records of Guddan and Dubey an hour before the ambush in Bikru .

“Guddan has three gun licences, of which two are registered in his name and one in the name of his wife Kanchan, who is gram pradhan of Kudhwa village,” said a senior police officer, monitoring the investigation. Police officials found 1,000 cartridges were procured from two gun houses in Kanpur in a span of six months in violation of rules.

As per Arms Act rules, only 100 cartridges can be procured in a year for rifles and 25 for revolvers, across India. Additional superintendent of police, rural, Brajesh Srivastava said, “We are probing the number of cartridges procured by Guddan in last six months. Two owners of gun houses are under scanner. All three weapons of Guddan have been seized, sealed and sent for forensic examination.”

The examination, claimed authorities, went off smoothly barring isolated hiccups of negligible nature.

“No major issues were reported from anywhere as students, parents, officials and volunteers took extra care in holding the examination under strict vigil. On an average, at least 85% candidates have taken the test. While the turnout in Delhi and Mumbai were close to 50%, that of the UAE was 90%. There need not to be much worry about the slump in student participation in Delhi and Mumbai, considering the much serious Covid-19 situation prevalent there,” commissioner for entrance examination A Geetha told TOI.

The state government on Wednesday, after much discussions, had permitted three Covid-19 positive students —one from Kottayam and two from Alappuzha— to take the examination from the hospitals they were admitted to. However, by morning, the student from Kottayam decided not to attend the examination, but a fresh request came up from Pathanamthitta district. Arrangements were made for that candidate too. The student took the entrance testat Pathanathitta general hospital.

Sealed question paper packets of 20 booklets were handed over to the hospitals where the students took the examination under camera surveillance and nurses doubled up as invigilators. In sensitive places such as Poonthura, where the outbreak the disease has reached astronomical numbers in the last few weeks, special arrangements were made for students to appear for the test. PPE kit-wearing invigilators supervised the test.

The test was conducted braving demands for putting off the examination to a later date as the critics, students and their parents felt the conduct of the same in the thick of the pandemic spread might put in risk the health of over 1 lakh students and all those who are involved in the process.

Two students attended KEAM 2020-21 from Alappuzha medical college hospital. Of them, one returned to Alappuzha from Kuwait a few weeks ago to appear for KEAM 2020-21. But three days ago, he tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted to Alappuzha MCH.

The second student is undergoing treatment in Covid First Line Treatment Centre, (CFLTC) Kayamkulam. The students took the test in a specially-arranged room. MCH deputy superintendent A Abdul Salam and nursing officer Revamma made all the arrangements for the examination.

He was a resident of Sri Aurobindo Ashram in the Union territory and was admitted to Jipmer after he tested positive in the last week of June.Born in Ancona, Italy, Paolo emerged as a leading architect in Europe in the 1950s. He had a true passion for architectural interiors, design, theatre and painting Paolo visited India in his thirties and met Sri Aurobindo’s spiritual collaborator Mirra Alfassa, fondly revered as the Mother, just before the inauguration of Auroville in 1968. He played a crucial role in assisting French architect Roger Anger in designing the Matrimandir and later proposed elaborate designs for the 12 gardens surrounding Matrimandir. He also offered his advice on design aesthetics and development of the township.Paolo permanently settled in Puducherry in 2010 and continued his artwork.

HYDERABAD: At the top of its game in 2019, Hyderabad’s office space absorption dropped to zero between April and June of 2020, owing to the outbreak, show latest real estate reports. During the corresponding period last year, the city had netted about a million sft of business.

Covid also deferred proposed transactions of anywhere between 5 and 6 million square feet (sft) that were expected to materialise this time, said industry sources. “They have been deferred in the short-term as tenants are focused on cost savings and are re-evaluating space strategies,” a prominent realtor explained.

Among the worst hit was the co-working industry, with Knight Frank’s India Real Estate report released on Thursday, pegging the drop in absorption in this segment to 75% between January and June 2020, over same period last year.

“Impact of pandemic is evident with pre-commitment deals coming under pause mode.

There is delay in upcoming supply due to near-halt situation in construction activity . Mobilisation of labour and finance, adherence to Covid protocols and timely government approvals are likely to be challenges for developers,” said Samson Arthur, branch director of Knight Frank India, while maintaining that the city, despite the lows, was better positioned than most other metros, through lockdown. This was reiterated in another report by Cushman & Wakefield, which stated that Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai were most active leasing markets even through troubled times. According to its report, Mumbai, Delhi-NCR and Ahmedabad, on the other hand, faced a steep drop of 67.2%, 78.8% and 89.8% in office space absorption during January to June. “Though we expect leasing activity to remain sluggish in the short-term, Bengaluru and Hyderabad will be first ones to bounce back. Hyderabad is best positioned in terms of favourable real estate costs, talent pool availability and infrastructure,” said Veera Babu, MD of Cushman & Wakefield.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra cyber department has told Twitter India to inform it of any cyber security breach that may target Indians and prominent Indian handles.

Prominent international personalities’ handles, with millions of followers, tweeted a crypto currency scam, which asked users to send bitcoins , and the person tweeting would send back double the amount. Many users fell prey to the scam.

State cyber department superintendent of police Balsing Rajput said due to the scale of the attack, twitter disabled some features for few hours. Twitter support found the cause of the attack to be a social engineering attack. Accounts of some employees having access to internal tools were compromised, which led to hackers gaining control of prominent handles.

A department analysis found the hackers could try to gain access to prominent Indian twitter profiles similarly. It is likely that it can be used for malicious intent like spreading fake news and misinformation. “In times of pandemic, any such hacking can cause widespread rumours and lead to chaos. Citizens should be alert and not blindly trust any tweet,” said Rajput.

The department urged other social media platforms to be alert and inform it in case of a breach.

The directorate has put in place an integrated academic information management system (IAIMS), under which centralised admissions are possible. But, DHE officials, state that this is only one of the 34 modules to be implemented in colleges across the state under the system.

Once colleges begin the new academic year 2020-21, the IAIMS will help teachers share their course content online with students through this system and even internal tests can be held using it by the respective subject teacher in each college.

“Once students’ admissions are confirmed, they will get access to the system, where they can log in using their email IDs. Even parents will be able to access things like attendance of the student. The students’ library records will be available and teachers will be able to hold internal exams using it,” said DHE official Mahadev Gawas .

The IAIMS will be available to the government as well as aided institutions across Goa.

With DHE having received the applications for admissions online this year, entire student data will be available at the click of the mouse to the state government ensuring better planning and management. Faculty records too will be available online to DHE and colleges.

“Admissions is only one of the modules that we have started with in this pilot project. Once the academic year begins, teachers will be able to carry out their entire class and course management work through this system. Teachers can allot assignments online and students will be able to upload them on this system itself for the teacher to access,” said Gawas.

Covid-19 cases in Goa are on the rise, and realising that classroom teaching may be a distant dream, DHE has responded by implementing the IAIMS. DHE has already begun work to convert at least 40% of the syllabus to e-content before the academic year can begin.

KOLKATA: A day before the state board higher secondary results, the higher education department has instructed that admission to all UG courses (honours and general) in the state-funded higher education institutions in West Bengal for the 2020-2021 academic session will begin online from August 10 . The entire admission process will be online.

A higher education department official said colleges are concerned about the admission process since educational institutions will require a minimum number of staffers to visit the campuses and work in coordination to put the system online.

“Thus, we shall begin the admission process from August 10. This will give the colleges additional time to understand how the Covid crisis is progressing. Also, HS candidates will get their marksheets and certificates July 31 onwards, which is important before beginning the college applications,” the official pointed out.

The government has put in place the infrastructure required for the online admission system. After students submit the form and the application fee , the merit list will be published.

“Prospective students can’t be called for counselling or verification of documents during the process of admission. No physical presence will be required at the colleges or universities. All eligible applicants will be informed directly by the college authorities through a letter, e-mail or via telecommunication. Fees will have to be paid online or at designated banks, not physically at the colleges. The lists of eligible applicants will be handed over to the designated bank branches for verification during payment of fees. The banks will receive admission fees based on the merit list,” the official added.

The applicants will have to upload all the documents online. Verification of the documents will be done only when the students report for the classes in due course. Admissions may be cancelled if the documents are found not in conformity with the declaration in the forms submitted online. “Everyone has to abide by the Covid-19 protocol. Also, the vice-chancellors of all state-aided universities will take the necessary steps to ensure social-distancing norms and other rules set by the state are followed,” the official said.

Several private colleges in the state, like Shri Shikshayatan College , Scottish Church College, St Xavier’s College (autonomous), The Bhawanipur Education Society College and others, have set their criteria and already invited applications.

A state university VC said, “We are yet to hold the admissions committee meetings and syndicate meeting to determine the UG admission criteria.” He added that academic activities will be suspended for some time.

“We are worried about how to hold the entrance tests for subjects which require to test a candidate’s basic knowledge,” he added.

This doesn’t give a clear picture whether all devotees who visited Tirumala were Covid-19 negative. With a majority of cases being reported in the state being asymptomatic, it is difficult to identify and isolate suspects. Ideally, the TTD should consider suspending pilgrim worship for at least two weeks till the situation improves,” she told TOI.Temples Protection Movement convenor Chilkur Rangarajan too felt the TTD should suspend pilgrim worship for some time in view of the rising number of cases in recent days. “The TTD has made the best of arrangements for devotees as per Covid-19 norms.

Secunderabad: Following a sharp spike in Covid-19 positive cases, the Local Military Authority (LMA) has decided to close roads in Secunderabad military station area from July 18.

The roads in the military establishment of Bolarum and Trimulgherry will remain out of bounds for people for 11 days till July 28.

In an official release on Thursday, the LMA said: “Keeping in view of the heavy spread of Covid-19 coupled with concerns of safety of all defence personnel, families and civilians, we have sanctioned closure of the road in the military establishment of Bolarum and Trimulgherry. This order will be effective from 6 am on July 18 to 11 pm on July 28.”

The LMA said ambulances or emergency medical cases would be allowed through the road after proper checkings and verifications. It urged the citizens to “cooperate with the military authorities” to contain the spread of the pandemic . However, the defence authorities were not clear as to which road would be closed for 11 days in their official release. LMA has already closed some roads leading to Allahabad Gate, Wellington Road, Gough Road, near Safilguda railway station , Bolarum and Yapral. Civilian traffic is restricted for two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening. Residents are worried as they will have to take a detour of at least five to eight km to reach their houses or workplaces once the road is made out of bounds. It is estimated that nearly 50,000 commuters using the road would be hit from Saturday.

Several complaints on the road closures were made during ‘Meet your SCB vice- president’ programme. SCB vice-president J Rama Krishna said nearly 40 complaints were filed from residents of Yapral, Safilguda and surrounding areas on road closures and LMA curbs.

Meanwhile, Federation of North Eastern Colonies of Secunderabad has flayed LMA decision, saying this arbitrary decision would affect 15% of city population, which resides in northeastern parts. “Women, elderly and sick people will be the worst-hit,” it said.

The rapid antibody card will help study the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, with 100% sensitivity and 98% specificity. It has the advantages of being cost-effective, sensitive, and rapid. It also facilitates testing of a large number of samples at any level of clinical setting, public health centres and hospitals.

The RGCB also received licence for manufacturing two more products — viral transport media (VTM) kit and a viral RNA extraction kit. The other products of RGCB —antigen detection system, ELISA and PCR kits— are under various stages of approval from the regulatory authorities.

The VTM kit is suitable for collection, transportation, maintenance and long-term storage of viral specimens. It helps preserve the viability of viruses for up to 72 hours at refrigerated temperatures. The swabs have been designed ergonomically with a pre-moulded breakpoint on their shaft.

The RNA kit facilitates fast manual isolation of viral RNA from the swab. The process takes only 25 to 30 minutes to extract 95% yield of RNA. It also has the price advantage as it is manufactured using raw material available in India.

These products have been developed by RGCB in partnership with Sperogenx Biosciences Pvt Ltd, Bengaluru, and POCT Services, New Delhi, under SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic umbrella. Of these, VTM and RNA kits have already been test-marketed. Sperogenx is the development partner and POCT the commercial partner.

The RGCB, in collaboration with POCT, is developing the ELISA kit that can be produced at a low cost. This is affordable and easy-to-use, and can be done in a resource-limited setting for a serological assay in multiple analyses at a time.

The bench was hearing a petition filed by professor PL Vishweshwar Rao of Telangana Jana Samithi and Cheruku Sudhakar of Telangana Inti Party. While the PCB spoke about the approval it accorded for demolition, the SEIAA said that it did not accord any environment clearance for the secretariat project. “None of them has answered our query whether preparing the land can be described as the first step of the new project requiring prior EC,” judges said. Ministry of environment and forestry rules say that constructions that occupy a space of 20,000 square meters to 1.5 lakh square meters fall under purview of category-B projects and construction of a new secretariat comes under this category. “None of the cited judgments of NGT, high courts and SC has dealt with this preparation of land subject. Hence, we presume that this is the first case in the country raising important legal questions,” the judges said. “This is all the more the reason why we are expecting a honest assistance to court.”

Advocate General BS Prasad reiterated that what the government was doing now pertains to demolition and they had obtained permit from local authorities and PCB to deal with construction and demolition waste. “Since the question of raising a structure is not immediate concern, government need not obtain any permit for a new construction now,” AG argued. However, the judges asked assistant solicitor general N Rajeswara Rao to ascertain it from the MoEF by Friday.

HYDERABAD: A year after its launch, NRI Women Safety Cell has handled 101 petitions from victims whose husbands or in-laws are non resident Indians (NRIs). Despite the prevailing situation due to pandemic, the NRI cell has taken up a review of all the cases to ensure that there are no loose strings in investigation.

The NRI cell was inaugurated by DGP M Mahendar Reddy on July 17, 2019, at the office of IG women safety wing to focus on cases where NRI spouses or relatives are the prime accused. The NRI cell has been receiving petitions from the victims, mostly related to domestic and dowry harassment. The cell also receives information from police stations whenever a complaint is lodged by the victims against NRI husbands and in-laws. “The staff at the NRI cell follow specifically formed SOP. They collect information from the petitioner in a specific format and help them in the registration of the case. After the case is registered, NRI cell staff frequently reviews the status in presence of panel of experts and follows it up with both the complainant as well as the investigating officer,” DIG women safety wing, B Sumathi said.

The NRI cell in coordination with Regional Passport Office (RPO), National Commission for Women ( NCW ), ministry of external affairs (MEA), ministry of home affairs (MHA) and Telangana ’s general administration department (GAD) has managed to ensure that Look Out Circulars were issued against eight accused and in seven cases, passports of the offenders were deposited in courts.

Parents of a US based NRI were sentenced to two years imprisonment in a dowry harassment case of 2009 due to the efforts of NRI cell and the CID. After the registration of case, the accused did not come to India and NRI Cell ensured that LOC is maintained against the absconding accused and NBW is also pending against him, so that he could be arrested upon entry into the country.

271,['17/07/2020'],Revenue dept sets the ball rolling for dist reorganisation,"Amaravati: With the government set to reorganise the districts on the basis of Lok Sabha constituencies, the revenue department is gearing up to make field-level arrangements.

Following the decision, several districts will undergo complete socio-geographical and political changes. Districts such as Guntur, Krishna , East Godavari and West Godavari, which command a larger political clout, are likely to diminish in stature after the creation of new districts.

Although, the formation of new districts is likely to create hurdles in reaching the district headquarter town, the chief minister has set all apprehensions aside stating that people would get used to the new system once created. The chief minister is believed to have agreed to making Araku Lok Sabha constituency into two districts keeping in view the geographical disadvantages of the tribals.

“I have been advocating creation of smaller districts for long. I must thank chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy for taking a firm decision on the issue as smaller districts will take the governance to the door-steps of the people,” said MLC Dokka Manikyavaraprasad.

Analysts say that the creation of new districts along with providing administrative convenience to officials as well as people is likely to change political equations in many districts. The new districts are likely to end the dominance of upper-caste communities in many areas as it gives an opportunity to new leadership to emerge.

“It will also create new infrastructure like roads and transport connectivity to the district headquarter and help flourish real estate sector,” said an analyst.

The revenue department has carried out a study on creation of new districts soon after YSRC came to power. The department proposed to create a few new revenue divisions and new mandal headquarters before setting up the district headquarters. Sources said that the department is of the view that each district comprising seven assembly segments of Lok Sabha constituency should have at least two revenue divisions. The department had also suggested splitting bigger mandals into two or three smaller mandals.

“The creation of new revenue divisions and new mandals might easily allay the fears about district headquarter being situated far away,” said a senior official.

“Any additional delay in listing the matter, despite specific directions of the court to list the same will irreversibly prejudice the petitioner’s case and cause a loss to the public exchequer,” said Tagotra in the letter to the registrar.

But, most of the Kalari Sanghams in the state have not commenced training after lockdown kicked in.“We used to train around 200 students annually and at any given time, there used to be around 80 students. But following the lockdown, we have discontinued the classes as it is difficult to maintain social distancing while imparting the lessons,” Sudhakaran Gurukkal of CVN Kalari at Edakkad near Kozhikode, said.Gurukkal, who have been running the Kalari training centre from 1995 onwards, said the arrivals of foreign students this year had declined even some time before the lockdown. “We used to have around 12 foreign students here but this year the numbers were on a decline even before the Covid-19 outbreak,” he added.He said it takes up to six years for a student to master Kalari while foreign students have been undertaking intensive courses of two years duration for which they come in multiple three-month long visits.Sudhakaran Gurukkal said the Kalari treatments at the centres have also been hit following Covid-19 restrictions as treatments like Uzhichil (massage) involves body contact.“Karkkadakam month used to be the popular time for such treatments. But this year the authorities have advised against carrying out treatments involving body contact and we cannot do Uzhichil without contact,” he added.Gurukkal, who is the state president of the Kalaripayattu Federation of India, said though there are around 400 Kalari Sanghams in the state, main training centres accounted for just around 50.Rajan Gurukkal, who has been running the Dhanwanthari Kalari Sanghom at Kanayagode in Kozhikode, said he has informed his around 110 students in the two Kalaris that the classes would start only when the schools reopen after the Covid- 19 situation normalises. “We used to conduct classes over the three months from June and had classes during six days a week, but this season we have not commenced training,” he said.",kozhikode,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kalari-sanghams-fall-silent-in-the-face-of-invisible-enemy/articleshow/77007344.cms

Around 500 vials of Remdesivir, the only drug approved by the USFDA for Emergency Use Authorisation treatment of Covid-19 patients, have already reached the city hospitals.Industry sources said Tocilizumab is being supplied to institutions on a requirement basis. “Doctors are placing requirements with the hospitals, who, in turn, are placing orders with pharmaceutical companies. The medicine is being supplied directly to the hospitals through institutional stockists,” said Sajal Ganguly, president of the Bengal Chemist and Druggists Association.The hospitals are also maintaining a protocol where each vial is accounted for. They are also maintaining a record of consent by patients. According to Ganguly, however, there is no way the medicines will be supplied through normal distribution chain any time soon. “There is a demand for Remdesivir and Tocilizumab from across hospitals,” Ganguly added.“One has to keep in mind that few strongly advocated dataset are available to suggest when the drugs should be administered and at what dosage. There are reports in journals that suggest efficacy of Remdesivir, but they are too preliminary to suggest any definite efficacy,” said Jyotishka Pal, senior consultant, RTIICS.Tocilizumab has been found effective with timely administration to calm the “cytokine storm” caused by the immune system’s overreaction to coronavirus . “There has not been any randomized control trial for Tocilizumab.

283,['17/07/2020'],Fire at warehouse hits UAE expats,"Kochi: Scores of non-resident Keralites who left UAE in distress because of loss of jobs and concerns over the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus situation are in a terrible shock after they lost many valuables and household items in a warehouse fire in Dubai .

The valuables, bought using their savings during the course of expat life, include furniture, electronic gadgets, dresses, and articles of interior decor. The total losses suffered would amount to several crores.

The devastating fire occured at the Dubai warehouse of Ruby Cargo on July 6 but many who had booked shipments were allegedly kept in the dark by the company. An investigation by Dubai Police and civil defense is currently on.

“The incident happened on July 6 but was informed only after I called up the office of Ruby Cargo days later to know when it would be shipped. It was a huge shock. I got a formal email only on July 13,” says Santhosh Kumar, who took a repatriation flight to Kerala on June 30 after giving up his job as an artist in a daily newspaper.

Kumar, who had packed two jumbo boxes, with expensive electronic gadgets, says his losses would come to around Rs 20 lakh.

“I had also specifically asked them about the insurance but they dissuaded me,” says Kumar, who now suspects foul play as the company claimed total loss. Many expats decided to ship the furniture because there were no takers for such goods.

Jayanarayanan, a Palakkad native who lost goods worth around Rs 14 lakh, said he visited the site on July 9 along with a friend after they learned about the fire.

“There were not many charred remains at the site and many boxes like ours had utensils such as steel plates which would not burn easily,” says Jayanarayanan, who retired as a manager with a petroleum company after 14 years of work. Ruby Cargo returned 5,650 dirhams they had charged him for the shipment, but he is not sure whether others have been reimbursed too.

Vikraman S, a resident of Abu Dhabi, who shifted back to Varkala lost household equipment worth around Rs 20 lakh, believes that the fire was due to natural causes.

“I migrated to the UAE in the early eighties and have known the company ever since. I don’t think there is a reason to disbelieve them. It is unlikely that they would do such a thing when their business is booming,” he said. An email sent to Ruby Cargo officials seeking their version was not answered.

“There are people who lost their jobs during the pandemic and those who left their jobs and were planning to settle down in Kerala. As per my knowledge there are at least 80 people who have been affected and we are now trying to trace all of them,” says Santhosh Kumar, who has now formed a WhatsApp group to bring together people who have suffered losses and seek damages.

He was admitted to the trauma surgery department around 10pm and was to be shifted to the ward when he went missing from admission area. Later, the hospital staff found his body hanging in the bathroom. No suicide note was found.In the past 41 days, AIIMS has witnessed four deaths by suicide. This includes the death of a hospital doctor undergoing treatment for depression, a journalist admitted to the trauma centre for Covid-19, and another patient suspected of depression over a five-year-old ailment.While the hospital said it had increased security and CCTV monitoring to prevent such incidents, doctors said psycho-social support was needed too.“Getting admitted to a hospital for chronic or acute illness is known to cause anxiety. The Covid crisis has made it worse. Everyone, including healthcare workers, are very anxious and under stress. All this could be leading to such incidents,” said Dr Sudhir Gupta, professor and head of forensic sciences at AIIMS.Gupta’s department is planning to conduct a study of the reasons behind the spate of suicides during the Covid outbreak. Apart from AIIMS, increased rate of suicide has also been reported among patients in other hospitals across the country.AIIMS said the department of psychiatry had started a tele-counselling service for all Covid-19 patients at the hospital. “Additionally, 15 residents from the psychiatry department are being deployed daily in the Covid wards for screening patients for mental health issues and counselling, if needed,” said a senior official.Dr Rajesh Sagar, professor of psychiatry at AIIMS, said early identification of people with known or underlying mental health illnesses was one of the ways to reduce deaths by suicide. “We also need to take care of social disintegration caused due to the Covid outbreak,” he added.Recently, TOI had reported how the doctor’s touch, which was most reassuring for a patient, had gone missing due to distance being maintained because of the Covid scare. This, psychiatrists pointed out, could exacerbate distress and anxiety among the ill. In the case of Covid-19 patients, this could lead to a feeling of neglect, Sagar pointed out.Unlike a normal hospital ward, where adjacent beds are kept closer, the Covid protocol mandates a minimum distance of one metre between adjacent beds. Also, all patients have to wear a triple-layer surgical mask at all times.“Those with existing mental health issues like depression are most vulnerable. Elderly people living in loneliness and isolation might also get extreme suicidal thoughts. For example, I have a stable job and regular income, but because of the Covid crisis I’m unable to do surgeries. This has been leading to frustration,” said a senior doctor, who did not want to be quoted.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77009881,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-345925,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/spate-of-deaths-by-suicide-at-aiims-cause-for-concern/articleshow/77008188.cms

The mining companies and the dependants, including the state government, are hoping for commencement of iron ore extraction in the state to boost the economy. The Goa mining matter was expected to be taken up by the court on July 16.

Advocate general Devidas Pangam said that the matter is likely to come up in this month itself. “There is a possibility that both mining matters, including the state government review petition against the apex court order of February 2018 may be clubbed together,” Pangam said

The last hearing was scheduled on April 21, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic , the matter could not be taken up.

Two mining companies have approached the apex court for extension of mining leases till 2037. The companies had filed a special leave petition (SLP) after the high court of Bombay at Goa had dismissed their petitions challenging the Goa, Daman and Diu ( Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987.

During the Portuguese era, the appellants were granted mining concessions which were converted into mining leases under the abolition act. The SLP stated the abolition act should be made application from 1987 instead of 1961.

Mining in Goa came to an halt in March 15, 2018 following the Supreme Court decision to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases.

The state government before the apex court had said that the companies had made a representation to the mines department contending that under the amendment to Section 8A of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, they are entitled to extend their mining leases up to 2037.

He also alleged that the government is attacking TDP leaders and cadre psychologically, financially and physically, apart from threatening them with false cases for raising their voice against it. Vijayawada MP Kesineni Nani said the ruling party is undermining the voice of the opposition in a democratic polity through extra-legal measures, which is in violation of the constitutional provisions.

Later, the MPs met Union rural development minister Narendra Singh Thomar and lodged a complaint that the state government is not releasing NREGS funds to the agencies even a year after the Centre released the same.

This has resulted in drop in sale of paan by almost 60% to 65% after the lockdown. Nikhil Sharma, who used to eat pan every day says, “Paan is like a meal for me. Before lockdown, I never imagined my days without it, but ever since the lockdown has been imposed, I have stopped eating paan. My family members and friends have told me that it could land me in trouble if I eat paan during the ongoing situation.” Vikas Gupta, a businessman said, “I have been eating paan for almost 35 years. I had never thought of a day without having paan before the lockdown. Earlier, I could not eat as shops were closed. Later, my craving subsided.”Paan shopkeepers claimed that the sale has dropped drastically. “Who will eat paan in such a situation? I have even stopped buying paan from dealers. My sale has gone down by almost 70%,” said Pramod Sahu, a shopkeeper in Kolar locality. When asked the reason for such a drastic decline in sale, he said, “Spitting has been strictly banned by BMC. Several of my customers who used to come earlier were fined as they were found spitting paan. This is good for the citizens due to which people have voluntarily stopped eating paan.”Another shop owner from Arera Colony area, Anurag Yadav said, “Major impact has been on masala paan which people do not swallow after eating. Even the availability in the wholesale market is low.” In the fight against Covid , last month, the Bhopal Municipal Corporation had launched a drive to impose fines on those found spitting. On an average, fines of Rs30,000 to Rs70,000 are being collected by the civic body daily.Fine for spitting in public is Rs1,000.

292,['17/07/2020'],Poor connectivity worries Cusat students from Kashmir,"KOCHI: Even as Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) on Tuesday announced the postponement of online semester examinations for BTech and other part-time courses following social-media outrage, students from Kashmir and Ladakh regions are not certain of being able to take the tests when new dates are announced.

For the nearly 25 students, pursuing various BTech courses at the university, from Kashmir and Ladakh, internet connectivity back home is poor at best, and that too when it is not shut down which is the case on most days.

These students have hardly attended online sessions due to the connectivity issues and are now worried about attending the online exam, which requires them to be live on video conference for two hours to viva voce and upload answer sheets.

Ather Hussain, a sixth semester BTech computer science student and native of Baramulla in Kashmir, has been travelling around 20km to neighbouring Bandipora district on most days over the last two months for uninterrupted internet connectivity.

His village is just 40km from the Indo-Pak border and most days the area witnesses complete internet shutdown. He has to make do with a 2G connection, as government has suspended high-speed internet in Kashmir, but that allows him to download videos and PDF files provided by the varsity.

Stanzin Phandy, another BTech student and resident of Ladakh, has hardly attended online sessions due to the frequent shutdowns. The border clash with China has only made matters worse.

Moreover, most of the villages in Kashmir have been declared Covid-19 hotspots, making travel riskier. These students had left for home before the Janata Curfew on March 22 and most had to leave study materials behind.

“It takes more than 30 minutes to download a 10MB video and I missed most of the online classes due to the internet shutdown. How am I supposed to write the online exam in this situation? When I tried to apprise my teachers about the situation, they asked me to move to a place where connectivity is strong. Even if the exams are postponed, it won’t make any difference for us unless we can get back to Kochi , which is not going to happen for a while. If we miss the exam it will affect our placement opportunities,” said Ather.

Students had staged online campaigns demanding cancellation of the online exams citing uncovered portions and the short notice for exams. The Twitter hashtag #cusatexam saw more than 500,000 posts and comments.

The varsity, however, cited the spike in Covid-19 cases for the postponement and said new dates will be announced shortly. It said exams cannot be cancelled as most students want them to be completed soon.

“We have postponed the exams but cancelling them is not an option as more than 90% students support their conduct online. More than 90% of portions were completed before the lockdown. The concerns of the students from Kashmir and Ladakh are genuine and we will give them a chance to write the exams later. It is being discussed by the governing body,” a Cusat official said.

295,['17/07/2020'],Goa govt caps traffic sentinel’s returns,"PANAJI: Government has decided to re-introduce traffic sentinel scheme in a revised format starting January 1, 2021. It was approved in the cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

Till the revised scheme comes into effect, the existing scheme has been kept in abeyance with immediate effect.

An official said it has been decided to keep the scheme on hold till the end of the year as it was felt that the substantial financial liability incurred in the implementation of the scheme would affect its self-sustainability in the pandemic situation.

It was introduced in November 2017 to reduce traffic violations with active participation of people and to create traffic sense amongst various sections of road users through community policing. It also aimed to persecute traffic violators through violations reported on sentinel app by enrolled traffic sentinels. Though introduced with a noble motive, it became a source of controversy with complaints pouring in about mischief by some sentinels, and people being persecuted for minor violations. There was growing demand that it be dropped completely.

The official said they decided to revise it since it was noticed that for some of the sentinels it turned out to be a means of earnings with them accumulating points entailing substantial amounts to sentinels.

“The scheme has been revised by capping the number of points to be accumulated by any sentinel and to reduce the weightage of the points for reporting different types of traffic violations,” he said.

Accordingly, under the changed scheme, points awarded to various traffic violations to be reported by sentinels have been reduced.

Reporting traffic violations for which a sentinel can get reward points are driving against the flow of traffic, parking on footpath or zebra crossing , triple riding, improper number plate, driving without seat belt, riding without helmet, using vehicle with tinted glasses, using phone while riding or driving, red light jumping and dangerous driving.

“There should be an investigation into the exchange of communication within the government. The government was only concerned about coal and iron ore transportation and not at all about the lives of the people,” Sardesai told reporters.

He also came down heavily on the government for dismissing covid deaths to comorbid conditions of the patient.

The Fatorda MLA also questioned the wisdom of the government in having a three-day lockdown when the incubation period of the virus was itself 14 days. Terming the decision “a thoughtless gimmick,” Sardesai said the lockdown was nothing but “politics over essential commodities.”

He also advised the chief minister to get himself tested for Covid-19 as a policeman deployed in his office has tested positive.

He also underscored the need for bringing in a contract farming law in the state with a view to bringing barren land into cultivation.

VADODARA: A sessions court rejected bail plea of rape accused Dr Prashant Upadhyay, priest of Shri Baglamukhi Brahmastra Vidya Mandir. He is accused of raping a married woman in March.

Upadhyay, who had first come under scanner for cheating his follower, had filed a bail application on July 4 as his custodial interrogation would not be necessary since the chargesheet in the case has already been submitted in the court.

Upadhyay also said that the physical relationship with the 28-year-old complainant was consensual and for three years she did not approach police against him. The bail was, however, opposed by police through an affidavit which was upheld by the court of additional sessions judge H G Pandya . “The accused has done a shameful act as the complainant used to look up to him as a ‘guru’ and had gone to him to share her household issues. The court also considered the argument that in the past a case of cheating and assault was also registered against him,” said district government pleader Anil Desai.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

However, there’s no official word on the PM’s visit.

The Covid-19 pandemic has spurred Trust members to seek an early ‘bhoomi pujan’ (foundation-laying ceremony) and this was reiterated in a letter to the prime minister by Trust chairman Mahant Nritya Gopal Das this week. A tentative Ayodhya itinerary of PM Modi between July-end and August first week is being hammered out, though a digital inauguration is not completely ruled out, sources in the Temple Trust told TOI on Thursday.

On Thursday, PM Modi’s aide Nripendra Mishra, former security in charge of PM and current security advisor to Ramjanmabhoomi, K K Sharma met Temple Trust members, including Anil Mishra, former royal Bimlendra Mishra and Trust secretary Champat Rai . District officials, including the DM and SSP were also present.

Talking to TOI, Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, official spokesman of Trust president Nritya Gopal Das, said, “The mahant had written to the PM, inviting him to conduct the bhoomi pujan the sanctum sanctorum at the earliest.” Talking to TOI, BJP MLA from Ayodhya, Ved Prakash Gupta , said, “Efforts are on to bring the prime minister to Ayodhya to lay the adhaar shila (foundation) of Ram temple. The PM’s visit and the Ram temple will change Ayodhya’s destiny and turn the temple town to India’s Vatican.”

BHOPAL: State Congress president Kamal Nath on Thursday constituted a seven-member team to probe the incident which led to the alleged suicide attempt by a Dalit couple during an anti-encroachment drive on the outskirts of Guna on Tuesday. The committee will go to Guna on Saturday and later submit its report to him.

Ahead of the state assembly bypolls, the Guna incident has grabbed considerable political attention from Bhopal to New Delhi. Former AICC president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday tweeted a video showing police excesses during the eviction process. He said, “Our fight is against this mentality and injustice.”

Here in the state capital, Nath constituted the seven-member probe committee, which includes former home minister Bala Bachchan, Jaivardhan Singh , Dalit leader Phool Singh Baraiyya, PCC working president Surendra Choudhary , Manawar MLA Dr Hiralal Alawa and former Bhopal mayor Vibha Patel.

State Congress on Thursday took to Twitter and said, “Our party has always supported the poor and marginalised farmers in their daily struggle. This inhuman act of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government has exposed its dictatorial streak. This fight will be the beginning of the end of Shivraj’s government.”

Congress party in New Delhi also took to Twitter and said, “It’s not a coincidence that BJP-ruled states top the charts in crimes against SC/STs across the country. The anti-poor and anti-minority mindsets are an intrinsic part of their hate-filled ideology.” Congress said in 2018, there were 11,924 incidents of atrocities against Dalits in UP, 7,061 in Bihar and 4,753 in MP.

KOLKATA: The state government is setting up more safe homes for asymptomatic Covid patients who do not require hospital care.

On Thursday, it was decided that Gitanjali Stadium at Kasba and Kishore Bharati Stadium at Santoshpur would be turned into safe homes to be run by the government.

With the number of cases rising, private hospitals are running out of beds. The bed occupancy in government facilities across the city is also on the rise with pressure on hospitals like Medical College Kolkata.

“There are many patients who do not need to be admitted in hospitals. But they do not have proper home isolation facilities and cannot afford the satellite health facilities run by private hospitals. These safe homes are meant for them,” said a source at the health department.

The responsibility of setting up the safe home at Gitanjali Stadium has been given to the KMDA while the state PWD will take care of the other home at Kishore Baharati Stadium . The government healthcare workers like nurses will be posted at the safe homes where doctors will visit regularly to check the patients. If they feel at any moment that any patient needs hospitalisation, arrangement will be made. Patients can also have home-cooked food to be delivered by family members, if they want.

With the two at Gitanjali Stadium and Kishore Baharati Stadium, the city will have five safe homes. The third home at Anandapur was inaugurated by Firhad Hakim three days ago while the other two homes are located at Tangra and New Town. Sources said the government might convert a few more stadiums and sports complexes into safe homes. Currently, the state has got 106 safe homes across the state.

Kolkata has 4,512 active cases — higher than any other district. Out of the 1690 fresh cases on Thursday, 496 were from the city.

The DHE had received applications from 10,735 students across the general stream programmes for the 30-odd colleges in Goa.

The flood of applications even surprised the officials as this is the first time Goa is holding centralised admission process to general stream colleges.

Around 15,000 students have cleared the Class XII state board exams this year and another 1,000 from central boards. Every year, less than 13,000 students apply to general stream colleges in the state.

This means that the largest bulk has already submitted their applications through the new online process.

BHOPAL: BJP rejected Congress’s allegations of ‘jungle raj’ in Madhya Pradesh and said that as soon as the government came to know about the Guna incident , the district collector, SP and IGP were removed.

BJP Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia, who was a four-time Lok Sabha member from Guna, took cognizance of the incident and said it was very serious. He said he spoke to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday.

“The incident in Guna is very unfortunate. I spoke to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and requested him to take stringent action against the insensible policemen. The chief minister has ordered the removal of the officials responsible in the case with immediate effect,” tweeted Scindia.

Scindia said, “The Guna SP and district collector have been removed, and inquiry has been sought into the incident. I am confident that action will be taken against all those who are responsible for the heinous act.”

Home minister Narottam Mishra also rejected Rahul Gandhi’s allegations and said that during the erstwhile Congress government, criminals were never caught, but given protection.

“When it was Rahul Gandhi’s government in Madhya Pradesh, officers were posted under a prepaid system. Congress government miserably failed, which was highlighted by the kidnapping and murder of twins in Satna district. In Guna, as soon as we got to know of the incident, the district collector, SP and IG were removed,” said Mishra, when asked about Rahul’s tweet on the Guna incident.

A Dalit couple consumed poison after they were allegedly manhandled by cops during an anti-encroachment drive in Guna district , on Tuesday. The state government has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident. However, Congress and BJP were involved in war of words after the incident.

On Congress’s allegations, Mishra said, “In Madhya Pradesh, we have rule of law. People who don’t abide by the law will be sent to jail. During the previous Kamal Nath-led Congress government, criminals were never caught and were given protection. Now, we take immediate action and even big officers are also not spared.”

Meanwhile, around 20 people from the market tested positive for Covid-19 leading medical staff to conduct a swab test for 300 people who had contacted the traders and vendors. Meanwhile, officials have also decided to take test for another 300 people who had visited the market. Among them 200 people were screened today.

District collector M Govinda Rao inspected the market and the surrounding areas after instructing authorities to close down the area. Thanjavur district recorded 738 Covid-19 positive cases as on Tuesday. Of them, a considerable number of cases have emerged from Kumbakonam and its surrounding areas.

Since Anaikkarai and Neelathanallur were the main entry point of the district, almost all the people who returned from various parts of the state, particularly from Chennai, take these routes to reach Kumbakonam by road. The first Covid-19 case was registered from Kumbakonam in the district. Many people escape the check-posts and sneak into the town without screening, sources said.

Darasuram vegetable market located in Kumbakonam is the biggest markets in the central region next to Gandhi Market in Trichy . Around 900 shops are there and it handles around 300 tonnes of vegetables every day, sources said.

Despite the efforts by the officials and police, traders, shop keepers and customers often flout social distancing norms. Moreover, the influx of Chennai returnees also added to the woes.

District collector said that after three people from the market tested positive a few days ago, health officials screened 300 people. Of them, 20 tested positive. Their contact list has been prepared and 300 more people will also be tested, he said.

“Out of the 738 positive cases, 129 are from Kumbakonam. So, officials are asked to enforce the standard norms among the general public as well as among the traders to combat the virus,” he added.

The collector also ordered to shut two Tasmac outlets functioning near the market area.

Meanwhile, traders have proposed a week-long total lockdown in Kumbakonam to contain the virus. At a meeting on Wednesday, the functionaries of traders’ associations have decided to go for a full lockdown and also conveyed their decision to the commissioner of Kumbakonam municipality S Lakhsmi. Traders told her to enforce the lockdown for a week from July 19 assuring their full cooperation.

While the first tranche will have to be paid within the due date, which has been extended by 10 days, the rest have to be paid alongside the payments for July and August.

“The bill for June has been unusually high due to the addition of the arrears from the consumption in April and May, and in some instances, even March. We recognize the problem that many are facing in coughing up the amount and have decided to offer customers an installment scheme,” said CESC managing director (distribution) Debasish Banerjee.

The announcement came on a day when state power minister Sovondeb Chattapadhyay declared he had received a bill for Rs 11,000. On inquiring, CESC vice-president (distribution) Avijit Ghosh explained that since meter reading had not taken place between March 24 and June 7, provisional bills were raised on the basis of average consumption of the previous six months.

Initially, CESE had billed consumers whose meter had not been read in March according to the March 2019 bill. But, subsequently, CESC said the electricity regulator asked it to compute the bill according to the previous six months’ average consumption.

“Since there were winter months, the provision bills were low. So when the meter was read in June or July, it contained the units that had been consumed in the previous two or three months but had not been billed then,” an official explained.

LUCKNOW: Online learning may appear to be the only option in corona times, but long screentime and sitting before devices would result in permanent headache and health problems would arise if this continues for long, said high-scorers of CBSE class X exams.

TOI spoke to several school toppers in the city who scored 96% and above.

“Coaching and classes, both in online mode, are taxing for health. There is no option due to the pandemic, but if the present schedule continues persistent headache will become part of life,” said Mayank Agarwal of Montfort Inter College.

Another school topper Priyanshi Agrawal of Central Academy said, “Technical glitches play the villain during online classes. It can be beneficial if recorded lectures are provided to students with proper specifications so that no one misses anything.”

Sharing same views, Samridhi Chaurasiya of Red Rose Senior Secondary School said, “Long online classes are causing pain and swelling in eyes which are glued to the screen for five-six hours continuously. Eye dryness, irritation and health issues like back pain take the front seat during online classes.”

Anjaneya Raj Garg of Study Hall said, “This online learning has disturbed our healthy schedule and we are having a sedentary lifestyle due to it which is not good for us at this age in our growing years.” Shivakant Tiwari of Central Academy, Vikas Nagar, also expressed concerns about adverse impact on eyes and other health issues.

Krashika Singh of Amity International School and Sanya Lakhanpal of Delhi Public School, Shaheed Path , said regular breaks and classes on alternate days would be a good solution as it will provide relief for eyes and freedom from bad posture as well.

Supriya Raghuvansh, student of Delhi Public School, Eldeco, said, “I used to get tired of studies before lockdown and wanted to use my phone, but now I am tired of using my phone and don’t feel like even looking at it. Parents of most of my classmates are concerned about our long screentime and its bad effect on our health.” Similar sentiments were shared by Yashasvi Chaudhari of Lucknow Public School , Southcity and Bhavya Manchanda of Delhi Public School, Indira Nagar.

“Students living in remote areas do not have proper connectivity and struggle during online class. Noise and other distractions in homes make it tough for us to concentrate during class,” said Nirbheeka of Millennium School.

Harshit Kandpal, student of Army Public School, said, “Online classes are the only option right now, besides we save the time we used to spend travelling every day. The classes can be better if each student is asked to switch on the cameras.”

“Every student should be asked some questions to make the class interactive,” said Priyanshi.

State board secretary Ashok Bhosale told TOI: “From this year, the difficulty level of questions has changed. We have high, medium and low difficulty levels segregated across a question paper. Plus, the type of questions include objective, descriptive, multiple choice and those that judge a student’s skills. The changes have been made to match the syllabus and style of competitive exams.” He said the revised pattern added 25% objective type, multiple choice questions. This year on, students also got marks and not grades for EVS, taking their grand total to 650 from 600. The HSC syllabus is due to be revamped next year.As Mumbai further slipped to the last on the list of divisions, board officials blamed the high number of candidates and improved vigilance during exams.“We have the least instances of malpractice, which ensures every student writes the exams in the fairest manner. Additionally, the size of the division is the largest and the performance gets weighed down by a high number of repeaters too,” said Sandeep Sangave, secretary of the board’s Mumbai division.Among fresh candidates in Mumbai, the success rate was 89.4%, up from last year’s 83.9%. For repeat candidates, success rate was as low as 42.9% though.The Konkan division, which was at the top of the table with a success rate of 94.7%, had 30,143 candidates while the Mumbai division had 3.1 lakh.Most colleges across the city reported improved results with not only more students scoring above 90% but also reporting a better top score . For instance, at N M College of Commerce, Vile Parle, the number of 90% and above scorers rose to 384 from 363 last year. Shobhana Vasudevan, principal of R A Podar College, Matunga, said their results have improved too.While the board doesn’t announce a merit list, the highest score in Mumbai TOI could trace on Thursday was 98.8% in commerce—higher than last year’s 97.2%. High scores across streams saw a jump but stayed lower than the near-perfect results of ISC and CBSE toppers.Meanwhile, continuing the trend, in Mumbai, the success rate for girls was 85.7%, almost 9.6% higher than boys.While the board conducted all HSC exams before the Covid lockdown, evaluation was hit. The board had to find ways to reach out to teachers living in Covid red zones, collect answer sheets from post offices during the lockdown and from districts like Nandurbar and Chandrapur. Many teachers were unable to submit answer sheets. State board chairperson Shakuntala Kale said, “Our divisional secretaries and board employees travelled to remote locations to ensure answer sheets were collected from every assessor.”(With inputs from SwatiShinde Gole & Ardhra Nair)",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77009830,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-525240,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/revised-paper-pattern-lifts-hsc-score-to-5-yr-high/articleshow/77008413.cms

Joshi, in a letter on July 15, has sought information from Mundhe why the civic administration has not implemented the rulings including suspension of deputy chief medical officer Dr Praveen Gantawar and his wife Dr Shilu, a doctor practising in NMC-run Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya.

The mayor had issued nine rulings including directing the administration to approach the state government to withdraw an FIR registered against Congress corporator Nitin Sathawane, formation of standing committee chairman-led committee to inquire into the allegations of violations in renovation and converting five NMC-run hospitals into Covid care centres.

Joshi had also constituted a one-member chief engineer’s committee to inquire into frequent repairs of chambers and money spent under this head. The committee was supposed to complete the inquiry and table its report within 15 days.

Taking note of objections raised by many corporators, the mayor had also sought report on promotion of Pramod Hiwase from driver to municipal commissioner’s personal assistant. The letter pointed out that chief medical officer Dr Sawai failed to obey mayor’s instructions to investigate one NMC doctor from Jafri Hospital who was facing charges of issuing medical certificates in lieu of money.

The chief accounts and finance department too failed to take disciplinary action against an official who had allegedly kept pending a file pertaining to LED lights for 135 days.

The administration could not reply as to why it had bypassed and did not share information about the status of development works with the standing committee. It also failed to submit its say on municipal commissioner Mundhe and an additional municipal commissioner availing leave without the nod of standing committee by July 6, the letter stated.

Mundhe was not available for comments though on June 26 he had told TOI that he would not implement the mayor’s rulings terming them illegal.

A senior NMC official admitted the delay and said it was on account of yet-to-be-prepared minutes of the marathon GB meeting.

313,['17/07/2020'],"General infections down, thanks to less eating out and indoor lifestyle","Nagpur: Precautions taken by people and forced confinement at homes has brought down the number of general infections and illnesses in the city. Doctors say shunning outside food and indoor lifestyle has led to a drop in stomach infections like cholera, typhoid, gastro enteritis, diarrhoea, viral hepatitis A, viral hepatitis B, food poisoning, cough, and cold.

The cases have remained near-zero not just during the last three months but even after the onset of the rainy season.

As per Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) health department epidemic report for 34 infectious diseases, just four cases, two each of AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) and measles, were reported from April to June this year.

Against this, the department had recorded 418 cases during April to June in 2019. Another major reason for the drop in infectious diseases is access to clean source of water. As per the report, water samples collected to investigate sources of infection were found to be less contaminated this year.

Just 2.9% out of 990 water samples were contaminated in April, followed by 2.3% in May and 2.6% for 1,000 samples in June. The ratio was 9.90%, 9.41% and 10.08% respectively during 2019. The contamination rate was higher even for fewer samples collected last year.

The data has been gathered from all government and private hospitals within municipal limits. Based on the data collected, the report is prepared from April to March each year. Officials said the pattern is likely to be the same for July, while it may show a similar graph like previous year if people throw caution to the winds as lockdown is lifted.

Dr Ramesh Mundle, who is professor of medicine at Lata Mangeshkar Medical Hospital, said people have become more hygiene-oriented which has led to them falling sick fewer times. “Besides this, roadside food is not available so people are eating at home, washing vegetables properly and maintaining good personal hygiene. This is a good achievement during lockdown,” he said

Dr Mundle said last year OPDs would remain full with complaints of dehydration and stomach infections.

OCHRI director Dr Anup Marar too said that lesser eating out and lifestyle changes have brought down general infection rate.

But the determined teenager, who has stood second in her residential school Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya ( JNV ), Canacona, said she had expected to do better.

Vaibhavi, also a table tennis player who has represented Goa at the nationals, now has her sights set on cracking the IIT JEE. After clearing a test, she has already been selected by Dakshina Foundation for free coaching to crack the IIT JEE , no small feat for a girl from a hamlet so remote, that it is virtually unknown.

Once the travel restrictions ease, Vaibhavi will be traveling to Hyderabad to train over two years, simultaneous to her higher secondary education at a JNV near the city.

“I was studying at a government school in Kurdi, Sanguem, when my uncle’s daughter, who was already at JNV Canacona, told my parents that joining there will help my academics. I answered a test and got through and joined the residential school from Class VI. In Class X, after school hours, I had four to five hours for self-study and I put in my best efforts,” said Vaibhavi, the second of four siblings.

Though of a tender age when she joined the residential school, away from her family, in another taluka, Vaibhavi said she received the right support from her teachers and exposure to sports too here.

“Our teachers were very good. I could easily understand what they were teaching in class. My friends at the hostel and our housemistress were a great support,” said the teenager, who has a score of 473 out of 500 at the Class X exams.

From JNV, Canacona, 77 students appeared for the Class X exam and all cleared it, with 38 scoring distinction and 66 a first class, said school principal Animesh Pal.

“The school’s average score was 74.6%. Shivam U Mahto was the school topper with 95.8%. Another student Param Jadhav scored 93%. As per Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti’s police, more than 75% of our children come from rural areas. They are very sincere and maintained continuity in their study,” said the principal.

Till the time Vaibhavi can travel to Hyderabad, online coaching has already begun for her. She said she is struggling on account of poor internet connectivity in her village.

While Vaibhavi is focused on her engineering dream, her mother Lata said, “We have full faith in her abilities. She can be anything she wants, she has our full support. We just want her to, and we know she will, achieve great things and put our small village on the map.”

The meeting, originally scheduled to be held in Washington in April this year but postponed due to the pandemic, is expected to focus on natural gas and India's expanding market for the clean-burning fuel.India had in February 2018 elevated the India-US Energy Dialogue to a Strategic Energy Partnership (SEP). The SEP was formally announced during the visit of Prime minister Narendra Modi to the US in June 2017. The first ministerial meeting was held in New Delhi on April 17, 2018 between Pradhan and the then US energy secretary Rick Perry . A joint gas task force (GTF) was also set up under the umbrella of the energy partnership.The partnership was established to develop innovative policy recommendations for New Delhi to bolster the government's vision for natural gas in India's economy and seeks to advance the strategic and economic interests of both countries. The GTF had identified three areas that need to be addressed to expand gas use in India and trade with the US. These are, pricing -- markets and regulation, strengthening of gas infrastructure and stimulating natural gas demand growth.Pradhan chaired an industry-level interaction organized by the partnership on Tuesday ahead of the official talks. During the interaction, he invited US companies and investors to engage with India and invest in new opportunities in the country.He said that there have been a few collaborative efforts between Indian and American companies in this sector but it is far below the potential.

With the government having decided against opening pre-schools , owners of these institutions including those that are within the umbrella of major franchises, are looking for a way to cut their losses.Many such owners are contemplating renting the buildings that the schools are operating out of, with the chances of admissions resuming for the 2020-21 academic year growing increasingly dim with each passing day. Consequently, many establishments have decided to shut the schools till the start of the next academic year. Many owners are renting their buildings and the premises for various purposes, with many of them turning into temporary stockyards.A pre-school owner in Mysuru said that he was willing to offer the space to tenants who wished to use it for a limited period. “I am hopeful of the situation improving for the better by 2021,” he added.Girish Baga, who is associated with management of a pre-school chain in Mysuru, was less optimistic in his estimation. He opined that nearly 80% of the pre-schools that would shut owing to lack of admissions this year were unlikely to reopen. “Many pre-schools are run by homemakers, who run them out of small rented houses or small buildings. The situation being as grim as it is, many owners are finding it hard to pay rent for these structures,” Baga said.Officials in the department of public instruction (DPI), however, said that they had no information pertaining to these developments since pre-schools were not registered with the government.Mysuru district convener of the Karnataka Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools Santosh Kumar admitted that keeping pre-schools running in the current financial scenario had become an unviable proposition.The association general secretary D Shashi Lumar said that, among the hundreds of pre-schools that had been forced to shut shop were those that were part of very reputed franchises. “But many owners are exploring various business opportunities to remain afloat till the situation returns to normal,” he said.",mysuru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77008454,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-101642,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/running-pre-schools-turns-an-unviable-proposition-for-owners/articleshow/77008456.cms

VADODARA: A person claiming to be an army man was detained and his friend was booked for getting into a brawl with policemen in Chhota Udepur town on Thursday morning.

The accused Anish Rathwa and his pillion rider friend Chhagan Rathwa were stopped at a police point as Chhagan was not wearing a facemask. The cops asked Anish to show his driving license and his bike’s registration card and also asked Chhagan the reason for not wearing mask. On hearing the policemen, Anish lost his cool, identified himself as an army man and refused to show any documents.

Anish instead questioned the cops and then held collars of one of them. As police too retaliated, Chhagan also got into scuffle with one of them. Police claimed that the duo tore the buttons of their shirts. When Anish was being pushed in the police car, Chhagan managed to escape from there. It took three cops to make Anish sit in the car as he fought back with all his might and also hurled abuses at them.

An offence of assault, hurting a public servant, deterring a public servant from performing duties and violation of public notification was registered against the duo. “We are trying to verify if the accused is really from the Army as we did not find any identity card on him. We are also searching for his accomplice,” said a police official.

It has also come to fore Shaikh had already arranged for the poison from Cotton Market and kept it with him, showing he had planned the drastic act. The empty poison bottle was found near the drum in which Alwina’s body was found.

After killing Alwina, Shaikh had also consumed poison but it did not have any effect on him. He is learnt to have headed towards a well to end his life. He had left his two-wheeler’s key, shoes and pair of spectacles on the edge of the well before trying to take a plunge. Unable to muster courage, Shaikh tried to find other ways to end his life.

Of the 1.63 lakh students who appeared for the exam, 1.44 lakh cleared it in the Aurangabad division, which has jurisdiction over Aurangabad, Beed, Parbhani, Jalna and Hingoli districts.

Latur division, which covers Latur, Nanded and Osmanabad, reported a slightly better pass percentage of 89.79%. Of the 85,569 students who wrote the exam here, 76,832 passed.

Sugata Punne, the chairperson of the Aurangabad division of MSBSHE, said the division has bettered its performance when compared to last year. “The Aurangabad division is not far behind others. I congratulate all successful students and teachers. I also appeal to all students who could not clear the exam to not lose their heart and start afresh,” she said.

The Aurangabad division reported pass percentage of 95.11% in the science, 90.35% in commerce, 80.17% in arts and 80.13% in vocational courses. Girls (92.13%) in the division reported a better pass percentage than the boys (85.66%).

College officials said a section of students failing to understand the changes in the examination pattern might have reflected in the relatively poor pass percentage. “The revised exam pattern made it obligatory upon students to gain knowledge of the majority of chapters. Those who failed to so, either failed or scored less,” Rajanikant Garud, vice-principal of Deogiri College said.

As many as 11,987 students from Aurangabad division scored distinction (75% & above) while another 76,832 secured first class by getting 60% or more.

327,['17/07/2020'],Woman cop found living with lover at quarantine centre,"Nagpur: An extramarital affair surfaced at Regional Police Training School (RPTS) quarantine centre after the wife of a missing man approached Bajaj Nagar police station, recently.

The married man had allegedly been taken to the centre by a special branch woman constable who was asked to go in institutional quarantine along with other colleagues when a police officer tested Covid19 positive some days back.

DCP Zone II Vivek Masal told TOI that a departmental inquiry has been set up against the woman cop for indiscipline. “She had introduced the man as her husband to NMC health team who had come for contact tracing of the officer who tested positive,” he said.

Posing as husband and wife, they lived for over three days in the RPTS centre.

Masal said after it came to fore that both are not married to each other, the man was shifted to VNIT hostel quarantine centre while the woman constable continues to remain where she was.

The cop and the married man had been in a relationship, it is learnt.

Sources said it was not confirmed if the woman constable is married or has separated from her spouse.

The man is said to be working with the department of posts. His wife was unaware about him being admitted to the quarantine centre. She somehow came to know about the extramarital affair of her husband. She even visited the RPTS but was turned away by guards.

Later, she lodged a complaint with Bajaj Nagar police, and met Commissioner of Police Dr BK Upadhyay, who ordered an inquiry.

It is reliably learnt that the woman constable and the man know each other since October last year.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Several tribal organisations have requested the government to divide the Araku parliamentary constituency into three districts. This comes in the wake of the chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy announcing that 13 districts would be reorganised into 25 districts as per the Lok Sabha constituencies. However, the chief minister is believed to have agreed to making Araku Lok Sabha constituency into two districts given its size.

The Araku Lok Sabha constituency is not only geographically larger than other constituencies in the state but also one of the largest in south India. It includes Rampachodavaram assembly segment in East Godavari, Araku Valley and Paderu segments in Visakhapatnam; Parvatipuram, Saluru and Kurupam in Vizianagaram and Palakonda in Srikakulam. As per statistics, the tribal area comprises 52.9% of the total area of in Visakhapatnam district , 26.62% of Vizianagaram and 38.79% of East Godavari district.

MLAs, including the speaker Tammineni Sitaram and Dharmana Prasada Rao, have requested that Seetampeta ITDA, which includes Palakonda Assembly segment in Srikakulam, should not be disturbed in the district reorganisation.

“Rampachodavaram is sprawled across 5,000 sq kms and has a population of more than two lakh tribals . It should be made into a district,” the president of Indian Confederation of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples of Andhra Pradesh, G Ramgopal demanded. Araku LS constituency should be reorganised into three districts, he said.

“Instead of parliamentary constituencies being taken as unit, we demand that each ITDA be made into a district and provided with autonomous powers . We are in the fifth schedule and the government should plan before reorganising the districts. We have seen how tribal pockets were divided into small pieces in Telangana. The tribal area in Telangana has lost its geographical shape. Once the tribals lose their majority then demands for converting schedule areas as non-schedule areas would rise. We will lose our rights and powers too,” the convenor of Adivasi Porata Samithi JAC Ramarao Dora said.

Ramgopal said creating small districts by safeguarding the tribal rights would serve the cause of reorganising the districts.

MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday directed Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ( MSRTC ) to reinstate within four weeks 14 drivers who were sacked after they were diagnosed with colour blindness during a routine check-up.

It also directed each of them be paid back wages from the day their services were discontinued until the day they have been provided with alternative posts having the same pay-scale and service benefits.

“The financial, emotional and mental injuries suffered by the bus drivers before us today cannot simply be measured in terms of money,” said a bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Riyaz Chagla. The verdict came on petitions by the drivers who had an “unblemished record” and families dependent on them.

Their plea for alternative employment was rejected citing a July 29, 2016, circular which stated that “once a driver has been declared unfit by reason of colour blindness, such driver is not entitled to an alternative service or job with MSRTC”.

The judges said MSRTC’s action violated Persons With Disabilities Act, 1995, and Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. “The petitioners have admittedly acquired their disability (colour blindness) during employment,” they said, adding that the petitioners were entitled to other jobs as reasonable accommodation under the 2016 Act.

The judges quashed and set aside a clause in the circular which treated the period between diagnosis of a disability and decision about fitness of the employee or his alternative employment as leave without pay and carried the earned leave of the earlier job to the new job. They said the clause was ultra vires of the 2016 Act, as also violative of Article 14 (Right to Equality) of the Constitution.

The cops are probing whether her elaborate social network has any anti-social tilt to it, like honey-trapping and extortion.

Top ministers, doctors, a health ministry official, a couple of well-established legal practitioners, social workers and such influential persons are learnt to be among the frequently contacted numbers in the woman’s contact list. Her mobile phone is now under scanner for her complicity in some crime. A couple of persons with crime records too are in her contact list, it’s reliably learnt. “A murder convict with couple of serious offences is also close to her,” said a source.

A police source said a civic body official and the woman in question had around 50-60 calls between them within a short period, before the audio-leak kicked up a storm on social media. Sources also claimed that the official had ‘gifted’ the woman a high-end mobile phone handset.

“There are many influential persons in her network but we are probing whether they were merely professional contacts or there is some other angle to it, which may constitute a crime,” said a senior official from crime branch without revealing much due to the sensitive nature of the ongoing probe.

Though cops have maintained silence regarding the woman, her contacts with influential people are now under the scanner. “A highly respected man from legal fraternity too had flown down from Mumbai to meet her,” said a police source.

After having landed in a controversial episode in the health sector, the woman’s close contacts with ministers were laid bare when a couple of ministers called up the cops, urging them to assist her in the problem she was facing. “Some black-mailers used the woman as a ladder to make crores of rupees, and she too has seen a meteoric rise in her social networking in the last couple of years,” said a reliable source.

This seven-member committee will advise the government on various modalities for completion and commissioning of the South Goa district hospital with an attached private medical college, the 120-bed hospital at Tuem, the super-speciality block and tertiary care centre at Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim.

Other members of the committee will be the additional secretary (finance), director of health services, the dean, Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, Dr Saryadev Malik, chief executive officer at Gurunanak Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai, Dr Amir Mookim attached to IQVIA and Dr Anil D’Cruz, professor and chief of the department of head at neck surgery at Tata Memoria Hospital, Mumbai.

A few months ago, the government had expressed its plan to operate these four new healthcare facilities with participation of private players.

The construction of the 500-bed South Goa district hospital is nearing completion and will be handed over to the health department shortly, an officer said.

Constructed through the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC), this is one of the most delayed projects. The outpatient department (OPD) here was made functional in May, but the private college attached to the hospital is yet at the initial stage.

The construction of hospital at Tuem is under way.

The Rs 386 crore super-speciality block at GMC, being constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna, is nearly 76% complete. The strengthening of facilities for tertiary care cancer centres has also been planned under the tertiary care component of the national programme.

BHUBANESWAR: With healthcare staff and police personnel on the forefront of the fight against the unknown enemy — which poses a greater risk to the lives of those with comorbidities — neither can or should allow their fitness levels to drop.

Waking up to this fact perhaps, the commissionerate police has now decided to ensure the fitness of its staff in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack .

Commissioner of police Sudhanshu Sarangi has made it mandatory for overweight personnel to attend a six-week refresher’s course on body fitness and exercise.

Altogether 8,000 personnel work under the commissionerate police in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. Hectic and erratic work schedules owing to staff shortage in most police stations have led to many personnel suffering from several diseases like hypertension and diabetes.

From next week, all the police personnel will be monitored according to the body mass index (BMI), which measures the fat deposit in the human body based on the height and weight of the person. Doctors will educate the cops about the ideal body weight according to their age and height. The database will be kept in the police hospital here.

“We will try to complete the health check-up (height/weight measurement) of all our personnel by July 30. A three-month deadline will be given to those who are found to be overweight according to the BMI calculation, to reduce their weight. In November, the overweight personnel will again be tested,” Sarangi stated in his order.

The top cop said a six-week refresher course on body fitness and exercise will be launched for those who fail to reduce their weight by November. They will be subjected to compulsory exercise every morning in addition to the six-week refresher fitness course, Sarangi said.

The police commissioner also warned of disciplinary action if the personnel ignored his order. “The defaulters may face salary cut and compulsory retirement from service on health grounds. I appeal to all my staff members to realise the unprecedented health crisis caused by the Covid-19 virus. Since the vaccine is in a trial stage, we all have to take care of ourselves and stay fit,” Sarangi said.

The police commissioner said fitness holds key to policing activities. Immediately after recruitment, most personnel take care of their health and exercise to remain fit. But subsequently, they start ignoring their fitness, he added.

This affects the students as the online database is often used by state-level and central agencies for admission processes,” he said.

The next HSC examination will be based on revised curriculum. Suresh Lipane, a vice-principal, said the upgraded curriculum has put stress on application of knowledge. “The new syllabus has relatively increased topics and framed somewhat on the lines of CBSE.

He said like Mumbai, augmentation of beds by setting up jumbo facilities in those areas had started and nearly 1,000 oxygen beds and over 300 ICU beds will be added in few days. He said the state sought relaxation in plasma collection norms, which will make it easier for more blood banks to participate.

While NMMC reported 273 fresh cases and four deaths, taking the count to 10,546 and toll to 322, it is looking at increasing daily testing by around five times. Around 500 samples are being sent for testing daily. Around 40,000 antigen kits have arrived and 60,000 more are being procured. These tests will be free for symptomatic patients and close contacts.

NMMC chief Abhijit Bangar told the administration to start working on a pathology lab for testing samples. The lab is expected to be set up in eight days. NMMC has five authorised labs now. The earlier chief had decided to have a dedicated lab but due to labour shortage and reluctance to work at Vashi Covid hospital, the decision was not implemented.

“As Bangar took charge on Tuesday, he responded quickly to pleas for an in-house path laboratory,” said B N Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation. People were being made to wait endlessly for results of swab tests. The other option was to opt for private labs, which would charge Rs1,800-2,800 per test.

PCMC reported 134 cases and seven deaths on Thursday. Cases shot up to 4,469 and toll to 107. Meanwhile, 63 tested positive in Panvel rural but no death was reported.

Since the start of the month there have been 786 fatalities, taking the toll to 1,032 on July 16 from just 246 on June 30.Of the deaths reported in July, a staggering 562 came in the past eight days alone at a rate of three an hour, which took Covid-19 deaths per million to 17.2 as on July 16, compared to four per million on June 30. Most of the deaths in June came in the last two weeks of the month. On June 15, the state had only 88 deaths, but the figure rose to 246 by June 30. As on May 30, the number of fatalities stood at 51.Bengaluru, with its better health infrastructure, but also more cases, has led the way with 507 deaths — 412 of which have been between July 1 and 16. Bidar (53) stands second on this grim statistic, followed by Dakshina Kannada (52), Ballari (51), Mysuru (40) and Dharwad (52).Epidemiologists and clinical experts TOI spoke to insist that unlike rising cases, which is truly beyond the control of authorities, many deaths can be prevented. The state, they say, must consciously put in place prevention strategies.Dr CN Manjunath, member, Karnataka Covid-19 taskforce, said: “We did expect cases to go up since the virus was expected to peak and we’ve also ramped up testing. I completely agree that we must focus on reducing deaths. For this, there must be better coordination. Many beds are unfortunately occupied by asymptomatic or patients with less than moderate symptoms, which should not happen. These beds must be utilised to treat sick patients.”As cases increase globally, Manjunath said that the pathophysiology of the disease is being better understood, which will result in changed treatment protocol.Earlier this week, medical education minister K Sudhakar, quoting from the Mahabharata, had said: “Pandavas chose Krishna over his huge Yadava army. Likewise to win any war, confidence is key. No country can ever be prepared for a pandemic of this scale. Fight this pandemic with courage and trust the government.”But, the government has been failing its people since it has not even audited deaths efficiently. As on July 15, only about 100 of the 928 deaths were audited.Dr S Sacchidanand, who spearheads the Covid-19 death audit committee, said: “We’ve recommended to the government that the auditing process be decentralised. Given that most experts are busy treating patients, there has been a delay in auditing. We’ve done about 100 and another 50 will be completed soon.”Earlier, it was late reporting, comorbidities and ignoring symptoms that were seen as major reasons, Sacchidanand said, adding: “But I’m not sure what the reasons for the high surge in the last two weeks could be.”",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77010038,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-206569,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/with-2-deaths-per-hour-july-accounts-for-76-of-total-deaths/articleshow/77007613.cms

How challenging is basic policing in the middle of a pandemic ?

Not just policing, every field of human activity has been adversely affected by the pandemic. Policing is an essential service and cannot be shut down or scaled down. The virus poses a big risk for our field staff. We have to perform our duty amid social distancing and face masks, by complying with the government ’s Covid-19 guidelines.

What are your priorities for the new post?

I will first try to understand the basics. Only then will I be able to draw a roadmap. But there is something called a system and that system works. I will be a part of the system and fulfil my mandate.

How have you ensured better functioning of police stations?

It has been my focus to encourage staff in police stations to work for the benefit of the people and act tough against criminals. Police can command respect through good conduct and transparent functioning.

Are crime control and delivery of services to citizens taking a beating amid the pandemic?

I do not think so. Police always work amid challenges. As the pandemic has created an unprecedented situation, we have to fight it and ensure that the grievances of the people are properly addressed at the police stations. Both visitors and our colleagues at police stations should adopt all safety precautions.

How hard was it to conduct the Rath Yatra this year?

It was a big challenge. With the support of the public and team work of all government departments and leadership of senior officers, Rath Yatra passed peacefully. All stakeholders, including servitors and the media, did their best.

According to police, Jyoti Misra, who hailed from Angotha village , eloped with Rohit Yadav, who worked as a private veterinary doctor in the neighbouring Brijpura village of Mainpuri district in 2018 and they eventually got married. The woman’s family lodged a police complaint under section 363/366 (kidnapping) of the IPC. However, the case was dropped after she gave a statement before the court that she had married Rohit on her own will.

After hearing Jyoti’s decision, her brothers allegedly decided to kill her but were dissuaded by their family members, who advised them to wait for the right opportunity.

During interrogation, the arrested accused – including Jyoti’s 19-year-old brother Gulshan Misra, and her two cousins, including 28-year-old Raghvendra Misra, the main accused in the case – said that local residents used to insult them over their sister’s marriage and no one wanted to marry their own daughters into their family.

While Jyoti was shot six times, her husband sustained a single-shot bullet injury. The latter is still undergoing treatment at Saifai hospital.

Mainpuri superintendent of police Ajay Kumar said, “The accused said that they wanted to incapacitate Jyoti’s husband by shooting him on his leg but the bullet hit his stomach instead. They wanted to make him realise his mistake of marrying an upper-caste woman.”

Kumar said that two country-made pistols, used in the crime, have been recovered from their possession.

353,['17/07/2020'],IOC plans more compressed biogas units in Tamil Nadu,"NAMAKKAL: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has planned to set up more number of compressed biogas (CBG) units in the country.

In a video conference with reporters from Puduchatram in Namakkal district on Thursday, executive director and state head of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) P Jayadevan said IOC would be responsible for the compressed biogas and this can be consumed as a green renewable energy for automotive and industrial applications.

“Through central government’s sustainable alternative towards affordable transportation (SATAT), IOC envisages a target production of 15 million metric tonne of compressed biogas from 5,000 plants across the country by 2023,” he said.

Jayadevan said CBG is a cost-effective biofuel to the vehicle owner. The state currently has five compressed biogas units and it is being sold through the outlets at the cost of Rs 59.42 per kilo. A small car with compressed biogas would give a mileage of 27km/kilo translating to a running cost of Rs.2.20 per kilometer which would result in substantial savings in the fuel bill.

Talking about compressed biogas producing plant in Puduchatram, he said the outlet was expected to process about 300 tonnes of feed stock including pressed mud and chicken litter every day to produce 15 tonnes of CBG. “This would be supplied to five IOC retail outlets including Namakkal and Salem districts in this region,” he said, adding that, this plant also would supply compressed biogas to few industries in this area as industrial fuel.

LUCKNOW: Adhering to the UGC guidelines on examinations, the UP government on Thursday decided to assess the final semester/graduating students through an examination conducted in either online or offline, or a blended mode. Cancelling exams of all other semesters/year, the government said that the first and second year students would be promoted on the basis of internal evaluation and performance in the previous semester/year. Over 33 lakh students will be promoted across the state.

Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma , who holds the education portfolio , told reporters that universities where examinations and evaluation ended before the lockdown, will have no changes in their results. The universities that were able to conduct a few examinations have been asked to carry out the evaluation and include the marks in the final results.

Those students who appeared for examinations before lockdown and have qualified, or are eligible for the backpaper, will be promoted to the next semester, and their remaining examinations stands cancelled. Those who have failed in these exams will be declared as unsuccessful for the year 2020.

Following UGC guidelines, the terminal semester/final year examinations at higher education institutions of he state would be finished latest by September 30, and the results announced by October 15 for undergraduate programmes and October 31 for postgraduate courses. In a bid to ensure that no graduating student is at a disadvantage, it has been decided that students who miss the examinations for any reason, would be given an opportunity to appear in special examinations for courses and papers as and when the university is feasible to do.

Sharma said that the students of the terminal semester/ final year who have some papers left, will have to take examinations in offline, online or blended mode as per the feasibility and suitability.

Universities will do 100% evaluation on the basis of internal evaluation for students of the first year of the annual pattern of examinations. First year students will be awarded average marks (scored in subjects in second year) for subjects for which examination couldn't take place. This applies to students who have scored passing marks in each subject. Second semester students who will be promoted without examinations will be awarded average marks scored in first semester (held in December, 2019).

For intermediate semester/year students (applicable for three, four and five year courses), excluding the first and final year, a composite of 50% marks on the basis of the pattern of internal evaluation adopted by the universities and the remaining 50% marks can be awarded on the basis of performance in previous exams.

PUNE: The fear of repeating last year’s poor performance along with a trend of academically bright students taking up arts and commerce seem to have pulled up Pune district’s pass percentage to 92.24% in the higher secondary certificate (HSC) examination. The result rose by 4.59% when compared with last year’s performance.

The highest difference was recorded in HSC vocational and arts streams with a spike of 8.06% and 6.63% more students passing as compared to last year. The least failure rate was in science at 2.43% followed by commerce at 7.8%, HSC Vocational at 10.61 and arts at 19.39%.

Teresa David, former principal of Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said the fear of another poor performance after 2019 helped better the results this year.

The change in the paper pattern gives equal emphasis on easy, difficult and very difficult sections helped the students pass in mathematics, physics and chemistry, David said.

Hrishikesh Soman, principal of Symbiosis College of Arts and Commerce, said, “The profile of students taking up arts and commerce is changing. The first cut-off percentage for admission in standard XI arts in our college was 96-97%, last year. There is a beeline for psychology, economics and political science. Hence more students with stronger academic backgrounds are going for arts in the last two-three years,” he said.

PUNE: These students may not have had access to the best of opportunities but their grit and determination to succeed ensured they did well in the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examination.

This year, 55 children of waste pickers appeared for the HSC exams, of which 47 passed the exam while eight scored over 70% marks. Many children of waste pickers associated with the Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat passed the exams with good marks. Most of the students are first-generation learners working towards a bright future despite all odds.

Prerna Gaikwad, a Commerce student, said, “I scored 76.3% and I couldn’t be happier. My mother is very proud. We did not have classes because of the lockdown, but I would study for 2-3 hours in the mornings and evenings. During the day, I also had to do household chores, cook food, etc. I am interested in pursuing hotel management.”

Ajay Pandit, who scored 71.3% in HSC, said that he made the most of the time he got while training for the army academy. “I joined the army academy last year and I have been studying for the board exams as well as the academy. I would wake up at 4.30am and study before the academy training on ground began at 6am. English was a difficult subject but I requested my teachers to help me. I see my future in the army,” he said.

Gaurish Rajguru, whose mother is a waste picker and father is employed with a private company, is ecstatic with the 78% marks she scored. Always a bright student, she got admission at Fergusson College . She intends to complete her graduation in Arts and appear for UPSC examinations to become an IAS officer.

“I didn’t really face any challenges. I would study throughout the day, whenever I had the time. Economics was a tough subject for me so I spent more time on it. I studied on my own, without any help from anyone. I also wanted to set an example for my younger sister, who is in Std X,” said Rajguru.

This is the first financial dose of the total Rs 900 crore earmarked for the project.

The 82km Delhi-Meerut Corridor will pass through one of the most densely populated sections of the National Capital Region connecting Delhi to Uttar Pradesh. The corridor will not only be beneficial for the development of the region but will also help connect a large number of townships and centres of economic activity being planned along the section.

The project will have a 180kmph design speed, a first-of-its-kind rolling stock in India for regional transit services and will be implemented in phases between the cities. The corridor will have 24 stations and infrastructure will be used to offer local transit services in Meerut.

The 28-year-old didn’t come in direct contact but as precautionary measure got himself tested along with the three. He tested negative.

Centre sources told TOI, on Wednesday that the three had asked the 28-year-old also to follow their ambulance in an MUV containing their belongings and luggage. An SUV, in which the corona positive driver and both PAs had accompanied the MLC from Amravati to Nagpur, is also parked at Ravi Bhavan.

Sources said the three had put pressure on the driver to leave the premises even though the nodal officer asked him to stay back. Two cops deployed at the entrance remained mute spectators as the MLC’s men violated the norms. The 28-year-old driver had followed the MLC and his staff in the MUV from Amravati. All the four were referred by GMCH.

Sources said the in-charge officer initially tried to call up the driver after he failed to hold him back within the premises. The 28-year-old reportedly assured the officer he would return once the three are admitted and their belongings shifted to the ward. When the driver failed to return for a long time, the officer informed Sadar police.

As the police called him up and counselled him to return, the driver arrived around midnight of Wednesday. He would have to remain in quarantine till July 26. Sources said this was not the first such incident at Ravi Bhavan where security is lax. Earlier too, some inmates had tried to escape but the attempts were thwarted by health officials. “Fearing infection, cops stay away even when inmates adopt a threatening posture,” sources said.

In March, the city police had booked a woman for breaching home quarantine norms. She had fled to UP.

PUNE: Many students with visual impairment have done well in their higher secondary certificate (HSC) examinations.

Even though they faced challenges such as finding writers among others, some blind students from Fergusson College overcame all odds.

Rahul Galave, who scored a total of 507 marks, said, “My family was happy with my result. I was hoping to score at least 75%. I was excited when I found out I had scored 78%. It is always difficult to find writers, but I faced other challenges such as the online classes because of the lockdown, which were difficult to follow. But, extra classes at the hostel helped me.” He said he wants to take up journalism in future.

While online classes have been difficult for some, they have been of advantage for other blind students.

Shripad Nigade, who scored a total of 492 marks, said, “I face issues with braille. I have less sensation in my fingers that makes it difficult for me to feel the dots. So, I always studied using the computer. I would listen to online classes and educational videos . My teachers would give me audio recordings of books. I was hoping to get over 60% and I am glad I scored 75%.” He said he wanted to study law, while his mother wanted him to get a PhD.

He was caught with Rs 5 lakh from the capital town on July 12. Now, the ACB has found gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 72.26 lakh and Rs 55 lakh cash from his two bank lockers.

A statement from the ACB said that Sutreja, who was posted in Jamnagar, was booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act. After that, a team headed by ACP Ashutosh Parmar checked his two bank accounts in Sector-21 in Gandhinagar. “On frisking locker number 21 in SBI, we found ornaments of gold weighing 1,314.45 grams worth Rs 48.76 lakh and Rs 69,500. Apart from that, we also found gold ornaments and bars weighing 605.99 grams and silver ornaments weighing 115 grams worth Rs 23.49 lakh and Rs 55,000 cash from locker number 331 in a branch of SBI,” said an ACB official.

369,['17/07/2020'],Bengaluru: Negative antigen tests leave doctors jittery,"BENGALURU: Just before surgery in a private hospital in Bengaluru, a 77-year-old woman was subjected to an antigen test for Covid-19. Four hours later, the test showed she was negative and doctors went ahead with the operation although a swab sample was sent for an RT-PCR test as per protocol. Two days later the RT-PCR test confirmed she was indeed infected, leaving medical staff and surgeons who operated on her jittery.

“We need to treat people with serious complications immediately, but doctors and health workers are also putting themselves at risk,” said a senior medical surgeon. “RT-PCR tests take a long time so we go ahead with antigen tests, but given their poor efficiency, they are an exercise in futility.”

Of the 127 antigen tests conducted in this private hospital since 10 July, 27 were positive for the virus. Of the remaining 100 samples, RT-PCR tests showed 33 were positive.

Antigen tests began in Bengaluru last week with the government trumpeting that it would be major step forward in scaling up testing. Experts say these tests help quickly identify positive cases and trials have shown that they do so with an accepted level of efficiency, but protocol also mandates that an RT-PCR test be done on every negative antigen result and the anomalies in results are stark.

Dr V Ravi, a virologist at Nimhans and member, Karnataka Covid technical committee, had said earlier: “Unlike antibody kits, which measure the body’s response to the virus, antigen tests tell us if a person is positive or not. RT-PCR, for example, detects the virus’ genetic material, while antigen tests detect the virus’ protein (S protein).”

He had said antigen tests have an accuracy of 50-80% of RT-PCR positive samples, which means that if the result is positive with an antigen kit, there is no need for an RT-PCR test, but if negative, the sample will have to be re-confirmed through an RT-PCR test.

This, however, leaves hospitals in a huge quandary. “A patient tested negative on antigen test, but was an RT-PCR test showed she was positive. Now, two doctors and four nurses who assisted the patient are in home quarantine,” said Dr Praveen Kumar from a private hospital in Bengaluru South.

Dr Kumar said that government should make it mandatory to conduct RT-PCR test before proceeding with any medical treatment as antigen tests only end up exposing health workers to the virus.

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court recently granted bail to a man, who was arrested in a case under Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act as none of the victims named him in their statements.

The applicant, Manoj Jadhav, was arrested in December 2019 by the Pundliknagar police, along with others, for the offences punishable under section 370(A)(2) of Indian Penal Code , sections 3, 4, 5, 6 of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, section 65(E) of the Bombay Prohibition Act and section 67, 67(A) of Information Technology Act.

His arrest was made after two main accused, including a woman who were allegedly running the brothel, disclosed to the police that the applicant used to send picture of a girl through his mobile phone to the customers. Earlier, the district and sessions court had rejected Jadhav’s bail plea on February 24, 2020, following which he approached the high court through lawyer Joydeep Chatterji.

Chatterji argued that “at the most section 5(b) of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 stands attracted, which is punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than three years and not more than seven years. And that the antecedents of the applicant are clear.”

While granting conditional bail to the applicant recently, Justice V K Jadhav observed “prima facie it appears that the allegations against the applicant are restricted to the extent of section 5(1)(b) of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956. It further appears from the charge-sheet that none of the victims has taken the name of the present applicant and it thus appears that the applicant has merely forwarded the photographs of the victim to the prospective customers as forwarded to him by the person, who runs the brothel.”

The bench further observed “it thus appears that none of the offence as alleged against the applicant is punishable with death or imprisonment of life. There is no criminal history and the applicant has not indulged in similar activities prior to the registration of the present crime. Thus, considering the entire aspect of the case, I am inclined to release the applicant on bail with certain conditions.”

LUCKNOW: Amid allegations of the nexus between some members of Kanpur police and gangster Vikas Dubey, a video has gone viral purportedly showing suspended inspector KK Sharma sharing stage with the slain don at the wedding of his aide Amar Dubey .

Sharma, who was posted at the Chaubeypur police station when the Bikru ambush took place, was suspended after it was found that he had leaked the information about the police raid to Vikas Yadav, giving him enough time to plan the ambush on July 2. Now, this video gives a further proof about his 'proximity' with the gangster. The wedding of Amar Dubey, nephew and aide of Vikas Dubey, took place on June 29. One of the 20 prime accused in the Bikru carnage, Amar Dubey was killed in a police encounter two days before Vikas himself was neutralised.

The 29-second video which went viral on Thursday, shows Sharma, clad in a maroon shirt and black denim, standing on stage along with Vikas Duubey , behind bride Kshama and groom Amar, who are sitting. Vikas Dubey is standing in the middle and Sharma is on his right.

When Sharma shifts a little away, Vikas is seen taking a jibe: “Arrey aur nazdik aa jaao, daro nahi” (Come closer, don’t be afraid). Inspector Sharma instantly obliges the don and the two pose for the camera. Sharma also posed with the groom.

A police officer, who wished not to be named, said that Sharma had stayed at Amar's wedding till late in night. A source in the crime branch said that it was because of Dubey's influence that Sharma was posted at the outpost near his village.

Inspector General of police, Kanpur Range, Mohit Agarwal, said that all these are part of the SIT probe.

“We are also probing on all those who were in touch with Dubey. Kanpur police had suspended Sharma on suspicion of his involvement,” he said.

The outlet will collect ready material from collection centres in villages in Ramtek tehsil and will work as a central distribution centre,” said deputy conservator Prabhunath Shukla.

Rathod also interacted with SHG members and stressed on the need for increasing production and establish Vanamrut as a popular brand on the lines of other companies.

Under the project, currently 20 SHGs are working in nine villages providing employment to around 200 women.

“As middlemen fleece villagers by offering lower price for non-timber forest produce , outlets like Vanamrut are long-term solutions to providing livelihood opportunities based on forests,” said Rathod.

The minister said Vanamrut products should reach malls and other big retail chains besides being made available online.

In another development, Rathod visited Transit Treatment Centre (TTC) at Seminary Hills. Ramtek MLA Ashish Jaiswal was also present along with senior forest officials. Rathod was told that more than 4,000 animals were rescued since the TTC’s inception in 2014-15.

The state government submitted its reply and expressed its reservations on Covid testing of asymptomatic persons. It reiterated its apprehension that testing asymptomatic persons would create confusion, but this time around, the government has based its argument on the accuracy of RT-PCR test.In a note supplied to the court by the government pleader, it said, “There is no question of allowing all asymptomatic persons to go for Covid testing, who wish to get the it done voluntarily. This is because of two reasons. Firstly, the guidelines do not provide for the testing of asymptomatic persons, and secondly, the RT-PCR test’s specificity is around 70%, leading to there being chances of false positives and negatives. This may, in turn, lead to the creation of a false sense of security as well as unnecessary treatment burden.”Earlier, the government told the HC that conducting Covid-19 tests on asymptomatic patients would create a “fear psychosis among people” as many more cases would be confirmed than the numbers under the present testing policy formed on the May 18 guidelines of the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).The state government reiterated its stand and cited a report by a panel of three doctors – Dr Tejas Patel, Dr Pankaj Shah and Dr Atul Patel – whose opinion in this regard concurred with the ICMR guidelines that asymptomatic individuals should not be tested.However, the medical fraternity and a couple of other litigants were insisting on the need to increase testing. The Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA) even cited a Supreme Court order to this effect. To this, the state government said that the SC order should be interpreted in proper manner because the apex court was talking about testing on patients and not on asymptomatic individuals when it insisted on more testing. Moreover, the SC has not disapproved the ICMR guidelines, on which Gujarat has based its testing policy.The government has said that it has been conducting enough tests, 7,000 to 8,000 at present, and there are no patients who are denied testing.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77010311,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-499906,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/testing-asymptomatic-people-not-advisable-govt/articleshow/77008564.cms

He attacked Raje in a series of tweets. “Former CM Vasundhara Raje making a strong effort to save the minority government of Ashok Gehlot, Raje has also made calls to many Congress MLAs,” he claimed.

“Vasundhara called her close friends in Congress. One Jat MLA each from Sikar and Nagaur districts asking to keep a distance from @SachinPilot”, tweeted the MP from Nagaur, who is an alliance partner of BJP.

In another tweet, Beniwal said according to media reports, Gehlot has claimed that he had call recording (of the alleged deal). “Tapping phone is a violation of the rights given by the constitution, in a clean democracy , Gehlotji is doing such tricks which are not worthy of him,” he tweeted.

Beniwal, a former BJP MLA, was kicked out of the party due to his antagonistic relations with the former chief minister. After parting ways with BJP, he contested as an Independent from the Khinvsar assembly seat in Nagaur in the 2013 Assembly election and won. He formed the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party in 2018, ahead of the assembly elections in 2018. His party won in three Assembly seats, including his own.

Considering his popularity among the youth in his community, the BJP formed an alliance with him during the Lok Sabha elections. He won the Nagaur parliamentary seat.

Beniwal’s allegation comes at a time when Raje has been keeping a studied silence on the political development in her home state.

Pilot had lashed out at the Gehlot government for moving the Supreme Court to appeal against a high court order in a bid to save the bungalow allotted to Raje at 13, Civil Lines despite the party opposing such a provision for former chief ministers. Pilot had also attacked Gehlot for not holding an enquiry in the mining scam when Raje was the CM, accusing him of an unholy alliance with her.

After Sachin Pilot questioned the allotment of bungalow to Raje, two of her loyalists on Thursday questioned Pilot for holding a government bungalow at Delhi. They said former chief minister was allotted bungalow as a senior legislator and not as former chief minister.

A total of 7,79,931 students appeared for the exams from schools and 7,20,209 of them passed. The pass percentage among girls was 94.8%, while 89.4% boys cleared the exams. Also, commerce stream students fared better than those who studied science.

Of the 7,127 schools, 2,120 secured a 100% pass rate. Among the districts, Tirupur topped with 97.1% pass rate followed by Erode and Coimbatore at 96.99% and 96.39%.

Hemapooja S from Shree Niketan Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Thiruvallur scored 597 out of 600 marks. She secured full marks in commerce, accountancy, economics and got 99 in Tamil, English and business maths.

“I didn’t expect these numbers after the exam. But I put consistent efforts from the beginning,” she said, adding that except English, she found the papers easy.

Hemapooja said the new syllabus and question pattern were advanced. “Questions were knowledge-based and they could not be answered by rote learning,” she said. She has enrolled in a CA programme now.

R Praveen Kumar from SRV Boys Higher Secondary School in Rasipuram secured 590 out of 600 in the science stream. He scored centums in maths, biology, chemistry, and got 99 in physics and Tamil, and 92 in English.

“The question papers were easier than the previous year. Except English, I found rest of the exams easy,” he said. Kumar is now preparing for NEET and taking lessons online.

H Haseena Banu from Chennai scored 588 out of 600. She has plans to study BCom and then write the civil services exams.

“In our school, students have got more centums this year. But generally, many schools are saying that science stream students have got less marks,” said N Vijayan, senior principal of Zion Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Tambaram.

S Selene Vinodhini, principal of Stanes Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School in Coimbatore, said the highest mark in arts group was higher than that in the science group in their school. She said the outgoing students had studied Class X under the old syllabus and then enrolled under the new syllabus in Class XII, something that could have affected performance of the science students.

The results of 700 students who were absent for final Class XII exam on March 24 will be released after the re-exam on July 27.

Of 2,835 differently abled students, 2,506 have cleared the exams. Fifty of the 62 prisoners who wrote the exams passed.

Students can apply for copy of answer scripts, retotalling and revaluation from their respective schools. Dates will be announced later.

Ahmedabad witnesses a glimpse at the beginning of the outbreak, but the latest infection rates based on Rt values (effective reproduction rate), how many persons a Covid patient is expected to infect, show that the districts of Morbi, Valsad, Mahisagar, Gir Somnath , Dahod, Amreli, Surendranagar, and Junagadh among others face the risk of high transmission rates in the coming days.Ahmedabad on the other had has the lowest transmission rate now. While daily reporting does not represent the actual transmission rates, a statistical method can find the Rt (effective reproduction number). An Rt of 1 means that the epidemic is holding steady. For every person who is infected, another one becomes infected. At an Rt below 1, the epidemic will fade out, but will take some time. If the value is above 1, it will grow exponentially. If 1,000 people have Covid and the Rt is 1.3, they will infect 1,300 people. That second set will infect 1,690 and so on.In Gujarat, Morbi district has the highest Rt of 2 which should ring alarm bells, while Ahmedabad has the lowest Rt, 0.91. Surat, Rajkot, Mahisagar, Dahod, Amreli and Surendranagar have values between 1.11 and 1.87 and need to be brought down.The statistical method hinges on a mathematical model of Real Time Bayesian Estimation, first suggested by scientists Luís MA Bettencourt and Ruy M Ribeiro. Based on this model, data scientists Nidhi Gupta, Harsimar Singh and Anurag Gupta have set up a realtime Rt tracker based on daily press releases by the government.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77010326,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-627827,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/infection-rate-must-be-reduced-experts/articleshow/77008519.cms

UDHAGAMANDALAM: A male leopard was found dead in Adupukutty beat of the Mudumalai Tiger reserve (MTR) in the Nilgiris on Wednesday.

The one-year-old animal had suffered injuries on its forehead and back, forest range officer Dayananthan said.

Postmortem held on Thursday revealed that fight with a large carnivore might have caused the death. “We found a half-eaten deer near the spot. A tiger, which had hunted the deer, might have attacked the leopard when it tried to snatch the meat,” the official said.

The teeth and nails of the leopard were found intact. The carcass was burnt inside the forest after autopsy. Samples collected from the carcass will be sent for laboratory analysis to find out the exact cause of death, Dayananthan added.

The stricter enforcement of lockdown norms re-imposed since Thursday will also now include the outskirts of the city — the entire Madhyamgram and Barasat areas.Sources, however, on Thursday maintained that inclusion of some new areas in the list after Sunday could not be ruled out. “We are awaiting a signal from the state health department for clamping stricter lockdown in areas where there has been a spurt in Covid cases. First, we have to bring them under containment zones and then enforce the lockdown measures,” said a KMC official.In all, about 12 zones managed to shed their containment tag. Similarly, at least eight new areas were added to the list. Out of the 24 zones, as many as 16 are either standalone buildings or housing complexes and only two are slums. There are six mixed zones.Among some of the biggest zones that have managed to come out of strict lockdown are the middle-class neighbourhood of Bijoygarh, the mixed zones of GS Bose Road and Adhar Chandra Das Road, the upscale Belvedere Road and the slum of Jawaharlal Dutta Lane.Interestingly, these changes were not only restricted to different clusters within the same area, but also spread out geographically across the city. At Bhowanipore, for example, one address in Chakrabria North managed to come out of the containment list, the one in Chakraberia South continued to languish on the list. Chakraberia though has also added another address to the city containment list. The same pattern was visible on Sarat Bose Road too.Among the new areas that will keep KMC worried are Sikdarpara Street at Posta, Ballygunge and Dover Lane.

Behala , another affected zone, has neither added or shed any of the two containment zones.At Madhyamgram and Barasat, all markets and standalone shops remained closed from 1pm on Thursday. “This restriction will be continued for two weeks.

384,['17/07/2020'],Bangalore Corona Update: 25 private hospitals in Bengaluru close down,"Display contact number: HC

BENGALURU: Twenty-five hospitals in Bengaluru have shut operations since Covid-19 hit in March and many more are likely to follow suit due to a staff crunch, says Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (Phana).“Some of these 25 hospitals have completely shut shop, while others have restricted operations to outpatient services only,” said Dr R Ravindra, president, Phana. “These are all small nursing homes, but they could have been of great help now. It’s been a tough time for private hospitals.”Over the past year, 58 of 384 hospitals in Bengaluru have closed down. Staff shortage is a major factor in closures.A Phana member said the trouble began in March when the number of patients visiting OPDs plummeted. “When the lockdown was announced, some hospitals had to ask nurses and ward boys to take leave,” the member said. “Many left Bengaluru. Then, fearing for their safety, staff didn’t want to return. We can’t run hospitals without human resources?”Dr Nagaraj HN, an orthopaedic surgeon, who runs Deepak Hospital in South Bengaluru, is now seeing only outpatients after his 150-strong staff shrunk to 12 over the past month. “If the government provides staff, I can run the hospital. It is impossible otherwise,” he said.He went on to say, “The government’s latest threat is to disconnect power and water supply if we don’t accommodate Covid-19 patients. To treat a Covid-19 patient, we need to have an ICU. But to run an ICU, I don’t have the required staff.”A maternity home in Rajajinagar, established in 1962 and which attended to deliveries everyday, is another that has closed. It is now functioning only as a clinic. “I have not stopped practising. I see OPD patients in the clinic. I conduct deliveries in another hospital,” the gynaecologist who ran the hospital said.Her husband, who looked after maintenance of the facility, said: “We don’t have nurses or housekeeping staff. They are all scared to work. The government is not helping small hospitals survive.”Phana members said it is not easy for these hospitals to reopen. “Under Karnataka Private Medical Establishments (KPME) Act, several restrictions are relaxed for existing hospitals. For example, fire safety criteria states there must be space enough for an ambulance to move within the hospital compound. If these hospitals want to reopen post-Covid-19, they may not get exemptions under KPME,” said Dr Ravindra.The high court on Thursday directed the government to modify its July 15 circular to ensure private hospitals display phone numbers which relatives of Covid patients can dial and lodge a complaint on denial of admission. A division bench said the modified circular has to be issued through the state executive so that the government can initiate action against erring hospitals under the Disaster Management Act.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77012140,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112903,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/25-private-hospitals-close-down-in-bluru-due-to-staff-crunch/articleshow/77007732.cms

This does not help anyone. It shifts focus from more important work at hand and adds to our problems.

KOLKATA: Already saddled with the ongoing battle against the deadly coronavirus KMC ) and Kolkata Police now have the bu rden of rescuing victims of social ostracization . The victims are mostly targets of “extra-cautious” neighbours, who have become “self-proclaimed” Covid fighters in the neighbourhood.Take the case of Indrani Sengupta, a government hospital nurse and a Bramhapur (Garia) resident who was subjected to ostracization after her husband tested positive a week ago. “After getting my husband admitted to the hospital, I returned home and found that I was running short of essentials and a few medicines. While I requested one of my distant relatives, who is also a neighbour, to buy me the essentials, he was threatened not to enter my house. I pleaded with the agitators but all my requests fell on deaf ears for three days. On the fourth day, I had to call police for help,” Sengupta said.The experience of businessman Swapan Basu was equally uncalled for. A resident of Siriti (Behala), Basu had to bear the brunt of some of his neighbours when he was running a high temperature for a couple of days and went to a medicine shop to buy paracetamols last weekend. “I could not imagine that someone would call the cops and the cops would actually turn up to inquire whether I had tested positive. Neither me or any of my family members were allowed to move out of home even for buying essentials for the next few days. Finally, I was forced to get myself tested. Fortunately, I tested negative,” Basu said.Police commissioner Anuj Sharma had recently instructed his men to take action against all forms of ostracization. “No form of social shaming of Covid patients, their family or Covid warriors will be tolerated and legal action will follow,” he had said. The instruction came after specific complaints were made to police from areas like Ballygunge Gardens and Alipore.KMC ward coordinators conceded that they were flooded with complaints of such ostracization cases. Complaints are also pouring in at the mayor’s office. “One of the complainants wrote that his north Kolkata house was stoned by a section of agitators,” said a KMC source.A school principal from Harinavi, who has lost a relative to Covid and was ostracized so much that political parties had to step in, said it was the stigma attached with the death that has hurt them the most. “We live here for the past three decades. Our neighbours have always been like a family. We do appreciate their legitimate concerns but it hurts to know that even if a relative contracts the disease, you can be ostracized without even paying the person a single visit,” said the headmistress.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77012861,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-30624,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pesky-neighbours-become-local-guardians-add-to-citys-misery/articleshow/77007720.cms

COIMBATORE: Five manhole cleaning robots were handed over to the Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation (CCMC) on Thursday.

The total cost of the ‘Robotic 2.0’ manhole cleaning robots, aka ,’Bandicoot’, is Rs2.12 crore, and they were sponsored by the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. The CCMC has put in Rs 20lakh, 10% of the cost of the machines as its share.

This comes after Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited had given the corporation another such manhole cleaning robot at a cost of Rs 32lakh, in October 2019. Back then, Coimbatore was the second city corporation after Gurgaon corporation in the country to use the upgraded version of the robot.

Minister for municipal administration S P Velumani unveiled the machines and handed them over to the corporation on Thursday.

Speaking to reporters, he said each of the five zones in the corporation would be given one machine. “When the machines are used, manual scavenging and manhole deaths would be completely avoided in the city,” he said.

The minister said soon 34 other cities in the state would be given a manhole cleaning robot each. “This was announced in the state assembly earlier as part of the grant requests for the municipal administration department,” he said.

The machine could do functions such as shoveling and picking of muck and waste from a manhole.

Mangaluru: After several attempts to attract expression of interest from construction companies, the Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) has finally found two bidders willing to participate in the tender process for the redevelopment of Central Market.

The MSCL has earmarked Rs 114 crore for the redevelopment of Central Market under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model. The old Central Market building was closed and merchants were shifted during the phase one of the lockdown, to prevent crowding in the city. Meanwhile, the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) has decided to demolish the old building.

MSCL MD Mohammed Nazeer said the work may begin within four months. “The tender process for the redevelopment of Central Market has begun. Two participants have come forward to take up the work, and we are expecting to complete the tender process within a month. They will be able to complete the design within two months, and the work may be started within four months,” Nazeer said.

On petitions pending in the high court, he said that the MSCL has sent a letter requesting the MCC to clear the hurdles.

Central Market Merchants’ Association (CMMA) has been fighting legally in the high court to get their premises back. The Dakshina Kannada district administration had banned all activities at the Central Market due to the pandemic, and the merchants were made to shift their business to the APMC Yard in Baikampady after the lockdown. The MCC had also issued a public notice announcing the closure of Central Market. The association has 151 wholesale merchants and 337 retailers, who until the lockdown functioned from this premise in the heart of the city.

AHMEDABAD: In response to a PIL seeking HC directions to the government to regulate the pricing of Tocilizumab injections and make adequate quantities available, the state government expressed its inability in this regard. It has said that these injections are manufactured by Switzeland-based F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and they are imported into India. Cipla Ltd markets and distributes these injections.

The state government has no power over fixing its maximum price or any reasonable price, neither over its import. The government has sought 4,597 injections from Cipla Ltd, but received only 2,320 injections. As many as 2,243 injections have been supplied to government and semi-government hospitals by the Gujarat Medical Services Corporation Ltd, and at present there are only 77 injections in stock. However, Cipla has promised the government 100 to 150 injections within a week.

The government also told the HC that is has procured these injections at lower prices than in the market. It has paid Rs 6,174 for 80mg against the Rs 8,112 market price, Rs 15,435 for 200mg as against the market rate of Rs 20,274 and Rs 30,860 for 400mg against the Rs 40,545 market price.

The government made it clear that Tocilizumab is a drug used for arthritis patients and not to reduce the viral load of Covid patients. For that, Remdesivir injections or Favipiravir tablets are prescribed.

CHENNAI: The pass percentage of Class XII students in 32 Greater Chennai Corporation higher secondary schools dipped by 5% this year. They secured a pass percentage of 85.8% as against the 90.49% last year.

Out of the 4,648 students who appeared for the examination, 3,988 passed. A total of 2,973 girls appeared for the exam of whom 2,682 cleared it; of the 1,675 boys, 1,306 passed. Six students scored centum in computer science . Six secured above 550 while 53 students scored above 500. Girls outperformed boys by 12%.

The number of students scoring 450 marks increased this year -- from 168 last year it touched 219.

The corporation higher secondary school in West Mambalam had a 100% pass percentage among 32 schools. Last year, four schools had achieved 100% pass percentage. Last year, four centums were secured by students in core science subjects.

Only seven schools have improved their performance compared to last year. The pass percentage in all the remaining schools has dipped.

V Munian, assistant educational officer, said the results were less impressive compared to last year mainly because the students could not cope with the new syllabus. “This was the first batch of students who studied the new syllabus. We have formed a committee to find out why some schools did not perform well. We will take measures and ensure results improve next year,” he said.

A headmaster from one of the schools said the students are usually trained with questions and revision tests to just reproduce what was in the books. “Since the focus this year was more on self-learning, both students and teachers could not cope. We will definitely change our teaching methods to ensure better results next time,” he said.

Another headmaster said science students did not perform as expected in the core subjects.

Corporation commissioner G Prakash said a committee will be formed to analyse the performance of the students and the teachers, and a report would be submitted. In some schools, the dip in performance has been more than 15%-20%. The strength of students has also reduced. It will be increased with various measures, Prakash said.

MANGALURU: A recent study conducted jointly by the department of community Medicine, Kasturba Medical College, Mangaluru and Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal casts doubt on the link between taking selfies and low self esteem. The study suggests selfie mania is more of an addiction and is likely to be categorised as a neurological disorder in the coming days.

Several studies in the past have pointed out that the habit of taking selfie is high among people with low self-esteem. However, the study conducted under the leadership of associate professor, department of community medicine Dr Ramesh Holla and published in the ‘De Gruyter’ reveals different aspects.

“There are a lot of literatures that links selfie mania with low self-esteem. We wanted to check it ourselves and hence conducted a study ‘Selfie’-boon or a bane? The results were different than we expected,” explains Holla.

A total of 366 individuals took part in the study. Of them, 267 were medical undergraduates and 99 were teaching faculty. Holla said the study revealed that students mostly took selfies to share their current lifestyle, whereas faculty took selfies for convenience.

It is found that selfies do not affect the self-esteem of an individual as the majority of the population were found to have a normal level of self-esteem.

“The study also pointed out that selfie taking is an addiction and also related to narcissism. Some individuals feel the day is incomplete without taking a selfie and sharing the same on social media platforms. As of the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, gaming disorder is officially considered as a mental disorder which has sufficiently increased the acceptance of other behavioural addictions and pathologies in the scientific community. Selfie mania is also likely to be considered as a disorder sooner or later,” he added.

Health department staffs are only informing people whose test positive and do not even bother to send an SMS to those whose samples show they are not infected.Shivanand (name changed) from Dharwad said he underwent a Covid test at a civil hospital in the city after his uncle tested positive. “I waited for four days, but wasn’t informed of the result,” he said. “It was a horrifying wait as I was assailed with negative thoughts. When I approached the hospital to find out the result, staff told me they inform only if a person tests positive. They expect us to somehow understand we are not infected.”A resident of Akshay Colony in Hubballi faced a worse ordeal. “My neighbours began ill-treating me after my landlord and his family tested positive,” the resident said. “I was also forced to go for a test, but I wasn’t told the result even after five days. When I contacted lab staff, I was told that if there is no call from health staff, my result is negative. I had a hard time convincing my neighbours who thought I was lying. I eventually convinced them by showing my call records.”District health officer Dr Yashwanth Madinkar said ICMR software can only sends alerts to those who test positive. “There is no protocol to inform people who test negative,” he said. “Many people have complained to me about this and I have brought it to the notice of the government.

As on Thursday, 7,053 streets were marked as containment zones, including streets on which apartments marked as such zones stand.Contrast this with the measly 29 containment zones – 20 of them streets – in mid-May and a picture of just how the city lost the plot emerges. The current containment zones include 6,371 streets, 621 apartments, 35 slums, 25 clusters and one hotel.Containment zones were initially considered the best way to check the spread, BBMP officials said, adding that lifting lockdown restrictions resulted in cases – and containment zones – increasing.While those in the IT sector and others could work from home, those in the trading sector were forced to open shops, which added to spike, a senior official in charge of containment zones said.“In areas like Chickpet, KR Market, Cottonpet, Vidhapeetha, Chamarajpet, Malleswaram, Jayanagar and VV Puram, commercial activities intensified immediately after the lockdown was eased,” the official said. “Social distancing became a big challenge. Traders aren’t the lone defaulters. Largely customers are to blame. They do not want to maintain social distancing and there are many incidents where they have violated rules and fought with retailers.”The central business district and areas in Bengaluru East, South and West are where the containment zones are.

409,['17/07/2020'],"Self-financing colleges begin admission process, government colleges to start by July 20","A large number of students and parents were seen waiting in front of colleges on Thursday

Coimbatore: Self-financing arts and science colleges in the city started admissions procedures in their own way after Class XII results were declared on Thursday.

While some colleges started admissions right after the results were announced, some opened online admission portals and others said they will prepare merit lists and inform candidates.

Large number of students and parents were seen waiting in front of colleges. A student, who was accompanied by her mother to a girls’ higher education institution in the city, said she had registered on the institution’s website and had come to submit her marksheet and community certificate.

Colleges such as the PSG College of Arts and Science had opened online admission process for CBSE students on Monday when the results were declared. They opened the portal for students of state board syllabus on Thursday. “We will receive applications, prepare merit list and based on the cut-off marks, admit students. It’s a transparent process,” said principal D Brindha.

Sri Krishna College of Arts and Science authorities said they had asked candidates to give their mark details and contact details in writing. “We will decide on the admission process and then contact them,” said K Sundararaman , chief executive officer of Sri Krishna Institutions.

However, the uncertainty caused by the lack of clear guidelines amid the pandemic and lockdown situation was evident in some colleges. As there were no clear instructions from the state government, they had no option but to start the admission process, said the principal of an arts and science college in the city. “We could not turn away the parents and students who approached us with marklists. So, we started admissions.”

Later in the day, the higher education department said the online application process for government arts and science colleges and government polytechnic colleges will start by July 20. Students have to apply through portal. For arts colleges it is www.tngasa.in and www.tndceonline.org, and for polytechnics www.tngptc.in and www.tngptc.com.

This is the first time the state follows a common admission portal for admission. Students can apply to any number of colleges, but only for three courses in each college.

There are 92,000 UG seats in 109 government arts colleges and 16,890 seats in 51 government polytechnic colleges under the department of higher education, and 3 constituent colleges under the department of industry and commerce.

The decision was taken at a meeting of Nepalese armed police SP Veer Singh Sahu and Champawat circle officer VC Pant at Tanakpur in Champawat district on Thursday. Sahu assured the Indian side that he would apprise his senior officials about the matter and take adequate steps.

On Wednesday, the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) had prevented a few Nepalese citizens from trying to plant saplings at Tanakpur along the Indo-Nepal border.

Meanwhile, the district administration said that pillar number 811 is missing from the area even as a joint team of Indian and Nepalese officials are scheduled to survey the area. The initiative was delayed due to the pandemic-induced lockdown. They added that the Nepalese also tried to stop the embankment works on Sharda river by the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation.

After the meeting on Thursday, SSB officials said that they would wait for the Nepalese side to take proper steps to resolve the issue, failing which they would decide on the further course of action.

A research team led by MS Santosh, associate professor, Centre for Incubation, Innovation, Research and Consultancy at Jyothy Institute of Technology has developed the indigenous device that uses the principle of electrolysis and produces hypochlorous acid (HOCI) — a well-known disinfectant solution that is used for sterilisation and pesticide removal — using tap water and common salt.

The device is portable and handy. It uses a rechargeable battery and can instantly generate the disinfectant solution through electrolysis. Using this device, people can spray the disinfectant solution on any surface and wipe it after five minutes.

The solution can also be used to wash vegetables, fruits, household and office items. As a hygiene product, the disinfectant solution when sprayed, sanitises the surroundings. The researchers are in the process of filing a provisional patent for their innovation and hope to bring the product to market soon at an affordable price.

“The price could be around Rs 2,000 if there are bulk orders. The investors have responded positively,” said Santosh.

The pass percentage has improved marginally from last year, while the district improving its position from last year, when it was ranked fourth.

A total of 32,874 students had appeared for the exams, of which 31,686 have passed. Girls outshone boys this year too, with 97.5% of girls and 94.98% of boys passing the exams.

Coimbatore chief education officer (CEO) P Usha said the performance of all students in schools across categories, and all students across groups has improved this year. As compared to 91 schools last year, this year 176 schools in the district have seen all their students pass the exams. Among these, seven are government schools as compared to the one government school which saw 100% results last year, she said.

Biochemistry, nursing general, communicative English, and home science papers recorded a 100% pass rate.

Coimbatore collector K Rajamani , in a release, said 1,469 students have scored 100% marks in at least one subject. This was 1,136 students more than the last year, he said. He congratulated school education officials, teachers, students, and parents who had worked for this.

This year, in Coimbatore, science group has seen 96.5% students pass, commerce group 97.13%, arts group 90.15%, and vocational group 90.01%.

Teachers and school representatives say, overall, arts group students have performed better than science students, and also the individual performances of science group students has dipped this year. They attribute this to the new syllabus.

A chemistry teacher from a government school from the district said, usually in the science group, students score 70% to 90% marks in science and math papers. “But this year, they have scored only 40% to 60%. While the overall pass percentage in science group is around 96% including all schools, there are more number of students who have failed in math and science in government schools. Students with less marks in science and math subjects would find it difficult to get admitted in professional courses or B.Sc courses,” said the teacher.

VILLUPURAM: Eight years after a casual conversation in a television reality show led to the unearthing of a triple murder , the Villupuram mahila court sentenced two brothers who had committed the murders to life imprisonment.

In 2008, the two brothers — carpenter E Murugan, 45, and truck driver Mathiarasan, 37 — first murdered a young couple, Lavanya, aged 16 then, and her husband Silambarasan, aged 20 then, and later murdered the girl’s father Sekar who came in search for her. All the three victims lay buried near a dilapidated well near the culprits’ house.

In 2012, however, Murugan’s daughter Bhargavi participated in a television reality show saying she had eloped with her boyfriend K Sathish Kumar and that they feared for their lives. It was when the host pointed out that she was only 17 years old and that she should return to her parental home, that Bhargavi revealed that her father would murder her. She remarked that her mother once told her that her father Murugan had murdered three people and buried them in their backyard.

This episode telecast on May 28, 2012, prompted Sekar’s wife to Jeeva to rush to police on May 31, and revive her four-year-old complaint that her husband Sekar and daughter Lavanya were missing. Police registered a case against four people — Murugan, his brother Mathiarasan, wife Rajeswari and an employee Murthi — on June 1, 2012.

They also dug up the bodies buried near the backyard of Murugan’s house. The case was tried before the Villupuram fast track Mahila court.

On Thursday, judge G Santhi found Murugan guilty of murder and sentenced him to serve three life imprisonments, concurrently, besides a fine of Rs 95,000. His brother Mathiarasan was convicted for one murder and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life besides paying Rs 35,000 as fine. While Murugan’s wife was acquitted of all charges, employee Murthi had died during the pendency of the case.

The worst part is all the victims and the offenders were known to each other. Murugan was running a furniture unit at Nallampillaipetral village near Gingee in Villupuram district, and he ran the business with his friend Sekar, whose daughter Lavanya was also working in the unit.

The teenager eloped with Silambarasan and married him. When she returned to Kuchipalayam village and sought Murugan’s help, he did oblige and accommodate the couple. According to the prosecution, however, he strangled the young couple and buried them near the hut. After a week, when Sekar came searching for his daughter, Murugan murdered him as well with the help of his brother Mathiarasan, and buried him, too.

Jeeva’s complaint to police about her missing husband Sekar and daughter Lavanya remained uncracked, till Bhargavi’s television show blew the lid off the mystery.

While the 19-year-old girl is getting ready to pursue her dream of becoming a chartered accountant, life was very different three years ago.

It was April 2017 and Suba was trying to decide which group to opt for in Class XI, when her parents told her that her father, a goldsmith, had faced heavy business losses. Unless she starts earning, they would not be able to feed the family of six, they told her. She was the oldest of the four siblings.

Her parents did not change their mind even after she scored a whopping 477 out of 500 in her Class X exams at the Town Hall Government School in Trichy. “I thought my life was over and I would remain a labourer earning a few thousands,” she told TOI. “I cried every night after seeing my friends return to school.”

After a year of quitting studies and working as a salesgirl in a textile showroom for Rs 5,000, it was Suba’s father’s friend who suggested putting her in KPR Mills, where she can work, earn the same salary and study.

Even though it meant staying in a hostel and away from her family, Suba proved her decision right when she matched her Class X score of 95%.

Returning to studies after a year’s break was not easy, Suba said. “The first six months of Class XI was difficult as I had lost touch with the subjects. I was also busy learning my work. But I remembered my family’s situation and was determined to change it. I believed that education and a better job is the only way to change my future. I slowly got into the groove and performed well in Class XII.”

“Though I missed centum in Commerce and Accounts, I am confident of clearing CA, which was my childhood dream,” she said.

Three months into her job in the textile mill, officers from the National Child Labour Project raided the factory and rescued Meena, along with other minors. An officer who rescued her told her she was meant to study at the age of 13 and not work.

“I was put in a Government school in Pooluvapatti in class eight in January, but NCLP officials kept teaching me Tamil and English, so I could slowly catch up,” said Meena. “Writing my Exams in English and language exams in Tamil despite coming from Andhra five years back is what makes me most proud.”

By the time she reached Class X, she was proficient enough in English. For Class XI and XII, she was shifted to the Jaivabai Municipal Girls Higher Secondary School in Tirupur town. “From there on, lessons were easy. I took commerce group,” said the daughter of a construction worker. Her mother works as a piece cutter.

Meena said she wants to get into the banking sector after completing her BCom degree. “My parents earn around Rs 15,000 a month. I want to provide them better housing, more affordability and comfort. I will not rest until I do it,” she said.

424,['17/07/2020'],"Tirupur records 97.12% pass, outshines other districts","COIMBATORE: Tirupur recorded the highest pass percentage in the Class XII board exams in the state for the second time in a row, this time bettering its performance by 1.75% to 97.12%, from 95.37% last year.

The science stream saw the highest pass percentage of 98.21%, followed by the commerce stream (97.46%), arts group (91.61%) and the vocation stream (85%). The education department attributed the success rate to the motivation that it received from the last year’s results and constant counselling of students.

Of the 23,398 students, who appeared for the exam in the district, 22,724 have passed. Girls continued to outshine boys with a pass percentage of 98.04%, compared to the latter’s 95.98%.

The education department was also delighted at the performance of differently-abled candidates. Ramesh, chief education officer, said, “Despite challenges, they performed splendidly, with 60 of the 62 students clearing the exams.”

Students in the district managed to achieve 100% pass in eight of the 25 subjects, including business mathematics , home science, geography, biochemistry and microbiology . English and mathematics had a pass percentage of more than 98%.

At least 111 schools – nine government schools, one municipal school, four aided schools, eight self-finance schools and 89 matric schools – in the district managed to achieve 100% result.

According to the chief education officer, it was the combined efforts of schools and students that contributed to the better pass percentage. “Teachers wanted to retain the top position this year too. But besides that, what we think that made the difference was making students understand the importance of education and how much it could change their future. We spent a lot of time motivating students and teachers. We conducted workshops on adopting a positive approach and students started enjoying studies, instead of dreading exams.”

BENGALURU: Karnataka has significantly increased its daily testing numbers from about 14,000 on average in June-end to 21,000 now. On Wednesday, the state tested 24,500 samples, the highest so far.

However, Karnataka has the lowest testing rate among 29 states and seven UTs, an analysis of available data shows. Karnataka conducted 13,022 tests per million till Tuesday, the day when it overtook Gujarat to become the state with the fourth highest caseload.

Karnataka has tested above 8.2 lakh people since March, while major states have touched the 15 lakh mark. Analysis shows worst-hit states like Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Rajasthan, with comparative populations, are testing significantly higher numbers.

""A lag in testing leads to more cases, which results in need for even more tests to finally get a handle on the pandemic. We’ve been playing catch-up from the beginning and, experts say, we are still nowhere close to narrowing the gap,’’ admitted a senior health department official, who is part of the state Covid taskforce.

Public health experts have been stressing on enhanced testing to detect positive cases. They say poor testing could worsen the situation. Health department officials say they aim to test 30,000 samples a day by the month-end.

""Though the state has increased its testing capacity in the last two weeks, it is unlikely to be enough as more positive cases are being diagnosed. We need to test at least about 30,000 people every day. That’s our target now,’’ said Dr CN Manjunath, nodal officer for Covid-19 testing in the state.

In mid-March, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) sent a clear message to all states: test, test, and test. The more tests conducted, the easier it becomes to track the spread of the virus and reduce transmission. Many states followed the advice, identifying more number of cases at an earlier stage, isolating infected individuals and limiting the virus spread.

However, Karnataka failed to pay heed to the early advice from ICMR. Today, many infections are going undetected, with the state now recording the fastest growth rate in corona count.

On the other hand, Delhi, which saw a massive spike in the number of coronavirus cases about three weeks ago, got its act together. It significantly increased testing capacity and also improved contact tracing. Today, it is showing the fastest improvement rate nationally.

""When the positivity rate is less than 5%, it means you are properly testing the sickest of the sick. The government has promised to accomplish this and if it does, it will be a huge relief,’’ said Dr Giridhara Babu, epidemiologist and member Karnataka Covid taskforce. Some experts also warn that the government should resolve testing-related issues before the second wave of coronavirus hits the state (in September-October).

AHMEDABAD: A 38-year-old woman who lives near Geeta Mandir and has two children, lodged a complaint at Kagdapith police station on Wednesday against one Kamlesh Chavda, a resident of Behrampura, for stabbing her near Bhulabhai Park, on July 13.

The woman stated in the FIR that the accused wanted a relationship with her and when she refused, he stabbed her in the stomach. She stated that he threatened to kill her if she told anyone at her home.

Inspector M A Singh of Kagdapith police station said that they lodged an offence against the accused, detained him and sent him for a pre-arrest Covid test.

According to the FIR, during the lockdown in March, she had wanted to recharge her mobile phone and had gone towards Behrampura. She saw a man there and asked him if there was a mobile shop around. The man, Kamlesh Chavda, instead recharged her phone using his PayTM account,” said a police official.

“Chavda later started calling her and continued doing so even when she told him not to. Later, whenever she left home for work, he would follow her,” a police source said.

The woman stated that a month and a half ago, when she was near Bhulabhai Park, Chavda came there and professed his love for her. She turned him down saying she has two children. He got angry, abused her and took out a shaving blade and slashed his own hands.

The FIR states that at about 12.30pm on July 13, when she was near Bhulabhai Park, Chavda stopped her. He grabbed both her hands and stabbed her with a knife on the left side of her stomach. He threatened her and warned her to keep her mouth shut.

“She first went to a doctor, who administered two stitches on her and went home. As her pain increased, her brother first took her to a doctor and then shifted her to LG Hospital on Tuesday. The doctor operated on her as he had suffered an injury to her intestine. She lodged a complaint against Chavda from there,” said Inspector MA Singh of Kagdapith police station.

Irrigation officials said both districts recorded average rainfall of 300 mm in the last 24 hours. The IMD, Mumbai, had on Wednesday forecast heavy to very heavy rain in the two districts while issuing an orange alert for Mumbai. Discharge from Almatti dam in Karnataka was around 46,000 cusec, around 1,450 cusec from Radhanagari dam in Kolhapur district and 2,222 cusec from Koyna dam in Satara district.

The water level in the Panchganga river increased to 19 feet, a rise of around three feet. The water level in the Krishna river in Sangli district was 10 feet by Thursday. Six barrages along the Panchganga river and three along other rivers have gone under water.

Meanwhile, the highways in the two districts have been closed as they were inundated following the heavy rain. As part of measures to tackle flooding, two teams of the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) have begun preparations for emergency situation. The standard operating procedure (SOP)to carry out rescue amid the Covid pandemic has been drafted for NDRF jawans.

“As per the new SOP, we will carry out rescue operations with personal protective kits, masks and face shields. We have to keep our jawans safe from Covid,” Nitesh Kumar , head of the teams sent to Kolhapur district, said. “We are in constant touch with the local authorities for directions.

While many intend to increase the sum insured and are seeking top-up coverage for Covid-19, there are corporates who are making changes in the policy terms and conditions, such as not covering parents or altering benefit to reduce premium outgo.“Companies would be hesitant to reduce the sum insured because it directly impacts what one is conveying to employees. A lot of companies cover spouse, children and parents. The first thing they would cut is parents’ cover because the cost is almost 3.5x to 4x of covering spouse and children. Companies are telling employees that if you want your parents covered, you can pay extra for them,” said Abhishek Poddar , co-founder & CEO, Plum, a Bengaluru-based startup that offers group health cover to over 120 companies. Poddar also pointed out that in group policies, companies are also looking at changing benefits such as room rent restrictions, capping cost of treatment for diseases or maternity benefits to reduce their premium outgo.ICICI Lombard chief Sanjay Datta said some corporates want to pay their premium in instalments as there is a pressure on cash flows now. Post Covid , the government has been pushing corporates to ensure they offer health cover to employees. Shanai Ghosh, executive director & CEO, Edelweiss General Insurance said there is increased awareness and demand for group health cover by SMEs and large corporates looking for fixed benefit cover for Covid-19, along with the normal medical policy.“‘Company paid Top-ups’ for employees, is gaining popularity as a solution. There is also increasing demand for sum insured enhancement and reinstatement covers by organizations that already have health coverage for employees. There is also rising demand for HospiCash benefit (fixed allowance per day of hospitalization), home quarantine cover, 100% coverage of PPE kit costs and tele-consultations,” she added.Star Health and Allied Insurance MD Anand Roy said that apart from sectors like hospitality and education, who are either postponing renewal or are reducing cover, there is growing demand from all the other sectors, which would boost overall group health segment in coming days. “While group health insurance is witnessing robust growth, this may be hidden given decline in loan protection linked insurance. Loan protection linked insurance, which is also reported under health insurance, has taken a hit due to current challenges in the credit market. Furthermore, retail health insurance is also witnessing robust growth. Therefore, while contribution of group health to total health portfolio may not change, it could show increase as a percentage of non-life market,” Ghosh said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77011528,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-115942,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/firms-renegotiating-group-health-covers-with-insurers/articleshow/77008627.cms

438,['17/07/2020'],"Coronavirus in Chennai: R-value below one, coronavirus no more an epidemic in Chennai: Maths model","CHENNAI: As fresh cases of Covid-19 slowly drop in Chennai Thursday’s number was 1,157 a mathematical model suggests the infection is no more an epidemic in the city.The R-value or effective reproduction number for Chennai has fallen below one at 0.78 +/- 0.02 for the period July 10-14, indicating the outbreak may have been contained, says Sitabhra Sinha, professor at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences. The R-value stands for the number of people one person can infect. An epidemic is considered to be on the wane when its R-value falls below one.“Technically, it is no longer an epidemic in the city. If Chennai manages to prevent any new clusters from increasing the growth rate again, we could end up with all patients recovered by a couple of weeks. However, there may still be isolated cases but not an epidemic, which is an exponential growth of case numbers,” he said.In contrast to Chennai, Madurai’s R-value for July 4 to 9 stood at 1.41 +/-0.04 as the infection surge in southern Tamil Nadu continued. The region recorded 1,256 of the state’s total of 4,549 cases and 14 of the 69 deaths reported on Thursday. After 5,106 patients were discharged, the state now has 46,714 active cases, including 15,038 in Chennai.Sinha warned that “There have been occasions in the past when R was brought down below 1 only for it to bounce back again to large values later as new cases came and started spreading,” he added. Earlier around May 19, the R-value for Chennai was one, but it has not fallen below that until July 4 when the daily active cases in the city fell below 2,000 cases.Virologist Dr T Jacob John said while the R-value below one indicates that Chennai has crossed the peak, the epidemic is not over until the cases touch hundred every day. But if people continue to wear masks and follow other safety precautions, Dr John said the cases could drop to a few hundreds in two weeks. “R-value is less than one because the numbers are coming down. But this is no time to relax. We are still on the downslope of the epidemic. Until the cases come down to a 100 or 200, it is still an epidemic. I think in about two weeks-time the numbers could be in hundreds,” he said.“The cases in the state will go up till August second week before they see a decline like Chennai,” he added. T Sundararaman, public health expert and former dean of school of health systems studies, TISS said “The problem now is that districts have slackened and we have large clusters.

According to forest department sources, they rescued nine pythons from human habitations between April and June this year.

The Indian Rock Pythons rescued from here were eight to 12 feet long, they said.

“After we rescue a python, we release it in the adjoining forest. We cannot release the python in a far-off forest as there is a chance that the reptile may not survive in another habitat,” said Patel.

The construction work of Jaimal Road was supposed to start on February 13, 2020, but till date no work has been done. Instead the road has been dug up from both ends, obstructing the movement of traffic over it.

There are 124 shops and establishments on both sides of the road, and the business activities have come to a standstill as there is no movement of traffic on the dilapidated road. Yet to recover from the two month-long lockdown, the shopkeepers who have faced huge losses are unable to earn even now due to no road.

“We have requested the city mayor, Balkar Singh Sidhu, to get the work completed within 15 days, otherwise the whole market will protest against the Ludhiana administration,” said Gurmeet Singh Kular, incharge, Atam Nagar constituency (Shiromani Akali Dal) and senior vice-president, industry and trade wing, Shiromani Akali Dal.

The government said in a statement that it is fully committed to observing and respecting the LAC and that any unilateral attempt to change the status quo along it is not acceptable.

The disengagement process currently under way in the western sector is specifically aimed at addressing “face-off situations and close-up deployments of troops” along the LAC, said the external affairs ministry . “It is based on an understanding between senior military commanders . Both sides have agreed at specific points to re-deploy towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava .

Refuting allegations that India’s position had changed, the official said the process of disengagement along the LAC is complex and so “unsubstantiated and inaccurate” reports need to be avoided.

The official recalled that India and China have been engaged in discussions through established diplomatic and military channels to address the situation along the LAC in the border areas.

The Special Representatives of India and China on the Boundary Question — Ajit Doval and Wang Yi respectively — had discussed the situation on July 5. A meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs was also held on July 10.

“In these meetings, the two sides have agreed on complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC and de-escalation from India-China border areas for full restoration of peace and tranquility in the border areas in accordance with bilateral agreements and protocols,” said the official.

While the overall pass percentage was 92.3%, Tirupur district topped the list with 97.12 % pass. Erode came second with 96.99% and Chennai district secured 15th position with 93.45% pass.According to teachers, the less-than-expected show by state board students may usher in a windfall for CBSE stream students who may pocket most seats in top engineering and veterinary colleges in the state due to their high marks.While at least 1,000 CBSE students may have scored more than 95% in Tamil Nadu, fewer than 100 students would have crossed that score in state board this year, experts said.State board science students have particularly scored fewer marks in maths and physics this year. A city teacher blamed tougher physics paper for the low scores. “Though the paper was tough, we could not understand the unusually low score in maths and physics,” said another teacher. “We have centums only in computer science, accountancy and commerce. Though there were fewer centums last year, the students generally scored high marks,” said V Shanthi, headmistress of Vidyodaya Girls Higher Secondary School, T Nagar.Out of 120 students in our school, 21 students got above 95% marks and most of them are commerce students. “Usually, science students get more marks but this year it was the other way round,” she said, adding that many students were contemplating applying for revaluation.“This is the first set facing exam under the revised syllabus. Our teachers and students were not trained for application-oriented questions. Science students scored at least 20% fewer marks than expected. Commerce students got more marks compared to science students,” said R Rajkumar, headmaster, DRBCCC Higher Secondary School, Perambur.“Due to the higher-order-thinking questions, scores have come down in all schools in science stream. There are no high scores across schools in TN,” he said.Due to practical marks, students have got respectable scores. “When we look at only the theory marks, they have scored even lesser marks,” Rajkumar said, adding that the results would further dissuade students from taking science stream in Class XIl.”Competition will be very tough and CBSE students will get more admission to top colleges compared to last year,” said P Swaminathan, secretary, SRV Schools in Trichy and Namakkal.But, B Purushothaman, senior principal of Everwin Group of Schools said the results may help state board students in the long run. “It is the role reversal for CBSE schools and state board schools this year,” he added. Career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi said though the pass percentage is high the number of high scores are less among state board students. “Number of students scoring above 95% has come down in the state board and CBSE students will have advantage in getting admission to premier colleges like Anna University and PSG College of Technology,” he said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77010148,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-203222,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/marks-tumble-in-class-xii-more-cbse-kids-may-get-top-engg-seats/articleshow/77008640.cms

Though entry into the forest and gathering of katarua is prohibited, rules are broken every year. This time, PTR's deputy director Naveen Khandelwal ordered distribution of pamphlets in the villages, warning of stringent action, including a three-year jail term, in case of their intrusion into the protected forest and collection of any forest produce.

For the villagers,

the katarua buds means money. Sal trees dominate PTR forest. The buds develop only during monsoon. They grow at the base of the tree, so it is easy to cut.

The buds are gathered and openly sold in the city. At present, wholesalers at the mandi here are selling it for Rs 700 a kg.

The wild mushrooms are usually consumed by villagers themselves as there are few takers for it in the city.

Last year, a villagers were arrested for collecting and selling

katarua buds but they were let off after they paid a paltry Rs 50 as fine.

According to Moradabad police, the accused is a local resident, who holds a licence to run slaughtering business, however, “the act was illegal because it took place at a public place, which happened to be a hotspot zone as well”.

An FIR was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act.

Galshaheed police station SHO Ajeet Roria said, “Accused Anees Qureshi, a local butcher, told police that he was forced to bring meat in a car from a supplier, as there was no other vehicle available. As soon as he reached the shop in Indira Chowk area and began unloading the meat, a few locals started making the video, he said. A probe has been ordered into the matter.”

“The accused is a licensed butcher. However, legal action has been initiated as a large quantity of meat was being unloaded in full public view in the area under Galshaheed police station, which is a containment zone. He was booked under section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 188 (disobedience of order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC, section 3 (penalty - any person disobeying any regulation or order made under this Act shall be deemed to have committed an offence punishable under section 188 of the IPC) of the Epidemic Diseases Act and section 51B (refuses to comply with any direction given by or on behalf of the government) of the Disaster Management Act.”

449,['17/07/2020'],"Bizmen look up to state govt, Centre for lower rate for power across country","Ludhiana: Disturbed over shrinking incomes and rising expenditures, businessmen are looking towards both state and central governments for taking steps to ensure that the industry gets back on the path of progress. According to businessmen, the immediate step which the governments can take right now is lower the power rates and fix them at a flat rate of Rs 3 per unit all across the nation and if this happens they can even topple China in terms of industrial production.

Speaking to TOI, Upkar Singh Ahuja , president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), said, “Power is a major contributor in the expenditure of the industry, be it of any type, and it should be one rate nationwide. If you see the example of China the power there is at a flat rate of Rs 3 all across the nation for the industry. The flat rate is the major deciding factor in the cost of production and the final rate of the product. If the rates are nominal and same all over India for the industry, it will not only create a level playing field for the industry all over the country but will also lower our cost of production significantly to such levels that we will easily be able to have an edge in exports as well and topple countries like China easily at the global level.”

According to Narinder Bhamra, president of Fasteners Manufacturers Association of India, “Lowering the rate of power is the need of the hour in Punjab, particularly in the wake of the ongoing situation due to Covid-19 as industry’s profits have shrunk to record levels and expenditures have shot off manifold. Right now, we are paying a very huge cost of power and rates for majority of the industry are as high as Rs 8-Rs 10, which are the highest in the country. The rates should not exceed Rs 5 per unit in any case and if the state government reduces the rates, the industry will be able to bounce back at the earliest. Moreover, the central government should make sure that the power rates for the industry are same in all states as this will stop undue advantage to industries located in some states and all states will prosper equally.”

Sahil Suneja, a packing boxes manufacturer, “Electricity is like a raw material for the industry and it is the major deciding factor in determining the cost of our products. So, higher the rate of power, higher our cost of production and higher the final rate of our products. High rate of power has been pinching us for years now and now in the wake of rising losses due to Covid-9 the situation has deteriorated. So, it will be in the best interest of Punjab’s industry if the rates of power are reduced and moreover, the rates of power should be kept flat all over India.”

The yellowish-brown Dudhwa Tree Frog (Chirixalus dudhwaensis) has only been spotted intermittently since its discovery in 1992 in Dudhwa. The semi-arboreal (inhabiting trees) species is found in marshy areas or swamps.

Sanjay Pathak, field director of Dudhwa who spotted and clicked the species, told TOI that the sighting of the frog was very rare. “Not much is known about the species so it is listed as ‘Data Deficient’ in the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN)’s red list of endangered species.”

Pathak said that fresh sightings have sparked hope of studies on the species. “Last year we had to cancel the survey of the species since no sightings could be made. But now we will conduct a survey to identify areas where the frog is present and estimate the total number of individuals in Dudhwa,” he said.

Dr Mudit Gupta, state coordinator of WWF-India, told TOI, “Sighting of this tree frog is indeed encouraging news. Dudhwa is a productive Terai habitat and home to many such unique wild species. With the use of M-STrIPES patrolling program, field staff of Dudhwa is able to record their observations and more such exciting findings are on their way.”

BAREILLY: A rare and “shy” frog species named after Dudhwa Tiger reserve — after it was discovered in the area in the 1990s — has been spotted twice this monsoon, sparking hope of a census to estimate the species’ population and habitat details for the first time.

The yellowish-brown Dudhwa Tree Frog (Chirixalus dudhwaensis) has only been spotted intermittently since its discovery in 1992 in Dudhwa. The semi-arboreal (inhabiting trees) species is found in marshy areas or swamps.

Sanjay Pathak, field director of Dudhwa who spotted and clicked the species, told TOI that the sighting of the frog was very rare. “Not much is known about the species so it is listed as ‘Data Deficient’ in the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN)’s red list of endangered species.”

Pathak said that fresh sightings have sparked hope of studies on the species. “Last year we had to cancel the survey of the species since no sightings could be made. But now we will conduct a survey to identify areas where the frog is present and estimate the total number of individuals in Dudhwa,” he said.

Dr Mudit Gupta, state coordinator of WWF-India, told TOI, “Sighting of this tree frog is indeed encouraging news. Dudhwa is a productive Terai habitat and home to many such unique wild species. With the use of M-STrIPES patrolling program, field staff of Dudhwa is able to record their observations and more such exciting findings are on their way.”

454,['17/07/2020'],Cyient Ltd Q1FY21 PAT down 10%,"Hyderabad: Global engineering and technology solutions player Cyient on Thursday said it has posted a 10% drop in profit after tax (PAT) for the first quarter ended June 30, 2020, at Rs 81.4 crore as against Rs 90.5 crore in the first quarter of 2019-20. This was on a nearly 9% decline in consolidated revenue for Q1FY21 at Rs 991.7 crore from Rs 1089 crore in Q1FY20. However on a QoQ basis, PAT grew 8% from Rs 75.4 crore in Q4FY20 to Rs 81.4 crore in Q1FY21 despite a 7.6% de-growth in consolidated revenue from Rs 1073.6 crore in Q4FY20 to Rs 991.7 crore in Q2FY21.

The company said that during the quarter, it commissioned its new DLM (design-led manufacturing) electronics manufacturing factory at the Hyderabad Airport SEZ. Spread over 10 acres with a built-up area of 1.5 lakh sft, the factory will commence production from August 2020 with a headcount of over 100 employees by July end and over 500 employees by March 2021.

The company said it is also diversifying its customer base and added 25 new customers during the quarter, including Hitachi Rail.

Pointing out that the results were better than expectations, despite the lower revenues, Cyient MD & CEO Krishna Bodanapu said: “Services business was lower by 14.3% QoQ in constant currency. The DLM business grew by 8.5% QoQ. We expect traction from top clients to return post Q2. The EBIT margin is lower by 328bps QoQ mainly due to lower business volume, which was somewhat offset by lower SG&A spend. We generated free cash flow (FCF) of Rs 2,16.3 crore which was higher by 101% QoQ.”

Ajay Aggarwal, president & CFO, said the “…With significant efforts spent on efficiencies and cost optimisation in the last financial year, our focus on cost reduction and profit improvement continued in Q1 and is set to show results in the coming quarters.”

456,['17/07/2020'],9 years after court orders LIT gets possession of land,"Ludhiana: The Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) officials were able to take possession of a prime property in block A of Kitchlu Nagar on Thursday. They had been trying to get the possession of this property since 2011 as despite court orders the occupants were not ready to leave the plot. The officials claimed that it was a prime piece of land and they would be able to generate revenue from the auction of this property.

The officials had been fighting for the possession of 765 sq yrds located in a corner of Kitchlu Nagar. A court case was going on in which the court had ordered those concerned to hand over the possession to LIT in 2011, but the occupants kept on delaying the same for one reason or the other. It made LIT officials to file contempt petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court and even there the court asked the occupants why they were not handing over the possession to LIT.

The SDO of LIT, Kirandeep Heer, said, “We have been trying for a long time for this land but the occupants were delaying the possession with one or other reason. Even on Thursday, they showed little bit resentment but we did not let them disturb the drive.”

He said LIT had acquired land for developing Kitchlu Nagar scheme and at that time, possession of this land was not given to the department and it kept on delaying. He further claimed that they had dismantled the boundary wall around the land and now they would construct their own boundary wall and then plots would be auctioned to the public.

Meanwhile, sources revealed that LIT officials also noticed that the gates installed in the colony had been locked. The officials claimed that they had handed over the colony to the civic body for maintenance, so now they would write to the MC officials for removing these gates from here. The officials claimed that they would construct a boundary wall and they would require a way to move in and out, but due to the closed gates it was becoming difficult.

457,['17/07/2020'],Varun Gandhi’s advice on PTR’s man-tiger conflict inspires UP forest officials to adopt new measures,"PILIBHIT: BJP leader Varun Gandhi on Wednesday spoke to principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) of UP, Sunil Pandey, and field director of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR), H Rajamohan via video conferencing, advising them about measures to mitigate man-tiger conflict in rural areas in the proximity of PTR. At the end of the meeting, the top forest officials agreed to adopt the suggestions advised by the Pilibhit MP .

The most crucial issue Gandhi raised was translocation of the Amaria tigers and other PTR tigers considered excess to the forest, to other forest areas of the country that have low density of big cats.

Talking to TOI on the matter, Pandey said Gandhi had also emphasised the need to set up re-wilding enclosures inside PTR, in addition to ensuring availability of veterinary facility to carry out diagnosis and treatment of injured and sick wildlife.

“We have already requested Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to precisely calculate the total number of tigers PTR can accommodate on the basis of its geographical area, as well as availability, density and distribution of its prey base. This will help assess the number of tigers in PTR that need to be relocated,” Pandey said.

“As translocation of PTR tigers involves identification of suitable alternative forest regions that have basic amenities like safe wildlife hideouts, adequate grasslands, prey base and drinking water, as well as a climate similar to the Terai, WII’s tiger cell has also been urged to identify such wild areas as soon as possible,” he added.

Practical action would only be possible after the department receives the report, Pandey further added.

In case of the Amaria tigers — which are known to have developed a familiarity with human presence, especially in agricultural fields — a supplementary need of the translocation process would be re-wilding enclosures. These tigers would first need to be lodged in the re-wilding enclosures for a considerable period of time, to make them fully adapt to the wild, before they are translocated, he explained.

For this, the forest administration has already identified two spots of three hectares each in the Mahof forest range, which would be converted into re-wilding enclosures after National Tiger Conservation Authority’s (NTCA) approval — currently under negotiation — is extended, he continued.

“For expert technical support, we’ll coordinate with Kanha Tiger Reserve authorities in Madhya Pradesh, where re-wilding enclosures were successfully serving their basic purpose,” Pandey also said.

Regarding setting up of a veterinary facility in PTR, he said, “I’ve directed PTR field director H Rajamohan to spare two rooms at Mustafabad forest guest house for the purpose. We’ll file a requisition for necessary medical equipment, medicines, kits, etc., apart from appointing experienced vets who would be given proper training to deal with wildlife,” said PCCF.

Rajamohan said following Gandhi’s suggestion, he’ll chalk out an action plan for cultivation of herbs and aromatic plants in fields just outside PTR’s periphery.

“To make the plan a success, we’ll seek active participation of district agriculture department, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) and the district administration, for technical assistance, promotion of new cropping patterns among farmers and exploring markets to procure the produce,” Rajamohan said.

BOKARO: Bokaro General Hospital (BGH), the only treatment centre for Covid-19 patients in the district, has asked the governmentt to install a TrueNat testing machine at the hospital to overcome the delay in getting test reports from sadar hospital, which has three such machines. BGH officials said the delay in getting Covid reports is leading to delay in providing treatment to non-Covid patients.

A BGH official said, “Treating suspected Covid patients without their test report is risky for everyone, including doctors and other healthcare staff. The BGH management is trying to install an RT-PCR machine with the help from the district administration but that project is getting delayed. TrueNat machines are the need of the hour.”

In several departments like neurosurgery, burns, gynaecology, cardiology, orthopaedics and others, BGH is regularly getting critical Covid-19 patients. Another hospital staff said, “In case of emergencies, it is not feasible to wait for a Covid-19 test report. But in such cases, who will take the responsibility if anything happens to the patient?”

Till Thursday morning, Bokaro had 93 virus cases of which 46 are active and two have died.

Bokaro civil surgeon Dr A K Pathak said, “I have forwarded BGH’s request to the health department since the decision to allot TrueNat machines lies with them.” State health secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni said the department will consider BGH’s request. He added, “We will soon make provisions to install a TrueNat machines at BGH.”

The health department has, so far, installed 72 Truenat machines across the state, including three at sadar hospital in Bokaro. In addition, the department has set up five RT-PCR testing laboratories for Covid-19 tests across Jharkhand.

459,['17/07/2020'],Vacant plots of Partap Singh Wala become garbage dumps,"Ludhiana: When on one hand emphasis is being laid on the fact that proper hygiene should be maintained in the surroundings during monsoon and also because of coronavirus, certain vacant plots in Partap Singh Wala near Govind Godham are covered with heaps of garbage, leading to foul smell in the locality.

Residents of nearby colonies claimed that garbage collectors collect waste from various localities and dump it at these plots instead of throwing at any designated place. Besides, many other people find it convenient to throw garbage of their households during night on these plots.

A resident of Partap Singh Wala, Karamjit Singh, said, “First of all heaps of garbage are an eye sore and secondly the foul smell spreads in the entire locality, especially when it rains. There is nobody to take care of these things and despite our complaints nobody takes care of the situation.” He said it had become difficult to stay here.

Another resident of Hambran Road Kamal Sharma claimed that he was regular visitor to the Govind Godham and passing through this small stretch becomes a test for him. He said at a time when the country was talking about 100% garbage lifting and source segregation, then why these vacant plots were still full of garbage. He said the authorities should pay attention towards this problem as it could lead to some serious problem. He added that due to heaps of garbage even stray cattle were gathering here and they could also create problems for the residents as well as commuters.

Meanwhile, SD Dhamija from Govind Godham said, “This has become a normal affair as whenever there is some function or some festival in the temple we have to get it cleared at our expenses or else residents collect money and get it cleaned even as the authorities prefer to sleep over the same.” He said he had conveyed the issue to sarpanch several times but even he was not sincere towards the issues of residents.

However, Congress MLA Kuldeep Singh said, “Though it is not my job to get the garbage lifted as a sarpanch has been elected for that village, I had come to know about the problem so I have asked the officials concerned to look into the matter and get it cleared.”

He said earlier also a similar problem had aroused when the MC had refused to allow garbage of villages to the secondary garbage collection points. Singh said then he had intervened and got the issue resolved. He said the problem would resolve shortly.

The officer-in-charge of Mayurhund police station, Rupesh Mahto ,said, “Cases of land disputes have increased all of a sudden following the return of migrants .”The lockdown and loss of jobs have forced tens of thousands of migrants workers to return to their villages and the limited economic opportunities that had driven the workers’ exodus from parts of the country over the years have shrunk further in lockdown. In Jharkhand , unemployment went from 8.2% to 59.2% between March and May, before making some recovery to 21% in June. As the number of jobs dips, that of property claimants has grown.Karun Singh, from Pratappur village under Mayurhund police station, was working in Mumbai for many years, but was forced to return to his village in Chatra after he lost his job in the city. Upon his return, Karun found that his uncle had allegedly sold off his share of their ancestral property without intimating him.A village head on the condition of anonymity said, “Many people from Chatra work in bigger cities. Their sudden return and decision to live here have made their relatives agitated. The latter were so far looking after the agricultural plots of the migrants and treating those parcels of land as their personal property.” He confirmed that many have sold property without taking consent of the actual owner.Similarly, in Manhe, the sons of two brothers reached home from Mumbai during the lockdown and got into a legal battle over the family land and the matter landed at the police station.Police said often disagreements over property are resulting in legal battles between family members and many migrants who have returned home after several years away have discovered that their relatives — who were given the responsibility to look after their property — have sold off their portion of the land.An elderly man in the village said, “In most cases, when people leave the village, it is assumed they will make their own living and will have no active role or share in family landholdings.

The survey’s second round, conducted across 10 districts in June, put the prevalence rate at 0.63%.Sero-survey is a process to determine whether a person has been infected by the coronavirus in the recent past by testing his blood samples. Conducted among random individuals in a population, the survey was conducted by Elisa antibody test, the department said.Ranchi, which has 565 cases among the state’s 4,546 cases so far, has the highest prevalence rate (2.4%).

Speaking to TOI, Alam said: “As the Congress legislative party leader, I can vouch that our party is intact.” Alam, however, did not comment on the Jharkhand Congress chief Rameshwar Oraon’s Wednesday’s claims that the saffron party is trying to bring six Congress MLAs to its fold.

Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, Oraon had said BJP was trying to disrupt the coalition government of JMM, Congress and RJD after being defeated in the 2019 state assembly polls.

Referring to former deputy CM of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot’s revolt against CM Ashok Gehlot, Oraon had said: “Similar efforts are being made in Jharkhand and (MLAs) were offered money and posts in order to help (BJP) form the government here. Such efforts were also made in the recent Rajya Sabha elections (on June 19). But the MLAs of the mahagatbandhan are in a flock and united.” Oraon however did not reveal the names of the Congress legislators who were approached by the BJP.

On Wednesday, BJP’s Jharkhand chief Deepak Prakash had rubbished Oraon’s allegation. “Congress does not trust its own MLAs and it has to bring its house in order. The government has failed to fulfil every promises it made to the people and now it is now making such statements to mask its failures,” Prakash had said.

In the 81-member house, the ruling coalition has 48 MLAs -- JMM 29, Congress 15, JVM-P two and RJD and NCP one each. BJP has 25 MLAs while it enjoys the support of Ajsu party (two MLAs), JVM-P (1) and two independents.

Oraon’s remarks created confusion among Congress rank and file on Wednesday. Its working president and Jamtara MLA Irfan Ansari stressed that Oraon must name the legislators to maintain transparency and confusion among the lawmakers.

On July 14, Ansari had put out a cryptic tweet tagging former AICC chief Rahul Gandhi and AICC’s Jharkhand in-charge RPN Singh stating: “Lies and flattery would have taken me across oceans. But the habit of speaking truth led to my downfall.”

467,['17/07/2020'],"BJP delegation meets Murmu, seeks justice for Godda MP","Ranchi: A two-member BJP delegation, comprising state general secretary Pradeep Verma and Bokaro MLA Biranchi Narayan, on Thursday submitted a memorandum to governor Droupadi Murmu, accusing Hemant Soren government of political vendetta against Godda MP Nishikant Dubey.

Last week, one Vishnu Kant Jha, a resident of Bampass road in Deoghar, had filed an FIR at a local police station against Dubey and his wife Anamika Gautam, accusing the two of forging government documents to lower the price of a plot of land in the district, which the couple had bought last year, thereby, duping the state exchequer of its revenue.

Both Verma and Narayan,in their memorandum to Murmu,said, “The complainant is a former BJP member who was removed owing to his criminal antecedents. Our MP is neither a vendor nor the purchaser of the said land. He has been falsely implicated by the complainant for political reasons at the behest of the Hemant Soren-led government.”

The memorandum further said that Hemant is using his political might to harass Dubey as the latter has been a strong critic of the wrongdoings of his government. “We request the governor to intervene and provide justice to our MP and his family,” the two BJP functionaries said in the memorandum.

Congress, which is a part of ruling alliance in Jharkhand, dared Dubey to face the due process of law. Party spokesperson Alok Dubey said, “The government and the police are doing their job on the basis of a complaint filed against the Godda MP. As a responsible lawmaker, Dubey should face the legal battle and come clean.”

The decision was taken during a meeting of functionaries of the associations at the IMA Bhavan. During the meeting, many private hospital owners said they are ready to hand over their healthcare centres to the government to tackle the shortage of beds for Covid-19 patients.

IMA state secretary Dr Pradeep Singh said, “We request the state government to increase designated Covid-19 hospitals so that we can prevent the spread of infection to other patients. We also request for arrangements for more isolation beds across the state.”

Singh also stressed that the government should make use of the Covid-19 wards modified from train coaches by railways and the hospitals run by PSUs, if required. Various other associations said they are ready to offer their employees in the fight, if the government agrees to provide insurance cover to them. Jharkhand women wing president of IMA, Dr Bharti Kashyap, said, “We have decided that if any of our health workers treat Covid patients, they must be provided an insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh.”

469,['17/07/2020'],"Monsoon session of assembly unlikely any time soon, says Cong’s Alamgir","Ranchi: The Hemant Soren-led government is unlikely to convene the monsoon session of Jharkhand assembly any time soon owing to the spike in Covid-19 infections in the state.

Speaking to TOI on Thursday, state minister for parliamentary affairs Alamgir Alam said holding the session will mean exposing a lot of people, including ministers, lawmakers, politicians, bureaucrats, government employees, assembly secretariat personnel, police personnel and the common people, to the risk of contracting the virus.

He said, “This is a risk the government is unwilling to take at this point. A formal discussion with the CM is yet to be held on this matter as the whole government machinery is busy tackling the spread of the virus.” As on Thursday morning, Jharkhand had recorded 4,576 positive cases and 38 deaths. The state has 2,053 active cases and close to 2,500 recoveries.

The monsoon session is held traditionally between July-August each year. This year, the Budget session, the first of the mahagathbandhan government, was adjourned on March 24, five days before its scheduled closure. The spread of the infection among lawmakers has also come as a concern for the government with JMM MLA Mathura Prasad Mahto and state water resources minister Mithilesh Kumar Thakur testing positive recently.

Alam said the government is looking at the other states. “The Parliament, which sees business for more than 200 days a year, has remained closed for four months. How can we take the risk (of resuming assembly work)?” he questioned.

Assembly speaker Rabindranath Mahto, however, said the monsoon session will be held once the situation is conducive. “The session has to be held. We are waiting for the right time. The virus is sparing no one. If the session is convened and members or on-duty personnel test positive, then it leads to a far-worse situation,” he said.

Babulal Marandi, BJP’s legislative party leader, was not reachable when contacted for his party’s view.

470,['17/07/2020'],BJP has no intention to destabilise govt: Spokesperson Kunal Sarangi,"JAMSHEDPUR: Amid the political crisis in Rajasthan, BJP on Thursday said it is in no way trying to destabilise the JMM-Congress-RJD coalition government in Jharkhand .

The saffron party’s spokesperson, Kunal Sarangi , refuted the recent allegations of JPCC president Rameshwar Oraon, who said BJP is trying to wean away some of his MLAs. In his allegations, Oraon told the media without naming anyone or providing figures that BJP is trying to lure some Congress MLAs with money. Oraon even alleged that BJP, which he said drove a wedge between Congress leaders Ashok Gehlot (Rajasthan chief minister) and Sachin Pilot (former deputy chief minister), is putting all efforts to dislodge the coalition government in Jharkhand.

Talking to TOI, Sarangi said, “Rameshwar-Ji is trying to hog the limelight and ignore the differences within his party and blame BJP by saying we are in contact with some Congress MLAs. He even alleged that money is being offered to the MLAs to break away from the party so that the Hemant Soren government can be reduced to a minority.”

He, however, said BJP has adopted a wait-and-watch plan as “all is not well within the coalition”. Citing the cases of Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh and Pilot in Rajasthan, Sarangi said the young and dynamic leaders are marginalised by the Congress high command and claimed that the situation in Jharkhand is no different. “Young leaders in the state Congress, who want to work, are not being given a chance,” he added.

Oraon, who is also the state finance minister, had said the “evil” intentions of BJP will not come to fruition and termed Congress MLAs as “tikau” (lasting) and not “bikau” (can be purchased) and said the government is running smoothly and working for the common people.

Rejecting Oraon’s assertions, Sarangi claimed that the grand old party has failed to live up to the expectations of the people of the state and now Congress wants to hide it by painting BJP as the villain. He said BJP respects the mandate of the voters and will play the role of a constructive opposition in the state assembly.

The BJP spokesperson went on to say that there is a lot of internal friction within the ruling coalition and many of the Congress MLAs are not very pleased with their leadership. He advised Oraon to take note of such dissent, which he said may snowball into major issues and might trigger wider cracks within Congress.

He said, “Oraon-Ji should look after his own house rather than blaming BJP.” Referring to the recent win of BJP candidate Deepak Prakash in the Rajya Sabha polls, Sarangi said his party is doing good in the state and will do even better in the coming days.

474,['17/07/2020'],"After 4-year wait, Maha HSC results breach 90% mark","Nagpur: After a long wait of four years, Maharashtra state board’s Std XII (HSC) results finally breached the 90% mark with an overall passing percentage of 90.66%. This was an increase of 4.78 percentage points from last year’s passing percentage of 85.88%.

While the exact reason is hard to ascertain — considering that over 14 lakh students appeared for the exam — many believe it is a mix of liberal marking, ample paper evaluation time and increased awareness levels of students.

Ashok Gavhankar, general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association (VJUCTA), said the pandemic played an indirect role in this. “Our HSC exams got over before the lockdown started, but its impact was felt later on. Our evaluators got plenty of time to assess the papers due to lockdown and that is why they could notice the efforts put by students,” said Gavhankar.

“Otherwise, the teachers work under strict deadlines and in such a scenario, the student always loses,” he added. Gavhankar also stated that VJUCTA had written to the board about deadline pressure and the effect it has on evaluation.

Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal, Adarsh Vidya Mandir, said the pending change of course seemed to be a reason. “This batch was the last one which appeared under the old course. So when papers were assessed, it’s natural that the evaluators would keep that in mind. Students, too, pushed themselves hard, knowing well that they did not want to be stuck with the old course,” said Tiwari.

Madhu Phopre, principal of MES Junior College, agreed that students got a boost. “There’s nothing unfair about the marking. It is just that evaluators were not harsh this time. When assessments were going on, coronavirus was in full flow, so evaluators also sympathize with students in such situations. Also, colleges control 20 internal marks, so not much is required for a student to pass in theory,” she said.

Manisha Mahatme, a senior academician and state awardee in the education field, said ‘awareness’ had changed everything. “The bar has been raised as we see increase in awareness and need. Students and parents want to achieve more than others,” said Mahatme.

Ambedkar school vice-principal Kabir Rawlekar concurred, saying students had become aware of the competition faced by them. “There is a trend emerging wherein students are becoming conscious of the competitive scenario and preparing well,” said Rawlekar.

Dilip Bose, executive member of School Headmasters Charitable Association (SHCA), said that students had indeed put in a lot of effort. “Students compare themselves with others and take extra efforts to push through,” said Bose.

Many academicians who did not wish to be identified said the combination of internal and theory marks helped prop up the passing percentage. One such academician said, “Out of 20 internal marks, we give an average of 18 marks to students. Evaluators have not been harsh with marking in theory papers, and that may have helped.”

In the state, the corresponding number rose almost 65%. With CBSE and ISC recording a massive rise in students scoring above 95% nationally, though, self-financed courses could see a rise in cut-offs.Several colleges recorded a success rate of almost 100% in arts on Thursday. At St Xavier’s College, success rate for science was 98.5% and arts 99.7%, with one student failing. In arts, 322 of 357 students got distinction.Jai Hind College principal Ashok Wadia said, “Though HSC marks have improved, state students are still behind other boards for admissions. It is high time one applies one’s mind and brings validation and equivalence among boards. Unrealistic percentage competition should stop somewhere.”K C College principal Hemlata Bagla said the cut-offs may drop after the first or second list due to high mobility of students among colleges.Principals say the pandemic may have an impact on the choice of colleges. Some say students seeking to study abroad or even in national institutes in other states may take a year’s drop or decide to study in the city. Within Mumbai, too, some may choose to seek admissions closer home, to avoid the local train commute.“A lot of things will depend on how students make their choice,” said Parag Thakkar from H R College.“Students may rethink their study-abroad plans.

Union minister of state for HRD Sanjay Dhotre, who is MP from Akola, e-launched these kits from Akola. Dhotre has ensured that these kits would be used in Vidarbha region on priority.“At a time when widespread testing is of utmost importance amid the coronavirus crisis, this very low-cost diagnostic kit is a great feat that IIT Delhi has achieved in very short period,” said Dhotre.Base price of this kit is Rs399 and after adding the RNA isolation and laboratory charges, one test will cost only Rs650. These kits will be available in registered private laboratories across Vidarbha. So, citizens having a prescription of a registered doctor can get themselves tested right in their town/city.Corosure is probe-free, RT-PCR-based Covid-19 diagnostic kit developed by researchers of IIT Delhi’s Kusuma School of Biological Sciences.Current testing methods are “probe-based”, while the one used in this kit is a “probe-free” method, which reduces the testing cost without compromising on accuracy. At present, an RT-PCR test costs Rs2,500 to Rs2,800 while the rapid antigen test costs Rs950 to Rs1,250 in private set-up. Tests are done for free in government set-up.In fact, the IIT Delhi scientists have identified unique short stretches of RNA sequences in the genome of novel coronavirus by using comparative sequence analyses. The test kit detects these unique short stretches and confirms the infection. The research was being carried out since March and it has proved successful on all parameters.In Vidarbha, Covid infection cases are now being reported from rural areas. Dhotre’s Akola is worst-hit district in the region. “We have decided to use these kits in Akola and adjacent districts on priority. More tests will ensure better containment of the virus,” he said adding 10 companies producing Corosure have agreed to provide 5,000 kits for free to the government after production of each batch of 1 lakh units.

He has directed Mahagenco to set up several solar parks having total capacity of 602 MW in three phases. In the second phase, three solar parks having total capacity of 390 MW would come up in Vidarbha.

Raut told the media that in the first phase 187 MW capacity would come up at Kaudgaon (50 MW), Latur (60 MW), thermal power station lands at Bhusawal, Koradi, Parli and Nasik (52 MW) and Sakri (25 MW). “Loan will be taken from German government agency KfW and money sanctioned earlier by state government would also be utilized. Mahagenco has been directed to submit the proposal for cabinet approval immediately,” said the minister.

Mahagenco officials said that solar panels would be installed on vacant land near ash bund in Koradi and the solar project would not affect the 2x660 MW thermal expansion project that is at present in limbo.

In the second phase, three solar parks having total 390 MW capacity would come up in Vidarbha. They are Washim (170 MW), Yavatmal (75 MW) and Kachrala (Chandrapur) (145 MW). They would be funded by KfW loan and equity infusion by state government. The proposal for cabinet approval of these projects would be prepared soon.

In the third stage, 25 MW capacity addition would be done at Sakri solar park using domestic loan of lowest rate of interest and equity infusion by state government.

Under ultra mega renewable energy solar park scheme of central government, some 2,500 MW capacity solar parks will be set up in the state by a joint venture of Mahagenco and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). Solar projects would be developed by individual companies as per their share in the joint venture company.

These projects were discussed between Raut and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in Mantralaya on Thursday. Pawar, who holds the finance portfolio, agreed to clear these projects.

478,['17/07/2020'],SIAM: Bharat Stage VI,"Kolkata: The pandemic-led disruption in sales and revenues of auto companies at the crucial juncture when they had pumped in huge amounts to migrate to Bharat Stage VI emission technology will impact future investments, including roll-out of electric vehicles, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers ( SIAM ) president Rajan Wadhera cautioned on Tuesday.

""The auto sector was passing through one of the worst contractions when the lockdown happened. This year, the auto sector is looking at a decline of 26-45% depending on the vehicle category. Coupled with that of last year, we are looking at a decline of 50% in two years. When the demand is half, I don't see any case for investment in the sector. Investments will dry up. Whatever investments are in the pipeline to get products out will be made. But very little money will be put into new products or plant and capacity addition,"" Wadhera said.

Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had set an EV target of 30% by 2030, up from 1% at present. That would mean sales of at least 1.5 million passenger cars assuming that the auto industry then manufacturers 5 million cars, up from 4 million at present. To achieve this, companies will have to invest several thousand crores in technology, design and development of EVs.

But the SIAM chief did not see this happening. ""You can't keep on borrowing money and investing. Even if you want to, if you do not have revenue you cannot invest,"" Wadhera said, adding that the industry cannot ""afford"" to invest in EV in the present scenario.

The only way India could avoid missing the EV technology and growth curve, he felt, was through government incentives to revive demand and collaboration between industry and academia. ""Governments all over the world, including the US, Italy, France and even Thailand have provided incentives to the auto industry. Since last September, we have been trying to impress upon the government to introduce fiscal measures that can generate demand.

479,['17/07/2020'],‘Allow Eid prayers in masjids with 50-attendee limit’,"Nagpur: Stating that there is no alternative to qurbani (animal sacrifice), Muslim organizations have demanded that the state government must allow the upcoming Eid-ul-Zuha prayers in masjids on the lines of marriage ceremonies wherein gathering of up to 50 persons has been permitted.

All places of worship have been shut since March 24 when the nationwide Covid lockdown was imposed. Though the central and state governments have allowed markets to reopen and marriage ceremonies to take place with certain conditions as part of ‘mission begin again’, no decision has been taken for places of worship.

“Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray must let all places of worship reopen with permission for maximum 50 persons at any given time. We will ensure all distancing norms are religiously followed at masjids. Government must give us at least one chance,” said Jamiat Ulema Hind (JuH) Nagpur president Hafiz Masood Ahmed.

Ahmed said all masjids have followed the guidelines and will continue to do so. “Already, juma (Friday prayers) are being offered at homes. As all other things are opening up, why keep places of worship shut,” he asked.

Regarding qurbani, he said, “Generally, the sacrifice takes place at individual homes so there is no cause of concern. There is no alternative to qurbani.”

Jamiat-e-Islahul Momeneen secretary Hamid Qureshi said Eid should be celebrated in simple way. “Those having financial problems are exempt from qurbani ritual. If people want, 3-4 families can buy one goat and celebrate the Eid,” he said.

Amid Covid times, sale of goats and sheep for sacrifice is another concern as big crowds of not just traders and buyers but also curious onlookers gather at such places.

Over the years, the sacrificial animals have been sold from Mominpura goat market, Jaffar Nagar and Neher on Kamptee Road. Community members wish to address the concern by seeking multiple selling points within the city so as to avoid large gatherings at one place.

Atiquee Qureshi, an agent in goat trade, said the ‘mandi’ must be temporarily shifted back to Mominpura till Eid, which is likely to be celebrated on August 1. “Transporting goats from APMC Kalamna will add to the cost for people beside causing crowding,” he said.

Speculations are also rife that not many would opt for buying sacrificial animals and restrict Eid celebration to just praying and spending time at home.

Hafiz Sohel Ather feels the lockdown has left a dent in the income of many and the middle class may refrain from qurbani ritual. “Just 14 days are remaining, but you don’t see any rush or enthusiasm about qurbani this year. In case we get permission, we will offer Eid prayers in masjids with full precaution. Traditional hugs and handshakes would be avoided,” he said.

Ather added that whether there is lockdown or not, people must avoid crowding during Eid for the safety of all.

MUMBAI: Exactly 10,366 Covid-19 patients in the city are currently undergoing treatment at their homes compared to 9,771 who are in hospitals. Another 2,691 patients are in the jumbo Covid field facilities created to care for mild and moderate patients. The breakup, based on 22,828 active cases as on Thursday afternoon, shows that a growing number (45%) of positive patients are choosing home care over hospitalisation.A Marol couple, who had tested positive for coronavirus three weeks ago, said they sought home care fearing isolation in a hospital. ""We didn't want to be cut off from each other particularly,"" said the husband, a pharma executive.A majority of Covid patients are currently under treatment in their homes.“I had been stepping out regularly for work and knew my chances of getting infected were high. I had even purchased a pulse oximeter and BP monitoring machine in April itself,” said a pharma executive from Marol. Both he and his wife tested positive three weeks ago. He admitted to checking oxygen levels every 15-20 minutes in the first three days. “Our symptoms were not very serious, but we were anxious. We started feeling better by the sixth-seventh day,” he said, adding he was constantly in touch with doctors over video calls.Physicians believe an increasing number of people seeking home care is a sign of the Covid panic being on the wane. Civic officials, however, say home treatment numbers have increased in the last few weeks with more infections coming from the non-slum areas. “When Mumbai saw its peak, we had a majority of cases coming from the slums. But in the last few weeks, the trend has reversed as we are seeing more cases from the high-rises, something we had seen in the beginning of the pandemic,” said Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary on special deputation to BMC. “Since they have the avenue to isolate themselves at home, most prefer this over getting hospitalised,” she added.The initial few days are challenging for both patients and physicians. “They have high fever, cough, bodyache and anxiety. Some of them constantly call. Besides treating these symptoms, doctors must do a lot of counselling,” said Dr Hemant Gupta, professor of medicine at Grant Medical College and a physician. Some patients check their oxygen levels up to 50 times in a day. “If the cough and fever is persistent, I recommend an X-ray after two days,” he said, adding that he has treated nearly 50 patients at home. Paediatrician Dr Bijal Srivastava, who consults with L H Hiranandani Hospital, said even children, unless they have heart or lung disease, or immune deficiencies, are advised home care. “We put them on multivitamins, vitamin C and zinc and tell parents to alert us if symptoms worsen,” she said.Experts, however, caution signs of deteriorating symptoms shouldn’t be missed.“A fever that doesn’t subside after 5-6 days, breathlessness and dipping oxygen saturation levels are red flags. And these could be seen even in young and without comorbidities, so one can’t lower guard for two weeks,” she said. Dr Singhal added that for elderly patients with comorbidities, hospitalisation is advisable as symptoms could deteriorate rapidly. A doctor said there was need for propagation of treatment protocols among GPs.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77009856,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-499403,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/45-of-ve-mumbaikars-now-in-home-quarantine/articleshow/77009818.cms
481,['17/07/2020'],4 leopard cubs land in Gorewada as effort to unite with mother fails,"Nagpur: Perhaps the first long experiment to reunite four 1.5-month-old leopard cubs in Akola district with their mother failed despite Herculean efforts. The abandoned cubs have now been shifted to the Gorewada Rescue Centre at Nagpur.

According to state’s chief wildlife warden Nitin H Kakodkar, this was first such long dedicated effort to reunite four cubs with mother leopardess. “We successfully reunited such cubs in Junnar where mother took away all four cubs,” said Kakodkar.

Akola divisional forest officer (DFO) Vijay Mane said on June 30, three cubs were found in Pastul in the bushy patch on banks of Morna river in Akola. On July 1, the fourth cub, which was a bit weak, was also sighted.

“The spot where these cubs were found has a good forest patch under Patur range. When we learnt about it, locals had started gathering but later strict vigilance was maintained and efforts were started to reunite cubs with mother,” said Mane.

“Rains were a hurdle, but we made serious efforts. We built a machan and installed cameras to keep round-the-clock vigil. Initially, we fed 10-15 ml goat milk regularly three times a day to the cubs. The feed was later increased to 20-25ml.

“After feeding the cubs in evening, we used to put them in a plastic crate and staff used to keep a watch. We recorded presence of mother nearby and also had direct sighting but to our surprise it did not take away the cubs. The langur calls always indicated her presence. We also recorded presence of a male leopad in the area and one more female with cubs at a distance away. We also heard mating calls of the male,” said Mane.

Wildlife biologist and expert Vidya Athreya expressed surprise over mother not taking away the cubs. “It is possible there may be other leopards in the area,” she said.

Dr Ajay Deshmukh, wildlife vet and expert, said, “Though forest department made committed efforts, there can be several reasons for failure. Presence of a male trying to lure the leopardess into mating may be one. Otherwise, females never leave cubs in such a state.”

Between 2009 and 2019, Dr Deshmukh had 70 reunion cases of leopard cubs in Junnar forest division in Pune. These included 10 cases where there were four cubs. The Akola forest officials were in regular touch with Deshmukh.

Dr Deshmukh said, “If it is the first litter of the female, she would avoid from coming near the cubs suspecting foul play. They also tend to avoid flash of cameras.”

FDCM divisional manager Nandkishore Kale said, “The cubs are in a healthy state and are playful. They have been kept in a room. Interested people can approach us for adoption for which annual fee would be Rs 50,000 per cub. We will put names of such parties on display.”

On what next, PCCF (wildlife) Kakodkar said, “As of now nothing has been decided. If we plan to send them to a zoo, Central Zoo Authority (CZA) permission would be needed.”

Recently, the cabinet decided that posts remaining vacant for seven years shall be deemed abolished. The HLEC and inter-departmental committee of officers (IDCO), which had been constituted by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, had ruled that posts that remain vacant for five years would be deemed abolished. Both committees were discontinued by chief minister Pramod Sawant last year.

Thursday’s order, which was issued by the personnel department, also stated that proposals towards outsourcing of activities such as housekeeping, security and services sourced through the Goa Human Resource Development Corporation (GHRDC) shall, for the first time, be referred to the personnel department and thereafter to the finance department for concurrence.

Departments need not approach the two departments for extension of existing agreements of outsourcing. They can do so with the approval of the minister of department concerned, the order read.

The proposal for extension shall be required to be referred to the departments of personnel and finance only if there are changes in the existing contract in terms of number of personnel or of rates.

Complainant Nevil Furtado had sought information from the PIO of the Colva panchayat pertaining to encroachments by gaddas on road setback and public spaces, and also pertaining to licences issued to gaddas and rickshaws. As no information was furnished to him, Furtado appealed before the first appellate authority, who directed the PIO to furnish the necessary information within a stipulated time.

The PIO failed to comply with the directions, prompting Furtado to approach the Goa State Information Commission.

“The PIO must introspect that non-furnishing of correct or (furnishing) incomplete information lands the citizen before the first appellate authority and also before this commission resulting into unnecessary harassment of the common man, which is socially abhorring and legally impermissible,” state information commissioner Pratima Vernekar noted in her order.

The total amount payable as penalty shall be deducted from the salary of the PIO, the order states.

The parcel of land, admeasuring 20,245 sqm, was originally acquired by WRD for the construction of a command area development authority complex for the Selaulim irrigation project.

Deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavalekar, who also holds the agriculture portfolio, had recently requested for a piece of the land to be allotted for the construction of a krishi ghar, which could house a mini demonstration farm and also be used to host zonal agricultural activities.

The proposal was placed before the cabinet meeting on Wednesday to which the cabinet approved the land transfer, valued at Rs 1.49 lakh, at the rate of Rs 20 per sqm.

An official said the WRD had constructed six godowns in the area, some of which were used for storing bandhara gates, and machinery.

NEW DELHI: The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has suggested regulating price of the experimental Covid-19 medicine Remdesivir used in hospitalised patients who are on oxygen support on the basis of a cost analysis of the API used in the formulation.The proposal states that the price of the drug can come down substantially and CSIR has submitted its recommendations depicting scope for sizeable reduction in cost of treatment with regard to the drug used for treating severely ill patients, sources said.“The proposal to cap the price of the drug is under active consideration by the drug price regulator, National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA),” an official toldThe NPPA is the drug price regulator of India. Remdesivir is currently priced in the range of Rs 4,000-Rs 5,000 per vial and the total cost for the drug during treatment is estimated between Rs 40,000 and Rs 55,000. The drug – originally developed by an American firm Gilead – has been launched in India by a number of generic drug makers including Cipla, Hetero and Mylan who entered a licensing agreement with the drug’s patent holder.At least three more companies – Jubilant Life Sciences, Dr Reddy’s Labs and Cadila are also expected to launch their brands of Remedisivir very soon.While this arrangement itself has brought down the price of the drug, CSIR thinks it can still be brought down substantially.""The idea behind the proposal is to make the drug available and affordable to all in such a crisis,"" another official said.Sources said a slew of meetings have taken place in last two weeks between the Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP), NPPA, health ministry and NITI Aayog.While Remedisivir is just one of the expensive drugs being tried for COVID-19 patients, it assumes significance because it is part of the standard treatment protocol for COVID-19 suggested by the health ministry.

“It is important that DSDE prepares a roadmap which should not only take in account the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) operating in the state, but also the private institutes registered under the Human Resource Development Foundation Society and the proposed industry apprenticeship initiative,” said Martins.

Goacan has also recommended that DSDE initiate a statewide consultation to identify essential skills for the economic revival of Goa.

“The DSDE should examine the Gram Panchayat Development Plan of the 190 panchayats and identify the skill training requirements in collaboration with GIPARD. The DSDE must also develop the appropriate linkages with GSUDA to see possible tie-ups in view of the National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM),” said Goacan.

“The wall collapsed after heavy rain lashed the area last week. We are trying to erect the wall as soon as possible,” chief wildlife warden, Santosh Kumar said.

Of the fifty metre wall, an expanse of about eleven meters has collapsed. The animals are safe, officials from the Bondla range forest office told TOI.

The zookeepers have sealed the perimeter temporarily. However, this has been rudimentarily done with the help of a mesh net, sticks and bricks.

The forest officials are rushing to get it fixed because the enclosure shares its partition wall with the enclosures of the black buck and sambhar. Fear of the animals coming into potential conflict with each other is giving the zookeepers sleepless nights.

“There is no threat to the animals at present, but we have to fix the wall immediately. The work has already been handed to the PWD. However, we are also working on getting it fixed departmentally in case the work gets delayed,” an official said, adding that the repair will cost an estimated Rs 6 lakh.

During an inspection earlier this month of the Neura khazan over salt water intrusion, the department learnt from farmers that they could not cultivate their fields earlier since these were flooded with saline water.

“The agency executing the reconstruction of the dilapidated ‘Pilo’ sluice gate had constructed a cofferdam around it due to which saline water from the khazan bund in the vicinity of the sluice gate could not be drained out,” explained the department in its inspection report, adding that as a result the water could not be regulated from the sluice gate.

“However, the entire work of the sluice gate was completed on May 31 and after removal of the cofferdam, the sluice gate has been put to operation and at present there is no waterlogging in the fields,” stated the inspection report filed by the assistant director of agriculture (Crops), assistant engineer and zonal agricultural officer (Tiswadi).

The commission took cognisance of farmers complaining of saline water entering the fields, preventing them from taking up cultivation.

The commission has called for reports from the director of agriculture, chief engineer water resources department, Tiswadi mamlatdar and Neura Khazan Tenants Association chairman over breaches in the bundh and saline water entering the fields.

The farmers stated that a bundh was constructed with poor quality material, while another part of it is still under construction and blamed those involved in sluice gate fishing for releasing saline water into the fields.

Goa never had such a pathological liar as chief minister,” GFP president Vijai Sardesai, said.GFP said that Sawant, by shamelessly and blatantly lying about what the governor had said, had crossed all limits, exposing once again characteristic traits of deceit and duplicity.Congress said Malik’s outright denial of the statements attributed by Sawant to the governor reaffirmed BJP’s traits of false promises and ‘jumla’ (meaningless words).“I am not surprised to hear the lies narrated by Sawant as he is taking ahead the legacy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is a master in fakery, ‘jumlebaz’ Amit Shah and U-turn specialist Manohar Parrikar,” said state Congress president Girish Chodankar.Congress also strongly condemned the act of the chief minister who “tried to blame mainstream media and social media users for exposing the misdeeds of the BJP government”.GFP vice president Durgadas Kamat said Sawant had lied about providing immunity boosting homeopathic pills through all the 40 MLAs. “It is not a surprise that Sawant is now playing dirty politics with regard to the distribution of immunity boosters handed over by Union minister for Ayush Shripad Naik,” said Kamat.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-calls-cm-pathological-liar-slams-him-for-guv-statements/articleshow/77009009.cms

UDAIPUR: Amid the ongoing political crises, the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) has decided to support chief minister Ashok Gehlot.

The party vice-president Paresh Bhai Vasava, in a press conference at Dungarpur on Thursday, said the BTP respects the public mandate and does not want to topple the government which has been elected by the people.

Earlier, the party which has two MLAs in the Rajasthan assembly, had asked its legislators to remain neutral and not align either with CM Gehlot or his deputy Sachin Pilot. Speaking to media, Vasava said BTP would never support anyone who tries to fracture a government unethically, before completion of its term. “We would prefer the Gehlot government to complete its term. Both our MLAs are constantly in touch with the party high command and would act as per directions from the organisation,” Vasava said.

He also said there is no possibility of a floor test immediately, however, if such a situation arises, then the party would act according to the need of the hour.

Party president Velaram Goghra said BTP has always abided by the principles of issue-based politics. “It has been our motive to communicate the public demand and requirement before the government and get them fulfilled for the general good. We had put forth five demands before the government which includes implementation of Maharashtra pattern in Rajasthan, planning in tribal area according to the availability of natural resources and to give charge of the tribal advisory committee to the minister of tribal area development,” he said.

496,['17/07/2020'],"With one day to stock up, citizens rush to markets for essential items","People stand in queue outside shop to stock-up groceries ahead of lockdown in Goa.

PANAJI/CALANGUTE: As citizens readied themselves for the three-day lockdown from Friday to Sunday, serpentine queues of buyers were hard to miss. People seemed to have resorted to panic buying for the second day in a row in a bid to stock up on vegetables, especially since horticulture outlets are going to be shut.

“None of the (horticulture) outlets will be allowed to open. We have informed our suppliers from other states to suspend operations until Monday. Due to panic buying, most of the outlets managed to sell majority of their vegetables,” chairman of the Goa State Horticulture Corporation Ltd, Pravin Zantye, said.

He said that vegetable supply will normalise Monday onwards. Buyers purchased grocery items , oil and biscuits in bulk, said Netty Fernandes, manager at the one of the Panaji-based outlets of the Goa Sahakar Bhandar.

“The government has not come out with any notification about the closure of grocery stores. We are not sure if we are to operate or not. We have therefore allowed customers to purchase bulk quantities of the perishable goods,” Fernandes said.

While small kirana stores saw a rush to purchase essentials till the shelves were near-empty, the situation was no different at the otherwise well-stocked superstores as well. “I wanted to stock up on brown eggs and broccoli, but the entire shelf of exotic produce was wiped clean,” a St Inez resident, who had gone to a Magson’s outlet, said.

In the Calangute-Candolim beach belt, fish vendors made a killing with five-six medium mackerels going for Rs 500-600. Other varieties of seafood were also sold at exorbitant rates. There were long queues at chicken and meat shops, with vendors not hiking their rates. Many items like tomatoes were sold out in some places due to bulk buying. Some shops and restaurants stayed shut on Thursday.
