Reports suggest that the Central Crime Branch officials and their lawyers argue that Ragini, who is remanded to judicial custody in relation to the ongoing drug probe, may influence witnesses and tamper with the investigation, if she is allowed to go out on bail. However, according to Ragini’s father, Col Rakesh Kumar Dwivedi , these presumptions are baseless. “If Ragini had been as influential as everyone claims her to be, she would be hiding. She would have never been caught and the influential people she is connected with would have tipped her off. She is instead patiently serving her time. All I urge the officials is not to treat her as a criminal already. Those in custody are innocent until they are proven guilty. We have full faith in the judicial system, but the delay is frustrating,” he says, adding, “There are so many bail hearings that are being heard in limited time, so it is getting delayed there. We know that there is nothing much that has been found against her. The CCB officials state that she isn't cooperating with them, I don't know why they keep repeating the same thing.

4,['27/09/2020'],SAD walks out of NDA,"The SAD, a long-time constituent of the NDA, and the BJP had been allies since 1996. (ANI)

CHANDIGARH: Bharatiya Janata Party ’s (BJP) oldest ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) walked out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition in protest against the three farm bills and for continues ‘insensitivity’ towards Punjabi language and issues pertaining to Sikh community.

Terming the bills anti-farmers and anti-Punjab, the core committee of the party decided unanimously to pull out of the BJP -led NDA alliance. The party held the centre's “stubborn” refusal to give statutory legislative guarantees to protect assured marketing of farmers crops on MSP and its continued insensitivity to Punjabi and Sikh issues like excluding Punjabi language as official language in Jammu and Kashmir the reasons for the decision.

Harsimrat Kaur Badal, the lone representative of the party in the Union Cabinet, had resigned on September 17.

The meeting was presided over by the SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal who said that SAD will continue to stand by its core principles of peace, communal harmony and guard the interest of Punjab, Punjabi in general and Sikhs and farmers in particular. He said that the decision has been taken in consultation with the people of Punjab especially party workers and farmers. Badal said that the bills on agricultural marketing brought by the BJP government are lethal and disastrous for the already beleaguered farmers.

He said the SAD was the oldest ally of the BJP, but the government did not listen to repeated pleas of honouring the sentiments of farmers. The SAD leader said that the party opposed these bills in the parliament and voted against them.

He said that even after quitting the union government, the SAD had hoped that the centre would not press on with these "" murderous assaults” on farmers and other poor sections who depend on agriculture and trade. “It seems that the BJP is totally out of touch with ground realities,” said Badal,

He said that despite our best efforts, the BJP government did not honour the sentiments of farmers. He said that the farmers are the backbone of the national economy and it is in the national interest that the government should stand by them. Adding, he said that with successive decisions, the present government has shown its callous insensitivity to minority sentiments and has been indifferent to the peace and communal harmony in the country, especially in Punjab.

Senior Akali leader Dr Daljit Cheema said that the decision has been taken after much deliberation. He further said that these bills were passed in an undemocratic manner and are being opposed in Punjab, Haryana and other states. ""We had even requested President of India Ram Nath Kovind not to approve the bills passed by the parliament,"" said Dr Daljit Cheema.

While slamming BJP for not paying heed to repeated pleas of SAD not to force anti-farmers bills, Prof Prem Singh Chandumajra said that there is no point in continuing in alliance.

SAD had first forged an alliance with Bharatiya Jana Sangh, BJP’s predecessor, during state assembly elections in 1969. It later entered into coalition with BJP in 1997 during the state election. SAD joined BJP-led alliance at the centre in 1998.

CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal announced on Saturday night its decision to break its 24-year-old alliance with BJP less than 10 days after it pulled out of PM Narendra Modi’s government with the resignation of Harsimrat Kaur Badal over the passage of three agri-marketing bills in Parliament.The alliance between SAD and BJP, formed just after the parliamentary elections of 1996, had increasingly seemed untenable as the party was facing immense pressure from its main vote base, the farmers, to completely cut ties with BJP. The party was on the backfoot in Punjab, where spontaneous protests against the agri-marketing bills led by farmers had the party worried about its future, especially as both the ruling Congress party and the opposition Aam Aadmi Party were highlighting the Badal family’s so-called reluctance to quit the alliance with BJP.SAD’s decision to pull out of the National Democratic Alliance was decided unanimously at an emergency meeting of its core committee, the party’s highest decision-making body. After the three-hour meeting, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said his party was BJP’s oldest ally but the Modi government did not listen to it on honouring the sentiments of farmers. He described the three agri-marketing bills as “lethal and disastrous for the already beleaguered farmers”. The party said it had quit the alliance in protest against the three agri-marketing bills and the Centre’s “stubborn” refusal to give statutory legislative guarantees to protect assured marketing of farmers’ crops at the MSP and for the Centre’s continued “insensitivity” towards the Punjabi language and issues of the Sikh community.Promising to stand by its core principles of peace, communal harmony and guarding the interest of Punjab, Punjabi in general, and Sikhs and farmers in particular, Sukhbir said the decision was taken in consultation with the people of Punjab, especially party workers and farmers. In a direct attack on the BJP government at the Centre, Sukhbir said with successive decisions the central government had shown its “callous insensitivity” to minority sentiments and has been indifferent to peace and communal harmony in the country, especially in Punjab.Even after quitting the Modi government, Sukhbir said the SAD had hoped that the Centre would not press on with these “murderous assaults” on farmers and other poor sections who depend on agriculture and trade. “It seems that BJP is totally out of touch with ground realities,” he said.

Claiming that his party was neither informed nor asked before passing the bills, he said SAD would not allow the end of the MSP regime.“If Pain & Protests of 3 cr punjabis fail to melt the rigid stance of GoI, it’s no longer the #NDA envisioned by Vajpayee ji & Badal sahab.

10,['27/09/2020'],SSR portrait to light up Durga Puja pandals in Bengal,"Durga Puja is less than a month away and fans and admirers of actor Sushant Singh Rajput continue to remember the actor in ever new ways. This year, various artists and Durga Puja organisers of Bengal have decided to pay tribute to the late actor through pandal decorations and the light artists of Chandannagar too are not far behind.

But why SSR, we ask. “We got an order from a popular Puja organiser in Chandannagar. They wanted to pay tribute to the late actor through our lightings. We have done the drawing first and then the stencil is made. With the help of the stencil, we perforate a metal or a fibre plate and put in LED lights before colouring the plate and polishing it with varnish,” said Babu Pal, a senior light artist from Chandannagar. When contacted, Nirmal Kumar Das of the Chandannagar Puja committee said, “We all are pained by the untimely death of the young actor. We are not interested in the controversy that is taking place with regard to his death right now. We just want to remember him fondly and hope his soul rests in peace.”

Another club known as Masterda Smriti Snagha, near Kolkata, has decided to decorate their pandal with Sushant's portraits drawn on traditional Kalighat patachitra saucers. While the committee refused to divulge details of the actual theme of their puja, we have learnt that the Kartik idol may be crafted to resemble the Dil Bechara and Byomkesh actor. Shimul Majumder, secretary of the club, told us that Sushant Singh Rajput was an actor who had impressed Bengalis with his portrayal for the popular fictional character Byomkesh. ""More than that, his death is a loss for the entire nation. On the other hand, good-looking Bengali men are compared to Kartik, the handsome god who leads Ma Durga's army. Sushant's features and looks match the description of Kartik and that’s why we decided to portray him as Kartik in our Puja,” he added.

Sonarika Bhadoria of Devon Ke Dev Mahadev fame has lost oodles of weight and is ready to be back on screen. The actress, who was recently body shamed for her new skinny look, talks about the post she put on her social media handle and much more in an exclusive chat with us...Yes, I have lost a lot of weight. After every project, I tend to go off dieting and healthy eating but this time, after my show Prithvi Vallabh - Itihaas Bhi, Rahasya Bhi ended, I immediately jumped on to Dastaan-E-Mohabbat Salim Anarkali and then after that Ishq Mein Marjawan happened and I didn't get time to have my favourite junk food. So after my last show ended I ate a lot to my heart's desire and had put on a lot of weight. By December I had put on 10-12 kgs. So once I was done with the eating part, I utilized the lockdown to lose weight. But yes, I was also worried about our industry as the entertainment industry is badly hit by this pandemic. Not everyone had the luxury to sit at home and eat.Sonarika Bhadoria (BCCL/ bsonarika)It is not that I have suddenly become bold with my photoshoots. If you rewind back to a couple of years, I had posted pictures in a bikini on my account. And it is not about being bold -- I feel that if you have got something, and you have worked really hard for it, you've got to flaunt it too. I am quite comfortable with my body.Coming to the body shaming part, this is a very recent trend for people to come and vent out their frustration on public profiles. As a celebrity, people can write and criticize our performance on a show, as then we are selling them a product which they didn't like. But they have no right to go personal. And then why should I turn off my comments if someone is body shaming me? I have my fans too writing good stuff about me.I don't think so aisa hota hai. I wouldn't be getting offers then. If you are a good actor, work wise nothing will go wrong with you. Having said that, I did think once about the ratings of my shows but then if you see the shows, they have been really good and my character has been larger than life in them, which my kids too can watch.I don't see myself getting married for another couple of years. But when I am going to get married, I am going to get married! I will not be working post marriage as I believe in living every phase of my life to the fullest. I am very much single now though I have had a couple of relationships in the past. I am at a stage in my life where I am done with frivolous relationships and casual dating. Now whoever comes in my life will be forever.I think I have been ready for a long time. I am getting a few offers which I am considering. Thankfully I haven't been stereotyped in any kind of image as I have done a variety of roles, from a mythological to a thriller, though after Devon Ke Dev Mahadev I had this in mind that kahin typecast toh nahi ho jaungi. But it's been several years now that I have not been offered a mythological show.Yes, just like after every show's wrapup, I come to relax in Lucknow, this time too I did the same thing.

The incident took place at Mira Road on Thursday afternoon. Hours after the harrowing experience, Sanjay shared a video on his Instagram handle, warning fellow Mumbaikars against such goons. According to the actor, he was travelling from Mira Road to his show’s set in Naigaon at around 2.30 pm.Narrating the incident, he said, “I was on the road towards Naigaon, when a man on a scooter approached my car and started banging on the window, hurling abuses at the same time. He made me pull over and asked me to roll down the window. As soon as I did that, he put his hand inside the car, opened the door and got inside. He snatched my mobile, and told me that my car had banged into his two-wheeler, causing damages worth `20,000. He claimed that his hand was also injured in the accident. Soon, two-three other men joined him. They wanted me to withdraw `20,000 from the ATM and give them. When I told them that I didn’t have that much money in my account, they threatened to call the police and started abusing me. By then, I was scared. Finally, they took the entire money in my wallet (`700), returned my phone, and left. I was too shaken to drive for some time and remained inside my car. When they saw that I had not left, they came back, and asked me to drive off immediately. I think they were scared that I would call the police.”The actor was planning to file a police complaint on Friday, but couldn’t.

The #MeToo movement had given rise to so many controversies, but I feel some have now realised the importance of respecting women.Nobody should feel scared before entering the film industry, be it as an actor or a singer, unnecessarily. This industry isn’t known for a few bad people but is known for legends like Lata Mangeshkar Mohammed Rafi and so on. The new talents are always welcome but they should know their capabilities well and work diligently to survive in this industry for a longer period. Youngsters must weigh their talent. A real talent will always shine brighter.This is a new drama happening in this industry, suddenly! That’s all I want to say.Digital performances have picked up only during the pandemic outbreak. But I think, once the situation gets better, things will be back to normal and there will be live shows again — and that too with a bang. The digital shows will continue just for a few months and live shows will resume like before.I miss seeing the audience in front of me. I miss the madness that a performer gets to enjoy while performing in live shows and I miss the love the audience showers on you in reality. The virus is not going to stay forever and we will get back to our normal lives soon.In these difficult times, I have done things to help people and will continue to do so.I have always been a consistent person. I have passion and patience but I cannot be aggressive to earn money. I am still worried about the daily wage earners — how they are surviving and living their lives. I could not help everyone. But yes, I tried to help as many people as possible. This pandemic taught us the meaning of life and how important nature is to us.New people joining this industry have a fire and zeal in them, but everybody cannot be a successful singer. The world is known for special people and special people are rare. Do not lose hope and keep trying.The government is not helping because we are not government employees ( laughs)! We are artistes. We come from the land of dreams, imagination and creativity. We have our own associations and they do take care of artistes.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78334391,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-87596/78334391.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/bengali/music/nepotism-is-a-new-drama-happening-in-this-industry-suddenly-sukhwinder-singh/articleshow/78334391.cms

NEW DELHI: An assurance that India will use its vaccine production and delivery capacities for the benefit of the entire world, a strong pitch for UN reforms and a subtle message to China — that India's friendship with any country is not targeted at a third country — formed the highlights of PM Narendra Modi 's virtual address to the 75th session of the UN General Assembly While his Pakistani counterpart, Imran Khan , had stridently targeted India on the Kashmir issue in his address on Friday, Modi ignored Pakistan altogether while mentioning the need to counter terrorism and drugs in his speech which emphasised that India will not hesitate to raise its voice against ""enemies of humanity"".Modi spoke passionately on the need for UN reforms in his pre-recorded message as he sought to know how long was India going to be kept out of the decision-making structures of the world body despite its large population and successful democracy He said reform in the responses, processes and in the character of the UN is the need of the hour and that every Indian, while seeing the contribution of India in the UN, aspired for India’s expanded role in the United Nations, which enjoyed a high credibility in the country.""When we were strong, we did not trouble the world; when we were weak, we did not become a burden on the world. How long would a country have to wait particularly when the changes happening in that country affect a large part of the world?"" he asked, adding that India was also the country that had lost the maximum number of soldiers in the course of UN peacekeeping missions. ""Today, the people of India are concerned whether this reform-process will ever reach its logical conclusion,"" he said.Modi said the Indian pharma industry had sent essential medicines to more than 150 countries. ""As the largest vaccine-producing country of the world, I want to give one more assurance to the global community today, India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis,"" he said, adding that the Indian government is moving ahead with Phase 3 clinical trials within the country and in the neighbourhood.India will also help all the countries in enhancing their cold chain and storage capacities for the delivery of vaccines, he said. Significantly, even as the border situation with China remains tense, Modi said any ""gesture of friendship"" by India towards one country is not against someone else and that its approach towards the Indo-Pacific is guided by a desire for security and growth for all. Both China and Russia continue to nurse reservations about the Indo-Pacific concept and see it as a US-led initiative to contain Beijing. India maintains though that the Indo-Pacific is a free, open, transparent and inclusive concept with Asean at its centre and that it excludes nobody.Modi also sought to know where the UN was in the joint fight against the novel coronavirus . ""The whole world is fighting the global pandemic of corona for the last 8-9 months. Where is its (UN's) effective response?"" he asked.Modi also said, in an obvious dig at China's Belt Road Initiative, that when India strengthens its development partnership, it is not with any mala fide intent of making the partner country dependent or hapless. ""We have never hesitated from sharing experiences of our development,"" he said.As India prepares to take over as a non-permanent member of the UNSC, Modi said the country will not hesitate in raising its voice against the enemies of humanity, human race and human values — terrorism, smuggling of illegal weapons, drugs and money laundering Modi also said India is moving forward with the vision of ""self-reliant India"" in the changed circumstances of the post-pandemic era. ""A self-reliant India will also be a force multiplier for the global economy. Today, it is also being ensured that there is no discrimination in extending the benefits of all the schemes to every citizen of the country,"" he said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78341589,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-196304,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-presents-upbeat-forward-looking-indian-agenda-at-un/articleshow/78341583.cms

An unattended exhibition opening in 1974 and two paintings that brokerecently shed new light on VS Gaitonde’s journey.hose who knew the late master modernist VS Gaitonde well, thought of him as supremely confident — to the point of being arrogant — about his work. “He just was…,” says auctioneer and gallerist Dadiba Pundole. “In fact, he’d often say, in third person, ‘When Gai shows, Bombay comes to see’.” Recalling an incident with his father, gallerist Kali Pundole, who became the artist’s sole representative for more than two decades, Dadiba shares, “He [Gaitonde] had a show at theduring the Emergency period in November 1974. Nobody showed up on the evening of the opening and he was livid.” Gaitonde’s pal, artist, collector and filmmaker, the only visitor, made an SOS call to Dadiba’s father Kali, who ended up buying all the works. “It wasn’t a moment of magnanimity. He just responded to the show and decided to buy all of it,” says Dadiba. “Later that evening, Bal, Gai and my dad went out for a drink. Gai dropped a bomb — he said to my father, ‘Now, that you’ve bought the show, from tomorrow, you manage it’.” Kali, who was already committed to being at his eponymous gallery in Fort, put artist Adi Davierwala’s daughter Zarine to the task. “Gaitonde told me he was terribly bored, and he was only too happy for me to sit there. It was an absolute joy for me. He even gave me Rs 500 and a drawing at the end of the exhibition,” she remembers.Nearly five decades later, Gaitonde’s 1974 show is back in the reckoning. Two works from 1974 broke records this month. On September 3, an untitled oil on canvas (60 x 40 inches) by him fetched a record-breaking Rs 32 crore on the hammer at Pundole’s auction, “Looking West: Works from the Collection of the Glenbarra Art Museum, Japan”. Gaitonde’s work not only set a world record for the late artist, but also for Indian art as a whole. Then, on September 17, another work from 1974 — an untitled oil on canvas (70 x 40 inches) — sold for Rs 30 crore on the hammer, thus making it the secondhighest bid for any Indian painting. The painting belonged to the estate of theatre personality and etiquette expert Sabira Merchant, who had bought it from Kali in 1975. She recalls: “Back then, Kali rang me up and said there were a few paintings by Gaitonde he thought that I might like. And I absolutely fell in love with two — a green painting from 1974, and another yellow geometric work from the same year.”Incidentally, the yellow geometric work was the same painting that made it to the Sotheby’s India auction last year, which went unsold on the hammer. “For me, the decision to buy the works was spontaneous,” says the 78-year-old actor. “I just loved it so much: the construction and the colours of the paintings. I remember telling Kali Pundole at the time that it was hard for us to afford it. But Kali let me pay for them in instalments.”Much later, Gaitonde revealed to her that the green painting was part of the exhibition at the Taj Art Gallery in 1974. Going by Pundole’s records, Gaitonde had exhibited works from 1974 only at the Taj Art Gallery. Perusing through the archives, Dadiba shares: “As per our records in the Taj show, there was one painting from 1972, two works from 1973, and four to five works from 1974. The 1977 show at Pundole Art Gallery included artworks created between 1975 and 1977.” So, while the record-breaking work from the Glenbarra Art Museum could well be from the Taj show, Dadiba cautions, “I cannot confirm it conclusively.”nlike many artists of his generation, Gaitonde wasn’t trying to answer the larger questions of life through figurative works. Although he was briefly involved with the Progressive Art Group and the Bombay Group, and deeply inspired by Swiss-German painter Paul Klee, by the late 50s, he had veered away from figuration and towards non-objective art. To many, in the ’60s and ’70s, Gaitonde’s canvases began to resemble his American contemporary Mark Rothko. But he didn’t appreciate the comparison. Writer Meera Menezes, who has authored the biography, Vasudeo Santu Gaitonde: Sonata Of Solitude, published by Bodhana Arts Foundation, says: “If in the sixties, his work was evocative of the sea and horizon, with their swathes of colour interrupted by hieroglyphic forms along a horizontal axis; in the seventies, you see the emergence of clearlydefined forms in his works. The paintings are also evocative of ancient frescos, weathered by time. Public recognition found him in 1971, when he was awarded the.”Due to injuries sustained in a serious accident in 1984, Gaitonde stuck briefly to making ink on paper drawings in the mid-80s. It was only in 1989 that he returned to working on larger oils-oncanvas. Auctioneer Dinesh Vazirani estimates that unlike his contemporaries, FN Souza and SH Raza, who have a large body of work behind them, Gaitonde must have created “roughly 400 paintings in his life.” His non-prolific career, which stretched over four decades, was marked by periods of productivity and spells of comfortably doing nothing. “It could be because of simple demand-over-supplythat his works command the price they do,” says Vazirani.Fellow modernist and a friend of the late artist,, has followed the two recent auctions closely. He reflects: “While Gai was confident of his work, he would have — as I have — been surprised by the prices his works are commanding today. But knowing him, he would hardly have bothered…” To Gaitonde, the sadhana of painting mattered more. “Gaitonde had no attachment to his work once it was completed. He was more bothered by the process than the painting,” says Dadiba.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-280028,msid-78341708/78341708.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/when-gai-shows-bombay-comes-to-see/articleshow/78342773.cms

says hospitals can requisition it for ventilators if there is any shortageWith a surge in covid-19 cases, the need for critical care has also increased, Commissioner ofsaid. He said necessary approvals have been obtained to provide ventilators wherever necessary to private medical establishments in the State. The health department has told all districts that if they are running short of ventilators they must send a requisition to the department. The department will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with hospitals and give the responsibility toDrugs Logistics Warehouse Society (KDLWS) to facilitate this process.The MoU will state that private hospitals should use these ventilators for government-referred. The contract agreement states, “Ventilators will be provided temporarily on a loan basis for a period of six months initially without any rental charges. The private medical establishments should use these ventilators only for treatment of government referred patients and Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust (SAST) should deduct an appropriate amount from payments for the treatment of covid patients. The amount deducted will be notified through a separate order by the government from time to time.”A senior official from the department said the ventilators will be charged at Rs. 500 per day, which will be deducted from the SAST team who handle the claims from the hospitals.The department said that the ventilators should be returned to the department of health and family welfare in good and working condition after the pandemic subsides. Any other necessary arrangements to keep the ventilator in good shape is the onus of the private hospitals. “They have asked us to insure the ventilators and handle it. The process of request, MoU and all the paperwork is so laborious. Why cannot the government make these processes simpler? By the time we get the ventilators, a few patients will die,” said a doctor from a private hospital in Bengaluru.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-552844,msid-78340238/78340238.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pvt-hosps-can-get-ventilators-but-conditions-apply/articleshow/78342776.cms

Bringing a closure to the high drama that ensued after a 33-yearold woman had gone missing from the jumbocare centre set up on(CoEP) grounds, she was discovered roaming in the ghat section of Pirangut and was reunited with her emotional family on Saturday evening, 21 days after she exited the facility.This was made possible by a social media post taken viral bylooking for the woman, Priya Gaikwad.Only two days ago, the woman’s mother went on ato push for some action, and finally called it off that very evening after the authorities assured her that all efforts would be taken to track her daughter down. Two subinspectors, Anil Navnath Binawade and, attached to the Shivajinagar police station, who were investigating the case, had deployed the social media network to track the woman down.“The old agency had given us a few documents. Despite the fear of COVID-19, we had to go to the jumbo facility to investigate the case.But knowing the power of social media, we thought it wise to use it and shared the details we had with social workers, political workers and other groups in the hope of finding some help. The woman was handed over to the family at 5.15 pm,” said Binawade.It was Audumbar Dhage, a resident of Mundhwa, who had seen the social media post about the missing woman, spotted her on Paud Road, in the ghat section of Pirangut, at 11.30 am. Recognising her from the picture and description in the post, he approached her. “I asked for her name. She responded and accepted that she was the same woman. She said she had been away from home for long and wanted to get back to her son. I called the number of the family furnished on the post. I was told to keep an eye on her until they arrived. They came in a couple of hours to the agreed location and identified her. Subsequently, we informed the cops and took her to Shivajinagar police station for a formal handover,” Dhage recounted.Priya Gaikwad, admitted to the jumbo facility on August 30, had been discharged on September 5, while her family allegedly was given the impression that she would be allowed to go home only on September 13. The family realised she had gone missing only when they came to collect her on that day. Remarkably, the authorities and the agency (which has since exited the facility) were clueless on her whereabouts. The woman, on Saturday, seemed to be mentally disturbed and could not throw any light on where she was and how she had spent the intervening period.While a missing complaint was filed at the Shivajinagar police station, the family was not impressed with the progress made in finding her, leading to Gaikwad’s mother, Ragini Gambire, resorting to hunger strike. On Saturday when her daughter was finally found, Gambire was reduced to tears, especially noting the condition in which her child was found. “Every day, my grandson would ask for his mother and we had no answer to his questions.(PMC) was clueless on her discharge and did little to help us find her. We’re happy to have found her and are taking her home. But, it has to be said that management of the facility is not good and they provided no support in our hardship,” she told Mirror.Sub-inspector Rathod said in the past one week a team of over 12 cops from the police station were looking for the missing woman. “The huge facility has over 256 CCTV cameras located inside it. We checked clips from all the cameras pertaining to the time she was supposed to have been admitted at the facility. But finally, it was social media that worked like miracle,” he added.Shakeel Shaikh, a social activist, who has been running around with the family, since the day Gaikwad was found to be missing, observed that this case should serve as a lesson, so PMC makes better arrangements at the facility to avoid such instances. “The local body is not taking any responsibility. If something unfortunate happens, who should be held responsible?” he asked.Upset with the trauma Gaikwad evidently has gone through, the family also questioned the isolated fringe area she was finally found in. “The negligence of the management at the CoEP facility put my sister to this hardship. We don’t know how she survived, what she ate and how she negotiated the heavy rains the city experienced the past two weeks. The management is at fault for not informing us the right date of her discharge,” insisted Rupali Kamble, Gaikwad’s cousin.Clearly relieved that the woman has been found,, deputy commissioner at PMC, defended, “The woman was discharged earlier and the family came late to take her home. If the patient was an infant, the family members would have been informed at the time of release. But for an adult, nobody would dream such a thing could happen. We have no clue which doctor told the family she will be discharged on September 13 and the agency that was in charge at the time is gone now.”Bharatiya Janata Party legislator Siddharth Shirole, who took up the case with PMC chief, welcoming the news hoped the civic body would take some lessons from the episode. “The traumatic experience the patient and her family were put through could have been avoided had the management of the facility stayed a little more vigilant. Such things should not be repeated. It’s just fortunate that she was found,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-956412,msid-78339793/78339793.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lost-from-coep-jumbo-centre-found-in-pirangut/articleshow/78342784.cms

Gyms are back in business amid the rising cases of Covid-19. However, with people still wary of contracting theaffecting the numbers, some gym owners have found ways to assure their clientele by involving them in more outdoor activities than in the closed confines of the gym floor.The government had issued guidelines for the opening of gyms with the need for maintaining social distancing and other precautions, but fitness enthusiasts are still to join gyms in large numbers.Two gyms in the city have found a way to attract more people. A gym near Law Garden has been conducting outdoor activities in an open ground, while another gym in Science City area has made arrangements on the terrace of the complex where the gym is housed.""It is very safe to exercise outdoors and the benefits are doubled. First, there will be no air conditioning outdoors, so one burns more calories and also it is safes at a time of pandemic,"" said Parvez Merchant(20), a student who has joined the gym in Law Garden.""I joined the gymnasium on the first day it opened after the lockdown and the fear factor was gone with the start of outdoor activities. The main benefit is that you getapart from social distancing. So, when you exercise, it gives you a feeling of safety and a pleasant environment,"" said 63-year-old Sukeshi Shah.""We opened our gym soon after the government gave the go ahead. But people were afraid of the safety protocols. There was fear of using fitness equipment after others had used it, even though they were sanitised. In addition, we have more than 20,000+ sq ft area of open space for. This gives ample space to maintain social distance and strength training helps gain personal confidence,"" said, director of Fitt Wave gym.Namavati said, ""Every client is given a customised outdoor workout plan to meet their fitness goals. We also conduct special outdoor workout camps in batches for clients to up their endurance levels. Working out in groups increases enthusiasm and we also try and maintain more than 10 feet of distance between the clients. It's a natural anti-depressant and anti-anxiety mechanism. It challenges the body to push more.""The AR fitness gym at Science City has built a separate set up on the terrace for outdoor activities. ""This pandemic has changed a lot in everyone's life and post lockdown the things are not the same as before. Although gyms have opened, still people are afraid to join,"" said Aviey Verma of AR Fitness.According to Verma, ""In this situation, I feel outdoor is the best option and many gyms have also opted for the same. Research says that being around nature releases your anxiety and depression, which also increases serotonin, a hormone that affects your mood and exercise itself produces endorphins, another feel-good hormone that boosts your mood and reduces pain.

NEW DELHI: Congress has conveyed to Rashtriya Janata Dal that it should wind up seat-sharing negotiations within next few days and respect Congress’s choice of constituencies, with senior members saying that failure to pay heed may even result in a break-up ahead of Bihar elections.

While the Congress-RJD alliance has all along appeared firm and Congress even ready to project Tejashwi Yadav as the chief ministerial face, sources said that the party wants a ch-ange in the terms of negotiations that have been established over decades between the two partners.

Congress is learned to have given a list of 75 constituencies to RJD with the wish that it should be considered as its tally. While the numbers are an issue, it is the specific seats demanded by Congress that is prolonging the negotiations.

Bihar elections: Full coverage

Some of the seats demanded by Congress are the ones that have a strong RJD base and are high on winnability quotient. The Yadav outfit appears reluctant to part with those seats. Congress feels that if it cannot benefit from the support base of RJD, then the alliance is not sincere.

“The dragging of negotiations to the last minute, which forces Congress to accept less than acceptable terms, has been happening for very long. This time we are serious that this style has to change and RJD should accommodate our demands,” a senior Congress functionary said, adding that “if our demand is not accepted, we can go our way and forge a separate alliance.”

Bihar elections: Live updates

Sources said September-end is the deadline set by Congress for winding up negotiations with RJD.

Top Congress functionaries said that the party is keeping all its options open with a plan B. “We have started talks with NCP, Yashwant Sinha, VIP and RLSP. We have to be ready with an alternative, “ a senior AICC member said. Congress believes that if it breaks with RJD then VIP and RLSP of Upendra Kushwaha will also not leave the alliance since Kushwaha’s objection is to Tejashwi Yadav’s projection.

What is interesting is that while Congress and RJD both are trying hard to finalise the deal, the two partners have still not made a joint public statement to sound the bugle for the election in which they would be taking on the ruling combine of JD(U)-BJP.

24,['27/09/2020'],"7-day average down 9 days in row, is India past peak?","NEW DELHI: The seven-day average of daily Covid-19 cases in India has been steadily falling for nine consecutive days from September 17 to September 26, the first time such a phase of continuous decline has been witnessed since the beginning of the outbreak. Even more hearteningly, this is despite the seven-day average of tests having increased from 10.7 lakh on September 17 to 11.2 lakh on September 25, the last date for which data is available.On September 17, the seven-day average of daily cases had reached 93,199 — the highest since the outbreak of the disease. Since then it has fallen to 85,131, according to data available with European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). There have been previous instances of a fall in the seven-day average of daily cases, but never for more than two consecutive days.On September 17, the seven-day average of daily cases had reached 93,199 — the highest since the outbreak of the disease. Since then it has fallen to 85,131, according to data available with European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). There have been previous instances of a fall in the seven-day average of daily cases, but never for more than two consecutive days.Does it mean that the worst is behind us in India? That would be difficult to say, as a comparison with other countries shows that cases have risen steadily after long stretches of continuous falls. For example, the US reached its first peak on April 11, when the 7-day average of cases reached 31,942. It then fell more or less steadily to reach 20,638 on May 29. It then started rising again to reach another peak on July 20 when the 7-day average was 66,903. It fell again to 34,320 by September 13, but another ongoing surge has taken the average to 44,109 on September 26. Russia, Spain, France and the UK are also witnessing an increase in cases after long, continuous stretches of decline.This, however, also doesn’t mean that the average of cases will definitely increase in India. Among the 10 countries with the highest number of total cases, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and South Africa haven’t so far seen a second peak once their daily averages started falling. Brazil and South Africa reached their peak values of daily cases in end-July and haven’t seen those levels being reached since. Colombia and Mexico reached their peak values in August and there has not been a second wave in these countries as well.We have used 7-day averages rather than single day figures because testing levels and hence also daily cases vary widely from one day to the next. Averaging it out over seven days thus gives a better picture of trends.Data from states suggests India cannot afford to lower its guard yet as some states are going through a decrease in daily average of cases, some are witnessing an increase while there are a few that have seen multiple peaks and troughs.Thankfully, the 7-day average of cases has started to fall in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh , Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, the states that have reported the highest cases so far. Among other large states, poll-bound Bihar is going through a steady decline in cases since the middle of August.Worryingly though, Kerala, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha are witnessing a steady increase in daily cases. Assam, Telangana and Delhi have shown that there can be multiple peaks, highlighting why it’s foolhardy to assume that once cases start dropping they will necessarily continue to do so.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78341896,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-316200,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/7-day-average-down-9-days-in-row-is-india-past-peak/articleshow/78341805.cms

The funds will be routed through the social justice ministry’s “Venture Capital Fund for SCs” which is managed by the IFCI Venture Capital Fund Limited.As per the plan, sources said, the scheme will select ideas from SC and physically challenged youth studying in technological institutes or working in the private sector. The government will handhold them in evolving those ideas into “innovative products, services and solutions”.To achieve the objective, the ASIIM will create a “national social innovation hub” which will tap enterprise development schemes of central ministries and state governments and formulate the outreach policy for the scheme. It will network with governments and chambers of industry, CSR bodies, social enterprises, multilateral aid agencies and international incubation centres to generate support and resources.At the same time, a “business incubator hub” will be set up to take charge of the start-up ideas from Dalit techies and incubate them. The hub will provide support with innovation and finance for three years. Crucially, it will network with “technology business incubators” set up in premier tech institutions in the country to develop the ideas under ASIIM.For the commercial launch, a panel of service providers like chartered accountants, digital marketing, legal advisers will help the SC entrepreneurs.R Subrahmanyam, secretary, social justice and empowerment ministry, said the ideas that mature for launch will be provided assistance through commercial banks, venture capital funds and angel investors, and by the “VCF for SCs” which is an ongoing scheme to fund dalit businesses.",trend-tracking,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78341976,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-63165,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//trend-tracking/centre-plans-1000-dalit-startups-over-3-years/articleshow/78346212.cms

The minister said that the focus on improving the military muscle was in keeping with the Jan Sangh founder’s 6-point vision for national rejuvenation.“Deendayal ji had suggested that the country should be capable of self defence. Very few people know that as a thinker, he had several valuable suggestions on a strategic front other than economy,” the defence minister said. Singh said Upadhyaya had a firm belief that economic policy will be handicapped without the country’s dedicated strategic policy.“No country can be self reliant without paying attention to strategic issues. Only a good, coordinated planning, combining strategic and economic policies can fulfil India’s pledge of becoming self-reliant,” he said.He said the RSS ideologue had suggested that India should become self-reliant in the defence sector in 1962, the time when India had suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of China.Singh said soon after China conducted nuclear tests in 1964, Upadhyaya had suggested that India should also become a nuclear country.“He was the only leader in India who talked about credible nuclear deterrence. When nuclear tests were conducted under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1998, it was done only to demonstrate the country as a nuclear deterrent. That exercise played a vital role in making the armed forces confident,” Rajanth said.Singh spoke about the farm bills saying steps taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have a far-reaching impact on making farmers self-reliant and doubling their income.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78343994,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-671331,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/we-have-parity-with-pla-can-give-befittinng-reply-rajnath-singh/articleshow/78342020.cms

29,['27/09/2020'],"India feels absence of a PM with depth of Manmohan, says Rahul Gandhi","Former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. (Credit: Reuters Photo)

NEW DELHI: On the 88th birthday of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , Congress whipped up its campaign that there was a lack of leadership in the country under the BJP regime, even as it accused the Modi government of betraying farmers and workers.

Wishing the former premier, Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “India feels the absence of a PM with the depth of Dr Manmohan Singh . His honesty, decency and dedication are a source of inspiration for us all.”

Addressing farmers as part of Congress’s online campaign “speak up” against the controversial farm bills, Rahul Gandhi said in a video, “You are being turned into slaves of corporate houses. The three dangerous laws are designed to finish you. I warn the government if farmers take to the streets, it will cause tremendous damage; please withdraw these laws and guarantee the MSP.”

Congress termed the three labour codes brought in by Modi government as “anti-labour”, alleging they have removed the security net available to workers besides weakening the trade unions which provide them a protective umbrella. It said the new laws had again proved that the BJP regime was beholden to corporates and urged all the political parties to oppose them.

Addressing a press conference, AICC leader Mallikarjun Kharge said, “The bills have weakened trade unions and finished the security and safety for the workers. States’ powers have been usurped by the Central government with these laws. These codes are anti-worker, anti-labourer and it is important to agitate against them.”

Indian National Trade Union Congress president G Sanjeeva Reddy said, “We will protest and struggle against these unjust, anti-labour and anti-trade union laws.”

NEW DELHI: After Pakistan PM Imran Khan again raised the Kashmir issue at UNGA, India slammed Pakistan saying terrorism was its only crowning glory. Exercising its Right of Reply, the Indian mission also accused Khan of warmongering and of using the multilateral forum to spread lies, misinformation and malice.

“This august forum witnessed a new low on its 75th anniversary. The leader of Pakistan today called for those who incite hate and violence to be outlawed. But as he went on, we were left wondering, was he referring to himself?” said Mijito Vinito, the first secretary in the permanent mission of India to the UN, Mijito Vinito, exercising India's Right of Reply.

The only crowning glory, he said, that this country has to show to the world for the last 70 years is terrorism, ethnic cleansing , majoritarian fundamentalism and clandestine nuclear trade. “This hall heard the incessant rant of someone who had nothing to show for himself, who had no achievements to speak of and no reasonable suggestion to offer to the world. Instead, we saw lies, misinformation, war mongering and malice spread through this Assembly,” he added.

Pakistan later exercised its right of reply too, in which it claimed that Jammu & Kashmir was never a part of India. Alluding to the “stellar record” of Pakistan, Vinito said this is the country that has the “dubious distinction” of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the United Nations, a reference to terror masterminds such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) head Masood Azhar.

“This is the same country that provides pensions for dreaded and listed terrorists out of state funds. The leader whom we heard today is the same person who referred to terrorist Osama Bin Laden as a ‘martyr’ in the Pakistani Parliament in July,” Vinito said.

He added that it is Pakistan that brought genocide to south Asia 39 years ago when it killed its own people and it is also the country that is “shameless enough” not to offer a sincere apology for the horrors it perpetratedeven after so many years. India asserted in its Right of Reply that Khan, “who spewed venom today”, admitted in 2019 in public in the US that his country still has about 30,000-40,000 terrorists, who have been trained by Pakistan and have fought in Afghanistan and in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.

“This is the country that has systematically cleansed its minorities , including Hindus, Christians, Sikhs and others, through the abuse of its blasphemy laws and through forced religious conversions,” Vinito said.

32,['27/09/2020'],Congress may rope in Prashant Kishor for 2022 Punjab election,"Prashant Kishor (File photo: Reuters)

NEW DELHI: Pollster Prashant Kishor may get to manage Congress in the Punjab elections scheduled for early 2022. Party sources said CM Amarinder Singh is in talks with the former JD(U) member and election strategist, and a decision may be announced soon.

While Kishor is likely to get the contract for advance poll planning in the state, Congress members said he could even get an official perch to manage the affairs. Kishor had widely been credited with helping Congress ride back to power in the state in 2017. A senior AICC manager said the talks are being held by the chief minister and that the party is not involved in the negotiations.

While speculations about Kishor coming on board the Congress campaign in Punjab have been on for a while, it is only now it appears to be reaching a finality. Having been expelled from JD(U) following a scrap with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, Kishor is said to be on the lookout for a new political platform – a reason why there are also speculations that he is looking for an entry in Congress.

Well-placed sources in Congress said Kishor has a direct line with the Gandhi siblings, a reason why not many are willing to hazard a guess about the pollster. There is some confusion in Congress ranks about Kishor.

Sources said a possible reason for CM Singh to get Kishor on board in Punjab would be to ensure that he does not work for Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP, which is set to make a strong pitch in the state in the next polls.

35,['27/09/2020'],Trump announces 'brilliant' conservative judge Barrett as Supreme Court pick,"Donald Trump announces his supreme court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, in the Rose Garden of the White House. (A... Read More



WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Saturday announced conservative appellate judge Amy Coney Barrett as his third U.S. Supreme Court appointment, setting off a scramble in the Republican-led Senate to confirm her before Election Day in 5-1/2 weeks.

Barrett appeared at the White House with Trump as he made the announcement.

""Today it is my honor to nominate one of our nation's most brilliant and gifted legal minds to the Supreme Court,"" Trump said.

Turning to Barrett, Trump said that ""you are very eminently qualified for the job."" She and her lawyer husband have seven children, two of whom were adopted from Haiti, and they joined her at the ceremony in the White House Rose Garden.

If confirmed to replace liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died at age 87 on Sept. 18, Barrett would become the fifth woman ever to serve on the top U.S. judicial body and push its conservative majority to a commanding 6-3. With Trump's fellow Republicans controlling the Senate, confirmation appears certain, though Democrats may try to make the process as difficult as possible.

""I love the United States and I love the United States Constitution,"" Barrett said, adding that she was ""deeply honored"" in the confidence that Trump had shown in her.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement Saturday praising the nomination.

""Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an exceptionally impressive jurist and an exceedingly well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States,"" McConnell said.

Barrett, 48, was appointed by Trump to the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 and is a favorite of religious conservatives, a key Trump voter bloc. Conservative activists have hailed Trump's selection, which surfaced on Friday night, while liberals have voiced dismay.

Like Trump's two other appointees, Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, Barrett is young enough that she could serve for decades. Barrett is the youngest Supreme Court nominee since conservative Clarence Thomas was 43 in 1991.

The White House ceremony was decorated with American flags arranged in a way similar to the day when President Bill Clinton nominated Ginsburg in 1993.

The selection kicks off a flurry of activity that must take place before the final confirmation vote, including public hearings in the coming weeks before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

A White House source said the nominee on Tuesday will begin the traditional courtesy calls on individual senators in their offices, with McConnell up first. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone is expected to shepherd the nomination.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, who mounted an angry defense of Kavanaugh during tense confirmation hearings in 2018, has signaled he expects to have Barrett confirmed as a justice by the Nov. 3 election in which Trump is seeking a second term.

Democrats are still furious over McConnell's 2016 refusal to consider President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland because it came during an election year. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has said the winner of the election should get to replace Ginsburg.

Republicans hold a 53-47 Senate majority. Only two Republican senators have opposed proceeding with the confirmation process.

Abortion rights advocates have voiced concern that Barrett, a devout Roman Catholic, could cast a vote for overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion nationwide.

Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, an anti-abortion group, in a statement on Saturday expressed confidence that Barrett ""will fairly apply the law and Constitution as written, which includes protecting the most vulnerable in our nation: our unborn children.""

Brian Burch, president of CatholicVote, a faith-based advocacy group, added, ""Catholics are thrilled with the expected nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett and believe she represents the best choice to protect the rule of law and our constitutional rights.""

Abortion rights groups and other liberal-leaning organizations announced plans for a protest against her nomination on Sunday in front of the Supreme Court.

Barrett has staked out conservative legal positions in three years on the bench, voting in favor of one of Trump's hardline immigration policies and showing support for expansive gun rights. She also authored a ruling making it easier for college students accused of campus sexual assaults to sue their institutions.

Born in New Orleans, Barrett received her law degree from Notre Dame Law School, a Catholic institution in Indiana.

The other finalist mentioned by Trump to fill the vacancy was Barbara Lagoa, a Cuban-American federal appeals court judge from Florida who he appointed last year.

ELECTION-RELATED CASES

Trump has said he wants his nominee confirmed before the election so she would be able participate in any election-related cases that reach the justices, potentially casting a key vote in his favor. A U.S. presidential election's outcome only once has been determined by the Supreme Court, in 2000 when it clinched Republican George W. Bush's victory over Democrat Al Gore.

Trump has repeatedly without evidence said voting by mail, a regular feature of American elections, will lead to voter fraud. He also has refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the election.

This marks the first time since 1956 that a U.S. president has moved to fill a Supreme Court vacancy so close to an election. In that year, President Dwight Eisenhower three weeks before winning re-election placed William Brennan on the court using a procedure called a ""recess appointment"" that bypassed the Senate, a tactic no longer available for installing justices.

An emboldened Supreme Court conservative majority could shift the United States to the right on hot-button issues by, among other things, curbing abortion rights, expanding religious rights, striking down gun control laws, and endorsing new restrictions on voting rights.

36,['27/09/2020'],"ISI has a fearful reputation but I found plenty of evidence of flat-footed spies, says US author",", the Cairo bureau chief for The New York Times, reported on the heady events of Pakistan from 2004 to May 2013 when he was suddenly expelled. In an interview to

Himanshi Dhawan

about his new book ‘The

: Dispatches from a Divided Nation’, Walsh talks about why Pakistan is not a failed state, and Imran’s disappointing tenure

Why did you choose to tell the story of Pakistan through nine encounters? Do they represent the good, the bad and the ugly side of the country?

The book says Pakistan is in the clutches of the three Cs: conflict, crisis and contradictions. Which do you feel is the most dangerous to its existence?

Pakistan is widely believed to be a “failed state” by the international community. And yet you demur from this description in the book. Why? Do you think there is any hope of Imran Khan realising the vision of Naya Pakistan ?

Pakistan is getting closer to China as India’s ties with it worsen. How do you see these relationships progressing?

You have been scathing in your description of Pakistan’s spy agency ISI as bungling and corrupt and its military generals as more property dealers and less masters of strategy and war. With these two apparently running the country, is there any room for optimism?

You were asked to leave the country abruptly over an article. Many prominent Pakistani journalists, including those who helped you, and civil rights activists have been threatened, slapped with treason cases, killed or have suddenly disappeared. Do you find that the space for dissent has become increasingly restricted?

You have spoken at length about the religious extremism in Pakistan and how it has been used as a ploy by the military and political class for its own gains. Do you find parallels of that in India today?

How do you reconcile contradictions in the country, where a schoolgirl like Malala is shot while Aafia Siddiqui, also known as Lady Al Qaeda, is given the moniker 'qaum ki beti' and inspires protests demanding her release from a US prison?

Telling the story of any country is a daunting challenge but I realised the best way to do that was through the lives of the Pakistanis I met along the way because that’s also how I made sense of the place. How they lived, thrived, clashed and, in many cases, died amid the dim and smoke of the events exploding around them, not only brought the story to life — it provided a way to make sense of the glorious chaos of Pakistan.Undoubtedly, the contradictions. I’ve written on Jinnah and the politics of pre-partition India, because I felt it was crucially important to explain how those heady, confused and often tragic events continue to inform much of Pakistan’s trajectory today. Confusion over the role of religion, arguments over what it means to be a Pakistani, the military’s way of thinking — so much is rooted in that historical moment. Every country is a prisoner of its history, of course, but the Pakistani case is acute. You could make a similar case for India. I was struck by how Partition is commemorated in both countries, but never really examined. Perhaps it still strikes too close to the bone.I don’t know that an international body or government has made such a “failed state” determination — and if they have, I’m even less sure it’s a very useful way of looking at the country. No doubt, Pakistan is a country with a troubled history, deep structural flaws, and a political system that is badly warped by the lopsided balance of power between civilian and military actors. The lethal mix of jihadis, nukes and preening, power-hungry generals is a legacy of the Zia era that came to haunt the country after 9/11. But it’s equally important to recognise that Pakistan’s generals don’t have an entirely free hand. The country’s size, diversity and political culture mitigate against Arab-style autocracy. And its democracy — or, in times of military rule, its democratic impulses — has proven incredibly resilient.In theory, Imran Khan should be pushing the needle towards stability. He came to power by inspiring millions of Pakistanis with his lofty rhetoric and promises to clean up politics. But in power he’s been far less bold, and has ceded control of key issues — Afghanistan, India and the Taliban, among others — to the army, leaving him to steward an ailing economy.Even Khan’s most fervent supporters might concede that he has not delivered the promised new dawn.You can’t look at these three countries in isolation, playing out their strategic games across the Himalayas, without seeing the US as the silent dance partner in the corner. For decades, Pakistan hitched its wagons to Washington as a source of guns and cash. Today the Chinese have taken up the economic side of that assistance but Pakistan would like to maintain its security relationship with the US, which has far more sophisticated weapons to offer. The border clashes between India and China this year will be music to Pakistani ears, of course. And it’s striking how not only Imran Khan, but also many Pakistanis have been silent on the persecution of the Uighurs in Xinjiang. Determined not to derail the relationship with China, Khan has pretended not to see, while railing against abuses of Muslims elsewhere. I guess it’s also a sign of how central China has become to Pakistani calculations.Whether the ISI are geniuses or jokers really depends on who you ask. Inside Pakistan, the agency has a fearful reputation for meddling and skulduggery that is warranted. The ISI itself does little to dispel that reputation — fear is a powerful weapon. Seen from the outside, the picture is less impressive. I found plenty of evidence of flat-footed spies. And it’s certainly true that Pakistan’s generals have powerful financial incentives, such as land allocations, that encourage them to entrench their power. What really counts, though, is not the street level stuff, be it bungling or brilliant, but the strategic calculations of the men in charge. Historically, the army and the ISI have made some very poor calls — allying in the 1980s and 1990s with the jihadi groups that turned guns on Pakistan over the past 15 years, for instance. The question now is what lessons they have learned from these mistakes, and whether they are capable of course correction.Absolutely. When I was expelled in 2013, it was quite rare for the government to take that kind of direct, overt action against a reporter. In retrospect, it was only a sign of things to come for my Pakistani colleagues. It’s very regrettable. When I arrived, in 2004, I was struck by how the country had such a diverse, often irreverent press. There were red lines, certainly, but inside those lines there was a great deal of space. In recent years, and particularly under Imran Khan, that space has been lost in spectacular fashion. Critical reporters are abducted from central Islamabad in broad daylight, TV shows are yanked off air mid-interview, newspapers are starved of government advertising revenue. It’s a very tough time.It’s hard to avoid them. During the period I lived in Islamabad, progressives who otherwise lauded Muhammad Ali Jinnah were quietly dismissive of “two-nation theory” that underpinned the foundation of Pakistan. Now many of those same people are wondering aloud if the old man was right all along. Recent developments in India, whether its repression in Kashmir, lynchings of Muslim cow traders, riots in Delhi or discriminatory new laws, point to Indian leaders intent on stoking the same divisions as Pakistan’s Islamists. For all its flaws, India had always prided itself on being a secular democracy, and avoiding the pitfalls of Pakistan. It’s alarming that under Mr. Modi seems to be tumbling headlong into them.The shooting of Malala and the lionization of Aafia Siddiqui are different manifestations of the same phenomenon: the wave of extremism that surged across Pakistan in the late 2000s. What’s just as important is the strength of the countervailing forces – the human rights defenders like the great Asma Jahangir, who died a few years ago. Pakistan’s destiny lies partly in the battle between those opposing forces.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78338250,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-34646,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/isi-has-a-fearful-reputation-but-i-found-plenty-of-evidence-of-flat-footed-spies-says-us-author/articleshow/78338245.cms
37,['27/09/2020'],Digital hiring in education sector is growing despite pandemic,"Moving towards the digital has only been accelerated by the pandemic, particularly in the case of the education sector. LinkedIn research into the pace and nature of digitisation in India shows that there is a growing demand for digital talent across all sectors, particularly education. Analysing LinkedIn Economic Graph data between 2016 and June 2020, they looked at the rate of hiring those who have listed digital skills on their profiles, compared to those have listed at least one skill, digital or otherwise.While there is a growing demand for digital skills including travel and corporate services, they observed a rapid increase in demand for digital talent in the education space starting in 2019. It has grown 2x since 2016-2017. While all other sectors have seen a dip in hiring starting from January 2020, the education sector continued to see accelerated growth Within the education space, e-learning is unsurprisingly the sub-sector that has seen most growth in digital hiring during the pandemic. “The E-learning sub sector experienced a 5X growth in proportion of digital hires: While in 2016, only 7% of the digital hires were in the E-learning space, in 2020 this number shot up to 33%,” states the LinkedIn report.EdTech companies and online training portals make up the top 10 employers hiring digital professionals in education. In terms of who is being hired, business developers and software engineers with digital skills are growing faster than academia-related roles in the education space, comparing the proportion of digital hires in 2016 to 2020. “In 2020, 9 out of the top 10 unique skills held by digital professionals are related to programming skills (C, C++, Java, HTML) and disruptive tech skills (Artificial Intelligence). These skills are critical to build and develop online learning technologies,” the research states.Vamsi Krishna, CEO and co-founder of edtech company Vedantu says, “Covid-19 has steered in an era of online learning and has shown tremendous potential in recent times. While the entire EdTech industry is witnessing a shift, the number of subscribers on Vedantu’s platform has grown exponentially to 2.5 million with collections and revenue which grew by 80%. As a responsible company, it is our duty to ensure that all the students and teachers get a perfect experience of our product and hence we are ramping up our team with hirings across all levels.”The gender gap in hiring in the education sector is closing at a slower rate than in other fields of work, the research found. 35% of the hires in the education sector are women. According to the LinkedIn research, “While there has been a 24% growth in the proportion of women digital talent at country level (in 2020 compared to 2016), we do not see a similar pace in growth in hiring of female digital talent in the education industry: 8% growth in proportion of women digital talent in the education sector.” As the demand for digital skills grows, there is a risk of it further slowing down the closing of the gender gap. This underlines the importance of upskilling female talent with digital skills.This trend spells good news for younger people -- it was found that the demand for Gen Z digital talent in the education industry is growing faster than the overall demand for Gen Z digital talent.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78337649,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2707904,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/digital-hiring-in-education-sector-is-growing-despite-pandemic/articleshow/78337640.cms

WASHINGTON: Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Saturday called on the US Senate to refrain from confirming President Donald Trump 's Supreme Court nominee until after the November 3 election.

""The Senate should not act on this vacancy until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress,"" Biden said, just moments after Trump announced his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to replace the late liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Trump predicted that Barrett, a staunch conservative, will get a ""very quick"" confirmation in the Republican-controlled senate.

Barrett is ""a jurist with a written track record of disagreeing with the Court's decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act,"" the healthcare plan known as Obamacare that was adopted when Biden was vice president, the Democrat said in a statement.

Trump has been trying to end Obamacare ""for four years,"" Biden said, but twice the Supreme Court ""upheld the law as constitutional.

""But even now, in the midst of a global health pandemic, the Trump Administration is asking the US Supreme Court to overturn the entire law, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions,"" Biden said.

However, considering that there is under reporting of fatalities and injuries, the study has also projected loss to the tune of Rs 5.9 lakh crore, which is 3.1% of the GDP.The study was carried out by the TRIPP of IIT(Delhi) and DIMTS, which has come out with three different estimates of the socio-economic impact under three scenarios. The third estimate is based on the Global Burden of Disease (GDB) Study and the impact has been estimated close to Rs 8.63 lakh crore.This is the second such study after 1999 to quantify the total economic loss due to road crashes, fatalities and injuries. Such studies are carried out across the world frequently to prepare strategies to see how with less investment in creating safe infrastructure and enforcement rules, huge cost in terms of lives and the socio-economic loss can be prevented. The report is yet to be made public and the ministry is going through the report.Sources said the estimates have been calculated taking into account medical expenses, loss of income which is also known as lost output cost, pain, grief and suffering, damage to vehicle, public asset and administrative costs. The total impact in financial terms has been arrived at using the human capital approach method, which uses the present value of expected future earnings to estimate the potential loss to society, if an individual dies or becomes permanently disabled. It has also taken into account other studies across the globe and also in India.TOI has learnt that major share in the socio economic impact of fatalities in road crashes is on account of lost output cost, which is nearly Rs 74 lakh per person while in the case of grievous injuries more than 50% of the share of the cost is towards medical expenses.The report has also highlighted how the share of victim-related costs is about 98% of the total cost of road crashes and 70% of the entire accident cost is towards victims in the age group of 18-45 years.Sources said the study was done after collecting primary data from police stations across 14 cities and 53 hospitals spread across 20 cities.It has also revealed that 78% of the cost of all accident victims is towards two-wheeler drivers and pedestrians, who are most vulnerable and need attention of the government to improve enforcement of laws, improving infrastructure and healthcare services.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78342166,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-187008,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/socio-economic-cost-of-a-road-death-91l-3-6l-for-those-grievously-injured/articleshow/78342159.cms

NEW DELHI: Kicking off the first virtual bilateral summit in the neighbourhood, India and Sri Lanka sought to advance defence and security cooperation, while India promised to consider Colombo’s request for delayed debt repayment and a $1 billion currency swap arrangement.

PM Modi met his Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa virtually on Saturday morning. According to an official readout of the summit by MEA joint secretary ( Indian Ocean Region ) Amit Narang, PM Modi emphasised that implementation of the 13th amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution is essential for carrying forward the process of peace and reconciliation.

“PM Modi called on the new government in Sri Lanka to work towards realising the expectations of Tamils for equality, justice, peace and dignity within a united Sri Lanka by achieving reconciliation nurtured by implementation of the constitutional provisions,” he said.

Narang added India’s focus areas with Sri Lanka are defence and security, Buddhism and economic development. “The outcomes of the Summit are substantial, forward looking and also help to set an ambitious agenda for bilateral ties,” he said.

“Under neighbourhood first policy and SAGAR Doctrine, we will give priority to Sri Lanka,” Modi told his counterpart in his opening remarks. Sri Lanka has requested for a $1 billion currency swap arrangement with India (India had, earlier this year, done a $400 million swap) and a delayed debt repayment schedule. India agreed to support Sri Lanka in defence and security, “strengthen the mutual cooperation on personnel exchange and training, maritime security cooperation.” Indian Coast Guard and Indian Navy recently helped to douse a major fire on a tanker MT Diamond off the Lankan coast .

However, there was no word on whether the Eastern Container Terminal (ECT) deal, which Rajapaksa had promised to review, would go to India and Japan as originally agreed. There was also no meeting point on the impasse regarding the Trincomalee container terminals, which has been hanging fire. Questioned, Narang stuck to generalities about the discussions being “positive and constructive.”

Modi also announced a grant assistance of $15 million for the promotion of Buddhist ties between the two countries. Rajapaksa invited Modi to inaugurate the Jaffa Cultural Centre, set up with Indian assistance. Narang indicated that India shared its assessments of the Ladakh crisis with the Lankan leadership.

Vadodara: The controversy over closing one of the gates of Samarpan residential society on Vasna road has snowballed into a court battle as one of the residents has alleged that 15 residents, among whom are also office-bearers of the society, closed the gate with support of the police inspector D K Vaghela and town development officer Jitesh Trivedi, closed access of a nine-metre road which is part of civic body’s town planning (TP) scheme. Vinay Shah also filed an application against the 15 other residents, inspector of JP Road police station and town development officer of Vadodara Municipal Corporation in this regard.

The complainant has requested the court to pass an order for registering an offence under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code and the Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Ordinance for allegedly grabbing a public road and a plot reserved by VMC for a playground.

Shah approached the court on September 19 as his and other residents’ complaint were not taken up by police department.

In his complaint, Shah said that by closing the gate, they have also barred the access to the playground, Shah said. The gate was closed on August 17. On September 10, the land estate branch of the civic body had given a notice to the office-bearers of the society to remove the gate from the road. However, no action was taken after that.

Shah has also stated in his complaint that to grab the land the residents have tried to create differences between people from two different religions living in the society.

“They have restricted public from accessing a TP road which is the property of VMC and not of society. After closing the gate, a stretch of 182 metre is now being used for their personal use as a walking track, which is illegal,” said Shah’s advocate S F Khatri.

The society has remained in controversy as just last month one of the property owners in it had concealed his religion to sell the property to a person from another religion. In November last year too, a businessman had to call off the deal to sell his bungalow to a person from the minority community, following angry protests by other residents.

The society falls under Gujarat Prohibition of Transfer of Immovable Property and Provision for Protection of Tenants from Eviction from Premises in Disturbed Areas Act prohibits sale of property in an area covered under the act to a person from different religion without permission from the district collector.

43,['27/09/2020'],Citizens seen red over rising prices of green,"Surat: As if Covid-19 pandemic was not enough , the skyrocketing prices of vegetables are now adding to people’s troubles.

In the last few of days, the prices of most vegetables have almost doubled because of the shortage of fresh stock due to heavy rains in Maharashtra and South Gujarat region, which has destroyed the standing crops at several places.

Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) sources said the supply in the market yard has decreased by almost 40% in the last few days, resulting in the spike of vegetables in the wholesale and the retail markets.

Prices of commonly consumed vegetables like cluster beans, French beans, cabbage and even brinjal have almost tripled in the retail market. The green peas, which were selling for Rs 70 per kg till last week, has increased to Rs 240 per kg.

APMC secretary Nilesh Thorat told TOI, “Against the requirement of about 3,000 tonnes vegetables per day, the market yard is getting just about 1,700 tonnes. Heavy rain in Maharashtra and south Gujarat destroyed the standing crop. The supply to expected to normalize only after a month.”

Thorat added, “The wholesale prices have appreciated by about 15-20% in the last three days in all the vegetable varieties due to the shortage. However, the retailers in the vegetable markets have increased the prices three to four times the wholesale rates.”

Munna Patel, a vegetable vendor at Adajan vegetable market said, “The quality of vegetables dumped in the market yard is also poor. We are not allowed to sort the vegetables at the APMC. We have to purchase at least 20 kg. If the quality of vegetables is not good, we have to bear the losses. W have no option but to increase our prices.

With this altogether four people have been arrested in the drug racket so far.

Police are now focusing on how the drug was being manufactured in the unit that it had raided in Kadodara.

Police arrested Pragnesh Pravin Thummar, 31, a resident of L H Road in Varachha, and Mohammad Sufiyan alias Baba Ashraf Memon, 30, a resident of Adaja. Cops produced duo in the court on Saturday and got their remand till September 30.

So far police investigation has revealed that Thummar had played a key role in the drug manufacturing unit run by accused Sanket Aslaliya, who was arrested earlier.

“Thummar had trained Aslaliya to make the drugs and also guided him to source the material from various chemical units. He also taught him how to sell the finished product in the market,” said a police officer.

Thummar got a share in the profit from the total drugs produced and sold by Aslaliya. Police are investigating if Thummar, who has a bachelors degree in pharmacy and has knowledge of chemicals, also produced drugs at some other locations as well, police informed.

The other accused, Memon, used to purchase the drugs from Salman in small quantities and sold it to his regular buyers. “Memon used to charge as per the buyer’s financial condition and is suspected to have made a good amount by selling drugs during the lockdown,” said police.

Incidentally, the BJP, along with its another major partner JD(U) in the NDA, has been claiming that the Grand Alliance (GA) is in complete disarray, as first the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi walked out of it and now the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) led by Upendra Kushwaha is planning to follow the suit.

Asked about Chirag’s “vitriolic attacks” on Nitish, senior BJP leader and Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Saturday, “The NDA is one. It will contest the assembly elections together. If there is some problem anywhere, it will be sorted out.”

As to the divergent note sounded by Chirag, at least with regard to the NDA’s CM face and also his claim to contest 143 of the 243 assembly seats in the state, Prasad said, “The LJP is in the NDA at the Centre. In Bihar, it contested the 2015 assembly elections and 2019 parliamentary elections as an NDA partner.”

Prasad was talking to mediapersons here a day after the announcement of election dates by chief election commissioner Sunil Arora. “I am happy that we have put together the digital medium to communicate with people, which our leaders have been doing regularly,” Prasad said.

“I am confident that the people of the state will give decisive victory to the NDA in the assembly elections,” he added.

I came here (JDU office) to meet CM Nitish and thank him for giving me absolute freedom in performing my duties as the DGP,” Pandey told mediapersons.When asked whether he would contest from Buxar assembly constituency or Bagaha, Pandey said, “I have yet not taken any decision on contesting polls.”Though the former DGP is keeping his cards close to the chest, political circles in Bihar are agog with speculations that Pandey, a Brahmin, would contest either assembly polls from any Brahmin-dominated constituency in Bhojpur or Buxar district, or the parliamentary byelection from Valmikinagar seat, which fell vacant after the death of JD(U)’s MP Baidyanath Prasad Mahato.Sources said Pandey, a native of Buxar, would most probably be the NDA candidate either from Buxar or Brahmapur or Shahpur in the neighbouring Bhojpur district. All these three are Brahmin-dominated assembly constituencies.“In the 2015 assembly election, the grand alliance had won all these three seats against BJP candidates. If these seats fall in the BJP kitty among the NDA partners, Pandey may be asked to join BJP to contest from either of the seats. This is the reason why Pandey is not disclosing his next move,” a senior NDA leader told TOI on Saturday.A senior JD(U) leader said the ruling party was also considering Pandey’s name for the parliamentary bypoll from Valmikinagar, but a final decision would be taken by the top NDA leaders as RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha has now expressed his desire to contest that seat after joining the NDA camp.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78342698,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-233783,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/bihar-assembly-elections-2020/ex-dgp-meets-nitish-triggers-speculations/articleshow/78339609.cms

RAJKOT: A 50-year-old lawyer was stabbed to death in his office on a busy road in Rapar town of Kutch district on Friday late evening, allegedly over taking up a case pertaining to a property dispute involving two warring factions of a community.

Devji Maheshwari, who had been practising for the past two decades, parked his car outside his ground floor office on a busy road. Just when Maheshwari entered the office, one man followed him and stabbed him repeatedly. CCTV images show the man following him. Maheshwari died minutes after being hospitalized.

On Saturday, the assailant identified as Bharat Rawal was nabbed from Mumbai by a team of Kutch police and Mumbai crime branch. In all, six people have been detained for the murder.

Mayur Patil, superintendent of police Kutch (east), told TOI: “We had specific information that the prime accused seen in the CCTV footage following Maheshwari had escaped to Mumbai as he works there. We sent one team to Mumbai on Friday evening and nabbed him with the help of the local crime branch. He will be brought here by Sunday morning.”

Police said that Rawal had specially come down to Rapar to commit the murder. Ten teams formed by the Kutch police also nabbed Jaysukh Luhar, Khimji Luhar, Dhaval Luhar, Devubha Sodha and Mayursinh Vaghela who were named in the complaint lodged by Maheshwari's wife Meenakshi.

Officials said the dispute was regarding the sale of Luhar community hall by its officebearers to some other community. One faction of the community, however, was against the sale. The members of both factions had also lodged cross-complaints alleging physical assault and vandalizing the property 10 days ago. Maheshwari had taken up the case of the faction that opposed the property sale.

Maheshwari’s murder had sparked off angry protests by the Dalit community members who had blocked several roads across Kutch district including Bhuj-Lakhpat highway, Gandhidham town, Madhapar village and Mundra , demanding justice.

Inspector general of police (IGP), border range, JR Mothaliya said the exact motive of the murder will established once the accused are interrogated.

Maheshwari was also a member of All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation (BAMCEF) and Gujarat in-charge Indian National Association of Legal Professionals, said Waman Meshram, national president of BAMCEF, in a statement.

49,['27/09/2020'],Surat may lose its two low-cost fabric varieties to Maharashtra,"SURAT: Surat’s loss is Bhiwandi’s gain. An acute shortage of migrant workers in the country’s largest man-made fabric (MMF) industry may translate into a huge loss for the powerloom weavers.The reason: The manufacturing of two important fabric varieties including ultra satin and sand crepe —non-twisted fabric varieties — are likely to be shifted to the powerloom weaving clusters in Bhiwandi and Navapur in Maharashtra .According to the powerloom weavers, out of the total 25,000 powerloom weavers in Surat, only 400 weavers are manufacturing sand crepe and ultra satin fabrics. Surat’s powerloom industry is the largest supplier of ultra satin and sand crepe fabrics in the country.The ultra satin fabrics are used in mandap cover, tent cover and gate for wedding receptions and ladies garments including gown and saris. On the other hand, the sand crepe fabrics are used in the manufacturing of inner wears and beach wear garments.Post lockdown, about 80% of the powerloom units manufacturing the fabric variety are yet to reopen due to the acute shortage of workers. The 20% units, which have been made operational post-lockdown, are manufacturing less than 1 lakh metre of fabric per month.During the pre-Covid times, the monthly production of ultra satin and sand crèpe fabric put together was pegged at 30 lakh metres worth Rs 6 crore.Chairman of Federation of Indian Art Silk Weaving Industry (FIASWI) Bharat Gandhi told TOI: “Surat is the largest supplier of beach wear and mandap fabrics. The production of fabric has come to a standstill in Surat due to the acute shortage of workers.”Gandhi added, “On the other hand, the wholesale markets in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, which are the biggest customers of satin and crepe fabric are yet to reopen. It is feared that if this continues for long, then Surat may lose its fabric varieties to neighbouring clusters of Bhiwandi and Navapur.”The manufacturing of sand crepe and ultra satin fabric is done by the skilled workers from Odisha. Since it is a non-twisted fabric and low-cost variety, powerloom weavers in other centres in Bhiwandi and Navapur are yet to lay their hands on it.The reason why ultra satin and crepe fabric are manufactured in Surat is the fact that Surat is the biggest manufacturer of specialised polyester yarn used in the fabric. The easy availability of raw material has given the edge to the powerloom weavers of Surat from other centres.Rajnish Lilah, a powerloom weaver manufacturing ultra satin fabric in its unit in Udhana, said, “In the pre-Covid times, we were manufacturing 50,000 metres of Ultra Satin fabric per month. I have not reopened the unit post-lockdown due to the shortage of workers. Ultra Satin fabric is the cheapest variety sold for Rs 20 per metre and that the wholesalers in Delhi and Mumbai want us to supply for less than Rs 15 per metre. However, we have kept the unit shut.”“Other powerloom centres including Bhiwandi, Navapur, Malegaon , Ichalkaranji,Ludhinia, Panipat and Varanasi have improved their operational efficiency by almost 80%. Surat’s powerloom sector is still lagging behind with just 45% capacity. However, the low-cost varieties of ultra satin and sand crepe may migrate to the neighbouring centres in Maharashtra in the coming days due to the acute shortage of workers.” Ashish Gujarati | president of Pandesara Weavers Association (PWA)“My 48 powerloom machines are shut post-lockdown due to the shortage of skilled workers from Odisha. The production of ultra satin fabric has come to a grinding halt.

50,['27/09/2020'],Study likely to help in treatment of fluoride-contaminated water,"Representative image

PATNA: Alum , locally known as ‘fitkari’ and a compound of aluminium, has long been used as ‘aftershave’ by common man owing to its antiseptic property. Now, yet another compound of aluminium — alumina — is likely to find even a greater use in the treatment of fluoride-contaminated water soon.

The findings of a recent study made jointly by the scientists of Nalanda University (NU) and Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU) have revealed that alumina could be a favourable material for optimal removal of fluoride ions from waste water. Adsorption of fluoride is a sophisticated but cheaper technology that requires adoption of suitable design and operational parameters for wastewater treatment, according to the study.

The findings of the research made by Rakesh Kumar and Prabhakar Sharma of School of Ecology and Environment Studies at NU and Abhay Kumar Aman and Rakesh Kumar Singh of the Centre for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology at AKU have been published in the September issue of international journal ‘Desalination and Water Treatment’.

Giving details of the findings, Rakesh said alumina is a ceramic oxide having the extensive potential for water purification, as it possesses unique properties, including high surface area and sorption capacity. The most important property of the compound on nano scale found during research was that an electromagnetic force becomes dominant between activated alumina and fluoride ions and due to this reason activated alumina was found to be a good adsorbent for wastewater treatment.

“X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy measurements indicated that materials in nano metre range facilitated fluoride desorption due to strong electromagnetic force and ion exchange. The reusability of activated alumina adsorbent makes the fluoride sorption cost-effective. So, the outcomes in this study establish that activated alumina can be efficient and appropriate adsorbent for sorption of fluoride ions from the contaminated water,” he said.

About 26 crore people are affected by fluoride contamination globally, including a sizeable population in India. The people of as many as 12 districts of Bihar, including Aurangabad, Banka, Buxar, Gaya, Jamui, Kaimur, Munger, Nawada, Rohtas and Supaul, are drinking fluoride-contaminated water (water having fluoride concentration in excess of the permissible limit of 1.5 mg/l). If this recent method of treatment of fluoride contaminated water is successful in treating the contaminated water at an affordable cost, it would certainly prove a boon for the poor people of the state, said Geological Survey of India’s retired director N Dayal.

51,['27/09/2020'],Bihar: 35 lakh first-time voters to play key role this election,"Representative image

PATNA: More than 7.29 crore people, including 3.39 crore women and 2,344 third gender, will exercise their franchise in the three-phase state assembly elections, the schedule for which was announced by the Commission of India (ECI) on Friday.

At least 35 lakh voters will participate in the democratic exercise for the first time in the state, ECI sources said.

Abhishek Anand, a resident of A G Colony here and a first-time voter, said he would cast his vote in favour of the candidate who has the vision to ensure proper sanitation and cleanliness in the city. “Garbage collection does take place, but it is not properly organised. Waterlogging is a perennial problem in our locality,” he said.

Abhishek Dhar of Ashiana Nagar said flood menace in north Bihar, waterlogging and sanitation issues would drive his voting choice. “We in Patna are still safe. However, those living in north Bihar districts suffer from floods every year. This needs to be resolved,” he said. Dhar said he voted for first time in 2019 general election and it would be his first assembly election as a voter.

Pragya Jha, who will exercise her franchise in Saharsa, said her choice would be the one who addresses the issue of unemployment. “The results of an examination conducted by Bihar Staff Selection Commission two years ago are still pending,” she added.

Anju Shrivastava, a housewife from A G Colony, said though liquor prohibition, girl education and discouraging dowry were some of the good steps taken by the state government, their implementation could have been better.

Another housewife, Neeta Sinha from Gardanibagh, said the next government should bring necessary changes to usher in all-round development in the state. “Liquor prohibition has not shown desired results at the ground level yet,” she said.

Sociologist D M Diwakar said this election would be decisive for Nitish Kumar. “Anti-incumbency and reverse migration would be major factors. Those who had returned during lockdown have some expectations from the next government,” Diwakar said.

“For young voters, employment, education and timely examinations are major factors. “There is lack of teachers in government schools and colleges yet. Educated youths should realise that there are still employment opportunities for them in state,” Diwakar added.

He said development would also be a big issue. “There is no doubt that road connectivity and power supply have improved in the state. However, there is no respite from flood menace in the state yet and agricultural growth has also remained poor. Crop growth rate is negative in the state. The fact that Nitish has supported passage of farm Bills in the Parliament will have an impact on the election,” he said.

GAYA: Preventive action against 16,485 people under Section 107 has been proposed by different police stations in Gaya district to ensure free and fair elections. As many as 626 licenced firearms have been deposited at different police stations.

District magistrate-cum-district election officer Abhishek Singh has asked police officers to ensure verification of all the licenced firearms.

Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Rajiv Mishra has also asked the station house officers (SHOs) to intensify vehicle-checking drive by making check-post in front of the police station.

A workshop was organised by expenditure and monitoring cell to impart training to officials of flying squad team (FST) and the static surveillance team (SST) constituted for the elections. Addressing the workshop, the DM asked the staff on duty at district control room to answer each phone call, failing which strict action would be taken against staff or the official concerned. He asked the officials of FST and the SST to download cVIGIL app in their cellphones for effective monitoring of election-related activities.

The DM also held a meeting with representatives of affiliated political parties on Saturday to discuss code of conduct, permission procedure for election campaign meetings, rallies, road show and other modes of campaigning. “For convenience to seek permission, a single-window system is available here. Not more than 100 people will be allowed to participate in a rally or a road show at a time. For the voters above 80 years of age, physically challenged and Covid-affected, postal ballot facility will be available. Such voters will have to submit application in form 12 B to avail the facility,” the DM said according to a press communique issued by the district administration.

Nominations for 10 assembly segments in the district can be filed from October 1 to 8. Only two people will be allowed with the candidate filing nomination. October 12 is the last date for withdrawal of nomination in the district.

Voting will be held at 3,108 main booths and 1,322 additional booths on October 28 from 7am to 6pm. In Maoist-hit areas, the voting will be held from 7am to 4pm. The 10 assembly segments in the district have 29,00,691 voters, including 13,99,755 women.

PATNA: The initial round of seat-sharing talks between BJP and RLSP led by Upendra Kushwaha has begun. No conditions have been put on board by either side, RLSP sources said.

Asked for his comment on the seat-sharing talks, a top RLSP source said on Saturday, “I do not deny it.”

Yet another source said if things moved smoothly, the agreement reached over the seats to be shared by the RLSP would be in the public domain “in the next one or two days”. He also indicated that it would be finally resolved in Delhi.

Asked as to how many seats the RLSP has demanded, the source said, “It is too early to say how many seats would be given to the RLSP to contest. Initial round of talks has been held and will continue further.”

“In two days, we will be able to say anything concrete on the matter. In politics, doors are not closed,” he added.

Incidentally, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora announced the poll schedule on Friday, noting that the notification for the first phase of the election will be issued on October 1.

At the state BJP headquarters on Saturday, when Union minister and BJP’s publicity incharge Ravi Shankar Prasad was asked if the outcome of the seat-sharing talks among the NDA partners would be known before October 1, he said, “You know how things are done.”

Incidentally, Kushwaha quit the grand alliance this week over the issue of the delay in the seat-sharing talks with RJD. The unstated reason, as political observers said, was that Kushwaha had been demanding 36 seats to contest, but RJD was willing to concede only 12.

By that token, BJP may not give more than 10 seats to RLSP, while it had contested 22 seats in the 2015 assembly election as an NDA partner, observers felt.

Sources said the RJD top brass had also wanted to know the RLSP’s likely candidates for the seats it had been seeking. Kushwaha did not savour and digest and, accordingly, walked out of the Mahagathbandhan.

Speaking on the occasion, ECR GM L C Trivedi said the plant has the capacity to contain at least 500kg kitchen and other solid waste materials per day. He also administered an oath to railway employees deployed at Patna Junction to maintain cleanliness round the clock on the station premises.

Later, he took a ride on self-cleaning machine and monitored cleaning work on the platform, said ECR CPRO Rajesh Kumar.

Lauding their efforts, the GM presented commendation certificates to 22 sanitary staff for their sincerity and maintaining cleanliness at Patna Junction. He also distributed cloth bags, soaps, masks and Covid-19 related apparels to passengers at the platform, Rajesh said.

Sources said Patna Junction will also soon have coach indication boards (CIBs) at all platforms. Out of the 10 platforms, the CIB facility is not available on platform numbers 6, 8 and 9 only. Railways has replaced the old coach indication boards with new ones with both side display about arrival and departure of passenger trains, sources said.

Besides, railways has installed large TV screens in the waiting halls, retiring rooms and other public places at Patna Junction to help passengers know about the arrival and departure as well as live positions of trains.

Also, 14 new ATMs are proposed to be installed on Patna Junction premises — eight at the Mahavir Temple side and six at Karbighaiya end. Altogether 144 ATM kiosks are proposed to be installed at different places in the division to fulfil the needs of passengers, sources said.

In addition to it, railways has worked out a plan to provide medical kiosks at Patna Junction, which has about one lakh passengers’ footfall per day during normal days. However, in the Covid-19 pandemic, railways has checked the entry of those who do not have journey tickets.

“The local police stations have been instructed to help the KMC by keeping a check on the persons who have access to the safe homes. Since the patients are staying alone with valuables and people are engaged in several odd jobs on a contract basis, increasing the overall security of these homes is a major target. It is especially true for the bigger facilities, like the one at Gitanjali stadium and the one at Science City,” said a police source.

The KMC has already called for necessary tenders in this regard, said sources.

The overall plan, claimed sources, was to include fire security as well, the audit for which was completed by the fire department.

56,['27/09/2020'],Demand in US leads to 40% jump in lab-grown diamond exports in Aug,"Surat: It seems the coronavirus pandemic has not dimmed the liking of the diamond connoisseurs in Uncle Sam’s land. At a time when the export of polished diamonds from India has dipped phenomenally, the exports of lab-grown polished diamonds has continued its growth trajectory in the range of 22-40% between June and August as compared to the same period the previous year.

Industry sources said about 95% of the lab-grown diamonds manufactured in Surat, the world largest lab-grown polishing centre, are exported to US, considered as the biggest market for the lab-grown diamond jewellery. The reason why the lab-grown gems have become favourite among the US consumer is the fact that they are 60% cheaper than the natural diamonds.

Lab-grown Diamond and Jewellery Promotion Council (LGDJPC) chairman Shashikant Shah told TOI, “Even though the lab-grown diamond export are minuscule compared to the natural diamonds, but they are gaining huge popularity among the US consumers given their cheaper prices compared to natural diamonds.”

According to Shah, the growth of lab-grown diamond exports was in double digits during the Covid-19 pandemic compared to natural diamonds which saw a sharp dip.

“There are over 2,000 small and medium units in Surat manufacturing lab-grown diamonds. After unlock-1, the lab-grown diamond units are working in full capacity due to increased demand. These diamonds are studded in gold and bling jewellery in US,” added Shah.

Export figures provided by the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) show that August recorded the highest export of lab-grown diamonds at Rs 373 crore against Rs 266 crore during the same month in the previous year, registering an increase of 40%.

According to the latest Global Diamond Report-2019 by Bain & Company, most of the lab-grown diamonds are purchased in the US, but produced in China and India. While China accounts for nearly 50% of the lab-grown gems’ global production, India produces 20%.

Diamond industry analyst, Aniruddha Lidbide said, “Many natural diamond manufacturers have shifted to lab-grown manufacturing post-Covid. Reason being that the rough diamond prices have appreciated by 15% in the local market and the demand for natural diamonds has decreased.”

62,['27/09/2020'],"Bihar assembly elections: Ex-DGP Gupteshwar Pandey meets Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, triggers speculations","Ex-DGP Gupteshwar Pandey arrives at JD(U) office in Patna on Saturday

PATNA: Four days after taking voluntary retirement from service (VRS), former Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey called on CM Nitish Kumar at the JD(U) office here on Saturday, triggering speculations about his joining politics to contest the state assembly election.

Pandey, however, said he was yet to take a decision on either joining politics or contesting election.

“I had no political talks (with the CM). I came here (JDU office) to meet CM Nitish and thank him for giving me absolute freedom in performing my duties as the DGP,” Pandey told mediapersons.

When asked whether he would contest from Buxar assembly constituency or Bagaha, Pandey said, “I have yet not taken any decision on contesting polls.”

Though the former DGP is keeping his cards close to the chest, political circles in Bihar are agog with speculations that Pandey, a Brahmin, would contest either assembly polls from any Brahmin-dominated constituency in Bhojpur or Buxar district, or the parliamentary byelection from Valmikinagar seat, which fell vacant after the death of JD(U)’s MP Baidyanath Prasad Mahato.

Sources said Pandey, a native of Buxar, would most probably be the NDA candidate either from Buxar or Brahmapur or Shahpur in the neighbouring Bhojpur district. All these three are Brahmin-dominated assembly constituencies.

“In the 2015 assembly election, the grand alliance had won all these three seats against BJP candidates. If these seats fall in the BJP kitty among the NDA partners, Pandey may be asked to join BJP to contest from either of the seats. This is the reason why Pandey is not disclosing his next move,” a senior NDA leader told TOI on Saturday.

A senior JD(U) leader said the ruling party was also considering Pandey’s name for the parliamentary bypoll from Valmikinagar, but a final decision would be taken by the top NDA leaders as RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha has now expressed his desire to contest that seat after joining the NDA camp.

KOLKATA: The Covid-19 pandemic has redefined business practices, even in the private bus sector . The latest change has been brought about by passengers who have not been taking tickets from conductors to avoid any chance of infection, leading to bus owners losing track of ticket sales. This has led bus owners to get into a contract with the driver-conductors. Now, drivers and conductors bear all costs, including fuel, and give back a contract fee at the end of the day.

“So far, the daily commission for the driver (12%) and conductor (9%) used to be determined by ticket sale. Now, since hardly any ticket exchanges hands, it has become a challenge for us,” said Tapan Banerjee, secretary, Joint Council of Bus Syndicates .

The contract system — ‘baat-chit’ — that the bus owners have entered into with drivers and conductors is prevalent in the metered taxi business. The majority of such cabs are now run, fuelled and maintained by the drivers who pay Rs 300-Rs 400 to the owner.

“In the current situation, there has been a serious drop in passenger count. Running a bus is now a challenge. But if you leave it idle, many mechanical troubles crop up. Moreover, there is a pressure from the government to run buses. Since we cannot pay EMIs, many of us have left our buses with the drivers and conductors. Under the current situation, we cannot specify baat-chit money. Many a days, they cannot give us anything,” Banerjee added.

However, this contract system cannot go on, said sources. “If operators lose control of the business, the entire system will go for a toss. This is why we are thinking of introducing electronic transfer of money from passenger to conductor. But this requires a smartphone and not all users can afford it,” said Rahul Chatterjee of Bus Minibus Samannay Samity.

The issue has also led to the closure of many small printing presses in the suburbs. “Earlier, buses required around 35 lakh tickets every week. Now we have nothing to depend on,” said Gautam Pyne, a letter press owner.

RAJKOT: Once schools reopen after the lockdown , the students of Ditala village primary school in Dhari taluka of Amreli district will have lot of green vegetables in their mid-day meals.

All thanks to Ashwin Patel, the principal of this school, who decided to take to organic farming on the school premises while teaching has been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“I have set up a greenhouse in the school, in which I have grown 10 types of vegetables including brinjals, ladies’ fingers (okra), bottle gourds, spinach, colocasia leaves, fenugreek, garlic , turmeric and carrots,” says Patel.

“These vegetables have been grown through organic farming in which I have used fertilizer made out of cow dung. My idea is to serve these vegetables to my students in their mid-day meals, once the school reopens,” explains Patel.

Shafi Jiruka, a teacher at the school who is helping Patel in his endeavour, says: “Our objective is to provide nutritious food to the schoolchildren. The greenhouse built by us is attracting many farmers who are coming to our school from the nearby villages to understand the concept of organic farming.”

65,['27/09/2020'],Mukhtar Ansari to be brought to Mau for questioning,"VARANASI: Having cracked the whip on the economic empire as well as the armoury of the jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari and his henchmen, police are now in the process of bringing the don to Mau from Rupnagar Jail of Mohali in Punjab on October 21 to interrogate him in a case of fraud and Arms Act lodged against him in January.

Meanwhile, largescale action against Mukhtar’s family members and henchmen continued in different districts of Varanasi zone on Friday and Saturday.

SP Mau Ghule Sushil Chandrabhan said, “Warrant B has been procured by the district police from chief judicial magistrate court in a case of sections 419 (cheating by impersonation), 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 467, 468 (forgery), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC and 30 Arms Act on January 5 registered with Dakshintola police station. The CJM Court accepted the plea of the police to bring him here from Mohali jail on Warrant B. Mukhtar will be brought here on October 21.”

As per records of Mau police, in 2001 four persons — Israel, Anwar and Salim one Mohd Shah Alam — had managed to get arms licences on the recommendation given on Mukhtar’s letter by mentioning fake addresses on their application forms. Alam was eliminated in an encounter with police in Ghazipur after a few years while others are absconding. Apart from them, former station officer Dakshintola police station JK Singh and then lekhpal were also accused in this case by the police.

These facts had come to light during the Ghosi assembly by-poll process in October 2019, when arms licence verification was initiated across Mau district, said police.

During investigation, it came to light that apart from Israel, Anwar and Salim, Mohd Shah Alam had also applied for arms licences in 2001. To ensure that they all get licences for double-barrel guns, Mukhtar wrote letters to the then district magistrate on his letter pad in the capacity of Mau MLA in December 2001 requesting to issue arms licences in their names, police added.

The investigation also exposed the role of then SO Dakshintola JK Singh and a lekhpal, who showed the fake addresses of four applicants as verified and the arms licences were issued on the same fake addresses.

Apart from preparing ground to bring Mukhtar for interrogation, Mau cops have also registered a case against owner of Prakash Construction Company Kiran Rai at Kotwali police station for utilizing fake documents to grab major contracts in order to provide financial benefits to the Mukhtar gang, said SP Mau.

Besides, police also got a non-bailable warrant issued from CJM court against Mukhtar’s wife Afsha Ansari, her brothers Sharjil Raja alias Atif, Anwar Shahjad , henchmen- Zakir alias Vikky and Ravi Narain Singh in a case of land grabbing registered against them at the Dakshintola police station on July 9.

Another case for barring contractors from taking part in tender process of different government departments, issuing threats and extorting money from firms awarded contracts was lodged against Santosh Singh, who was co-accused with Mukhtar in Manna Singh murder case, and four others with Kotwali police station, informed SP Mau.

In Varanasi, SP City Vikas Chandra Tripathi said that the process of confiscating the property of Mukhtar’s close aide Meraj Ansari alias Bhai Meraj was started on Friday by making a public announcement near his residence in Ashok Vihar area.

He is absconding after a case under section 419, 420, 467, 468 and 471 of IPC lodged against him for committing fraud to procure arms licences. Meraj has been absconding since the case was lodged, added Tripathi.

Consequently, people who downloaded the app were able to browse bookshelves in government libraries across Karnataka while seated at home. The app has certainly received an overwhelming response in Belagavi , with 11,000 book lovers downloading it.The department of public libraries launched the application in March but very few users downloaded the app in the weeks immediately after its launch. However, growing awareness and the extended lockdown resulted in patronage for the app increasing, particularly after users learnt that it gave access to books in all public libraries. With 11,000 downloads, Belagavi stands sixth in the state in the number of users for the app: ‘E-Sarvajanika Granthalaya’.Users can access, in addition to a whopping 38,024 books, 5,829 videos, 59,990 ejournals. Moreover, there are more than 5,800 books and other study material for the children. Each public library – there are 10 in the district – in Belagavi has been provided with two computers and four tablets. Visitors to the library can use these devices to read the books they like.Sidram Kurabet, who is keen on writing the Karnataka Administrative Services (KAS) exam, said that he was able to prepare for the key test while at home. “But for the app, I would not have been able to study for the exam with the public libraries being closed,” Kurabet said.Deputy director of the district and central library Ramayya G said that the initiative helped the tech-savvy readers of the present generation. “Even elderly citizens who cannot step out of their homes can read books of their choice on their phones or tablets.

67,['27/09/2020'],"Left flexes muscles, Sahni weighs options outside GA","PATNA: Glitches in the Grand Alliance (GA) over seats continued although RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha on Saturday said the issue will be sorted out in two to three days.

While RLSP has walked out of the alliance blaming RJD, Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) led by Mukesh Sahni is yet to take a final decision. RLSP head Upendra Kushwaha and Sahni had met last week and sources said VIP may also leave the GA soon. Sahni has openly demanded 25 seats from RJD.

Interestingly, RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Friday did not mention VIP or RLSP as his alliance partners and took the names of only Congress and the Left parties. “It is better to give tickets to strong candidates of Nishad community than giving 25 seats to Sahni,” said a senior RJD leader.

Sources said Sahni is in touch with Congress. TOI could not contact Sahni over his phone.

Meanwhile, RJD and Congress were busy in discussing seat-sharing issue over the phone. “Discussion is going on and senior leaders are talking at length. The scene will be more clear in a couple of days,” said a Congress leader, claiming his party will contest around 70 seats.

Sources said after Tejashwi’s talks with state Congress president Madan Mohan Jha recently, senior Congress leader Ahmad Patel is trying to sort out the issue with RJD.

Though Left parties are in regular touch with RJD, CPI(ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya told TOI over phone that they were not happy with the earlier proposal. “There are still issues like the number and choice of seats. Certain areas carry our identity. And then we have to think of winnability also. But there has been some forward motion now,” said Bhattacharya.

When asked about RLSP and VIP, he said, “I do not really know.” But he also said there were mainly three alliance partners — Left, RJD and Congress. And even in Left, he added, CPI(ML) is the strongest in Bihar.

CPM leader Awadhesh Kumar also demanded respectable number of seats for his party. “We should get proper seats, so that our party workers are satisfied. I expect RJD to be positive,” he said.

CPM has even called a meeting on Sunday to discuss various issues with party workers.

68,['27/09/2020'],Why ex-IAS officers fare better than other bureaucrats in polls,"PATNA: Former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey visited the JD(U) office on Saturday, fueling the speculation that he may join the party soon. Pandey, a 1987-batch IPS officer, opted for VRS five months before his retirement from service apparently to plunge into active politics.

Pandey, however, will not be the first bureaucrat from the state to switch from ‘naukarshahi’ to ‘rajniti’. Earlier this month, Pandey's batchmate, Sunil Kumar, who superannuated in August from the post of DG-cum-managing director of Bihar Police Building Construction Corporation, had joined JD(U).

Though the electoral future of the two (retired) IPS officers hangs in balance, their seniors and former DGPs--Dhuv Prasad Ojha and Ashish Ranjan Sinha—had unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary polls from Begusarai and Nalanda in 2004 and 2014, respectively.

While Ojha (1967 batch) opted for VRS after being removed as state DGP weeks before his retirement for his ""tough action"" against don-turned politician Md Shahabuddin, Sinha (1972 batch) served as state police chief both during the Lalu-Rabri era and Nitish’s tenure.

Another IPS officer Ashok Kumar Gupta (1977 batch), contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Patna Sahib parliamentary constituency but had to bite the dust. Balbir Chand (1975 batch) had unsuccessfully contested the 2004 Lok Sabha election from Gaya (reserved) constituency on a BJP ticket.

But luck smiled on two other IPS officers—Lalit Vijay Singh (1956 batch) and N K Singh—who were elected as MPs from Begusarai and Madhepura Lok Sabha constituencies, respectively.

Lalit Vijay Singh later became minister of state for defence in the Chandrashekhar government. N K Singh(1961 batch) had served as joint director of the CBI before switching to politics.

V D Ram (1973-batch), former DGP of Jharkhand, got elected from Palamu in Jharkhand. Rameshwar Oraon (1972 batch) also got elected and is currently holding the post of finance minister in the Hemant Soren government in Jharkhand.

Both V D Ram and Rameshwar Oraon—had served as IPS officers in undivided Bihar.

However, the success rate of IAS officers is higher than that of their IPS counterparts. For instance, R K Singh, a 1975 batch IAS officer is now minister of state for power and new and renewable energy in the Narendra Modi cabinet. Before being elected as BJP MP from Ara in Bhojpur, Singh had served as Union home secretary. He had joined BJP in 2013.

Among the more illustrious names is that of Meira Kumar (1973 batch, IFS), who became India's first woman Lok Sabha Speaker from 2009 to 2014. Daughter of veteran Congress leader Jagjivan Ram, Meira Kumar represented the Sasaram Lok Sabha constituency. She joined politics with a bang in 1985 by defeating rivals Ram Vilas Paswan and Mayawati in the Bijnaur by-election.

Born in Patna, Yashwant Singh (1960 batch) joined politics after quitting the administrative service in 1984. He went on to become the finance minister in the Chandrashekhar cabinet in 1990-91 as a member of Janata Dal, before switching to BJP and serving as finance minister and external affairs minister in the BJP-led NDA government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

In 2018, he quit BJP due to differences over leadership of the party. He has recently formed the United Democratic Alliance to fight the assembly election.

A political analyst and former director of A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies Professor DM Diwakar attributed the higher success rate of ex-IAS officers to people’s perception of the police force.

“People still fear to visit a police station or meet senior police officers. This perception is primarily because of the training of the IPS officers and their behaviour with the people during their service. On the other hand, retired IAS officers easily mingle with people,” he said.

And contactless thermometers or temperature guns that are in vogue in Covid times will turn more accurate.

Saurashtra University’s physics department has bagged a project that aims to increase efficiency of electronic gadgets by 1,000 times.

For this futuristic project, the department will work in collaboration with Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC). The Board of Research in Nuclear Science (BRNS) of Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has provided Rs 27 lakh fund to SU to develop multi device sensors.

SU has bagged the project after basic research which was presented online before 15 top scientists of DAE.

“The ultra-high technology sensors will change the world of gadgets in future. These sensors will change the speed and accuracy of all electronic gadgets. It will increase computer’s speed by 1,000 times while it may enhance mobile technology by 10,000 times,” said Nikesh Shah, professor and project investigator.

Explaining the three-year long project, Shah said that currently higher memory and strong processors are used to increase speed and efficiency of electronic devices.

“By doing this, the device also consumes more electricity and you need to often recharge the devices. Our project is to make electromagnetic particles using very thin - micro 100 nanometer films. Using these multi device sensors can be developed to increase speed of electronic gadgets,” he said, adding that this will also decrease power consumption of the gadgets.

“The thin micro nanometer films will make the sensors faster, increase their efficiency and accuracy and will also eliminate errors that surface in single device sensors,” he said.

The team is trying to develop multi device sensors that can record temperature, voltage, resistance among other parameters.

“We will buy a high resistance meter worth Rs nine lakh from the fund to measure resistance. We will also appoint a research fellow who will get an opportunity to work at BARC’s laboratory for three years,” said co-investigator Piyush Solanki.

The department is also mulling to research the use of such sensors to test virus, bacteria and fungus in laboratories.

But these are the times of Coronavirus, and yet the sight outside party offices at Beer Chand Patel Marg remained unchanged a day after the election dates were announced.

This arterial road in the state capital hosts three major political party offices. Candidates vying for tickets are rushing to any one who they think could help them get a party ticket to contest the coming polls. Many candidates are knocking on the doors of senior party leaders to personally seek help in getting tickets.

The road outside Sadaqat Ashram, the Congress’s state headquarters, was also jam-packed on Saturday with the party’s screening committee chairman Avinash Pandey present at the office. “Since he has been given the responsibility of shortlisting the candidates, a large number of them have come to meet him. Some have even gone to Delhi, as they were not aware Avinash Ji will be here today,” said a party leader.

However, not all were lucky enough to have a meeting with Pandey, who himself said he has personally received 2,500 biodatas at Delhi and nearly 4,000 have been submitted in Patna.

Outside JD (U) office, interested candidates made a beeline on Saturday. One of the main reasons was JD (U) national secretary-general (organisation), RCP Singh being present at the party office. He was meeting interested candidates and party workers. Former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey was also among the visitors. On the day of the announcement of poll dates, many ticket-seekers had rushed to the bungalow where RCP resides in Patna.

When asked about the crowd at JD (U) office, party’s state spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said, “Most of them are the ones who are interested in contesting the election. Everyone wants to fight from the party which has a clean image and all probabilities to win and since we have expanded till the grassroots level, many people are coming from far off places,” said Ranjan.

For those interested in contesting on RJD’s symbol, their priority is to meet party ’chief Lalu Prasad in Ranchi, though a large number of them are returning without getting to meet him. Many of them also wait outside former CM Rabri Devi’s bungalow to interact with Lalu’s younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav.

The party’s state general secretary (headquarters), Nirala Yadav said, “Over 250 candidates had come today to submit their portfolio, and then they rushed to 10 Circular Road.” Sources said many workers were waiting for the younger Yadav scion, as the latter had gone to attend former parliamentarian Raghuvansh Prasad’s Singh ‘shradh’.

The BJP office on Beer Chand Patel Marg also witnessed a huge rush from morning till late in the evening on Saturday. While the campus was jam-packed, even outside the office, there was a huge rush. Party’s state media in-charge Ashok Bhatt, “A large number of party workers and ticket aspirants had come today. State president Sanjay Jaiswal, deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi and health minister Mangal Pandey had also come today at the party office.”

71,['27/09/2020'],Metro eyes more tweaks to get more riders,"Kolkata: More changes are likely in the system as Metro Railway operates its graded run during the pandemic. The likely tweaks include reduced duration of the one-hour e-pass to 45 minutes, which may lead to an increase in the number of booking slots.

When services resumed on September 14, the colour-coded e-passes were made mandatory to access a north-south Metro station. The URL https://pathadisha.com/metro, from where the e-passes are downloaded , has become the most effective tool for crowd management. It puts a 400-passenger cap for every train. Currently, the day’s bookings have been divided into 12 one-hour slots. “The one-hour validity of an e-pass may be reduced and services split into 45-minute slots so more slots can be added to the existing 12,” said Sanjay Chatterjee, whom the state assigned to develop the e-pass technology.

From Monday, Metro will have more trains and timings will be extended by 30 minutes to address the evening-hour rush. But the carrier may have to tweak frequencies and change timings yet again, depending on the data analysis of the last fortnight’s run. On Friday, Metro Railway handed over a compiled station-wise and slot-wise data on passenger count to the developer so the system could be evolved and the issues addressed.

“More changes will be introduced as and when required,” Metro GM Manoj Joshi said on Saturday.

“The increase in slots could be introduced during peak hours. If we could have four slots instead of three, between 5pm to 8pm, there will be more options for passengers. The lean-time slots may remain hour-long,” Chatterjee explained.

Currently, a slot draws at least 4,000 people. “With more available, the count will be multiplied and more can ride the Metro,” Chatterjee said.

In the next few weeks, other changes could be introduced. “Another way of easing congestion is by reducing peak-hour frequency from 10 minutes to 9 minutes, advancing start time by 30 minutes and adding more trains,” said an official.

The checks included the east, southeast and the south suburban divisions.

Four of the six check-points in east division covered the same route that accused Abhishek Kumar Pandey took to flee from cops, including Highland Park, Urbana and 206 bus stand. In the east division alone, 43 persons were arrested for disorderly conduct and 33 were nabbed for flouting Motor Vehicle Act rules — speeding, dangerous driving, riding without helmet, among others. “We found motorists and bikers equally irresponsible,” said an officer.

“We are conducting the raids on roads, hotels and bars to make roads safer and identify the criminal element trying to hide around here,” said DC (east) Gaurav Lal.

These surprise drives will continue at least till the end of the festival season, said a senior officer. There will also be heavy cop presence along the stretch at night.

Surat: The Surat Citizen Council Trust (SCCT), environment lovers and NGOs have started a campaign to increase green cover on the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) campus with native trees.

Being the hub of education in the city, VNSGU has a vast swathe of unused land where the native trees could be grown.

Currently, the VNSGU authorities have created a huge parking space with the paver blocks at the campus for the vehicles of the students and staff. No provision has been kept for tree plantation there.

In the past fortnight, about 70,000 trees were added to the existing tree cover in the city during the campaign started by deputy mayor Nirav Shah.

Snehal Patel of Nature Club Surat (NCS), who planted 2,000 trees across the city during the campaign told TOI, “As part of our commitment to plant 2,000 trees, about 80 trees were planted at Sarvajanik College of Architecture parking area. It is very important that trees are grown in parking spaces.”

Patel added, “We want to plant trees at the VNSGU parking space by convincing the authorities that the plantation will not only add green cover, but help in preserving the biodiversity.”

President of SCCT, Sharad Kapadia told TOI, “The council has taken up the plantation drive issue with the VNSGU authorities for providing space in the parking area. We are pursuing the authorities to sign an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for helping them to achieve greening goal”

Ashok Parikh, environment activist said, “When the concrete parking was under construction at VNSGU, we had approached the authorities requesting them to make small gaps for planting trees. However, the authorities did not pay heed.”

An official of the VNSGU asking anonymity said, “If there is any proposal to plant trees, we are ready for the dialogue with the concerned people.”

Yadav, accompanied by AIMIM state general secretary Aftab Ahmed and its Bihar election incharge Majid Hussain, told the media that both the NDA and the Grand Alliance were trying to divert people’s attention from real issues plaguing the state.

“They are fanning people’s emotions on caste and communal lines and pushing back the issues of unemployment, migration, floods, poor healthcare, plight of farmers and deteriorating law and order situation in the state,” they said.

They further stated that the closed sugar mills, jute factories, paper mills, handicraft manufacturing units and yarn mills showed the state government’s callousness towards creating job opportunities for unemployed youths. “The UDSA will raise these issues during its virtual election rallies,” they added.

They said the UDSA constituents would not give tickets to people having criminal antecedents and facing corruption charges. “The UDSA allies will submit the list of their prospective candidates by September 29,” they revealed.

RAJKOT: Nearly seven decades back , 63-year-old Govind Vikmani’s father had moved to Mumbai in search of employment. Like many Kutchi Gujaratis, the city of dreams proved to be lucky for the Vikmanis too.

Mumbai-born senior Vikmani plunged into construction business while his family flourished in export of commodities. At their native – Kotda Roha village in Kutch’s Nakhatrana taluka – they even purchased 21 acre land.

In the Covid-era, however, this business family has turned to farming. The land that the family had purchased just to grow their personal assets, is now being tilled to grow dragon fruits, dates and citrus fruits.

“The Covid-19 pandemic has affected our export and construction business. If we cultivate crops at our land in an organized way, we can create another source of income,” said Vikmani, who has simultaneously started preparing the marketing and export ground for the agro products in Mumbai.

At a time when economists are painting a gloomy picture, Kutchi native businessmen settled in mega cities like Mumbai and Pune, are seeing new business opportunities in agriculture in Kutch.

“I have to take nearly 35 no objection certificates (NOCs) from the stage when I start construction of a building to the stage when I sell them to customers. In agro business, the government is giving so many benefits – right from procuring seeds, to selling agri products and experimenting with crops,” said Bhuj native Dharmendra Agara, a Pune-based civil engineer engaged in construction business.

Agara, who had also worked in South Africa for 15 years before settling in Pune, has purchased 100 acre land in Chiyasar village of Kutch’s Abdasa taluka where he has started farming.

While half of the land is used to cultivate Israeli and desi dates, the other half is used to cultivate medicinal plants.

“We hire experts in every business. So, why not farming? I take expert advice on soil and seeds I need to use while my chartered accountant gives me estimates on income generation,” he said.

“There are over 75 such businessmen from Mumbai and Pune who have approached us to start agro business and we have started their training,” said Amrut Shah, trustee of Kutch-based Krishi Research Innovation and Development Association (KRIDA), a non-profit group that was founded by few Mumbai-based businessmen before two years.

The group provides training and share knowledge with other businessmen encouraging them to take up farming in their native.

“Profit is at the centre because all of them are businessmen. We provide them all customised concepts. For example, income in dragon fruit is good but it needs heavy investment also,” he said.

“We advise them to cultivate multiple products so that if one product doesn’t succeed, they can make an earning from other products. We also help them to create a platform to market their agro produce,” said Vishal Gada, a consultant.

KRIDA ALSO CREATING MANPOWER

KRIDA is also helping create manpower for businessmen. It trains Kutchis who lost their jobs during lockdown. “We are offering them residential courses in agriculture and also give them salary. They get jobs in farms of these businessmen. After finishing their training, they can re-settle in Kutch if they wish,” said Amrut Shah.

PATNA: A 23-year-old woman was sent to jail on Saturday for allegedly drowning her 4-year-old partially blind minor son in a water body to pave way for her fourth marriage.

The incident took place at Hassanpur Khandah under Shahjahanpur police station area in rural Patna on Friday.

SHO Amrendra Kumar said the woman was identified as Dharmasheela Devi. “Her son Sajan Kumar was partially blind and dumb. He was the child from her first marriage with Arun Chaudhary,” Kumar said, adding Arun belongs to Bhadaul under Hilsa police station area in Nalanda district.

The EC has mandated a maximum of five people for door-to-door campaigning and roadshows with just five vehicles in one convoy among others. Most parties have already taken to digital electioneering to reach out to the nearly 7.8-crore voters in the state.Even though public meets have been allowed with a maximum of 100 people under the Unlock measures, parties said their top leaders and star campaigners will address rallies, which may be partly physical and broadly virtual. Most parties are also emphasizing traditional door- to- door campaigning in the prevailing scenario.Baiju Nath Singh, additional chief electoral officer, Bihar, told TOI on Saturday that district electoral officers-cum-district magistrates have been authorized to identify grounds for allowing such gatherings. “The district electoral officer will allow political gatherings after scrutinizing the applications vis-a-vis the guidelines of the EC as well as the ministry of health,” he said.BJP functionaries said top leaders like PM Narendra Modi and Union minister Amit Shah among others may address rallies with a limited number of people as per EC guidelines. “Though the electioneering schedule of PM Modi and other start campaigners has not been finalized yet, it is most likely to be on ground rallies with restricted participants along with a live telecast and webcast across the state. The party already has a strong IT team at work for ensuring live streaming of such events,” a senior functionary in Bihar BJP said wishing anonymity.BJP’s Patna Sahib MLA Nand Kishor Yadav also echoed similar sentiments about virtual rallies. “A larger part of the electioneering of national-level leaders will be through the virtual medium,” he said.BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand also said all EC guidelines related to Covid-19 will be followed strictly to ensure public safety amid the pandemic. “Though it is premature to say anything concrete in this regard, the party welcomes the EC guidelines regarding electioneering and it will be followed in all our activities,” he said.Similar is the opinion of Congress functionaries regarding poll meets of top leaders such as Rahul Gandhi. “As per a preliminary assessment of the guidelines of EC regarding the political gatherings, we are most likely to connect big leaders through a virtual medium. Permission will be taken from district electoral officer for roadshows and the number of party workers and vehicles will be strict as per EC guidelines. Moreover, our maximum focus will be on door-to-door campaigning,” senior Congress functionary and chairman of Bihar Congress’s manifesto committee Madhab Anand said.Ruling JD (U)’ spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad also claimed that door-to-door campaigning will be more effective this elections. “Door-to-door campaigning has traditionally been the most effective way of interacting with the electorate.

PATNA: The JD(U) and BJP have seemingly agreed to apportion the 243 assembly seats under the broad framework of the 50:50 formula on the pattern of 2019 parliamentary election and then share their respective quota among the partners aligned with either of them within the NDA, sources said.

Accordingly, JD(U) has agreed to contest 122 assembly seats and BJP 121, they added. Although neither of the two has said anything publicly, sources said BJP national president J P Nadda apprised CM Nitish Kumar on the broad formula during his recent visit to Patna .

“Nadda’s polite message to Nitish was that any other seat-sharing formula — like JD(U) getting visibly more seats than BJP — would not send out a good message among the electorate (BJP’s supporters),” a source said.

That way, it would be for the first time that BJP and JD(U) would be contesting almost an equal number of assembly seats in the state — a long cherished demand of the Bihar BJP rank and file since 2007.

Otherwise, JD(U), projecting itself as the ‘elder party’ due to the high stock of Nitish in public esteem, had contested 139 seats and BJP 102 in November 2005, winning 88 and 55 seats respectively. The corresponding figures for JD(U) and BJP during the 2010 assembly elections were 141 and 102, recording their respective wins at 115 and 91 seats.

At present, the four-party Bihar NDA constituents are in two groups — HAM(S) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi as the JD(U) partner and LJP led by Chirag Paswan aligned with BJP.

The probable fifth constituent, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) led by Upendra Kushwaha, former Union minister in PM Narendra Modi government, has yet not been formally readmitted into the NDA. However, the seat-sharing talks between the BJP and RLSP began on Saturday.

As to Manjhi, it is felt that Nitish would give him around six seats, keeping 116 seats for the JD(U) candidates. Alternatively, if Manjhi’s party is given more than six seats to contest, Nitish might field his party’s candidates on the HAM(S) seats.

Nitish on Friday told mediapersons that it was the BJP’s responsibility to handle (rather contain) LJP chief Chirag Paswan. Similarly, he added that BJP ought to also juggle with the seat-related demands of Kushwaha.

Ironically, Nitish’s advice to BJP was also that handling the demands of the LJP and RLSP was its responsibility, because they had entered the NDA in 2014 (when he himself was not part of the alliance till July 2017).

His cautionary note with regard to RLSP was — BJP should also look at the parties which quit the NDA on the eve of the 2019 parliamentary elections.

BHAGALPUR: While the district administration is busy with the preparations for assembly election, a section of residents seems to be apathetic towards polls in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic and financial instability due to prolonged lockdown and restrictions since March.

“Lockdown and restrictions due to Covid-19 pandemic have caused financial burden to us and our families,” said Anil Mandal.

Echoing similar views, Pramod Kumar said he doesn’t care who wins or loses in assembly election. “No politician actually cares about us,” said Birendra Kumar, an employee of a private firm.

There are seven assembly segments in the district — Bihpur, Gopalpur , Pirpainty, Kahalgaon, Bhagalpur , Sultanganj and Nathnagar.

Some political outfits expect low voter turnout owing to Covid threat, others consider it as a challenge to ensure large turnout for their gain.

Bhagalpur SSP Ashish Bharti said all required measures are being taken for peaceful polling in the district. “Steps like initiating Bihar Crime Control Act (CCA) against criminals and antisocial elements have been taken. The SHOs have been alerted to nab criminals and check crime under their respective jurisdictions,” he said.

Bhagalpur DM Pranav Kumar also said every effort is being made to ensure free and fair polls.

86,['27/09/2020'],"Distribution of vaccine is next challenge, govt needs Rs 80,000 crore to immunize country, says Serum CEO","Mumbai: The government may need Rs 80,000 crore over the next one year for distribution and immunization of Covid-19 vaccine to India’s entire population, Adar Poonawalla, CEO and promoter of the world’s largest vaccine producer, Serum Institute, said on Saturday.

Calling it the “next concerning challenge” which needs to be tackled, Poonawalla posted a tweet tagging the Prime Minister’s Office, which read, “We need to plan and guide vaccine manufacturers both in India and overseas to service the needs of our country in terms of procurement and distribution”.

Serum has tie-ups with global manufacturers AstraZeneca and Novavax for potential Covid-19 vaccines which are undergoing clinical trials. The tweetraised concerns of the government’s ability to fund the massive vaccine programme.

Poonawalla told TOI, “The government has assured that there will be plenty of funds available for vaccine procurement, supply and logistics. This is good news.”

Meanwhile, while addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Prime Minister Narender Modi said reportedly on Saturday that as the largest vaccine-producing country of the world, India’s production and delivery capacity will be used to help people across the world.

Though further details were not available on modality of the calculation, sources say it could be assuming the benchmark price of $3-5 per dose, including two doses for the over 1.3 billion population. Also, distribution, procurement and logistics cost have been built in. Earlier, Serum had announced a ceiling price of $3 per dose for the proposed Covid-19 vaccines for India and low-and middle-income countries.

Analysts expect the vaccine market in India to be around $6 billion, spread over three years. Bernstein Research expects the government to spend $2 bn and pick up the tab for 50% of the population, while the remainder will access the vaccine from the private market. “We estimate volumes to be split 55:45 between the government channel and private market, and procurement prices to be $3 per dose for the government, and end consumer prices of $6 in the private market,” it said in a recent note.

87,['27/09/2020'],"Four days before exams, students complain of glitches in NU app","Representative image

NAGPUR: Four days before Nagpur University (NU)’s inordinately-delayed final year examination commences, its ‘Pariksha App’ has received a slew of complaints from the students. Right from facing problems in downloading it to a series of blunders in mock test questions, the new app is proving to be a big headache for aggrieved examinees, who have been waiting for their papers since the last four months.

After its much hyped launching by vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari on Wednesday, the app is yet to be uploaded on Google Playstore . NU somehow managed to upload it on its website and told students to download from it. However, the experimentation didn't seem to be successful, as many of them were unable to download it.

Rejecting the students’ claims, Board of Examination and Evaluation ( BOEE ) director Prafulla Sable told TOI that students weren’t reading instructions before downloading the app and therefore, it wasn’t getting installed. “Many lecturers called us, complaining about the same. When I explained the procedure to them, they successfully installed it,” Sable said.

He added that the students could open the NU website on all browsers except Google Chrome, which blocks it for security reasons. “The software will not be downloaded even if there is a minute error. So reading instructions is a must before proceeding,” Sable explained.

Admitting mistakes in mock test questions, Sable said they were not filled properly in the software and therefore, some portion was automatically deleted while entering. “We’ve removed all such questions now and replaced them with correct ones. Even for us, this system is entirely new. It’s the first time we’re experimenting with online mode and it’s obvious that errors would emerge. But we’re rectifying them quickly and there’s no need to panic.”

The students, however, aren’t convinced with NU’s explanation. Since exams were just four days away, they said, they would be at a loss if such technical glitches continued to haunt them.

“The standard of mock tests is not up to the mark. Being a student of law, I would expect questions from my stream. However, there isn't any option for stream available,” Aradhya Pande , a student of Ambedkar College of Law, said.

Agreeing with her, mass communication student Shrutika Zade said using the app would be big problem for examinees from rural areas, due to network issues and snags. “It’s unavailable on playstore. There is a lot of fear and anxiety on what will happen during the papers.”

Sable, however, added that the app required some permission, which delayed its uploading. “Google has now cleared it and it’s likely to be uploaded on its playstore by Sunday,” he said.

The four youngsters obtained permission from the forest department to undertake the trek, and were instructed to return before 4pm. However, when the youngsters did not return even after dusk, the foresters grew worried.

Parents, relatives and friends of the four youngsters are all worried since they have not been able to contact them on their respective phones. Foresters suspect that they may have lost their way in the woods.

Trekking activity is allowed in Kottigehara and Balur as long as enthusiasts obtain permission from the forest department. Since the Ballalarayana Durga is a thickly wooded area, the trekkers were informed about the dangers and told to return before night set in.

Balur Reserve Forest division range forest officer Yaseen said, “They must have gotten confused about the route. If they are stuck somewhere deep inside the jungle, they will have to wait till the morning, Baluru police are helping us locate them.”

Jaikant is currently in jail for conspiring the Bikru ambush with gangster Vikas Dubey, while his aide Rahul of Chakarpur Mandi area , is however, currently on the run.

The development comes after he allegedly skipped summons for questioning by the city police. To recall, an FIR in this regard has been lodged at Kakadeo police station under various sections against Jaikant and his aide Rahul on July 22. It might be noted that the police, soon after the Bikru incident, had seized three luxury vehicles, which did not have registration number plates on them, in Kakadeo area of the city.

Investigation later revealed that the vehicles, including an Audi car and a Fortuner, were purchased by a local businessman Jaikant but registered under different names. The seized Fortuner vehicle, registered in the name of Jaikant’s aide Rahul, had a fake sceretariat pass with MLA written on it.

Police had informed that during investigation, it came to fore that pass was fake and procured using computer software and the same was pasted on the windscreen of the Fortuner vehicle. “A warrant has been issued against Rahul and searches are underway. If he continues to evade arrest, we would attach his property,” said SP (West) Dr Anil Kumar.

Gorakhpur: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath paid rich tributes to BJP MLA Janmejay Singh and asked BJP workers to start a door to door campaign to win the Deoria Sadar seat which has fallen vacant due to his untimely demise.

CM Yogi targeted the Opposition while addressing party workers in Deoria on Saturday and said, “Those who don’t know whether sugarcane grows on land or on trees are pretending to fight for farmers and labourers. These very people exploited farmers during their rule and mocked migrant workers in distress during lockdown by giving numbers of scooters and motorcycles in their list while claiming to arrange buses.”

CM Yogi said all the Opposition parties are confusing people on farm bills.

“The Opposition does not want that the farmer can sell their produce to anyone who offers the best price. Since last three years, the payment of crops is directly reaching the bank accounts of the farmers and the Opposition parties fear that their politics will end if the role of mediators ends,” the CM added. “The entire world is appreciating our management during Covid-19 crisis. We not only provided employment to 40 lakh migrant workers, but have been providing them free food when they lost their livelihood,” he said.

“We are dedicated to development and in this byelection, people have to think about who will bring development and provide employment,” the CM added. Yogi appealed to booth level party workers to run a door to door campaign and inform people about the achievements and schemes of the BJP governments at Centre and in state.Enumerating the achievements, he said, “We have been working for development and also established a medical college in Deoria in the name of Devraha Baba. From next year, classes will start for 100 students and people will get high quality medical facilities.”

The number deaths due to encephalitis has reduced substantially due to the state government’s focus on drainage, potable water and cleanliness, the CM said.

Deoria Sadar assembly seat fell vacant after the demise of BJP MLA Janmejay Singh. BSP has already declared Abhainath Tripathi as party candidate from the seat.

BHOPAL: In the absence of the oxygen supply for the past 20 days, thousands of industries in Mandideep and Govindpura — among other industrial areas of the state — are literally gasping for breath. For the whole of Saturday, representatives of industrial areas have been meeting the bureaucrats for restoration of oxygen.

All the oxygen has been diverted for corona patients and industrial use of the oxygen is banned. Already struggling slowdown, many industries have shut down and production may stop in many others.

One week after the government order to restore 10% of the oxygen supply to industries was not implemented, the office-bearers of Govindpura Industrial Area (GIA ) staged a dharna in Bhopal on September 23. The police slapped criminal cases on the industrialists.

Rajeev Agrawal, president of the Association of all Industries of Mandideep, said: “When the industries were limping back to normalcy after the lockdown, the oxygen shortage has paralysed us.”

“Industries all across the state have been hit very badly,” he said after a meeting with the district collector of Raisen and managing director MP Audhovikas Nigam on Saturday. In fact, officer-bearers of the industrial areas in every district of the state have been meeting the collectors of the respective districts for restoration of oxygen supply.

The GIA representatives met district collector of Bhopal on Saturday, but it did not yield any result. The industrialists are now planning to meet the chief minister.

But little do these couples know that their privacy is getting compromised and they can become victims of cybercrime by participating in this new trend.

Chhota Udepur and Kutch police have warned people from posting their photos on social media as there are possibilities that the photos can be misused by morphing images. In a warning on Twitter, superintendent of police, Chhota Udepur has warned people that incidents of cybercrime take place by morphing images that are shared under campaigns like ‘couple challenge’.

“Do not share your personal photos by getting influenced by such challenges on Facebook. If you will use social media without knowing the rules and norms of cyber security, you will become a victim of cybercrime,” the post on Twitter stated.

Kutch police also issued a similar warning. “By uploading your family pictures for such challenges, you are inviting cybercrime,” the warning read. It further said, “Cyber criminals may misuse your personal pictures and such offences have been registered in past too.” Besides ‘couple challenge’, Kutch police asked people also not to get influenced by ‘single challenge’ and ‘cute daughter challenge’.

“Any post with mention of a hash tag becomes a part of public domain. Hashtag is a community so when a user posts photo under a hashtag, the images become a part of public domain,” said Vadodara-based cyber expert Mayur Bhusavalkar.

PANAJI: While some relief from vigorous rainfall activity appears to be in sight after a couple of days, India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji, has forecast heavy precipitation for two more days in isolated places.

With hardly three days for the season’s end, the withdrawal of the monsoon should not be too far away. But the thick rain clouds are not showing signs of clearing up even as an extremely wet September has already logged 710.4mm of rain; 130% more than normal.

The month is likely to record a higher surplus than June, July and August for this season.

“This (710.4mm of rain) is approximately 2.3 times the normal rainfall of September, or 130% higher than normal,” an IMD scientist said.

An average rainfall of 305.8mm is considered normal during this concluding month. But this year has seen progressively increasing precipitation, recording 2.3 times more than the average.

The first fortnight yielded only about 215mm, but the deluge started in the second half, as IMD, Panaji, recorded nearly 500mm in the season’s last phase.

A trough from east Bihar to west-central Bay of Bengal off the Andhra Pradesh coast, and another one from south Chhattisgarh to south interior Karnataka across Telangana are likely to affect the weather pattern over Goa.

“These systems keep winds over Goa as westerly up to a height of around 5km, resulting in overcast conditions and rain,” an IMD bulletin stated.

He said the authorities would help them in acquiring the equipment at lower prices from the market so that they could monitor their health parameters daily or else they should be shifted to hospital with L-1 facilities.

The commissioner while visiting Kidwai Nagar and the Railway colony was informed by the officials of the health department that some patients (mainly from low income groups) were still found staying in home isolation without oximeters and thermometers due to which their daily health record status monitoring has become difficult.

During the random inspection of urban primary health center in Kidwai Nagar, he sought information about the health care of Covid-19 patients and directed the health workers to collect details, including Aadhar number, mobile number and full address of the patients who had been tested positive there. “If anyone is found positive, then either allocate him the Covid facility or send him/her in home isolation. Apart from this, collect information about people who came in his contact so that contact tracing can be done. Mobile numbers must be cross-checked on the spot by a missed call”, the commissioner said.

He asked the authorities to increase the staff engaged in registration and sample collection work at UPHC Kidwai Nagar . He himself contacted the persons who were there for testing and asked them about the facilities being provided to them. He also inspected the data feeding format and issued necessary directions to them.

He stated that since the role of doctors and RRT teams is quite important in controlling Covid-19, therefore they should ensure proper care of patients. The thereafter visited H-2 Block Kidwai Nagar and the Railway colony and visited the houses of corona positive persons and held one-to-one conversation. He also inquired about the performance of the RRT teams.

Raj Shekhar said that around 40 Rapid Response Teams were active in the field and average positive cases in the last few days were around 300 per day. Earlier, this average was around 450.” We further need to reduce it to minimum by launching a massive awareness campaign. He pointed out that contact tracing and testing were also very important to prevent the spread of Covid-19”. As of now, contact tracing rate is average that is seven contacts per positive case. It would be increased to 10 in the next week, he added.

Sources said this is the third big case related to illicit liquor smuggling and manufacturing of spurious liquor in one month. On Saturday, a case was registered against two accused identified as Pradeep Mittal of Ambala City, a liquor contractor and Jaipal Singh, owner of the marriage palace.

They have been booked under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Excise Act at Panjokhra police station on Saturday, September 26.

Police said Pradeep is a known liquor contractor of Ambala who has several contracts in the district. He is already behind bars for smuggling illicit liquor in the guise of aloe-vera juice to Gujarat. The case was registered at Panjokhra police station on September 12.

In his complaint, Panjokhra police station house officer (SHO) sub-inspector (SI) Mohan Lal stated, “In connection with the investigation of case 123/2020, I along with my team was present at a godown in Mandour village. We received a tip-off that a tin godown is established in Joy Park marriage palace in Barnala village behind the liquor store at Mandour Chowk on Barnala road. It was informed that illicit liquor for sale in Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh is stored in this godown, from where it is supplied to customers.”

He said the owner of Joy Park palace, Jaipal Singh of Sector 7, Ambala City had given his property/godown to liquor contractor Pradeep Mittal to store illicit liquor and supply it. This liquor is kept in the warehouse without license or permit on the basis of fake papers in collusion with his associates, he said.

Ambala deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Madan Lal said, “A total of 1,065 boxes (1,018 boxes Nips 180 ml and 47 boxes of Quarts 750 ml) of country liquor brand “Crazy Romeo” and about 185 to 190 boxes (including Nips and Quarts) of about 10 brands were recovered from the godown on Saturday. A case has been registered and further investigation is on. Pradeep is already in custody. Jaipal claimed that he had given the property to him on lease.”

On September 12, a case was registered at Panjokhra, after a huge quantity of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) was recovered from two godowns at Mandour village of Ambala district. Ambala police formed a special investigation team (SIT) under the leadership of DSP Madan Lal. So far, nine accused, including Pradeep and one Shankar Bhai More of Vadodara, Gujarat have been arrested in the case.

On September 11, Yamunanagar police recovered 689 boxes of illicit country liquor from a truck near Radaur town. A case was registered and an SIT was formed by Yamunanagar police headed by DSP Radaur, Randhir Singh.

Investigations revealed that illicit liquor was being prepared by three persons in a godown at Shahpur-Machhonda village of Ambala district.

DSP Randhir said, “So far, we have arrested two accused in this case, including Pradeep Kumar of Mathana village of Kurukshetra district on September 11 and Bittu Singh of Elahawas village of Bijnor district of Uttar Pradesh on September 14. Names of about six persons, including Rohit Sharma of Ambala, who are involved in preparing illicit liquor at a godown in Shahpur-Machhonda village of Ambala came up. Pradeep used to supply the liquor to various places in the region. Other accused are at large and we are investigating the case.”

Sources said, “Bittu told the police that Rohit owns the godown and he, along with Pradeep and Rohit planned to prepare the illicit liquor and start a business there. Pradeep supplied liquor in his car. Pradeep told the police that they bought extra neutral alcohol (ENA) from a Bahadurgarh based man and started preparing illicit liquor in Ambala.”

99,['27/09/2020'],"Delhi: No site fixed yet, corporations don’t know what to do with all inert soil","At Ghazipur landfill as at Delhi’s Ghazipur landfill site, waste is being recycled to level the trash mountain

NEW DELHI: With biomining picking pace and 33 trommel machines sieving out more than 7,500 tonnes of legacy waste every day, the future of Delhi’s landfill levelling project hinges on the allocation of space for disposing of the inert soil material produced in the process. At the three landfills, there are dark mounds of this end product of biomining, part of which is being used for the development of an eco-park at the site of the former Badarpur thermal power plant. However, managing the entire product of the flattening process is a burdensome prospect.

An East Delhi Municipal Corporation official said the inert soil should be dumped at the abandoned Asola Bhatti Mines or National Highways Authority of India should start using it for base filling in road projects. “The 1.5 lakh tonnes of garbage processed has produced over 75,000 tonnes of inert material,” the official said. “There is no question of Badarpur handling all this. The mines or NHAI proposals should be cleared for the landfill clearance to be completed in the expected time frame.”

A Ridge Management Board meeting, scheduled for September 18, was to have decided whether to allow dumping of inert material at the Asola Bhatti mines. But the meeting was postponed indefinitely after two members said RMB needed to be reconstituted since its tenure had ended. This only delays the process of deciding what to do with the material being generated at the landfills each day. “A meeting can take place only after the board is formally re-constituted. A file on the matter has been sent to Delhi government, and a meeting will be announced once the procedures are completed,” disclosed a forest official.

Last year, the corporations approached NGT for permission to dump inert material into the mine pits numbered 2, 6, 10 and 12. A similar application had been made to Delhi High Court in 2013. NGT, however, refused to accept the application, asking the civic bodies to approach “more appropriate authorities”. With the requested areas falling in the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary , part of the Southern Ridge, RMB’s has to give the permission, officials said.

An EDMC official claimed that tests showed the inert soil to be high in carbon and nitrogen components, suitable for use as enriched soil for farming. For SDMC, disposal has been a bigger problem, according to an official, though the south body had dispatched over 40,000 tonnes to the Badarpur eco-park and Jaitpur’s low-lying areas. The space crunch is a big factor in the slow pace of biomining at Okhla landfill , the official said.

The corporations propose to fill the four abandoned pits in Asola Bhatti, with a cumulative area of 477 acres and average depth of 30 metres, with the inert soil. “The total volume of these pits is 578 lakh cubic-metres, big enough to accommodate all inert material from the three landfills,” a municipal report says. An official assured that for added protection, geo-textile linings would be used before the processed soil is dumped.

100,['27/09/2020'],"No sales, sellers of old books bank on sanitisers, masks to lure buyers","PRAYAGRAJ: As schools and colleges remain shut and classes shift online, sellers of used or second-hand books near Allahabad University (AU) are struggling to stay open for business as the Covid-19 pandemic keeps their regular buyers away.

Even the regular crowd of candidates preparing for various competitive exams in the city is nowhere to be seen near these shops ever since coaching centres were closed to check the spread of the virus.

Desperate for sales to pick up, a few booksellers have also started to stock up on masks and sanitisers to attract customers.

Every year in July as AU and other colleges open for the new session , there is a huge demand for used books. These second-hand book sellers come to the rescue of several students who are not able to afford new books. These shops are also the place to go to if you are looking for out of print books. These old books are more in demand by students preparing for medical, engineering, law, civil service and other competitive examinations. Most of these stores are located on the roadside, outside the AU campus and other colleges.

Even as October just around the corner, the sale of old books is merely 15 to 20% of regular levels, nosediving by around 80%.

A shopkeeper from Katra, Vivek Gupta, said, “A large number of students have gone back to their hometowns as schools, colleges and coaching centres are closed due to the pandemic. No one is asking for books, be it old or new. Online education has also affected the sale of old books.”

Research scholar Ajay Tiwari said, “The importance of old books has not diminished despite the availability of online resources. These shops sell several titles which are no longer printed by publishers. These second hand books are useful to several aspirants, who come to Prayagaraj with the dream of cracking competitive exams and are living under stringent budgets.”

Business in stationery shops isn’t any better, which have seen their sales dip by almost 70%.

“We had placed an order for new books in December last year, expecting a jump in sales in April and again in June-July. However, we are unable to retrieve our costs, let alone earn profits,” said Mukesh, a shopkeeper in Dhoomanganj.

101,['27/09/2020'],10-year wait for Delhi to clear its garbage piles?,"NEW DELHI: Indore took three years to level its landfill through trommeling and bio-mining. Delhi may need a decade to achieve similar success. It uses the same model and has made substantial progress since it began a year ago, but it has to process almost 20 times more legacy waste at its three dumps, which, to add to the struggle, still get fresh garbage every day.Taking cognisance of TOI’s report on groundwater contamination at the landfills, National Green Tribunal had ordered the clearing up of the mounds after biomining. The three municipal corporations claimed to have so far cleared 11 lakh tonnes of legacy waste at the Okhla , Bhalswa and Ghazipur landfills, just a fraction of the 280 lakh tonnes estimated to have accumulated over decades. Cumulatively, 33 trommel machines have been installed, with North Delhi Municipal Corporation deploying 15, EDMC 12 and SDMC, six. The lack of space available for the installation of the machines and for dumping the inert material generated by biomining slowed down the process as did the Covid lockdown. There should have been 60 trommels in operation by now.Asad Warsi, waste management expert appointed by NGT, who also worked on the Indore landfill, told TOI that Covid had impacted the exercise and actual work had been limited to around six months. He added that more trommel machines were needed, particularly in Ghazipur and Okhla, both of which have not processed enough waste. “Bhalswa has seen the most progress and is closing in on the target, but Ghazipur might take the longest to achieve,” said Warsi. “The target was to put up 20 trommel machines after a year at each site and 20 to be added every year afterward to flatten the mounds.”While the initial targets were to level the three sites in 4-5 years, Bhalswa, Warsi estimated, could take 5-6 years, Okhla 10 years and Ghazipur up to 15 years, based on the number of trommel machines deployed and progress made so far. “Significant progress has to be achieved because there’s fresh waste arriving every day. The Indore landfill received no fresh garbage,” he noted.Indore’s municipality used 26 trommel machines, processing 2 lakh tonne of waste in the first two years and the remaining 13 lakh tonnes in the third year, the exponential increase in the third year being the result of more trommels being deployed.An EDMC official overseeing the project noted, “The landfill at Indore was around 10 times smaller than even Ghazipur and there was enough space there to dispose of the processed material. We are fighting for space for the inert material at Bhatti Mines, but haven’t been successful. Delhi’s administration lies with a multiplicity of agencies, so the problem of allocating space lingers on.”While the EDMC official maintained that it would take around five years to level the Ghazipur mound — considered to be as tall as the Qutub Minar — experts aren’t so optimistic, putting the completion period at 15 years.The north corporation, the co-ordinating nodal body for tenders for all three civic bodies, is far ahead of the others. It claims to have cleared 7.8 lakh tonnes, clearing up to 4,500 tonnes a day. “With 17 machines operating soon, we can process 10 lakh tonnes within the targeted time,” said an official. “Bhalswa landfill has almost 80 lakh tonnes of legacy waste, and by adding more trommels, we estimate it will take us two years to remove the entire mass.” Warsi, however, opined that it could take around six more years if more machines are put to work.Since all three landfill sites are currently “live sites”, a lot of the progress is being undone. Bhalswa gets 66,000 tonnes of fresh waste every month, so it’s two steps forward, one step back every month. At Ghazipur 2,400 tonnes are removed every day, but 2,000 tonnes are added. Okhla lags by a long distance, with just 900 tonnes being processed daily against around 2,000 tonnes dumped each day. The only short-term solution to avoid fresh garbage is to operationalise new waste-to-energy plants or sent the trash to the new engineered landfill being set up in Tehkhand, an official said.Chitra Mukherjee, head of advocacy and policy at Chintan, an NGO involved with waste-management, argued however that until segregation at source was implemented, the landfills would continue to be burdened. “While you make progress on the ground, you also have to find solutions to prevent fresh waste from arriving at the landfills,” said Mukherjee.If the projects are successful, not only will Delhi be rid of toxic waste mountains, but will also get precious public land. It is expected that 70 acres of land in Ghazipur, 36 acres in Bhalswa and 46 acres at Okhla will be freed up. “The reclaimed land can turn into biodiversity parks or sites for waste-processing plants,” NGT had suggested.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78342387,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-199096,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/10-year-wait-for-capital-to-clear-its-garbage-piles/articleshow/78340326.cms

However, officials couldn’t complete the exercise on Saturday due to vehement protests by civil activists and local residents.

The team arrived at the spot on Saturday noon to demolish houses and heavy police were deployed for the drive.

SP (city) Dinesh Kumar Singh said, “The houses were constructed illegally by close associates of the former MP. The families neither had any ownership records nor any sanctioned maps to show the joint team They had also sold the properties to other people.”

The demolition drive couldn’t be completed due to the protests and police had to forcibly take away around two dozen activists including Samajwadi Party leader Richa Singh. She was among activists who had gathered under the banner ‘ Prayagraj Ghar Bachao Morcha’ to protest against the demolition.

Police initially tried to pacify them by telling them that the houses were constructed illegally on government-owned land. However, when they refused to listen, police forcibly took them away from the area.

“We have appealed to the PDA to regularise the houses and give families adequate time to vacate the premises. We are not supporting any group or person, but demanding that PDA to give ample time to the families to get the maps sanctioned from the authority,” said Richa Singh.

PDA official Alok Pandey said, “Some persons were constructing illegal structures on state land. We have identified the houses which were constructed on government-owned land without getting a map sanctioned by PDA.”

He also said that the exercise would be completed by Sunday. The team vacated the household items from the houses.

The joint team also spotted two other plots where illegal construction was being done. A large crowd had gathered at the spot as the officials tried to reason with the protesters and go ahead with the demolition.

PRAYAGRAJ: Seeking to introduce the world to Kaushambi district ’s rich cultural legacy, the tourism department has decided to submit a proposal to the government to develop various tourism sites associated with Buddhism under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme and connect it with the Buddhist Circuit .

The department would soon submit a Rs 50 crore proposal to the state government. The proposal is based on an elaborate survey conducted by different departments like forest, power, revenue and tourism of several sites of religious and historical importance on Wednesday.

Deputy director (UP Tourism) Dinesh Singh said the ambitious project is proposed to be developed under the Buddhist Circuit, which was created as part of the Swadesh Darshan Scheme.

The Buddhist Circuit is a route that follows the footsteps of Gautam Buddha from Lumbini in Nepal where he was born, through Bihar (Gaya) where he attained enlightenment, to Sarnath where he gave his first sermon and Kushinagar where he died. He visited Kaushambi many times to preach his sermons.

The proposal explains how various sites in Kaushambi can be preserved and developed to boost the district’s tourism potential.

“If the proposal is approved, we plan on adding several attractions for tourists including a majestic meditation centre. Visitors would be treated to an audio-visual show about the importance of the various Buddhist sites in Kaushambi,” said architect of the project Vishal Gulati.

Public amenities like toilets, restaurants, waiting halls, handicraft markets and shops are also be offered to visitors. Other attractions included in the proposal are an open air theatre, water points, ATM kiosks and currency exchange centres for the convenience of foreign tourists. “As there is not enough parking space at most tourists attractions, the department has proposed to launch its own e-rickshaw service which would ferry tourists to the meditation centre,” said Singh.

Sources have claimed that negligence by the officers was responsible for the situation while the plant’s chief engineer was planning to get analysis of the turbine done.

Sources within the power plant said about 4-5 days ago, the turbine had started making noises at night and when the officer present on the spot called the officer concerned, the latter failed to come to the site. Due to this, when the turbine remained functional throughout night, it started giving trouble in the morning. Later the unit was shut down as per the demand-made schedule, sources added.

In the evening it was found that the turbine had broken down and the unit has not been made functional till the filing of this report. Due to this, power generation capacity of various power plants of the state has come down from 4,642MW to 4,042MW. Sources said now the officials were passing the blame on each other.

Turbine executive engineer Pawan Kumar denied that the turbine had broken down while Praveen Girdhar, executive engineer of control and instrumentation, disconnected the phone.

Chief engineer of Khedar power plant Mohammad Iqbal said the turbine had not broken down and the problem was being analyzed. He, however, said one unit was closed at this time.

On the question of recovery of the turbine, he said the problem had not been detected yet. On the question of someone’s negligence, he said that no such thing has come to the fore as of now. Along with this, it said overhauling of the unit was to be done in February, which could happen, resulting in such a situation.

Meanwhile, sources have claimed that due to the non-functional turbine, the plant will incur losses in crores and it might take several months to repair the same.

108,['27/09/2020'],IGI Airport's Terminal-2 to resume operations from October 1,"Pre-Covid, IGI used to handle a flight-a-minute with almost 1,500 daily aircraft movement

NEW DELHI: With air travel gradually reviving, IGI Airport’s Terminal-2 will again become operational from October 1 to accommodate more domestic flights. Since the March-end lockdown, T3 is the only terminal being used at IGIA for all flights. Now with the domestic wing of T3 operating at capacity, Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) has decided to add flights from the next door T2. While reactivating T1 will require a much larger growth in traffic, its not-in-use status gives the airport operator a free hand for the ongoing expansion work there.

IndiGo will be operating some of its domestic flights from T2 beginning next month. The airline website says: “Flight numbers 6E 2000- 6E 2999 will operate from Terminal 2, Delhi, starting October 1, 2020. Please ensure you check your flight number and terminal before leaving for the airport.”

GoAir, meanwhile, said in a tweet: “Effective October 1, 2020, all domestic flights to and from Delhi will arrive and depart from Terminal 2. Please ensure you check your terminal information prior to travel.” Comments from DIAL were sought on which all flights will operate from Terminal 2 from next month and awaited till the time of going to press.

In pre-pandemic days, IGIA saw international flights operate from T3 while all the three terminals — T1, 2 & 3 — handled domestic flights of different airlines. In March-end, scheduled flights were suspended and only Terminal 3 was kept operational. While international schedule flights remain suspended, foreign travel is happening under Vande Bharat Mission and the air bubble arrangement India has worked out with several countries like the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany and France.

This May-end, scheduled domestic flights were allowed to resume and at IGIA those were being handled at the domestic wing of T3. “Domestic air traffic has been growing every month since resumption of operations in May-end. Currently about half of the originally approved domestic summer schedule is operational. T3 domestic side was getting full and reactivating T2 to accommodate more flights was required,” said an airline official.

In pre-Covid times, IGIA used to handle more than a flight-a-minute with almost 1,500 daily aircraft movement. In the pandemic times, the number fell to a handful of cargo and international repatriation flights daily. Once regular domestic flights were allowed in May-end, the number kept rising. Currently, the airport handles over 300 arrivals and as many departures daily apart from about 50 defence, VIP and charter aircraft.

“Since last week, Indira Gandhi International Airport is seeing 650 daily flights, of which about 75 are international operating under Vande Bharat Mission,” said a senior ATC official. From next month, there may be an increase in international flights operating under air bubbles too.

It is for this reason that the School of Planning and Architecture has developed a phone application for the 500 registered havelis in Shahjahanabad . The app not only has data and information on the havelis, but also instructions on conservation and repairs for the haveli owners.The app, called wEconserve, was created by SPA under the Union HRD ministry-supported Design Innovation Centre. Using artificial intelligence and feature recognition systems, it helps in determining the conditions of the heritage buildings and any defects it may, all this requiring no specialised equipment, just a smartphone. The app also has a wider scope related to conservation and restoration of heritage structures in India, and the one on the historic quarters of old Delhi will become the prototype.The smartphone app focuses on providing safety in habitability and convenient and economical conservation solutions in architectural heritage areas. “We are trying to identify the problems that the havelis of Shahjahanabad face,” said Bharti Sikri, research associate with the app project. “Our initial concern was that many people did not have proper information about the havelis. Even owners are unaware of the rich legacy of the buildings. What the app does is shows you if a particular structure is listed as a heritage resid-ence and what level of engineering interventions can be undertaken by the owners.”Sikri added that the tool also informed other haveli owners about the existence and location of historically significant buildings like theirs. “We have located and identified havelis in each mohalla, katra and kucha of old Delhi. People can use the app and their phone cameras to check for defects in their havelis and list things that need looking at, like vegetation growth on the structures or water leakage or cracks,” Sikri elaborated.The research associate pointed out that the app provided first information on haveli owners can get repair works carried out on the registered properties so as not to ruin the heritage character of the buildings. wEconserve acts as a platform to bring residential owners in contact with local government bodies, conservation professionals, artisans involved in restoration and heritage material markets. The app also has information of innovative materials and specifications for simplified, economical and efficient conservation methods.Anuradha Chaturvedi, the project lead, disclosed that haveli owners were consulted and their inputs incorporated into the development of wEconserve. “This is the first of its kind software meant to help protect the havelis of old Delhi,” she said. “We hope that it will be recognised by the civic authorities as an important and necessary tool.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78344807,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-206917,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/historys-app-eal-revive-your-haveli-with-your-fingertips/articleshow/78340338.cms
111,['27/09/2020'],Delhi: Court rejects pre-arrest bail plea of woman in cop’s death case,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: A woman from northeast Delhi’s Chand Bagh faces imminent arrest for her alleged role in the communal violence that took place earlier this year in the capital, after a court on Saturday dismissed her anticipatory bail plea. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav rejected the bail plea of one Tabassum, observing that her interrogation was necessary to unearth the conspiracy involved in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration in northeast Delhi in February 2020.

A resident of Chand Bagh area, Tabassum has been booked in connection with a case related to the murder of Delhi Police head constable Rattan Lal during the riots.

“Applicant has been clearly and categorically named by independent eye-witnesses in their statements... The allegations against her are grave in nature. The presence/appearance of the applicant is very much necessary to unearth the conspiracy involved in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of the communal conflagration. This court has already dismissed the regular as well as interim bail applications of several co-accused persons in the matter,"" the Additional Session Judge observed.

Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for Delhi Police, opposed the plea for relief, pointing out that Tabassum was linked to the brutal murder of head constable Rattan Lal during the riots, in which a deputy commissioner of police, an assistant commissioner and 51 other policemen also suffered severe injuries at the hands of the rioters.

Prasad argued that the applicant shared a stage with other protesters and instigated the gathering against the government of India, which ultimately led to the death of more than 50 innocent persons in the riots.

The prosecution also cited the analysis of call detail records (CDR) of Tabassum, arguing that it revealed that she had been in regular touch with the main conspirators/other co-accused persons in the matter as well as with the accused persons arrested in case, which is being investigated by the Special Cell of Delhi Police.

Prasad said several efforts were made to make Tabassum join the investigation, but she has been deliberately evading the probe, and now non-bailable warrants (NBWs) have been issued against her by the court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in northeast Delhi.

Advocate Dinesh Tiwari, representing the applicant, argued that she had been falsely implicated in the matter by the investigating agency and had nothing to do with the incident. Tiwari also highlighted that the investigation in the matter is complete and a chargesheet has already been filed. He argued that the applicant is a permanent resident of Delhi and there are no chances of her absconding or tampering with the prosecution witnesses.

At least 53 people lost their lives and over hundreds were injured in the communal violence, which erupted groups supporting and opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the northeast area of the capital in February this year.

HYDERABAD: A scientist with the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), Subhadeep Chatterjee , and University of Hyderabad faculty member, Surajit Dhara , were awarded with the prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) prize for outstanding contribution in science and technology, on Saturday.

The SSB prize , named after the founder director of Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), late Dr Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar, is awarded annually for notable and outstanding research, applied or fundamental, in seven disciplines.

While Chatterjee has been given the honour for his contribution in the area of biological sciences, Dhara has won the awarded for his work in the physical sciences’ discipline.

The UoH faculty member was acknowledged for his research, in his field of work, in the last five years.

“It was a tough competition to bag this recognition. I am glad that my contributions to the field of physical sciences were recognised as this award will be a footing to pursue better research work in this area,” Dhara told TOI.

Congratulating its team member, CDFD also lauded the achievements of Chatterjee, head of the laboratory of plant-microbe interactions, at the institute.

“He has been selected for this award for his outstanding contributions in identification of reversible non-genetic heterogeneity in bacterial quorum sensing (QS) and providing novel insights into the mechanisms by which the Xanthomonas group of phytopathogens which causes several economically important plant diseases, coordinate virulence functions and lifestyle transitions by sensing cell density and iron availability,” read a press release issued by CDFD.

113,['27/09/2020'],Disabled government worker sits on dharna over transfer order,"BELAGAVI: A physically challenged government employee is sitting on a dharna from the past two days at the child development and protection office (CDPO), demanding implementation of her transfer order .

Umadevi Venkatagiri ,47, has an impeccable service record of over 16 years, as she worked as a supervisor at various districts in the CDPO. Presently, she has been transferred from Magadi to Ramadurga taluk in Belagavi , which is her hometown. However, the taluk CDPO officer refused to admit her to perform her work, citing non-availability of order copy. Angered by this development, Umadevi, who was finally hoping to live at her hometown full-time, decided to sit on a dharna by braving torrential rain.

Umadevi said that she worked for a year at Magadi in Ramanagara district, before moving to Ramadurga taluk on deputation. Umadevi worked on deputation here for three years and on September 18 she received a transfer order which she had requested. Umadevi was transferred by taking into consideration her disabilities. “Things turned ugly after the taluk CDPO refused to admit me, saying he is yet to receive an order copy. He was lying through his teeth, as the officer knew that he was expecting the order copy,” she said.

Umadevi further said that she waited for a week and decided to sit on a dharna at the CDPO office to highlight her plight. On Thursday, the woman accompanied by her family members sat in protest. Pavankumar, a sibling of Umadevi, said despite being disabled, she worked in Ballari, Ramanagara, Hassan and other far-flung places. Now a taluk-level officer is playing with her future, and the dharna will go on until Umadevi gets justice, he said.

The deputy director of the CDPO said he went through her file after she sat on dharna, and found that the transfer order was put on hold. “Now we have been informed about the protest. The government will soon resolve her problem,” he said.

114,['27/09/2020'],No diversion of GST cess: Govt after CAG report,"NEW DELHI: The government has dismissed suggestions of diverting GST compensation cess into its books and said that the money was temporarily lying in the Consolidated Fund of India, pending reconciliation. In its latest report , the Comptroller and Auditor General of India had said that during 2017-18 and 201819, there was “short crediting” of compensation cess of around Rs 47,000 crore, which resulted in over-statement of the Centre’s revenue receipts and understatement of fiscal deficit.The finance ministry chose to respond to political criticism from Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac, who had alleged “diversion” of funds. Denying the charge, a government source said: “…whatsoever was the compensation due to the states for the year 2017-18 and 201819 were fully paid and the time taken in reconciliation of compensation receipts can’t be termed as diversion of GST Cess Fund when the dues were fully released by the central government.”Finance ministry officials said the compensation receipt in the CFI was subject to reconciliation in the coming months in the subsequent financial year. “If for that reason the amount remained in the Consolidated Fund of India, how can that be treated as ‘diversion’? Even the CAG in its report has not said so,” a source said. Officials said in line with the Constitutional provi sions, receipts — including taxes and cess — collected by the Centre need to be first credited into CFI before being transferred to another fund through a budget head. In case of the GST compensation cess, officials said since the final accounts are known only after the end of the financial year, usually around June-end, the excess amount temporarily stays in CFI.“After reconciliation, the amount is transferred to Compensation Fund and from that Fund to states as per their compensation formula,” a source said. During 2017-18, Rs 62,611 crore was collected as compensation cess and Rs 41,146 crore was paid to states. In 2018-19, against collections of Rs 95,081 crore, Rs 69,275 crore was paid. While Rs 47,271 crore did remain unutilised for reconciliation after payment of all the dues, the money has been used up subsequently. “Therefore, it can’t be said that this Rs 47,721 crore was diverted for other uses,” said a source.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78342295,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-63893,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-diversion-of-gst-cess-govt-after-cag-report/articleshow/78342219.cms

Vadodara: While there has been no significant rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city and district during the 24 hours ending on Saturday evening, the testing of samples went down on the second consecutive day. As many as 126 samples were found positive from 4,318 tests conducted since Friday evening.

With the fresh cases, the total number of positive cases detected in the city and district since the pandemic began went up to 11,318. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) confirmed two more deaths that took the toll due to Covid-19 in the city and district to 190.

The decrease in testing numbers is being attributed to the delay in arrival of results or lesser number of people turning up at health centres for tests. Sources said that the health centres were open for testing, but it seems that there were fewer persons with upper respiratory infections or flu-like symptoms who wanted to get themselves tested.

On Saturday, 94 persons were discharged taking the total number of discharges in the city and district up to 9,543. This leaves 1,585 persons under treatment including 66 on ventilators and BiPAP machines and 176 on oxygen support.

PUNE: The state water resources department on Saturday said it would finalize the winter water supply schedule for the city and rural parts only after mid-October.The department is adopting this wait-and-watch policy as monsoon is yet to exit the state and more rainfall is expected in the catchments of the four dams that supply water to the city and the rural parts.Heavy rainfall in September has helped fill all water sources and ponds in the rural parts of the district to the brim, water resources officials said, adding that this would meet the demand for drinking water and irrigation for the next few months. The officials further said they would hold a review meeting after mid-October to take stock of the storage scenario in the reservoirs.On Saturday, the collective water storage in the four reservoirs — Khadakwasla, Panshet, Varasgaon and Temghar — stood at 29 TMC (99%).“The catchments of the four reservoirs received good rainfall in September. Water was released into the Mutha canal, which further flowed to all the water sources, like ponds, wells and bunds in Baramati, Indapur and Daund. All these water sources are filled to capacity, ensuring availability to smaller towns and villages dependent on these sources for drinking water,” a water resources official said.Officials said a delay in the withdrawal of monsoon will help them store more water in the reservoirs, which would ultimately ensure adequate water supply during the summer months.The increasing demand for water has spurred elected representatives in the district, as well as the irrigation department, to initiate a study on the implementation of water supply schemes for Indapur, adjoining areas and Mulshi, which would provide additional water.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78345543,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-44747,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/september-showers-fill-water-sources-in-rural-areas-to-the-brim/articleshow/78340386.cms

PUNE: A panel comprising activists , experts and former bureaucrats have warned that the city could face severe floods in the future if the administration did not learn from last year’s flooding.

At an online event organized by civic engagement platform Bhavatal, the panel said the vast majority of factors that caused last year’s devastating floods have still not been addressed.

The panel included environmental activist Sarang Yadwadkar and former Pune municipal commissioner Mahesh Zagade, among others.

Among the issues that panel flagged included the — often illegal — shifting of the demarcated flood lines, nullahs and canals in the city. They also mentioned the lack of action on illegal waste-dumping and encroachments around the nullahs, which flow into rivers in and around Pune.

“The situation is extremely dire in Pune. Waste and construction debris is being dumped illegally along the rivers, construction is going on as well, violating the flood lines. The local ward offices do nothing about it. Even if a court orders debris to be removed, nothing is done about it,” Yadwadkar told TOI.

A TERI report in 2014, commissioned by the state government, showed a significant increase in average annual rainfall in parts of the state over the next four to five decades.

“I saw during my tenure (2010-11) that many natural water sources that drain into the rivers have been re-aligned for construction. Many of the canals stop abruptly at certain places. Flooding is a result of greed and mismanagement,” Zagade said.

The proposal would be submitted to the district committee of Forest Rights Act.

At least 23 families, which were forced to relocate to the quarters of Thaimudi tea estate near Valparai, have been demanding the district administration to provide them land at Theppakulamedu, which is just 3km away from their settlement, as alternative location.

An official with the sub-committee of Forest Rights Act, said, “Residents of Kallar settlement have been requesting us to provide them land at Theppakulamedu ever since their houses were damaged in 2019. Based on their request, we surveyed the land on Saturday.” He was part of the team that inspected the location.

He said a proposal recommending patta for the families at Theppakulamedu would be submitted to the district committee, the decision of which would be final on the issue.

S Anish Kumar, 23, a resident, said, “During a meeting last week, officials had assured to take steps to provide land patta at Theppakulamedu to 21 families that were living at Kallar settlement in 2005. Now, we are confident that we would get pattas at the location we sought.” They had staged a protest on August 15, pressing for their demand.

Anish Kumar said most of the huts were damaged in August 2019, when heavy rain triggered landslips. “When we attempted to reconstruct them, officials prevented us and assured to provide us an alternative location within 10 days. We were then moved to the tea estate quarters, where 23 families are residing in just six houses.”

HYDERABAD: A day after resumption of city services, Telangana State Road Transport Corporation ( TSRTC ) has decided to also start inter-state operations to Karnataka and Maharashtra from Monday. However, there is still no clarity on when services will resume to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh

Around 350 buses operate between Telangana and the two states. “Since we do not know what the response will be and how many people will travel to other states under the current situation, we will initially start operations with 50% buses and then take a decision as per the demand,” TSRTC chief traffic manager Muni Shekar said.

Simultaneously, the corporations of Karnataka and Maharashtra states would also restore their operation to Telangana. The officials further informed that the inter-state operations between these states would resume operations on all major routes except Bengaluru until further orders. Important routes are Raichur, Yadgir, Bidar, Nanded, Mumbai, Pune, Gulbarga, Nagpur, Chandrapur, Udgir and a handful of services to Mumbai and Pune.

On the other hand, the decision to resume inter-state bus services between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh is yet to be taken as the authorities are yet to come to a conclusion on the ‘reciprocal agreement.’

The agreement allows plying of TSRTC buses in AP and those of APSRTC in Telangana. Post bifurcation of the state, the reciprocal agreement has not been signed between the two states. Earlier this month, TSRTC officials made proposals on operating an equal number of buses on said routes. APSRTC officials have been asked to reduce their bus operations and operate equally with TSRTC.

Speaking to TOI, TSRTC ED E Yadagiri said, “The decision on inter-state services between Telangana and AP is yet to be taken. We are right now waiting for their response on a proposal we made at the last meeting.” “The services to Bengaluru have also been stalled for time being because we have to pass through Andhra Pradesh to reach Bengaluru,” he added.

INDORE: In the run-up to by-polls on 28 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and BJP Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiradtiya Scindia addressed public gatherings at poll-bound Badnawar, Sanwer and Hatpipliya Vidhan Sabha seat s in Indore-Ujjain division on Saturday.

The duo launched a scathing attack on senior Congress leaders and accused Congress of betraying the people in the state.

Scindia said that it was his belief that the previous Congress government will increase the ‘line’ of development that was earlier drawn by CM Chouhan . “What we saw in reality is a long line of betrayal and corruption” hesaid, adding that they (Congress) say Tulsiram Silawat and Scindia are traitors and ‘ nalayak ’ (unworthy) to CM Chouhan. “It’s those who blackened their own ‘dharamgrantha’ (manifesto) by not fulfilling the promises are the real traitors,” he said.

Recalling history, the Rajya Sabha MP said that like his grandmother Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia and father Madhavrao, who taught a lesson to Congress, he blamed the opposition party and accused it of treachery and fooling the farmers.

BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya also targeted Congress and said he feels sad by the kind of words the party is using against Scindia by calling him a ‘traitor’. “It’s Congress, which did not fulfill its promises to waive off agriculture loans of farmers and they are the traitors”, he said, further urging the gathering to extend their support to ensure Silawat’s victory with a huge margin.

CM Chouhan also alleged that Congress and its leaders have betrayed the public of the state.

“Was it not treachery with the farmers for not waiving off their farm loans as promised” he said, adding that “Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh call Scindiaji and Tulsiram Silawat traitors. But I want to ask them what is (Premchand Guddu), whom Congress has selected for the Sanwer assembly seat (as candidate) ”.

“It’s because of him (Guddu), we failed to make the government (in 2018)” the CM said. He also took a dig at Nath. “If you all think that Scindiaji and Silawat had done a good job by toppling the Congress government, you (people) should give an answer to those (Congress), who call (them) traitors by ensuring a win orf BJP in Sanwer” Chouhan said.

HUBBALLI: The campaign against the poor conditions of roads in Hubballi-Dharwad is gaining momentum on various social media platforms.

People are posting some unique pictures to highlight the pathetic condition of roads in different commercial and posh areas with catchy captions to draw the attention of authorities and elected representatives to take up repairs.

Amogh Pujar, an activist and the admin of a social media group called Pot Holes Hubli, said, “It’s very unfortunate we have campaigned about the pathetic condition of roads in Hubballi for six to seven years Hubballi city, but there has been no impact. Every year authorities take up repairs and potholes appear at the same spots within no time.”

“Till date no officials or elected representatives have thought of a permanent solution to potholes,” he said.

“The HDMC commissioner should ensure quality work in pothole filling and road repairs. There is also onus on the elected representatives who should frequently use the roads to check their condition and ensure officials work appropriately,” he added.

Rajat Ullagaddimath, another activist, said, “We have launched a social media campaign to highlight poor condition of roads . To begin with, we had planted saplings in potholes in front of former chief minister Jagadish Shettar’s house recently. Now we are highlighting the potholes on major roads in Hubballi.”

BJP Hubballi-Dharwad Central BJP president Santhosh Chavan cited the Covid-19 pandemic and rain for the delay in road works. “District minister Jagadish Shettar has issued strict instructions to HDMC officials to take up road repair works and ensure quality while restoring roads,” he said.

HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said, “We had planned to take up road works before it started raining. But due to the lockdown no construction work was allowed. Now, we have completed the tendering process and are waiting for the rains to stop to start repair works.”

PUNE: The mother of a braindead woman (21) donated her vital organs to give a new life to four patients suffering from end-stage heart, liver, pancreas and kidney diseases in Pune and Nashik on Saturday. This is the 11th organ donation during the Covid-ensued lockdown in Pune and 25th since January this year.

“The organ donation has led to the first successful heart transplant at Sahyadri hospital in Pune this year,” Aarti Gokhale, transplant coordinator of the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee , said.

Relatives of four brain-dead patients have donated heart this year so far. But in earlier three cases, the retrieved organ was transported to other cites for transplants.

Heart transplant team at the Sahyadri hospital, Deccan, led by transplant surgeon Manoj Durairaj performed the heart transplant on a 49-yearold woman from Manjari. “The transplanted heart is beating normally in the recipient,” Durairaj said.

The donor, a resident of Wakad, worked as a technician at a pathology laboratory in Pune. On September 21, she suffered giddiness and was rushed to the Aditya Birla hospital. “She had suffered intracranial bleeding. On September 24, she was declared braindead. Her mother consented to organ donation the next day,” said hospital’s transplant coordinator Bobin Mathew.

PANAJI: The sessions court Panaji denied bail to an accused arrested by the economic offences cell for duping investors to the tune of Rs 1.40 crores promising good returns.

The court found that the accused Ameet Savant allegedly committed a very serious offence of cheating investors by collecting money from them with the intention to defraud them. He has been charged with criminal breach of trust.

The court observed that the accused cannot be granted bail because an offence under Section 409 of the IPC and Section 5 of the Goa Protection of Interests of Depositors (In Financial Establishments) Act, 1999, are both punishable up to ten years. “An offence which is punishable for more than 7 years is considered as a serious offence,” the court held.

The accused submitted to the court that he should be granted bail as there are inmates who have tested positive at Colvale jail and that there were Supreme Court and high court orders in March and April, issuing directions to release accused persons on account of the pandemic.

The court however held that the judgements by the high court and Supreme court don’t apply to accused persons involved in “serious crimes”.

A complaint was filed by Rohit Chopra of cheating and fraud by Goa franchise of Ventura Securities Ltd. The franchise in Goa is owned by Ameet Savant who took money from Chopra and others to the tune of Rs 1.40 crores promising good returns. It was found that that the franchise holder opened many accounts in different banks in the name of the company and accepted money from the public.

The number of active cases rose to 4,859 on the day, despite 595 patients getting discharged from treatment centres.

The toll shot up to 413 with the state including five more Covid-19 deaths that occurred in the district in the bulletin.

The state government, meanwhile, asked the district administration to do the needful to arrest the daily spike in cases to less than 100 and the death rate to below 1%. While the death rate, which is at 1.4%, could be brought down to under 1% in a few days, bringing the number of fresh cases down to less than 100 from more than 600 cases a day seems to be an uphill task for officials.

The state has also asked the district administration to bring down the positivity rate to less than 5%.

District collector K Rajamani said, “We have been asked to cordon off streets or areas with four to five cases as containment zones and ensure there is no movement there. The government has also directed us to test all primary contacts of positive cases since testing secondary contacts is not practical with the relaxing of lockdown norms.”

He said they would resume door-to-door surveillance in the neighbourhood of containment zones to trace people with symptoms of Covid-19 and test them.

The government has also asked the district to conduct fever camps in containment zones, as that would yield more desired results.

A health department official said, “We have been asked to organize fever camps in areas where cases are recurring and streets with high number of cases, rather than randomly selecting a location. While randomly selecting locations will help reduce the positivity rate, it won’t help detect asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases and control the spread.”

125,['27/09/2020'],Vaccination important for rabies prevention: Expert,"Nagpur: ‘End Rabies: Collaborate, Vaccinate’, is the theme for this year’s World Rabies Day, which is observed on September 28 to raise awareness about rabies. The day marks the death anniversary of Louis Paster, who developed the first rabies vaccine and lead the foundation for rabies prevention.

In view of this, the Tropical and Geographical Neurology Specialty Group of World Federation of Neurology (WFN) in collaboration with Indian Academy of Neurology and Forum for Indian Neurology Education had organized a talk on rabies by Thiravat Hemachudha, professor of neurology at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, during the first session of WFN Neuroinfection Series 2.

Dr Hemachudha, who is doing research on rabies for more than 20 years in collaboration with World Health Organization, emphasized on the importance of pre-exposure and post-exposure vaccination for rabies prevention. He said rabies is the most deadly viral infection with almost 100% mortality and is transmitted mainly by dog bite.

“Patient develops symptoms usually in 20 to 60 days after the bite, but sometimes as late as two years. Patients with furious rabies survive on average for 5-7 days while patients with paralytic rabies survive for 11 days,” he said and added that as there is no treatment, we need collaborative efforts from community, dog owners, educators, media, policymakers, researchers, veterinarians, medical staff and vaccine clinics for control of rabies.

He mentioned that 10% of mice with rabies survived after use of antiviral drug Favipiravir but studies in human are not done yet.

President of WFN, professor William Carroll inaugurated the series containing eight sessions. In his address, he mentioned that the mission of WFN is to promote brain health and quality neurological care worldwide and expressed concern over inequality of neurological care in developing countries.

Carroll congratulated Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram and his team for organizing the educational activity to spread the message of neuroinfections and importance of brain health. He further said that corona pandemic may be a silver lining for learning opportunity through webinars and electronic media.

The session was chaired by professor Raad Shakir, past president of WFN, and professor Wolfgang Grisold, secretary general of WFN.

After the talk, interesting cases were presented by Prakit Anukoolwittaya, Natchawan Tantithanarat and Danist Leosuthamas from Thailand.

While rabies is a 100% preventable disease, there are about 59,000 deaths due to human rabies every year in the world and India alone accounts for 20,000 deaths. This figure could be much higher as many patients die undiagnosed and many are not reported. Of all deaths, 90% are from rural areas.

Rabies is a major public health problem in India and it is endemic throughout the country. In India, due to high population of stray dogs, there is one dog bite every two seconds. Rabies is one of the oldest diseases known to mankind and ideally, no human should die from rabies in the 21st century.

But in India, there is one death due to rabies, every 25 minutes, informed Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram, president of Tropical Neurology Group of WFN and course director of the series. “Vaccination of dogs, access to good treatment after dog bite including vaccination and reducing risk of animal bite are key factors for control of rabies,” he said.

126,['27/09/2020'],Cong asks EC to remove Indore collector for free fuel order,"Bhopal: State Congress on Saturday lodged a complaint to the Election Commission, demanding the immediate removal of Indore district collector Manish Singh to ensure free and fair bypolls in Sanwer assembly constituency.

The opposition party alleged that the collector issued instructions to food department officials to arrange for free fuel in 600 buses to bring people for chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s programme held in Sanwer on Saturday.

Congress has fielded former MP Premchand Guddu from Sanwer and he is likely to take on cabinet minister and Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalist Tulsi Silawat, who left Congress party in March along with rebel MLAs that led to the toppling the Kamal Nath government.

Congress’ Rajya Sabha MP Vivek Tankha tweeted, “In Indore, diesel for buses coming for the chief minister’s programme are being fuelled by the food department. In a political programme, the government has taken out an order and instructed petrol pumps to fuel buses. The question is, who will make the payments? Gross misuse of government machinery. Expect action from @ECISVEEP and the chief secretary.”

Tankha also wrote a letter to chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains, regarding the order issued by the food department. He also said that the chief secretary should initiate action under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Dated September 4, an order from the state food department to petrol pumps said, “Honourable chief minister of Madhya Pradesh has a programme in Sanwer on September 26. Following the instructions of the collector, transport has been arranged to bring people who want to participate in the programme. The mentioned list of petrol pumps is being instructed to avail diesel and petrol for vehicles authorised by officials.”

The list included the names of petrol pumps and their owners who would fill fuel for the buses.

State Congress chief (EC affairs) J P Dhanopia took the matter to the poll panel office here in Bhopal. Speaking to TOI, he said, “In Sanwer assembly seat, CM Chouhan is organising public meetings and other functions, which BJP claims are government events. But the truth is that the public meetings are meant to campaign for party candidate and minister Tulsi Silawat. During the programme, BJP leaders will be present, the party’s flags and posters will be installed, slogans will be shouted and appeals will be made to cast votes on the lotus symbol.”

Dhanopia claimed that district collector issued an order that 600 buses arranged to transport people will get free fuel. “Collector Manish Singh is a favourite of CM Chouhan and we have complained to the EC that he has to be removed or else there cannot be a free and fair elections in Sanwer seat,” he said.

127,['27/09/2020'],Covid-19 curve on the rise again,"Coimbatore: The district is seeing yet another spike in Covid-19 cases after a dip in recent times. And it’s the only district in the state where the Covid curve has risen as many as four times after downward curve.

Two days after the district recorded 642 new cases of Covid-19, the curve is now on the ascent again. This is when other major cities such as Madurai and Chennai have managed to keep the curve downward or nearly flat after the three-week lockdown in June-end. Public health experts don’t seem to have any answers for the district’s failure to contain the virus spread.

In April first week, the district saw its Covid-19 curve spiralling up, recording more than 90 cases in two weeks, as the Tablighi Jamaat cluster was formed. However, containment measures and contact tracing ensured the curve moved downwards and stayed down and flattened at 146 cases in May first week. The curve then began an upward climb since June-end, when flights were reintroduced and e-pass restrictions were relaxed.

The daily spike hit a peak of 313 on July 27, but only to dip to 213-250 cases from August 1 to 9 and then to increase to more than 300 cases from August 11. During this upward ascent of the curve, the district had seen 593 cases on September 3 alone. However, the cases slowly reduced and dipped to 398 on September 11. The curve then began to rise with the district recording 646 new cases on Monday (September 21).

Dr T S Selvavinayagam, director of public health, said, “There is not a single reason that can be highlighted for the repeated increase. We are planning to intensify containment measures by studying street-wise spread and conducting fever camps in such areas. So, our measures would be more effective.”

Public health experts, however, cited ineffective containment measures and the spread-out population in the district as reasons for the zig-zag Covid curve, where peaks are always higher than the last one.

Dr K Kolandaisamy, former director of public health, said, “Usually, the curve moves up when a large cluster forms. The recent spike is because the virus is spreading slowly in the district, compared to Madurai and Chennai, where the spread was fast because of higher population density. In densely populated area, the virus spreads in one go and then recedes. In a spread-out area, the virus spreads slowly, causing a spike every time it hits a new area.”

Experts said the effectiveness of containment measures should also be studied. Jayaprakash Muliyil, epidemiologist and chairman - scientific advisory committee of the National Institute of Epidemiology, said, “Instead of limiting contact tracing of a positive case to just the immediate family, officials should study the network the case belongs to. For instance, if a domestic maid has tested positive for the virus, officials should study her residential area, houses she visits for work and test the employers and from there continue to keep tracing the spread. Officials have to do this for every case and study which strata of the population is getting affected right now and devise a plan to control it.”

He said testing just the immediate family members or neighbours wasn’t enough. Muliyil also suggested a sero survey for the district to understand the most infected areas, the extent of population affected and the extent of population still vulnerable. “Based on that, devise a plan to protect the vulnerable.”

Fond of the juicy sugarcane, elephants tend to enter human habitats, causing man-elephant conflict situations. In the past, this has led to massive crop damage, attacks on farmers and brutal killings of elephants.

According to foresters, there are more than 205 elephants in Bijnor district's Najibabad and Bijnor divisions Out of these, more than 100 are in Amangarh Tiger Reserve, which is adjacent to the agricultural fields. Hence, the threat from elephants is of jumbo proportions.

Forest department has also asked farmers to spray only bio pesticides on their crop to prevent any harm to the elephants.

M Semmaran, Bijnor divisional forest officer (DFO), said, ""Our staff is on the alert. To prevent man-elephant conflict, farmers are being sensitized not to go alone to the fields located in areas bordering forests.""

Najibabad DFO Manoj Kumar Shukla said, ""We are planning to hold an awareness programme for the villagers. We have urged farmers to inform the authorities if they spot any elephant or leopard in the area.""

131,['27/09/2020'],TOI webinar today to discuss education during pandemic,"Pune: Schools in some states opened this week after a gap of six months to a host of new Covid-19 guidelines.

According to reports, at least eight states opened classrooms on a voluntary basis — from classes 9 to 12 — for the first time since the lockdowns began in March.

By the end of this month, more states are expected to welcome students back.

To discuss the state of education during the outbreak, TOI has invited Prafulla Pawar, registrar of the Savitribai Phule Pune University and Amruta Prabhu, principal of the HDFC School at Magarpatta City, to be part of an expert panel. They will take questions from readers on higher education, the roadmap for schools and other relevant topics.

Worldwide, governments are looking for ways to reopen educational institutions (and keep them open). In France for example, a country which is currently reporting a fresh spike in cases, students have been distanced inside classrooms and masks have been made mandatory on the playgrounds. But medical professionals have argued that children as young as six or older should be asked to wear masks (France has made masks compulsory from 11 years of age or above).

Then there’s education via screens.

In many parts of the country, classroom education has made a seamless transition to the internet. Scores of teachers are now tackling complicated subjects and receiving questions from students. The best efforts are being made to replicate a classroom environment despite students being kilometres away from each other. However, there have been niggles as far as connectivity and equipment are concerned.

133,['27/09/2020'],"Airport runway’s re-carpeting work takes off, to halt flight movements next summer","Air Marshal Bhushan Gokhale (Retd)

A mile of highway will take you just one mile... but a mile of runway will take you anywhere” goes the adage.The re-carpeting of the crucial 2,530-metre stretch, connecting Pune to places miles away, is under way after more than 10 years and would not be available for about a fortnight next summer.Flying away from the city would be out of question for almost 15 days in May because of the total shutdown of the Lohegaon airport’s runway. True, air movement during summer holidays would be hit for the second year on the trot because of the runway re-carpeting work, after the Covid-19-induced restrictions in 2020. But it is a necessary pause for safe flying in years ahead.Unlike Delhi, which has three runways, and Mumbai, which has a cross runway, the city’s airport has only a single runway. As a result, the movement of flights would be affected during the re-carpeting work.Almost every runway has two sections — concrete parts on the either side of the strip and the blacktop (flexible) in between them. The re-carpeting of the concrete portion on the eastern side of the Lohegaon airport’s runway has started. The work on the flexible portion will start from January 21.There will be no flight movements from 8pm to 8am from the end of next month. The last departure after October 26 would be at 7.30pm as the contractor would need some time for preparations before starting the re-carpeting work. The daily sorties of Sukhoi fighter jets during the morning block would not be happening to make room for more commercial flights.During the whole process, VFR (visual flight rules) would be followed by the pilots. The IFR (instrument flight rules) would be on pause. Under VFR, a pilot operates an aircraft based on what can be seen visually. The planning has been done in such a way that about 100 to 110 flights can operate every day between 8am and 8pm.The Pune airport is a strategic defence airbase, housing squadrons of Sukhoi-30MK-I fighter jets. Both, the runway and the air traffic control of the airport, are under control of the Indian Air Force. So, re-carpeting of its runway is of utmost importance because it goes through different forms of impacts, wears and tears with flights continuously landing and taking off.Several factors contribute to the necessity of runway maintenance and re-carpeting. First, the momentum of planes. The weight of a Boeing 737 is approximately 70,500kg during take-off and around 55,000kg during landing. Similarly, a Sukhoi-30 fighter weighs around 35,000kg during take-off and around 25,000kg during landing. The momentum at which they impact the runway during landings has an impact on the runway, thus making it an important aspect of runway re-carpeting.The impact on the runway hinges on the type of landing, too. Be it firm, kisser or bad landing, each one affects the surface in different ways.The high temperature jet fuel exhaust from aircraft, anything between 800°C and 900°C, also heats up the runway. It leads to wears and tears, besides contributing to accumulation of rubber residue of planes’ tyres on the runway.If one looks at the aircraft accidents worldwide, close to 90% occur during take-offs and landings. And runways have a role to play in most of them. So, its upkeep is crucial.The Lohegaon airport runway consists of five layers below the surface. The re-carpeting work would involve improving each layer and compressing the surfaces.As the work progresses, the effective runway length would keep shrinking. It would have an impact on flight movements. The airlines will have to take care of the load factor, including fuel, passengers and cargo, for their operations.Almost every 10 years, recarpeting of the runway has to be done. The Lohegaon facility lacks space for a second runway. And here comes the vision of decision-makers of the city in play.The expansion of the Lohegaon facility will keep the airport operational for some more time. However, looking at shortsighted gains will do no good. A new airport is a must for the Pune region.(As told to Joy Sengupta)",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78345584,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-111512,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/runway-re-carpeting-work-to-halt-flight-operations-next-summer/articleshow/78340420.cms
134,['27/09/2020'],Preliminary work begins on Avinashi Road flyover,"Coimbatore: The state highways department has launched preliminary work for the elevated highway project along Avinashi Road.

The 10.01km elevated highway will connect Uppilipalayam to Goldwins at a cost of Rs 1,621.3 crore. The state government has allotted 200 crore for the project.

Construction is expected to commence within a month and will be completed within four years, an official said. “We are marking the spots where 397 piers will be constructed. The piers will be buried five to six metres deep. Underground and overhead utilities like electric cables, BSNL cables and pipelines laid by the city corporation and the Tamil Nadu Water and Drainage board will be removed. We have informed the departments concerned. The cost of removing them is estimated to be Rs 50 crore,” he said.

Up and down ramps will be constructed at four locations – Anna Statue, Nava India, Hopes College and airport – to reduce traffic congestion. As much as 18,000 square metres will be acquired for constructing the ramps.

When the flyover is opened up for traffic, commuters on the Uppilipalayam-Goldwins stretch can avoid 12 traffic signals and save 15 to 20 minutes, the official said. “It has been designed based on the predicted traffic flow on the road 15 years down the line.”

It would be better if construction work on Avinashi Road is started after the completion of flyover construction on Trichy Road, said R Sivaraju, a commuter. “By doing so, public can use a road when construction is going on the other. Otherwise, it might cause huge traffic congestion on both the roads.”

School management associations have contested this move, stating it is not in the government’s powers to bar schools from salary cuts or layoffs.The matter was discussed at a recent meeting between the state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama and school authorities where the latter accepted the government’s proposal to reduce tuition fees by 25% for the 2020-21 academic year due to the Covid-19 crisis Many schools have laid off teachers and cut salaries in the past six months after schools were closed in mid-March due to the Covid pandemic. Jatin Bharad , vice-president of Self-Financed Schools Management Association of Gujarat said the association cannot give any such assurance. “The decision to cut salaries or downsize staff strength is with self-financed schools and the association has no role to play in it,” said Bharad.He said the brunt of the 25% fee cut will go to the salary of schoolteachers.Archit Bhatt, former president of Ahmedabad Progressive School Management Association said after the formation of the Fee Regulatory Authority, schools do not have excess funds.

Currently, in government hospitals, doctors are given an additional charge of administrative work, while in the private sector, hospitals employ MBA graduates to do marketing. “We are suggesting that IMS be brought in and made compulsory for both the sectors. One of the major learning from the pandemic is that healthcare industry needs both humanity and profit-making skills,” Indian Medical Association (IMA), Telangana , general secretary Sanjeev Singh Yadav said.Healthcare industry insiders believe having an MBBS graduate trained in administration would equip them better to handle a crisis like Covid-19 in future as compared to a civil servant. “In fact, there was a plan to have this kind of a system in the state previously, but it has not taken off,” admitted a senior health official.Also, coordination issues and carrying out directives of the Centre by the state government can be sorted out by a centralised administrative service. “IMS can bridge the gap between decisions taken by the government and delivery of the health service.

138,['27/09/2020'],East UP dons hit more in economic crackdown,"MEERUT: In one of the most coordinated crackdowns against 25 dreaded criminals in the state, properties worth Rs 160 crore have either been attached or demolished in police and administrative action initiated against them.

A lion's share of the crackdown was dedicated against two criminals – Mukhtar Ansari, currently lodged in a jail in Punjab, and Atiq Ahmad, lodged in Ahmedabad jail, with Rs 65 crore each (total 130 crore) worth of properties owned by them or their associates now attached or demolished.

Recently, in coordinated raids at 42 places in Lucknow targeting Mukhtar Ansari, Salim Rustam Sohrab, Khan Mubarak and Annu Triapthi gangs, 11 criminals were arrested and over two dozen detained. Arms, ammunition, explosives and satellite phones were among recoveries made during the raids.

Meanwhile, there is conspicuous “inaction” when it comes to similar crackdown against hardened criminals in crime-infested western part of the state, especially Meerut zone – home to some of the dreaded gangsters.

Six hardened criminals of Meerut zone, including Udham Singh, Yogesh Bhadora and Sushil Mooch, all in jail, feature in the list, but the action report doesn't match the crackdown on eastern UP dons in terms of severity.

While most of the illegally owned properties of the Mukhtar, Atiq and Bhati gangs are either being demolished or attached, the action report for Meerut zone gangsters has little information on such properties or it says “information is being gathered about their assets”.

Top police officials claim the difference in severity of the action in two parts of the state is because of the style of operation of criminals, especially those in eastern UP, who prefer grandeur as compared to the modest lifestyle of west UP criminals.

“That (crackdown) speaks volumes about the scale of operations these two criminals (Mukhtar and Atiq) are involved in. In other parts of the state, for instance western region, criminals generally belong to the rural belt and do not invest so lavishly on immovable properties. But still we have seized landholdings and other possessions here as well,” Prashant Kumar, additional director general (law and order), said.

139,['27/09/2020'],Bizman’s SUV stolen from Koregaon Park,"Pune: A bakery businessman from Koregaon Park on Friday lodged a complaint stating that his high-end sports utility vehicle, a Ford Endeavour worth Rs30 lakh, was stolen by a person wearing a raincoat on Thursday.

The businessman, Shivdeep Deokar (31), said the vehicle was parked outside his bungalow on Thursday. “I had purchased the car in 2019. On September 22, we started the work of replacing the old tiles from the parking area and had been parking the vehicle outside the main gate since,” Deokar told TOI.

“A week before the incident, I realised that the ignition key of the SUV was stolen and had to use a spare key. Around 1.30pm on Thursday, my mother called me and inquired as to what time would I return home, as she could not see my car parked outside the bungalow. I told her that I was in the house. I rushed out and saw my car was not there,” Deokar said.

“A CCTV camera installed in the bungalow captured images of a person wearing a raincoat opening the door lock with a key and driving away in the car, possibly with the help of the stolen ignition key, on Thursday,” he said.

The businessman said even though the police had taken his driver into custody for questioning, he didn’t suspect the latter’s involvement in the theft. “He has been with our family for two years now,” Deokar said.

He stated that with the police, studying CCTV footage collected from different housing societies, found out that the car had entered Magarpatta and drove away in towards Mundhwa.

“The SUV does not have a GPS tracker. We are analysing CCTV footage, checking criminals involved in stealing SUVs and hope to arrest the suspect at the earliest,” senior inspector Pramod Patki of the Koregaon Park police said.

141,['27/09/2020'],PG exam of Mangalore University headed for ‘reboot’,"MANGALURU: Sixty-seven final year post-graduate students of Kannada of Mangalore University are facing the prospects of a re-exam . A seeming act of indiscretion by chairman of SVP Kannada Study Centre of the university has brought forth this eventuality. Students were re-scheduled to appear for Kannada Matthu Computer Balake (subject code - KNH 553) on Friday, which was held in four out of five centres except on the Mangalagangothri campus of the university.

The exam for KNH 553 was initially scheduled for September 21. The incident took place on the day that the Syndicate, highest decision making body of the university met. Inquiries made by Syndicate members on complaints from aggrieved PG students indicated that K Abhaya Kumar, chairman called off the exam on grounds that he had not received intimation that that it had been rescheduled for the day and it will be held later.

Refuting this, P L Dharma, registrar (evaluation) told STOI that all communication about examination in wake of the pandemic is being done through e-mails and through the university’s website. Examinations were conducted at the university’s PG centre at Chikkaluvara (12 students), Government First Grade Colleges at Belthangady and Uppinangady (17 and 15 students respectively) and Government First Grade College and PG Centre at Thenkanidiyoor in Udupi (sevent students).

Dharma said he has issued notice to Abhay Kumar which he has to answer in two working days. Vice-Chancellor P S Yadapadithaya will initiate action, if deemed necessary based on the reply, he said. The university has requested heads of remaining centres to urge 49 students who appeared for the examination there to appear for a re-examination. A separate re-exam for 16 students at the PG centre at Mangalagangothri will cause a logistical nightmare.

To an allegation by a Syndicate member that Abhaya Kumar was in an inebriated state, Yadapadithaya said this will be verified independently. “I have directed the registrar (evaluation) to issue notice to the faculty for this lapse. Time-table and the move to defer examination on September 21 to Friday have been communicated electronically to all. New date for the above paper will be communicated shortly, VC said.

142,['27/09/2020'],600 female cadets to take to the skies as part of NCC’s air squadron,"Pune: The NCC Group Headquarter, Pune, will enrol 600 female cadets in its air squadron as part of the Corps expansion approved by the Ministry of Defence this year.

“The girls and women will be selected for junior and senior divisions, respectively. The vacancies will be equal for rural as well as urban schools. Earlier we used to have around 80-90 female air cadets,” said Brigadier Suneel Limaye, group commander of NCC Group Headquarter, Pune. More women from Pune and neighbouring districts will get first-hand flying experience in the coming months.

According to the flight training curriculum of the NCC, an air cadet will accompany an Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot in the cockpit of an aircraft for a sortie that may last around 10-25 minutes. Senior division air cadets, especially those preparing for the Services Selection Board interview, get access to at least four sorites per year.

The squadron conducts an entrance examination and interviews the shortlisted candidates. They get selected for the air squadron based on their performance. They not only get trained for air-borne activities, but also get exposure to other military training and sports. The squadron acquired two Pipistrel Virus SW 80s — high wing microlight aircraft — for training in 2018. The air cadets were trained on the same aircraft at the National Defence Academy’s runway last year.

“During training, the cadets learn about a cockpit, its functions and basic aspects of flying in a real way. This covers the basics of theory as well as practical exercise,” said an NCC officer.

The 3 Maharashtra air squadron (Pune) is among the oldest units of the NCC. It gets over 2,000 air cadets — both females and males — most of whom are from the junior division (classes VIII to IX). The rest are from the senior division, which comprises undergraduates.

The state has three air squadrons in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. The Pune squadron gets air cadets from Pune, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Solapur and some district of Marathwada.

“Since the (IAF) has exempted written examination for those NCC cadets who have cleared “C” certificate examination, it has paved the way for the air cadets to join the force,” the officer added.

Members of Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) staged a protest condemning the bills near south taluk office.

“The bills don’t speak about the minimum support price, which is very important for farmers. Due to this, farmers are not ready to believe the Centre’s statements that they would not affect them. Moreover, from the list of essential commodities, cereals, pulses, oil seeds, onions, and potatoes would be taken off. Due to this, hoarding and black market by corporates can’t be stopped,” he said.

HYDERABAD: A critical component in ICU ventilators is indigenously manufactured and supplied by city-based defence PSU, Midhani , at Kanchanbagh. The 160 micron pure nickel wire used in oxygen sensors for manufacture of 30,000 ventilators was supplied by Midhani.

Bengaluru-based defence PSU, Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), in collaboration with Skanray Technologies Ltd, Mysuru, produced the ventilators on a war-footing in the wake of the Covid-19 situation.

“We have delivered more than the requirement. If necessary, we can provide more at a short notice,” Midhani chairman and managing director Sanjay Kumar Jha told TOI. The Union health ministry took a decision that ICU ventilators should be manufactured indigenously and approached the DRDO with the proposal.

Until the pandemic, ventilators were imported but considering the fact that all countries were affected due to Covid-19 there was a big possibility that the requirement of India may not be met by the international market. That is why the plans for indigenous production was made. While BEL was given the task of manufacturing the equipment, Midhani was asked if it could come up with the pure nickel wire with the specifications. “Within 45 hours, we were able to complete the task given to us. This was done on a war-footing. We had never previously made the nickel wire as per the specification that was required. But, we delivered,” Sanjay Kumar said.

Midhani has expertise of wired drawing at the level of 1mm or 1.2mm but for the requirement sought, it was a challenge and that was to provide 1/10th of the thickness it had made for an earlier use. “We then fixed the parameters and optimised it. That is the skill Midhani has where requirements can be delivered even in short notice. Defence requirements are unique and urgent,” Sanjay Kumar said.

147,['27/09/2020'],"After wait of over 40 years, 3 campuses of IMA to be linked with underpass tunnels; defence minister to initiate project on Monday","Dehradun: Fulfilling a long-pending demand to link the North, Central and South campuses of the Indian Military Academy ( IMA ), defence minister Rajnath Singh will lay the foundation stone of the project through a virtual ceremony on Monday. The underpass tunnels, worth around Rs 45 crore, will facilitate smooth movement of academy staff and cadets from one campus to another.

The demand to link the campuses, sources in the IMA said, is over four decades old and a project to undertake the same was also conceived in 1978 but did not see the light of the day. Presently, academy members have to cross the National Highway-72 to move between campuses and this, officials said, not only inconveniences academy personnel but also impedes traffic on the highway.

Taking cognisance of the issue, Singh had announced construction of the underpasses when he came to review the IMA Passing Out Parade (POP) in December 2019.

An official from IMA said that the project, estimated to cost Rs 45 crore, is likely to be completed in two years’ time. “The underpasses will provide a major relief to the heavy traffic flow on the busy highway and also enhance training efficiency and security of Gentlemen Cadets and IMA personnel as they will not be required to cross the highway to access training facilities distributed across the three campuses,” the official added.

The underpasses will also benefit local residents as public movement is restricted for a couple of days on the stretch of the highway near IMA during the POP and other major events happening at the IMA.

A communique from the IMA said that the e-inauguration of the event will be witnessed via video conferencing from New Delhi by Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat and Chief of Army Staff, General MM Naravane while the GOC-in-C Army Training Command, Lieutenant General Raj Shukla will join from Shimla. The event will also be attended by CM Trivendra Singh Rawat.

Speaking about the project, CM Rawat said, “The underpasses are extremely important from the point of view of the Passing Out Parade and the security concerns. Therefore, when the defence minister was in Dehradun , we had made a request for the two underpasses and I happy that he gave his consent and the project is now taking off.”

Those who specialise in singing SPB’s songs say it was by singing his songs that they found both identity as an artist and a means to sustain their families.

“I was born in a poor household. Today, I’m married and settled. My kids go to school. I could afford all this mainly because of the income I get by singing SPB sir’s songs on stage,” says R Pradeep, choked with emotion. “Music lovers recognise me by my first name, all because of SPB sir’s songs,” says the singer, who has been performing for the last 25 years.

M Ram, who has been performing SPB’s songs for two decades, agrees. “It’s not an exaggeration to say our livelihoods are based on SPB sir’s voice.”

Though untrained, the flair with which SPB traversed genres including classical, motivated them to become singers, the singers say.

While large audiences expect peppy and quick numbers, they made an exception for SPB, says Pradeep. “We would be singing fast-paced songs and there would be a request to sing the melodious ‘ Kaadhalin Deepam Ondru ’. When we start the song’s humming prelude, the trickle of clapping would give way to roaring applause.”

While audience often request SPB’s soothing numbers such as ‘ Kamban Emandhaan ’, ‘Vaan Nila Nila Alla’ and ‘Ilaya Nila Pozhigirathe’, he was versatile in all genres and brought out emotions such as valour and pathos, the singers say. Speaking of the Coimbatore’s love for the legend, the singers recall an event held here last year, where SPB shared the stage with composer Ilayaraja. “The three-hour show went on for five-hours due to audience’s requests and enthusiasm,” says Ram.

N Rajan, who runs Raj Melodies, a music troupe in the city, says the band members worked with SPB to conduct programmes across the state. “He encouraged all singers and musicians. He was never late for rehearsal. He always sang his songs in the same scale they were first recorded.”

On Saturday, 30 singers came together at Rajan’s studio to pay tributes to SPB. They performed his pathos-filled numbers such as ‘Unna Nenachen Paattu Padichen’, ‘Paadi Parandha Kili’, ‘Kaadhal Rojave’ and ‘Nilave Va’, for one-and-half-hour.

151,['27/09/2020'],"Beach cleanliness drive on, but without bins","COLVA: Earlier this month, a tourist walking down Benaulim beach stopped and stared at the number of plastic water bottles strewn all over the place, he then began collecting them. He looked around but saw no garbage bins. He then kept the waste on the beach but out of the reach of the waves, shook his head and continued his morning walk.

While the the tourism department has put up banners on the beach announcing a cleanliness fortnight, ‘Swachhta Pakhwada’, from September 16 to 30, a large number of garbage bins imprinted with the logo of the beach cleaning agency, Karnataka Commercial and Industrial Corporation (KCIC), are lying dumped behind the lifeguard tower at Benaulim.

“The tourism department banner not only contradicts the ground reality, it exposes their lackadaisical attitude. For one, from Benaulim to Colva, no bins are placed on the beach. Secondly, the beach cleaning agency KCIC itself has dumped garbage among the vegetation, and, thirdly, The tourism department is a silent spectator,” said Rudolf Baretto, a social activist from Benaulim.

Pascoal Fernandes, a fisherman, said that officials from the tourism department should have first visited the beach to check the conditions, got the KCIC to first place the bins on the beach and then put up banners.

When contacted, tourism director Menino D’Souza told TOI that “because of rains the bins were pulled up, but if the water has receded we will ask them to put them back”. “I have now deployed my supervisors on the beach, but they don’t reach everywhere,” said D’Souza, while adding that he has started taking attendance of supervisors on beach duties.

A large number of tourists flock to the beaches every day, some private shacks have started operations, traditional fishermen—ramponnkars—are busy with their fishing season, the sea continues to cleanse itself by washing ashore huge amounts of garbage, and while all this happens and a lot of dry waste, including glass bottles, is generated, garbage bins are yet to be placed on the beaches.

152,['27/09/2020'],BJP issues notice to Lohaghat MLA for misbehaviour,"Dehradun: State president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Bansidhar Bhagat on Saturday issued a notice to the party’s MLA from Lohaghat constituency, Pooran Singh Fartyal, for “misbehaviour and putting the party in utter embarrassment during the recent assembly session”.

During the session, Fartyal had accused his own party’s government of corruption in the tender for the Tanakpur-Jauljibi road, which is a road of strategic importance being constructed near the Nepal border. Besides raising the matter in the assembly, it was alleged that Fartyal had also taken the matter to the party’s central leadership in Delhi without informing the state-level leaders.

Terming it an “act of gross misbehaviour”, Bhagat said, “The kind of words the MLA had used for the government of his own party, both inside and outside the assembly, is very regrettable. We have sought a reply from him in a week’s time after which further course of action will be decided.”

The notice issued to the MLA mentions sections 25D and 25F of the party's constitution under which he has been warned of disciplinary action.

Meanwhile, speaking on the issue of the recently-tabled agriculture bills and nationwide resentment against the same, Bhagat said that “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always worked in the interest of farmers and the opposition just cannot digest it.”

The BJP state president also added that the party members will go door to door to publicise the agriculture bills. “Not just verbal communication but written material will also be shared with farmers to make them aware that the bill is for their own good,” Bhagat added.

153,['27/09/2020'],Interim development order not to be applied uniformly,"Thiruvananthapuram: With the draft master plan for 2040 not likely to be finalized soon, constructions in the city will be governed by different regulations in respective wards.

The town planning department (TPD) is learnt to have proposed sanctioned master plan (SMP) in old wards, sanctioned area specific master plans in selected wards and detailed town planning schemes wherever applicable.

As for remaining wards, interim development order (IDO) will be in effect. This has put to rest a long debate over whether IDO can replace SMP and can be uniformly applied across all wards in the city.

TPD has made some revisions regarding coverage, floor area ratio (FAR), dimension of constructions in IDO to make the norms more flexible.

In March, the city corporation council had decided to ask for a formal clarification from the state government on what should be followed in the city.

Local self-government (LSG) minister A C Moideen had held two meetings in December 2019 regarding renewal of permit for one building and allocation of permit for another apartment project after officials denied sanction for the projects citing that the sites came under green strip as per SMP 1971. This led to a debate on which has to be followed in the city.

TPD has now incorporated a provision by which separate norms will prevail over different wards until a new master plan is notified and published in the city.

As per the changes introduced in IDO, private properties mistakenly included in areas for public and semi-public use or as paddy land can be verified using revenue records and conversion is possible with the concurrence of town planner.

The dimension of commercial constructions in residential zones has also been revised depending up access of road.

The provision of having 50% coverage for residential buildings up to 300 sq m in dry agricultural zones has been taken away and in green to planned coverage zones, the coverage limit fixed at 33.3% has been done away with. The building rules will determine coverage in these areas.

IDO had proposed FAR of two and road width of 12m for large-scale development projects. The new proposal has taken away the condition of FAR and will be allowed as per building rules which means more FAR will be permitted for large-scale development projects.

Town planning standing committee chairman Palayam Rajan said relaxations would be introduced in IDO to make it more flexible and to address concerns of the public.

The corporation is expected to pass a resolution based on revision of IDO norms soon. .

155,['27/09/2020'],"Private labs flout ICMR diktat, seek prescription for testing","Coimbatore: Nearly 20 days after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said medical prescription wasn’t required to get Covid-19 testing done, many private laboratories in the city are yet to comply with the new directions and they continue to turn away people without a doctor’s prescription.

Jagadish*, 38, who tested positive for the virus more than 10 days ago, was turned away by three private laboratories on Cowley Brown Road on Saturday, when he approached them for testing to know if he was still infected. All of them demanded a doctor’s prescription with a seal. He finally contacted government authorities, who finally referred him to a private lab on Puliyakulam Road.

There are many people who had a similar experience. Vishwa C*, a writer, said, “Despite having flu-like symptoms, a laboratory turned me away when I approached it for Covid-19 testing, demanding a prescription. Since I didn’t want to unnecessarily expose myself to other patients at a clinic, I just isolated myself at home for a week, before returning to work.”

This has to be read with the district’s Covid-19 curve, which is on the ascent, leaving the public health department perplexed. Health officials seem to be wondering how to control the spread.

ICMR had allowed people to get tested without a prescription as early diagnosis would help prevent them from infecting others.

In fact, not allowing people to get tested at the onset of symptoms or immediately after coming in contact with a positive patient was attributed as one of the reasons for the rapid spread of the virus in the state.

District collector K Rajamani said, “We agree that when laboratories turn people away, they get too demotivated to approach a doctor for a prescription and go back to the lab to get tested.”

A health department official, however, said such a scenario was more likely only with youngsters that too when symptoms are so mild. “Tiredness might be their primary symptom. But they could still end up infecting other family members and neighbours.”

Pointing out a patient was most likely to infect others in the pre-symptomatic stage or in the initial five to six symptomatic days, K Kolandasamy, former director of public health, said, “So, if people want to get tested and isolate themselves as soon as possible to protect others around them, it should be encouraged.”

The collector, meanwhile, said he would warn the private laboratories not to turn away people approaching them for Covid-19 testing, demanding a doctor’s prescription.

It will be the first enumeration of the endangered primate in ATR, an official said. “The number of the species has drastically declined. It is essential that the population dynamics and breeding potential are recorded on a regular and long-term basis.”

Volunteers of Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF), a non-governmental organization that has been studying about the monkeys at Pudhuthottam in Valparai, will help the department in the drive, the official told TOI. “As the region is receiving heavy rain, it will be difficult to spot the animals. We have decided to do the enumeration in the first week of October as rainfall is expected to reduce within a week. NCF volunteers will help forest staff to conduct the three-day drive.”

The department has identified 15 forest beats in the Pollachi division for the survey. “Home range of a lion-tailed macaque is four to five square kilometres. They move in groups led by a male. As many as 40 grids – each with an area of four-square kilometres – will be sampled for the survey and each group that passes through the grids will be recorded. We will also record details like number of animals in the groups, adults, sub-adults and juveniles along with their sex.”

The monkeys were generally shy, the official said. “Of late, they have started to come out of the forest and were spotted on roads in Valparai. Human-lion-tailed macaque conflict is increasing in the region. Using the census data, we will take measures to protect the species,” he said.

Jail authorities have confirmed that the prisoners are being trained in various aspects of farming in the 120-acre prisoners’ agricultural colony so that they can lead a bright life beyond the barriers of the jail.In a far-reaching initiative to prepare them as farmers once the prisoners are released from the jail, authorities of the prisons department are also focusing on equipping them with modern techniques of farming.Technically speaking, a life term is to be read as a person spending the rest of his life in jail. But, governments make considerations for premature release of prisoners who complete 14 years of their sentence in the jail. Prisoners with good behaviour and those showing enterprise after completing a certain number of years are given an option by the prisons department to be placed in the open air jail. The Cherlapally open air jail has an entrance and does not have a fencing as prisoners, who are due for release in near future, do not try to run away.“They are learning a lot about modern agricultural practices,” superintendent of the jail Dasaradha Ram Reddy told TOI. They are also taught about the multi-layer farming concept on cultivating three or four crops simultaneously. “This can be done in less than one acre of land or a limited space,” explained jailor Ashok Kumar. Officials from Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University are providing technical knowhow and inputs to the jail inmates.As part of integrated farming, ponds have been created in the jail. The prisoners are also taught aquaculture, dairy farming, breeding poultry and making vermicompost. In poultry, the focus is on breeding country birds. The ‘Mysurue natu’ and ‘Aseel natu’ poultry varieties fetch good returns as they are sold at Rs 400 per kg and the birds can be harvested in less than six months. “If 500 birds are reared, the prisoners can earn between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 3 lakh,” a prison official explained.In six beds of 60x4 sq ft, vermicompost is made inside the prison premises by sourcing cow dung from the nearby dairy farm. African red wiggler worms are part of the vermicompost to make it a solid combination. Every prisoner gets to learn all this, while others work at the petrol bunk attached to the prison.According to the authorities, those who are released can lead a normal life by earning their own livelihood. “If they seek, loans can also be facilitated for them,” officials added.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78343745,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-216202,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jailbirds-script-a-new-survival-story-turn-to-farming-for-a-better-future/articleshow/78341588.cms

164,['27/09/2020'],Paddy procurement in Punjab &amp; Haryana to begin a few days early,"The Centre has asked states to kick off the exercise from today instead of the usual timetable of October 1

NEW DELHI: Amid political attacks over the farm sector bills, the Centre has decided to advance paddy procurement in Punjab and Haryana by a few days with the exercise slated to kick off on Sunday, instead of the usual timetable, starting October 1.

In a letter to the state governments, the consumer affairs and food ministry has said that the kharif procurement has been advanced due to early arrival of paddy this season but officials conceded that this was a political decision.

Typically, October and November are the main procurement months in Punjab and Haryana with Karnataka and Tripura seeing purchases start in December. In states such as West Bengal procurement will end next June.

After the passage of the bill to ease restrictions on sale in mandis, Opposition parties had said that the move would put farmers, especially in the two states, at a disadvantage, first prompting the Narendra Modi government to quickly announce the minimum support price and follow it up by advancing government purchase by a few days in a bid to assure farmers that the scheme will not be tinkered with.

The Centre is estimating an 18% jump in procurement of paddy this season to 49.5 million tonnes compared to around 42 million tonnes last year. Of this nearly 22% or 11.3 million tonnes is estimated to come from Punjab, while Haryana may chip in with around 4.5 million tonnes. Chhattisgarh with 6 million tonnes and Telangana (5 million tonnes), will be second and third largest sources for paddy procurement.

Data available with the ministry showed that till Friday around eight lakh tonnes of paddy have already reached mandis in Haryana, although data for Punjab is currently unavailable. Early monsoon rains this year are seen to be one of the reasons behind early arrivals with a bumper harvest predicted by the authorities.

Moreover, another 81 patients died within two days of admission and 74 died within three days.

They also lack of awareness. All this causes unnecessary time wastage in the initial phase of the infection.Deputy dean Kailash Zine, who is also the head of the forensic medicine and toxicology department, said, “Factors like people failing to accept that they could be infected, fear of the disease and lack of awareness are some of the reasons for patients reaching the hospitals late.”Health authorities said in most cases, a patient is brought to the hospital only after his/her condition deteriorates.

The minister took a serious cognizance of some people’s representatives raising the issues faced by the farmers due to non-cooperation from insurance companies. He warned of action against anyone adding to the worries of farmers. The minister even reviewed the situation of the latest lumpy disease that has already infected thousands of cattle in the region alone.

During the meeting held at Aurangabad, Bhuse has ordered for carrying immediate panchanamas of the damaged crops, strict implementation of Mahatma Phule farm loan waiver scheme that has been introduced by Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state. He also directed the officials concerned to ensure that the vegetable supply chain of the farmers does not get affected amid pandemic clubbed with excess rainfall.

In a dramatic turn of events, the local police later arrested her husband, Asif, who had brought her to the district hospital where she was declared dead and also reached the thana to lodge a complaint against her estranged cousin.

Neha had married Asif, a resident of Sheikhupura locality, in 2019 against her family’s wishes. The couple, who had known each other for a few years, later moved to Delhi where Asif used to work as a carpenter until the lockdown rendered him jobless. They had come back to Budaun, forced by Asif's loss of job in Delhi due to the lockdown, only on Friday. She was shot dead later that night.

When Asif reached the police station to lodge a complaint against his wife's cousin and claimed that the latter had threatened them, police detained the suspect instead. In the next few hours, police claimed that Asif had confessed to the murder during interrogation and booked him under section 302 (murder) on a complaint filed by Neha’s cousin Ashish.

Buduan superintendent of police Sankalp Sharma told TOI, “We had detained Neha’s cousin after recording the statement of Asif but later we didn’t find any proof of his involvement. On the other hand, when we cross-questioned Asif about the incident, he broke down and accepted that he had killed Neha with the help of his friend.”

Neha’s family refused to accept her body. They said she had “died for them the day she married a person outside the community”.

AURANGABAD: The local crime branch (LCB) of the Jalna police on Saturday afternoon raided eight different lottery centres in the prime market areas of the town, and busted a major racket involved in running unregistered lottery ticket centres.

A preliminary probe has revealed that the suspects were neither registered with a competent office nor had they registered for GST. They were issuing locally prepared lottery tickets. Police teams have seized several computers, dongles, printers from each of these illegal lottery centres, collectively worth Rs 5 lakh. The suspects have been booked for cheating and under Maharashtra Prevention of Gambling Act.

Sanjay Pariwale, the 39-year-old mastermind of the racket and a resident of Kadbi Mandi area, and seven others were operating the centres at Tanga Stand, Ramnagar, Mutha Building at Subhash Chowk, Central Bus Stand area, Garib Shah Bazaar and Kadbi Mandi.

LCB inspector Rajendersingh Gaur said the suspects not only duped the customers but also evaded GST. The other accused have been identified as Santosh Pariwale (32), Satish Pariwale (35), Jagdish Tiwari (44), Sachin Namde (27), Satish Sale (32), Krushna Chavan (30) and Gagan Devawale (25). The simultaneous raids at all the spots were personally monitored by the newly appointed superintendent of police Vinayak Deshmukh and were led by probationary IPS Hasan Gauhar.

Police said the suspects were using a software that showed the lottery operators the load on numbers mentioned on the tickets. To make maximum money, the suspects would select the number with the least bet, and allot money to it.

The probe also found that to attract customers, the racketeers initially gave out many prizes. “The suspects had obtained just a shop act license for each of their centres and would fool the people by claiming that they are registered with the state government,” said an officer privy to the probe.

Guidelines issued by the state task force should be followed by the medical fraternity,” Tope told TOI.The state health minister said that while the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has allowed Indian companies to manufacture and distribute remdesivir, the drug should not be used for every “walk-in patient”.The circular, a copy of which is with TOI, also includes guidelines on use of steroids. “It is the duty of local authorities to ensure these guidelines are followed by the medical fraternity within their districts,” the minister said.Besides these orders, a special campaign will be launched against the black marketing of remdesivir in the state, Tope said, while adding that there is currently no shortage of the drug in Maharashtra.He said the Food and Drug Administration will ensure strict monitoring of the supply coming into the districts. All prescriptions will also be logged into a system to keep up checks and balances.“The FDA has to set up a strict monitoring system. Those found involved in black marketing should be strictly penalised. Every remdesivir injection that reaches the local authority or distributor should be tracked by the regulators and if there is malpractice, the distributor will also be penalised,” the minister said.On reports of shortage, Tope said a few days ago, there was a problem with the remdesivir stock supplied by one pharma firm which had resulted in supply delays.But he said everything was now “under control”.Subhash Salunke, the state's technical advisor on Covid-19 and a public health expert, said the experimental drug’s use during Covid-19 has to be monitored.“It is a drug that needs to be respected and used under expert supervision.

Before the stone laying, an aerial survey of Tinkar village of Nepal’s Darchula district was also conducted by Thapa. The minister also spent a night in Chhangru. He was accompanied by Army personnel and APF officials, as per sources.

On Saturday, the minister held a press conference in Nepal’s Darchula district. Speaking to mediapersons, he said, “The government is committed to the development of border areas and local youths here would be provided with employment opportunities. We will work for the development of the strategically crucial region and develop it as a trade and tourism hotspot.”

During the event, Thapa is believed to have told mediapersons that a multi-utility building will be constructed in the area at an estimated cost of Rs 10 crore within one year. He added that a permanent structure for Border Observation Posts (BOPs) will also be made in Chhangru.

Nepal has already constructed several BOPs on its side of the border at Darchula, Jauljibi, Lali, Jhulaghat, and Pancheshwar regions after border tensions flared up between India and Nepal in May when defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the 80-km-long Ghatiabagarh-Lipulekh road. The Nepalese government had claimed that the road runs through its territory. Subsequently, the Nepalese parliament had also released a map which showed Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh as part of its territory.

173,['27/09/2020'],City airport finds it hard to harness solar energy,"Chennai: Chennai airport lags behind in harnessing solar energy while smaller airports have installed more generating capacity in the past few years. The city airport does not have adequate land to install solar panels to lean more on clean energy.

The airport now has capacity to generate 1.6MWp (mega watt peak) solar power from rooftop panels, while smaller airports in Chandigarh and Jaipur have more installed capacity, shows statistics presented by aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri in the Lok Sabha. Chandigarh has 3MWp capacity from ground-mounted panels while Jaipur has 1.9MWp capacity, 1.8MWp of which is from ground-mounted panels. Trichy , also smaller, generates 1.1MWp — 1MWp from ground-mounted panels.

Kolkata tops AAI-run airports in harnessing solar power, with 17MWp.

Lack of land and use of land to develop ground facilities for flights fearing a second airport will be delayed, have caused the airport to slow down on solar power generation. Nevertheless, the airport is planning to step up generation so that dependence on the grid could be reduced.

“There is a proposal to install panels on the ground for generating 6.5MWp. Land was identified in seven pockets. But some of these are close to the runway and doubts were raised whether glare from the panels will affect flights. It is still under discussion,” said an official. A huge chunk of the identified land is in the northern corner of the main runway close to the Pallavaram side. A contractor was also selected in May last year.

The current installed capacity of 1.6MWp helps the airport save around Rs 2 crore every year, the official added. “Less land is available in Chennai airport. This is a reason why panels could not be installed on the ground,” he added.

Most of the airports which have a higher generating capacity have panels installed on the ground. AAI also has been pushing for solar power at smaller airports which have less traffic but more space. This is the reason airports such as Madurai (0.9MWp), Trichy (1.1MWp), Vijayawada (1MWp), Tirupati (1MWp) have installed solar power capacity.

As an alternative, AAI has brought in third party power purchase, from Karur, to increase use of solar power in Chennai airport. However, private airports have made better progress in increasing solar power generation.

At the time of registration of flats, LDA took Rs 10,000-12,000 from each allottee as part of corpus funds. The amount is kept by the authority till the time RWAs are formed. After that, LDA hands over the responsibility of maintenance to its welfare association along with the fund.

In 2017, LDA handed over the responsibility of maintenance work in eight apartments in Gomtinagar and Gomtinagar Extension — Ganga, Yamuna, Sunrise, Kalptaru, Sargam, Kaveri, Greenwood and Alaknanda — to RWAs. However, the Rs 9-crore corpus has not been released till date. As a result, RWAs are unable to carry out maintenance of lifts, boundary walls, fire safety equipment and CCTVs.

Gomtinagar Vistaar Jankalyaan Mahasamiti, a parent body of these RWAs, is planning to protest outside LDA office in Gomtinagar.

Its president KK Singh said, “LDA is turning a deaf ear to our demands. We are not asking LDA to carry out the maintenance work from its budget, but from the corpus created by the money deposited by the allottees.”

LDA vice-chairman S K Dwivedi said, “About 50% of the corpus fund will be released soon. We won’t be able to release the entire amount due to financial crisis.”

The accused was identified as Vishnu Choudhary, 23. They were known to each other.Vishnu was arrested by cops who are interrogating him.Rahul Jain, DCP, Jaipur East told TOI, “At around 10.15am on Saturday, the accused reached the victim’s college and first stabbed her in the neck and then shot her.

Although she was rushed to the hospital, she died in the trauma centre while undergoing treatment.”The accused did not have his own mode of transport and after initial hesitation fled from the crime spot but was chased and nabbed by a cop who followed him by hitching ride in civilian vehicles.

CHENNAI: The Union government has informed the Madras high court that only 25.9% of schools in Tamil Nadu have ‘children with special needs-friendly toilets ’ and only 62.9% of schools have been provided with ‘ramps and made barrier-free’.

“As per unified district information system for education (UDISE+) (2018-19) 37,183 schools in Tamil Nadu have been provided with ramps. Besides 59,152 schools (all management) schools in the state have children with special needs (CWSN) friendly toilets…,” the department of school education under the Union ministry of education has said.

The department’s under secretary, Alok Jawahar, made the submissions in a counter-affidavit he had filed in response to a public interest writ petition seeking adequate infrastructure for the children in schools.

As to the relief sought in the PIL to provide safe transportation facilities for children with disabilities, the department said, “The Central RTE Rules provide for appropriate and safe transportation arrangements to enable them to attend school and complete elementary education.”

“Under the inclusive education for CWSN component of Samagra Shiksha, for access to and from school and to facilitate retention of CWSN enrolled in general schools, there is a provision of transportation and escort allowances for such children from Class I to XII.

For 2020-21, Rs 1498.1 lakh has been estimated for the transportation allowance for 45,002 CWSN and Rs 369.4 lakh has been estimated for escort allowance for 9,996 CWSN for Tamil Nadu,” the affidavit said.

This apart, to help visually impaired students, the department said, “Till date 4,24,285 teachers have been trained and oriented to the needs of children with blindness, sign, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, learning disabilities, multiple disabilities and autism.”

The report added that the new NEP (National Education Policy) 2020 lays particular emphasis on the development of the creative potential of each individual.

“It is based on the principle that education must develop not only cognitive capacities — both the foundational capacities, of literacy and numeracy and higher-order cognitive capacities, such as critical thinking and problem solving — but also social, ethical, and emotional capacities and dispositions that echo teachings of J Krisnamurti (writer and speaker).”

People residing on the banks of these rivers have been urged to contact the authorities concerned and learn all details about the time-to-time release of water from these dams.

Rajendra Kale, superintending engineer of the Command Area Development Authority (CADA) that looks after the Jayakwadi and other dams, said that people are expected to be on high alert during the ongoing monsoon phase though the flood situation across the region is under control.

He said that the CADA has set up a control room to keep in touch with the villagers as the water level of rivers could rise any time due to the continuous incessant rainfall. Kale said that the upstream dams of Jayakwadi are filled to the brim, eventually causing release of water in to the Jayakwadi dam, thus filling it to its full capacity.

According to Kale, Jayakwadi, Yeldari, Majalgaon and Nimn-Dudhana dams are filled to their 100% capacity.

The arrested people were identified as A Nagaraj, 23 and B Sivan, 22, both from Erumadu at Pandalur in the Nilgiris. “They broke into the house of Prabhu, took a steel bureau to the entrance of the house and broke it open using boulders to steal 12 sovereigns of gold ornaments,” a police officer said. “The duo had targeted the houses of Karthi and Kannan in the area, but could not succeed after the inmates woke up and raised an alarm.”

Police recovered 10 sovereigns of gold ornaments from the burglars.

The duo told police that they used to stay at isolated places along the railway track and selected isolated houses for burglary.

They are part of a bigger burglary gang, the officer said. “Last month, the city police had detained B Veeramani, 38, of Pandalur in Nilgiris district, a member of the gang. We are on the lookout for four more people. The gang members used to wear briefs and cover their face using clothes while conducting burglary.”

This, they said, happened as the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) failed to provide them ambulance or assistance in other issues.In many cases, the patients waited for help from NMC officials who couldn’t make it to their homes. The helpline numbers for ambulance too didn’t work.A banker from Manewada had to drive his wife in his car to a private hospital after she complained of breathlessness. The banker’s one son was negative while three of them in the family were positive.“I had no option but to take her to the hospital. I deposited all the money and returned. The NMC officials called and asked to inform them, if needed. Later, none of the helpline numbers worked when my wife needed help. Our son who tested negative had to stay with us as even the relatives were not willing to keep him,” said the banker.In another case from Friends Colony, a man had to ask his friend to bring an oxygen cylinder to his home as the former’s mother was feeling breathless. “The friend too was unwell. Yet, I sought his help as my mother’s condition was deteriorating,” he said.A woman from Jafar Nagar too posted a message on social media seeking help as her husband, in-laws and kids were positive and they were unable to find beds.Civic officials admitted that they were overworked to reach out to each positive person. It is not possible to provide any assistance other than medical support which too we are finding it difficult, they said.The civic officials said a couple of NGOs are working to help distressed people.

CHENNAI: In a setback to local administration minister S P Velumani , the Madras high court has said it would decide if there is a need to order a fresh preliminary inquiry by an independent agency into the graft complaints filed by Arrapor Iyakkam and the DMK against him, in relation to allotting tenders of Chennai and Coimbatore corporations.

“Upon hearing counsel, we would like to get enlightened on an issue of importance, which is the nature of the order that can be passed by this court in the event of the report (preliminary inquiry report) being found not satisfactory,” said a division bench of Justice M M Sundresh and Justice R Hemalatha.

The court has already refused to accept a DVAC report filed after a preliminary inquiry, that concluded that prima facie no case has been made out against the minister. The pleas, heard at length by a bench headed by Justice M Sathaynarayanan, were later posted before the present bench.

Citing the NGO’s submission the court had power under article 226 of the Constitution to direct DVAC to register FIR and thereafter, to pass consequential orders for the investigation by an independent agency, the judge said, “We feel that an issue might arise as to a fresh preliminary inquiry to be conducted by a different investigating agency.”

“If that is the case, especially when this court finds that the report filed is not satisfactory either on fact or on law, can the very complaint made by the petitioner itself be referred to an independent agency?” the court wondered. In such a case, is that agency required to be arrayed as a party respondent in the proceedings or not, the judges asked.

As counsel for the petitioners sought a small accommodation to address these two issues along with the other issues already raised both by the petitioners and the court, the bench adjourned the hearing September 28.

187,['27/09/2020'],Nashik city’s 90% recovery rate boosts bed availability,"Nashik: The healthy Covid-19 recovery rate of 90% in the city has ensured that there are more Covid available in many hospitals.

There are 83 hospitals in the city, including around 73 private ones, which are involved in treating Covid-19 patients. There are more than 4,200 beds reserved for Covid patients in all the 83 hospitals. As on Friday, 1,890 of those beds were vacant.

“Of late, there has been an increase in the number of vacant beds in private hospitals in the city by 10-15%. We are hopeful that there would be a further rise in the number of vacant beds, including oxygen and ICU beds, unless there is a sudden spike in cases again,” senior NMC health officials told TOI.

Civic officials said the NMC’s centralized Covid bed management cell, which oversees and controls bed distribution for patients, has been getting calls from many private hospitals requesting patients be sent to their facilities as they have vacant beds. However, in some of the top private hospitals, beds, especially ICU and ventilator ones, remain occupied as there is a huge demand to get patients treated in these hospitals.

“The NMC has been aggressively carrying out contact tracing, which is more than 30 per positive patient. This has helped in the early identification and treatment of Covid patients and has aided the recovery rate in reaching 90%. On Friday, there were 4,016 active cases,” said the officials.

The officials have made it clear that despite the increasing number of vacant beds, the civic body would still go ahead and continue to add more beds, especially oxygen and ICU beds, to stay prepared to deal with a sudden spike in cases.

“We are carrying out the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ initiative. There is a likelihood of more positive cases being identified,” added the civic officials.

Sameer Chandrate, the president of the Nashik unit of Indian Medical Association, also said that the increasing number of beds are vacant in the city hospitals as the recovery rate is improving. “In the entire state, Nashik city has one of the highest number of private hospitals involved in treating Covid-19 patients. The doctors and nurses have been working overtime, which has helped achieve an impressive recovery rate. Their contribution must not be undermined,” said Chandratre.

PUNE: The state government is all set to scale up Covid-19 testing by three times by the end of this month.

State health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI on Saturday that the Centre has directed Maharashtra to increase both testing and tracing of high and low-risk contacts.

Maharashtra is currently carrying out at 46,322 tests per million, compared to the country's average of 48,360.

“We have been directed by the Prime Minister to increase our testing. And we said we would scale it up three times as we continue to ease restrictions,” Tope said.

The Prime Minister had called for a virtual meeting with top officials from seven states with the highest Covid case loads: Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Punjab.

These states have accounted for 63% of all cases and 77% of deaths so far. The positivity rate in these states too is much higher than the national average of 8.5%.

Following a representation made by the farmers , at a meeting held by chief minister Pramod Sawant with sugarcane growers, in the presence of agriculture minister Chandrakant Kavalekar, Sawant announced that Goa’s only sugar factory at Dayanand Nagar-Dharbandora, Sanjivani Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana, would not be shut down.

Harshad Prabhudesai, vice-president of the Sugarcane Growers Association Goa, said that they are satisfied with the chief minister’s statement that cane growers will continue to be compensated for their standing crop until the factory restarts operations.

The 47-year-old factory has been in a dilapidated state and in need of urgent overhauling of vital machines.

“Every year, the maintenance work would normally begin immediately after Ganesh Chaturthi. Howerer, since no work had yet commenced to overhaul the machinery, the farmers were confused whether the factory would start or not during the upcoming crushing season, which usually commences by November,” Francis Mascarenhas, a cane grower from Sanguem, told TOI.

Disappointed by the government’s procrastination over the future of sugar factory, the sugarcane growers had threatened to stage a sit-in agitation in front of the factory on September 29 if the government failed to take a decision by September 25.

It may be recalled that during the last crushing season, government did not run the factory but procured canes from local farmers and sent them to two factories in Karnataka and Maharashtra.

The ASHAs have now threatened to stop the survey if the administration fails to provide them with protective gear.

Currently, the ASHAs, called the foot-soldiers of the healthcare system, are undertaking a survey under the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign launched by the state government. They are assisted by the Anganwadi workers and local health staff.

Netradipa Patil, the president of ASHA’s district association, said: “We have threatened to stop the survey work. During the past surveys, around 40 Ashas had contracted the infection. We are the most neglected personnel of the healthcare system. The administration has not provided us protective gear as was assured in the notification of the campaign. We are assigned duties at any time. The pulse oximeters and thermal scanners are of poor quality and the administration still expects us to find the suspected patients. How we are supposed to do that?”.

The first phase of the survey is going to end on October 10. Several activists are also doubting the outcome of the survey given that the surveyors are provided with the faulty equipment. Patil said, “We have been asked to refer the suspected patients to the nearby fever clinics. How will we do that if we are not able to identify them? We know the importance of the survey, however, we are not sure about its efficacy and how the data generated is going to be utilised.”

The ASHAs claim that they have not provided with gloves, face shields and masks. Also they are not given the stationery items such as stickers, markers for marking the houses of the suspected patients.

193,['27/09/2020'],MGNREGS: 58 lakh Tamil Nadu families sought jobs in the past 6 months,"The surge was noticed after the resumption of work in May. (File photo)

Chennai: After a lull following the Covid-19 outbreak, the demand-driven employment programme Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), has come as a succour to rural families.

The latest data provided by the Tamil Nadu Rural Development Department shows 57.9 lakh households demanded jobs in the past six months. The government has provided jobs to 66.6 lakh people and person days generated under the scheme have shot up to 15.15 crore.

The surge was noticed after the resumption of work in May. It was suspended for a month-and-a-half in April and May due to lockdown. Every worker under the 100-day employment guarantee scheme in the state was paid wages of Rs 256 a day since April. “There is also a great demand for new job cards from adults of registered households, as well as from migrant workers from states such as Maharashtra. In all, TN distributed new job cards to 8.4 lakh workers since the lockdown was announced in March,” said a senior government official. Much of the migrant workforce from districts such as Chengalpet, Tiruvannamalai and Kallakurichi, have returned from Chennai.

Similarly, 1.8 lakh job seekers from registered households in Dharmapuri have received new cards, followed by Madurai (35,009), Thanjavur (34,416), and Pudukottai (32,291). Rural development minister Narendra Singh Tomar reiterated in the Parliament that every adult in a household in the rural areas with a job card is eligible for a job under the scheme. There is no provision to register a job card holder categorized as migrant worker/family under the scheme.

“Given the water deficiency in the state, the department has been focusing on construction of soak pit, water absorption trench cutting and desilting of water bodies, besides tree plantation,” the official said. In order to meet additional demand for work due to return of workers from urban areas to rural areas, the Centre has made an additional provision of Rs 40,000 crore under MGNREGS under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat package, from the budgeted estimate of Rs 61,500 crore.

AYODHYA: While Ayodhya was catapulted to the Guinness book after 5lakh diyas were lit on the Saryu banks last year, the pandemic shadow has forced the district administration this year to plan a ‘virtual deepotsav’, riding on 3D technology to keep afloat the grand tradition launched by the chief minister in 2017.

However, Dussehra festivities in October may be a dampener with the administration denying permission to restart Ram Lilas in the open, despite fresh guidelines allowing 100 people to congregate for religious functions.

On Diwali night, while select volunteers would physically light diyas on Saryu banks in strict adherence to Covid protocols, a mammoth 3D virtual platform will be created for every citizen to illuminate the banks by a simple swipe on their mobiles from the comfort of their homes.

Speaking to TOI, director, Ayodhya Shodh Sansthan, Y P Singh, said, “A link will be sent to mobile phones of every resident, who can click on an icon and a diya will be lit virtually. A certificate from the government will immediately flash on their mobiles.” However, ambitious plans to rope in celebs and cine stars for the Ayodhya Deepotsav ceremony have been currently put on hold, he said.

""We will motivate managements of over 200 temples to light diyas on their campus and atop roofs. And 3,000 security personnel deployed at Ramjanmabhoomi will be asked to light diyas in the premises,” he said.

UP minister for tourism and culture, Nilkanth Tiwari, issued detailed instructions to the district administration on Deepotsav celebrations during his visit to Ayodhya late Friday. During a review meeting, he said, “A new record of lighting diyas would be created and the tradition begun by the chief minister will continue while following Covid norms.”

A virtual platform would be developed from Saryu banks to Ram Katha Park and only volunteers will be allowed to light lamps. “While crowds will be prohibited on the banks, residents can connect virtually by lighting diyas from their homes,” he said. The fine print on ‘virtual deepotsav’ will be out soon, he said.

However, the non-stop Ram Lila in the Ayodhya museum premises will remain suspended, said, officials of Ayodhya Shodh Sansthan, a government department that has been organising the performance since May 3, 2017.

Talking to TOI, Ram Teerath, manager, Ayodhya Shodh Sansthan, said, “At least 300 Ramlila artists are facing difficulty since the Covid-19 pandemic and are jobless since March 21, when the performance was grounded.

The state has received 46% excess rainfall this year from June 1 till date, highest since 2011.After a timely onset and relatively weak start in June, the monsoon activity picked up pace in August as heavy rainfall lashed the state. In a span of 10 days, between August 10 and August 20, the southwest monsoon dumped 270.4 mm of rain as against the normal of 77.2 mm, resulting in reservoirs brimming over, submerging large tracts of agricultural land.So far, Telangana has received 1082.5 mm (approximately 108 cm) rainfall as against normal of 742.1 mm from June 1 till date, a level not witnessed since 2011 when the state received 13% lesser rain than usual for the monsoon. Barring Nirmal, all districts have received excess rainfall between two and 134% this year. Meteorologists have attributed the heavy rainfall activity to higher number of weather systems developed over Telangana this year.“We witnessed an increase in the number of low pressure systems over Telangana. There was a low pressure area in June and July each. In August, there were five low pressure systems. Of the five developed in August, two triggered massive rainfall. Conditions from Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea were also very favourable for such intense rains,” IMD, Hyderabad, meteorologist Raja Rao said. Experts said the above normal to excess rainfall this monsoon season can, to a good extent, be attributed to La Nina-like conditions, which has been observed in the tropical Pacific since mid-May. The condition and relevant impacts in general are opposite to the El Nino effect, which spike temperatures and cause drought.“The warmer than normal conditions in the western pacific during La Nina also often result in circulation changes favorable to stronger monsoonal rainfall over many regions of India. La Nina can also facilitate atmospheric circulation changes over the Bay of Bengal favorable for more convection and formation of monsoon lies and depressions,” Prof Ashok Karumuri, Centre for Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Hyderabad, said.Westerly movement of the low pressure areas led to massive rainfall in Telangana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. “Number of systems developed over the Bay of Bengal moved westwards and hence states such as Telangana were among the most affected this monsoon. It was the atmospheric instability of the monsoon flow that led to rain producing systems,” Dr R Radhakrishnan, scientist, head of climate change center, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78343132,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-283874,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/46-excess-rainfall-this-year-highest-since-2011/articleshow/78340602.cms

District guardian minister Satej Patil, who will head the 17-member committee, said, “Once the Covid pandemic ends, we will speed up the paper work and finalise the plan for the memorial. Then the actual construction work will start.”

The minister said the meetings of the panel will start soon, mainly through online mode, and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will be kept updated about the developments.

The panel, formed five years ago, was not re-constituted with a defined role. As per the order issued by general administration department (GAD), the committee should draft the plan with estimates and submit it through the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation in six months.

The demand to set up a memorial was made after the Congress-NCP government announced setting up of a memorial for Babasaheb Ambedkar at the Indu Mill site in Mumbai. Then chief minister Prithviraj Chavan had made the announcement on the Shahu memorial in the legislative session in December 2012.

As per the GAD order, the urban development department should ensure 26 acre of land is handed over to the KMC. It is under the control of the state textile corporation.

According to sources, the corporation had estimated the cost of the land at around Rs 68 crore, but it has to be worked out afresh.

The tenure for the panel is fixed for one year and it will have to get primary things done before the tenure ends.

206,['27/09/2020'],"Victims, convicts have no say in early release: Madras high court","File photo: Madras high court

CHENNAI: When authorities consider case of convicts for premature release/remission, victims of the crime have no right of personal hearing, the Madras high court has held.

“Authorities concerned do not conduct a hearing for convicts as they do not have a right of being personally heard in matters of remission . There is, therefore, no justification for the appellants to claim personal hearing when the convicts themselves are evenly placed in the matter,” said the first bench of chief justice A P Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy.

The judges passed the order on a petition filed by a victim, whose son and brother were killed by a gang in a gruesome manner in broad day light in Puducherry in 2004. Five men were convicted for the double murder and sentenced to imprisonment for life.

Petitioner Dhanasekari and two others apprehended that the convicts — Venkatesh, Sathish, Narayanan, Madhan, and Jai Shankar — serving life imprisonment, would kill the entire family if released early on remission.

Dismissing the appeal, the bench, however, considered the apprehension of the petitioners and said the authority concerned should take into consideration all relevant material, including the objections raised by the appellants, before deciding on the remission.

According to the prosecution, the murder was the result of a gang war in which both sides lost several lives. The five convicts moved an application under a government scheme for early release/remission. When the committee concerned took the applications for consideration, the petitioners filed an objection that the remission should not be decided without giving them an opportunity of personal hearing.

On January 2, 2019, a single judge of the court dismissed the original petition moved by the petitioners. Challenging the dismissal, the petitioners have moved the present appeal.

Rejecting the appeals, the first bench said, “The scales of opportunity to be offered to the convict and the victim have to be evenly balanced. Remission is a discretion to be exercised as per some settled parameters and not as a routine exercise. The convict has only an opportunity for consideration for premature release as it touches upon the concept of liberty.”

At the ward-level reservoirs, we test for chlorine levels and add more if it is found to be less so that quality of water is maintained at it flows through the pipelines,” he said.Last year the BMC replaced 42km of pipeline and 15,000 service connections. At 130 slum locations, it replaced bunches of thin pipes with a single pipeline of adequate length and depth and ensured a water connection to every household.The city now has 17 water tunnels, which ensure there is no tampering of pipelines, no leakages and no pilferage. Work on another three is underway and a feasibility study is being carried out for a Thane-Mulund tunnel.Rathore said the department gives top priority to complaints of contamination. “The water supply to the area is stopped and tankers are pressed into service. In the meantime, the hydrant is flushed, checks are carried out for leakages, and water is first tested for any contamination before the supply is restored,” he said.Marginal dip in air pollution in 2019-20, reveals annual reportThe city saw a marginal dip in pollution levels in 2019-20 compared to the year before that, though the levels were above the permissible limits. The BMC Environment Status Report 2019-20 said the annual average concentration of the hazardous PM 2.5 (less than 2.5 microns) and PM 10 was 54 micrograms per cubic metre and 93 mg/m3, respectively.The BMC report each year collates the annual average levels for pollutants from monitoring stations run by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research and itself.The most critical of all air pollutants, particulate matter, a mix of solid and liquid particles that include dust, sand, smoke, lead, nickel and arsenic, gets lodged in lung tissues and causes respiratory problems. The annual report revealed that the annual average PM 10 (particulate matter under 10 microns) levels for all the nine locations monitored were above than the Central Pollution Control Board’s permissible limit of 60 µg/ m3 (micrograms per cubic metre).",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78347353,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-363639,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-water-continues-to-give-filter-cos-run-for-their-money/articleshow/78347288.cms

212,['27/09/2020'],Waterlogging on SCB roads irks residents,"Secunderabad: Life in various colonies of Secunderabad Cantonment was thrown out of gear due to incessant rains in the last two days.

Residents of Harshavardhan Colony, Ramreddy Colony and Srinivasa Colony in New Bowenpally were forced to stay indoors with roads inundated on Saturday. The situation was no different in 50 other residential colonies.

“The SCB officials have not to taken steps to repair decades old sewer networks. We have been facing inundation of lanes and bylanes for more than two decades. Our representations to set it right have fallen on their deaf ears,” Shankar Reddy, a resident of Harshvardhan Colony, told STOI.

Radhika, a former bank employee of Srinivasa Colony, said: “We pay property tax and water bills promptly, but the Cantonment Board does not spend any money on providing even basic amenities for the residents.” The main road at Bapuji Nagar in Bowenpally, which is used by nearly 50,000 commuters every day, is under 2ft rainwater. “Special teams are monitoring the waterlogging points in Cantonment,” SCB (SWM) senior superintendent M Devender said.

HYDERABAD: Lanes of Kodandaram Nagar in LB Nagar, which received highest rainfall of 133 mm till Saturday morning, turned into rivers after the Saroornagar lake breached.

Heavy rains that lashed the city for two consecutive days forced people to stay indoors as many houses were inundated with knee-deep water.

Bouts of heavy rainfall, which started during wee hours of Friday, left several parts of Gaddianaram division of LB Nagar inundated. Two-wheelers were seen floating on the roads and many four-wheelers were submerged in rainwater. “After the Saroornagar lake bund was breached, all the excess water started gushing into our houses. In knee-deep water, even cooking was difficult. With children in the house, we were even scared of having water snakes and contracting other diseases,” said Jayashree Kondeti, a resident of Kodandaram Nagar. Adding to their woes, power supply was also snapped around 7 am and was not restored until evening.

Situation was much the same at Sisal Basthi of Gaddianaram division of LB Nagar where residents were seen using ropes to help their neighbours cross the road. At Sisal Basthi, the water level was much higher as cars were seen 80 per cent submerged under water. At Reddy Colony in Hasthinapuram division in LB Nagar, people were seen struggling on water-logged roads. Commuters driving through Vanasthalipuram, Sagar Ring road, Tapovan Colony and Hayathnagar also had a tough time due to water-logged roads.

215,['27/09/2020'],"19 years on, man hacks away father’s murderer","Representative image

NAGPUR: Kishore Binekar alias Balya, an alleged gambling kingpin from Lalgunj Khairipura, was stabbed and hacked to death with sharp weapons and axe in full public view at Bole petrol pump Square on Saturday evening.

Unconfirmed sources stated that Balya was also shot from close range but no empty case was found from the spot. It is learnt, the murder is fallout of a revenge by a man whose father was hacked to death by Balya, his father and his family in 2001.

Sources close to Balya’s family also claimed that the assailants fled with cash at least Rs five lakh, substantial gold and some other material.

It’s also learnt Balya used to keep some weapon which was not found later in the car. CCTV footage of the murder showed the assailants entering the car and spending some time inside the vehicle after the murder.

Sitabuldi police have registered an offence of murder. Crime branch has rounded up one Aseem Lurerkar from Khamla shortly after the murder. The cops are now trying to zero in on Chetan Hazare, named in the notorious jail break incident in which five inmates had escaped, for allegedly planning the murder.

Hazare was a minor when Balya had stabbed his father Sunil to death 19 years ago. Cops stated that Hazare too was spotted in the CCTV footage as the man wearing a helmet and smashing the car’s driver side window with an axe.

Hazare has several offences including two attempts to murder against him. Hazare had vowed to eliminate Balya who had an altercation with him in the past.

The other suspects include Ushar Barse, who is seen firing a shot and later entering the car too along with others, chain-snatcher Bharat Pandit, seen on a bullet in front of the car, along with Rajat Tambe.

The CCTV footage, which went viral on social media, showed five assailants hacking Balya to death in a manner straight out of a Bollywood potboiler. A bullet rider (believed to be Pandit) had parked his bike in front as Balya’s car stopped at the Bole Petrol pump signal.

As he kept turning back, the other assailants approached Balya’s car and attacked him. It’s learnt, Balya had left his residence at Dharampeth and was heading towards Ravi Nagar from where he used to come to his gambling den at Lalgunj Khairipura.

Balya had a ‘Robinhood’ image at Lalgunj Khairipura. His den was located near a railway line and during raids the gamblers would make cops run behind them on the tracks, creating chances of getting run over by a train.

Despite having at least 14 offences against him, including a double murder as a juvenile and then again in 2006 ( Sanjay Falke ), Balya was known for donating to economically weaker families of Lalgunj Khairipura.

It’s learnt, Hazare and his gang had thrashed a friend of Balya over a monetary dispute in the past. Hazare and his gang were partners in a gambling den of Balu Taklya who also claimed to be close to a top cop.

Balya was also a staunch rival of his own brother Rajesh and cousins Golu and Dheeraj who have been rounded up by crime branch. Golu and Dhiraj had assaulted Balya’s friend last year.

216,['27/09/2020'],Every pandemic has led into increase in suicides: Expert,"Nagpur: Vidarbha is going through the worst phase of Covid-19 pandemic and the region is riding a peak in number of cases. Generally, there are reports about people affected, treated and lost due to pandemic. “But its impact is not restricted to physical affliction only. The psychological and social manifestations are immeasurable. Rising trends of suicides can certainly be taken as indicators of the impact,” said Dr Anagha Sinha , consultant psychiatrist from city.

“Suicide is the last rung on the ladder. To decrease suicidal behaviour, it is imperative that we decrease stress-related disorders in a crisis situation like the Covid pandemic,” she said.

According to Dr Sinha, history suggests that a pandemic hits every few decades and leads to stress, anxiety and depression. “We are the latest generation to have witnessed a pandemic. The statistics are scary. These factors leading to stress, anxiety and depression – the precursors to suicide,” she said.

According to her, uncertainty about the future, economic decline, fear of acquiring the disease, fear of losing our near and dear ones are some of the reasons of suicides in pandemic.

“The overall vulnerability and stress increases in a pandemic but not all of us our affected to an equal degree. Individuals predisposed to mental illness, illicit substance users, front line workers are at greatest risk. Changing social attitudes around us, the stigma and misconceptions about the disease and the ostracization that comes with it can be an added burden,” she said.

Studies on mental illness reveal that family and close proximity to people, such as that seen in the Indian subcontinent, is a significant factor in the mental well-being of people. “We, as people, are culturally conditioned to share the burden of any crises. But in today’s scenario of social isolation this support system has suddenly been taken away from us. Coping with this new normal can be a daunting task for many,” she said.

People often complain of loneliness which is a major factor in suicidal tendencies. Dr Sinha further said, “The lack of outdoor and engaging activities which contribute to eustress or good stress such as getting dressed, driving to work, and going to school are missing for many. A set routine with which our bodies and minds were in tune since childhood are no longer there. The constant hammering from the social media painting a dismal picture can act as a catalyst to anxiety, depression and eventually suicide.”

Then what can we do in this scenario? “First and foremost, do not be overwhelmed. Seeking out the positives and taking one day at a time will prove to be a good start. Aim at staying connected despite physical isolation,” said Dr Sinha.

“While keeping yourself updated, it’s important to focus on authentic sources of information and cutting down on disturbing pieces of news. Make good use of the helplines and telemedicine which have brought doctors to your doorstep. Try to divert your mind from futile thoughts and worries,” she said adding that ‘I will worry about it when it actually happens’ can be the best attitude.

“Lastly, keep a vigilant eye for the warning signs of physical and mental illness in oneself and others, and seek timely help,” said Dr Sinha.

CHENNAI: The eight fishermen from the city, who were rescued by Myanmar coast guard personnel after getting stranded mid sea for 55 days, are likely to return on Monday.

Steps are being taken by the Centre and the state government to bring them back. The fishermen were in a port town called Sittwe and were flown out to Yangon on Saturday.

South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association President K Bharathi said the government is taking steps to bring them back by flight from Yangon to Delhi, and from there to Chennai. “We are trying to bring them to Chennai the same day they reach Delhi. Steps were being taken to bring them by sea route along with the boat with the help of the Coast Guard. That would have been ideal. But plans have changed now,” he added.

He added that the men are in good health and happy, waiting to return. “The boat will have to remain there and it may take time and effort to bring it back.”

They were among the nine fishermen who set out on a boat on July 23, went missing for 55 days till they were rescued by Myanmar CG after they spotted them drifting close to the nation’s shore. One of the fishermen had gone missing in Myanmar when he jumped into the water at the harbour to rescue a fisherman who was repairing a boat called for help. He had gone to the harbour from the custody of Indian Embassy officials and spotted some fishermen calling for help when a rope got entangled in the engine of a boat during repairs.

The massive blast left one person dead and six injured.

Not only a man but also four monkeys sitting on the terrace of the house were killed in the explosion.

The explosion took place in a stockpile of firecrackers at one Jogendra’s house around 1 am on Saturday when everyone was sleeping.

Jogendra died on the spot, while his wife Shivani (22) was referred to Agra’s SN Medical College with critical injuries. Other injured include Jogendra’s sister Savita (18), mother Indravati (55), neighbours — Suneel Kumar (40), Mahendra (48) and his son Deepanshu (13).

Mathura chief fire officer Pramod Sharma, who is investigating the case, told TOI, “Firecrackers being manufactured and stored at the house illegally were destroyed in the blast. A few adjoining houses in a radius of 60 metre were damaged, too, due to the impact of the explosion.”

“Two houses were completely damaged,” said the CFO, adding: “We are investigating the cause of the blast, but it seems a short circuit in the room where the crackers and other explosives were illegally stored caught fire and exploded.”

Police, meanwhile, seized 15.2 kg explosive and sent it for testing at a forensic lab in Lucknow and registered an FIR against eight people under relevant sections of the Explosive Substances Act for illegal storage of firecrackers on the premises.

“The family was running the illegal business since 2017. Earlier, they had a licence for manufacturing and selling firecrackers,” said the CFO.

“We were sleeping when the blast rocked the neighbourhood,” said Soniya Devi, who lives in an adjacent house. “We immediately came out of our house and what we saw was devastation. The high-intensity blast left nearby houses damaged badly and cracks in the ceiling of my house.”

The previous state government had given its nod to the NMC to take over the city bus service from the ailing Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC). The civic body had plans to deploy 400 buses, including 200 CNG, 50 diesel and 150 electric. As many as 250 swanky buses, including 200 CNG and 50 diesel variants, had arrived in the city by March-end and had even got the RTO passing. But the project was delayed due to Covid-19 outbreak.

So far, the NMC has deployed two agencies to operate the city bus service. The agencies will, altogether, operate 250 buses, including 200 CNG and 50 diesel. The NMC has also finalised an agency to operate 150 electric buses, but it has not yet given work order to the agency concerned.

NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav told TOI that earlier the civic body had plans to start the city bus service from April, but it could not do so due to the pandemic.Now, the focus is on Covid-19 outbreak. The drop in revenue is another concern as the NMC’s revenue through property and water taxes have reduced. “Therefore, we are planning to launch the city bus service around Diwali, but we will not run all the buses at one time. We would initially ply about 50 buses. Depending on the response, the fleet would be increased at regular intervals,” said Jadhav.

The civic commissioner said he will review the project and will also visit various sites to check the infrastructure. “We have to build two bus depots and six terminals. I will review the infrastructure and other related projects with the officials concerned shortly,” he said.

The bus service is to be operated on a gross-cutting contract (GCC) for a period of 10 years. This includes the purchase of new buses, maintenance of buses, employing drivers, purchasing fuel, etc. NMC will pay charges to private agencies on a kilometre basis.

These panchayats are not just passing resolutions urging the Union government to withdraw the bills but have also initiated the process to call Gram Sabha sessions to build consensus against the Centre’s legislations.

As per the Panchayati Raj Act provision, an announcement has to be made in the village at least a week in advance to call a Gram Sabha session, so that everybody can join it.

Accordingly, the panchayats of Jaimal Singh Wala, Dhilwan and Cheema in Barnala district, and Gharacho, Chhahar, Chhajli and Mehla Chowk in Sangrur have called sessions of Gram Sabha on September 30, for which announcements were made on September 23.

Besides, a lot of other panchayats have also started making announcements and the Gram Sabha sessions are expected to be convened there in the first or second week of October.

Sarpanch Jagjit Singh of Wander Jatana village in Faridkot said, “In a meeting, the village panchayat has rejected the agri bills and asked the Union government to withdraw those, or else they would hold protests. An announcement has also been made in the village for holding the session of Gram Sabha on October 4, where every member will get a chance to speak.”

Similarly, sarpanch Veer Singh of Khosa Kotla village in Moga told TOI, “The village panchayat has already rejected the anti-farmer bills. The Gram Sabha session will be convened soon to hold a debate on the issue, which is crucial for the farming community.”

“Over a hundred village panchayats in Barnala and Sangrur districts have started the process to call Gram Sabha sessions. Many panchayats have joined hands to oppose these bills. They have even announced to hold protests on their own,” said a member of the panchayat union in Barnala.

Earlier, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had also given a call to the panchayats to convene Gram Sabha sessions. Party’s state president and MP Bhagwant Mann had three days ago urged the village panchayats to call Gram Sabha sessions. He had also released a video clip giving finer details of the process to call such sessions.

“Following that call, hundreds of sarpanches have contacted me. Rising above party lines, most of the panchayat heads have assured me to call Gram Sabha sessions and pass resolutions with voice vote and send these to the President of India and the Prime Minister through SDMs,” Bhagwant Mann told TOI.

227,['27/09/2020'],SNMC fails to fulfill increased demand for oxygen,"Agra: With all the beds now occupied in the emergency ward and ICU of the Covid care facility, the SN Medical College in Agra is finding it increasingly difficult to fulfill the demand for oxygen. The existing 6,000 kilolitre oxygen tank, earlier filled once in two days, is now required to be filled every day. The existing 22mm oxygen supply pipeline has failed to deliver the required amount of oxygen for ICU.

According to sources, on the complaint of doctors, the hospital administration has sent a proposal to the state government to set up a 44mm supply pipeline. Besides, work for replacement of 6,000 kilolitre oxygen tank with 11,000 kilolitre tank has been initiated.

SNMC principal Dr Sanjay Kala said, “The size of liquid oxygen supply pipeline is small. This is affecting the required amount of oxygen supply to ICU beds occupied by Covid patients. A proposal has been sent to the state government to set up a large pipeline for the high flow oxygen supply. We are also working on establishing an 11,000 kilolitre capacity oxygen tank. The issues related to the oxygen supply caused by the increase in the number of Covid-19 patients in critical condition will be sorted very soon.”

He added, “We are trying to keep the emergency beds vacant for new patients. We have started conducting TrueNat testing of patients admitted in emergency wards thrice a day. After testing, patients found Covid-19 positive are being transferred to the Covid care centre. We have kept 30 oxygen cylinders as spare at the emergency ward. Two new dedicated ambulances for suspected Covid patients have been deployed. We are trying to make arrangements for additional ICU beds.”

232,['27/09/2020'],Let opposition prove graft charge: Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa,"DIN IN ASSEMBLY: Lawmakers attend the last day of the session

BENGALURU: After a seven-and-a-half hour debate in the assembly, rocked by allegations of corruption against chief minister BS Yediyurappa ’s son BY Vijayendra, the no-confidence motion moved against the BJP government was defeated by a voice vote on Saturday.

The highlight of the debate was the charges levelled against Vijayendra and war of words between Yediyurappa and opposition leader Siddaramaiah . A sting operation by a private TV channel on the alleged involvement of Vijayendra in a land scam was at the core of the heated exchanges.

Yediyurappa categorically rejected the Congress demand for an SIT probe into the alleged involvement of his family members in the BDA scam.

“It is you who have made allegations and the onus lies on you to prove them. If there is even an iota of truth in allegations, I will resign and quit politics forever. If not, are you ready to resign?” Yediyurappa asked Siddaramaiah .

Siddaramaiah dared the government to order an inquiry by a retired Supreme Court judge if Yediyurappa is so sure the allegations are false.

Yediyurappa said: “We’re not going to order any probe. You can go to court or Lokayukta and get the matter probed.”

The CM also attacked Congress members Krishna Byregowda and Dinesh Gundurao for demanding an inquiry.

It all started with Siddaramaiah, during his speech over the no-confidence motion, raising the sting operation and reading out WhatsApp chats alleged to have been take place between Vijayendra and representative of the news channel.

Law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy objected to taking the name of Vijayendra as he’s not a member of the house and said the channel’s allegations are false and baseless. He requested the chair not to allow Siddaramaiah to continue with the issue unless he has proof. Ministers Jagadish Shettar and Basavaraj Bommai and other members also demanded that a discussion should not be allowed.

""I have every right to speak. I am not making any allegations and I don't even know who Vijayendra is. The matter is already in public domain,” he said.

Later, speaker Kageri pacified ruling party members to allow Siddaramaiah to continue.

Siddaramaiah concluded by demanding an SIT probe under the supervision of a Supreme Court judge. ""If it is proved there is no truth in allegations, I will resign,"" he said.

VIJAYAWADA: With the administration keen on providing safe drinking water to every household in the district, Krishna district has soon have 100% safe drinking water coverage.

According to a recent study by the administration, of the 7.8 lakh households in the district, only 2.61 lakh are connected to the safe drinking water scheme while 95,910 households are under process. Nearly 4.5 lakh households in the district do not have access to water tap connections.

234,['27/09/2020'],These women toil on KIA tarmac to ensure planes can take wing,"She specialises in aircraft circuits and panels

BENGALURU: The last Saturday of September is observed internationally as Girls in Aviation Day with the aim of encouraging young girls to take up a career in the field. STOI takes a look at two women handling aircraft maintenance — a branch of aviation dominated by men — at Kempegowda International Airport.

She has handled many snag situations

As a student in Kolar, Archana KY had only one dream — to become a pilot. After passing high school, she was disheartened to realise that the cost of aircraft pilot training was way beyond her family’s reach. “But I was determined not to let go of my ambition to be near an aircraft and pursued aircraft maintenance engineering,” said Archana, who is an aircraft maintenance technician for IndiGo airlines .

The 22-year-old examines aircraft from nose to tail to declare them fit for flight. In her two years of experience at KIA , Archana has handled numerous snag situations, including bird hits and engine and blade troubles.

“When I began my career, I had to encounter doubtful queries from my friends on how a girl like me can climb over an aircraft and do all the physical work. But I proved all of them wrong,” laughs the young engineer who was the national gold medallist of the Skill India challenge where she had to successfully fix an aircraft engine .

Well-versed with the Airbus A320 engine, Archana can be seen toiling over IndiGo planes before takeoff and after landing. She still nurses the dream of flying a plane someday.

She specialises in aircraft circuits and panels

In 2017, when an aircraft landed in Jaipur, a crack was detected in one of its windshields. A young woman stepped up to the occasion and immediately rushed to the spot to fix a light sensor in the shield. Avionics engineer Shikha Pushp was lauded for her work despite being a beginner.

Shikha now works as an aircraft maintenance engineer, the only woman to hold the post for IndiGo airlines at KIA. She began her career in 2012 in Delhi after completing aeronautical engineering from Jamshedpur and her speciality is aircraft circuits, panels and on-board computers.

“Very few women choose a profession which entails dealing with airplane panels, which are filed with hundreds of circuits,” said the 31-year-old who was posted to KIA in 2018.

Shikha, from Bihar, was always fascinated by aircraft. “In my job, precision and focus are key. Even a single screw has to be dealt with care and utmost professionalism as hundreds of lives may be involved,” she said.

She’s the only woman to have passed out from the airbus training centre in Bengaluru (2016 batch) and is among the very few licensed women engineers who can declare an aircraft fit for flying.

235,['27/09/2020'],Social media helping kitchens source ingredients from across the country,"Representative image

VISAKHAPATNAM: With inter-state travel reduced considerably due to the pandemic, several non-Telugu communities in the city have formed individual WhatsApp groups where they are placing orders for ingredients, which are either unavailable or have unsteady supply in the city, for the community’s favourite dishes. Earlier, they used to procure those ingredients through friends and relatives who used to travel to and fro the city and their home states.

“Following the pandemic, travel has reduced and we (Bengalese) were thinking on how to source those ingredients from somewhere. I got in touch with an online essential commodity delivery company in Kolkata and then formed a WhatsApp group adding people from my community in Visakhapatnam and the wholesaler,” 62-year old Ira Tarafdar told TOI.

Last week, a section of people from the Bengali community in the city had placed an order for 27 kg of Bangladeshi hilsa fish and packs of Gobindo Bhog rice (scented processed rice) through one of their WhatsApp group. The commodities reached the city on Tuesday morning on a freight train from Santraganchi.

Although people from neighbouring Odisha are in a better position when it comes to procurement of ingredients for Oriya cuisine, people from the state living in the city have also followed the trail.

“Normally, all ingredients for our cuisine come from Bhubaneshwar, Behrampore and Raygada and are easily available in the city. However, following the lockdown the supply wasn’t steady. So, we also formed a WhatsApp group and are placing order directly to the wholesale merchants,” said BK Mohanty, a software executive.

Wholesalers said the railways, after the lockdown, had reduced the freight charges considerably. So, when individuals are placing orders on the groups they are sending the entire consignment in bulk together, generally once a week. This has made the import cost above the cost of the products affordable.

240,['27/09/2020'],SAD left NDA for political compulsion: Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh,"Activists of farm bodies at Jalandhar Cantt railway station

CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has termed the Akalis’ decision to quit the NDA as nothing more than a ‘desperate case of political compulsion’ for the Badals, who, he said, were effectively left with no other option after the BJP ’s public criticism of the SAD stance on the farm bills.

Citing his earlier statement, in which he had said NDA would throw the Akalis out if the latter did not leave themselves gracefully, Amarinder said there is no moral high ground involved in this decision of SAD.

The Akalis had no choice after BJP made it clear that it held SAD responsible for not being able to convince the farmers about the positives of the agriculture bills.

The SAD decision to quit NDA was just the culmination of their saga of lies and deception, which eventually led to their being cornered on the issue of bills, said the chief minister, adding that Sukhbir Singh Badal was virtually caught between the devil and the deep sea after his initial unprincipled stand on the legislations, followed by the sudden U-turn in the face of farmer protests.

Amarinder said with the BJP-led ruling coalition at the Centre exposing the SAD’s web of lies, fabrications and double-speak, the Akalis could not have done anything but leave the NDA. But, their quitting the alliance would not help them save their faces, which they probably hope for, and the Akalis would find themselves in a bigger political mess now, having been left with no place either in Punjab or at the Centre, he added.

He said if Sukhbir Singh Badal, Harsimrat Kaur Badal and other SAD leaders have any shame left, they should admit to their deceitful actions while part of the Union government and should be begging the farmers for forgiveness.

241,['27/09/2020'],Land reforms bill passed in Karnataka with changes,"BENGALURU: The state government on Saturday retracted the increase in land ceiling and passed a reamended amendment to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act of 1964 which allows non-agriculturists to purchase agricultural land and removes income limits for owning it.

The decision to withdraw increase in land ceiling limits, from 10 units (54 acres) to 20 units (108 acres) for a single family member and from 20 (108 acres) to 40 units (216 acres) for a family of over five members comes in the wake of chief minister BS Yediyurappa meeting protesting farmer leaders and discussions with JD(S) floor leader HD Kumaraswamy on Friday evening.

The BJP government hopes the decision to withdraw increase in land ceiling will assuage farmers agitating across the state against the amendments.

The goverment scrapped sections 79 A & B which restricted people with over Rs 25 lakh income to purchase farm land and also barred non-agriculturists to purchase agricultural properties.

The amendment, despite the retraction, did not go well with the Congress which protested and stormed out of the house in protest.

Earlier, opposition leader Siddaramaiah said the decision to scrap Sections 79 A&B was only an “excuse” to make way for corporates and housing societies to purchase agricultural land for real estate business.

“The entire bill is being tabled to please the corporates and housing societies in Karnataka that hold over 50,220 acres of land,” said Siddaramaiah. He alleged the decision to implement the amendment in retrospect would mean that 13,814 cases lodged against various people will be withdrawn.

However, JD(S) floor leader HD Kumaraswamy backed the BJP decision.

Citing personal experience of how political rivals in Ramanagara district misused these sections to foist cases against him regarding farm land he purchased in Kethiganahalli near Bidadi, he said the sections would help many people interested in agriculture.

Revenue minister R Ashoka mentioned the decision to scrap Sections 79 A & B was not of the BJP government alone but was also proposed by the previous Congress government.

“While we may be introducing the bill, the thinking to scrap the section was proposed and endorsed by several senior Congress leaders including RV Deshpande, DK Shivakumar and Mallikarjuna Kharge over the last few decades,” he said.

The bill was later passed in its renewed form.

Won’t allow land misuse: BSY

Chief minister BS Yediyurappa, during the debate, said the government will not allow the misuse of even a single acre of small and marginal farmers or those from scheduled castes or scheduled tribes. “We’ll protect their lands at any cost,” he said in response to independent MLA N Mahesh.

But in Punjab, the party is facing heat on social media due to agri-marketing bills. Even as the party aggressively defends the bills on its official Facebook page of Punjab unit, most comments were against these bills.

Earlier, its alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) would ‘market’ most of central government decisions, but after SAD also turned against the bills, the challenge has became bigger for the party.

Now, taking matter into their own hands, the party is busy defending the bills in Punjabi too. Apart from reiteration of assurances from the Prime Minister and agriculture minister, several posts have been specifically addressed to farmers of Punjab.

However, but for a few positive comments, most of the comments on these posts are acerbically against the bills and also against the BJP. While Punjabi netizens have not posted comments below the other posts – especially those pertaining to anniversary of Jan Sangh founder Deen Dayal Upadhayay on Friday — every post pertaining to farmers came under scores of adverse comments, in a few cases even in hundreds.

“Farm bills will bring same benefit to farmers, which Jio brought for BSNL,” commented Sukhvir Singh on BJP Punjab page in one such post. “Come to the farmers’ protest to explain them,” posted one Kulwinder Singh. Netizen Gursewak Singh posted “many benefits of demonetisation were enumerated. Were there any?”. Quite a few netizens asked tongue-in-cheek how can the BJP convince others if they cannot not convince their partner SAD.

The flood of anti-bills messages seem to be not only from people with farming background or from rural areas. Many urbanites seem to have taken digs at the Union government and have expressed solidarity with farmers.

On Friday, a group named “Justice for Punjabi Hindus” apart from using abusive language for the protestors also posted a fake news that “Panthic Jatts” threw stones at a convoy of army vehicles after blocking them on national highway and some army men were even injured. The group had also posted messages chiding Hindus who have joined the farmers’ protests.

VISAKHAPATNAM: A section of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) volunteers has been culling stray dogs after failing to implement the animal birth control (ABC) programme and control the population of stray dogs, alleged an animal activist in the city.

The activist, Pradeep Nath, filed a complaint with GVMC commissioner G Srijana and district collector V Vinay Chand on Saturday afternoon.

“The GVMC workers are secretly killing at least 10 dogs a day starting from August at its Arilova unit and are dumping them at the Arilova dumping ground. This is illegal and inhumane. I have requested the GVMC commissioner and the district collector to carry out a detailed investigation and punish the offenders,” Nath, who is the founder-member of Visakha Society for Protection and Care Of Animals (VSPCA), told STOI.

Speaking to STOI, GVMC commissioner G Srijana said she ordered an inquiry immediately after some photographs of dead stray dogs went viral on Twitter. “As per protocol, we (GVMC) don’t kill stray dogs. So, a detailed inquiry has been ordered to see what has actually happened,” the GVMC chief added.

On Thursday, TOI reported that the implementation of the ABC and anti-rabies vaccination (ARV) programmes for stray dogs in the city had been poor following the Covid-19 outbreak, leading to fears of a growing stray dog problem and cases of rabies.

“But in no way is the killing of dogs like this acceptable. We have carried out a primary investigation seeking information from one of our sources at the civic body. It was found that GVMC workers are killing these dogs by feeding them magnesium sulphate solution. In fact, a senior GVMC official had registered a police complaint and a criminal proceeding has been started against the volunteer who was informing us,” added Nath.

Earlier in June, a similar complaint surfaced at Siddipet municipality in Telangana after four municipal workers allegedly poisoned 40 stray dogs. Following an investigation, Siddipet district collector Venkatarama Reddy suspended the workers.

Around 2,300 street lights in these wards will be replaced with LED streetlight poles.Taken up under the Vizag Smart City initiative with a budget of around Rs 20.5crore, GVMC initially installed around 5,480 poles with solar LED integrated lighting fixtures. The civic body spent Rs 11crore on the project on the Beach Road nearly two years ago.According to officials of the GVMC Smart City wing, the bidder has already started laying foundations of solar poles in the ABD area and foundation has been laid for around 600-700 poles. The standalone solar street-lighting system does away with the need of field cabling with no maintenance costs as the solar panels last more than 20 years. The aesthetics of these lights will also be enhancedApart from commissioning the project, the bidder will also take care of all operation and maintenance of the project for the next five years. A wireless remote monitoring and control system will be embedded into the lighting system to control lighting levels and remote monitor battery charging and discharging levels.Before embracing the solar street light system, GVMC was also a pioneer in adopting LED street lights in the country. Nearly 1 lakh incandescent lights were replaced with LED lights. Following the introduction of the LED lights project, energy consumption came down from nearly 20 lakh units a month to 12 lakh units per month on average.The 2MW floating solar project, set up at a cost of Rs 13.4crore at Mudasarlova, will alone save Rs 2.3crore on electricity bills.",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78342884,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-100946,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/smartening-up-more-areas-in-vizag-to-get-solar-street-lights/articleshow/78339448.cms

VADODARA: After a gap of over six months, the Sardar Patel Zoological Jungle Safari Park (SPZJSP) spread over 375 acres near Statue of Unity (SoU) at Kevadiya colony in Narmada district will be thrown open for tourists from October 1.

Popularly known as the ‘Jungle Safari’, the park, one of the biggest tourist attractions at Kevadiya colony, had opened on trial basis in February this year. But just within a month of its opening, it was closed down for tourists in the month of March due to Covid-19 induced pandemic and lockdown.

It is being re-opened ahead of the likely visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is expected to formally inaugurate it along with the seaplane service between Ahmedabad and SoU on October 31.

It is the first attraction surrounding SoU which is being opened for tourists who can book online tickets for the park that has over 1,000 animals and birds from SoU website.

“We have received permission to open the park on a trial basis. Only 50 visitors will be allowed to enter the premises in an hour following social distancing norms while wearing masks is compulsory,” said SPZJSP director Ram Ratan Nala.

The park has rhinoceroses, tigers, giraffes, bison, leopards, 12 types of deer, antelopes and many other animals in 16 enclosures.

It also has the facility of golf e-cart. The park, developed by the state forest department in record six months, has been divided into seven elevations from entrance plaza to wild enclosures. The park has been designed in such a manner that people would feel as if they are in a jungle.

GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government has proposed setting up dedicated toy manufacturing clusters in the state and has invited top Indian and multinational toy manufacturers, as well as startups to set up operations in Gujarat.

In his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio talk last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked people to make the country a hub for the manufacture of world-class toys. The PM also urged startups and entrepreneurs to develop “toys and games, for India and of India” to meet domestic demand and increase the country’s share in the global toy business, estimated to be worth Rs 7 lakh crore.

International toy manufacturing companies like Nintendo Co Ltd and Tomy Co Ltd from Japan, Hasbro and Mattel from the US, Siumba Toys from Germany along with Namco Bandai, Lego, and Jakks Pacific have been invited by the Gujarat government to start their production units in the state.

Manoj Das, additional chief secretary (ACS), chief minister’s office (CMO) and in-charge ACS, industry and mines department has written to top international toy manufacturers from the USA, Canada, Europe and Japan and assured them the best possible assistance at toy manufacturing clusters in Gujarat.

In his letter to a top Japanese toy manufacturing company, Das wrote that with more than 25% of India’s population in the age group of 0-14 years, the PM has underlined the potential strength and sizable market for companies to set up toy manufacturing facilities in India. “Gujarat is the epicentre of industrial growth in India and has been witnessing double-digit GSDP growth (13% in 2018-19) for more than a decade. The state has the highest industrial output in the country and recorded the highest growth in FDI which grew by 240% in the last year. We have made this possible with our investor-friendly approach, investor hand-holding and robust industrial infrastructure,” the letter said.

The letter added that Gujarat has a well-developed ecosystem for plastic products, wood products, rubber products, specialty chemicals, metals, etc. which ensures easy availability of materials required for toy manufacturing. “In terms of infrastructure, Gujarat offers a variety of options such as plug-and-play industrial estates developed by Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC), Special Economic Zones and even Special Investment Regions,” the letter said.

The letter lists incentives available under the new industrial policy. “The policy offers several path-breaking incentives in the form of 12% of capital subsidy with no ceiling, government land on lease, incentives for research and development entities and special incentives to companies planning to move operations from abroad to the state. The government of Gujarat is keen on inviting the best industries to set up toy manufacturing units in Gujarat,” the letter said.

Das said, “We have a plan to develop clusters for toy manufacturing in Gujarat and the government has invited international and Indian toy manufacturing companies along with startups.”

253,['27/09/2020'],Gujarat yet to clear 54% of PMFBY dues,"AHMEDABAD: Even though the agriculture sector clocked a growth of 3.4% in the first quarter of 2020-21, outperforming other sectors amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, it does not seem to have augmented the income of farmers, at least in seven Indian states including Gujarat. According to data tabled in the parliament, Gujarat government has not cleared dues worth Rs 858.72 crore, towards premium subsidy amount under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) for the kharif season of 2019 and rabi season of 2019-20. Consequently, farmers have been unable to get claim settlements for crop damages, leaving them bereft of revenues.The said amount accounts for at least 54% of the total premium subsidy worth Rs 1,573.51 crore that is supposed to be paid by the state government to insurers. When asked why the dues were not cleared, sources in the state government blamed the insurance companies which have not cleared farmers’ claims in the past.“The state government has been clearing the dues from time to time and has been paying insurance companies. However, last year, the insurance companies did not settle claims put forth by several farmers for crop damage. Nearly 4 lakh farmers from Gujarat had sought settlement of the claims under PMFBY. However, despite state government’s timely payments, a number of claims were rejected. Therefore, the state stopped giving funds to the companies,” said the source.Under the PMFBY, a small share of the premium is borne by the farmer and the remaining is cleared by state and central government through subsidy. Since the state government has not cleared premium subsidies to the insurance companies, farmers are not eligible for getting any claims settled, which only dents their income further.Explaining this, Sagar Rabari, president, Khedut Ekta Manch said, “Once the state and central governments clear premium funds, then only insurance companies release the claim amount. Last year, due to unseasonal rainfall, a number of farmers suffered crop losses and are still awaiting claim settlements. It is a double whammy for farmers. On one hand, they are losing money paid for premium, which are not being refunded by insurance companies. On the other, neither are their claims settled for crop damage nor are they earning anything out of their harvest.”“As a result, farmers are unable to repay their debts, adding to the bad loan burden in the agriculture sector,” he further added.According to the report by State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), the total agriculture NPA (non-performing assets) stood at Rs 6,282 crore in 2019-20, up 10.5% against Rs 5,690 crore in 2018-19.Farmers claim that in 2017-18 and 2018-19, several insurance claims remained unsettled by insurance companies and as a consequence, farmer’s net income took a further hit over the years.“Unsettled claims has caused piling of debts for farmers because their sources of income through selling the crop are drying up and they are also losing out on cost of cultivation and their share of the premium,” said Ratasinh Dodiya, a farmer from Surendranagar.Economists indicate that non-payment of subsidy to the company will not address the issue of augmenting the farmers’ income. “The sole purpose of PMFBY was to provide farmers with a safety net in the event of crop failure or damages. If the insurance companies have not settled claims in the past, stopping premium subsidies is no solution, because farmers continue to suffer. Instead, a better regulation is required to monitor how claims are cleared by companies,” said Sebastian Morris, professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A).",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78346271,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-954241,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-yet-to-clear-54-of-pmfby-dues/articleshow/78341712.cms

LUCKNOW: Anandi and Bajirao came in a royal entourage, alighted in style and trotted through manicured lawns of La Martinere College campus to a red-carpet welcome. The guests of honour — two thoroughbred horses — would soon be exalted members of the school stable.

They arrived on Saturday in a specially designed vehicle — an air-conditioned horse trailer — from farms in Mumbai and Ajmer and were a gift to the college by former students, Monish Bhandari and his wife, Priya. There are already 35 horses in the stable of the school, which has been imparting horse riding lessons for many years. Both are of the Kathiawadi breed, a good cavalry mount and an endangered species found in Kathiawar peninsula of western India.

When Anandi and Bajirao stepped out of the horse trailer with three caretakers in tow, they were the cynosure of all eyes. The trailer was equipped with air conditioners, fans, a room to stock feed, adequate cross ventilation and other provisions.

“We have already gifted our college seven horses as we feel endangered species can only be reared with care at La Martiniere College . We want to promote indigenous horses by gifting them to the right hands. While Bajirao is a bouncy five-year-old stallion, Anandi is an eight-year-old mammoth mare. Both are a class apart and belong to the Kathiawadi breed,” said Priya Bhandari .

The government banned export of Kathiawadi breeds after the horses got the endangered tag. “It’s a pleasure to witness institutions like La Martiniere taking keen interest in supporting indigenous breeds and ensuring they get their due place,” she said.

The committee met in Nashik on Saturday under the leadership of MP Sambhaji Raje Chatrapati. It has rejected any government move to provide reservation to the Maratha community under the economically weaker backward (EWS) category and also warned the government against carrying out any recruitment before the issue is resolved.

Prominent leaders of the community — Narendra Patil Rajendra Kundri, Virendra Pawar — were present at the meeting. MP Chhatrapati Udayan Raje Bhosle, who could not attend the meeting due to some personal reasons, extended his support to the Sakal Maratha Kranti Morcha meeting at Nashik and requested everybody to join the agitation for its final fight.

The committee adopted a resolution about holding agitations outside the residences of MLAs and MPs on October 2, when the elected representatives would be asked to write a letter demanding reservation for the community. The committee also decided to hold agitations in front of the offices of tehsildar and district collector from October 5 to October 10.

It appealed to each of the community members to write a letter to the prime minister and the President requesting them to grant reservation to the Maratha community in Maharashtra.

Another demand in the resolution was that the state government should appeal to the Centre to lift the 50% capping of reservation in the country. The resolution stated that if the government failed to do so, the Marathas would hold protests in Delhi.

On the education front, the morcha demanded that the state government immediately provide 12% more seats across government education organisations for the Maratha community and bear all costs for the same.

Pannun claimed that SJF would start distributing $1 million among the farmers of Punjab and Haryana, following the Delhi rally.

Pannun told TOI on Saturday, “A day after the rally, SFJ will start distributing $1million among farmers who have defaulted agricultural loan payments”.

Stating that the government may not allow farmers to travel freely to the national capital , Pannun has urged truckers who transport produce from Punjab, Haryana, Jammu, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to flock at Modi’s residence on Wednesday and burn copies of farm bills.

Earlier, Pannun had promised reimbursement of $20 service fee to pilgrims levied by Pakistan on the Indian devotees going to pay obeisance at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib , Kartarpur Sahib. He had also offered to give $5,000 and $500 to any Sikh offering Khalistan ardas at Akal Takht and other gurdwara’s respectively on August 23. He had offered to reimburse students’ airfare to London, if they were travelling to attend pro-Khalistan functions in any airlines except Air India.

257,['27/09/2020'],Private groups get govt support for rejuvenating neglected water bodies,"Panaji: To promote the restoration of neglected waterbodies in the state, the Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB) and the Goa State Wetland Authority is now open to extending support to local organisations who are interested in carrying out the work

Recently, an organisation CATCH2O got in touch with the bodies after it had carried out restoration work in three waterbodies in Saligao. The work was conducted voluntarily and the organisation had sought support from the government bodies.

Subsequently, a team of a representative of the water resources department, the member secretary of the GSBB and a scientific officer was formed. This team will access similar proposals from any local organisations or associations who want to carry out conservation and restoration of waterbodies.

Some financial assistance will be approved on a case-to-case basis for the work based on the extent of the waterbody and the restoration work required, said an official.

The work of restoration will include job of clearing the waterbody of any invasive species of vegetation and removal of any waste dumped in it.

Many rivers, lakes, ponds and other water bodies are polluted beyond their self-recovery capacity due to release in them of untreated sewage, debris and dumping of garbage.

Years of neglect of waterbodies also leads to the growth of invasive vegetation, which at times covers nearly the entire water surface of the body, leading to choking of the eco-system. Such invasive species out-compete native organisms for nutrients, which can spell doom for the native species and the waterbody as a whole.

Director of the home Care and Compassion-Goa, Prince Aaron Golden, said that the girls are ‘excited’ about their new smartphones and will not have to attend classes using phones borrowed from the orphanage’s staff.

“I read the report in TOI and felt it was our duty to help. One, it is an orphanage. Two, it is run from the village of Santa Cruz, where my family house is. Six smartphones was their main requirement. It is our duty to make the world a better place and give access to youngsters who have the aspiration to study,” said Dempo Group chairman Shrinivas Dempo. “I would like to thank the TOI and I would want newspapers to get more such stories reported so more responsible citizens can come forward to help,” he said.

Brother-in-law Purnajaya Singh, co-founder of PerspectAI, who provided two of the six smartphones to the home, said he wanted to help with the cause all the more as it involved education of the girl child.

“This is for the education of the girl child. The way we received good education and love of our parents, these are children of an orphanage who want to pursue education. They are the future of our country and it was our duty to help,” said Singh, who has a doctorate in psychology and whose start-up works in the area of human resources technology.

Golden said that thanks to the donation from the Dempo Group and Singh, each of the students studying in the higher classes from the home has a dedicated phone for their studies, as was the requirement of their schools.

Rakesh Jangala hailed from a family of farmers in Khammam. He arrived in London in September 2019 to pursue his masters in engineering management at Greenwich University.

“He used to say that he came from a poor family. If he was able to settle well in life, he could improve the life of his family members as well,” said Laxman Gudipudi, a colleague who worked with Jangala part-time at a warehouse.

Speaking about the campaign, Gudipudi said we hope to raise £50,000 (approx Rs 47lakh) part of which will go towards transporting the body and the other part towards helping the family in this devastating time. “We are making arrangements for the body to be sent back on Tuesday evening,” he said.

Jangala passed away in his sleep on September 24 at his residence, Manor Park, East London due to seizures caused by fits.

264,['27/09/2020'],Punjab &amp; Haryana to start paddy procurement today,"<p>Representative image </p><p><br></p>

CHANDIGARH: Punjab and Haryana on Saturday decided to advance the paddy procurement season, complying with directions from the Centre. The paddy procurement season has now been scheduled from September 27 to November 30.

The directions came as a surprise for the Captain Amarinder Singh government in Punjab as the state is dealing with the ongoing farmer agitation against the Centre’s agri-marketing bills. Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu told TOI that since the state government had all arrangements already in place, it will have no problem in immediately starting the procurement, which was earlier scheduled from October 1. The Centre’s decision could well be a diversionary tactic as it had come amidst the farmer protests, he added.

Even though the Centre has ‘allowed’ Punjab and Haryana to begin early procurement, the arrival of stocks is expected to pick up only in the first week of October.

Haryana too announced that its paddy procurement season will start from September 27 instead of October 1. While the state government has taken this decision “keeping in view the interests of farmers,” sources confirmed that it seems to be a diversionary tactic by the central government to make the farmers divert from protest and start paddy harvest immediately.

Confirming the development, Haryana additional chief secretary (food, civil supplies and consumer affairs ) P K Dass said the procurement would start with PR-126 variety of paddy. This variety has been harvested by farmers of Kurukshetra, Karnal, Ambala and Kaithal districts. Around 4 lakh quintals of paddy has already arrived in the mandis of these four districts.

Adequate arrangements in Haryana have been made by the procurement agencies, including Hafed, Haryana State Warehousing Corporation and food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department.

Gate pass being issued by the Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board to farmers to enter the mandis is being verified through the staff of the market committee. Haryana will also check whether farmers bringing crops to mandi have registered on Meri Fasal-Mera Byora portal. The e-Kharid portal will also start from September 29 to help farmers in Haryana.

Punjab has issued directions for staggered procurement as farmers will be allowed to enter the mandis with passes issued to them 72 hours in advance and only one trolley will be allowed on one pass. Mandi yards have been marked with 30ft X 30Ft blocks to maintain the social distance, said chief secretary Vini Mahajan, who reviewed the state’s preparedness for the procurement process on Saturday.

The Mandi Board will start issuing passes from September 29 and the Punjab government will explore possibility of increasing the number of centres to over 4,500 to ensure hassle-free, smooth and timely procurement of paddy.

265,['27/09/2020'],"In 5 years, all houses in Delhi to get water 24x7, says CM Arvind Kejriwal","CM Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Saturday that after ensuring 24x7 electricity supply, the state government would now strive to provide water 24x7 to every city household. Fulfilling this election promise will end the woes of Delhiites who are forced to install water pumps and overhead tanks to store water supplied at fixed times.

Delhi government will begin by hiring a consultant to suggest how to make 24x7 supply possible. Rubbishing claims of opposition leaders that water supply in Delhi was being privatised, Kejriwal said nothing of the sort was being done. “We promised you that like 24x7 electricity supply achieved in the last five years, we will also ensure 24x7 clean water in every household over the next five years,” the CM said. “I am glad to share we have started this process. It got delayed a bit due to Covid-19, else it would have been completed in March or April next year.”

Unlike in capitals of developed countries like London, Tokyo and Paris, water pressure in Delhi is low and requires people to install pumps to send water to overhead tanks. And when one house installs a pump, it has a cascading effect down the line, so every household is eventually forced to install pumps and water tanks. “We must bring all this to an end. Like citizens of global capitals, Delhiites too will receive 24x7 water at full pressure,” the CM assured.

Every day, around 930 million gallons of water are processed in Delhi, giving each citizen around 176 litres of water. But this volume includes all purposes, such as industrial, swimming pools, farming water, etc. “We have to increase the availability of water in Delhi, so we are in talks with the governments of UP, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and some other states that have enough water to help Delhi achieve sufficiency,” Kejriwal said.

The CM also noted that there was no accountability of the 930 MGD of current available water, some of it being pilfered or wasted through leaks. “The consultant will tell us how to rectify the water management system and ensure accountability without the wastage of even a single drop of water. We have to induct state of the art technology,” Kejriwal said.

He said there is technology where Delhi Jal Board can operate a valve remotely from a control room. The water utility’s central control room will have full information on which pipeline and which areas gets how much water, and full information on the availability of water would be available on real-time basis. “This is called the SCADA system. The consultant will tell us about this technology. It will help us move towards providing day-long supply of water to Delhiites,” the CM said.

PANAJI: Seeking an inquiry into the issuance of an electricity bill of Rs 172 for 50 days to urban development minister Milind Naik , Congress questioned how Naik’s power consumption at his official residence could be so low during Ganesh Chaturthi . It also slammed the executive electricity engineer for justifying the bill.

“An inquiry has to be conducted to find out how the minister received a bill of just Rs 172 when his entire family was staying at the bungalow,” said state Congress vice-president Sankalp Amonkar. “There are photographs showing the bungalow was fully lit during Ganesh Chaturthi, although the electrical engineer claimed there was no power load issued and the bungalow had not been occupied.”

Congress said it was inappropriate for the state to issue power bills for an official residence in the name of the minister, as the bills could be misused at a later stage. “Why should the electricity engineer offer clarification for the minister’s bill? There must also be a thorough inquiry into bills being sent to the official bungalow on a personal name,” said Amonkar.

“Doctors endured all sorts of injustice, contempt, abusive treatment for the last five months. They kept on working, only for the sake of the life of the patient affected by Covid-19 and for the purpose of social commitment that we follow,” said Nagpur IMA president Dr Archana Kothari.

“Today, it is almost impossible to run hospitals at these measly rates given by the government,” she said.

Dr Anil Laddhad said that it’s not possible to segregate the Covid and non-Covid patients in small hospitals. “Small hospitals must not be forced to keep Covid patients. This will be counterproductive and will lead to a disaster. Instead, bed strength in government institutes and big hospitals should be increased,” he said.

Doctors also requested the health minister not to appoint government employees as auditors to check hospital bills. They also raised objection against the prejudiced statements made by ministers and politicians those are insulting doctors.

Dr Sanjay Deshpande, former president IMA, said that a large number of Covid hospitals were attacked at several places. He requested that local police should file FIR and take action against the culprits immediately.

IMA had requested that the home department of Maharashtra government should inform all police stations to take action in such cases under Maharashtra Medical Services Act and the Epidemic Act 1897, Ordinance- April 2020. Till today the request has not met the terms.

Inspector of Vatva police station H V Sisara said they lodged an offence and have arrested the accused after testing him for Covid-19.

According to the FIR , on September 14, she went to the builder’s office to pay the instalment. The builder was not there and his office boy Gaurishankar was alone in the office.

The FIR states that Gaurishankar took advantage of their being alone and grabbed the complainant by her hand and pulled her towards him.

“He then touched her inappropriately. She managed to free herself and ran out of the office and went home as she was traumatized,” said Sisara.

Police sources said the victim initially thought she would forget the incident and move on but later reconsidered and lodged a complaint on Saturday.

270,['27/09/2020'],O2 beds give hotels edge over NMC-run CCCs,"Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) three Covid care centres (CCC) are having large number of vacant rooms, yet citizens are preferring private hotels which are being converted into CCCs with oxygen beds and round-the-clock medical support.

Except for oxygen facility, around 10 hotel CCCs don’t have anything additional as compared to NMC’s CCCs. The civic body-run centres too have oxygen but only for emergency use.

The NMC CCCs are free-of-cost and the medical staff is also entrusted with shifting patients who develop symptoms to hospitals. The hotels are charging around Rs6000 per day for almost similar facilities and shift patients to private dedicated hospitals with whom they have tied up.

Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said that around 10 hotels have been given permission to run CCCs. “Generally, we advise citizens to get admitted to our CCCs. But it is up to them if they wish to avail paid services. We don’t have oxygen beds at our CCCs. The private CCCs are also offering doctors, nurses and check-ups,” he said.

In July end, the administration had permitted all private hotels to start CCCs by tying up with private hospitals. The per day room rent had been fixed at Rs2,500, though it was not clear what services would be offered against the fee.

Depending on their type, private hotels are charging Rs3,500 to Rs6,000 per day which includes food, doctor and medicines charges. However, oxygen, if required is charged at Rs800 per day separately while Rs400 is additional cost for pick up and dropping of patient. The rates are higher for double occupancy.

Some hotels have leased out their properties to enterprising professionals and group of doctors who are offering a range of services. “There is no proven treatment for Covid-19. Mostly, patients are given generic drugs. People must have faith in system and avoid unnecessarily spending out of sheer panic,” a doctor posted at a CCC said.

As on Friday, only 267 patients are collectively admitted at VNIT (41), MLA Hostel (140) and Pachpaoli (86) CCCs. MLA hostel is as good as a hotel, having attached washrooms. VNIT and Pachpaoli too have newly-constructed buildings having posh rooms. In addition, the NMC’s Indira Gandhi Rughnalaya (IGR) offers around 130 oxygenated beds and has only 43 admissions.

The private CCCs have a combined capacity of over 300 beds and most of them are full. A doctor from another CCC said the NMC must run only CCC and transfer doctors and paramedics to tertiary hospitals grappling with staff shortage.

273,['27/09/2020'],Sambhajiraje rapsKMC corporators,"Kolhapur: Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje on Saturday took strong objection to a motion moved by corporators in the civic general body (GB) meeting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi denied him time for a meeting over the Maratha reservation issue.

The Rajya Sabha member’s reaction came a day after the Congress and NCP corporators moved the motion condemning the Union government for the Maratha quota fiasco, leading to the adjournment of the GB meeting.

“I would have been happier had the corporators taken a decision on more important issues like piped-gas supply,” he said..

“I can meet the PM any time. However, I want to go along with all the MPs to make it more accommodative”, said Sambhajiraje in a statement adding that the PM had not turned down any of his request for a meeting after the Supreme Court stayed the Maratha reservation.

Sambhajiraje said the PMO may have denied him time as meeting so many people is not advisable in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “I have been fighting for Maratha reservation for 14 years, but never brought politics in the issue”, he said.

The BJP and Tararani Aaghadi, meanwhile, said that “casual approach” by the Uddhav Thackeray government led to the Supreme Court bringing a stay on Maratha quota in jobs and education recently.

274,['27/09/2020'],Two states on one heritage trail,"It’s a journey made by the Buddha himself, a journey which overcame the boundaries of kingdoms. And in the centuries after the master had passed, thousands followed in his footsteps. They ranged from rulers to humble monks, from warriors seeking peace to curious pilgrims from foreign parts, such as Hiuen-Tsang. The visitors who came carried the faith back with them, spreading the word of the master beyond the mountains of the north and the oceans of the southeast, in a cultural conquest that no sword could have matched.

Perhaps in the current age, it is time for India to build on the heritage of the past and showcase this trail in a manner that benefits the citizens of today. The recent announcement by chief minister Yogi Adityanath for international flights from Kushinagar clearly indicates that the current establishment is planning on the same lines. However, the opportunity is bigger—much bigger than what just one city or one airport can throw up.

Today, there exists the never-before chance to create what might become India’s most profitable tourist circuit by leveraging global adherents of the Buddhist faith. The key pre-requisite to this will be that two states—Uttar Pradesh and Bihar—work together and create both tourist infrastructure as well as joint marketing plans to showcase this heritage to a worldwide audience.

he modern-day pilgrim’s journey could begin in the holy city of Varanasi and moving in a giant clockwise circle, culminate in Bodh Gaya in Bihar. While there can be various permutations and combinations, here is what the circuit, beginning with a landing at the international airport at Varanasi, could look like:

Sarnath is a holy spot in Buddhism. Also called Rishipatana or Mrigadaya in Buddhist archives, its current name is probably a mutation of Saranganatha which means lord of deer, coming from a deer park here. This is the place the Buddha came to, after attaining enlightenment at Bodh Gaya, and preached his first sermon to five disciples here. The event is called the ‘Dharma Chakra Pravarttana’ – turning of the Wheel of Law. The extensive complex here includes the remains of the Dharmarajika stupa as well as the Dhamekh and Chaukhandi stupa, along with numerous votive stupas and monastery remains. A site museum gives a snapshot of the place’s past.

Move next to Prayagraj, where the Allahabad Museum set in the historic Alfred Park is the best place to get a comprehensive understanding of the region’s history over time. The museum even has Buddhist remains from sites that now lie in Madhya Pradesh.

A short drive west of Prayagraj is Kaushambi, home to a massive archaeological site. Texts identify it as the seat of the Vatsa kingdom ruled by Udayana, a contemporary of the Buddha. The Buddha himself visited the city on more than one occasion, with some scholars piecing varied accounts to date at least two of these visits, to 521 and 518 BCE. An exploration of the site shows massive remains, including an Ashokan pillar.

The next leg of the journey involves a long drive northwards to Shravasti. Visitors may want to break journey at Lucknow too. Shravasti was the place where the Buddha spent many years teaching and the place bears the signs. Excavations near the village of Sahet-Mahet here have thrown up extensive remains of stupas, monasteries and more.

The road will now swing eastward towards Kushingar, where the Buddha breathed his last. This event is known as the Parinirvana and the Ramabhar stupa here is believed to have been built over the ashes of the master.

At Kushinagar, the visitor could be asked to make a choice. One option is to depart from here via the new airport. Or, if the two state governments could work together, the trip could leap into being the planet’s finest Buddhist experience. A Bihar leg would comprise an eastward journey from Kushinagar to encompass the Kesariya stupa, the extensive remains at Kolhua-Vaishali, the museums at Patna that are filled with Buddhist heritage, before going further south to the UNESCO World heritage site at Nalanda and the former Magadhan capital at Rajgir.

A swing westward would bring a visitor to Bodh Gaya, the site where the master attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree. The tree that currently stands in a vast complex here is said to be a sapling brought from Sri Lanka, from a tree that had originally been grown from a sapling taken from the original tree that was here. Gaya also has an airport which can become a departure point. There can be no better place to end this lengthy trip than a spot for enlightenment.

If the itinerary is limited to Uttar Pradesh, a traveller could spend 10 leisurely days going through the places. However, if Bihar also joins hands, this time could be doubled. Imagine a bus tour or perhaps a train like the Palace on Wheels. A small effort by the government would encourage private operators to leap into the fray too, creating more employment. Some food for thought for both governments to mull over on this World Tourism Day!

275,['27/09/2020'],Violators undeterred over ASI notice on encroachments near Golconda fort,"Hyderabad: Works on an unauthorised structure in the prohibited area near Golconda fort are in full swing. A single room is being built in violation of the rules.

Confirming the illegal construction, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials said that a notice had been served on the trespasser, but the notices were serving no purpose as the encroachers seem to be having a field day.

“We are identifying at least 10 such unauthorised constructions in the prohibited area of the fort every month. We issue red (show-cause) notices promptly, but they (encroachers) ignore them,” an official at the fort told TOI.

Expressing distress on numerous encroachments springing up in and around the fort, the official said individual habitations and commercial units dot the fort’s ramparts. “The fort’s marvellous grandeur is shrinking gradually,” he rued.

Officials said unauthorised constructions can be seen on three major entries leading to the fort — Fateh darwaza (east side to the fort), Moti darwaza (north side) and Banjara darwaza (north-east side). “Even narrow stretches en route to the fort are not spared by these trespassers,” he added.

In another violation, an unauthorised construction is coming up near Masqati lane at Charminar. Sources said officials had already served a notice over it. TOI obtained a copy of the show-cause notice through an RTI application. Citing Rule 33 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) 1959 Act, the ASI identified the structure as an unauthorised structure.

When asked about measures to control the encroachments in and around ASI-protected sites, superintending archaeologist, ASI, Hyderabad circle, Milan Kumar Chauley said they are keeping a vigil at Golconda and Charminar areas. “We are issuing notices and stepping up efforts,” he added.

276,['27/09/2020'],"Decline in city deaths, but experts say Covid curve not flattening yet","Nagpur: On the cusp of 2,000 Covid deaths, the city has started to witness a decline in the number of fatalities and fatality rate (number of deaths against positive cases).

As per the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) data, there were 18 Covid deaths on Saturday. This is the lowest single day spike since 13 deaths were registered on August 13. On Saturday, the fatalities till date was 1,999.

From March to July, there were 83 deaths and 3,645 positive cases for a CFR of 2.27%. By end of August, total deaths were 960, positive cases 26,593 and CFR 3.6%.

The CFR only for August was the highest at 3.82% as city recorded 877 deaths and 22,948 positive cases. The daily average of deaths was 28 and positive cases 740.

Between September 1 and 7, there were 336 deaths for a daily average of 48. The CFR was 3.68% as positive cases were 9,120 for a daily average of 1,303.

September 8 to 14 saw a slight reduction in deaths. There were 293 deaths and positive cases were 9,150 for a CFR of 3.20%. The daily average of fatalities was 42 and positive cases 1,307.

The trend of decline in deaths continued between September 15-21. It was 266. Positive cases were 8,618 and the CFR 3.08%. The daily average was 38 deaths and 1,231 positive cases.

In the last five days, the number of deaths was 41, 36, 25, 24 and 18 for a total of 144. The daily average was 29 fatalities. Positive cases were 5,699 for a daily average of 1,140. Thus, the CFR of last five days was 2.52%.

The city’s overall CFR was 3.37% as on Saturday (deaths 1,999, positive cases 59,150) because of high CFR in August and two weeks of September.

Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar and infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde feel that decline in deaths and CFR cannot be considered as flattening of curve and that the data will have to be monitored for another 15 days.

“Positivity rate is yet to go down. We seem to be on a plateau now. The scenario is likely to be clear in the next three weeks,” said Dr Shinde.

NMC’s additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI that declining deaths is a good sign. “The reasons could be that symptomatic patients started to get beds in hospitals, comorbid reporting early to hospitals and so on. The number of positive patients going down is probably due to decline in number of tests. On Saturday, we planned few things for increasing the tests. If positive cases increase, then CFR will decline to a great extent,” he said.

As against the daily average testing of 3,096 in August, testing increased to 6,811 in September 1-7 and 10,261 in September 8-14. It reduced to 6,598/day during September 15-21. The daily average testing of last five days was 5,308.

Joshi said that the number of people visiting NMC testing centres and UPHCs “are declining”. “We will now reach out to people to get more tests done,” he said.

The civil surgeon’s data has only 1,711 deaths. As reported by TOI on Friday, the CS has started to do reconciliation and bring data on par with NMC. Though he has matched the positive cases and recoveries, there is a difference in deaths (288).

277,['27/09/2020'],"Hotelier sedated, raped by prospective employer","Representative image

AHMEDABAD: A hotelier from Rajasthan who came looking for a job in Ahmedabad has accused a city transporter of sedating and raping her. The woman, 28, is currently a Sola resident. She lodged a complaint on Saturday stating that Suresh Jat of Narol spiked her cold drink and raped her after she fell unconscious. Inspector S A Gohil of the Narol police station said that the accused has been sent for the pre-arrest Covid test.

According to the complainant, who has a PhD, she and her husband used to run a hotel in Rajasthan. The lockdown forced them to close down the business. The FIR said the couple came to Ahmedabad in search of work and have been staying in Sola for the past 15 days. The complainant mentioned in the FIR that she had earlier come to Ahmedabad for a business summit.

“Jat met her in that period. He said he runs a transport business and gave his number to the complainant,” said a police source. “Jat asked her to call him if she needed a good job. In the time of crisis, the complainant got in touch with him.” Jat called her to his office in Narol with documents on Friday evening. According to the FIR, Jat led her into his office, checked her documents, and offered a cold drink.

“The complainant has alleged that after having the drink, she felt giddy and eventually fell unconscious,” the police source said. “When she regained consciousness, she found that her shirt was unbuttoned and her jeans was pulled down to her knees. She said that she was bleeding from her private parts. She mustered strength and went home.” The FIR said that the woman told her husband what Jat had done and on Saturday lodged a complaint.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

The time period for construction is three years but the work could be completed even earlier,” Jawalkar said.

Every hour, more than 1000 persons would be able to take the ropeway, which is being constructed at a cost of Rs 300 crores, Jawalkar said. A parking facility, which can accommodate up to 1,500 vehicles, is also being constructed at Purkul – the proposed starting point of the ropeway.

“The project is being done on a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) mode. The private firm involved in the construction will get a 17.5% share in the revenue generated by the ropeway. An agreement for 30 years – extendable by 20 years – has been entered into with the firm,” the secretary said.

Once ready, the ropeway will not only be a major tourist attraction but is also expected to relieve traffic on the Dehradun-Mussoorie road.

On Saturday, Jawalkar also visited George Everest house at Hathipaon, which the tourism department is developing as a cartographic museum, in partnership with Asian Development Bank (ADB).

“We are developing a cartographic museum along with an open theatre, heritage trek, log huts and stargazing domes at this site at a cost of Rs 24 crore,” Jawalkar said.

Sir George Everest, who served as Surveyor General of India, measured the Great Meridional Arc from Kanyakumari to the Himalayas. The world's highest mountain peak (Mount Everest) is named after him. He owned the house and observatory at this place (about 7 km from Mussoorie ) from 1832 to 1843.

Police told a local court that Patil procured the gun, used to kill the jeweller, from Bihar along with the other accused.

Crime branch sleuths stated that when Rodrigues was in Delhi and in need of money, he contacted the other two accused and disclosed his plans to loot jewellery shops in Goa using the deadly weapon.

On June 30, 2020, Rodrigues booked two airlines tickets for his accomplices to Delhi. From Delhi they flew to Bihar and procured the gun. Patil and Shaikh then had firing practices with the gun, the investigation agency said.

Rodrigues came down to Goa on July 28 and resided in Panaji at some premises taken on rent by Omkar.

After surveying jeweller shops in Margao, they zeroed in on ‘Krishni jeweller’ as they saw Walke sitting alone in the shop.

Few days prior to the commission of the crime, one of them had entered the shop to view the interiors, police informed the court.

After commission of the crime, Rodrigues and the bail applicant, Patil, burnt the blood-stained clothes of Shaikh and Rodrigues at Dona Paula to destroy evidence. The knife was also recovered following the statement made by the applicant.

On September 2, Shaikh entered the shop, shot and stabbed Walke in a bid to commit robbery and escaped.

Police have booked the accused under sections 302, 398, 201 read with 120-B of the Indian Penal Code and sections 3 and 25 of the Arms Act.Post-mortem report has revealed that the victim suffered 21 brutal injuries including entry and exit gunshot wounds, nine stab wounds and 11 abrasions and bruises.

The arguments in the case will be heard on October 1 as the defence lawyer sought time.

Gandhi said in her complaint that Chirag Purohit of Paldi and Ashok Parmar of Raikhad duped her of the money under the pretext of helping her buy a house in Paldi. Ellisbridge police sources said that they have lodged a complaint of cheating and are searching for the accused. Gandhi said in her FIR that her husband had died of cancer in 2006.

She said that in February 2016, Purohit came to her house and offered to help her buy a flat. “Purohit showed her some flats to win her trust and later asked her for money to seal the sale,” a police official said. “She gave four cheques to Purohit. He gave her nothing in return.” Gandhi flew to Canada in May 2016. On her son’s instruction, she came back to India in 2019 and asked Purohit for the money. He gave her some cheques; all of them bounced.

At the time, Gandhi had filed an application of complaint against Purohit at the Ellisbridge police station. But Parmar stepped in to broker a compromise. She then undertook another trip to Canada. On her return, Purohit and Parmar made more promises but gave no money back.

282,['27/09/2020'],"Diabetic, high BP, obese, above 51? You are in Covid danger zone","Nagpur: Diabetes and hyper tension are the biggest causes of Covid deaths. An analysis by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) of toll due to comorbidities reveal that 77% had these two diseases.

Also, 26% of the deceased were brought dead and passed away within 24 hours of hospitalization in Covid hospitals.

The civic body has analysed 904 Covid deaths between August 31 and September 20. 723 (80%) were comorbid and 181 (20%) had no comorbidities. Among the comorbid, 278 (38.45%) were patients of diabetes and hyper tension. 199 (28%) of the deceased had diabetes and 32 had hyper tension (4.43%).

33 (4.56%) of the deceased were patients of asthma with diabetes or hyper tension, or both. Similarly, 15 (2%) deceased had kidney-related diseases along with diabetes or hyper tension, or both.

Intensivist Dr Nikhil Balankhe told TOI that most of the deceased might have had obesity. “The chances of saving a Covid patient with diabetes and hyper tension with obesity is very less, especially if they are hospitalized late. The number of asthma patients contracting Covid might be higher, but it claims fewer victims. Immunity level and resistance of patients with diabetic and hyper tension is very low. Therefore, infection spreads rapidly,” he said.

Those with diabetes, hyper tension and obesity need to take more care.

“They should compulsorily test and report to hospital on Day-1 of symptoms and also if oxygen saturation level is below 93. Hospitals should give priority admission as well as take extra care of such patients,” said Dr Balankhe.

Along with comorbidities, 82.96% of the total deceased were in the age group of above 51 years.

Out of 904 deaths, the NMC could get details of admission of 518 deceased in hospitals from the time they first showed symptoms. 125 (24.13%) had reported after five days while 203 (39.19%) within 2-5 days and 190 (36.67%) within 1 day.

The civic body could get details of hospitalization of 631 deaths only. 68 (10.77%) were brought dead, 98 (15.53%) died within a day, 231 (36.60%) within 2-5 days and 234 (37.1%) after more than five days.

The NMC’s analysis also revealed that 468 (51.77%) had visited private hospitals, clinics and taken treatment for an average of three days before testing for Covid. “Private facilities did not inform about these patients to NMC,” the report pointed out.

228 (25.23%) deceased had visited hospitals run by government and NMC. 208 (23%) had not visited any hospital.

833 (92.14%) of the deceased, most of who were above 51 years and comorbid, contracted the virus from outside their families.

The authorities had constantly asked those with comorbidities not to leave their homes.

There is also a change in zone-wise deaths. In the initial stage, deaths were reported only from Gandhibagh and Satranjipura zones.

In August, the deaths were higher in Ashinagar and Gandhibagh zones. This time, the highest deaths were from Hanuman Nagar followed by Mangalwari and Nehru Nagar zones.

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma have directed all zones to also undertake analysis of Covid-19 deaths at their levels to identify reasons and chalk out measures to control the fatalities.

283,['27/09/2020'],"It’s not a title suit like Ayodhya, says petitioner in Mathura case","LUCKNOW: Ranjana Aginhotri, the ‘next friend’ of Bhagwan Shrikrishna Virajman, who filed the civil suit in a Mathura court on Friday claiming the ownership of the entire 13.37 acre of Krishna Janmabhoomi land in the temple town and the removal of Shahi Idgah Masjid, feels that this suit may not be as “challenging” as the Ayodhya’s title suit.

“No ownership has to be decided here. This is not a title suit,” Agnihotri, one of the plaintiffs in the suit, told TOI, adding “Our plea is for removing encroachment.” She is not new to such suits. A veteran lawyer, based in Lucknow, she represented Hindu Mahasabha in Ayodhya title suit both in high court and the Supreme Court.

When asked about the SC shutting the door for fresh litigation to alter the status quo of sites such as Kashi and Mathura after the Ayodhya verdict in November last year, her advocate HS Jain said, “SC ne aisa koi order nahin diya hai. Media reported wrongly. (SC passed no such order).”

As per the petition, up to 2 bighas of land at Katra Keshav Dev has been encroached upon by the Committee of Management Alleged Trust Masjid Idgah and UP Sunni Central Waqf Board. A “superstructure” has been illegally built at the place.

“We are seeking removal of encroachment and superstructure from Shrikrishna Janmabhoomi. It should not be difficult,” Jain said.

He denied that the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, (which barred courts from entertaining litigation that would alter the status quo of religious places as it existed in 1947) will come in the way of the suit. “The superstructure was illegally raised after a compromise was reached between Shrikrishna Janma Sthan Sewa Sansthan and Committee of Management of Masjid Idgah in 1968.”

“We have provided enough proof to say how the temple was demolished during Aurangzeb’s reign and rebuilt later. And, how the mosque was broken by Marathas in 1770 and then came up after 1968.”

The Mathura suit has been moved through Agnihotri and six other devotees to ‘reclaim the entire 13.37 acre land at Katra Keshav Dev, Mathura’ which, they claim, belongs to Shrikrishna Virajman, the deity.

PANAJI: Despite facing tough times during the pandemic, the Small and Medium Hoteliers’ Association of Goa has decided to celebrate the World Tourism Day by reaching out to those in need.

The association is getting its members to contribute to help needy students looking to study and enter the tourism industry .

Till date, 11 members of the association have contributed towards the scholarship programme and more are expected to join in.

“Some local students who passed SSC are facing financial difficulties in pursuing their ambition to enter the tourism industry in Goa. The members of the association are getting together to sponsor students for the hotel management course conducted by Don Bosco Vocational Training Institute, Quepem ,” association president Serafino Cota said.

“If this goes well, we will also provide scholarships to those who want to do the short diploma course in nursing as nurses are the need of the hour,” he added.

“Instead of regular activities like beach cleaning and tree plantation drive, and despite facing difficulties in paying salaries to staff, loans, electricity bills , etc, we decided to celebrate World Tourism Day by giving back,” he added.

Meanwhile, the association met tourism secretary Ashok Kumar on Friday to press for a crackdown in illegal tourism by unregistered guest houses operating from gated communities.

The association has proposed that gated community operators (Second home) be given B Category registration as the government is losing revenue on electricity, water, GST and pollution fees as they are not treated as commercial billing.

In various representations to the chief minister and government this month, the association has called for a tourism tribunal to address grievances from service providers in the industry as well as complaints from civil society and where necessary provide a temporary resolution within 24 hours.

The association has also asked for a 50% reduction in excise license fee which has been increased to Rs 60,000 from Rs 13,000 and also for a single window clearance with long term certificate of registration and trade license issued for five years.

289,['27/09/2020'],Health dept on the hunt for intensivists in Ekm dist,"Shortage of specialists in ICUs looms during critical time

Kochi: With the daily surge in Covid-19 cases, the health department is staring at a shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) specialists, who play a critical role in treating seriously ill patients. The looming scenario forced authorities to initiate a hunt for specialists (medical intensivists), and they even approached private hospitals. The response was underwhelming. Now, the department has invited applications from qualified medical practitioners. Speedy appointments and free accommodation for two years are some of the perks being dangled to lure qualified personnel.

Kalamassery Medical College Hospital has five specialists and PVS three. “We need three more intensivists for both Covid hospitals as their services will be necessary when cases rise in the future. We have approached private hospitals in this regard. The service of intensivists is necessary in both the private and government sector. We have trained qualified people in many other sectors,” said Dr Mathew Numpeli, NHM district programme officer.

Shortage of intensivists is a problem that is likely to weigh down the health system when cases surge further in the district. Intensivists observe critically ill patients in ICUs and take decisions on their course and levels of treatment. Specialists in tertiary-care hospitals say intensivists are already overburdened as manpower is divvied up between treatment of Covid and general patients.

“In proportion to Covid cases reported every day, the number of patients requiring ICU admission is very small. Problems arise when each patient will have to undergo treatment for two to three weeks at a critical-care unit. The number of patients in ICU will accumulate suddenly in such scenarios, raising the burden on critical-care treatment,” said Dr T V Sreevalsan, senior consultant and head of critical care medicine at Lisie Hospital.

“Each intensivist can treat six to eight patients a day, ” said Dr Sreevalsan.

290,['27/09/2020'],Gate tiff: Corporation warns of more action; RWAs cite safety,"South Delhi Municipal Corporation

NEW DELHI: A day after South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) demolished eight gates in Safdarjung Enclave and Green Park Extension , the civic agency on Saturday said that notices would also be issued to other colonies asking them to follow norms.

“We will do a survey of other areas and issue notices to RWAs/residents to obtain permission from the traffic police and NOC from the fire department. If norms are still not followed, gates will be removed from other colonies as well. Also, it will be ensured that the colony gates remain open for the general public during daytime,” said an SDMC official.

“In case of the two neighbourhoods, the matter was discussed with the residents before taking the action. Some residents had earlier complained about the gates remaining closed during the daytime,” the official added.

On Saturday, the Green Park Extension RWA members met the deputy commissioner, south zone. “We were never served the notices. We demanded a copy of complaints (without mentioning residents’ names) but those were also not shared. How can we believe them ? One of SDMC’s officials asserted that they were not bound to serve us notice or share a copy of complaints with RWA, something we immediately raised objection to,” said Neha Puri, general secretary of Green Park Extension RWA.

“We had installed the gates on residents’ demand and none of them were on the main road,” she added.

RWAs across south Delhi, meanwhile, said that colony gates are necessary to avoid unchecked entry of outsiders and contain the spread of Covid-19. “There are lakhs of such gates in the city and majority of them did not require any permission. If they are removed, it will only increase law and order problems. In our area also, the gates were installed 40 years back after a police initiative ‘Neighbourhood watch’ was introduced,” said Panakj Agarwal, resident of Safdarjung Enclave. He added that on Saturday, SDMC officials asked them to remove three more gates.

MK Gupta of Greater Kailash-I S-Block said that SDMC seldom responds to complaints of encroachment, pruning or cleaning backlanes, but when it comes to taking action against some good work done by RWAs, it immediately reacts.

PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has issued notice to the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change on a PIL challenging a recent amendment made to the CRZ Notification 2011, to protect khazan lands that are unique to Goa.

Filed by the NGO Goa Foundation, the PIL states that the amendment, which gives protection to the mangroves within khazan lands, will effectively destroy the khazans. It says destruction will occur “unless it is clarified to mean protection for only those mangroves outside khazan bunds on the seaward side and not the mangroves within the khazans as stated in the amendment”.

The petitioner has sought deletion of only a part of the clause in the amendment to the CRZ notification on the grounds that it is contrary to the objectives of the notification itself.

The PIL claims that mangroves within khazans are a result of mismanagement of the embankments and sluice gates and are therefore an undesirable development. It, however, does not challenge the definition of the HTL in the state of Goa, introduced by the same amendment.

“The protection of the khazan system and its embankments is a mandatory requirement in view of climate change and expected sea level rise ,” Goa Foundation director Claude Alvares , said.

AHMEDABAD: The nostalgia creeps up each time one passes by Law Garden bazaar, a place which this time of the year used to be bustling with enthusiasts piling up on each other for their choicest jewellery, turbans, and traditional wear for the nine-day revelry.

The streets now bear a deserted look with practically no buyers for the Navratri paraphernalia . On Saturday, even the Gujarat government announced that it plans to cancel the October 17-25 Navratri events this year. The government in an official release has stated that they do not desire another round of pandemic boost.

What came as a double whammy to artisans of traditional wear sellers at Law Garden was that a police patrol instructed them to shut after 6pm. This has never happened in several decades. “As such there has not been any sale this week. And now the police is forcing us to shut shop,” says Geeta Soni , one of the agents who sell traditional wear at the law garden market. Even event organizers are withholding events. After Karnavati and Rajpath clubs called off the events, there is not much to expect.

Himanshu Shah of SOI Events says, “As such advertising and sponsorships have been dwindling over the past few years. This year, many sponsors had no budget for outdoor events. There is lot of reluctance. In this environment , it is better to keep off from events this year.”

Bhargav K a software engineer and a garba enthusiast has never missed Navratri in a decade. “Public health comes first. I or anybody could be passive carriers of the disease, we don’t want such events to put the lives of people with co-morbidities or other health vulnerabilities at risk. This is the time to be empathetic towards others.” He has welcomed the state government’s decision to call off its event. “I will surely miss Navratri this year.”

Nishant Makwana, a pharmacist welcomed the state government’s decision of cancelling the events and said, “For me and other colleagues, this is the first time we wouldn’t be asking for Navratri leaves.”

Recently, Kondapochamma Sagar was in the news for trashed being spewed by visitors there, raising renewed concerns about keeping tourist destinations clean.

The Kondapochamma reservoir is among the new travel destinations that several residents flocked during the lockdown. Located in in Markook mandal of Siddipet district, it is about 45 km from the city. Nagesh Reddy, an IT employee who headed to the reservoir recently, said: “There were plastic cups and plates everywhere. I went on a weekend and was surprised that there were so many people, not many bothered about basic cleanliness.”

Ragini Kasarla, who went to the Fakhruddingutta rock formations, had a similar experience. “The hillock is scenic, but there are no dustbins for people to discard waste. People were enjoying a picnic at the spot, but leaving behind trash.”

The call to maintain cleanliness comes even as the tourism industry faces one of its hardest battles to woo back visitors. Leading travel and tourism associations of India have also come together to appeal to authorities to strengthen the packaging waste collection and recycling ecosystem.

Pronab Sarkar, president of Indian Association of Tour Operators said, “Tourism sector is the key for the revival of Indian economy and cleanliness will play a pivotal role in the post-Covid era to attract tourists. Tourists will seek destinations that are safe, hygienic, and clean. Pollution with respect to tourism encompasses air emissions, noise, solid waste and littering, release of sewage, and chemicals, even architectural/visual pollution. Most of these are easily avoidable.”

Subhash Goyal, honorary secretary of Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism & Hospitality (FAITH) said, “The pandemic has made us realize that the health of our planet is the priority. Collective efforts, not only by the government and municipalities but by all individuals, social, voluntary organizations and resident welfare associations have to be made to curtail littering and improve waste collection and recycling efforts.”

It added that while the national growth rate of the economy in 2019-20 was 4.2%, it was 4.3 % in Uttarakhand.

According to official data, the state outperformed the average of the nation in per capita income. The national per capita income was Rs 1.15 lakh in 2017-18, Rs 1.26 lakh in 2018-19, and Rs 1.34 lakh in 2019-20. Meanwhile, the per capita income of Uttarakhand was Rs 1.80 lakh in 2017-18, Rs 1.91 lakh in 2018-19, and Rs 2.02 lakh in 2019-20.

Similarly, on comparing the national average growth rate with that of Uttarakhand, it was found that the hill state has performed better in this area as well. The national economy growth rate was 7.2% in 2017-18, 6.1% in 2018-19, and 4.2% in 2019-20. On the other hand, the Uttarakhand economy growth rate was 7.9% in 2017-18, 5.8% in 2018-19, and 4.3% in 2019-20.

Notably, Uttarakhand suffered the sharpest year-on-year fall of 42% in GST collections in the March-July period, data released recently in the Lok Sabha had said. A possible reason for Uttarakhand’s massive dip in GST is anticipated to be the lockdown and the recession that followed which coincided with the state’s peak tourism season.

Urban development minister and state government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said, “There is no denying the fact that Covid-19 had impacted our economy and we were hit comparatively more as Uttarakhand is a tourism-based economy. Tourism forms the financial backbone of the state and with tourists not coming during the peak season, the impact was visible economy-wise. However, things are coming back to shape and we are confident of a good performance in the next few months.”

303,['27/09/2020'],UP: Purvanchal Expressway to be open for public in January,"More than 60% construction work has already been completed

LUCKNOW: The 341-km Purvanchal Expressway is most likely to be dedicated to the public in January next year when its carriageway is thrown open for traffic. After a review meeting on Friday, UPEIDA CEO Awanish Awasthi said that not only the carriageway would start from January, but all the tolls booths would also be functional from April.

The expressway, to be constructed at a cost of Rs 22,000 crore and considered the longest in the country so far (the proposed Ganga Expressway between Meerut and Prayagraj would be around 600 km), will connect Ghazipur with the state capital. It will pass through nine districts -- Lucknow, Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Ambedkar Nagar, Azamgarh , Mau and Ghazipur. It will also have a passage to Gorakhpur through a 95-km link expressway.

If one takes into account Yamuna Expressway and Agra-Lucknow Expressway as well, the three super highways would provide a seamless connectivity between Delhi and the eastern corner of Uttar Pradesh and also Bihar. More than 60% construction work has already been completed and Awasthi is confident that it would be over in time. Earlier, the expressway was to be inaugurated on Diwali, but Covid-induced lockdown delayed the launch.

The speedy completion of the Purvanchal Expressway has already increased the 'value' of Agra-Lucknow Expressway and the toll bid has doubled to Rs 402 crore this time as compared to Rs 200 crore last time, Awasthi told TOI. ""These expressways would be the most preferable mode for those coming from Delhi and going towards said eastern UP. That's why the toll bid has doubled,"" he explained.

It has been decided to test all symptomatic and vulnerable people who are contacts of positive cases.To create awareness and encourage symptomatic people to come forward for testing, services of rapid response teams (RRT) have been constituted at ward levels in each local body. Asymptomatic primary contacts of the positive cases will not be tested. But they will have to undergo mandatory 14 days quarantine.Health officials said the new move is to strengthen symptom surveillance, failure of which will lead to deterioration of the condition of patients and increase mortality rate. “Already family healthcare, community health centres, taluk, district, general and private hospitals have been equipped with antigen test kits. Irrespective of contact history, all symptomatic people will be tested. Besides co-morbid people, children, elderly and the pregnant that are primary contacts will also be tested. Priority is to provide treatment in the early stage and arrange ICU facilities for critically ill patients.Testing all of them and then treating severe cases won’t be a judicious decision. Our resources are limited,” said a district health official. Another district health officer said that many are not turning up. “If we call 10 people for testing, only a few are turning up. Others switch off their phones. We seek help of local body members to trace the symptomatic.” Symptom surveillance has come down in the district as many health workers have been posted for data entry work especially in periphery of Ernakulam.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78344559,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-65846,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ernakulam-changes-testing-strategy-as-cases-shoot-up/articleshow/78339892.cms

The Pundaliknagar police of Aurangabad city arrested 32-year-old Nashik resident Bablu Ingle and Akash Pagde, a 25-year-old from Aurangabad. Police said the suspects had confessed to starting the spa as a partnership firm, but using it for flesh trade.

A team led by assistant inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne led the raid.

“The rescued women from Nagaland revealed that they were brought to Aurangabad on the pretext of a job at the spa and were later forced into the flesh trade,” Sonawne told TOI.

These women have been staying in the city for over nine months, while two 21-year-old women from the city were trapped only about a month ago.

The rescued women have been produced before the women and child welfare committee and sent to the correctional home.

Police said the suspects operated the racket by circulating their contact numbers through social media. When anyone contacted the given number, the spa employees would offer body massage service. They would mention the flesh trade only after the customer reached the centre.

“Since long, the issue of providing jobs to tribals on the non-reserved category is going on. The tribal youths have been registering protest for the last 18 days and it was in the knowledge of local administration. It is hard to believe that police failed to sense the protesters’ move,” said Kataria.

He asked CM Ashok Gehlot to take strict action against the protesters who committed arson and looting in the area. “If the administration fails to act on time, it is going to create social disharmony in the region,” said Kataria. He also urged the tribal youths to follow a constitutional method to resolve the issue, as violence is not acceptable.

Meanwhile, state BJP has formed a three-member committee to examine the issue in Dungarpur and submit the report to the BJP state president Satish Poonia . State general secretary Madan Dilawar , MP Chittorgarh CP Joshi and MP Udaipur Arjun Lal Meena are the committee members.

Sangariya SHO Inder Kumar said, “The FSL report is still awaited, but we are trying out all possible ways to find the accused and recover the money. For the same, we have sent teams to neighbouring states to investigate.”

On the day of the incident, the accused entered the bank and threatened the security guard as well as another employee with weapons following which they took the cash from the locker and locked the two individuals inside the vault. The accused made their escape in a vehicle used by the bank.

309,['27/09/2020'],‘Wildlife tourism during Covid will be an eye opener’,"Naturalist Himanshu Bagde (42) started his career in sales and marketing in a multinational organization but quit his job in 2009 to pursue his passion of forest and tigers. Bagde has sighted over 500 tigers in the jungles of India over the last 25 years. He chose to follow his passion of becoming a ‘tiger trailer’, a wildlife photographer, a nature guide, and now a wildlife tourism consultant and an environmental conservationist.With wildlife parks opening from October 1, TOI talked to him about tourism during Covid-19 times. September 27 is also celebrated as World Tourism Day.Excerpts from an interview ...Q. Wildlife parks are opening from October 1. What is uppermost on tourists’ minds?A. Domestic tourists, professional photographers and others related to nature staying within a 300km radius and nearby cities and those who can travel by road will surely keep the date. There are a lot of apprehensions due to Covid and I think this will affect the psyche of people visiting. The ones who stay nearby will go for safaris. Tourists who travel from metro cities and other parts of the country too would be apprehensive to check-in at resorts and it is likely that they will skip their travel plans for the holidays. Professionals like photographers and other scientific communities will take this risk and visit the park since it is their profession. Owing to travel restrictions, chances of foreign tourists visiting parks are bleak, at least till there is a considerable respite from the pandemic in the origin country as well as India.Q. What is the situation in other most-sought-after tiger reserves?A. Lockdowns were absolutely necessary but, as a tour consultant, I can say that Covid has wiped out tourism business for tour operators, resort owners and those living around the park who are completely dependent on it. The losses were huge but everyone is supporting each other to survive. We thought that before October everything will be back to normal, but with cases flaring up it appears that normalcy in any tiger reserve is a distant dream. Confidence of tourists is at an all-time low, travel arrangements are not at par and further insecurities surrounding stay at hotels and resorts make things difficult.Q. With Covid-19 at its peak, how can tourists and animals remain safe?A: Tourists have no other choice than to follow distancing norms for their own safety. Existing safari rules are very strict which makes sure that man and animal do not come close. Tourists will have to be more disciplined and should not spit anywhere. Guides and drivers in Vidarbha have a habit to consume ‘kharra’ and spit in the open. Parks will have to ensure urinals, which are usually in bad shape, are sanitized. Maintaining hygiene should be the park’s top priority. If all precautions are taken by tourists and park management, the risks for both tourists and animals will be minimized.Q. When corona is spreading alarmingly, is it wise to open the parks?A. I think we have to learn to live with this pandemic till the vaccines are out. Everyone develops antibodies to endure this virus. So, we cannot close everything and sit quiet. To what extent should we rely on the government to support us? Therefore, it is a bold and good decision to open the parks. Once a few people visit parks and share their experiences, others will develop confidence and this sector may witness revival soon. The bottom line is that we have to be strict while following Covid-19 guidelines.Q. Are foreign tourists visiting or showing interest?A. Tourist visas are not being issued. So, foreigners will be unable to visit the parks at least until February next year. Very few are taking special permissions and making travel arrangements.Q. Do you think NTCA diktat on the number of visitors will affect tourism?A. NTCA has a primary role to play for tiger conservation. Ever since the pandemic has engulfed the country, it is also worried about Covid-19 spread. Though the restrictions are from the ministry of home affairs (MHA), I strongly feel NTCA should push for allowing six persons in one safari vehicle if they belong to the same family. In Madhya Pradesh, online bookings can be done for six persons. I also feel restriction on children below 10 and above 65 years for safari should be removed. This will affect domestic tourism flow in parks.Q. Are our parks equipped to take on the Covid-19 spread?A. Parks have to gear up with basic amenities required to safeguard from spreading the virus. There are few initiatives like the use of sanitizers and tyre bath that have been taken up by the authorities to tackle the situation.Q. In Covid-19 times, how should wildlife tourism be viewed?A. Wildlife tourism, especially in testing times like Covid, will be an eye-opener in the real sense. Tourists will realize how things in nature go on regardless of no emergencies there. Humans due to multiple reasons have destroyed our nature and therefore we are in trouble. Looking to wildlife and nature may prompt humans to act proactively to conserve nature. Here no one asks you to let go of your economic interests but we just ask you to conserve nature. Ecotourism is the only thing that can be done without harming nature.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78340961,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-113587,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wildlife-tourism-during-covid-will-be-an-eye-opener/articleshow/78340962.cms

Police have registered cases against the five, three of whim had been stealing water for their stone cutting units, one for his under-construction marriage palace and the other was found storing water in a huge underground water tank for selling.

This operation was carried out jointly by Jodhpur Military Intelligence, Garrison Engineer (MES) and police on Saturday following a complaint of low pressure of water at the station.

According to police, a garrison engineer had checked a 15 km pipeline meant to supply water to the military station at Banar after repeated complaints of low water pressure.

“On checking, they found water being pilfered from the pipeline at five places by connecting PVC pipes to this high pressure main supply line,” police said. All the connections were removed and points were sealed by the MES.

According to sources, though it appeared a simple case of water theft, it can have serious repercussions if civilians have such easy access to resources meant for military use.

313,['27/09/2020'],Restore promotions of 896 PAC constables: UP CM Yogi Adityanath,"UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath

LUCKNOW: Taking serious note of a recent decision by the UP Police to demote 896 PAC constables who had earlier been promoted while on deputation to the civil police, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed the state police chief to immediately restore their promotions.

The CM also expressed his displeasure over the manner in which the PAC brass decided to recall these jawans from deputation and cancel their promotions that were awarded during their service in the civil police. He also instructed the DGP to fix the responsibility of the officers who carried out such an exercise without informing the state government.

Director General of Police Hitesh Chandra Awasthy told TOI that he had already instructed the ADG, PAC, to restore the promotions of the constables who returned to their parent cadre from the civil police depending upon vacancies and following all the procedures.

In November 2019, during a review of non-gazetted ranks' promotions in civil police, a four-member committee found that 910 of them belonged to the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC).

In November 2019, during a review of non-gazetted ranks' promotions in civil police, a four-member committee found that 910 of them belonged to the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC). The panel found that they had been shifted to the civil police on deputation and were given promotions in due course of time.

In all, 932 constables from PAC were found working in the civil police: 910 of them were promoted while the remaining 22 remained constable even in the civil police. As many as 890 out of these 910 were promoted as head constables while six were promoted to the rank of sub-inspector. Remaining 14 either retired or passed away after promotions.

Senior police officials at the establishment board said that there are two ways of recruitment in non-gazetted ranks, one is constable in civil police and the other is constable in PAC. “Both have separate exams and are separate cadres. But after 2008, there was a proper system of transfer from one cadre to the other,” they said.

Civil police often takes help of PAC jawans in various duties and over a period of time, they become part and parcel of the civil police. But technically they are not part of the civil police and should not consider them so, he clarified.

However, these PAC jawans had been given promotions in the civil police after due course of time. ""It was not their fault that they had been promoted in another cadre. They earned it. That's why the CM ordered the restoration,"" said a government spokesperson.

316,['27/09/2020'],Cong launches online campaign against farm bills,"Jaipur: The Congress leaders on Saturday launched an online campaign — #SpeakUpForFarmers — deploring the three farm bills passed in Parliament.

PCC president Govid Singh Dotasra and former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot described the legislation as ‘black laws’ passed in undemocratic way. The party campaign trended at the national level.

The Modi government passed three anti-farmer bills. All three bills will weaken the farmer. These bills are a conspiracy to hand over the produce of the farmer to the big capitalists, said Dotasra.

Accusing the central government of betraying farmers, Pilot on Saturday asked how will the Centre pacify farmers about the farm bills when it failed to convince its own minister. He demanded that the Centre withdraw the three bills in the interest of farmers.

“The central government should admit its mistake and withdraw the bills. The way the bills were passed... pushed in the Rajya Sabha was undemocratic. Therefore, dissenting voices are emerging in the country today ,” Pilot said in a video message. He said that a Union minister from NDA’s ally resigned from the Cabinet over the issue.

He said that BJP’s promise to double the farmers’ income has been sidestepped and the farmers have been badly hit. The Congress leader said that the bills were introduced hurriedly, without consulting the states and farmers. “We all want investment and reforms, but these bills are anti-farmer and anti-national,” he said.

Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said the leaders of the BJP are cheating the farmers by lying on the Kisan Bill.

Khachariyawas alleged that BJP leaders are playing in the hands of industrialists. The whole country knows about demonetisation, privatisation of rail, GST, privatisation of airports and BSNL, crude oil despite being cheap in the international market, is the most expensive in the country.

Mahendra Chaudhary, Congress deputy chief whip in the assembly, in a video alleged that, “BJP is anti-farmer party. The is Centre bent on ruining farmers.” He asked why not talk about MSP in law? It is part of a conspiracy to mortgage farmers’ land to the capitalists. The Modi government must withdraw all three bills immediately, he said.

Batting for the new reforms in the agriculture sector, union minister of state for agriculture Kailesh Choudhary on Saturday says that bills passed in both the houses of the parliament will bring a transformational change in the lives of the farmers. In a presser held at Jaipur, he says that farmers will get an option to sell their produce anywhere will give them the freedom from the Mandi system. “The farmers' community can now get the actual price of their produce. The buyers can give them the price according to the produce leaving no scope for the middlemen in the new system,” said Choudhary.

Khaunte also said the outburst by Goa Industrial Development Corporation chairman Glenn Ticlo and Goa State Industries Association president Damodar Kochkar, has proved how frustrated people are with the state regime.

“Ticlo, a BJP MLA himself, has accused Sawant of not allowing him to function, due to which the industrial sector has been suffering immensely,” Khaunte said, adding, “The GIDC chairman’s and Kochkar’s frustration has exposed how the Sawant-led government is a divided house on all fronts.”

Taking a dig at the state for spending Rs 2.5 crore on Vibrant Goa, Khaunte said the funds should have been utilised to upgrade infrastructure at the 23 industrial estates.

Khaunte also accused Sawant of compromising on the welfare of the state.

320,['27/09/2020'],"Rajasthan: Visitors start arriving, but marketing should be priority","Shops closed in the market of Walled City

JAIPUR: A little over a year ago, the tourism industry was buzzing. Not only the number of tourist arrivals had crossed 5 million mark in Rajasthan, but the Walled City in Jaipur got the UNESCO heritage tag . A couple of months later, UNESCO again joined hands with the state tourism department to revive and preserve the intangible heritage of western Rajasthan, home to Langa and Manganiyar artistes.

Cut to now. All seems to have happened a long back. The promise of the strategic moves may lie in some unknown future. The immediate urgency is survival and then revival. At stake is livelihoods of lakhs of people engaged in the sector, who come from various walks of life and economic conditions, from poor camel riders, folk singers to well-paid hospitality professionals.

But there is so much the department can do. Neither the Central government nor the state has announced any tangible relief to the sector. Rather taxes have been increased. Adding to the woes is the state government’s austerity measure that has reduced the department’s normal budget. All that the department can do is to watch the trends and hope situation becomes better with more and more people starting to travel again. And there is a small relief as well. Tourism officials said occupancy in the hotels across Rajasthan has inched up, ranging between 25-30%. On weekends, it crosses 50%.

“We are witnessing a momentum in tourism arrivals during weekends which has started spilling over to weekdays as well. We expect the numbers will further rise as we enter the festive season. Our present focus is on igniting domestic tourism as foreign tourist arrival scenario is yet to become clear,” said Alok Gupta, principal secretary , department of tourism.

The number of visitors to the monuments and museums has also seen an increase after they were opened on June 1. Rajasthan was the first in the country to open its state monuments for the visitors.

Mugdha Sinha, secretary, Art & Culture, Archaeology, said, “Things returning to near normal is a heartening sign and we look forward to balancing the need for safety in Covid times with art and entertainment as something that can heal people and societies in the difficult times we are passing through.”

After Gupta joined the department in July, his first task was to roll out the tourism policy which the state cabinet cleared early this month. But implementing the policy measures requires funding which is not there now. “There is no money. The best they can do is to create strategies right now. As soon as the situation improves a little, they should start implementing the projects on a war-footing. Marketing initiatives need to be taken up with priority so that we don’t lose out,” said the member of an industry association.

321,['27/09/2020'],"Positive bizman uses personal experience, starts NGO to help other Covid-19 patients","Nagpur: Soon after completing home isolation period, a 24-year-old businessman started an NGO based on his experience, to arrange tests, ambulance, oxygen, hospital bed and even food for helpless citizens.

Ashutosh Punyani, a resident of Wardhaman Nagar, had tested positive along with all family members. His 52-year-old father was the first to test positive on August 19, which forced all of them too to take a test.

His father was symptomatic and breathless right from the first day of falling ill. Yet, Ashutosh could find medical oxygen and hospital bed only after prolonged delay. Once his father was admitted on August 23, Ashutosh immediately made his contact number public on his Instagram account, offering guidance and support on phone from home.

After he completed his isolation period, he and 12 other friends formed NGO ‘Help For Good’ and the members increased to 60 within two weeks. “We have helped people find eligible plasma donors, ambulance, ventilator, teleconsultation and above all hospital beds,” he said.

GMCH’s Dr Sameer Kedar, music producer Siddarth Panchmatia, food blogger Shruti Bhoyar, fashion designer Juhi Sethi, interior designer Malvikar Trivedi, lawyer Disha Khandewal, BCom student Palak Surana and Yash Bajaj were among the founding members of the NGO. Shoeb Memon, Dr Arati Jain, Dr Akshanta Sharma, and Dr Kapil Jain too joined the cause later.

Ashutosh said from the day his father became breathless to the time he finally got admitted in a private hospital, he realized the plight of hundreds of fellow citizens battling similar issues. “I offered all help and my number on my Instagram account. Instantly I started getting calls. In some cases, I too would call up those seeking help after finding their SOS messages online,” he said.

In one instance, he also offered to donate plasma while responding to a post, unaware that asymptomatic patients are not eligible donors.

“We have built a network now and work as a bridge between affected citizen and resources,” he said.

The NGO has also been simultaneously working on identifying prospective plasma donors to help local authorities ramp up collection and help critical patients. “Each member is asked to identify at least five recovered Covid patients and talk to them. We counsel them about the therapy and resources they carry to help save lives,” said Ashutosh.

The NGO doesn’t promote any blood bank or hospital but leaves it to the discretion of people. “We just furnish all information.Ultimately, it depends on the donors. Likewise, our volunteers suggest hospitals and liase with them for patients,” he said.

Police opened fire and shot rubber bullets to disperse the uncontrollable youths who created ruckus. Two people were killed reportedly in the violence, however, authorities were not available for confirmation.

Three senior police officers Dinesh MN , M L Lathar and Anand Srivastava rushed to Dungarpur to control the situation.

Tension continued unabated in Dungarpur and Udaipur districts on the third day as hundreds of tribal youths remained unmoved on the appeals of the authorities and political leaders and continued to camp in jungles and hills at Kankri Doongri in Bicchiwads of Dungarpur district on Saturday.

Additional forces were deployed on the 10 kilometre-long stretch between Bicchiwada and Kherwada and police patrol teams continuously made vigilant rounds to check any untoward incident.

Police sources said cases have been lodged against more than 500 people for the violence causing harm to lives and public property. Meanwhile, the protesters refused to move from the area or withdraw the agitation until all of their demands were met.

MUMBAI: Unlike Indonesia , Ethiopia and Pakistan, India has stood out as the only country in recent years to not release a preliminary report within a month of a major airline accident .

Fifty days ago, 19 people were killed when an Air India Express aircraft overshot the table-top runway of Calicut airport and crashed. To learn what went wrong, pilots, passengers and other stakeholders will need to wait till January when a final report of the crash is likely to be released by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.

A total of 193 countries, including India, follow aircraft accident investigation norms laid down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Under these norms, within a month of an accident, a preliminary report on the incident is required to be sent to ICAO. The final report comes within a year.

The civil aviation ministry did not respond to TOI’s specific query on whether a preliminary report on the Calicut crash has been sent to ICAO. In a responce to TOI query on the Calicut incident, ICAO said that it doesn’t maintain record of preliminary reports.

Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert said, “Withholding important safety data or overlooking known safety issues is detrimental since they have the capacity to prevent future accidents.”

DEHRADUN: After several complaints from parents regarding their child being blocked from accessing school ’s online classes for not paying fees, the state education minister Arvind Pandey has asked all district education officers to look into these cases with immediate effect.

There have been several incidents of parents complaining of schools forcing them to pay the tuition fees with immediate effect while some schools have been accused of giving poor quality education in the name of online classes.

“I have received several complaints that private schools are violating the government ’s order. Strict action will be taken against the private schools if found guilty,” said Pandey.

Notably, the state government’s order issued in July states that schools are allowed to just charge the tuition fees only if they are conducting online classes. This has led to many schools doing simple Whatsapp forward in the name of online classes so that they can be eligible to charge the tuition fees. Also, many schools have been accused of including other charges, which aren’t allowed currently, in the tuition fees which has made it exorbitantly high.

JAIPUR: This year, the World Tourism Day will be celebrated on Sunday under the shadow of the pandemic . Instead of celebrations, the industry is pleading with the government to extend relief so that it can survive.

Apurv Kumar, former chairman of CII-Rajasthan, said, “It is for the first time we are asking for some reasonable assistance in terms of waving fixed charges of electricity bills and exemption of bar licence fee for this financial year.”

Even though tourism industry has been declared as industry long back, it pays the electricity charges at commercial rates, which is much higher. Similarly, the water charges are higher for industry, and here tourism units are classified as industry.

Surendra Singh Shahpura, promoter of a group of hotels , said, “It’s high time such step-motherly treatment to tourism is stopped. No time better than now when the industry is struggling to survive.”

He said that for one year, all the renewal of licences of the hotel industry should be deemed approved and the competition deadline of all ongoing tourism units should be extended by at least two years.

“Date of completion for real estate and other infrastructure projects has been extended, but the same has not been done for hospitality units. Cash flows of hotels have dried up and they have to pay salary to staff and service their debt. Keeping the difficult situation in mind, the completion dates should be extended by two years,” added Shahpura. In a letter to the tourism minister, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Rajasthan (HRAR) said that many hotels cannot pay back the loans they have taken due to the disappearance of business and they need relief.

Kuldeep Singh Chandela, president of HRAR, said, “We urge the state government to convince the Centre for announcing moratorium on loans taken by hospitality units for at least two years.”

Chandela said that unless the sector revives, the rising unemployment will continue and lakhs people will be deprived of livelihoods opportunities.

329,['27/09/2020'],Virtual admission to Delhi University: Be alert about eligibility,"Delhi University is likely to announce its first cutoff list on October 12

NEW DELHI: With the admission process at Delhi University (DU) going online this year in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the process of changing colleges upon declaration of consecutive cutoffs may be a risky affair for students. College principals advise students to be very careful while checking their eligibility.

DU is likely to announce its first cutoff list on October 12.

“Suppose during the admissions, a college finds that a student is unfit for the course. Earlier, we used to send such students to other colleges but now the process won’t be so easy. There is not much provision of rectification,” said Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College.

Sanjeev Singh, director of the university’s computer centre, said: “Changing the course and college after the cutoff’s declaration will be allowed, but the risk will be high. The process is dynamic and there is a large number of applications for all courses and colleges. It may happen that the situation changes by the time the student cancels and takes admission to any other college. Colleges, too, need to be very careful while approving and cancelling any admission.”

Singh added: “The admission process is the same like last year but everything will be done online. The colleges will calculate the cutoff and the systems will provide them assistance. The details of students and their documents will be available with the college. Once the colleges approve the admission, students will be able to pay the fees.”

Unlike previous years, there will be no physical verification of original documents during admissions this year.

“That is why the admission will be on a provisional basis. There is also a ruling of the Supreme Court, which states admission is provisional subject to the verification of documents till December 31,” said Singh.

SP Agarwal, principal of Ramanujan College, said that verification of uploaded documents would not be a problem. “Most of the results these days are available digitally,” added Agarwal.

He stated that the new system would not be very difficult provided the university portal works well. “The college IT system will also have to be equipped,” he added.

Sinha, too, said that online admissions would be convenient for both parents and students.

“Those colleges that have completed the admission process and who have no general category seat vacant are eligible to request for conversion of the reserved seats,” a state official said.

The state had earlier instructed the institutes to keep no seat vacant and extended the last date for admissions to October 30. Hence, those colleges with vacancies in reserved seats will apply for the de-reservation.

“Since the de-reservation can be done after filling-up of all the general seats and with no possibility of any reserved candidate applying, we shall approach the authorities when our admissions are over. However, some colleges in the districts have reported that their seats have been filled up. They may seek de-reservation,” said a CU-affiliated college principal.

After feeding the digital image, the app will process the image using face recognition technology and match it with the database consisting of 3,000 criminals in Madurai since 2016.

Police would usually take the suspects to the station for verification and use the database available in Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS). It is a time-consuming process and innocents would have to undergo unnecessary distress. The new application named FACETAGR can solve the issue.

Deputy commissioner of police, law and order, Madurai city R Shiva Prasad said, “The app is in use for the past 10 days and it has been working seamlessly. Already many suspects have been identified through the application and appropriate actions have been initiated against them.”

Police officials said the database will be updated time to time with the details of criminals not only from Madurai but also from other neighbouring districts. The city police have been fully utilizing the technological advancement in crime prevention and detection.

Recently, an app was introduced by the city police commissioner, Prem Anand Sinha, to effectively track rowdy elements by compiling details of 700 rowdies and their leaders. Police are also concentrating on installing automatic number plate recognition camera at important junctions and roads.

344,['27/09/2020'],"Kolkata: Pandemic forces pandals to tweak plans, week-long showers add to problems","KOLKATA: Regular showers in the past week have hit Durga Puja preparations across the city with several organisers shifting the work indoors and others planning to extend working hours after the rainy phase is over.

Parks that had been shut in several parts of Kolkata, Salt Lake and New Town due to Covid-19 restrictions, were made available to the Puja committees last week for setting up of pandals and other activities.

The rain made the grounds and parks muddy, making it difficult for the workers to set up the pandals. The fact that this time the pandals won’t be as elaborate as the previous years, brought some relief to organizers. But they also want to finish the work before Tritiya when people start visiting the pandals.

The preparations this year started late as organizers were not sure of the safety guidelines the government had been preparing.

Raja Banik of AK Block in Salt Lake said they had shifted the work to their community hall for the time being as AK Park, where the puja is held every year, was muddy and workers were finding it difficult to set up the pandal. “As soon as the weather gets better, we shall put the components together at the park. We shall not miss the deadline,” said Banik, executive member of the AK Block Puja committee, which started in 1988 and is one of the biggest crowd-pullers in Salt Lake.

There was some uncertainty around the biggest festival of the state due to the pandemic and economic distress. The state government then stepped in and granted an allowance of Rs 50,000 for every Durga Puja. It has also handed over a list of safety guidelines which all Puja committees will have to follow.

Many committees are contemplating increasing the work hours after the weather improves. “It has been raining every day for the past eight days. Many organizers may have to increase working hours. Some may have to work even after sunset so that the pandals are completed on time. The work started late this year anyway. The organizers will also have to ensure that all the Covid safety guidelines are adhered to,” said Tushar Saha, assistant secretary of Forum for Durgotsab and secretary of the Ultadanga Sangrami Durga Puja .

At the iconic Kumartuli Park Puja venue, work is being done throughout the day and even at night. “The schedule went haywire due to the rains. It was very tight to begin with because all the permissions came in late. We are setting up some of the infrastructure outside the park, which will be put together once the weather improves,” said Ajoy Ghosh, president of Kumartuli Park Sarbojanin Durgotsab .

Following the attack, the state’s chief wildlife warden issued orders to trap or kill the ‘man-eater’ leopard prowling near Pithoragarh town. Earlier, the leopard had killed two persons in the district. On 22 September, the leopard killed a 30-year-old man in Badoli village, and on 24 September, it killed an 11-year-old girl when she was returning from an agriculture field along with other women. These attacks, which have taken place within a span of five days, have led to panic in the district.

Naveen Pant, SDO (Forest) Pithoragarh, confirmed that orders have been issued to trap or kill the leopard and added that the forest department has installed cameras at six spots to track the movements of the leopard. Also, cages have been installed at Badauni and Chhana villages and two teams of forest staff are patrolling the area, he added.

“The department’s first priority is to catch or tranquilise the animal. If no other option works out only then the animal will be killed,” Pant told TOI. The official further informed that hunter Sayad Ali Bin has been deputed for the purpose and he will come soon at Pithoragarh.

In Covid times (which have dragged on), the nutraceutical and supplement advice has also piled on and we are now seeing a surfeit of hypervitaminosis and elemental overload, taken in good faith.Physiology says that the human body needs finite quantities of essential elements for normal metabolism . During times of metabolic stress, heightened doses of the same are desirable to combat this, since they may have a role to play.When Covid appeared on the horizon it was brand new, almost unprecedented in its pathophysiology and uniquely unpredictable in its presenting and attacking features. It was natural, then, for one and all to scrape the bottom and pull the rabbits out of the hat and bring out concoctions of nutraceutical ingredients to fight this invisible and virgin enemy. Zinc and Vitamin C were the most pronounced to be tweeted and preached from the books and social media.The moment some endorsement appeared, capsules even remotely containing these magic potions flew off the shelf and hungry, apprehensive gullibles began gulping them down like manna from heaven.Without taking away from the credits of zinc and Vitamin C in helping to stave off potential infection, note that the role is finite.In the same vein, other immunostimulants also came on to centre court and began seeing brisk sales. Not to be left out, the traditional Indian 'kadha' with haldi and ginger and a host of delightful culinary ingredients was also being lapped up hot.Even admitted patients were bringing with them this holy mixture and coming in with prescriptions, where they had self-doubled the doses of all the immuno-protectors despite having taken them religiously over the past five months.We even had patients who, because a partner had tested positive, had enthusiastically begun drinking extremely hot water - some had even scalded their throats - and had started experiencing severe hyperacidity.Doctors started reporting hypervitaminosis, wherein patients were swallowing 60,000 units of Vitamin D3 daily, which were supposed to be taken monthly, after a few weeks and presenting with this overdosed picture. In fact, manufacturers have posted on their websites how NOT to overdose (Up Rise and D Rise India). Articles regarding turmeric and 'methi' toxicity have already started surfacing with subtle signs of overdose. Irritant dermatitis from overuse of alcohol sanitisers is common.It is mandatory to have medical supervision with adequate punctuation to deliver optimal, and maybe a little more, but not to drown in the possible side effects.Covid continues to deceive the clinicians, fox the epidemiologists and has taken everyone in all countries by surprise, with a novel presentation just when we seem to have caught up with it.The maze of apprehension and fear continues to cloud the community. Common sense, healthy eating, adequate sleep and IMPORTANTLY, masking and distancing cannot be undermined. We still do not have a vaccine and, thus, a rounded approach with rational thinking should be the answer. Herd immunity is desirable but herd mentality is to be shunned.

348,['27/09/2020'],Over 5K flights landed in Calicut after friction test,"MUMBAI: Three weeks before the Air India Express aircraft crashed on landing in Calicut airport , the civil aviation regulator had carried out an audit of the airport, which found that its runway surface was not friction-tested in over seven months when it should have been tested once every quarter.

The said information was shared by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) in response to an RTI query sent by an activist, post the crash. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) audit also found that the AAI-run Calicut airport did not have rescue equipment like prying tool, oscillating saw, and BA spare mask, implying that it was ill-equipped to handle an emergency.

The audit found the “runway friction test is overdue” as it was last carried out on December 30, 2019. After the audit on July 15, AAI sent an “Action Taken report” to DGCA on August 6, stating that the friction tester equipment will reach Calicut Airport on August 7. That was the very day the ill-fated Air India Express Boeing 737 aircraft sped off the table-top Calicut airport runway.

It dropped into a gorge, the fuselage broke into three, killing 19 people. The breaking action afforded by the runway surface on that rainy evening, is one of the factors the investigators will look into.

Why is periodic runway friction testing important?

Air safety expert Captain Amit Singh said: “A medium to big aircraft typically lands at a speed of 220-260 kmph. The primary means of stopping the aircraft is with the wheel brakes. With each touchdown, an aircraft leaves about 700gm of rubber from the tires. If the rubber deposits are not removed periodically, the runway surface get filled with rubber and becomes smooth.”

After the December friction test, over 5,100 flights landed in Calicut between January and July end, according to AAI data.

Moreover, the DGCA July 15 audit was carried out remotely, probably due to the pandemic and so findings that could come only following a physical inspection, like probable rubber deposits on the runway, are absent.

349,['27/09/2020'],Haryana plans at least one woman teacher in its co-ed schools,"The government plans to tweak its teacher transfer policy

GURUGRAM: The state government has decided to tweak its existing teacher transfer policy after a report by the Haryana State Commission for Protection of Child Rights highlighted that many government schools in the state lack women teachers. It aims to depute women teachers to over 30% government schools in the state which don’t have any at present.

As many as 4,283 schools with over 1.5 lakh girl students, out of over 14,000 schools in the state, don’t have women teachers. In Gurugram, at least 123 schools don’t have women teachers, while in Mewat the number is even higher — 510.

This gender imbalance in the deputation of the teachers in the government schools has often been highlighted by academicians, human rights bodies and opposition parties. It is only now, after the commission’s report published earlier this month raised the consequences of this disparity like high dropout rates of girl students, that the government has decided to change the transfer policy.

According to sources in the school education department , the government has directed them to formulate amendments in its transfer policy and make it mandatory for each co-education school in the state to have at least one woman teacher. The matter is under discussion and the government is expected to take a final call soon.

“The issue was taken up with the chief minister, who directed the department to initiate consultations and discussions to bring necessary changes in the transfer policy. The government wants to come up with a mechanism so that every school has a woman teacher. This will not only improve the gender ratio among the teaching staff in government schools, but will also be instrumental in giving a major boost to the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme,” said a senior school education department official.

Earlier this month, the state child rights commission took cognizance of the lack of adequate women teachers after it received a complaint from a girl student in Adampur accusing a male teacher of sexual harassment. An inquiry into the matter revealed that the girl had been facing harassment for long and wasn’t able to narrate her ordeal to anyone as the school had no women teachers. Thereafter, the commission analysed the gender ratio of teachers deployed in government schools across the state.

The commission then issued a letter to the state government, demanding immediate attention on the issue. It stated that as several cases of sexual harassment and violence against are regularly reported from the schools, teachers have the primary task of teaching girl students about ‘good and bad touch’ and how and where to raise their voices.

“In such a scenario, it is essential for the government to ensure that all the schools have required women teachers,” an official from the commission said.

The man and woman are residents of Makarpura. They are in love since their schools days, but their family members are against their marriage. This led them to ink a live-in relationship agreement last year. They have even got married according to Hindu rituals.

But they were separated earlier this month as soon as they applied for marriage registration under the Special Marriage Act. The woman was taken away by her brother and her friends on September 14 and she was forced to withdraw the marriage registration application. The man approached the high court to free the woman from her family members, said his advocate Nisarg Jain.

On Friday night, Vadodara police produced the woman before the high court through video conference from Vadodara’s court campus. On court’s inquiry, the woman said that she was regretting her decision to withdraw application for marriage registration, but that she was firm in her decision to marry her boyfriend.

The court took into consideration “the ground realities” which prevent them to get the marriage registered, and the judges ordered police to provide protection to the couple. The woman chose to stay in a protection home till the marriage is solemnized. The HC ordered the authorities to arrange for the procedure for their marriage. The Vadodara’s principal district judge was directed to provide legal aid to the couple.

As the condition is not so conducive for the couple, the HC ordered that the couple’s marriage application should be sent through video conference only on Monday, and it directed the registrar office to exempt their presence, which is an essential part of the proceeding. “Let no insistence be made by the Registrar for their physical presence in the present situation as both of them have shown their willingness before this court,” the court said.

The HC ordered the district legal service authority to guide and help the couple in procedure and ordered further, “Hand-holding also shall be provided all throughout till the procedure gets culminated into the couple getting married at the end of 30 days.”

HYDERABAD: A tigress from Maharashtra’s Tipeshwar tiger reserve has crossed over into the farthest corner of Telangana’s Adilabad district for the third time in search of a territory.

The two-and-a-half-year-old tigress named ‘i’ because of a mark beside it’s left eye, is currently moving in the 30 km area connecting Hathighat, Pippalkuti, Tamsi (K) and Arli villages in Bheempur Mandal of Adilabad.

While the tigress has been moving in the region for the last two months, sources informed that no direct or indirect sighting was reported in the last couple of days. The tigress was also sighted moving in the area in February and August this year.

“This is the fourth or fifth tiger migrating into Telangana from Tippeshwar. Considering the increasing tiger population in Tippeshwar and number of villages along the tiger corridor between both the states, the tigers migrating from here, including this tigress which crossed over the state border and has entered Adilabad thrice so far, will definitely find a suitable habitat in Kawal tiger reserve, if it proceeds in that direction,” said Ajinder Singh, a wildlife photographer and conservationist.

Authorities from the forest department who are regularly monitoring the movement of the tigress in Bheempur Mandal informed that the big cat is currently living in an agricultural field which is a non-forest area right beside a village.

“Tigers have started migrating into Telangana from Tippeshwar only from last two-three years,” said V Chandrashekar Rao, forest divisional officer, Adilabad.

354,['27/09/2020'],"Min, VCs meet today to plan campus route","Kolkata: The meeting called by education minister Partha Chatterjee on Sunday with all the state university vice-chancellors is likely to lay the road ahead for higher education institutions over the next year.

The meeting, which is scheduled at 1pm, will see a host of discussions over the academic calendar that has been proposed by the University Grants Commission (UGC). This apart, some other topics of discussion will be the remaining seats in colleges across Bengal and the beginning of classes for the intermediate semesters.

Higher education department officials have already sought the list of vacancies from vice-chancellors, who have requested the affiliating college principals to send the data. “There has been a continuous debate that this year, because of the influx of marks in West Bengal Higher Secondary Education, students from other boards like CISCE and CBSE have been deprived of securing the best seats in the most popular colleges of Kolkata,” said an official at the education secretariat in Bikash Bhavan. He added: “Also, the lesser migration of students outside Bengal has worsened the matter. These issues require an elaborate analysis. Since the government has extended the last date for admissions up to October 30, a stocktaking is necessary about where the seats are vacant, in which subjects and in which colleges.”

The UGC calendar to be discussed in details because assembly elections will be held in 2021. “If the calendar has to be followed, then colleges will have to hold six-day classes. Also, there is no provision for any vacations. The minister requires to know the challenges the varsities are likely to face if the proposed calendar is adopted,” pointed out a vice-chancellor.

Also, discussions will be held on the problems being faced due to the online mode of teaching. Since the colleges have been asked to start classes for the first-year students from November 1, the state will fix their own SOPs apart from those that have been sent by the UGC. “There is a massive overhaul in the UG system as per the National Education Policy (NEP). The UG programme will be held over four years. The proposed calendar of UGC this year has gone into micro-detailing that till now was left to the universities, which enjoyed certain autonomy,” pointed out another VC. She added that it is also another issue that will be discussed if at all NEP proposals will be implemented in Bengal.

This is the first time an online format for exams is being followed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Both universities were conducting the exams by sending question papers to students online and then submission of answer scripts written on paper, either online or offline within the allotted time.

At MSU, out of the 1,47,601 registered candidates who were to take part in the exams held so far, 98% had completed the exams and only around 2,000 were absent. The university had recorded 94% submission of answer scripts by online upload while 4% submission was through android application.

“We had better attendance than expected. Since we already had an automated system in place, students faced hardly any difficulties. Since the students only required internet connectivity to download the question paper, even those from rural areas did not face any difficulty,” said K Senthamarai Kannan, MSU Registrar (in charge). Collection centres had also been set up for direct submission of the answer scripts in person to co-ordinators who can then upload them online.

MKU university authorities meanwhile said that they are trying to ensure all students complete their exams without any difficulty or delays in a smooth manner.

“There were a few issues during the first three days as this is the first time for students and faculty. However, it was sorted and since students were also allowed to make direct submissions to their respective exam centres, there were no complaints. Parents have also been highly supportive and co-operative. As of now, we recorded 94% attendance,” said M Krishnan, vice-chancellor, MKU.

The last exam for final semester students of both universities is on September 30. Though concerns were raised by educationalists and college principals about the possibility of malpractices like copying answers, looking up answers on internet, and impersonation, the universities have assured that measures for scrutinizing the answer scripts are in place to prevent such practices.

358,['27/09/2020'],Kolkata: Three big single screens to walk the cineplex way,"KOLKATA: Pandemic-induced shutdown of cinemas has forced the owner of Minar, Bijoli and Chhabighar to rethink. He has resurrected plans of converting his theatres to double screens that were aborted due to demonetization. The owner now wants to retain the movie experience at his chain of theatres but do away with the single-screen format. He is hoping that the state government allows single window clearance to turn them into cineplexes.In 1930, Hari Priya Paul had built the Chhabighar cinema hall . Five years later, he inaugurated Bijoli. Minar was inaugurated after another seven years, on May 2 in 1942 with the film titled ‘Nan’.It was in Bijoli that Satyajit Ray had organised special shows of ‘Pikoo’ and ‘Sadgati’. ‘Goopi Gyne Bagha Byne’ had run for 60 weeks at Bijoli. Ritwik Ghatak’s ‘Jukti Tokko Aar Goppo’ was also released there. Rituparno Ghosh’s ‘Unishe April’ initially had no takers and was released in this chain with a premiere at Bijoli.Paul’s grandson Suranjan, the current owner of the chain, is keen on running the show. “My son, Siddhanth, is a student of cinematography and my daughter, Attisa, is studying management. Like me, they too want to join this profession of movies. All of us want Minar-Bijoli-Chhabighar to continue the tradition of screening movies while reinventing the original format. Keeping in mind the changed viewing patterns, double screens are the best option,” he said.In July 2016, there were plans to convert these three theatres into double-screen properties with shopping malls. The halls were shut to kickstart the process. “However, demonetization upset everything and we opened the theatres as single screens. In between, our theatres did get attention. The Oscar awards jury meetings for Indian entry were held at Bijoli. Screenings of Kolkata film festival movies were done at Bijoli and Minar. We introduced 3D viewing in these two theatres for screening ‘Avengers’.”The pandemic, he said, has helped firm up his mind. “During the pandemic, we decided on going the double-screen way. The façade will remain the same. Since the structures are old, the revamp work has to be done slowly and with care,” he said. After converting to double screens, he intends to pull back the crowds. “We pray that the government gives us tax holidays for recovery of investments. A single-window clearance for all formalities and speedy sanction of permissions will help us immensely to save our theatres.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78343291,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-157278,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/three-big-single-screens-to-walk-the-cineplex-way/articleshow/78340026.cms

NEW DELHI: A man has been arrested for allegedly stealing from houses in upscale residential colonies of northwest Delhi. Police said that the man would recce the colonies for locked houses during the day on his sports bicycle and targeted the area at night. Gold jewellery and Rs 4.7 lakh in cash has been seized from the man.

The burglar has been identified as Shravan Mehtav, a resident of jhuggi cluster in Pitampura. Mehtav came under the scanner after a house owner in Pitampura reported a burglary on Wednesday.

Police checked CCTV footage from near the house and zeroed in on a suspect riding a sports bicycle wearing a red Tshirt and blue trousers. “At least 75 clips from different areas were screened to track the man and he was finally identified as a resident of a jhuggi cluster in Pitampura. He was arrested on Friday,” said a police officer.

During questioning, Mehtav initially denied his role. However, when he was confronted with the footage, he confessed to have burgled the house. On Mehtav’s instance, police recovered cash Rs 4.7 lakh from his jhuggi along with stolen jewellery. A chisel and a hammer used to break into the houses were also seized along with his bicycle.

Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said Mehtav used the bicycle to avoid suspicion while checking out houses. “With his arrest, we have solved eight cases of burglaries in and around Maurya Enclave and Pitampura. We are also checking whether he had any associates,” Arya said.

360,['27/09/2020'],"CCP to outsource waste collection to reduce cost, improve efficiency","Panaji: The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) intends to outsource door-to-door garbage collection and transportation services to a private agency. The move, said CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues, is aimed at improving the efficiency of waste management and making the process cost effective.

CCP has categorised the work in two packages – wet waste and dry waste – and plans to outsource the entire process for a period of five years.

“There has been a paradigm shift in recent years in the way the municipal solid waste should be managed,” stated Rodrigues in the tender document.

The corporation has been toying with the idea of outsourcing garbage collection since 2014. The tender for wet and dry waste collection, which was issued last fortnight, does not include door-to-door wet waste.

CCP hopes that by outsourcing the contract , the capital city’s waste management services will become regular and function as per the schedule timings with proper frequency and route management.

The civic body will provide six trucks for dry waste collection and five waste compactors for wet waste while the agency will have to provide the workers. CCP plans to procure new garbage compactors which would be provided to the selected agency.

“The dry waste from residential colonies, hotels and restaurants, commercial establishments, sorting stations, Panaji Municipal market, from litter bins and domestic biomedical waste from residential colonies is to be transported to the material recovery facility at St Inez in the vehicles handed over to the service provider. The wet waste from the litter bins is to be transported to the wet waste processing facility behind Heera petrol pump site located near KTC bus stand, Panaji,” an official said.

To ensure that the agency abides by the contract, CCP has sought a Rs15 lakh security deposit. The CCP may increase or decrease the number of residential colonies and commercial establishments from where waste would be required to be picked up.

KOLKATA: The Kolkata traffic police has provided a list of over 200 spots to KMC and other civic bodies with photographic evidence to highlight the need for urgent road repairs. The list has been compiled at Lalbazar after taking data from 25 traffic guards. An assessment of the road condition is carried out before Durga Puja each year but it has been delayed this year due to the Covid situation. Last week, KMC board of administrators chairman Firhad Hakim had carried out a review meeting.

Among the major roads identified for repair are EM Bypass, Diamond Harbour road, SP Mukherjee Road, Deshapran Sasmal Road, Central Avenue, Strand Bank Road and MG Road. The key stretches include Hyatt crossing and Beliaghata Main Road crossing on the Bypass, Ramlochan Mullick Road Road crossing on MG Road, Madan Chatterjee crossing on CR Avenue, the Phalpatti Crossing on CR Avenue and the Behala Chowrasta Crossing on DH Road.

DC (traffic) Rupesh Kumar said the list includes stretches that need both major repairs and those which need a patchwork. Among other important roads in the list are the BK Pal Avenue, Nimtala Ghat Street and Taratala Road as well as roads maintained by Kolkata Port Trust, Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority and state Public Works Department.

Hakim has said the repair of all bad stretches will be complete by October 15. KMC will not allow any roads to be dug after October 1.

A bench, which heard four PILs so far on the same subject, directed the registry to tag the current plea with them and issued notices to the state and central authorities and sought their replies within two weeks on the contentions raised by the petitioner.

The plea was filed by Mohammed Mushtaq Mallik of Chaderghat, who wanted the Centre, minority welfare ministry, the central waqf council along with the Telangana State Waqf Board, police and revenue authorities to take action against the state council of ministers for ordering unilateral demolition without resorting to the laws related to waqf and endowments properties. The petitioner, who is president of Tahreek Muslim Shabban, an organisation working for the welfare of miniorities, said the cabinet headed by CM K Chandrasekhar Rao did not keep people informed of its decision to demolish the places of worship inside the secretariat complex.

Initially, the government said the places of worship were crushed under the weight of the debris of a nearby building, but later admitted that they had demolished it, the petitioner said.

He also narrated about the government’s assurance to rebuild the mosques with modern amenities and urged the court to summon the map of the new secretariat to ascertain the same.

The case will come up for hearing after two weeks.

Extension of the offer has received a mixed response from owners of commercial establishments and self-employed.

While some appreciated the move pointing out towards Covid-19, some said discount should be given based on financial condition of the property owner and rental value. As on date, 78,137 property owners have paid the dues under the scheme and Rs 174.27 crore has been collected.

“When the scheme was rolled out, businesses in the city had just started picking up after the lockdown. It is difficult to clear arrears. Extending the scheme couldn’t have come at a better time,” said Faraan Rokadia, managing director of Luxury Ridez, Jubilee Hills.

Akhil Agarwal, a city-based businessman who supplies construction material, said: “Discount should be given only to the poor and an income slab should be fixed. If everyone gets a discount, people who pay taxes on time will also be discouraged.”

Under the scheme, those who have to pay property tax dues with interest need to pay 10% of their accumulated interest along with principal amount up to 2019-20.

According to GHMC officials, the scheme has been receiving a good response. “Property owners initially were apprehensive. But, are optimistic now and are coming forward to clear the arrears,” said a GHMC official.

PANAJI: A day after he lashed out at the Goa State Industries Association (GSIA) for alleging corruption , CM Pramod Sawant on Saturday said that his “focus would be to bring it down to zero level”.

Speaking to reporters after the BJP state executive committee meeting,he said that he has tried to stop corruption from day-1, and wherever possible, he has stopped it.

Sawant said he would hold a meeting with the Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) to review the ease of doing business in the state.

On Friday, Sawant lashed out at the GSIA for saying that he failed to keep his promise to improve ease of doing business.

The GSIA had said that the government was making “life more miserable” for entrepreneurs.

“People have the habit of criticising everything when they do not get benefits, and that is the trend,” Sawant had said.

After Goa’s rankings in the ease of doing business rankings slipped to 24 from 21, Sawant had promised to improve the state’s business environment.

The association also led a scathing attack on the functioning of GIDC, and said “corruption has scaled new heights” in the corporation.

“Under-the-table rates are being fixed for every routine service,” association president Damodar Kochkar had said. “They (GIDC) have even fixed their commission for allotment of new plots in various industrial estates.”

“What happened to the chief minister’s promise about a meeting to improve ease of doing business in Goa? Like all other political assurances, this too seems to have been forgotten. It looks like the industry is also at the bottom of his priority list.”

“We support and promote education in the mother tongue, and we are of the opinion that primary education should be in the mother tongue,” he said.

Sawant said that the state government requested banks to extend the moratorium on loans by another three months.

The BJP’s state executive meeting, conducted mostly virtually, congratulated the Centre for the completion of a successful, eventful, and challenging first year.

He said that even though the state has slipped in the ease of doing business rankings, the government has taken up with the Centre its plan to bring industries to the state.

Sawant said that revenue collection of the state government is around 35-40% (of normal). “When I became CM, the total state loan was around Rs 20,240 crore,” he said. “I have taken a loan of Rs 2,500 crore, but repaid Rs 3,500 crore.” Sawant also said that a study has been conducted to put the state’s finances in place by March 2021.

He also said that the new education policy was discussed at the executive committee. He also said that BJP would start training its karyakartas with the 2022 assembly election in mind.

369,['27/09/2020'],"‘Nagin’ revenge rumour busted, gram pradhan, aides arrested for murder","LUCKNOW: A farm caretaker ’s murder in Barabanki was hushed up as a snake-bite death by the propaganda machinery of the village head, who termed it as ‘revenge of the naagin (female cobra)’. But cops got breakthrough two weeks back when they acted on a tip-off and extricated the body from the burning pyre and sent it for autopsy, which revealed it was death by strangulation, not snake poison as peddled by the village head, Vijendra Shukla . He along with brother and two accomplices were arrested on Saturday for murder of the caretaker, Ramu Trivedi. They were all residents of Behleempur Majra village under Haidergarh police station.

The gram pradhan wielded considerable influence in the village and spread a rumour that Trivedi died of snake bite. He took a cue from 2019 incident in which a snake had died in a thresher and churned out the theory that its mate had extracted its revenge by snuffing out Ramu, said police.

Superintendent of police, Barabanki, Arvind Chaturvedi, who supervised the probe said, Vijendra lived in Lucknow, but his location was found near the crime spot at odd hours on September 11, 12 and 13.

“We also enquired in the village about Ramu and got to know that he had begun talking abut his romance with Vijendra’s wife,” said Chaturvedi. It was also learnt that Ramu worked as a care-taker in the fields and would often come and stay in the pradhan’s home after getting friendly with Vijendra’s wife.

“This angered the pradhan and he tried to deter Ramu from visiting his wife, but to no avail. Finally, he decided to eliminate him. And he along with his brother, driver and domestic help met on September 11 and 12 to plan the murder. The next day, Ramu was strangled to death,” said the SP.

371,['27/09/2020'],Govt doctor invests retirement benefits on farm to shelter abandoned dogs,"Madurai: A government doctor from Madurai has invested Rs 40 lakh from his retirement benefits on a farm on the outskirts of Madurai to shelter community dogs, where around 200 previously abandoned dogs are already being sheltered.

Dr A Paramasivam, who worked as an anaesthesiologist in government hospitals including the Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai said that he has always been drawn towards the gratitude that dogs express even after being fed only a little. “This is something I find missing in the humans and always tried to do something for these community dogs,” he said.

“I always fed street dogs near my house in Viswanathapuram in Madurai. I set up cages and kept some dogs there but it caused problems with my neighbours, so I bought the farm with my retirement benefits in Lakkampatti near Palamedu and took my dogs there after my retirement three years ago,” he said.

This shelter has sheds and playing space for the dogs, said Dr Paramasivam, who felt that the dogs seemed unhappy when they were confined to their cages. There are four caretakers who make food, using 10 litres of milk, 50 eggs and rice for a meal for these dogs every day and their diets include buttermilk and curd also. Working post retirement in a hospital in Kulasekharam in Tuticorin district, Dr Paramasivam said that this salary helps meet his monthly expenditure for the shelter, which comes to around Rs 50,000. “I do not want to turn it into an NGO funded by others and do not want to make money or draw fame from it,” he said. His wife Dr P Vijayalakshmi, who also retired from government service, recently shares his love for dogs and his two children, both doctors have assured him that they would take care of the shelter in future too.

“My only instruction to the caretakers is that the dogs should always be happy, and I vaccinate and deworm them regularly,” he said.

373,['27/09/2020'],Kerala: Palarivattom flyover demolition works to commence tomorrow,"A view of the usual traffic jam near Palarivattom flyover on Saturday

KOCHI: If everything goes as planned, the demolition works of Palarivattom flyover will begin on Monday. Sources with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) confirmed that they are set to start the work.

The Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society Ltd and DMRC have decided to demolish the flyover in phases. DMRC principal adviser E Sreedharan had assured the government that the flyover will be reconstructed within eight months.

The city police said all measures will be taken to avoid any traffic congestion due to the works.

In the initial stage of demolition, the tarred portion of the flyover will be removed. In this stage there wouldn’t be any need for traffic diversion. But when they begin demolition of the concrete structure there might arise a need to divert traffic.

“We are yet to decide on traffic regulations that have to be put in place during the demolition phase. A meeting will be convened on Sunday to discuss on the traffic movement when works on the flyover begins,” said ACP (traffic east) Francis Shelbi.

Meanwhile, the office of PWD minister G Sudhakaran stated that DMRC could begin work at any time. “In the present scenario there is no hindrance to start the work,” said an official.

The funds which remain with DMRC after execution of various projects undertaken by them in Kochi will be used for the reconstruction of the flyover.

The state government has decided to open Vyttila and Kundanooor flyovers on NH 66 for traffic in December. Meanwhile, it is pointed out that Palarivattom flyover is equally significant in addressing the traffic blocks on NH 66 as well as to ease down traffic flow through Kochi city.

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had pointed out that more than a year was lost as the government fought legal battles for going ahead with the reconstruction of Palarivattom flyover.

The state government decided to proceed with reconstruction of the flyover after a Supreme Court order. The court asserted that the state government is allowed to take immediate action to reconstruct the flyover considering public safety.

Earlier, the high court had issued an order directing to conduct a load test before demolishing the flyover. Later, the government moved the apex court against this order.

The sanctioned number is adequate,” a senior TNSTC official said. Meanwhile, locals have sought a status report on the e-bus project since its been close to a year, the TNSTC had identified potential routes. “Trichy was missed in the JnNURM scheme, so e-buses should be commissioned here at the earliest to improve urban transport infrastructure,” N Manivannan, member, Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavours (TIDES) said.

Stakeholders feel the “old formula” of marketing and promotion will not work since the world is experiencing dramatic changes due to Covid “When we are marketing Goa, it is very important that standard operating procedures (SOPs) and checks and balances have to be in place. Secondly, the theme should be healthy and safe Goa,” hotelier Ralf de Souza said.Every state, he said has their own SOPs in place, but in Goa there is nothing. “Anybody and everybody can walk-in. In that terms it is a dicey situation,” he said.“If we promote Goa as before that will be a joke. The previous campaign that Goa is a 365 days destination does not hold good in the changed circumstances,” de Souza said.The primary step would be working towards having more recoveries and less infections. An healthy Goa will be the biggest USP, feel stakeholders.The state government is yet to take a call on how the destination should be promoted to take the industry forward, secretary tourism J Ashok Kumar said. However, the inclination will be towards using digital platforms for promotion and marketing, he said.“We will need to wait for the industry to open up because right now we are in the grip of the pandemic. Few hotels have reported good occupancy this month and hopefully, the situation will improve. We will see the trend in October and accordingly chalk out a strategy,” Kumar said.He said that the government will not like to spend on promotion and marketing like earlier as the finance department has imposed restrictions. All marketing and promotion activity will have to be carried out in a focused manner,” he said.Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) president Nilesh Shah said that presently things are difficult and the state will have to become more creative and innovative in pushing the industry forward. “There will have to be synergy between various stakeholders of the industry such as travel agents, hotels and tour operators as was seen over a decade ago,” he said.The key to marketing will be sending a right message to potential travellers, Shah said. It is the wrong notion that the cases in Goa are rising because a lot of people are visiting the state since borders have been opened, he said.“I want to know which part of the state has seen a surge in Covid cases only due to the tourists.

AHMEDABAD: After schools agreeing to a 25% cut in tuition fees, colleges have now come forward to offer similar relief for students for the academic year 2020-21 keeping in view the Covid-19 situation.

The spokesperson for the Fee Regulatory Committee (Technical) Jainik Vakil said fees in colleges will be reduced on the same lines as that of schools.

Sources said that the tuition fees of technical colleges in the state are likely to be reduced by 20-25% and it will benefit students across 700 colleges. The decision is likely to be announced in October.

In response to a PIL filed in the Gujarat high court recently, the court had asked that if fees can be reduced for schools, why can’t students of self-financed colleges get the same benefits?

“In response to an oral order passed by the Gujarat high court on September 17 pertaining to a PIL filed in connection to college fees reduction, Fee Regulatory Committee (Technical) has decided to deliberate the issues mentioned in the petition with the representatives of the university,” the official on special duty (OSD) to Fee Regulatory Committee has informed all universities of Gujarat in writing.

The universities have been asked to name two representatives along with their contact details by September 26, according to the letter.

The letter was also addressed to SFI Colleges Association, Ahmedabad, Association of AICTE Approved Self-financed Colleges of Gujarat, Rajkot, and Association of Gujarat Engineering and Technical Diploma Colleges based in Ahmedabad.

Nehal Shukla, president of Association of AICTE Approved Self-Financed Colleges of Gujarat said all college authorities are on the same page for reduction of tuition fees.

“We believe that fees should be reduced in the wake of Covid-19 this year. How much the reduction should be, will be decided only after discussion with the members. Our representatives will hold discussion with the Fee Regulatory Committee for a final decision on the matter.”

The committee will look into the issue of reduction in fees for all technical courses including engineering, pharmacy, architecture, diploma courses, MBA, MCA, among others.

Earlier this week, the authorities of various self-financed schools agreed to the state government’s proposal of reducing tuition fees by 25% for the 2020-21 academic year.

The decision was arrived at during a meeting between education minister Bupendrasinh Chudasama and representatives of various schools on Thursday, said Jatin Bharad, vice-president of Self-Finance Management Association of Gujarat. The move is expected to offer respite to over 30 lakh students in the state across 20,000 schools.

Health officials said 28 people from the village, on being informed they were positive, went into hiding on Friday.

“As all the patients were asymptomatic, they refused to accept that they were infected,” said Peravurani tahsildar Jayalakhshmi. However, health officials pacified them by explaining about asymptomatic cases and took them to a Covid care centre for further treatment.

As part of containing the spread of Covid-19 in the district, the collector has instructed health officials to conduct special medical camps and door-to-door screening in rural pockets. Medical camps were held in Sornakkadu and Kazhanivasal village panchayats in Sethubavachathiram block on September 22. The swab samples of 200 villagers were collected and sent to Government Medical College Hospital in Thanjavur.

The results released on Friday revealed that 28 people from Kazhanivasal, 12 from Sornakkadu and one from Veeraraghavapuram villages tested positive. The patients from Sornakkadu and Veeraraghavapuram volunteered themselves and got admitted at the Covid-19 care center in Pattukottai. However, the villagers from Kazhanivasal refused to turn up at the centre and even demanded another test to confirm if they were positive, refusing to accept that they were infected by the virus.

As they did not come to the care centre, a team comprising health and revenue department officials headed by Peravurani tahsildar Jayalakshmi rushed to the village along with local body representatives. They could not locate anyone as their homes were found locked. Officials managed to locate them from neighbouring houses and villages and brought them back.

After Unlock 4.0, Thanjavur has been witnessing more positive cases, as people are not adhering to social distancing and not wearing masks.

The exams for undergraduate and postgraduate students which began on Monday (September 21) concluded on Saturday. Around 50,000 students appeared for the examinations.

Students were asked to appear for the online examination from home. The question paper was downloaded from a dedicated portal created for the purpose. After writing the answers in A4 sheets, students were asked to upload them back on portal or send it through email. They were also asked to send the hard copy of the answer scripts to colleges either by post or in-person.

The university on Friday asked non-autonomous affiliated colleges to send a list of faculty members to interested in carrying out evaluation of answer scripts received through the university portal and email.

Faculty members must come in person to the university to conduct the evaluation while following standard operating procedure for Covid-19. For the next two days, BDU computer staff will segregate the answer scripts received online.

“The answer scripts stored in the server will be distributed to over 200 computers in the university informatics centre where faculty members will carry out evaluation,” said S Srinivasa Raghavan, BDU controller of examination.

He added that hard copies of answer scripts will be collected from colleges in the next two days and the hard copies of those students who could not upload their answer scripts online will be taken for evaluation. “A section of students either could not upload the answer scripts or they uploaded them in an improper way,” he said.

382,['27/09/2020'],SC likely to hear plea of mining firm tomorrow,"Panaji: The Supreme Court is likely to hear the petition filed by a mining company seeking extension for transportation of royalty paid ore on Monday, advocate general Devidas Pangam said

The court had directed the registry to place the application filed by a mining company seeking extension for transportation of ore before the bench presided over by the Chief Justice of India (CJI).

A three-judge bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud noted that in January, the bench presided by the CJI had granted six months’ time to lift the mineral/iron ore mined before March 15, 2018.

Hence, it requested the registry to place the matters seeking extension before the CJI.

The mining company approached the court stating that the extension was being sought as factors beyond their control had affected ore transportation.

The court had allowed mining leaseholders in the state to transport mined iron ore extracted between February 7 and March 15, 2018, and lying at the pitheads, stockyards or any other storage places.

383,['27/09/2020'],Manage salary of ad hoc teachers: BDU to colleges,"Trichy:Bharathidasan University (BDU) has asked its constituent colleges to manage the salary of ad hoc teachers who draw them through the parents teachers association (PTA) funds.

The university has been supporting colleges in the payment of the salary of a section of PTA teachers. Now it has asked the respective colleges to manage it on their own.

Till last year, there were 10 constituent colleges under BDU out of which four were converted into government colleges. However, the university is managing the cost of running the colleges as the government had promised to reimburse the same at a later stage.

Besides regular teaching and non-teaching staff, the colleges have ad hoc employees, which have outnumbered the number of regular staff in the recent years.

There are three types of ad hoc teaching staff in these colleges, which include guest faculty, teachers on hourly-basis and PTA teachers. The salaries of the guest faculty and teachers on hourly-basis are managed by the university, besides partially managing the payment of the PTA teachers.

Salary of the PTA teachers was managed by collecting Rs 500 from each student per annum. Since the number of teachers increased in numbers, colleges could not manage the salary of these teachers and the university started supporting them for paying their salary. However, vice-chancellor P Manisankar in a letter, dated September 21, to the model and constituent colleges asked constituent colleges to manage the salaries of the PTA teachers on their own.

While Manisankar was unavailable for comments, a senior official from the university said all the government arts colleges are managing PTA staff on their own. Similarly, the constituent colleges too have been asked to do the same. So far, 51 PTA employees were given salary from the university, but it was stopped this month. The respective college principals can place a request to the vice-chancellor to roll back the decision.

384,['27/09/2020'],"18 months after, puzzle parking projects yet to take off in south Delhi","NEW DELHI: To deal with the issue of parking in congested markets, South Delhi Municipal Corporation had laid the foundation of three pilot projects for constructing automatic tower and puzzle parking lots at Green Park, Lajpat Nagar and Adchini in March 2019. They were supposed to create space for 400 cars and the projects were to be completed in just 6-9 months. But even after one and a half years, not even a single parking lot is completely ready.Prior to state elections, the civic agency had inaugurated the partly constructed 17-floor automated tower parking at Green Park in January 2020, but the site couldn’t be used by the public as work was still in progress.TOI visited the Green Park automated parking site on Friday and found labourers still busy with laying tiles, stones and giving finishing looks to the complex. The lifts were, however, installed at the site.Attributing the delay to ban on construction work and Covid crisis, an SDMC official said that the project would take another 12-15 days to be completed. “We have completed more than 95% work. Initially, there was a plan to construct three towers but after land was made available, a fourth tower was also constructed. We will open all the four towers for the general public from the beginning of next month,” added the official.In Lajpat Nagar, the traders and locals are desperately waiting for the puzzle parking lot. “Due to Covid-19, the market saw no footfall. But now, people have started venturing out and we are expecting things to become normal during festivals. It would be great if SDMC makes the project operational next month,” said Ashwini Marwah, general secretary, Traders’ Association of Lajpat Nagar.On Friday, some welding and fabrication work was going on the ground floor while the upper structure looked completed. Lifts were yet to be installed. The market has space for 845 cars and 190 two-wheelers while space required is for minimum 1,200 vehicles at a time, said the traders.Regarding the delay, an SDMC official said that these parking lots were different from convention lots.“We need specialised workers for steel fabrication, welding and modular design. It took contractor time in getting these workers in sufficient numbers post lockdown. Around 75% of work is completed and the public may be able to use the facility in Lajpat Nagar from November beginning,” added the official.Residents are, meanwhile, miffed over the delay. “The parking project was supposed to get completed in 2019 itself. How can officials blame it on Covid-19? Since they are taking too much time, we expect them to install the latest technology so that the parking lots can function without hindrances,” said Pankaj Aggarwal, resident of Sarvodaya Enclave.In Adchini, SDMC claimed to have completed 75% work but a visit to the parking site revealed the work was far from completion and labourers were also not seen. Only concrete base and steel frame were constructed and no fabrication or other work was going on here.These automated parking lots aimed to save time, money and create space in limited area. The retrieval time of a vehicle will be just three minutes compared with 15 minutes in the conventional parking, said an official.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78342410,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-106841,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/18-months-after-puzzle-parking-projects-yet-to-take-off-in-south-delhi/articleshow/78341247.cms

PANAJI: The state government has directed officials to resurvey the land for the new 400 KV electricity line, which will be laid in Mollem as part of the Goa-Tanmar Power Transmission Project, and ascertain the number of arecanut and coconut plantations that can be saved from felling.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant recently held a review meeting regarding the power project.

Power minister Nilesh Cabral said that during the meeting, officials explained the project alignment to the chief minister.

He said that contractors have been granted all permissions to commence work. The land acquisition process has started, Cabral said, and it has been decided to pay two times the government fixed price for executing sale deeds with the land owners.

“The CM has directed officials to submit a detailed report on how many planations can be saved, and a resurvey will be undertaken,” he said.

Cabral said that the officials will also study if the tower height can be increased, which could save plantations. “If the plantation cannot be saved as the power line will pass through it, then we will try to avoid cutting the trees . People want reliable electricity. When there is no power, people blame the government. I understand we have to save trees. We are trying to save it. We will work out a solution,” Cabral said.

Recently, Cabral and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar held a meeting with people at Mollem to explain the advantages of the project and dispel apprehensions. However, that meeting witnessed heated arguments.

In an affidavit submitted in HC, divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar stated that all patients testing positive would be stamped on the backside of their hands, mentioning the isolation period.

If a person undergoes antigen test, s/he would be asked to wait till the result, which usually takes 30 minutes. If they are asymptomatic and found positive, they would be stamped on their hands, the undertaking said.

If the patients have opted for RT-PCR test, whose results are given the next day, their names, mobile number and address is recorded by the officials. “If their results are found to be positive, a Rapid Response Team (RRT)/surveillance team member will visit their address immediately as per protocol and put stamp on their hands mentioning isolation date. All such patients would be telephonically contacted from control rooms maintained by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and district administration,” the affidavit stated.

Justifying the decision, Kumar added that to prevent infected persons from roaming or mixing in public and to treat them properly, as per guidelines, it’s necessary to identify and acknowledge them. “Therefore, it’s must to stamp such Covid positive patients, as per HC directives,” he stated in the affidavit.

The affidavit was filed through additional government pleader Deepak Thakare during hearing of suo motu PIL based on TOI report on shortage beds. Shreerang Bhandarkar is appointed as amicus curiae and assisted by Nidhi Dayani.

Citing Covid-19 infection which is riding a peak, a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Pushpa Ganediwala on Wednesday had come up with a suggestion that all those testing positive should be stamped as ‘Quarantined’ on the wrist, like in case of international travellers. The commissioner had then opposed the suggestion contending that patients would face social stigma.

“The method of inking index finger can be followed for persons who have undergone Covid test and found positive. If tests are conducted on multiple occasions, next finger should be marked with indelible ink. Such marking will enable others to know that person is infected and help in maintaining Covid distancing,” the HC bench had advised.

Quoting lawyers from all parties in the PIL, they added that persons tested positive should be identified, if they are moving around, be it for purchase of essentials or attending duties or in connection with business and profession.

387,['27/09/2020'],Late Chola inscriptions found in Thanjavur,"Thanjavur: Two inscriptions dating back to the period between 10 AD and 15 AD have been found near Budalur in Thanjavur district. The pillar and inscriptions were found in a dilapidated mandapam in front of a Shiva temple.

Belonging to the late Chola period, the inscriptions were found in Eswaran temple at Sanjeevipuram in Veeramarasanpettai by a group of historians headed by Professor S Kannadasan, department of Tamil, Rajah Serfoji Government College, Thanjavur and G Thillaigovindarajan, headmaster of a government primary school at Ponthiyakulam.

They found a fragment inscription belonging to 10-11 AD on the Mukha Mandapam of the temple and another one dating back to the 14th-15th century in the Adhishtana of the mandapam. According to the duo, the fragment inscription mentions the gift of land with clearcut limits as well as of the gift of gold. In another inscription found in the Adhishtana, no mention has been made either of the kings or his period though the day has been inscribed. The individual is mentioned with his family suffix but in a disfigured condition.

It can be inferred from the inscriptions that the end of Pandiya rule must have been the reasons for not mentioning the name of the king. The temple must have been subjected to periodical maintenance by Valappakudiyan, Punganur kilvan, Alvar Nayagan and his brother Valathar. The temple at Sanjeevipuram belongs to Purakiliyur Nadu. During the reign of Rajaraja Chola, Punganur Kamadamangalam (kamathi) also existed without Chola rule. This area must have had people who enjoyed the political backing of the rulers, they added.

KOLKATA: The condition of sisters, Shagufta (20) and Taiba (17) remained critical on Saturday, over 30 hours after they were attacked by a relative at their Ekbalpore home. Though the two girls and their mother, Akida Khatoon (45), tried to fight off Sultan Ansari, he refused to back off, attacking them first with a knife and then, with a grinding stone . Khatoon, wife of Haroon Rashid , a cleric at a central Kolkata mosque, died after being taken to hospital.

“Taiba’s condition is particularly critical,” said a senior police officer. The victims were found with grievous injuries on their faces, necks, chests and hands. Ansari was the step-cousin of Rashid, who lived in Ekbalpore, opposite Bodyguard Lines, with his wife, two daughters and two sons, police said. While Rashid and his sons were away at the time of the attack, Khatoon, Taiba and Shagufta were at home, police added. Rashid has two more daughters who are married.

After the attack, Ansari, a private tutor who lived in Rajabagan area, reportedly walked to the Ekbalpore police station and surrendered himself. He was on Saturday sent to police custody till October 3. “Ansari (25) said his and Rashid’s families have been caught in a dispute for long. He arrived at Rashid’s home around 12.30pm on Friday and tried to talk to Akida and sort out the differences. He wanted to talk about his wish to marry one of the daughters. But Akida asked him to leave. Ansari claimed twice in the past three months, his parents had tried to settle the dispute but were rebuffed, too,” said an officer. DC (Port) Syed Waquar Raza said Ansari did not carry any weapon.

Told to leave, Ansari barged into the kitchen, picked up a knife and attacked Taiba even as Akida tried to stop him, police said. Shagufta rushed to the rescue of her sister and mother, who had fallen to the ground. The two sisters reportedly forced Ansari to drop the knife. But he ran to the kitchen and returned with a grinding stone, with which he attacked all three, police said. As the three collapsed to the ground, Ansari walked to the police station and and told cops to shoot him “for his major crime”.

The drive will continue during the festival season as well.

The aim is to catch the attention of residents towards these cleanliness drives so that they should give better opinion at the time of Swachhta Survekshan rankings. The drive will be carried out regularly every Saturday and Sunday.

For this special sanitation drive the officials have selected 34 roads totalling 76km. The drive was inaugurated from the bus stand and it was carried out at various locations, including Jalandhar bypass to Buddha Nullah, Gill road, Rahon road central verge, Atam Park to Bharat Nagar. Mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal flagged off the teams of MC employees for the drive.

On one road at least 20 employees were deputed. The sweepers were sweeping the roads while horticulture staff was deputed to clear the wild growth from central verges and roadsides. Apart from this, construction and demolition waste as well as heaps of sand collected along roads were also lifted.

Chief sanitary officer and nodal officer of Swachhta Survekshan Ashwani Sahota said they would clean the roads on regular basis every Saturday Sunday, apart from regular cleaning work. He said public opinion matters most in survekshan and when people would see there is change, they would definitely vote in favour of the MC.

The MC commissioner said, “During festival season there will be proper cleanliness in the city and after that it will become a routine thing. But we also require support from public in this drive.” He said the shopkeepers should keep two dustbins and residents should not litter here and there and keep this city clean like they clean their houses.

390,['27/09/2020'],Sukhbir blames Congress MPs and Capt for not stalling farmers’ bills,"LUDHIANA: Having taken a dig at chief minister Amarinder Singh , the Shiromani Akali Dal president and former deputy CM, Sukhbir Badal, while addressing the party workers here on Saturday said, “For almost one and half years Amarinder Singh was fully aware of any such farming bills in the making but he did not disclose it to anybody. If he had talked about it earlier, we could have stopped it there only.”

He also attacked Congress MP Ravneet Bittu and other Congress MPs for walking out of Parliament instead of voting against the bills. Sukhbir was here at Gurdwara Alamgir on Saturday to address the party workers from 14 constituencies of Ludhiana district .

He declared that the Shiromani Akali Dal would whole heartedly support the Punjab chief minister in this initiative. “We urge him to first immediately issue an ordinance declaring Punjab a mandi and follow it up quickly by convening a special session of the Punjab assembly to convert the ordinance into an Act. The Akali Dal urges every political party to rise above political considerations to ensure a unanimous passage of such a bill to declare Punjab a market for farm produce.”

Sukhbir also showed a copy of the election manifesto of Amarinder and claimed that in the manifesto the latter was also talking about bringing the concept of private mandi system in the state. In the Congress manifesto for the parliamentaty elections too it was mentioned that they would bring only private mandi concept by ending the government mandis.

He said instead of fighting with Akali Dal the Congress should fight with the central government for the rights of farmers. Sukhbir also attacked Bittu by saying that at the time of voting the Congress MPs walked out and only he and Harsimrat stood up against this ordinance, where 350 BJP MPs voted in favour of the bills.

Through his address Sukhbir tried to give a message to the farmer community that only the Akali Dal was the party in favour of farmers and in the past whenever a situation had come only Akali leaders had sacrificed their lives and also remained in jails.

He said they were not for power and ministries and Harsimrat’s resignation from the Union ministry was a proof of the same. He said when they came to know about this ordinance they tried to convince their alliance party BJP that farmers would not agree for these bills and for more than two months he had been meeting the farmers’ organisations for discussion over these bills.

He said he also raised the issues of farmer organisations with the BJP government that farmers were saying that MSP and mandi concept would end with these bills but he was given assurance that both things would remain in the bills.

While addressing the party workers, Sukhbir said only one year was left for the elections and all party workers should get ready for a long fight. He said he would have to frame a five-member committee to find out where the chief minister was because during his regime nobody knows where he was.

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Saturday directed IIT-Bombay to file a reply by October 8 to a petition filed by a 23-year-old Navi Mumbai resident, that sought orders for his admission to a postgraduate course at the institute.

The petition, filed by Prathamesh Pedamkar , states that he did not receive an email about his offer letter for the course in Industrial Design, which he had applied for under a category reserved for scheduled castes. The institute said the email was sent on August 2.

A counsel for IIT-B, via video-conference, submitted that the IIT computer cell that ""19 emails"" could not be sent to candidates, including the petitioner, as they were ""blocked"" by a spam folder. Counsel Arsh Mishra said email was not the ""only mode"" via which candidates could check the status of their applications. Successful candidates could find out about their admission on the IIT portal as well, which was accessed by 14 of them who paid fees on time.

The petitioner's counsel, Ashraf Shaikh, said that through no fault of his, the petitioner had failed to receive an email or SMS after the final interview on July 22. Shaikh said before this, the student had received both SMSs and emails throughout the year-long selection process. Shaikh said the student was told that successful candidates would receive an email ""soon"". After the student's queries, Shaikh said on September 1, IIT asked Pedamkar to pay the fees. In a few hours, they emailed him again, asking him to ""ignore"" the congratulatory email.

IIT counsel Mishra said that the petitioner himself had on August 28, checked the portal and seen his status as 'fees not paid'.

Mishra said this indicated that the petitioner was aware that he had to check the portal for updates. The high court asked Mishra whether they could increase the number of seats to accommodate the petitioner. Mishra said it could not be done, as admissions were concluded on August 10. The court adjourned the matter to October 13.

“When did you know of the technical glitch,’’ a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni asked the IIT counsel.

“Petioner has been denied admission because of alleged failure to pay fees on time and allegation of petitioner that he was not informed of such last date has not been specifically denied by IIT Bombay but at the same time the IIT has said that petitioner himself by due diligence could have found out the last date,’’ observed the HC in its order adjourning the matter to October 13 for further hearing.

Shaikh said, as an autonomous institute it could. He pleaded that the petitioner at least be permitted to attend online-classes or receive their videos. The HC orally said it was giving a short date and “no interim relief right now.’

The student’s in his petition said that he wrote to the IIT on August 21 when he received no email and again later on August 28 when he saw his ‘unpaid fees’ status to seek its guidance. In reply, he got emails on August 31 and September 1 appending a ‘forwarded message’ from the IIT of the August 2 email to him and Ashraf informed the court that his plea for a PDF copy of the ‘sent mail’ was denied.

While many CBSE schools have started JEE and Neet coaching in the recent years, highlighting students who have cleared these exams have also become way to attract admission. Since admission activities are mostly carried through school websites owing to Covid-19, it has become a tool for promotional activities.

A random visit to a CBSE school website shows a window popping out showing pictures of students who have cleared JEE (mains) 2020. Congratulating students for their achievement, the message also asks parents to kickstart education of their toddlers on Vijayadashami.

Mala Siva Kumar, principal of Kamala Niketan CBSE school, said, “Since we give dedicated coaching for NEET and JEE, we release the outcome of coaching by publishing students who clear the exams. However, board examination is our priority and we highlight students who score well in board examination as well.”

“Though only a section of the students opt for coaching, taking up JEE and NEET have become a trend over the recent years. We want students to understand their capabilities and not blindly opt for these entrance examinations just because their friends have opted for it,” said principal of another CBSE school in the city, adding, “such coaching is ideal for students who are really focused and want to get into these respective fields because only such students get through.”

A CBSE school teacher said that unless students are fully thorough in NCERT syllabus, they cannot clear competitive exams like JEE or NEET.

NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has removed temporary encroachments from Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar with the help of local police on Saturday. The action was taken on the directions of Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority ( EPCA ) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee ( DPCC ).

Officials said that the area has been identified among hotspots for increasing pollution levels especially in winters and EPCA has given advance direction to take measures for mitigating dust pollution.

“Since the area belongs to the civic body, we were leading the drive and the encroachments were removed in a joint action by the licensing, engineering, horticulture and health department of Civil Lines zone. A total of 55 temporary kiosks from pavements, 15 trucks parked in the ‘no parking zone’ were removed with the help of cranes. Seized material were taken to the corporation’s store,” said a north corporation official.

“Unlike residential areas, open sites are available and often used by trucks for parking purposes illegally. They are also being parked on roadsides. Similarly, kiosks or temporary hutments are constructed after damaging the pavement or road sides leading to pollution in the area. Considering it to be a sensitive area, members of EPCA visited the place in the past and after that direction was issued to strengthen the measures in view of upcoming winters. Also, tendering is done for construction of roads in the area but we are taking additional measures to avoid dust pollution,” said the official.

About 2,700 square meters of road was cleared. The department said that the action will be intensive in the coming days in other areas, especially those mentioned as pollution hotspots.

Delhi government has identified 13 pollution hotspots in the city based on the annual average of PM10 and PM2.5 levels — Okhla Phase-II, Dwarka, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, R K Puram and Jahangirpuri. The civic and other agencies have started working on plans to cover these areas.

Wooden toys of Natungram, terra cotta toys of Panchmura, clay toys of Ghurni and dokra toys and artefacts of Bikna are all well known.

395,['27/09/2020'],Power equipment makers eye biz from RE projects,"Vadodara: Their business had been plummeting over the last few years with power distribution companies (DISCOMs) in other states closing doors and pursuing protection policies for their local manufacturers. Combined with this, the Covid-19 pandemic and a sharp fall in orders from Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL) brought power equipment manufacturers in Gujarat almost on their knees. Despite the crisis they are going through, Vadadora, which is a national hub for the sector, finds power equipment entrepreneurs upbeat and looking for their place in the sun.The proposed solar and wind hybrid park in Kutch, billed as the world’s largest renewable power generation project at a single location, has brought new rays of hope for the industry in Gujarat. The state government has recently begun the process of allotting about 50,000 hectares of land in the district to various power producers for solar and wind projects. The state-run NTPCs have already firmed up plans for a 5,000 MW ultra-mega solar plant in Kutch.Besides the NTPCs project, the Kutch hybrid park, with a proposed capacity of about 28,000MW, will also house projects of Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL), Sarjan Realities, Gujarat Industries Power Company Ltd (GIPCL) and Gujarat Electricity Corporation Limited (GSECL). Of the 10,000MW capacity being planned by AGEL, 8,000MW will be solar and rest will be of wind, said sources.Many power equipment manufacturers said that the park will generate considerable business for them and help in turning around the fate of the sector that is facing a slump in the state.“When work on the park begins, there will be a huge demand for power equipment products. Vadodara, being home to hundreds of manufacturers, will benefit a lot from the project. We are expecting significant business,” said Harshyam Jadeja, president, Gujarat Electrical Equipment Manufacturers Association (GEEMA) that has 300 members from the state. GEEMA, however, feels that the government should keep a quota for the local manufacturers.Jadeja said Vadodara is home to 90% of power equipment manufacturers in the state, and they are sufficiently equipped to supply quality products. GEEMA also plans to write to the government seeking reservation in orders for the local firms.“Most power equipment makers in the state used to get a major part of their business from GUVNL. But the state is now 100% electrified, and hence the demand for new power equipment has gone down. The Gujarat government is giving a lot of facilities and land for the Kutch renewable energy park. It will surely help revive the power equipment industry in the state. But the state government should ensure that local manufacturers get more business from the park,” said Shailesh Patel, managing director, Topline Switchgears Pvt Ltd, Ahmedabad.Just four years ago, the city boasted of commanding about 30% of the country’s power equipment manufacturing business. Power products including transformers, cables and switchgears made in Vadodara were supplied to industries across the country. But many state governments introduced protection policies for their local manufacturers and gave them most of the business, leaving the power equipment makers from Gujarat high and dry.Sources in the industry said due to fall in demand for their products and intense competition for GUVNL business, some SMEs in Vadodara are even mulling to close down their facilities within a year. “When we run a business, such disruptions are expected. The power equipment manufacturers from Gujarat can look to the solar power products as it is a sunrise industry,” said Nimish Phadke, director of Comfort InstaPower Ltd that makes power equipment.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/power-equipment-makers-eye-biz-from-re-projects/articleshow/78341314.cms

397,['27/09/2020'],Rains continue as T sees wettest year in decade,"Hyderabad: City witnessed its third wettest day of September in the last 10 years after it received an average rainfall of 59.6 mm up to 8.30am on Saturday. This was followed by another 7.3 mm of rainfall between 8.30am and 8.30pm on Saturday.

As per IMD (Hyderabad), the city had received a record rainfall of 153.2 mm on September 27, 1908. Over the last decade, the city received highest rainfall of 90.2 mm on September 6, 2017, and 73.1 mm on September 23, 2016. Torrential rains led to a sharp drop in mercury levels with the maximum temperature recorded seven degree below normal at 24.8 degree Celsius. Minimum temperature recorded was 21.1 degree Celsius, normal for this time of the year. Meteorologists attribute sudden downpour to weather conditions becoming favourable for withdrawal of southwest monsoon from northern parts of country

“When the weather becomes favourable for withdrawal of the southwest monsoon in the northern parts of the country, all weather systems such as depression, trough shift southwards and towards the central region. Due to this, states like Telangana and Madhya Pradesh receive heavy rainfall during September-end,” said Rama Rao, consultant meteorologist, Telangana State Development Planning Society.

Over a 24-period (8.30 am on Friday to 8.30 am on Saturday), south Hasthinapuram received the highest rainfall of 133.8 mm followed by 99 mm at Kandikal Gate and 90.5 mm at Lingojiguda. Many other areas received 60-100 mm rain in a span of 24 hours. Heavy rains started lashing the city late Friday evening and continued for the second consecutive day.

On Saturday, Patancheru received the highest rainfall of 72.5 mm followed by 65.8 mm at Madhapur till 9 pm. Many areas in the western corridor such as KPHB, Lingampally and Gachibowli received rainfall of up to 40 mm.

Following Saturday’s incessant showers, meteorologists forecast that light to moderate thunderstorms will continue for the next two days and heavy rains might make a comeback by September 29. While withdrawal of the southwest monsoon from Rajasthan is expected to commence by September 28, withdrawal from Telangana is likely by October 8-10.

398,['27/09/2020'],Case filed as actor’s ‘manager’ dupes many,"Mumbai: Oshiwara police recently registered a case of impersonation and cheating against a person who was using social media to dupe people after posing as actor Sonu Sood. The cyber fraudster makes calls to victims, asking them to fill an online form and pay a processing fee of around Rs1,700 for help from Sood.

The actor said he did not want to punish the fraudster but help him get a job and get on the right path.

Bollywood actor Vishal Lamba came across a victim and filed a complaint with Oshiwara police on Thursday. Lamba said, “The person got a call from a fraudster who claimed he was Sood’s manager and told the victim if he wanted help from Sood, he would have to deposit Rs1,700 into a bank account as processing fees. The fraudster stopped receiving calls after the victim deposited the money.”

Sood told TOI, “Fraudsters are misusing my name. They are telling people to fill a form and pay processing fees to get financial aid, jobs or other help. Those in dire state during lockdown are being duping. We are getting several complaints. I have been posting on social media that people must not believe such calls. The fraudster may have duped many using my name.”

Sood even posted on social media messages urging the fraudsters that if they were in need of money, they can contact him and will arrange good jobs for them but they must not cheat the needy. “I have helped fraudsters from Bihar get on the right track after they were caught. My intention is not to punish, but to show the right path to these fraudsters. In one case, a woman who needed an ambulance for her mother was told to deposit Rs8,000-10,000 by someone who said that he was from my team. The woman deposited the money but did not get an ambulance, because of which her mother died. I learnt about the incident and we helped her,” he said.

Police have zeroed in on details of the fraudster and action will be initiated soon. Senior inspector Dayanand Bangar said they have registered a case and are contacting victims.

Sood has helped over 20,000 migrants reunite with families in Jharkhand, Assam, Bihar or Odisha by arranging buses, trains, and in some case plane tickets.

LUDHIANA: At a time when people are talking about adopting stray dogs , especially when Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged to focus more on the adoption of Indian breeds, the story of 45-year-old Puja Rani, who is taking care of 200 dogs at her shelter home in Khasi Kalan village on Tajpur Road, deserves appreciation.

Rani, with the help of a few animal lovers, has been providing shelter to stray dogs and cats for the last seven years. She also provide shelter to pet dogs when their pet parents are not around.

Talking about her journey with TOI, Rani said she had an exceptional attachment with animals ever since she was a kid. While describing her journey, she said, “Since my childhood days, I was having special attachment with animals and I could not see them in pain. Initially, I had kept 30-35 dogs at my home but when people objected about barking of these dogs, I set up a shelter home at Khasi Kalan in an open area so that nobody should get disturbed.” She said she fed these dogs and cats and they were living with her with great love and affection.

She said people keep on calling her about stray dogs in various areas and she brings those dogs at this shelter home. “Every dog has it’s own story and I have given names to all dogs,” she said while adding that these dogs remain with her like kids. Regarding expenses on the food and medicine of these dogs and cats she said, “I have support of some good people who donate money for the upkeep of dogs and for medicine also I put message in the group and people give medicines. Also one leading bread company is giving bread for these dogs free of cost.” She said they are soon going to establish an NGO where there would be place for more dogs.

About her personal life, she said she had one son and her house was in Laxman Nagar. She said her daughter-in-law had left her son because she had a problem with these dogs and now only she and her son were there in family. She said her son took away seven dogs from the dog shelter and he was taking care of them at home while she remained most of the time at the shelter. She said she does not leave these dogs alone.

While giving a message to other people she said people should not hate dogs or other animals because even these are creation of God like human beings. “The problem of stray dogs can be resolved only when all people will take responsibility of these creatures at least in their areas. If you give food to the dogs or other animals they will always remain loyal to you, so start loving them.”

402,['27/09/2020'],Deadlock between minister &amp; official continues; both write to CS,"Dehradun: The rift between state minister Rekha Arya and IAS V Shanmugam refuses to be resolved as both of them wrote letters to Uttarakhand's chief secretary ( CS ) on Saturday to explain their respective stands.

Taking cognisance of the tussle, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had tasked additional chief secretary Manisha Panwar to probe into the matter. However, Arya has expressed her apprehensions over the fairness of the probe, saying that an inquiry by an IAS officer involving another IAS officer will hardly be impartial. She added that she will quit politics if found guilty in the matter.

“I completely respect the decision of the CM but at the same time I have doubts as an IAS officer is probing a matter linked with another IAS officer. It would have been better if a retired High Court judge would have led the probe,” Arya told reporters.

In her letter to the CS, Arya has highlighted the issue of a tender process to finalise an outsource agency which provided jobs to 350-400 persons in different projects of the women empowerment and child development department. The minister maintained that the department did not take the matter seriously and though the time period of the selected agency expired in May 2020, the process of finalising an agency could not be completed timely.

Citing a number of other issues linked to the matter, she said that the decisions taken by Shanmugam, who is the director of the department, caused a major setback to around 400 outsourced employees who had not been paid for the past few months.

On the other hand, sources pointed out that Shanmugam too has written a three-page letter to the CS apprising him of various facts, including his decision of self-isolation.

Notably, Arya had written to Dehradun district DIG on September 22, alleging that Shanmugam had “gone missing and might have been kidnapped” as he was not responding to her calls. However, the Dehradun police team found that the IAS officer was under self-isolation.

Yavatmal: Members of Kisan Sabha and unemployed youths from Mahagaon and Umarkhed tehsils of Yavatmal staged a rasta roko on Nagpur-Tulzapur national highway on Saturday at village Mudana to press for their demands.

They were demanding fresh crop loan from banks on par with State Bank of India after taking an undertaking from eligible farmers.DB Naik, Devidas Mohakar and Arjun Rathod led the protest.

The protest led to traffic snarl on the highway. The protest was called off after senior bank officials met the agitators and reportedly promised to solve their problems by Monday. Earlier, women protested by begging in front of Union Bank of India’s Mudana branch and Central Bank branch at Fulsavangi village.

A few days ago, a farmer’s delegation led by farm activist Manish Jadhav had met with RDC Lalitkumar Warhade to demand immediate survey for damage caused to soyabean crop due to heavy rain in July and September.

Taking cognisance of a TOI report, guardian minister Sanjay Rathod had ordered the district administration and agriculture department to start the survey immediately and submit a report to the state government for necessary action to grant compensation to affected farmers.

The minister on Saturday toured Madkona village and inspected damage caused to soyabean crop at farm of one Dinesh Gothe. He promised to take up the issue in the cabinet meeting scheduled on Wednesday. The minister also pointed out that similar situation was prevailing in Amravati, Buldhana and Wardha districts.

The minister also visited the ‘Poly house’ of farmer Sachin Jirapure where he is growing flowers that are sent to Nagpur, Yavatmal and Amravati. He earns Rs12,000 per day from the flowers. The minister urged farmers to follow Jirapure and adopt modern technology to increase their income.

All teachers from state-run and aided schools will have to regularly update what they have been teaching through the week, how many students attended class and if they made calls or home visits for students not connected online.

In a circular on Friday, the department said teachers must submit a weekly report of remote learning programmes. They have to register on the portal and update details.

The decision has not gone down well with teachers. “The government has not provided training on to teach online but is expecting us to submit reports. Not all teachers have access to a computer or internet, and this exercise will only add to a teacher’s non-academic work,” said Teachers’ Democratic Front vice-president Rajesh Pandya.

Uday Nare, a teacher from Hansraj Morarji Public School, Andheri, said it was unfair to burden teachers. “We submit reports to school heads. We are constantly making extra efforts to reach out to as many children as possible, and are job has only got more difficult during the pandemic. Why does the government constantly seek reports only from teachers?”

NEW DELHI: As part of the #MySocietyPride initiative , TOI on Friday evening organised its second virtual town hall in the capital where East Delhi Municipal Corporation ( EDMC ) chief engineer (headquarter) Pradeep Khandelwal, deputy director (horticulture) Narpat Singh and technical expert Arun Kumar answered several questions related to civic and infrastructure issues in east Delhi during an hour-long session.

The following are some of the major issues that the residents of IP Extension, Shakarpur, Mayur Vihar and Vasundhara Enclave raised during the town hall.

Our society came up in 1978 and the Ghazipur landfill in 1984. We were not told at the time of allotting land that a landfill close to IP Extension and a huge nullah at the rear of the apartment would come up later. For the sake of our health, we demand their immediate removal. Dinesh Walia, president, Indraprastha Apartments

It was decades back when the garbage site was identified in Ghazipur. We are making all efforts to reduce the height of the landfill and process the legacy waste through biomining. As far as nullah is concerned, most of the major drains were developed before 1976. We can’t change their route and not even cover them as per NGT’s order. But their desilting is being done regularly. Pradeep Khandelwal, chief engineer

Is structural audit compulsory for all societies? If yes, why not rates are fixed for the structural audit? Puneet Chandra, Deshbandhu Society, Mayur Vihar

Structural audit of the societies that have come up before 2000 is made mandatory. We have already served notices to societies and shared a list of empanelled engineers who can do the job. It is impossible to fix a common rate for the audit. Still, we will follow up the matter with Indian Association of Structural Engineers. Pradeep Khandelwal

Sanitation workers don’t have tippers or trolleys to collect the waste and there have been instances where the garbage is not lifted for days. Chandra Prakash Suryavanshi, Samaj Kalyan Parishad RWA, Shakarpur

We have recently given tender for door-to-door collection of segregated garbage to a private concessionaire. Similarly, arrangements to lift waste from roadsides have been beefed up and residents will soon see the difference. Arun Kumar, technical expert, EDMC

Pruning of trees has not been done for the past many years. Jag Mohan, secretary, Saini Co-op House Building Society Ltd

We can’t cut trees or their branches without taking permission from the forest department. It will be better if the residents simultaneously write to both the departments so that a joint inspection can be conducted and if permission is granted, we can take action. Narpat Singh, deputy director, horticulture department

Encroachment on roads has increased due to illegal hawkers and haphazard parking. SR Sangar, secretary, Federation of Indraprastha Extension Housings Societies

Due to Covid pandemic, action on the ground was affected. But now, we will again intensify the drives. Arun Kumar

LUDHIANA: Local resident Pawan Kumar arrested by Sangrur police for cyber fraud, which was being operated from Jamtara of Jharkhand, was the person who was receiving the entire cash fraudulently being transferred from the accounts of victims. According to police, the network of the accused was spread across the country. The police say that Pawan and his accomplice Noor Ali of Mandi Gobindgarh were just matriculates.

On September 19, Sangrur police arrested Pawan of Subhash Nagar, Jodhewal area, and his accomplice Noor Ali of Mandi Gobindgarh for being involved in inter-state cyber frauds. The police have also recovered Rs 7.60 lakh and two mobile phones from their possession.

Investigating officer Sangrur DSP Mohit Aggarwal told TOI, “Basically, it is a gang which used to call people by impersonating as bank officials, claiming the customers that their KYC (know your customer) is pending. They also got the internet banking details and then would make people download QS Teamviewer app in their mobiles on pretest of certain verifications. This particular app gives access of your mobile phone to the fraudster. After downloading the application they used to ask people to switch off their mobile phones and during that time they would transfer money from their accounts.”

“Noor Ali is the kingpin of this cyber fraud in Punjab . During investigations, the police have identified that each member of their team had a different task. Like they had one person who was a data provider. He steals data, like names and mobile phone numbers of people, from different websites and sold it to fraudsters. One gang member sitting in Jamtara, Jharkhand, made all calls and money was transferred to the account of another gang member. Then the money was again transferred to the e-wallet of Noor Ali and further to Pawan Kumar,” added the DSP.

On asking how many people from Ludhiana or Punjab have been targeted by the gang, DSP Aggarwal said, “The accused played smart to avert their arrest. If the fraud call was being made from Jharkhand, the victim would be from down south region and the money would be withdrawn from Punjab or other north regions. Thus, the fraudsters made it difficult for the police to visit so many states and investigate the case. Moreover, due to Covid-19 it has become more difficult. So, when the money was being received by Pawan Kumar in Ludhiana, then the victim was not from the same region. If they have duped people of Ludhiana or Punjab then the money would be sent to their gang members sitting in other states. Further investigation is on to trace their accomplices.”

The police have also identified that both the arrested accused have their hometown in Jamtara, therefore they came in touch with each other.

Usage of cash collected

DSP Mohit Aggarwal said that Pawan Kumar used to receive the money in his e-wallet being used on a mobile phone purchased on Fake ID proofs. Pawan runs a mobile recharge shop in Subhash Nagar area. There he used to give offers to his customers for paying their electricity bills online with some discount. He used to make payment from the e-wallet for the electricity bills and used to get cash from the people. Further, the money was divided among all gang members.

How to escape being duped

The DSP said different applications and websites store your data like name and mobile phones when we use them and this cannot be stopped. The only way to escape is awareness. Even if fraudsters have your mobile number and name they cannot dupe you unless you provide further information like OTP or some password. Just remember that no bank official will ask for an OTP, passwords and would never ask to download any other application or a link to click on. If a caller asks for any of such details, he/she is a fraudster.

408,['27/09/2020'],Mumbai: Doctor whose patient died after fistula surgery told to pay Rs 14 lakh,"Image used for representational purpose only

MUMBAI: A consumer forum has ordered a Goregaon doctor to pay a compensation of Rs 14 lakh to the wife of a dialysis patient who died a month-and-a-half after an arteriovenous fistula surgery led to gangrene in his hand. It was clear that the death occurred due to gross negligence of the doctor, the consumer forum said.

It refuted Dr Shrikant M Badwe’s submission that as Alok Deshpande was being treated by many specialists during that period the fistula must have been infected. Observing that the defence was not convincing, it said material showed that from the time the fistula was implanted, Ashok complained of pain, and three days after the operation it was bleeding. It said records of another hospital where Alok was treated showed the pain and fever persisted for 15 days after surgery, and the hand had become gangrenous.

“This shows a direct nexus between creation of fistula and gangrene developed at the site of fistula, resulting in death of the patient. Conduct of the opponent is grossly negligent and unbecoming of a doctor,” it said.

Sandhya, who moved Mumbai Suburban District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum on November 19, 2014, said her husband underwent surgery on December 31, 2013 and died on February 19, 2014. She told the forum that though her husband was diabetic, the doctor did not perform any test confirming his blood sugar level before the operation.

The doctor denied the allegations and said he had taken care and diligence. He said that in 29 years of practice as one of the senior-most urologists and androgolists, he had done more than 3,000 AVF fistula surgeries for patients requiring dialysis and had the best track record. He said the complainant was damaging his reputation.

The forum said in no case one can expect a surgery to be 100% successful. “But the relationship of doctor and patient is of a fiduciary nature, so it is always expected that a medical practitioner should take reasonable care and precaution and perform necessary tests as circumstances demand. The doctor’s conduct falls short of this requirement. On account of lapse of duty, the fistula resulted in gangrene,” the forum said.

The number of people per raft has been capped and masks are mandatory. “Only four persons are permitted in a raft compared to eight people that were allowed pre-pandemic. Everyone has to wear a waterproof mask,” said Bhatt.Operators expect the number to increase in the coming days as October to November is peak season . The rafting business generates an average revenue of Rs 100 crore annually. At least 10,000 people are directly employed in the adventure sport in Rishikesh while 30,000 people are indirectly connected to it, said Bhatt.The state government had announced Rs 1,000 per month for registered tourism industry personnel but that had bought little cheer.

The cess was 0.7% on sale of goods worth Rs 100. Total earnings of APMCs from cess was Rs 800 crore a year. When the new law comes into force it will be Rs 300 crore a year,’’ a senior bureaucrat told TOI.Maharashtra has 305 APMCs, 598 subcommittees, with a turnover of Rs 45,681 crore and 7,000 employees. “If the new law comes into force, most APMCs will become unviable, as there will be less income, as most farmers will prefer to sell produce outside the jurisdiction of APMCs. Thus, APMCs’ income will reduce drastically,’’ he said.He said the biggest flaw in the new law was lack of provision for minimum support price (MSP). “If a trader buys produce cheaper than MSP, there is no mechanism to check it. There will be less protection for farmers, who are unorganized, while traders are well organized. Chances of exploitation of farmers are bright. If there is a complaint, it will be difficult for farmers to approach arbitrators. Small and marginal farmers will be worst hit,’’ he said.Even if farmers are freed from APMCs’ clutches, there are doubts if private traders will set up adequate infrastructure outside APMCs’ jurisdiction, as the central legislation is silent on it.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant alleged that NDA government is determined to destroy the agriculture sector. “We were expecting that in his policy statement (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi will speak on MSP for protection of farmers, but he maintained discreet silence. He must speak up,’’ Sawant said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78347154,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-194826,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/with-new-law-fate-of-300-apmcs-hangs-in-balance/articleshow/78340393.cms

Both forest department and police have registered offence and launched manhunt for the henchmen.

Official sources said that acting on a tip-off about illegal sand mining in nullah under compartment no. 494 of Ballarpur forest range , a team led by RFO Santosh Thipe raided the spot in the midnight and seized a tractor filled with sand. The driver and workers loading the tractor managed to flee.

The RFO told TOI that they were returning with the seized tractor when around 10 henchmen of sand mafia came on five bikes and surrounded them in the forest. “Armed with swords, knives, cudgels and stones, they threatened us with dire consequences and forced us to give up the tractor,” he said RFO. He claimed to have learnt about two names Rupesh Morey and Manoj Kshirsagar from the henchmen.

Thipe filed complaint with Ballarpur police station where offence was registered against Morey, Kshirsagar and others under relevant sections of IPC and Arms Act. Ballarpur forest range too has registered offence under different sections of forest laws.

Earlier in 2017, ACF Niranjan Talmale was assaulted, kidnapped and his service gun stolen by the sand mafia henchmen in Mul range for seizing illegally smuggled sand.

413,['27/09/2020'],DPCC gets cracking on pollution ahead of winter in Delhi,"Fines of Rs 3.1 crore have been imposed on RMC plants found to be violating dust norms

NEW DELHI: Delhi Pollution Control Committee has started cracking down on different sources of pollution in the capital ahead of the winter season.

An inspection of all ready mix concrete plants and construction sites with an area of more than 20,000 sqm was conducted this week and fines of Rs 3.1 crores have been imposed on RMC plants found to be violating dust norms. Construction sites violating norms, meanwhile, were fined Rs 80 lakh by DPCC .

Of the 93 RMC plants inspected, 54 were found to be operational, while 31 were found to not be taking adequate measures against dust pollution. DPCC said at 11 of these sites, directions have been issued to stop operations. “But in all 31 sites, notices to impose a penalty ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 20 lakh have been issued,” DPCC said in a statement on Saturday.

Officials said the violations at RMC plants included uncovered building materials, like sand and cement, unpaved roads leading to the working area, no sprinkling systems in place, uncovered conveyor belts and non-operational wheel-washing facilities.

“All RMC plants operating in Delhi have been provided with detailed guidelines to prevent dust emissions from all possible sources and if followed scrupulously, the possibility of dust generation will minimize. Accordingly, all RMC plants have also been directed to remove the deficiencies pointed out in each case, failing which the defaulting units will be closed down and there will be zero tolerance in this regard,” DPCC said on Saturday.

DPCC also inspected construction sites with an area of over 20,000 sqm and found three sites not using anti-smog guns, with their work halted until they install these guns. For violating and not following dust-control measures, eight sites have been issued notices with fines ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 20 lakh.

“The drive against construction sites has only begun and one-third of the sites have been covered so far. In the coming week, the remaining two-third sites will also be covered,” a DPCC official added.

PATNA: There could be more trouble in store for the opposition Mahagatbandhan over seat-sharing. After RLSP, now Congress has declared that it can go it alone and contest on all 243 seats if not given a ""respectable number of seats"".

The former general secretary of the All India Congress Committee and the party’s screening committee chairman for Bihar, Avinash Pandey, made it clear on Saturday that Congress will not compromise this time. The screening committee is tasked with selecting Congress candidates for the polls.

“We have prepared for all seats, and if we remain in alliance, then we will help our alliance partners on their seats. But all our leaders want respect, and if there is a lack of respect towards Congress or our party leaders, then we are ready to fight on all 243 seats,” Pandey said, even hinting at the Left parties joining hands with his party.

Though Pandey talked of a ""respectable number"" of seats, he did not spell out the exact figure that Congress wants for itself.

Pandey, who played a key role during assembly polls in Rajasthan as state incharge, said membership drives conducted by his party in Bihar and surveys done on seats have proved that the party has its strength in Bihar.

Asked if his party accepts RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as the alliance's chief minister candidate, Pandey said, “Every party has the right to choose its leader, and a party is not dependent on the face of one person.” However, he later clarified, “Definitely, they (RJD) are the major partner in the alliance and Congress will accept it (Tejashwi as CM face).”

Reacting to Pandey’s comment, RJD state Spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said every party prepares for all seats and they too have done their preparation on 243 seats in Bihar. “Even though we prepare on all seats, in alliance we support candidates of all the partners from wherever they are contesting. Talks are going on with Congress in a smooth way and soon everything will be clear.” However he added they will be giving respect to all and expected the same respect from others too.

On RLSP leader Upendra Kushwaha, who recently raised questions over Tejashwi’s leadership, and is all set to leave the alliance, Pandey said, “We respect him, and we wish all the forces to come together against the 15 years of misgovernment in Bihar and the BJP. We are fighting for the betterment of Bihar.”

Pandey, who has come for two days to Patna with two other team members of the screening committee, said the party will give a chance to those who have been with Congress for long and hardworking candidates who believe in the ideology of the party.

He then hit out at the NDA government at the Centre over border issues with China and the farm bills that have led to farmers' agitation across the country. He also attacked CM Nitish Kumar for doing away with the agriculture produce market committee (APMC) and said others should learn a lesson on how farmers in Bihar are now suffering.

Pandey said, ""The Bihar election will be a revolution and will also decide the fate of PM Modi.""

Apart from conducting closed-door meetings with senior Bihar leaders on Saturday, Pandey also held a meeting with the members of various committees of the state Congress.

416,['27/09/2020'],Delhi CM writes to Centre for backing stubble chemical,"Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar on Saturday to endorse a chemical developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute scientists for managing crop stubble, which is currently burnt and causes heavy pollution in Delhi-NCR.

Kejriwal had sought an appointment with Javadekar, but unable to meet him for two days, decided instead to write to him. “Soon smoke caused by stubble burning will present a problem before us. I wanted to meet you in this regard. But you may think why now when it's already very late. Why did I not meet you earlier? Its because recently IARI scientists got in touch with me. They informed me that they have hit on an easy and affordable solution for this,” Kejriwal said in the letter, attaching with it the letter of IARI director Dr A K Singh.

Admitting there was little time for the intervention this year, Kejriwal said some stubble might even now be prevented. “Even in the limited time, the farmers of the nearby states should be encouraged to use the (IARI) solution,” Kejriwal wrote, adding that Delhi government would employ the new technique to ensure no stubble was burnt in the capital.

Kejriwal reported that a chemical developed by IARI decomposed crop remnants into manure. “The farmers wouldn’t need to burn the stubble. The scientists believe that stubble burning kills the good bacteria in the soil and reduces its fertility. But the use of the chemical to turn stubble into manure will reduce the need of fertiliser, and the soil quality and productivity will increase,” Kejriwal said, advocating the IARI innovation as an effective solution to stubble burning.

Kejriwal observed that everyone was currently focused on innovating machines to deal with stubble, but the costs involved had deterred farmers from taking to such machines. “The IARI technique involves only a negligible cost for farmers. If the fertiliser benefit of this technique is calculated, the farmers will enjoy a net profit,” the letter said.

IARI has developed an innovative bio-decomposer technique to deal with the problem of ridding the fields of rice harvest stubble. The chemical determined by the institute can be sprayed in the fields after the harvest and before the fields are prepared for the wheat sowing. The spraying hastens the decomposition of biomass into manure that reinvigorates the soil and reduces the need for fertilisers. Kejriwal had reviewed the innovation at IARI on Thursday.

Many patients are forced to use unhygienic toilets. There are unsanitary conditions prevailing at the Haveri district Covid ward A Covid patient who was admitted in the Gadag Covid hospital said, “The Covid ward is just like hell. Hygiene is not being maintained and there are unsanitary conditions prevailing. A total 30 patients share a single toilet in the ward, and there is a foul odour emanating from it, which troubles patients. “The staff clean the ward only once a day, which is why it is so dirty. We have appealed to the authorities to take some action in this regard, but to no avail,” he said.“The group ‘D’ employees are not maintaining the washbasin as well. Water leaks from the tap, and there is a faulty water connection to the ward. The unhygienic environment has further complicated the recovery of Covid patients and put them at great risk. Despite making frequent appeals in this regard to the authorities, we have got no response,” said another patient admitted in the Haveri Covid hospital.Somashekhar Patil, who has recovered from Covid-19 in Ranebennur, said that he recovered as he was in home isolation, because he didn’t want to be admitted to the Covid hospital due to the poor hygiene there.

421,['27/09/2020'],Government promotes cashew cultivation through MGNREGS,"MYSURU: Cashew production has become stagnant across the country and to increase it, the Centre has modified the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme allowing farmers to take up plantation in their lands from this year.

The department of horticulture will provide farmers saplings, material along with labour cost, sources told TOI.

After Mysuru betel leaf, farmers in the district can take up cashew plantation under MGNREGS.

The Union government is encouraging farmers to take up several horticultural crops under MGNREGS apart from National Horticulture Mission schemes by including papaya, drumsticks, coconut, banana, mango, guava and other local specific plantation crops like rubber from this year.

Deputy director of horticulture Dr BT Rudresh told TOI that farmers having job cards issued by local gram panchayats can take up plantation especially in dry lands, areas with degraded soil and marginal land as such land is good for cultivation of cashew.

The department will provide farmers up to 400 saplings per acre after purchasing them from cashew cultivation areas of Kodagu, Kolar, Dakshina Kannada and Belagavi.

Dr Rudresh said farmers can get assistance up to a maximum of Rs 80,000 per acre for buying saplings, other material and for labour. He said that the department has received many enquiries for cashew cultivation from HD Kote, Hunsur, Periyapatna and Nanjangud taluks.

Yield from third year

The high-yielding H-30 variety saplings will be supplied to farmers. Farmers can plant up to 600 saplings in their land depending upon space. Though the cashew plants will start flowering within a year of plantation, they will start yielding only from the third year. The hybrid variety of plant will yield nuts weighing 12- 13 grams. Farmers can harvest 18 to 23 kilograms of nuts from each tree per year and an acre of cashew plantation can produce 1,300kg nuts per year, officials said.

423,['27/09/2020'],Walls turn into blackboards to beat internet woes,"Ranchi: With poor students of government schools suffering because of the lack of resources for online education, the headmaster of an upgraded middle school at Dumarthar, a remote tribal village 40km from Dumka, has come up with an innovative idea to ensure children continue learning without compromising with Covid-19 safety norms.

Principal Sapan Kumar said despite the government launching schemes -- like DigiSaath – to augment online education infrastructure, all academic activities for 290 children from the four villages covered by the school had come to a complete halt due to poor internet connectivity and the inability of the students to buy smartphones.

Left without an option, he converted the walls of mud houses in the village into blackboards so that students could sit beside them while he and other three teachers walked around taking classes. Kumar said, “The students could not access online content due to lack of internet services and it wasn’t possible for us to go to each student’s house so we decided to hold classes for them in groups at their homes, using the walls as blackboards.”

Now, each student has a separate blackboard outside their home and they has been provided with a stock of chalk and duster to write out their tasks or ask questions. Wearing their uniform, they sit beside these boards at a distance from each other and attend classes as per schedule. The teachers assign one of the blackboards for themselves and read out lessons and clear doubts on microphones connected to speakers.

Four teachers, including Kumar, conduct the classes in rotation for students of Class IV to VIIII in batches of 50 students each while the education of younger children are being looked after by educated villagers due to an acute shortage of teachers.

This unique approach worked and children are attending classes with enthusiasm. “Tribal children have an inherent inclination towards wall paintings – Sohrai, Khovar and other many wall art forms are rooted in adivasi culture — and we decided use this for their learning. The idea was an instant success and children started paying more attention to what was being taught,” Kumar said.

Kumar has named his initiative ‘Shiksha Aapke Dwar Samuday ke Sath (bringing school to the doorsteps with community help)’ and the effort has been recognized and applauded by chief minister Hemant Soren and Niti Aayog.

To help readers cope with their anxieties in these stressful times, The Times of India has launched Talk it Out, a series under which our panel of expert counsellors will answer your mental health queries. This week’s advice comes from psychologist Dr Shachee DalviIt’s possible that due to painful past experiences , you are unable to trust your present friends. But try to have faith in those who you feel can understand you. Even a single close friend with whom you can shed inhibitions is enough. Once you have this, your involvement with strangers will vanish too. Till the time you find that good friend, I suggest you vent out your feelings in a diary, or in front of a mirror when you’re alone as this is important to get rid of your negative feelings. This will bring down your aggression and frustration too. Think about positive things . Remember, in any relationship, it’s very important to accept a person as s/he is. This will make life much easier and your relationships harmonious.My faith in marriage has been shattered after I discovered my husband of 18 years having an affair during the lockdown. I don’t feel like staying with him, but we have a daughter aged 13 for whom I have to pretend that everything is normal. But each passing day is like hell. I feel I am going into depression. Nothing interests me. I want to kill myself.Please help.Since you have a teenaged daughter — and only if you want this — you can try talking to your husband and see if there’s any chance of reconciliation. Otherwise I would suggest stepping out of the marriage because if you are trapped and unhappy, how can you make it work or make your daughter happy? Kindly do not think about what society or people will say — they won’t help or guide you in times of difficulty. Think only about your and your daughter’s happiness. Remember, life is beautiful, and no person or painful experience is worth ending it. One can get out of any negative circumstances through determination and willpower and be happy. If suicidal thoughts persist, please get professional help.Try to explain to your parents that while they are important to you and their decision matters, it is you who has to spend the rest of your life with the person. So, it’s crucial that your happiness is taken into consideration. Tell them that ultimately all parents wish for their child’s happiness and security, and the boy will take care of you just like them. Most importantly, go with a positive mindset and ignore any doubts and fears. If possible, make the boy speak to your parents as soon as you have this conversation. I am sure they will understand and support you.I empathise with you. Both men and women should have equal rights and opportunities, and happiness is the foremost need of every individual. Try explaining to your husband that you aren’t at all happy leading this life, as one needs to have a purpose in life which in turn leads to happiness. Tell him that if you aren’t happy, you can’t make him happy or make the marriage work. Talk to him about your interests and goals in life and also assure him that pursuing them doesn’t mean you will ignore him. This will contribute to the overall happiness and peace of the house. Hopefully he understands you.Sharing can help your recovery so write to us at talkitout@timesgroup.com with your question, name and place.

They hit Barnwal on the head with pistol butt and fled with the jewellery and the DVR of the CCTV footage in bags they had brought with them. The profusely bleeding shopkeeper raised an alarm for help, but the criminals escaped.Dhanbad SSP Asim Vikrant Minz reached the spot with DSP (law and order) Mukesh Kumar and launched an investigation. They are also searching for the footage cameras installed at nearby to identify the criminals. Sources at the Bank More police station, barely 50 meters from the shop, said the precision with which the robbery was committed indicates it is the handiwork of professional criminals.While the district administration is trying to implement guidelines regarding masks and face shields to stop spread of coronavirus, it has become a tool in the hands of miscreants who are using it to conceal their identity while committing crimes.

Former MLA Radha Krishna Kishore , who resigned from BJP to join Ajsu Party before last year’s assembly election in Jharkhand, met Lalu at Kelly’s Bungalow on Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences ( Rims ) campus on Saturday, said, “Even though I met him only to enquire about his health, Laluji was upbeat about the polls and expressed hope that RJD will perform better than the previous election.”

Lalu has been admitted to Rims for various ailments and was shifted to the plush bungalow in August in view of the coronavirus outbreak. Claiming that the visit was personal, Kishore said, “I was a member of the Bihar legislative assembly when Lalu and later his wife Rabri Devi were the chief ministers. No political discussion took place at the meeting and I found Laluji in reasonably good health.”

Earlier in the day, JMM MLA Sita Soren, the widowed daughter-in-law of party president Shibu Soren, met Lalu in what she said was a personal visit. Sita said Lalu’s and her family have close relations. When asked whether she discussed the upcoming elections, she said Shibu and CM Hemant Soren are handling the issue. “However, I am ready to campaign in Bihar if required,” she said.

Hemant had also visited Lalu at the bungalow recently and his party is gearing up to contest on 12 seats in Bihar as a part of the mahagatbandhan with RJD and Congress.

Politicians, particularly from Bihar, have been queuing up at Kelly’s Bungalow for the past several weeks with the jail administration lifting the restriction on Lalu’s meetings with outsiders that was imposed in view of the pandemic. Now, three persons are allowed to meet him every Saturday while following all safety norms.

More will also need financial assistance as her immune-suppressants and physiotherapy alone would cost Rs 20,000 a month.More registered for a transplant two years back but couldn’t get any donors. “Hands are an external organ and families are reluctant to donate them,” said Dr Satbhai.More’s luck changed when a software professional’s family agreed to donate his hands after he was declared brain dead in Global Hospital, Chennai. Her transplant lasted 16 hours and she was kept in a separate room for the next four weeks to reduce the risk of Covid. She could speak to her family only on video chat.“She was given physiotherapy twice a day along with breathing and shoulder exercises. She initially had a plaster slab above the elbow to support the bones, and will need splints for more than a month now,” said the doctor.More will be able to move her fingers after three months when the nerves heal. “I will have to stay home and avoid visitors as I am on immunosuppressants. I can only travel between home and hospital,” said More.More added, “Earlier, I would avoid attending functions or weddings as I couldn’t apply mehendi on my hands. But after my hands get functional, I will apply mehendi, paint, and do activities such as eating, bathing, combing hair, and cooking on my own. I always wanted to become independent and I am happy that I will be able to do so.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78342388,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-159605,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-monika-more-goes-home-her-doctors-get-24-hand-transplant-inquiries/articleshow/78342382.cms
434,['27/09/2020'],Medical oxygen price capped for 6 months,"NEW DELHI: Amid rising demand for medical oxygen which is essential in treatment of moderate to severe Covid-19 patients, the pharmaceutical pricing regulator has capped the price of medical oxygen cylinders and liquid medical oxygen (LMO) for six months to ensure availability of medical oxygen at stable rates.

While issuing the order, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) said the high price of LMO was impacting operational viability of fillers, creating a supply shortage . The demand for medical oxygen has increased up to almost four times from 750 MT per day to around 2,800 MT per day after the the Covid outbreak. Around 6% of around 9.6 lakh currently “active” Covid cases need oxygen support.

Many states are dependent on the medical oxygen supply from other states. NPPA has fixed the ex-factory price of LMO at manufacturers end at Rs 15.2 per cubic metre exclusive of GST; and further capped the ex-factory cost of medical oxygen cylinder at filler end at Rs 25.7 per cubic metre (again exclusive of GST) in suppression of the existing ceiling price of Rs 17.49 per cubic metre, subject to transportation cost fixation at state level, for six months.

“It is informed that due to increase in price of LMO being supplied to filler, the margins for them have been squeezed and are impacting their operational viability. Due to excess demand, delivery through cylinders has increased from 11% pre-Covid to 50% of current oxygen supply. It is therefore, imperative to cap price of LMO to ensure uninterrupted availability of Medical Oxygen though cylinders to the hospitals and consumers,” the order said. The government has said there is no shortage of supply but the variation in cases indicates that there might be localised demands.

The decision is based on recommendations of an Empowered Group of Secretaries looking into issues related to availability and pricing of oxygen.

435,['27/09/2020'],AP: Private hospitals request to be relieved of Covid-19 duties,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Private hospitals notified for Covid-19 treatment are now asking the state government to de-notify them starting October and appealing to be allowed to resume regular services. The plea comes in light of government hospitals taking most of the Covid-19 treatment pressure and few coming to private hospitals for treatment.Representatives of private hospitals claim that the number of Covid-19 cases has come down since August. Moreover, most new Covid-19 patients have mild symptoms not requiring hospitalisation. Awareness about the Rs 300 Covid-19 treatment put out by state Covid-19 special officer Dr C Prabhakar Reddy has also helped in lowering the number of patients approaching private hospitals for treatment, they say.Private hospitals claim that patients with other health conditions are not daring to approach the private hospitals that have been notified for Covid-19 treatment. This has significantly impacted their revenue. Further, private hospitals claims that they have lost a bulk of their regular patients who used to make monthly visits.A source at Gitam Hospital said, “We only have only 80 Covid-19 patients at our hospitals from more than 400 in August.” According to another representative of a private hospital, nearly four private hospitals which were notified for Covid-19 treatment in Maharanipeta have requested the government to be de-notified.The power to de-notify private hospitals lies with district collectors. Srikakulam district collector J Nivas said that he understands that many private Covid-19 hospitals want to start regular treatment as it is becoming unviable for them to treat the few Covid-19 patients approaching them. “We have been given full powers to take a decision on de-notification of private hospitals. But it is too early to decide,” he said.Speaking to TOI, Dr KS Jawahar Reddy, the special chief secretary of the department of health and family welfare said, “We have not issued any official notification for de-notification of private Covid-19 hospitals in the state so far. Yes, the Covid-19 situation has been brought under control in the state. The positivity rate too has come down to around 11% now from nearly 17% mid-August.”",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78345180,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-257754,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/private-hospitals-request-to-be-relieved-of-covid-19-duties/articleshow/78339788.cms
436,['27/09/2020'],Industries gasping for oxygen in Maharashtra,"MUMBAI: With no oxygen for industrial use in Nashik, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, many industries are closing down sections that use it, while others such as fabrication will shut completely till the situation normalises.

Pimpri-Chinchwad Small Industries Association, in a letter to the state government, demanded that a 100-tonne oxygen plant for industrial use be set up immediately in Pune. Association president Sandeep Belsare said there are 35,000 small, medium and large industries in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Chakan and Talegaon. An oxygen cylinder is available with much difficulty in the black market for Rs 900-1,000, he said. Around 400 tonnes of oxygen is required daily for industrial use, said Belsare.

“We have come to a point where industries are shutting down sections or entire fabrication, plastic units for want of oxygen. The government must on a war-footing set up a 100-tonne oxygen plant in Pune exclusively for industrial use,” he said.

In Sinnar , the steel industry hub in Nashik, production had been hit badly, said Varun Talwar, president Ambad Industries and Manufacturing Association, adding that the government should have foreseen the rise in demand for oxygen from hospitals and implemented measures such that both healthcare and industry did not suffer.

“Cutting of steel requires oxygen, so manufacturing of doors, bonnets for local automobile industries like Mahindra & Mahindra has been hit. The situation is so grim that production of beds for hospitals is affected, as there is no oxygen to cut steel. In the last 10 days, 40% steel units have shut down, and the rest will follow soon,” he warned.

Getting oxygen from Gujarat entails high risk, as it could be seized by government and offered to hospitals.

443,['27/09/2020'],Maharashtra is first in country to ban sale of loose cigarettes,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Maharashtra has become the first state in the country to ban the sale of “loose” cigarettes and beedis.

A notification issued by the state public health department on Thursday states that, in sync with sub section

(2) of section 7 of Cigarette and other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce Production, Supply & Distribution) Act, 2003, the state imposes a complete ban on sale of single stick loose cigarette and beedis. The notification is signed by principal secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas.

This has been done because loose cigarettes were sold without packet, which carry graphic health war nings meant to educate the public about the harms of smoking. Smoking has been linked to cancers and heart disease.

Tata Memorial Hospital’s cancer surgeon Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi said that the new order would help cut down the habit among the youth. “The tobacco epidemic in India is fuelled by youth who are 16 to 17 years of age. They buy loose cigarettes as they don’t have the financial resources to buy a full packet,” he said. Also, grown-ups who bought loose cigarettes never felt the pinch of higher taxes imposed on tobacco goods.

“Studies have shown that a 10% rise in taxes results in 8% drop in the number of smokers. But if people are allowed to buy a single cigarette, they don’t feel the effect of the higher taxes,” added Dr Chaturvedi. As per the Global Tobacco Youth Survey 2016, Maharashtra has the lowest smoking rate in the country.

VIJAYAWADA: With water stagnating in open spaces and posing the risk of turning into breeding grounds for mosquitoes, the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation ( VMC ) has developed an action plan to curb the mosquito menace and the spread of vector-borne diseases.

Despite repeated notices by the VMC, many owners of vacant plots have taken no action to fill the land. In some instances, locals have complained of poisonous snakes that appear on these lands in the monsoon.

The malaria wing of the VMC has issued notices to site owners and the civic body has also started to fill vacant plots with debris. Authorities of the sanitation and malaria department are advising site owners to clean their land and fill it with gravel to prevent inundation.

“We had earlier hesitated clearing our vacant land to avoid expenses. But the VMC came forward to provide an earthmover free of cost. We had to bear the fuel charges. This helped us clear our land within hours,” said K Rama Rao, owner of a flat in Madhuranagar.

Authorities of the civic body said the number of malaria and dengue cases have come down this year. “We are happy that the number of malaria cases came down. Vacant land cleaning and filling programme helped us overcome the mosquito problem. Around 45 dengue cases were registered in 2019 and 12 people died of dengue as per records while this year the number came down drastically. Not even a single dengue death has been registered this year,” said Dr Iqbal, a biologist at the VMC.

Fogging, anti-larval spraying and use of oil balls is being continued across the city, he added.

CHENNAI: The Chennai police on Friday registered a first information report (FIR) naming several executives of Franklin Templeton on a complaint by a group of investors that 28,000 crore of three lakh investors was stuck because the mutual fund abruptly closed down six debt schemes in April this year.

The FIR by the economic offences wing (EOW) names Santosh Das Kamath , managing director and chief investment officer of Franklin Templeton Asset Management India Pvt Ltd (FTAMIL), Sanjay V Sapre, its whole -time member, and Jayaram Subramaniam Iyer, Vivek Kudva, RV Subramaniam and Pradip P Shah, directors of FTAMIL and Franklin Templeton Trustee Services Pvt Ltd (FTTSPL).

The EOW registered the FIR after investigating a complaint filed by the Chennai Financial Markets & Accountability (CFMA), an investors' group, and a few others in May this year.

A Franklin Templeton spokesperson said, ""We have not seen a copy of the First Information Report (FIR) and are not in a position to comment on specific details"".

It said the CFMA has levelled baseless allegations. ""The press release issued by CFMA citing the FIR, is replete with various misleading and baseless allegations, besides being inappropriate, as the matter is currently sub-judice"", the spokesperson added.

After the six debt schemes were closed, a larger number of investors all over the country had dragged Franklin Templeton to court demanding refund of their investments, especially after Franklin Templeton claimed that two of the funds, Franklin India Low Duration Fund and Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, turned cash-positive on August 31.

Since then, the six schemes have received over Rs 6,486 crore, said the CFMA which is fighting for retirees who had parked their hard-earned savings in the various schemes of Franklin Templeton expecting a safe and better return on their investments as promised by the global fund house that manages over Rs 1.16 lakh crore in mutual funds in India and $700 billion globally.

The CFMA is also contemplating filing of Class Action Suit against Franklin Templeton global. According to CFMA, Franklin Templeton has a more than Rs 1,00,000 crores of assets under management with 30-40 lakh unit-holders.

On September 11, some investors filed an intervening application before the Karnataka High Court to direct FTAMIL to return money to those who invested in the schemes that hadurned cash-positive. An RTI query has already revealed that Franklin Templeton did not take any approval from the capital market regulator before winding up its six debt schemes.

The apex I-T authority said that hard disks, pen drives and handwritten diaries have been seized during the searches. “Certain handwritten diaries found indicate giving and taking of loans in cash and out of books receipt of cash on account of booking of commercial space in the real estate project,” the CBDT said, indicating huge circular transactions of black money.

The I-T authorities are tracking cash payments made to contractors and other fictitious payments booked. On Friday, the I-T officials searched around 20 residential and business premises of a “prominent group having operations in Jharkhand and West Bengal”. The CBDT said that the group has been engaged in the business of vanasapati ghee, real estate and tea estates.

The group is accused of running shell firms, most of which had family members as directors, no real business activity and very few returns of income filed. Most of the returns with ROC have also not been filed, the CBDT said.

Diaries and pen drives seized from over 20 premises in Jharkhand & Bengal revealed evidence of cash transactions of more than Rs 40cr.

455,['27/09/2020'],ED lens on CPM neta son’s property deals,"KOCHI: The Enforcement Directorate probing the money trail in the gold smuggling case has directed the state registration department to provide details of transactions of properties belonging to Bineesh Kodiyeri, son of Kerala CPM secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan .

The ED, which interrogated Bineesh for over 11 hours on September 9 in connection with the case, has sent a notice to the department, requesting it to send the certified copies of the sale deeds and encumbrance certificates of Bineesh’s properties available in its records.

Reacting to the ED notice to the revenue department, Balakrishnan said that he had earlier made it clear that he will not intervene in any probe and that his son has to face action if he had done something wrong.

In its notice dated September 11, the ED has said that all properties related to Bineesh were under its investigation and directed the registration department that any transaction on his immovable assets must not be done without prior information to the ED assistant director in Kochi.

The ED is probing whether the properties were part of the proceeds of the crime committed under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and other related offences.

While the NIA is probing the terror link of the gold smuggling in Kerala, other central agencies, including the Customs department and the ED, are carrying out separate investigations into the case.

Bineesh was summoned for questioning by the ED on September 9 after charges were levelled against him for his alleged links with some members of a drug racket busted by the Narcotics Control Bureau in Bengaluru recently.

456,['27/09/2020'],In Bengaluru 20% of cancer patients arriving at hospitals in late stages,"BENGALURU: Nearly 20 per cent of newly diagnosed cancer patients are reporting for follow-ups very late after entering advanced stages of the disease, say oncologists in Bengaluru. This is mainly because coronavirus fears or restrictions prevented them from travelling to the hospital. The transport problem was particularly severe during lockdowns.Delays in starting treatment or breaks can allow cancer cells to grow. This is a serious concern in the case of patients who live in another city and seek treatment in Bengaluru. More than 40 per cent of cancer patients at Bengaluru hospitals are from Bihar and other northern states and West Bengal.“Patients from other states and far-off districts in Karnataka could not seek treatment during the Covid-induced lockdown , when there was no public transport. In about 20 per cent of the patients we are seeing now, the cancer is already in advanced stages,” said Dr BS Ajai Kumar, founder and chairman of HCG Hospitals in Bengaluru.Doctors in Tumakuru told a 54-year-old man in June that he might be suffering from colon cancer. He was brought to HCG only a week ago after the cancer had spread to other organs, including liver. His condition is severe.According to Dr Vikram Kekatpure, a senior consultant for head and neck surgical oncology at Cytecare Cancer Hospitals , many patients from West Bengal and northeast states prefer to get treated in Bengaluru, where the quality of care is better. But they are still not travelling because of Covid-19 concerns.“During the early days of lockdown, surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation treatment for existing and new patients were cancelled or postponed as treatment protocols in the context of Covid were not known and there was a fear factor. Patients and staff were unable to reach hospitals. Now, with Covid cases occurring in their own families, cancer patients are facing difficulties in getting treatment and family support,” Dr Kekatpure said.Dr Kekatpure also said that more than 20 per cent of patients reporting for follow-ups after the initial diagnosis had entered advanced stages. “The true number is likely to be much higher than 20 per cent as the pandemic is still evolving. The effect will last much after it ends,” he added.Apart from transport woes, people are also likely to delay treatment because of financial problems such as a job loss or pay cut. The delays lead to disease progression and poor outcomes.Cost goes up, quality of life worsensWhen cancer progresses, patients need multiple treatment modalities, according to Dr Bhaskar Vishwanathan, professor of radiation oncology at the Vydehi Institute of Medical Science and Research Centre. “Time is crucial in cancer treatment. “Patients who would have earlier needed a single modality of treatment — surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy — may now have to undergo all three and this can only add to the treatment cost. People who were in middle stages would have migrated to advanced stages. It will have a bearing on the quality of life of the patients,” he explained. But the footfall at hospitals is slowly picking up now, he added.The government-run Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology did not stop treatment for even a single day during the lockdown and is now getting patients from various parts of the country. “Patients from other states generally report to the hospital after the cancer has already spread. After the pandemic, nearly 15 per cent of the patients delayed the decision of travelling to Bengaluru. But they are now coming in as some train services have been restarted,” said Dr Prabha Seshachar, a resident medical officer at Kidwai.She added that several patients who were admitted in March stayed in Kidwai till the lockdown was lifted.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/20-of-cancer-patients-arriving-at-hospitals-in-late-stages/articleshow/78342425.cms

461,['27/09/2020'],"Sorry mayor, not in mood for janata curfew","Nagpur: People on the roads, streets abuzz with vehicles and marketplaces crowded. It was like any other day in the life of Nagpurians. The ‘janata’ of Nagpur again chose to ignore mayor Sandip Joshi’s call for voluntary curfew for the second consecutive weekend, on Saturday.

Joshi had appealed to the people on September 24 to observe a self-imposed janata curfew on Saturday and Sunday to contain Covid-19 spread. The number of positive cases and fatalities were increasing in city.

TOI found that people went about their routines and it was business as usual in the commercial areas. Last weekend too no heed was paid to Joshi’s curfew call.

As there was no official enforcement of the curfew, traffic congestion was seen on many roads and outside shopping areas. Many claimed that they were aware of the curfew appeal by the mayor but were forced to travel to earn their livelihood.

At Central Avenue, normal traffic was seen while at Itwari and Mahal all shops were open, which drew in huge crowds. Most of the private offices remained open and so were roadside vendors.

Even in BJP-dominated areas like Mahal, Narendra Nagar and Sakkardara, Joshi’s call evoked poor response. South-West Nagpur — leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis’s constituency — too had all shops functioning.

The situation was no different in Kalamna and Cotton markets. Both the city’s wholesale vegetable markets were abuzz with activities since early Saturday morning.

The traders, who had opened shops, claimed that they following Covid-19 guidelines and had incurred losses during three months of complete lockdown.

Despite repeated attempts, Joshi was not available for comments. Supporting the mayor’s call for a janata curfew, Congress corporator Sandip Sahare said, “It is a good concept to break the Covid chain. Administration should enforce the lockdown strictly.”

As per new regulations, any lockdown outside containment areas in any city can be enforced only after taking permission from the Centre.

462,['27/09/2020'],Neeri bags award for tech to treat flowing waste water,"Nagpur: City’s National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) has bagged the National Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Technology award 2020 for its first-of-its-kind technology of treating flowing waste water.

In April 2018, TOI was the first to report about the Restoration of Nullahs and Ecological Units (RENEU) technology, a pilot experiment which was done in the city at Neeri headquarters. Since last year, the technology is cleaning around six drains which are close to the ‘sangam’ point at the site of Kumbh mela and eventually meet Ganga river in Prayagraj.

“The six drains lead to one bigger channel which flows straight down to the sangam point. Since we have implemented the technology there, the water quality has improved tremendously. Almost all the parameters meet the norms prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB),” said Atya Kapley, senior principal scientist and head of Director’s Research Cell at Neeri.

Highlighting that the technology aims at tackling lack of sewage management in the country, the scientist added, “Majority of the cities across India do not have proper sewage network. Hardly 30% of the sewage water reached the treatment plant, rest all gets discharged directly into water bodies. RENEU technology works like a mobile sewage treatment plant (STP).”

A team of scientists including Kapley, Ritesh Vijay, Hemant Bherwani, Rita Dhodapkar and Tuhin Banerjee developed the technology under the leadership of Neeri director Rakesh Kumar.

According to Vijay, who is the senior principal scientist and head of Neeri’s Centre for Strategic Urban Management, the technology is being implemented in various cities including Mumbai, Daman, Ulhasnagar and Pune. The institute also plans to implement it at 10 drains in Gorakhpur. “RENEU is planned to get implemented in 100 more drains across the country in over five states including but not limited to UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Delhi,” stated a press release issued by Neeri.

As per scientists, the technology involves five major steps for cleaning. “All natural components like phyto-traps, solar diffused aeration, light-weighted building material and wetland plants to clean the nullah are used. No chemicals are required in this treatment,” added Vijay.

Highlighting more about the technology, the release added, “RENEU is different from the conventional STPs as it treats the flowing waste water in the drain itself. Besides, the technology is economical too and consumes far less time for construction and operation. It eliminates the need for the construction of piping and pumping networks for taking the sewage to STPs.”

Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary (public health), issued a notification on September 24. “In pursuance of sub section (2) of section (7) of the Cigarette and other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003, the government of Maharashtra hereby imposes complete ban on the sale of single stick loose cigarette and bidi, being sold without packet as they do not have specific health warning on it in public interest, with immediate effect in the state of Maharashtra.”

The power to enforce this rule is with officer of rank of not below police sub-inspector, state food and drugs administration or any equivalent officer authorized by central or state government.

Those violating the rule will be punishable with imprisonment which may extend up to one year or with fine, which may extend up to Rs1,000. For second or subsequent conviction, the imprisonment may extend up to two years or the fine will be up to Rs3,000.

Nilesh Bharne, joint commissioner of police, said that the city police was yet to receive the order. “We will need to peruse the order and contemplate on the legal aspect of it,” he told TOI.

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B also said that Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) was yet to receive the order. “However, we will implement it as soon as we get it officially,” he added.

Even though NMC has not permitted pan kiosks to open, many are doing business masquerading as general provisions stores. The owners hang packets of chips and keep bottles of aerated drinks on the counter. Tea stall owners surreptitiously too sell loose cigarettes and bidis.

The pan kiosk owners are unhappy with this order. “Most of my customers buy loose cigarettes. Very few buy packets. Besides, there is more margin in selling loose cigarettes. My business will be badly hit,” said an owner in Chhatrapati Nagar.

464,['27/09/2020'],Kids add kilos as pandemic curtails outdoor activity,"Bengaluru: Many children are quickly putting on weight because of oversnacking, especially between online classes, lack of outdoor physical activity and erratic routines, say paediatricians.A seven-year-old boy, who should normally weigh 26-28kg, weighed 40kg when Bengaluru-based paediatric pulmonologist Dr Bharat Reddy examined him recently.But many parents have not yet noticed the health changes triggered by prolonged closure of schools, where kids are most active, and curtailment of outdoor games.Paediatrician Dr SM Prasad said children imitated parents. “Physical activities have reduced for parents, so children also don’t feel motivated. The whole family must follow a timetable, the way everyone did before the pandemic erupted. Currently, children are sleeping late as they wait for their parents to finish their work. Naturally, they wake up late. The diurnal rhythm, which plays a role in sleep cycle and metabolism, is disrupted,” Dr Prasad said.Parents, he added, must avoid fast food and fried snacks, which are among the most delivered items.According to Dr Reddy, children will require 10 to 12 months to shed the extra kilos if they start 30 minutes of daily exercise, yoga and skipping now. Many asthmatic children have also developed weight problems. “There is higher consumption of food and there is no fixed schedule. I suggest parents fix a regular time for everything, like they did during school days,” he said.Dr Prasad said parents should take children to play areas in apartment complexes or parks with all necessary precautions. “Many families say that they won’t come out till there is a vaccine for SARS- CoV2 [formal name of the virus that causes Covid-19]. At this point, it is not clear when a vaccine would be ready. One should take precautions and pursue some form of a normal routine,” he said.Weight and ICU complicationsA six-year-old boy suffering from rickettsial fever, a tick-borne infection, was recently treated in the intensive care unit of Columbia Asia hospital near Yeshwantpur. The boy’s weight gain over the past six months complicated the treatment. He weighed 30kg, which is high for his age.“Obesity adversely affects the outcome of children in the ICU. Fluid management becomes very challenging, especially when children are critically ill. This affects the outcome. The six-year-old boy had to stay in longer. The parents mentioned that he put on weight after March,” said Dr Supraja Chandrashekar, paediatric intensivist, Columbia Asia.

NVP Vidyasagar, assistant general manager of MahaMetro, said that the girder was launched by asking a block of four hours from Central Railway (CR). “It is the longest block in the area except for that taken for the Khapri ROB,” he added.

The Manish Nagar ROB required a girder of 64.38 metre. “Of this we had launched girder of total 19m length on both sides of the railway track beforehand. On Saturday we launched the bow string girder of 43.48m length and 12.6m width. The operation was accomplished in 2.30 hours,” said Vidyasagar.

The girder was fabricated in Pune and brought to Nagpur in a huge trailer by road. The fabrication work had begun in March this year. The weight of the girder is 360 tons and is of E-350 grade. It has been prepared as per specifications of Research Design and Standards Organization (RDSO), a ministry of railways undertaking.

Vidyasagar further said that around 500 ton steel was used to support the 350 ton girder.

He admitted that the work on the project had been delayed and attributed it to Covid lockdown and labour shortage. “From mid-March to May beginning work had completely stopped. The work of fixing the girders is done by expert welders. Most of the welders had gone back to their native villages during the lockdown. We had to find local welders. Work of many welders was not found satisfactory while recruiting them and they were rejected. It was with great difficulty that we found the necessary workforce,” said the official.

CHENNAI: There is no representative from Tamil Nadu in BJP’s new team of national office-bearers, announced by the party national president J P Nadda on Saturday.

H Raja, who was a national secretary of the party since 2014, has been removed as no party functionary can continue in a post for more than six years. National general secretary Muralidhar Rao , who was in charge of Tamil Nadu for about 12 years as previous party president Amit Shah did not go for a major reshuffle of office bearers during his tenure, has been moved out too.

Tamil Nadu BJP leaders were expecting promotion of some leaders from the state to the national level. Nadda’s decision to ignore TN leaders is an indication of the party leadership’s displeasure over the local leaders’ inability to make a political dent in the state, which is dominated by the two Dravidian majors, the AIADMK and the DMK. The omission of TN BJP leaders may become yet another weapon for the opposition parties to lash out at the BJP and brand it as a north Indian party, especially when state elections are less than seven months away.

Senior state leaders are a worried lot, said a functionary in state BJP. This was the first time in the last two decades that the state went without any representation in the BJP’s national leadership. Stalwarts like K Jana Krishnamurthi and K N Govindacharya had served as party national president and general secretary respectively in the past.

The only hope for local leaders now is to find a place in the 120-strong party national executive when it is rejigged. Sources said it's expected soon. “Today’s reshuffle of national office bearers has dented the morale of the party functionaries and cadres here,” said a senior leader.

Political analyst Kolahala Srenivaas said ignoring TN leaders has proven that the saffron party’s national leadership was least interested in Tamil Nadu. Modi had earlier ignored Tamil Nadu while forming the cabinet, he said. Nirmala Sitharaman, who hails from Trichy, is considered an outsider as she does not live in Tamil Nadu. “It is a clear indication that they are not happy with the state leaders of the BJP. They also understand that TN is not a fertile ground for the party to grow,” he said.

Garima Jat , 21, had come from Jhunjhunu to appear for her final year BSc exam when the accused, a native of Dholpur and nephew of a former sarpanch, shot her. The accused was identified as Vishnu Choudhary (23) and they knew each other. Vishnu was arrested.

DCP-Jaipur East, Rahul Jain told TOI, “At around 10:15 am on Saturday, the accused reached the victim’s college and first stabbed her in the neck following which he shot her near the navel. One bullet lodged in her stomach. Although she was rushed to a hospital, she died while undergoing treatment.” Vishnu tried to escape but was chased by a policeman who followed him by hitching rides in civilian vehicles and finally catching him. Cops recovered the country-made pistol and the knife used by Vishnu. “The motive behind the murder remains unknown.

The two were known to each other. They met at a coaching centre in Jaipur where they were preparing for the Rajasthan Administrative Service examination,” the DCP said. Sources alleged that the two were probably in a relationship “which had worsened” in recent times. However, neither the families nor the officials confirmed this. The victim’s postmortem was done on Saturday night. The accused will be produced in court on Sunday.

469,['27/09/2020'],No stay on govt charges for Covid patients in pvt hosps: HC,"Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Saturday clarified that it hadn’t stayed rates prescribed for Covid-19 patients in private hospitals mentioned in ‘Clause 4’ of Maharashtra government’s May 21 notification.

On Thursday, the HC stayed ‘Clause 4’ after the government failed to reply about its competency on fixing charges for non-Covid patients in private hospitals. However, the same clause also mentioned charges for Covid patients.

The government moved an urgent civil application praying for clarification of court’s order. The petitioners and respondents in case too granted their no objection for allowing government’s demand.

“Due to inadvertence, we stayed the entire Clause No (4) of the May 21 notification. However, what we intended is to stay rates prescribed as per Annexure A and B for non-Covid patients. The September 25 order shall accordingly be construed. By way of caution, we make it clear that we’ve not stayed rates prescribed for Covid-19 patients in the notification,” a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Pushpa Ganediwala clarified.

Before disposing of the government’s application, the judges made it clear that relief which they had granted is restricted to hospitals within jurisdiction of Nagpur Bench comprising entire Vidarbha region.

Dr Pradeep Arora, a paediatrician who runs a nursing home, and Vidarbha Hospital Association had moved the judiciary challenging May 21 notification that fixed rates for treating Covid-19 and non-Covid patients in private hospitals, nursing homes and clinics across the state. All these establishments are warned against charging over the fixed rates.

The trial for the Covishield vaccine, developed by Oxford University along with pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca, will involve 200 volunteers in Mumbai. While KEM will carry out the trial for 100 volunteers, the civic-run Nair Hospital near Mumbai Central station is expected to start its 100-volunteer trial on Monday. It is reliably learnt that three women are among 10 volunteeers so far selected for the trial at Nair Hospital.BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani told TOI the identity of the volunteers couldn’t be revealed in accordance with the ethics committee’s rules for the trial.“Volunteers are screened as per the rules of the trial. Volunteers who have not had any exposure to the Covid-19-causing virus will be selected,” he added. Every volunteer will have to undergo an RT-PCR test as well as an antibody test to be doubly sure that he or she hasn’t been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19.Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital, said his hospital was earlier supposed to include 160 volunteers for the trial. “But the number of trial centres were increased and the number of volunteers per centre was reduced to 100,” he said.In all, 1,600 volunteers will participate in the Phase-III trials of the Oxford vaccine.Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of Nair Hospital, said screening of volunteers is underway. “We will start vaccinating on Monday,” he added. The trial is a randomized one, with 20%-25% volunteers likely to get a placebo instead of the vaccine. The Mumbai leg is likely to be completed within a month.The Indian part of the trial is being carried out by Pune-based Serum Institute of India, which will manufacture the vaccine if it is successful.Hospitals in Pune, Nagpur, Chandigarh and Visakhapatnam, among others, are part of the trial.The Covishield will be administered as two doses scheduled on Day 1 and 29 as 0.5ml dose intramuscularly. Earlier this month, AstraZeneca halted the clinical trials of Covishield after one of the volunteers developed an adverse reaction. They were restarted within a few days after it was established the volunteer had a neurological condition.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78342448,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-336597,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-19-oxfords-vaccine-trial-kicks-off-at-kem-nair-hospital-may-start-it-tomorrow/articleshow/78342451.cms
471,['27/09/2020'],Chennai: Metro stations to get e-autos soon,"A CMRL official said an app-based e-auto service was planned on the lines of those recently launched. The e-au... Read More

CHENNAI: Solar or electric-powered autorickshaws could soon operate from metro stations to provide commuters with a greener alternative for last-mile connectivity. The service will be in addition to Chennai Metro Rail Limited 's existing eco-friendly transport fleet that includes recently launched e-bikes at four stations.

A CMRL official said an app-based e-auto service was planned on the lines of those recently launched. The e-auto has many safety features for passengers and is mostly driven by women. ""Our proposal to introduce the service is still under progress and discussion is underway,"" an official said.

Last week, the chief minister flagged off 13 types of solar and electric autos to be operated by women. The autos are equipped with GPS, CCTV cameras, panic button and tabs and can be used for various purposes.

Apart from regular shareautos and cabs which operate up to a specific distance from stations, CMRL operates app-based e-bikes in collaboration with two different startups across eight stations. The service involves pick-up and drop-off hubs in and outside stations enabling commuters to book bikes through an app.

E-auto services, introduced at Alandur station in January 2019, were to be extended to other stations based on commuter response, but were soon discontinued.

While metro train services were introduced to reduce the number of cars and bikes on the road and cut emissions, every metro train has the capacity to generate its own energy that on an average can save about 30% of energy drawn from the grid. The trains run on a regenerative braking system where a three-phase traction motor installed on trains acts as a generator to produce electricity whenever the brake is applied. The power generated goes into the overhead electricity lines (OHE) lines.

A four-car metro train, which runs approximately for about 400km a day, generates around 1900kWh through the traction system. This electricity is mostly consumed by the rolling stocks (trains) on the same electrical section and the remaining is fed back to CMRL's 33kv network. Generating its own power reduces dependency on Tangedco, which in turn can save its power generation and eventually carbon emissions.

In addition, CMRL has solar panels of more than 5.5MW capacity installed at the stations to power lights. It also has plans to commission a 8MW solar power plant to generate more than 1.16 crore units of electricity for train and station operations and save up to 2.54 crore every year towards the purchase of electricity and also help cut down carbon emissions of up to 11,587 tonnes a year.

The victim, Govinda Madavi (65), was at the outskirts of his farm when the tiger killed him in forest compartment no. 169 in Virur range.

There was brief tension in the area as villagers were irked following repeated attacks by the tiger. RFO Gajanan Ingle pacified the villagers and took the body for postmortem. They have given ex-gratia aid to kin of the deceased.

Though officials said they are yet to ascertain the identity of the tiger, they are confident that was the same killer tiger.

The forest department had issued capturing orders against the trouble tiger in January, but the teams have failed to capture the beast so far. DCF (Central Chandrapur division) Arvind Mundhe said, “We are continuously tracking and baiting it. There have been many close calls, but every time the animal managed to give a slip to the capturing team.”

He said the tiger avoids eating its prey immediately and comes back to the kill later in the night.

This is the 23rd human kill in the district so far this year. A total of 20 people have been killed in tiger attacks, while three others by leopards.

474,['27/09/2020'],Use of mobile phones permitted only for navigation while driving vehicles,"NEW DELHI: Drivers can use hand held devices (mobile phones) only for navigation while driving vehicles , the road transport ministry notified on Friday. Paving the way for smoother verification of documents and recording of violations electronically, the ministry also allowed use of digital documents such as driving licence, permits, registration, insurance and fitness certificates.

These rules will come into effect from October 1.

Specifying the use of hand held device or mobile phone while driving, the ministry notification said this will be allowed provided “such use is solely for route navigation by fixing the device on the dashboard of the vehicle in such a manner that shall not disturb the concentration of the driver while driving.” TOI on February 1 had first reported the government move to allow the use of mobile phone only for navigation.

Global studies suggest that drivers using mobile phones while driving are approximately four times more likely to be involved in a crash with texting during driving considered especially perilous. The use of mobile phones while driving has been brought under dangerous driving category in the amended Motor Vehicle Act and attracts a fine of up to Rs 5,000 or up to one year jail or both.

On the changes made related to IT services and electronic monitoring for enforcement, the ministry said it would “ensure better enforcement of traffic rules and will remove harassment of drivers and citizens.” The provisions specify that the details of driving licences disqualified or revoked by the licensing authority have to be recorded and updated chronologically in the web portal for better monitoring of driver behaviour. It also said documents found validated through electronic means shall not be demanded in physical forms for inspection.

The amended rules, which will come to effect from next Thursday, also specify that the driver or conductor can produce DL, RC, insurance, fitness and permit and PUC certificates and any other relevant documents in physical or electronic form. It says after validation of the documents in electronic form, if the information in documents are found to be valid and in force, then “physical forms of such documents shall not be demanded for inspection, including in cases where there is an offence made out necessitating seizure of any such documents.”

The inspecting officer will also have to put stamp of inspection and his identity, which will be recorded in the portal. “This would help in unnecessary re-checking or inspection of vehicles and further would remove harassment to the drivers,” the ministry said.

An official said there is a need to have digital records of all actions, which will check corruption as well.

The ministry has also said that the states would be allowed to multiply the penalties for offences up to 10 times on certain conditions.

AHMEDABAD: For Sangeeta (not her real name) it was heartbreak twice over, which pushed her into depression. The 45-year-old underwent the IVF treatment on her husband’s insistence. She gave birth to twins with the procedure. Later, she was accused of having an affair with the sperm donor , left her husband with her sons, and fell in love with the donor, 10 years her junior.

But the donor abandoned her allegedly after taking custody of her two sons. The woman is currently sheltered at Sakhi One Stop Centre run by the state government.

According to Abhayam 181 helpline officials, Sangeeta had called earlier this week seeking shelter. “She mentioned that she had fallen in love with a resident of Vastral and had married him,” a counsellsor said. “After four years of marriage, the duo decided to seek the IVF procedure after they realized that natural pregnancy was not possible.”

During this time, the couple met the man who agreed to donate sperm for the procedure. The insemination was successful and the couple got twin sons.

The family lived happily for the next five years. Afterwards, her husband fell into hard times and took to drinking. In the frequent squabbles, the issue of the sons not being his used to crop up. Sangeeta tried to tell him that IVF had been his idea and stressed that she had no contact with the donor.

But as the relationship deteriorated, Sangeeta started living separately with her sons. She could not go to her parents as they were not on talking terms with her since her marriage against their wish.

Sought help from Abhayam

She started working as domestic help and earned more than Rs 15,000 a month, which was enough to sustain them,” said the counsellor. “During this time, she ran into the donor, who was running a coaching class for secondary and higher secondary students. The donor was aware of the problems between the couple and felt bad about his unwitting role.”

The counsellor said that Sangeeta and the donor became friends and eventually a relationship developed. He even partially shouldered the responsibility of the kids.

Through him, Sangeeta again became pregnant about five months ago. But when she broached the topic of marriage, the donor refused to tie the knot. When it got difficult for Sangeeta to get work after the lockdown, the donor took the kids, calling them ‘his own’. He refused to allow Sangeeta to stay with him.

“She had already run out of resources and due to the lack of work, she stayed afloat for a few months on her savings,” the counsellor said. “But from July, it was difficult for her to get back to normal. After repeated notices from her landlord, she had to leave her home. As she was pregnant, she called Abhayam 181 to seek help.”

The labourers were residents of Katni and were bound for Neemuch — about 700km away — for contractual labour work, said tehsildar Yogesh Meshram. About 540km from their hometown, and apparently driving all night, their vehicle crashed into an oncoming truck in Datana Matana area at 4am, ASI Parmanand Singh said. Four labourers died on the spot, and the fifth succumbed in a hospital, he added.

Locals helped cops cut away the mangled wreckage and rescue the victims. The eight injured will need multiple surgeries, said Dr Vikram Raghuvanshi of Ujjain district hospital. Police named the dead as Somchand, Vimal Kumar , Rajesh Vishwakarma , Gagan Vishwakarma and Sinku Singh . Police are looking for the driver and cleaner of the Rajasthan-registered truck.

The role of vitamin D has come to the fore due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as experts point to the vitamin’s protective and curative roles.Dr Ritu Rana, assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar (IIPH-G), said the vitamin is important for regulation of calcium and phosphate in the body and also the regulation of the immune system.“Studies before Covid-19 have shown the positive impact of vitamin D in respiratory tract infections, its intake reduces the severity and can also help in treatment,” she said, adding that a limited study in Spain on Covid-19 patients has shown a positive impact of the vitamin even as the body of evidence globally is still emerging.Experts said the intake of fortified food, ranging from milk to oil, can help supplement the daily requirement.Dr Minesh Mehta, a citybased critical care specialist, said the observation of Covid-19 patients in the city has shown greater severity if there is a deficiency of vitamins and minerals including vitamin D.“Supplements are an integral part of treatment. Vitamin D also can play a preventive role,” he said.The diet at Covid-19 hospitals also emphasizes balanced nutrition that is rich in vitamins D and C and zinc. Binal Jethva, a dietician at the 1,200-bed Covid-19 facility at Civil Hospital, said vitamin D and C deficiency is very common among Covid-19 patients under treatment. “Those getting discharged are also advised to take supplements and improve their intake of vitamins and minerals,” she said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-78342514,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-61293,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vitamin-d-helps-prevent-respiratory-infections/articleshow/78342472.cms
483,['27/09/2020'],Villagers parade couple semi-clad in Dumka,"Dumka: A young couple , who were allegedly found in a compromising position, were stripped and paraded semi-clad in Shivapahad village under Ranga police station of Sahebganj district on Thursday night. Police rescued the couple on Friday evening and a search is on to identify the villagers involved in the crime.

Sources said the couple in their twenties belonging to different religious communities were reportedly caught red-handed by a group of villagers at an abandoned place. The villagers then hold them captive for about 16 hours before garlanding them shoes and slippers. The villagers later paraded them in the village.

The local khap-like panchayat had imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh on the boy but as he could not pay, the villagers decided to take the matter into their own hands by thrashing and humiliating them, the sources added. It was only after the video footage of the parading went viral on social media that a police team led by Barharwa sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Pramod Kumar Mishra rushed to the village on Friday evening to rescue the couple.

Mishra said, “The villagers initially refused to hand over the couple to us, but we rescued them after additional forces were called in from the district headquarters and the adjoining police stations.” An FIR for humiliation, thrashing and taking hostage of the couple was filed with the Ranga police station on Saturday, he said.

“We are identifying those involved in the crime and will take stringent legal action against them,” the SDPO said, adding that no arrest has been made so far.

484,['27/09/2020'],Biomedical waste raises hackles at Rims hostel,"Ranchi: Over 200 junior doctors and interns residing at the new PG Girls Hostel of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences ( Rims ) are living under the constant threat of contracting infection from the biomedical waste dumped right next to their hostel campus. The biomedical waste is being dumped near the boundary wall of the hostel because of the location’s proximity to the incinerator.

A few junior doctors had raised the issue with their seniors and shared videos of the site to highlight the conditions.

On Friday, too, the road leading to the incinerator was full of garbage and a foul smell was emanating from the area. “At a time when we are fighting the pandemic, we need to protect ourselves from any kind of infection. The heaps of untreated biomedical waste near the hostel campus significantly increase the chances of getting infected. But that is not all. The canteen and the hostel kitchen are located close to the boundary wall near the incinerator,” a junior doctor said on the condition of anonymity.

The Preventive and Social Medicine (PSM) department of Rims, which evaluates the performance of the agency tasked with handling the biomedical waste and running the incinerator, said it has received complaints. “We only submit reports to the hospital administration based on the performance of the agency,” Dr Vidyasagar , the in-charge of PSM department , said. Vidyasagar, however, added that the capacity of the current incinerator isn’t enough to handle the amount of biomedical waste generated by the hospital.

When asked about the biomedical waste, medical superintendent in-charge Dr D K Sinha said: “We have summoned the persons responsible for running the incinerator and those in-charge of handling the biomedical waste. We will make sure that no one gets infected due to the waste.”

486,['27/09/2020'],"Mukul is BJP nat’l vice-prez, Rahul loses out to Anupam","Kolkata: BJP leader Mukul Roy has got a plum all-India organizational post after waiting for nearly three years. Party national president JP Nadda, in an organizational reshuffle on Saturday, elevated Roy to the post of all-India vice president from an ordinary national executive member.

The move, ahead of the 2021 Bengal assembly polls, came amid speculation till July that the master strategist was in talks with Trinamool and complained that he was not being utilized in BJP that he joined in November 2017.

Social educator from Visva-Bharati and former MP Anupam Hazra, who fought on a BJP ticket from Jadavpur in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, was Saturday’s surprise inclusion in BJP hierarchy. Hazra has been inducted as one of the national secretaries from Bengal, replacing former BJP state president Rahul Sinha. Darjeeling MP Raju Bisht has got the post of national spokesperson.

Sinha, who didn’t find a place in Nadda’s new team or in Dilip Ghosh’s team, was quick to react. “I have been serving the party for the last 40 years. In reward, I had to make way for a leader coming from Trinamool. I will wait for 12 to 15 days and announce my future course,” he said.

Thanking Union home minister Amit Shah and Nadda, an upbeat Roy said: “I have been given a huge responsibility and will try to live up to expectations. We have elections in Bihar, West Bengal and Assam and I am sure BJP will come up with flying colours.”

Roy’s elevation to the post, the second after Vishnu Kant Shastri, will put to rest rumour mills guessing his “return” to TMC after the leader didn’t attend BJP’s July meeting in Delhi on Bengal polls. Shah, during his first Bengal virtual rally, kept Roy on the dais during his address. According to BJP insiders, Roy’s recognition will help ease out inhibitions of leaders in other parties who’re in two minds over taking the plunge.

Hazra’s inclusion has come as a surprise to many in BJP circles after he replaced Sinha.

Sinha was in Delhi along with Dilip Ghosh, Roy and others during the primary consultations with Nadda over the roadmap for Bengal BJP ahead of polls. “Bengal is Syama Prasad Mookerjee’s place. We will dislodge the government that has been terrorizing people. Corruption has become chronic in the state. Trinamool workers didn’t even spare the Amphan victims. Our workers are being killed, and framed in false cases. The biggest challenge is to give legal protection to our workers,” Hazra said.

BJP pointsman in the Hills Bisht held that he would work with equal dedication for the party and the people of Darjeeling.

487,['27/09/2020'],Abhishek’s online meet with MLAs today on farm bill stir,"Kolkata: Trinamool Congress second-in-command and Diamond Harbour MP Abhishek Banerjee has convened a virtual meeting of party MLAs on Sunday to set the tone for and tenor of “anti-farmer” bill protests ahead of the 2021 assembly polls.

All eyes are on Abhishek’s first such meeting, especially when some have reservations in accepting him as the leader after Mamata Banerjee. In addition, a senior minister from Kolkata has also sounded a discordant note against Kolkata Municipal Corporation administrator Firhad Hakim.

The MP had held a similar meeting, albeit with Trinamool Youth Congress members, in June and on a day Union home minister Amit Shah held his first virtual Bengal rally. According to TMC insiders, a follow-up meeting is likely after Kali Puja.

The online deliberation comes at a time the TMC has announced new committees in many districts, and replaced district and block presidents in some. There is apprehension that some MLAs are “at unease” over working with the new dispensation. Some of them even fear they may be denied tickets in the coming elections.

In contrast, many MLAs are also hoping to gauge the mood of party bosses at Sunday’s meeting. More so as the MLAs are under watch of Prashant Kishor’s I-PAC team and reports on internal feuds are reaching the Trinamool chief through her own network.

The assembly seats in Jangalmahal — West Midnapore, Jhargram, Bankura and Purulia — are very much in focus as Mamata wants to win back people who went with the BJP in 2019. The party has tried the same with PCPA-turned-Trinamool leader Chhatradhar Mahato, who has come under the NIA scanner.

Abhishek is likely to take stock of ongoing projects in the area and give MLAs more tasks for the road ahead. However, things are looking up in West Midnapore, where many BJP workers joined Trinamool, the latest defections taking place in Kharagpur on Saturday. The joining of Tushar Bhattacharya in Bankura is yet another positive development for TMC.

The MP may also want inputs from party bastions of Arambagh, Khanakul and Goghat in Hooghly, where the BJP has made inroads.

The Haldia Town Trinamool Youth Congress on Saturday lodged a police complaint against “unknown persons” for taking off Mamata and Abhishek banners at Kadamtala, and those in front of the municipality.

488,['27/09/2020'],"Cinema, jatra, music shows to start in state from Oct 1: Govt","Kolkata: Cinemas , plays, jatras , musical and dance recitals as well as magic shows will resume from October 1 after a six-month break, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said in a tweet on Saturday evening.

“To return to normalcy, “jatras, plays, OATs, cinemas and all musical, dance, recital & magic shows shall be allowed to function with 50 participants or less from 1 Oct subject to adherence to physical distancing norms, wearing of masks and compliance to precautionary protocols,” she posted. The announcement was greeted with joy by the film and entertainment industry.

Actor Prosenjit Chatterjee said he was happy with the news of the reopening. “Work has already begun for television and OTT. So many technicians are involved with the entertainment industry. I am very happy for them,” he said.

At present, Bengal has 200 single screens and 60 multiplexes. According to Ratan Saha, chairman of the exhibitor section of Eastern India Mot-ion Pictures Association (EIMPA), “This decision is good for our industry. Even if 50 people are allowed, it is a beginning.” While Saha sought clarity on whether a central government notification was required, Chatterjee felt the chief minister must have already discussed it with relevant authorities before she tweeted on the subject.

With cinemas shut for six months, most releases have been on OTT. Exhibitors feel that there could be difficulty initially in sourcing content. “Those who decide to reopen will have to check if the theatres are in working condition. There is also the issue of getting good content immediately,” Saha added.

Incidentally, singer Lopamudra Mitra had just a day before requested the chief minister to allow programs since livelihood of musicians and technicians, managers and support groups were at stake. “Allowing programs to begin with 50 people is a good start. We will follow all the norms that are set for us,” she said.

Jatra groups are also relieved at the prospect of shows resuming soon. At present there are some 60 professional jatra groups operating in Chitpur. Piya Sengupta, who is also the president of EIMPA and a jatra actress, said, “Jatras and machas involve livelihood of more than lakhs of people. There is finally some light at the end of the tunnel for them.”

Around 15 people, including businessmen, students and Santiniketan and Bolpur residents, attended the 2-hour meet at the university central office.

After the meeting, Bolpur resident and APDR official Sailen Mishra said: “We oppose the wall’s construction and any kind of boundary around the fairground. We were told that the fairground would be demarcated by low walls and a fence. We find no justification to fence the ground. It should stay open.”

“We found that the university authorities and committee members had already resolved to set up the fence around the fairground. We opposed it and left the meeting,” a trader said.

Despite classes being suspended due to the pandemic, some students arrived at the VB office. Two of them were invited in to present their views, and sought that the gate that had been demolished be reconstructed.

Local resident Subir Banerjee said discussions were held in a very cordial manner. “As an individual, I want some temporary fencing. They listened patiently and said the work would be done aesthetically. A field visit will be undertaken,” he said.

Vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty, Birbhum district magistrate Moumita Godara and police superintendent Shyam Singh were present at the meeting.

492,['27/09/2020'],Mamata to Dhankhar: Guv can’t function as pol party rep,"Kolkata: In a letter to governor Jagdeep Dhankhar , Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has said it is “distressing” that the governor is acting in the “worst traditions of constitutional democracy as an agent of the ruling central government political party” and pointed out that such an “agency in the state government” was never imagined by the framers of the Constitution. As head of state, the governor cannot be a “representative of a political party in any manner,” she said.

The nine-page letter sent on Saturday is the latest in the escalating war of words between Nabanna and Raj Bhavan and comes on the heels of a letter that the governor sent to state DGP Virendra on September 20 seeking information on the ongoing investigations against BJP MP Arjun Singh.

The CM said she was “upset, anguished and disillusioned” on reading the governor’s letter and Twitter posts. “Your aspersions sadly consist of uncorroborated judgments and insinuations against the state police and the state government,” Banerjee wrote and dubbed Dhankhar’s action as “excessive and blatant attempts at usurpation of constitutional mandates” and “unwarranted excesses” on his part.

The CM pointed out that the governor’s inquiry into criminal investigations against Arjun Singh and seeking reports on the investigation processes from the DGP was not the same as seeking information regarding an executive or legislative proposal and “such enquiry not only amounts to interference in the day-to-day administration of the state government but also gives rise to serious suspicions of interference and influencing of on-going investigations”.

Stating that this would set a dangerous precedent, the CM wrote, “… the accused, by successfully obtaining Hon’ble governor’s extra-legal intervention and interference, has actually put the Hon’ble governor in a dangerously precarious position which might have serious consequences under law”. She added, “This may also give rise to a wrong impression in the minds of persons accused in various cases that Hon’ble governor instead of the Hon’ble judiciary, is now the appropriate authority in the state to approach and seek redressal of grievances, if any, in an ongoing investigation process.”

The CM further wrote: “It is disastrous that you defamed the DGP upon his non-compliance with your unlawful and unwarranted demands and are now attempting to intimidate and arm-twist him into capitulating to your unconstitutional requests.... It is beyond my imagination as to why the said accused did not follow the due process of law, which is available to any other citizen of this country, in case he had any grievance. It is inexplicable that he felt it more convenient to approach the Hon’ble Governor regarding a lawful investigation by police.”

Banerjee said that in her capacity as the chief minister she would “request, aid and advise” the governor to act within the mandate of the Constitution and not bypass her and her cabinet by communicating with state officers.

After the receipt of the letter, the governor tweeted that the DGP had not appeared before him as requested for the third time in a row and this cannot be overlooked. “As Communication @MamataOfficial has found its way in public domain I seek media to focus on my eye opener note @WBPolice. Significantly, unlike her earlier physical stance in support of cop @KolkataPolice, this time defence is by way of letter,” the governor said in his post.

493,['27/09/2020'],"IJ Ahluwalia, economist who broke glass ceilings, dies","Isher Judge Ahluwalia, one of India’s most influential economists and public policy thinkers , passed away on Saturday at the age of 74. She was known for her work on industrial development, macro-economic reforms and urban policy in a field largely dominated by men.

While married to Montek Singh Ahluwalia, former deputy chairperson of the Planning Commission, she stayed out of his shadow and maintained her own distinct identity. In 1984, she was sounded out for a chance to work with the government as deputy economic advisor in the industry ministry but turned it down. In her memoir, Breaking Through, which released while she was in the final stages of her battle with brain cancer, she writes, “I also made it plain that I felt they were engaging in gender discrimination because Montek had been offered the position of an economic advisor five years earlier when he was only 36. I was 39 and my qualifications were no less — in fact, they were greater as I had a PhD from MIT whereas Montek was not a PhD.” This point was often made to those who called their home asking for Dr Ahluwalia, to be met with the response: “This is she”.

She was the ninth of eleven siblings in a conservative Punjabi family that ran a small pickle business. Despite a tight financial situation, she was always an academic star. From scholarship to scholarship, she worked her way to Presidency College, Delhi School of Economics and finally, the economics department at MIT for her PhD, where her advisor was the Nobel-winning Paul Samuelson. Always independent-minded, she wrote a paper arguing against his positions on foreign direct investment, and still got a good grade.

In 1970, while she was writing her dissertation and interning at the IMF in Washington, she met Montek Singh Ahluwalia, who was then at the World Bank . She married him and moved back to India. She worked at the Centre for Policy Research and later as chairperson of the thinktank, Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), which she built into a redoubtable institution. She was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2009.

Her book on industrial growth in India, advocating the loosening of socialist controls, was published in 1985. While it met with a chilly reception in left-leaning circles (she was even accused of being funded by the CIA), its empirical rigour was difficult to question. Another book on the productivity and growth in Indian manufacturing was published in 1991. Later in her career, Isher pivoted to urban policy.

Through her life and career, she came into contact with many people who were later to decisively shape India’s economic future: from Amartya Sen and Bimal Jalan, to Manmohan Singh, who was instrumental in bringing the Ahluwalias back to India. She called herself a cheerleader for Manmohan Singh even as she expressed frustration at his government in the later UPA years. She even campaigned for the one election he fought and lost. The couple’s personal networks though cut across ideological lines.

In her memoir, she recollects borrowing money from Utsa Patnaik, who topped D School, while Isher came second. She also describes her friendships with women from the corporate world, like Kiran Mazumdar Shaw and Sudha Murty.

A Delhi court on Friday granted bail to former Fortis Healthcare promoter Malvinder Singh, primarily on the grounds of parity since his brother and co-accused Shivinder has already been granted bail in the case of alleged bank fraud.

Additional sessions judge Sandeep Yadav granted the relief after taking note of arguments by advocate Manu Sharma who submitted that his client’s brother Shivinder has already been granted bail in the same case earlier.

He also argued that none of the persons named in the FIR except Malvinder and Shivinder have been arrested despite the fact that the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police claimed that a “major offence” has been committed.

MUMBAI: BJP’s Pankaja Munde and Vinod Tawde , who for long have been out in the cold, have been brought back into the party’s mainstream. Both have been appointed national secretaries by the party on Saturday, along with 11 others. The appointments were made by BJP national president J P Nadda in Delhi. “They could be entrusted a task in another state or be put in charge of Yuva Morcha, Mahila Morcha or one of the many cells of the party,” a source said.

While Munde has been at loggerheads with former CM Devendra Fadnavis, Tawde was denied a ticket to contest the 2019 assembly elections. Munde lost the election to her cousin Dhananjay Munde, who is with NCP. Along with Munde and Tawde, Vijaya Rahatkar, who was heading the Mahila Morcha, has been appointed as national secretary after she completed her tenure. V Satish continues as national joint general secretary, while Jamal Siddiqui has been appointed as national president of the Minority Morcha.
