Several thousands of his fans thronged the Nandi Link Grounds, at Nayandahalli, for a gala midnight celebration, flanked a 216-foot cut out and a 5,700-kg cake. Yash turned up at the venue with his wife, actress Radhika Pandit , to greet and meet those who braved the winter night to wish their hero. The event was organised by Akhila Karnataka Rocking Star Yash Abhimanigala Sangha (R).Yash said, “Nanna preethiya annthammas. I have never given much importance to my birthday celebrations. Since my childhood, I had just one wish — I should not celebrate the fact that I was born, instead others should be happy on my birthday. Had I chosen another profession, I wonder if I would have got so much love and adulation. I feel blessed that I have chosen this path.”According to a source, people came in from Kerala Tamil Nadu , Telangana as well as different parts of Karnataka to get a glimpse of the actor and wish him. “Many even stayed overnight at the venue, so that they could interact with Yash and click photos with him,” the source added.A CAKE CUTTING LIKE NO OTHER: Yash and Radhika Pandit (above) were in awe of the 5,700 kg cake (right) made for Yash by fans.

1,['9/01/2020'],‘It was a surreal experience when Thalaivar said ‘Chumma Kizhi’’,"It’s not always easy to both end a year and begin another one on a grand note. But for Anirudh , this has happened. It was a Chumma Kizhi year-end for the youngster, with his songs for Rajinikanth ’s Darbar making waves in December. And now he’s having a happening new year, with the AR Murugadoss directorial hitting screens today, making it his first release of 2020. In a chat with us, the musician talks about working with AR Murugadoss and the Superstar again, how he would never miss releasing a Valentine’s Day single and why he doesn’t hate any trends…I always follow my heart. Whichever song excited me as a fan is what I’ve locked on. There are a few signature sounds for Thalaivar which I included, like the ‘hey hey’ and the Superstar theme.Actually, Chumma Kizhi was the first time he recorded a line for the song. It was a surreal experience for all at the studio when he said those words.The one you saw at the end of the making-of video — ‘Super Ani. Idhu theatre-la Chumma Kizhi dhaan’ (by Rajinikanth).It does not curb a musician’s freedom at all, as our musicians are as good as foreign musicians, if not better. Yes, I did use the orchestra from abroad extensively in this film. But the allegation surprised me as I have used hundreds of our native musicians regularly, from 3 till now. I missed out on the last couple of times due to schedule and availability constraints. But I will continue to use our musicians in my future films.I enjoy every moment, every note, every chord that I produce. The love of my fans keeps me going and helps me raise the bar every time.I hope so (smiles). It’s a tradition which I won’t miss. I have a couple of songs ready, but I will decide which one to release, depending on my mental state on V-Day.One trend that I loved is that there are so many new composers and producers all over the world. Technology has made music so accessible and the reach that we all have all around the world is because of that. I don’t hate any trend at all. If it’s a trend, it’s what the people are enjoying and that’s what I want to enjoy as well.This year, I hope to spend more time with people that matter.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73157100,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1151877/73157100.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/it-was-a-surreal-experience-when-thalaivar-said-chumma-kizhi/articleshow/73157100.cms
2,['9/01/2020'],Ek Haan allows me to express my take on Manto: Shekhar Suman,"Film and television actor Shekhar Suman is set to take the stage in Bengaluru as Saadat Hasan Manto in Ek Haan — a Hindi-Urdu play set in the early 1950s. He will share the stage with actress-singer Suchitra Krishnamoorthi, who will be seen as a Kashmiri journalist, named Wazira. The storyline explores the life and writings of Manto through the eyes of Wazira, who follows him from India to Pakistan . The conversation between them forms the crux of the narrative, with the focus also being on some of Manto’s popular stories such as Toba Tek Singh , Kali Salwaar and Thanda Gosht . Excerpts from an interview with Shekhar…I have a lot of respect for the audiences in Bengaluru. They are well-read and very responsive. Ek Haan, like my previous play Ek Mulaqaat, has a fair amount of Urdu dialogues. But I am sure, it will be received well by the people here, as it has been in other cities of the country. The memories of my previous performances in this city are very rewarding.As a child, one is introduced to different literary works by their parents, and it was the same was in my case too. Manto’s works echoed the real stories of his time, punctuated with excellent wordplay. His stories, particularly Toba Tek Singh are Kali Salwaar, are extremely well-written. You realise how good a writer Manto was when you pick up a book written by him immediately after finishing one.I haven’t seen many plays or movies on Manto earlier, which, in a way, I feel, is good, as I wanted to have my own interpretation of the great writer, and not get influenced by anything that I have seen before. This play has given me the opportunity to express my take on Manto, and if my hard work pays off, then the audience will probably remember that. In a way, it is also a sort of revival — introducing Manto to people who are not acquainted with his works.Working with Suchitra has been a wonderful experience. She’s quite the perfectionist, who puts in a lot of effort towards the portrayal of the character she plays. Also, for Ek Haan, the dedication with which she has learnt Urdu is praise-worthy. The interaction between Manto and Wazira in the play is organic, realistic and hard-hitting.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73155852,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-83642/73155852.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/theatre/ek-haan-allows-me-to-express-my-take-on-manto-shekhar-suman/articleshow/73155821.cms
3,['9/01/2020'],‘I deliberately did not reveal Darbar’s plot in the trailer’,"The excitement is palpable as Darbar , starring Rajinikanth and Nayanthara releases today. Director AR Murugadoss tells us how it was working with the Superstar, and more…The perception of a cop has changed over the years. Earlier, one would expect a cop to be bulky — but today, cops are expected to be fit. Rajini sir’s lean body and style suits today’s perception of a cop. Though he has done Moondru Mugam, Anbukku Naan Adimai and Hum, Darbar has him presented in a different manner. Initially, I wanted Rajini sir to play a retired cop. But after seeing him in Petta, I thought of presenting him as a young cop. The story, however, is the same as the original.I was a bit nervous in the first few days, I felt like this was my first movie. Later, I overcame the nervousness, but I was excited. I had certain expectations about how he would perform and deliver his dialogues. But to my surprise, he came up with different modulations for some of the dialogues. He would pause at unexpected places, turn back at some instances, and then laugh… I had a great time looking at him enacting the scenes I had written for him.Santosh sir works at a fast pace — this makes us more professional. He is an expert in maintaining the mood of a scene with his lighting pattern. For example, we are in the middle of shooting an emotional scene, and we take a break and return to complete the scene; the expression or the body language of the artiste may change without his/her knowledge. But Santosh sir knows how to correct it with lighting, and it is magical. Similarly, Anirudh is someone who keeps coming up with tunes even after you say enough. There was one song which I had already shot, but I asked him for another tune, and he gave it immediately, and we shot it again.As the film has a Mumbai backdrop, I needed an antagonist from there. I met him, and felt he would suit the role. He had a ponytail when I met him and that has been retained in the movie; also, his inclusion has made the film a pan-India project.It’s almost impossible to shoot a Rajini film in Tamil Nadu, also, since it’s a cop flick, we needed some real locations. Mumbai has an ultra-modern look on one side, and slum on the other side. It is the only city which has that contrasting ambience. Plus, I’m familiar with the city and it is a shooting-friendly place.Whenever my films’ trailers release, some controversies and rumours crop up — it’s as if some people are just waiting to criticise my film when it is about to release. So, this time, I decided not to encourage them.This is not a message-oriented film; it is a cop thriller which has lot more than action, heroism and gunshots. It also has emotional scenes. I have ensured that the fun element that’s there in Rajini sir’s films is retained.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73156978,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1274349/73156978.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/i-deliberately-did-not-reveal-darbars-plot-in-the-trailer/articleshow/73156978.cms
4,['9/01/2020'],Kalyani: People need to see more of me to know what I am capable of,"While Kalyani Priyadarshan made her debut with the Telugu film Hello more than two years ago, she has waited for her first leading role in her mother tongue, Malayalam. The reason, she says, had a lot to do with what her parents, Priyadarshan and Lissy , have accomplished in the industry. But her upcoming film Varane Avashyamund , directed by Anoop Sathyan and has Dulquer Salmaan , Suresh Gopi and Shobana as part of the cast, made it “well worth the wait”.The actress, who is also part of Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham and Vineeth Sreenivasan’s Hridyam this year, tells us about working in Varane Avashyamund, meeting Dulquer for the time and more.My favourite character has always been Karthumbi (Shobana’s role in Thenmavin Kombathu) and so, I have been a huge fan of hers. I grew up seeing her at our house. As a fangirl, however, there’s a difference between knowing her and watching her act. It was a big deal for me. On the first day, there was a retake and to maintain continuity, people were checking the monitors for the previous scene. But ma’am said, ‘I know what I did. I have worked without monitors all these years. If you guys want to have a check, go ahead’. She is that good. There’s no way I can do something like that. But, between action and cut is the only time she works; otherwise she’s like a child on the sets.Suresh Gopi sir was also fun to work with. He was very chilled to talk to and gives many inputs. He loves amma and kept telling me funny stories about her that I never knew.I grew up with Pranav. He and I have been best friends for the longest time. In fact, I introduce him to people as my cousin. That’s been our bond since childhood. We used to spend our holidays together. So, working with him was really comfortable and easy. I never went in expecting anything new, because I already knew him so well.But working with Dulquer was an opposite experience. The first words he ever said to me was on the day of this film’s pooja and it was, ‘Finally, we meet’. That was the first time we were properly meeting. I have never interacted with him before. There might have been a chance that we have seen each other in a film wedding or function as kids. I have known his wife (Amal Sufiya) but Dulquer was never part of my circle. I am close to the children of acha’s friends’. So, it was nice meeting Dulquer and getting to know him.A lot. I think any mother-daughter duo who argues would relate to their story. I think that’s what I liked about the character. You bond not just through love, but also through tiffs and the fun you share. The movie is not just about their bond though, there’s a lot else happening too.This team felt more like family. Despite Sathyan (Anthikad) uncle being someone whom I have met so many times in life as he and acha are close friends, I met Anoopetta for the first time when he came to narrate the story to me. I loved it and I immediately agreed to do it.The whole film takes place in a very small bubble, of these people’s lives. All of us started living in that bubble during the shoot. One of the first things that even Dulquer told me was, ‘Do you know why I think this film is special and it would work? Because the world he (Anoop) creates is small, but nice. I think the people that watch the film will feel like they want to be part of this small world’. We all felt it was true.I think people need to see more of me to know what I am capable of. In fact, that’s the reason I am excited about Varane Avashyamund, because the role I am playing is not something I have done before. And yet it’s still more me than the other characters I have played. I am really waiting for people to see this and tell me what they think because this is something that will show my potential a little bit more. I am excited about that.A lot of it has to do with the pressure of being my parents’ daughter. When I did a Malayalam movie, I wanted to be at a space where I was a bit more confident as an actor and at the same time, I wanted it to be a struggle as well. Sometimes, when you watch something, you ask, ‘Why did she do this role? There’s nothing for her to do’. I didn’t want that to happen. Acha spent almost 40 years making a name in the industry and I was scared that in just one film I could bring all that down. Though a newcomer, the pressures of everything they have done will be on me. I didn’t want that. So, I took a long time to decide which film to start with. But this movie is worth the wait.I did and acha was the happiest. For him, it is all about how positive he feels about a film. He said, ‘The people who are in the film are here for the right reasons. They are all smart and talented. This is best place for you, not just to be but to learn too’. Acha wants me to learn the right way, because he believes if you learn it wrong, it’s hard to unlearn. He also believes so much in Anoopetta’s ability, not because of who his dad is, but because of who he is and what he has done. I have learnt so much from him and it’s the same with Dulquer. He is the co-star I have learnt the most from. In fact, there were a lot of times when I felt unsure about my performance and a talk with him would help me understand and be okay with what I have done. He is that sort of person. Working with him and Shobana ma’am taught me a lot.Because I grew up in Chennai, I am more comfortable in Tamil. I think I probably would have watched slightly more Tamil movies than Malayalam films. So, it’s a language I am in touch with and it’s very special to be part of the Tamil film industry because I grew up watching the films. I am happy with the projects I have got so far and I am hoping I can be part of good projects in the future too.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73154509,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-66293/73154509.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/kalyani-people-need-to-see-more-of-me-to-know-what-i-am-capable-of/articleshow/73154509.cms
5,['9/01/2020'],Sunil Chhetri: I'm really greedy when it comes to goals,"Bengaluru FC (BFC) and India team captain Sunil Chhetri has had a great start to 2020, what with him scoring two goals against FC Goa in his club team’s first match of the year. For a while now, Chhetri has consistently been the top scorer and is among the top 10 players who have scored the most international goals. Not surprising, considering that the ace footballer says that the one thing he is greedy for on the field is scoring goals, adding that he has been fortunate to be a part of teams that have always stood by him and helped him achieve these feats. Excerpts...That’s a difficult question to answer. I have never ever had a long-term plan or a target. I just think about the next 10 days of training or the next game. If I were to summarise it in a holistic way, I just want to do better as a player and for BFC to improve as a team. I sincerely want BFC to win the league and qualify to the Champions League. But in this quest, we’re going to take one game at a time, which is my personal mantra as well. On a personal note, being more calm is another goal that I am looking at achieving.It is amazing; it is second to none in the entire country right now. We might not be there in terms of numbers, but the voice, passion and innovation that the fans bring to the table is amazing. The growth in the past six years has been tremendous. We have grown in terms of quality and depth. The fans are very important to our club and I know that they are aware of this. On behalf of the team, I’d say that the fans have played an important part in getting the club to where we are now.The stadium is very close to our hearts. When we got to know that there was a chance that we might not be able to play at the stadium any more, every one of us was really sad. We’re relieved and grateful that we got the stadium and I hope it stays this way. I know there are a lot of things involved in it and I don’t want to comment on that. But, as a team and a player, there are some amazing memories attached to the stadium and we are not done yet. We have to make a lot more memories on home ground. This is why the stadium is very important.It is beautiful. As the national captain, I think it is very heartwarming. It delights me when fans from other regions come to our homeground at Kanteerava Stadium or our fans travel with us elsewhere. This is a very important part of football growing in the country. It is not easy as far as the kind of time, money or interest that fans spend on their teams are concerned, but this kind of passion will go a long way in promoting the sport. Recently, when we played FC Goa, the fans there had their own banners and were very loud, making sure their appreciation was noted. I’m glad that the fans are taking the right strides in improving the popularity of the sport in the country.The secret is that I play for really good sides, by which I mean both BFC and the national team. I am a part of teams in which the players really help me get to the opportunities to score. I’ve said this before, I’m only the one who gets the cherry on top. People work really hard for me to get those chances. I’m not trying to be modest; I’m just being honest. In the last six years, I’ve been the highest scorer for the club, but that is only because of the team work involved in getting those chances.As far as those comparisons, I don’t pay any heed to them. It is not realistic. I am just happy that I score goals for my club and the country. I’m really greedy when it comes to goals. Every game that I play, irrespective of who it is against or where the game is being played, I always try to score well. Eventually, when I do score and the team gets three points because of that, it is very satisfying. Even though I don’t have a set number of goals in mind, when I start a season, I always give myself the best chance to score.To be with my family — sleep, snore and chit chatThat I love themFoodThere are 1,000 things.

Chandana, who spent 12 weeks in the house, tells us, “Honestly, I didn’t think I would last this long in the house. I had given myself five or maybe eight weeks at the most, going by the competition. I am really grateful to the people who supported me in my journey on the show.” The idea behind taking part in this season of Bigg Boss Kannada, says Chandana, was to give audiences a glimpse of her real self as well as her other talents. “People know me as a television actress, I wanted to show them that I have a bunch of other talents, which came to the fore during the various tasks that we had to do on the show. In fact, I did very well when I was the captain of the house. The show helped me showcase a different side of my personality,” she says.Her biggest takeaway from the stint, says Chandana, is that she learnt to take decisions and stick by them. “It doesn’t matter whether people like your opinion or not, it is up to you to take a stand and raise your voice whenever there is a need, especially against social injustices,” she says, adding that her fondest memories from the house include the morning wake up call, having a microphone on at all times and the time when Sudeep hugged her.Throughout her stay, Chandana always had smile on her face, irrespective of the mood in the house. “My smile is god’s gift to me. I believe that every problem can be solved with a smile; there is no need to shout at anyone. This is not something I adopted for the show. In fact, even at home, I am not known to lose my temper,” she says. Despite her affable nature, the actress was criticised for being close only to Shine Shetty and Vasuki Vaibhav. “The three of us share a great rapport, owing to our love for music, among other things. We used to sing songs and discuss music whenever we were free, which helped us bond. I don’t think we resorted to groupism in the house to harm other contestants,” she adds.Priyanka, because I don’t think she has been honest in her dealings in the house.

He will play the negative lead in ' Tenali Rama '.Confirming the news, Ajay said, “I felt that it was time now to explore my talent in a historical/mythological genre. Mytho or historical characters have a powerful reach as Indian audiences love them. I have always been part of social dramas and enjoyed playing real characters on screen. I felt there was a greater challenge lying in those characters than playing larger-than-life characters in mythological or historical shows. But, in the past few years I feel that though the content in social dramas is really good; every TV show starts with a great promise, the track or the characters. somewhere get lost as time progresses. This does not mean that social dramas are not good. ”Ajay was last seen playing the role of a father ('Rishton Ka Chakravyuh'), who does not love his own daughter. He said, “'=Rishton' had a good concept. It was a modern version of Mahabharat and every actor brought something to the table. However, as time progressed, the characters and story lost its steam. It stopped abruptly without a defined ending and that was disappointing.”Observing that high-quality content is ruling other platforms, Ajay said that television should also experiment with its content. He shares, “Now, actors have more options to explore their talent. Bollywood filmmakers are interested in making shows on other platforms. So, it is important that the content on social dramas as well as historical shows gets better on TV.”On the personal front, Ajay is married to actress Jyoti Makker, and they have a daughter, Jiyana. Jyoti quit acting after she became a mother in 2013.

Margao: NorthEast United FC have been dealt a huge blow with news that their star player Asamoah Gyan will have no further role to play in the Indian Super League ( ISL ).

Gyan, the only marquee player in this edition of the ISL, is understood to have picked up a grade 2 injury in training last week and has been ruled out for rest of the season.

According to team sources, NorthEast’s leading goal-scorer will need a minimum of eight weeks to recover, and by that time the ISL would be over.

“Yes, Gyan is injured unfortunately. He cannot play. It’s finished for him and I think in one or two days, we will have two new players,” said NorthEast United coach Robert Jarni after his side lost 0-2 against FC Goa at Fatorda on Wednesday.

A legend in Africa, the Ghanaian has featured in a record four World Cups and remains the highest scorer from Africa in the tournament's history with six goals.

With Gyan injured, Maximiliano Barreiro returning home due to family emergencies and Panagiotis Triadis contracted only till December – before Frederico Gallego filled the void – coach Jarni didn’t have much of a choice as he fielded four foreign players and pulled out Gallego in the second session to leave NorthEast with only three internationals.

Team sources said at least one new foreign player will be in Goa on Thursday itself.

Margao: FC Goa were made to sweat before scripting a 2-0 victory over NorthEast United FC in a Indian Super League ( ISL ) clash at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda , on Wednesday.

The home team struggled in the first half and needed a bit of luck in the second when NorthEast’s Croatian defender Mislav Komorski scored an own-goal. Ferran Corominas then converted a penalty after Leudo Romana was sent off in the 80th minute as the visitors were reduced to 10 men.

FC Goa’s win – their 100th match in the league across six seasons –helped them regain the top spot. They are now on 24 points from 12 matches and will travel to face second placed ATK (21 points) in a crucial encounter on January 18.

NorthEast remained eighth with 11 points, but have a game in hand.

FC Goa head coach Sergio Lobera was back on the sidelines after serving a one-match suspension where his side lost 1-2 to defending champions Bengaluru. The Spaniard doesn’t really like to surprise his opponents and fielded his usually predictable strongest starting 11.

The home side enjoyed superior ball possession from the start and build up confidence with every pass. Most of their moves came from the right where winger Jackichand Singh, Hugo Boumous and star striker Coro linked up on several occasions.

But they failed to pose a real threat to goalkeeper Pawan Kumar, who started ahead of first choice custodian Subhasish Roy Chowdhury, serving a suspension.

NorthEast head coach Robert Jarni knew how his opponents function having played a 2-2 draw in the first leg in Guwahati. The visitors started with only four foreigners with Ghanaian World Cupper Asamoah Gyan unavailable, and adopted defensive tactics. Captain Federico Gallego went forward occasionally in his first start of the season and never troubled goalkeeper Mohammad Nawaz.

At the other end, Coro came close with a bicycle kick while Carlos Pena’s half volley went wide. Before the break, Hugo tricked Reagan and moved dangerously but his cross was collected by Pawan before Coro could do any damage.

Just two minutes into the second session, Goa had a glorious opportunity to break the deadlock. However, with only Pawan to beat, Jackichand aimed straight at the goalkeeper, and Brandon Fernandes’ rebound was cleared on the line by defender Reagan Singh.

In the 68th minute, however, Jackichand made amends. Hugo played the ball to the Manipuri winger and he attempted a cross which Croatian centre-back Mislav Komorski guided into his own net.

Goa were determined to score more and waited patiently. In the 79th minute, Ahmed Jahouh flicked over a delightful ball in the path of Coro and he was brought down in the box by Leudo Romana. The Colombian was sent off and Coro converted the penalty with ease for his eighth goal of the season to put him back on top of the goalscorers chart alongside ATK’s Roy Krishna.

NEW DELHI: Looking to flex its trade muscles, an option India has not often resorted to, the Modi government is reviewing its economic engagement with Malaysia and may impose formal checks on shipment of palm oil and electronic goods in retaliation to Kuala Lumpur's stance on Kashmir and Islamic preacher Zakir Naik .

""We are looking at some curbs on refined and crude palm oil as well as electronics. Various ministries are involved in the exercise,"" a source in the government told TOI. It is perhaps the first such trade retaliation that India has used against a partner country.

India has run out of patience with what it sees as provocative statements by Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad on subjects like abrogation of J&K's special status, Citizenship (Amendment) Act and controversial preacher Zakir Naik, who is facing a probe by the NIA and the ED.

NEW DELHI: Flying time between India and the west - Europe and the Americas - will increase by up to 40 minutes with several airlines deciding to avoid overflying the Iranian airspace to steer clear of the US-Iran conflict zone in West Asia. The increase will be about 20 minutes for flights to and from Delhi and almost double for Mumbai.Airlines have not yet indicated if the increased flying time, that means higher operational expenses on fuel burn and other factors like crew, will lead to a fare hike. ""Let us see how long it continues. If it remains for long, we will have to pass on the expense to passengers,"" said an airline official.Iran launched missile attacks on bases housing American troops in Iraq in the early hours of Wednesday (local time Iran). Immediately after that, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) barred its carriers from overflying the airspace of Iran, Iraq and the waters of Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman as there is a ""potential for miscalculation or mis-identification"" that could endanger safety of civilian aircraft. The order was instantly applicable to all American airline and US-registered aircraft.A few hours later, DGCA ""directed"" Indian carriers to ""to take appropriate precautionary measures including rerouting their flights [from affected airspaces] in order to ensure complete safety of passengers.""Accordingly, Air India - the only Indian carrier currently flying to mainland Europe, the UK, US and Canada - and AI Express said they will not overfly Iran. Other big airlines like Lufthansa, Swiss, Air France and KLM said they won't be doing so either.American carriers United and Delta, which have direct flights between the US and Delhi and Mumbai, are barred from overflying that conflict zone by FAA's notice to airmen (Notam).""In light of the tensions within the Iranian airspace a decision to temporarily reroute flights of AI and AI Express overflying Iran has been taken,"" AI spokesperson Dhananjay Kumar said.The longer route will mean flights from India to the west will fly to Pakistan, towards Afghanistan and then go further up north to steer clear of Iranian airspace. The saving grace for all airlines is that Pakistan airspace is open.Other countries were to take their own call, though most usually follow US Notams.Flight tracking sites show a Mumbai-London and Bengaluru-London commercial flight were among those en route that had to divert after the FAA Notam.

16,['9/01/2020'],Nehha Pendse: What’s the big deal if my husband is twice divorced? I am not a virgin either,"It’s been barely four days since she tied the knot with Shardul Singh Bayas , a businessman, and TV actress Nehha Pendse is already fielding questions about her husband being twice divorced and having two daughters, after recent reports in the media.Speaking to BT, Nehha said, “What’s the big deal about this? Today, many of us are getting married late because of various reasons, including the focus on career. A lot of people end up having more than one relationship before finally tying the knot. The commitment, love and physical proximity could be the same as it is in a marriage, the only difference is that there is no legal stamp over it. So, why are people talking about Shardul being a divorcee? It’s not that I am a virgin either. I appreciate the fact that he took chances with women he was in love with, unlike in my case where the men disappeared just when the relationship could have culminated into marriage. At least, Shardul is not commitment-phobic. I salute him for his undying faith in the institution of marriage, it is easy to not believe in it after two failed marriages. That shows that he is a man of substance unlike those who fear the idea of getting married. I also feel that if a marriage is not working out, one should end it rather than drag on.”Nehha said that she never intended to hide the fact that Shardul was previously married. “I knew that this would come up at some point and was open to talking about it. Shardul and I have accepted each other’s past wholeheartedly, so there is no fear of talking about it. As I had mentioned in my previous interview to BT, we would hardly have romantic conversations during the initial months of our relationship; there was a lot of talking, but about our lives. Both of us are damaged and hence, careful and sensitive about our relationship.”Nehha has met Shardul’s first wife and his two children and is in fact, friends with his elder daughter on social media. “His first marriage ended around 10 years ago and second, five years ago,” she said, adding, “They (his first wife and daughters) were gracious enough to meet me and I realised that their relationship had ended amicably. They were young when they got married and made some mistakes. But what’s important is that they remain cordial and Shardul is a doting father.”Nehha said that she is a practical person and her expectations from the marriage are realistic. “Let’s be honest. Who knows what the future holds for us? I am extremely practical and aware of the fact that anything can go wrong even in a seemingly strong relationship. I have been married for just a few days, and can’t predict how things can change in a few years. All I can say is, I am open to embracing everything that life has to offer me. Janam-janam ka saath is restricted to just films, real life is a lot more than that. On the positive side, I think Shardul won’t make the mistakes that a rookie husband might. He knows better what works in a marriage and what doesn’t. He will know before me when we have headed in the wrong direction and will guide me through it,” she signed off.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73156796,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-60833/73156796.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/nehha-pendse-whats-the-big-deal-if-my-husband-is-twice-divorced-i-am-not-a-virgin-either/articleshow/73156796.cms

The actress was recently in Jaipur to celebrate the New Year with her husband, Gautam Rode . The couple tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Alwar in 2018 and will complete two years this February. The actress mentioned that the desert state holds a special place in both their hearts. “I’ve visited Rajasthan a lot of times, especially Jaipur. Gautam is from Delhi and I have lived in Delhi for 10-12 years. We often come to Jaipur for holidays. The city is so colourful and rich in culture and traditions. I love the architecture of the city and shopping in the walled city is an experience in itself,” she said.Pankhuri Awasthy and Gautam Rode in JaipurThough she has been getting a lot of offers for web shows, the actress has always stayed away. When we asked her about it, she said she isn’t comfortable going bold onscreen which is usually the first question the makers for web shows ask. “I get a lot of offers for web shows, but I am not comfortable doing bold scenes. Every time I get a call for a web show, they start by saying, ‘bold scenes hai.’ Also, I feel that a scene like that should make sense and not just be an addition to grab eyeballs.”She mentioned that not just her, but even her husband finds doing intimate scenes onscreen uncomfortable. “The moment we are told that we’re required to perform intimate scenes, the first thing that comes out of our mouth is ‘no’. Maybe, because we haven’t done it before. Having said that, we’ve never imposed restrictions on each other. But I know that even Gautam will agree to a project with intimate scenes if the script demands it,” she added.Though Pankhuri’s character in one of the longest running TV show YRKKH is about to come to an end, she had a fulfiling experience. “I joined the show to play a cameo for three months. When I was confirmed for Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, a day later I was also finalised for YRKKH. The shooting for the film was supposed to begin from September. So, I had some free time, which is why I took up YRKKH. But my track got extended and it’s been almost eight months since I’ve been shooting for the daily soap. I have no complaints as this show is a legacy in itself and my character has a lot of shades. I am happy that playing a different character like Vedika has added value to my career,” she said.So, what next? We asked. To which, she replied, “I am excited and nervous about my Bollywood debut. I haven’t chalked out a plan yet. But I am hoping that interesting projects come my way and I get to choose the best of what I am offered.”Opening up about reality shows, the actress said, “I don’t know if I am meant for reality shows.

Second, add the grains or a protein like quinoa or egg.

Follow this with chopped veggies like carrots, cucumbers, zucchini or even pulses like chickpea and mung.

Softer veggies like tomatoes and avocado are added on top so they stay better.

Now, add seeds like roast pumpkin and chia as well as nuts like walnuts.

Let your leafy greens be added last with a sprinkling of herbs if you like.

When you are about to eat, give the jar a shake to evenly spread the dressing in the jar.

Picture this. You’re leaving for work and reach for your lunch box and to take with you. But hold on to that thought. How about simply adding your food to a mason jar and packing that to carry with you to office? It’s something that you could have done last night, it’s portable, great for holding layered food like salads, soupy noodle meals and is visually appealing, too. In fact, those granola layers with strawberries and yoghurt or even red velvet cake pictures are Instagram-gold!There are immense possibilities with this transparent jar trend. Most popular is a layered salad that can be assembled in it. Restaurants are serving juices and other drinks in mason jars. You can also serve a pie, ravioli, lasagna and other dishes in the jar. Says food expert Isha Marwani, “You can enjoy sushi in a mason jar, too, though it would be in a deconstructed form. Take a smaller sized jar, add some brown rice to it, followed by seaweed, sliced carrot, avocado and ginger, and add some sushi vinegar to it along with lime juice. Top it with a little wasabi and you are set.”Indian food isn’t far behind either. Reveals senior corporate manager Elson Sequeira, “I recently went to a wedding where biryani was served in mason jars. What struck me was that these jars were the perfect size when you crave something and yet want to exercise portion control, especially for a heavier dish. I do believe mason jars are here to stay.”Don’t stop at cakes or trifles, there’s a lot more that makes its way into a mason jar. Affirms chef Pooja Dhingra, “It’s so versatile, that it works well for Indian desserts. I’d go with a kheer, perhaps a rich shahi tukda with varq, a colourful falooda with vermicelli and even a seasonal gajar halwa topped with toasted pistachios and other dryfruit.”Says foodie Shradha Agarwalla, “I have created so many desserts in the mason jar. You can also do everyday granola layers with mousse or lemon curd.

PM Narendra Modi (ANI photo)

GUWAHATI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday cancelled his proposed visit to Assam for the inauguration of the 3rd Khelo India Youth Games on Friday, making it the second time in less than a month that he has called off a trip to the state against the backdrop of the anti-citizenship law agitation .

The All Assam Students Union (Aasu) and other organisations at the forefront of the protests had threatened to unleash the ""anger of the people"" on Modi if he decided to go ahead with the trip.

""The Prime Minister is not coming to inaugurate the games. The chief minister ( Sarbananda Sonowal ) is flying to New Delhi tomorrow and is likely to meet him. We will discuss with the state leadership if we can extend an invitation to the PM for the closing ceremony on January 22,"" a state government official said.

Sources in the PMO said Modi's scheduled programmes in West Bengal on the same day were clashing with the invitation by Assam, which is why he had to opt for the former. An alternative plan was to have him inaugurate the sporting event via video-conferencing, but that didn't work out either, the sources said.

Avinash Joshi, chief executive officer of the Khelo India Youth Games, chose to keep it open-ended, saying there was ""no confirmation from the PMO till now on the invitation to the Prime Minister "". State BJP spokesperson Dewan Dhruba Jyoti Maral gave a similar statement.

A PIB statement issued in the evening said Sonowal and Union minister Kiren Rijiju would attend the inauguration along with a bevy of star athletes.

Modi was to have hosted his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe at a bilateral summit in Guwahati on December 15 and 16, but the violent start to the anti-CAA agitation forced the Centre to ""postpone"" the meeting to a still undecided date.

Sources said what made the PMO decide against accepting the invitation to the Khelo India event were the protests inside Barsapara Stadium during Sunday's India-Sri Lanka T20 match. Some spectators had booed Sonowal and finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.

On Tuesday, Aasu adviser Samujjal Bhattacharjee said in Delhi that the people were happy over the games being held in Guwahati, but had different feelings for Modi.

""While we won't do anything to disturb Khelo India, we will hold peaceful protests if the PM visits Assam during the games,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: European diplomats will not be part of a group of envoys who will be taken to the Kashmir Valley on Thursday in a visit facilitated by the foreign office.

The group of envoys are scheduled to travel and return on Friday. It includes envoys mainly from Latin American and African countries. They will meet civil society leaders and will be briefed on the security situation by the Army and intelligence services.

The countries whose envoys would be part of the delegation include USA, Vietnam, South Korea, Uzbekistan, Nigeria, Morocco, Guyana, Argentina, Philippines, Maldives, Bangladesh and Peru. Official sources dismissed reports about EU envoys' refusal to go to Kashmir . ""We wanted to take a global group of envoys to J&K with only some EU ambassadors, and not all EU envoys were asked to join. However, EU envoys wanted to visit J&K as a group, which was not possible to accommodate due to restrictions in number and to keep the group broad-based,"" said a source.

Government sources clarified that members of the groups will be ""free to interact with people subject to security considerations. In any case, no ambassador had specifically asked to meet anyone who was detained.""

After 23 members of European Parliament visited Kashmir in October, the government had said it would repeat the exercise. The envoys will meet Lt Governor GC Murmu and other officials before returning the next day.

A source said, ""We have been receiving requests from some envoys based in Delhi to undertake a visit to the J&K. Our consistent position has been that we may consider the request only after analysing the security situation and checking the situation on the ground with the J&K administration.

Accordingly, a group of around 15 Envoys based in Delhi are being taken to J&K on 9-10 January to see first-hand the efforts being made by the government to bring the situation to normal.""

The government plans to take more envoys in the coming weeks as it is keen to showcase normalcy in the valley, though security restrictions remain.

This will be the second visit of a foreign delegation to Kashmir since August 5, 2019, the day when the Centre withdrew special status of the state and also bifurcated it into 2 UTs.

24,['9/01/2020'],"No kid killed in Muzaffarpur shelter, skeletons were of adults: CBI to SC","This story is from January 9, 2020

NEW DELHI: CBI on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that the allegations of 11 children of Muzaffarpur shelter home being killed were found to be false as it did not find any evidence pointing to murder of any child after completing investigations against 17 such homes. The agency added that those missing had been traced.

Attorney General KK Venugopal, appearing for CBI, informed a bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant that two skeletons excavated were found to be of a woman and a man. He said all girls who went missing have been traced by the investigation agency. The investigation into murder charges was carried out after some of the rape survivors told the agency that some of the girls were killed by main accused Brajesh Thakur .

The agency said it found that children in 13 out of 17 shelter homes were subjected to torture and sexual abuse and chargesheet have been filed against the NGOs and their officials.

Advocate Shoeb Alam, appearing for petitioner Nivedita Jha, contended that the agency had not investigated all aspects including role of outsiders and officials who were involved in sexual assault on the inmates after administering them intoxicants and human trafficking .

In its earlier affidavit, CBI had said, ""The victims during their examination in the presence of experts of NIMHANS had revealed names of 11 girls who were allegedly murdered by Brajesh Thakur and his accomplices.

These allegations are being duly investigated in the right earnest in the instant case by scrutinising the master register maintained at the Balikagrih to locate the bodies and through field level verification."" The court, after a brief hearing, allowed him to file his reply on CBI's probe report and adjourned the hearing. It, however, allowed CBI's plea to relieve two officers - 1996 batch IPS officers Bhanu Bhaskar and Devendra Singh - from the investigation team.

The court had ordered CBI probe against shelter homes after cases of harassment and sexual abuse were reported in 17 of 110 shelter homes which were audited by Tata Institute of Social Sciences(TISS). The institute had put those homes under the category of ""grave concern"" and submitted report to state but no action was taken by the government against them till the Muzaffarpur case came to light.

Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan (TOI file photo)

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday approved viability gap funding (VGF) of Rs 5,559 crore for a gas pipeline network proposed to be built in the northeast, the second instance of public funding for making an energy lifeline economically viable.

Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the VGF amount sanctioned by the Cabinet's panel on economic affairs will cover 60% of the Rs 9,265-crore project. The 1,656-km pipeline will connect Guwahati in Assam to major cities in the region such as Itanagar, Dimapur, Kohima, Imphal, Aizawl, Agartala, Shillong, Silchar, Numaligarh and Gangtok.

He said the pipeline will enable to pipe cooking gas to households and supply CNG (compressed natural gas) for automobiles in the northeast ""just like in Delhi"" as well as to fuel industry. The government had in 2016 sanctioned a capital grant of Rs 5,176 crore, or 40% of the cost, for Urja Ganga, the 2,655-km Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra (JHBDPL) gas pipeline being built by state-run GAIL . All other pipelines have been funded by public or private companies.

The northeast pipeline grid is to be implemented by Indradhanush Gas Grid, a joint venture of GAIL, IndianOil, ONGC, Oil India Ltd and Numaligarh Refinery Ltd. The consortium had told the government the project would not be viable in the absence of government funding as there were not enough large customers.

GAIL is also laying a 750-km line from Barauni to Guwahati as part of the Rs 12,940 crore JHBDPL project, which is also known as the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga project. This is proposed to be connected to the Northeast via the Indradhanush grid. Pradhan said the project is critical for implementing the Hydrocarbon Vision 2030 for the north-east, which entails leveraging the region's hydrocarbon potential for enhancing access to clean fuel and accelerating economic growth.

""About 20% of India's natural gas production comes from the north-east. Out of about 75 million cubic meters per day of gas output, 15 come from north-east... Currently Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura have established gas production potential while there are possibilities for the same in Nagaland and Manipur,"" Pradhan said. The funding support to the gas grid is part of the government's goal to raise the share of natural gas in the country's energy basket to 15% by 2030 from 6% at present.

26,['9/01/2020'],Can rabies patients opt for euthanasia?,"This story is from January 9, 2020

File photo for representation

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought the Centre's response to a PIL seeking right to passive euthanasia for persons afflicted with rabies , which has a 100% fatality rate, and is accompanied by extreme pain which is unmitigable by medicine.

Abench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant sought responses of ministries of health and family welfare, as well as ministry of environment, forest and climate change, after senior advocate Sonia Mathur pointed out that the SC's 2018 judgment allowing passive euthanasia left out persons suffering from rabies.

On March 9, 2018 in a milestone verdict, a five-judge Constitution bench of SC had ruled that right to life includes right to die and legalised passive euthanasia by allowing creation of a 'living will' that could provide terminally ill patients or those in persistent vegetative state (PVS), with no hope of recovery, a dignified exit by refusing medical treatment or life support system.

A person can write a 'living will' when in a sound state of mind, the SC had specified. Demanding recognition of right to die with dignity available to rabies patients , petitioner Anjali Gopalan's NGO ""All Creatures Great and Small"" said the SC's 2018 judgement did not envisage ""a situation where death is inevitable regardless of assistance of medical facilities. In such a situation, when the dignity of patient is jeopardised by the nature of the disease itself, it calls for different treatment for such patients"".

Referring to the judgment, the NGO, through Mathur, said the ruling left out a class of persons suffering from rabies. The NGO said, ""Rabies has 100% fatality rate and is unlike other diseases such as cancer where almost all forms carry a certain percentage of survival rate.""

Quoting data from National Health Profile 2018, the NGO said, ""There were 4,370 rabies deaths in India in 2016, which was one-third of worldwide rabies deaths at 13,340."" It said rabies can be prevented only through vaccination but complained of acute shortage in West Bengal, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Manipur.

According to WHO, there are 25 million dogs in India, which reports 1.75 million dog-bites every year. ""These unique symptoms of rabies make it an exceptional case where the patients have to be tied and shackled to their beds reducing their personal freedom, movement, dignity and integrity,"" it said.

""The death caused by rabies is deeply agonising as patients suffer from delirium, ataxia, paresis, aggressiveness, anxiety, fearfulness and hydrophobia in severe degree. The predominant fact that needs to be considered is that the disease, despite the advances made by medical science today, has no cure or treatment,"" it said and highlighted that only prevention could be done through vaccination,"" the NGO said.

NEW DELHI: Murder convict and former RJD MP Mohd Shahabuddin on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court challenging his solitary confinement in Tihar Jail where he was shifted in February 2017 from Siwan jail in Bihar on the orders of the apex court.

Abench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to go through Shahabuddin's petition after the history-sheeter's counsel Salman Khrushid said his client has been kept in ""in complete isolation"" and cannot communicate with anyone outside the jail Though the bench asked Mehta to go through the petition and inform ""what is to be done"", it told Khurshid that ""it is not the court's job to determine whether a person was danger to others or not. But, we are not expressing any opinion on the petition at present"".

The SC had on February 15, 2017 ordered shifting of Shahabuddin, who is serving life for the murder of three brothers, to Tihar on a petition filed by Asha Ranjan, wife of slain journalist Rajdeo Ranjan, and Chandrakeshwar Prasad whose three sons were murdered by the former MP. They had alleged that Shahabuddin was influencing witnesses even while in jail.

28,['9/01/2020'],"50 years on, 80-year-old to be paid for land","This story is from January 9, 2020

NEW DELHI: Coming to the rescue of an 80-year old woman whose land was taken without her consent by Himachal Pradesh government more than a half century back for road construction, the Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the state to pay her compensation along with Rs 10 lakh as litigation cost .

The land, measuring about 3.34 hectares, was acquired by the state government in 1967 for construction of road in Hamirpur district.

The road was built in 1975, but the woman, an illiterate widow coming from a rural background, was unaware of her rights and entitlement under law, and did not file any proceedings for compensation. She was not even aware that her land had been taken over by the government and came to know only in 2010 when the HC passed order in favour of some other land-owners in her village.

The 80-year-old woman then approached HC for relief but the court asked her to file a civil suit after which she moved the SC. The state government had invoked the doctrine of adverse possession to claim ownership of the land saying it has been in continuous possession of the land for over 42 years and the woman can't claim ownership.

Rejecting the state government's plea that there has been inordinate delay on the part of the woman to approach court, a bench of Justices Indu Malhotra and Ajay Rastogi said, ""The appellant has been divested of her right to property without being paid any compensation whatsoever for over half a century. The cause of action in the present case is a continuing one, since she was compulsorily expropriated of her property in 1967 without legal sanction or following due process of law. The present case is one where the demand for justice is so compelling since the state has admitted that the land was taken over without initiating acquisition proceedings, or any procedure known to law. We exercise our extraordinary jurisdiction under Articles 136 and 142 of the Constitution, and direct the State to pay compensation.""

File photo for representation

NEW DELHI: In a significant order that could help increase availability of cattle fodder , the Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Centre to make it mandatory for lease-holders of mines to re-grass the entire mining area after closure of operations to extract minerals.

The order came from a bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant more than a year after the CJI-led bench had suggested incorporation of a condition in the mining lease to specify that it was the lease holders' responsibility to restore the mined area, after closure of operations, to allow growth of grass and other vegetation.

The bench took cognizance of deleterious effect of mining on vegetation, especially after mining activities are over. Most abandoned mines become unproductive and unapproachable land with huge pits and are classified as hazardous to environment.

The SC order mandating mine lease-holders to restore closed mines will meet the growing need for fodder, which will help India meet the rising demand for milk. Pasture-land has been shrinking in the country--from 14,810 hectares in 1966 to 10,258 hectares in 2017.

The CJI-led bench's order said, ""In particular, it is observed that an area which is mined results in complete elimination of grass which in turn denies fodder to the herbivores . The only solution can be re-grassing of such mined areas. It is not in dispute that re-grassing technology is available in this country.""

The SC said the Centre will devise appropriate methods ""for ensuring compliance of this condition after the mining activity is over at the cost of the mining lease-holders"".

""This condition shall be in addition to those conditions which have already been imposed for achieving the same purpose under the mine closure plan. This condition shall not be imposed in derogation of any conditions which are already in force,"" it said and asked the Union government to report compliance within four weeks.

30,['9/01/2020'],SC to hear plea challenging its madrassa ruling,"This story is from January 9, 2020

NEW DELHI: Two days after the apex court held that rules can be framed by government to appoint teachers in aided minority institutions , a madrassa managing committee of West Bengal on Wednesday moved the court seeking re-examination of the verdict claiming it was contradictory to its earlier ruling.

Appearing before a bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant, senior advocate Salman Khurshid contended that the judgement, delivered by a two-judge bench on January 6, should be stayed and the issue examined by a larger bench as it was in contradiction to the apex court's earlier ruling.

The court agreed to hear the plea next week.

In an important judgment with implications for all government-aided minority educational institutions in the country, the court had on Monday held that such institutions cannot claim absolute right to appoint teachers as this can be regulated by government to ensure excellence in education.

Abench of Justices Arun Mishra and UU Lalit had upheld the constitutional validity of the West Bengal Madrassas Service Commission Act , 2008, under which selection and appointment of teachers in madrassas is to be decided by a commission. It set aside a Calcutta high court verdict declaring various provisions of the law unconstitutional for violating Article 30 which confers on all minorities, religious or linguistic, the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. Challenging the verdict, the managing committee of Contai Rahamania High Madrasah alleged that minority communities are entitled to establish and administer their institutions which includes the right to appoint teachers of their choice.

31,['9/01/2020'],SC to government: Why not have a CISF wing for courts?,"This story is from January 9, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Union government to explore possibility of creating a special wing of Central Industrial Security Force ( CISF ) for providing security to courts across the country, including the high courts and the SC.

Hearing a PIL filed by Pradyuman Bisht seeking installation of CCTV cameras in courts to prevent increasing unruly incidents within court premises, a bench of CJI SA Bobde and Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta whether it was possible for the Union government to carve out a special wing of CISF dedicated to provide security to courts.

""The Delhi incidents (pitched battle between lawyers and police in Tis Hazari) would not have happened if there was a dedicated special force providing security to to courts,"" the CJI said. The bench also asked amicus curiae Sidharth Luthra to give his views on another petition filed by advocate Karunakar Mahalik seeking creation of a special force to protect courts.

Mahalik had cited frequent violent incidents in court premises, including the Tis Hazari violence and gunning down of a woman lawyer inside the premises of an Agra court. Madras HC security was handed over to CISF in 2015 by the HC following unruly behaviour of a section of lawyers.

Luthra said implementation of security measures for court premises could not yield desired results without the cooperation of the advocates and suggested to the bench to seek views of Bar Council of India , the regulatory body for advocates. The SC issued notice to BCI on these two petitions.

On April 5 last year, the SC had directed creation of a ""dedicated cell in the high courts where footage of CCTV cameras from all subordinate courts and all tribunals in the territorial jurisdiction of the HCs may be viewed from time to time and observations to the extent relevant are compiled"".

On March 28, 2017, the SC had directed that ""at least in two districts in every state/Union territory (with the exception of small states/Union Territories where it may be considered to be difficult to do so by the concerned HCs) CCTV cameras (without audio recording) may be installed inside the courts and at such important locations of the court complexes as may be considered appropriate"".

The SC had said that CCTVs so installed could be monitored in the chamber of district and session judge concerned. ""Location of the district courts and any other issues concerning the subject may be decided by respective HCs. We make it clear that the footage of CCTV cameras will not be available under the RTI and will not be supplied to anyone without permission of the HC concerned.""

NEW DELHI: The Navy is on standby to deploy warships for emergency evacuation of Indians if the Iranian missile strikes on US-led forces in Iraq escalate into a wider conflict in the middle east region.

The Navy currently has a warship, the 4,000-tonne stealth frigate INS Trikand , deployed in the Gulf of Oman as part of the ongoing ""Operation Sankalp"", which was launched in June last year to safeguard Indian flagged vessels transiting through the Strait of Hormuz after some maritime security incidents in the region.

""INS Trikand can be diverted to help in the evacuation if it's required. The Navy is also keeping a couple of warships on full operational readiness, with all supplies, if they have to head towards the Middle-East,"" said an official.

Similarly, the IAF can deploy its heavy-lift aircraft like the C-17 Globemaster-III for the evacuation if the need arises.

""Both Navy and IAF have helped in evacuating stranded Indians from trouble-spots earlier. Indian warships, for instance, had evacuated Indians as well as foreign nationals from war-torn Yemen under Operation Rahat in early-2015,"" said the official.

Indian warships have been maintaining a continuous presence in both anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden as well as Operation Sankalp.

""Indian warships and aircraft were deployed to provide a sense of reassurance to the Indian merchantmen, monitor the ongoing situation and respond to any emergent crises. The Navy continues to monitor the situation in the Gulf region,"" said another official.

Northern Army Commander Lt General Ranbir Singh during his visit to China. (ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: Northern Army Command chief Lt General Ranbir Singh is now leading a high-level delegation to China to hold talks with top generals of the People's Liberation Army, in continuance of the policy to boost military-to-military interactions after the Doklam troop stand-off led to a total freeze for several months in 2017-2018.

Officers on Wednesday said Lt-Gen Singh held a meeting with Gen Han Weiguo, commander of the PLA ground forces, to discuss the regional security environment as well as measures to ""further enhance peace and tranquility"" along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which stretches from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.

The Indian delegation is also scheduled to visit military and civil establishments in Beijing, Chengdu, Urumqi and Shanghai during the five-day visit. ""It will help to further cement ties between the two countries through the high-level talks for military cooperation and stabilisation of the sensitive border,"" said an Army officer.

The visit also comes soon after India and China held their ""Hand-in-Hand"" (HiH) combat exercise, a major confidence-building measure, at Umroi near Shillong in Meghalaya last month. The Army top brass is optimistic that the situation along the LAC will further improve, with the two armies now actively working to reduce and manage troop confrontations, as was reported by TOI earlier.

The first informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jingping at Wuhan in April 2018 had led to ""strategic guidance"" to the two militaries to defuse troop confrontations during patrolling in accordance with existing protocols and mechanisms.

Though the two countries are yet to operationalise the long-pending hotline between top military commanders, officers say there is now better implementation of CBMs as well as greater interaction between local commanders on the ground.

Bilateral border tensions have certainly reduced since the 73-day troop confrontation in the Bhutanese territory of Doklam near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction in June-August 2017, which saw the two armies move additional infantry battalions, tanks, artillery and missile units towards the border.

But though the two armies disengaged from the face-off site after hectic diplomatic parleys, the PLA has constructed military infrastructure and helipads as well as permanently stationed around 600-700 troops in north Doklam.

The rival troops also continue to aggressively patrol to lay claim to the 23 ""disputed and sensitive areas"" along the LAC, which sometimes lead to ""transgressions and troop face-offs"" due to ""differing perceptions"" of the unresolved boundary, say officials.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra home minister and NCP politician Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday said he had demanded a detailed report on the Koregaon-Bhima case , including its current status, and also said that if there is a demand from someone with enough proof, then he will reopen the Justice Loya case .

Deshmukh said in the earlier BJP government, anyone who spoke against the administration was being termed as an 'Urban Naxal'. He added he had asked for information in the cases in which such a thing had happened. ""Whoever disagreed with their views were termed as 'Urban Naxals' and this is wrong. The previous government had set an example in this regard,"" he said.

The term 'Urban Naxal' was used by Pune police probing the alleged links between the Elgaar Parishad conclave of December 31, 2017 and the caste clashes around Koregaon-Bhima in Pune district the next day. ""I will be holding a meeting with senior police officials and other government pleaders regarding the Koregaon-Bhima case. I have asked for details of the case, judgments given by the courts and the hearings done by the government-appointed committee in the case,"" he said. He also said that if someone demands the case of Justice Loya's death can also be re-opened.

NCP chief Sharad Pawar had in December demanded that a Special Investigation Team be set up under a retired judge to probe the action taken by police in the Koregaon-Bhima case.

40,['9/01/2020'],Hectic lobbying for 5 RS seats falling vacant in April,"This story is from January 9, 2020

PATNA: Hectic lobbying has started for the five Rajya Sabha seats in Bihar falling vacant as Harivansh, Kahkashan Perween and Ram Nath Thakur from JD(U) and Dr C P Thakur and R K Sinha from BJP are to complete their terms on April 9 this year. The biennial election is likely to be held in March.

The MLAs cast vote to elect the Rajya Sabha members from the state. In Bihar, the first preferential votes of 42 legislators are required for a candidate to win a Rajya Sabha seat. As per the existing strength of different parties in the 243-member state assembly, RJD would be able to win two of the five Rajya Sabha seats as it has 81 MLAs and support of smaller allies.

Similarly, JD(U), BJP and LJP with the combined strength of 126 MLAs would be able to get three nominees elected to the Upper House of Parliament.

Since JD(U) has 70 MLAs compared to BJP’s 54, Nitish Kumar’s party would naturally field two nominees and the saffron party one. Thus, Lalu Prasad’s RJD would gain two seats while JD(U) and the BJP will lose one seat each. That’s why RJD has more aspirants than other parties and they have already started meeting the party’s top leaders like Lalu Prasad, former CM Rabri Devi and the leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav to seek their blessings.

“Three of the aspirants recently called on incarcerated Lalu, who is convicted in fodder scam cases and now admitted to Riims, Ranchi, on health grounds,” an RJD leader said.

RJD insiders said senior leaders like Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Jagdanand Singh, Shivanand Tiwary, Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav and Bulo Mandal are among the contenders for a Rajya Sabha seat. Party’s sitting RS member Prem Chand Gupta, who was last time elected from Jharkhand, also met Lalu in Ranchi recently. Gupta, insiders said, is learnt to have also staked his claim on one seat. Gupta’s current term in the Rajya Sabha is to end on April 9 and this time he wants to be elected from Bihar, sources said.

“RJD has many senior leaders who really deserve Rajya Sabha nomination. Any decision regarding candidates will be taken by Lalu Prasad and Tejashwi Ji. The party has already authorized them to take such decisions,” RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan told TOI on Wednesday.

BJP also has many aspirants for the single RS seat. Insiders said the party’s central leadership has hinted to prefer someone from the younger lot. A sitting Rajya Sabha member is lobbying for his son, if he is denied re-entry in the Upper House. “Top leadership of BJP will take a decision at the appropriate time,” Bihar BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand told TOI.

Since JD(U) is to lose one seat, at least one of its three sitting members is to be denied a ticket, if the party decides to repeat the two present members. “The party may like to change all its members like it did in 2014 when N K Singh, Shivanand Tiwary and Sabir Ali were asked to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha election,” a senior JD(U) leader said.

“In JD(U), the decision on RS candidates was taken only by the party chief Nitish Kumar and that, too, just a day or hours before the time of filing nomination papers,” a JD(U) leader said.

PATNA: The nationwide strike called by several trade unions and youth political wings on Wednesday against the policies of the central government had a mixed response in the state.

In Patna, CITU, AITUC and CPI-ML among other trade unions blocked Dak Bungalow roundabout causing traffic congestion on joining Exhibition Road, Fraser Road, Bailey Road and Bhattacharya Road and adjoining lanes. Several workers of HAM(S) and its youth wing carried out an ‘Aakrosh March’ near Gandhi Maidan and joined the protest at Dak Bungalow roundabout.

AISF, AISA, AIDSO, Bhim Army, SFI and NSUI among others tried to stop trains at Rajendra Nagar Terminal, but police chased them away and detained four members of the student organizations. The youth wings of political organizations were protesting against CAA-NPR-NRC and showing solidarity with the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University and Jamia Millia Islamia.

Public and public transport in the city was as usual. Schools, colleges, shops, market areas, malls and hangouts remained open. The banking services were partially affected as only government bank employees were protesting. CITU and AITUC forcefully shut some private banks on Exhibition Road, but they opened again after a short duration. The Joint Forum of Unions and Associations of Airport Authority India (AAI), Patna, held mass demonstration at the city airport, but did not disturb flight operations and other aviation works.

However, normal life was affected in Begusarai as activists of various trade unions squatted on the NH-31 and disrupted traffic. Banks and insurance offices remained closed. Deputy general secretary of Barauni Telshodhak Mazdoor Union (BTMU) Rajnish Ranjan said as many as 19 unions of IOCL associated with its refinery, pipeline and marketing divisions remained on strike. Loading of oil tankers at depots of various oil firms like HPCL, IOCL and BPCL was severely affected.

Banking services were completely paralysed in Bhagalpur and Banka districts. Most of the banks and insurance offices did not open. But transport and other services were not hit by the strike. Markets were open and the trading and business activities remained normal. Bank customers, however, returned disappointed. A section of bank employees also protested against the central government’s decision to merge many banks and thereby causing uncertainty among the bank employees, who also apprehend about impending steps to close some bank branches across the country.

There was a mixed response in Bagaha as well. The main protest was seen at West Champaran collectorate where CITU, AICCTU, AITUC and INTUC members forcibly closed its gates for some time. Sunil Rao, Milan Aiman, Rabindra Kumar, Birendar Gupta and others participated in the protest, which included against NRC, CAA, NPR, JNU incidents. Work at Bettiah main branch of State Bank of India was effected but its Bagaha and Narainpur branches remained open.

The bandh was by and large peaceful and effective in Nawada town while it had no impact in rural areas. Chilly weather and heavy police vigil helped the bandh to remain peaceful. Banks were closed and ATMs were also shut apprehending trouble.

At Ara, CPI-ML leaders and workers blocked the Ara-Patna, Ara-Sasaram roads and Sahar-Arwal bridge for several hours. CPI-ML town secretary Dilraj Pritam said there were blockades at almost all the blocks and markets. While Ara-Patna main road was blocked for 4 hours by the protesters led by CPI-ML central committee member Jawahar Lal Singh and Tarari MLA Sudama Prasad, Ara-Sasaram main road was blocked by party workers led by Mahesh Prasad. The Sahar-Arwal bridge blockade for over 2 hours was led by CPI-ML Sahar block secretary Upendra Bharti. Sandesh chowk, Agiyaon and Jagdishpur markets, Lohia Chowk at Piro and Kayamnagar market on the Ara-Patna main road also witnessed blockade and protests.

43,['9/01/2020'],Police foil Naidu’s attempt to hold capital shift ‘padayatra’,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Tension prevailed in the city after former chief minister and TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu along with TDP and Left party leaders attempted to conduct a padayatra from Benz Circle to Autonagar area around 7 pm on Wednesday.

Naidu, who visited Benz Circle to open the Amaravati Parirakshana Joint Action Committee office, was infuriated as city police seized the buses meant to conduct a state-wide tour in protest against the proposal to shift the capital.

Soon, he along with MLAs, MLCs and leaders from CPI and CPI(M) attempted to hold a padayatra to Autonagar where the buses were seized. Soon, deputy commissioner of police (L&O–I) Harshavaradhan reached the spot to calm things down.

Naidu refused to stop his padayatra and arguments ensued as to why the bus tour was stopped. He questioned the need to take permission for conducting a ‘mere’ bus tour with the police. Traffic came to a standstill at the city’s busiest junction as trucks, buses and even ambulance services had to take a detour till Ramavarappadu.

Later, the cops brought in an Eicher van and detained all the TDP leaders, including Naidu. However, things took more dramatic turn after the driver lost the van keys that he had kept in the vehicle while boarding the van. The vehicle was stuck near the Benz Circle Flyover for almost 30 minutes.

By that time the news of Naidu being taken into custody had created furore across Krishna and Guntur districts as stray protests began to erupt across the place.

A man attempted to immolate himself in Nandigama town as the cops intervened while party workers burnt tires at Thullur area. Finally, the cops managed to move the van from the spot by using a few other similar keys and shifted him away from the spot at around 9.30 pm.

Police sources said that they would be registering a case against Naidu for violating prohibitory orders and disrupting law and order.

44,['9/01/2020'],Monthly SIP flows boost MFs’ assets to record Rs 27.3L cr in Dec,"This story is from January 9, 2020

TNN

Mumbai: Helped by strong flows through systematic investment plans ( SIPs ) and also equity flows through lump sum routes, assets under management ( AUMs ) of the mutual fund industry touched an all-time high at Rs 27.3 lakh crore in December 2019.

The monthly SIP flow also reached an all-time high at Rs 8,518 crore, AMFI data showed, indicating investor interest for equity funds as the two benchmark indices — sensex and Nifty — scaled new peaks during the month. The previous highest monthly SIP flow was Rs 8,324 crore recorded in July 2019.

The record AUM came despite a Rs 71,160-crore outflow from liquid funds due to advance corporate tax outgo in December, which was expected, industry players said. However, net outflows from liquid and overnight funds were much less than what was recorded in September and July, probably due to the change in corporate tax rates announced on September 20, and the challenging business environment, the sources added.

Data also showed December was the 13th month on the trot that SIP flows remained above the Rs 8,000-crore level, despite all the volatility during this phase. According to AMFI chief executive N S Venkatesh, retail investors continued to repose trust in mutual funds , which was evident from the continued flows through the SIP route despite the challenging domestic economic scenario and global trade issues and conflicts.

“Markets have rallied and indices scaled new peaks, which is reflective of resolution coming through structural policies like IBC and lowering of interest rates, as also expectation from the Budget,” Venkatesh said.

Net equity flows in December jumped over threefold, boosted mainly by the rally in the stock market, and it is expected to improve if the markets remain strong “The net flow into equity funds has gone up by about 243% over the November 2019 figure. This in itself is a very positive sign, especially in conjunction with the fact that SIP flows have also increased by about 3%. The sustained rally in large-cap stocks has probably helped to build confidence among investors,” Union Mutual Fund CEO G Pradeepkumar said.

“It is also a reflection of the maturity of mutual fund investors and of the quality of sales process that the SIP flows remain robust and that there has been no large-scale redemption. As sentiments improve, we can expect the flows into equity schemes to gather further momentum,” he said.

45,['9/01/2020'],A/c numbers won’t change after Union Bank’s 3-way merger: MD,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com

Mumbai: Union Bank of India is set to double in size in a few months following the merger with Corporation Bank and Andhra Bank . The government has already infused Rs 11,700 crore into Union Bank and has indicated April 1 as a tentative date for the merger. In an interview with TOI, the bank’s MD & CEO Rajkiran Rai G speaks of how learnings from Bank of Baroda ’s amalgamation have helped save several months in implementing the merger. Excerpts:

What stage has the merger reached in terms of approvals?

We are working with a plan to compete the process as early as possible and we are working with April 1 as a tentative date. The boards of the respective banks have approved the plan. Once we get the approval from the government and the regulator, the board will decide the swap ratio and put up the same for approval with the shareholders.

Are there any preparations for the integration?

A lot. We have created a governance structure for execution. The governance structure comes from the board — a sub-committee of the board, a committee of MDs, and committee of general managers. There are 30 functional teams from the different banks looking at every product and process. There are 228 products out of 279 which have already been harmonised. Similarly, there are 179 policies of which 114 are harmonised. The functional teams have had 288 meetings. The GM committee, which approves what the functional teams have done, have met 71 times. Next, our IT teams will work on the products that will be launched on the zero date. From the customer point of view, it has been decided by the functional teams that there is no need to change the account numbers.

How will you rationalise the products? Will it be ‘best in three’?

We have decided not to go in for ‘best in three’ (of the three banks) but the ‘best in class’. Since we are already working on the products, we decided that if there are better products in the markets, we will go with them. By the third week of January, the IT teams would get into developing and rationalising the products.

What kind of integration has happened in IT?

We are in Finacle 10 (core banking system) and so is Corporation Bank. Andhra Bank is on Finacle 7, so it may take some more time. The full integration should be done in nine months. But on day 1, we will give basic services like cash withdrawal and cash deposit from all branches. We have saved at least three-four months in our amalgamation plan on the back of the learnings from the Bank of Baroda merger.

Will there be rationalisation of branches?

Fortunately for us, there is not much overlap except in some major cities. Even if we rationalise some branches in large cities, in future we will use the licence for opening more branches elsewhere. Branch network is very important for current & saving deposits and retail business. We are also thinking of moving some departments to the south. For instance, digital banking can be in Mangalore or Hyderabad. Similarly, audit and retail credit department need not be in the headquarters. Moving the departments will avoid unnecessary displacement of people. Also, we will need to expand the administrative structure to support the doubling of business that will happen after the merger. Besides having a new post of chief general managers, we will have more corporate branches, headed by general managers, in places where the merging banks are strong.

How do you plan to reposition yourself?

With three banks coming together, there is an opportunity to relook at the whole structure and position ourself as a strong digital bank. This is essential to push MSME and retail business where analytics and artificial intelligence are becoming important.

What about subsidiaries and partnerships?

In addition to our London and our mutual fund subsidiary, we will retain CorpBank Securities. There will be two life insurance joint ventures — Star Union Dai-ichi and First Life where Andhra Bank has a stake. Andhra Bank is planning to sell its stake.

Chennai: The Madras high court on Wednesday directed the secretary to Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department and the warden of M C Rajan Government Hostel in Saidapet to appear before it and explain as to why they failed to respond to the directions of the court.

The first bench of Chief Justice A P Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad passed the interim order on a plea moved by S Anantharaj alleging uninhabitable conditions in the hostel and threat to its occupants due to its dilapidated state.

On November 16, 2019, the court directed the secretary to inspect the hostel and file a report with photographs by November 28. However, when the plea was taken up for hearing on Wednesday, counsel for the petitioner informed the court that the secretary had not filed any report as directed by the court.

Recording the same, the bench said, “No response has been filed despite two directions having been given by this court. The situation sought to be remedied to this PIL is directly under the nose of the high court and is a stone’s throw away from it. It is unfortunate that the respondents have not filed any response as per directions of this court. We direct the official as well as the warden to be personally present before this court on January 20 to explain as to why they have not given any response.”

Representative image

PATNA: State police personnel have not been getting their allowances and other monetary benefits since the implementation of Comprehensive Financial Management System (CFMS) in April last year. The new system is unable to cater to their several requirements as it lacks facilities for arrears disbursal, deduction for welfare fund from monthly salary and one month’s additional pay among other things.

In view of the problem persisting for so many months, the police headquarters has convened a meeting with senior officers through videoconferencing on Thursday. A letter has been sent to finance department secretary (expenditure) on Tuesday requesting him to nominate an officer posted for handling the CFMS to attend the meeting.

In fact, this is not the first letter written to the finance department by the police headquarters on this issue. Sources said letters were sent to authorities concerned on several occasions to apprise them of the difficulties caused by the CFMS.

Even DGP Gupteshwar Pandey wrote a letter to additional chief secretary (home) in December last year, categorically describing nine major issues being faced by the state police personnel due to CFMS. Pandey pointed out that the CFMS had no facility of group withdrawal of travelling allowance, arrears, deduction of house building advance taken before year 2012.

The DGP also highlighted that the software lacked facility for deducting provident fund amount of those employees who were working on contract. It also lacks facility to show annual salary details, option for 13 months’ salary and few other things.

In that letter, DGP apprehended that if timely solution is not found, the state police may have to surrender crores of rupees provided under the head of travelling allowance (TA) as the last quarter of the financial year will end in March.

Pandey mentioned that districts were allocated Rs128.95 crore under the head of TA, but only Rs36.76 crore could be disbursed and police personnel and officers were travelling on private expenses.

Bihar Police Men’s Association president Narendra Kumar Dheeraj told TOI that the TA disbursal issue was resolved hardly ten days back after the DGP’s letter. “Police headquarters has written several letters to the authorities concerned on the matter but problems persist. Salary payment for March and April last year was delayed due to this new software. Those paying EMIs were fined by banks and wards of several policemen could not deposit their fees on time,” he said, adding a month’s additional payable salary to policemen for 2018 was still pending in few districts.

Dheeraj also said there is a provision of annual payment of Rs6,000 by the association to the widows of police personnel who died while in service. “This may stop if deduction of Rs150 per month from everyone’s salary does not restart. The deduction stopped since the new software was introduced last year. It also doesn’t have the facility to deduct monthly amount from salary for payment to estranged wife on the court’s order,” he said.

Bihar Police Association president Mrityunjay Kumar Singh said Rs36,000 to maximum two wards of every officer is provided for higher studies after matriculation from the Rs150 monthly deduction for education, welfare and medical assistance. “Rs5,000 to Rs50,000 is provided in at least 25 different kinds of illness. Besides, Rs10 is deducted separately from the monthly salary of every cop from the rank of constable to inspector for their respective associations. All these are not taking place since the new software was introduced,” Singh said, adding that new software also prevents them from making mass deduction from everyone’s salary to donate for any cause as per wish.

He said the police association will enter its centenary year on May 20 this year. “But we are facing financial crunch to run this association as money is not getting deducted for the fund,” he said.

PATNA: Makeshift shops, selling colourful kites of all shapes and sizes, have come up across the city in view of Makar Sankranti celebrations next week. The harvest festival, which marks the arrival of spring, is synonymous to the practice of flying kites.

Everyone — from kids and youngsters to adults and elderly people — follows the tradition with utmost fervour. Hence, all types of kites are being sold in the city.

Some sellers claimed that kites with cartoon characters like Doraemon , Shin Chan and Chhota Bheem were in high demand. “I do not have plain kites because children, who visit my shop, buy ones with their favourite cartoon characters printed on them,” Shankar Gupta, a kite seller in Bakarganj, told this newspaper.

Another seller, Pankaj, said, “Kites are available in the range of Rs 3 to Rs 30 per piece. While a plain paper kite is priced at Rs 3, a fancy one is sold at Rs 30.”

Since kites are cheap, many people usually buy a large number of them before Makar Sankranti. Mahesh Shrivastava, a kite dealer in Boring Road area, claimed, “Kites are delicate and can be torn easily if not handled with care. Hence, kite lovers prefer buying approximately 100 pieces at a time.”

Meanwhile, Patnaites are excited to participate in kite-flying competitions on Makar Sankranti. “My friends and I organize a contest every year where we fly kites and eat lots of ‘tilkuts’ and sweets,” Saguna Mor resident Amit Sinha said.

To Aastha Kanika, a resident of Boring Canal Road, kite-flying is an age-old tradition, which should be kept alive.

There are some, who make their own kites, instead of buying one. “I have ordered bamboo sticks and thin, colourful sheets from an online store so that I can make kites at home,” said Sheila Tiwari, a kite enthusiast.

MUZAFFARPUR: Muzaffarpur police arrested five impersonators while they were trying to extort money from a truck driver and others by posing themselves as police officials near Kachchi-Pakki Chowk under the Sadar police station area of the town here on Wednesday.

Police chased the impersonators for nearly 5km to nab them while they were trying to flee towards Motihari by hijacking the truck which was loaded with cattle.

“The impersonators posing as DSP and other police officers first demanded extortion from the driver, failing which, they got inside the truck and asked the driver to take it to the nearby police station. Later, the truck driver saw that next police station passed and the impersonators kept asking them to drive. After a while, the driver saw a police patrolling vehicle and raised an alarm for help, following which the police team chased the truck for around 5km and nabbed the impersonators,” Sadar police station SHO Mithilesh Kumar Jha said.

He added that all arrested persons were being quizzed. “They have revealed some vital information about their gang and modus operandi. The rest of the gang members will be arrested soon,” said SP (city) P K Mandal, adding that further investigation is on after lodging an FIR based on the statement of the driver under various sections of IPC related to kidnapping, loot and impersonating their identities to extort money.

Meanwhile, the driver of the truck, Md Khalil told police that he was going to Samastipur . “As soon as we reached near Kachchi-Pakki Chowk, some men, dressed in police uniform stopped us on the pretext of vehicle-checking drive. I produced all the documents related to the truck and my driving license. Later, they threatened to seize our truck claiming that the vehicle is loaded with illegal cattle. They also asked us to pay Rs 5 lakh fine for letting us go without any hassle. When I refused to pay the money, they took us on gun-point and asked me to drive the vehicle to the nearby police station,” he said.

Representative image

PATNA: The two recent incidents of rape in the state capital have created fear in the minds of young girls and women, who are worried about their safety. Though the main accused in the Monday rape case surrendered in a city court on Wednesday and two others had been arrested on Tuesday, the girl students, particularly those residing in private hostels and return from coaching centres late in the evening, expressed concern over the police functioning in the city as the BBA student was kidnapped in a car from the busy Boring Road roundabout in the evening hours and subsequently gang-raped in a flat at Patliputra Colony.

Another city college student was gang-raped in Nehru Nagar area of the city on December 9 last year. The case had triggered protests and debates over women safety in the state capital, but failed to wake up the police.

Several girls complained that they were often subjected to sexual harassment near the college campus or on roads. Many girls did not register their complaints due to societal pressure and fear of social stigma.

A BCA IInd year student of Shri Arvind Mahila College, on the condition of anonymity, said the incidents of sexual harassment are rampant near the college premises. “Several girls did not complain about the incidents due to stigma. They are also scared that their parents would not support their studies and ask them to stay at home,” she said.

In a unique initiative, the girl’s schools and colleges have been instructed to put a DGP box on their campuses for women’s safety on the instruction of Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey. These complaint boxes are opened by the SHO of Mahila police station once in a couple of months. In addition to this, police constables were also deployed at several girl’s educational institutes.

According to sources, the initiative failed to attract complainants due to delay in opening of complaint boxes. Magadh Mahila College principal Shashi Sharma told this newspaper that earlier it was decided that the DGP box would be opened in 15 days. However, it was not followed. “Why should students endure eve-teasing for so long after submitting their complaint?” she asked.

“Even the police constables deployed near college premises are not active and keep busy playing games on their mobile phones. They do their duty only from 10.30am to 3.30pm. Even though the college hours are between 7am and 4.30pm,” she added.

Bihar State Women Commission’s chairman Dilmani Mishra blamed the casual attitude of police constables to address the women’s issue. “The police need to take strict action against the culprits of gang rape of the BBA student in Patna . Speedy trial should take place in this matter as well as other woman-related cases of rape and harassment,” she told this newspaper.

Mahila police station SHO Arti Kumari Jaiswal told this newspaper that due to staff crunch and engagement in investigation of woman-related cases, they are unable to monitor the complaints in the DGP boxes. “The staff crunch problem has been sorted out and from now on, we will open the complaint boxes twice a month,” she said.

CHENNAI: The escalating US-Iran conflict , after ballistic missiles were launched early on Wednesday, fired up global gold prices by 2% to $1,611 — a 7-year-high. “Gold prices closed higher overnight. Today, in early morning trade, gold prices crossed $1,600 per ounce for the first time in nearly seven years as investors flocked to safe havens assets,” said Yes Bank chief economist Shubhada Rao.Domestic prices went up to Rs 42,860 in Chennai for 10 grams of 24 carats, a record high. Other cities saw prices hover around Rs 41,000 (see graphic). Prices are up by 5.5% in the first few days of this calendar year and nearly 25% in the current fiscal. Other precious metals such as palladium hit a fresh all-time peak of $2,056 an ounce and silver prices touched a three-month high of $18.6 per ounce. Domestic silver prices stood at Rs 48,875 per kg.The domestic prices rose by Rs 450 in one day for 10 grams and by Rs 2,000 over 10 days. The falling rupee (at Rs 71.71 per dollar as of Wednesday’s close) further pushed up domestic prices as India imports most of its gold and a weaker rupee means spending more for the same quantity of gold.Motilal Oswal associate director and head (commodity) Kishore Narne said that domestic spot prices could go up to as much as Rs 44,500 on the back of global developments.“But such prices have restricted purchases to buying merely for essential occasions such as weddings. Jewellers are not stocking up either and there is a significant drop in imports from India,” he said.Gold prices began rising last June because of the rate cut by the US Fed, and geopolitical crises such as the US-China trade war, Argentina’s currency crisis and protests in Hong Kong as well. Consequentially, demand fell by 30% in India starting from the July-September quarter of FY19 and the industry, which pinned its hopes on the festival and wedding season, is staring at uncertainty with escalating prices. The demand may not look up any time soon as analysts predict gold prices would rally until the US-Iran crisis persists. Other events, including US internal policy changes and Brexit , could also push prices up. “In the US, monthly non-farm payroll data will be released on Friday, which could give further direction to gold prices. The US Federal Reserve will also take cues from MNP data to decide the policy path in 2020,” said Abhishek Bansal, chairman of ABans group of companies.“Continued Fed intervention in the repo market could mean gold price performance will be impacted by uncertainty around monetary policy direction. Brexit would also push gold performance,” said World Gold Council in a report.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73166215,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-197683,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gold-hits-record-rs-42k-global-rates-shine-to-7-year-high/articleshow/73163081.cms

KOLKATA: It’s almost 12.30am on a winter night, but more than 150 women sat in Park Circus Maidan, chanting slogans of ‘Azaadi’ even as a huge crowd of men stood in a circle around.Drawing inspiration from Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, these women left their homes and gathered in the open to oppose NRC, CAA, NPR. The pillars of the movement, tagged ‘Kolkata’s Shaheen Bagh’, are mothers and grandmothers, mostly homemakers and first-time protesters, who, scared for the future of their children, have decided to stay put at Park Circus Maidan till the new citizenship law is revoked. “What will we answer when the future generations will ask us how could we let our country be destroyed in the name of religion?” said Shahina Hussain, who has stepped out to condemn the JNU attack and oppose NRC,CAA and NPR. “Students are being beaten up on campuses, which are considered to be safe places. I have a daughter and if I don’t protest now, she could be the next target.” Asked who is taking care of her household, she said her husband was managing home, while made efforts to reclaim peace in life.More women joined the protest on Wednesday, pushing up the number to 500. Holding placards and posters of Ambedkar, Gandhi and Bhagat Singh, the women sat, sloganeering while the men brought them food, tea, quilt and warm clothes, and ensured no unwanted person tried to disrupt the peaceful demonstration.Asmat Jamil, a kidney-transplant patient, who took the initiative to organize the protest, said, “The women assembled here are all homemakers and it is their fight for their rights. It is not possible for them to attend rallies at different hours and so, they have chosen this place for a peaceful demonstration. It will go on till government revokes this act.”Age seemed to be merely a number as 72-year-old Qaisar Hasan and 80-year-old Nurjahan Shakil took a lead in the protest with as much zest as the younger members. “I am here to save the social fabric of my country, my land, my home. This law will divide people in the name of religion and we will not let it happen. We have a past of living together with love and harmony and it is for the future of our children and country that I have hit the streets,” said Shakil.Benazir Hussain could not leave behind her one-and-a-half-year old son home. So, she brought Zohann along when she joined the protest on Tuesday night. “My son is not well and breastfeeding here is a little problem but I am managing. It is better to sit here and protest, instead of going to detention centres.” Like Benazir, Nazma Khatun has come with her son, Nabeel, and Tabassum with her 14-month-old daughter, Ayaat. Both the mothers had been up the entire night and said they were not going anywhere. Shagufta Yasmin (20), who has brought along her eight-month-old child, said, “We are all Indians and why do we need to prove it? Let the government prove we don’t belong. Hum kagaj nahi dikhayenge.”Kolkata’s Shaheen Bagh has turned into a community by itself, with people from all faiths and ages came together out to defend the Constitution. Presidency University student Aryan Agrahari has taught the kids, Hamza and Kashaf, the ‘Azaadi’ slogan. When the elders are getting exhausted, children like them are taking over. Feminist social activist Dolon Ganguly said the Muslim women coming out on the streets was a huge step forward. They sent out a message of secularism, she said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73167496,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-242089,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/elders-mothers-fight-for-rights-at-kolkatas-shaheen-bagh/articleshow/73163600.cms
55,['9/01/2020'],‘SSNNL is liable for crop loss caused by unmaintained canals’,"This story is from January 9, 2020

SSNL is liable to pay damages to farmer for crop loss due to non-maintenance of its canals

AHMEDABAD: The Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNL) is liable for damages to farmers, if the lack of maintenance of its canals causes trouble for farmers and results in crop loss. The consumer court held so and ordered SSNNL to pay compensation to a Bharuch farmer for losses he suffered following a breach of a minor canal near his field.

The case involves Kirit Patel of Sarbhan village in Bharuch district . A minor canal of the Narmada project flows near his one-hectare field. He was a member of the Sarbhan Minor Narmada Irrigation Co-operative Society Ltd, which draws water from the canal. In return, each farmer pays Rs 330 per hectare per year for Narmada water irrigation.

Patel complained to the Bharuch District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum in 2009 that due to breaches in the canal and it overflowing, his fields remained inundated, resulting in loss of crops for nearly two years – 2007-08 and 2008-09. The SSNL and local authorities did not maintain the canal and due to its poor construction, the leak continued. He claimed that he faced a loss of Rs 1 to Rs 1.5 lakh every year due to waterlogging.

The forum computed the loss and in 2011 ordered SSNNL and its local office to pay damages to the farmer. SSNNL challenged the compensation order before the Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission saying it is not a profit-making business body but aims to benefit farmers with its various irrigation schemes. Hence, it cannot be asked to pay damages to the farmer as its consumer. The SSNNL also argued that the farmer was drawing water in an unauthorized manner. The water is supplied to water users’ associations either without charge or at subsidised rates. It requested the commission to quash the forum’s order.

After hearing the case, the consumer commission concluded that since the farmer was paying water charges to the SSNNL, there was a consumer-service provider relationship. Hence, SSNL is liable to pay damages to farmer for crop loss due to non-maintenance of its canals.

SURAT: Sarthana police booked five persons on Tuesday for allegedly cheating the regional transport office (RTO) of Rs 19.66 lakh in taxes . One accused has been arrested by police on Wednesday.

Police arrested Rajendra alias Rajesh Vasvala, a resident of Kamrej, and booked four others Rajesh Vekariya, Vinod Bharwad , Vipul Gothaliya and Kirit Vyas based on complaint lodged by P D Vanda, police sub inspector of Varachha police station after preliminary investigation. The accused were booked for cheating, criminal breach of trust and other sections under Indian Penal Code.

Around two months ago cops came to know about a bus that was plying daily between Surat and parts of Saurashtra on forged registration number.

They seized the bus and got its chassis number examined forensically and found that the numbers of both chassis as well as engine have been tampered. Later police checked RTO records and found that the accused were using the registration number of a bus already scrapped.

“The original number of the bus was GJ-05-AU-9300 which had tax dues amounting to Rs 19.66 lakh, As such they were using the scrapped vehicle’s registration number as it had no tax dues,” said C K Patel, assistant commissioner of police, A division.

Investigation so far revealed that the bus originally belonged to a travel operator who sold it to Bharwad in 2017. The bus was later sold multiple times to the other accused. During the multiple dealings, they changed the chassis, engine and registration number plate of the bus to hide its original identity and evade paying the tax.

58,['9/01/2020'],Trolls go whole hog to muzzle voices in season of protest,"This story is from January 9, 2020

KOLKATA: Minutes after Deepika Padukone’s visit to the JNU campus to show solidarity with the students, social media was polarised with trends ranging from #ISupportDeepika to #BoycottChhapaak. While many praised her guts and quiet grace, trolls questioned her silence on campus, support for the ‘tukde-tukde gang’, alleged lack of knowledge about the issue and supposed indulgence in publicity.

In this season of protests, the actor is among many who have faced the wrath of trolls, their tone vicious and language derogatory. From raising doubts about their target’s intellect to lack of patriotism — trolls are leaving no stone unturned in pelting invisible hate bombs at anyone with contrarian views. In extreme cases, there have been reports of rape threats too.

To counter these critics, a city-based academic has changed the privacy settings of her Facebook profile and limited it to comments by her friends alone. “That has helped reduce random trolls from abusing me on Facebook. Of course, at times it’s a Facebook ‘friend’ who starts to troll you viciously and I have been surprised like this quite a few times,” she said, remembering how phrases like ‘anti-national’ and ‘naxal’ were randomly thrown at her by a Facebook friend for criticising the central government.

“Referring to my being a professor, this friend even described me as a ‘less than mediocre parasite who wastes taxpayers’ money’. Many people have come out in this fashion, particularly after NRC-CAA. At this point, there’s no option but to block them,” she said, refusing to disclose her identity to protect herself.

Visvak, an Indian student who went to London’s SOAS University on scholarship a few months back, is wary of being victimised for being vocal about his criticism of CAA-NRC on social media. From being called a “Maoist, sickular Pakistani” to a “member of the tukde-tukde gang”, Visvak has heard it all on Twitter. “I also know of girls who speak up but don’t use their profile photos and real names for fear of being identified by trolls. I do not engage with trolls. I block them or report them if they are abusive,” he told TOI.

However, not everyone can deal with barbs smartly. Some even land up in psychiatrists’ chambers for counselling after being trolled. Psychiatrist Sabyasachi Mitra told TOI that most cases of “e-abuse” involve girls. “E-abuse is in sync with the new world order. It is similar to physical abuse and generates the same consequences without the effect of violence. Victims slip to depression, anxiety and have post-traumatic stress disorder-like symptoms. Some even retreat into shells and the consequences can be similar to self-harm thoughts,” Mitra said, adding that he recommends supportive counselling, training in anxiety management and cognitive behavioural therapy for such patients.

On Tuesday, psychiatrist Jairanjan Ram had a youngster at his clinic who was crestfallen because the troll — an uncle — had accused her of making “ill-informed comments” like a “fool”.

However, Ram had a word of caution for anyone posting a strong statement on social media. The person, he said, must have the mental strength of a batsman entering a stadium to face the fastest bowler without a helmet.

“In the last four-five months, I have been seeing a rise in such cases at my clinic. In 15 days, I get to see two such cases,” he said, adding, “The moment you make a strong point, there will be people who will jump at you. It is for you to decide how far you want to take the argument. But always remember that you have to respect a person’s radical views and agree to disagree.”

The project will be implemented on 78% of the SMC and 22% of SUDA land

SURAT: The implementation of Rs 3 ,904 crore Tapi Riverfront development project will be taken up by forming a different special purpose vehicle (SPV) with a 13-member board.

Eight of the SPV members will be office bearers of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). The project will be implemented on 78% of the SMC and 22% of Surat Urban Development Authority (SUDA) land. The SPV will be mostly formed on the lines of Sabarmati Riverfront development project.

Following the state government’s instruction, a proposal is being prepared for the development of 66 km of space — 33 km on each side of the river from Kamrej to Rundh (Proposed barrage) — for the approval of SMC standing committee.

Once the standing committee and the general board of the SMC approve the project, the ball will start rolling with a mode of finance and acquisition of land for the project.

SMC city engineer Jatin Desai told TOI: “Majority of this land is owned by different government departments and the SMC, so it will not be time consuming. Boundaries of the development are not fixed as it will based on land availability and existing development on both shores.”

The project is considered as a dream project for Surat city as it will open a whole new possibility of water transport route along with the formation of an additional reservoir for the storage of fresh water apart from number of other recreational and commercial activities. Amusement park, gardens and the development of religious places in the first phase of the project from existing, weir-cum-causeway at Singapore to proposed barrage at Rundh in downstream of Tapi, will also take place.

The SPV will include municipal commissioner, mayor, deputy mayor, standing chairman, city engineer, the SMC deputy commissioner, in -charge of road and development, the SMC deputy commissioner, finance, one independent member nominated by the mayor apart from the collector, SUDA chairman and irrigation department superintendent engineer. Chairman of the SSPV will be the government nominated director and MD will be municipal commissioner.

SMC commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani said, “As a preliminary activity to the riverfront project, we have started an exercise to block all the black and grey water going into Tapi on the whole stretch. We will complete the project to remove all outlets that dispose polluted water on Tapi riverbed and be ready for Tapi riverfront implementation.”

RAJKOT: Four fishermen were injured in a fierce mid-sea clash between two groups off Mangrol coast in Junagadh district on Tuesday night.

The groups of fishermen crossed over into each other’s boats and launched attacks with bats, iron pipes and knives. However, they struck a comprise on Wednesday and desisted from filing police complaints.

According to the details of the incident, one group belonging to Kharwa community and the other belonging to Muslim community had gone fishing off Mangrol coast on Tuesday.

“The clash erupted between the groups when a member of one group navigated his boat through the spot where the other group had already laid its fishing net ,” said B K Vagh, sub-inspector with Mangrol marine police station.

“Though four persons were injured, the victims did not register any complaint. Traditionally, they first take permission from their group leaders before approaching the police. Their leaders asked them to strike truce,” explained Vagh.

Velji Masani , leader of the Kharwa community in Mangrol, “We have asked the members of both the groups to give compensation to those who suffered losses in the incident which they have agreed.”

Amartya Sen

KOLKATA: Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen on Wednesday said the CAA “should be scrapped and the Supreme Court should turn it down on grounds of it being unconstitutional”. Sen, who reached Kolkata on Wednesday night and headed for his Santiniketan home, also reacted to the JNU vandalism, saying, “The big absence of justice in this matter is very conspicuous.”

Speaking to a Bengali news channel outside the airport, Sen said, “To give one citizenship based on religion is against the Constitution. The law is in conflict with the Constitution. It’s the job of the Supreme Court to see whether what was passed in Parliament can be legally attached to the Constitution.”

Speaking about the JNU attack, Sen said, “Some outsiders tortured the students and indulged in lawlessness. Police have failed to nab anybody till date and I heard the CCTV cameras weren’t working. I also heard that an FIR was lodged against those who got beaten up.”

Sayantan Basu, BJP state general secretary, said, “We have nothing to say if Sen reacts to the role of Delhi cops. But we expect him to be equally vocal when lawmakers like Swapan Dasgupta and Babul Supriyo are harassed on university campuses.”

Representative image

AGRA: The Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) administration is going to levy a tax on residents keeping pet dogs. During the municipal house session on Wednesday, Mayor Naveen Jain directed the civic body officials to start the work in this regard. The idea was put forward by councillor Ravi Sharma.

“Keeping a pet dog is not a necessity. It is a type of luxury. Owners of pet dogs take them out for a walk on streets and parks where they defecate and hamper sanitation and hygiene. Sanitation workers make efforts to keep the surroundings clean and healthy. Therefore, municipal corporation must charge at least Rs 1,000 per annum from the pet owners,” Sharma said.

According to the estimate made by Sharma, there are around 10,000 residents who keep a pet dog in 100 wards of the city. Charging Rs 1,000 per annum from each pet owner will result in earning Rs 1 crore. The funds can be used in improving the state of cleanliness in the city.

A senior civic body official said, “There is a provision to levy tax on owners of pet animals under the Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. However, in Uttar Pradesh , no tax has ever been imposed on pet dogs in the past. A policy is required to be developed in this regard. Every pet owner will have to apply for the licence and procure an anti-rabies vaccination certificate. The process will be started in the next financial year.”

Kolkata: Thespian Soumitra Chatterjee, author Sankha Ghosh and director Tarum Mazumder were among the signatories who have extended their support towards the JNU students who were attacked by masked thugs on campus.

In a statement released on Wednesday, the veterans mentioned their inability to be physically present beside the students. “Our hearts are with them. We are convinced that they will win the battle,” read the statement that was shared on social media by Chatterjee’s daughter Poulami Bose.

The intellectuals mentioned they were at a loss for words to condemn the atrocities on students. “In contemporary times, JNU is one of the premium institutions.... Despite knowing the identity of the goons who indulged in the planned attacks on campus, not one of them has been arrested by Amit Shah’s police. Such an incident is a big scar on the democratic history of our country,” the statement said. It also mentioned that the signatories believe they notice a “conspiracy” to destroy the future by taking away the right of students to think about the well-being of the nation and society. The statement was also signed by Koushik Sen, Badsha Maitra, Anjan Dutta, Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Samik Banerjee, Buddhadeb Dasgupta and Bidipta Chakraborty, among others.

TIRUPUR: Most of the commercial establishments and apparel units remained closed in the city on Wednesday in support of the nationwide bandh called by trade unions. Normal life took a hit due to the bandh.

Police detained 600 protesters, who gathered in front of the Tirupur railway station, and released them in the evening. Earlier, police had diverted traffic for two-and-half hours in order to facilitate the stir on the stretch. Apparel industrial sources said business transactions worth several crores have been lost in the day. Even most of the medical shops on arterial roads were shut in support of the protest.

The nationwide strike was called by trade unions including CITU, AITUC, LPF, MLF and HMS, urging the Centre to protect the weakened MSMEs sector and automobile industry, to give up plans to privatize public sector undertakings including Indian railways and to control inflation.

CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan, who took part in the protest here, said wrongful economic policies of the central government had squeezed MSMEs sector including the Tirupur apparel cluster, increased unemployment and inflation. “Moreover, the Centre has brought amendments in labour laws which deny various rights to employees. While people are suffering due to poverty in the country, the Centre has brought the Citizenship Amendment Act, which is against the constitution.”

“So, people, especially government and private employees, have supported the nationwide protest,” he added.

Representative image

SASARAM: At least 725 fully grown trees have been identified to be felled for widening of the GT Road that criss-crosses through the Sasaram town.

The foundation stone for the road widening project was laid on December 17. According to sources, the state road construction department (RCD), after completing necessary formalities at its end, has sent a proposal in this regard to Rohtas divisional forest officer (DFO) and sought his approval to cut down the identified trees.

The 5.28km-long GT Road stretch, which passes through the municipal area of Sasaram, has to be widened under the supervision of RCD’s Kochas division executive engineer Sanjay Kumar. “We conducted a survey and found that around 725 trees on both flanks of the road are coming under the alignment of the widened section of the road,” Sanjay said.

He added that a nod from the DFO will pave way for the road widening work entailing an estimated outlay of Rs 43 crore.

Asked about a notification of state environment, forest and climate change department dated July 26, 2019, which prohibits cutting of trees on government land for any project, the RCD executive engineer said the notification is not applicable to this project since it has already got the approval of the state government. “This approval was given in 2018,” he said.

Rohtas DFO P Gaurav told this newspaper that he had certain queries and the approval to fell the trees will be given only after he gets proper answer to the queries.

“Our department had earlier turned down a request from the RCD seeking permission to cut 7,000 trees for widening the Nasarigaj-Dehri road. We have asked the RCD to workout a plan so that less number of trees are required to be felled,” Gaurav said and added that as per the July notification, environment protection measures like translocation of trees and plantation of twice the number of trees cut would have to be taken into account while cutting down the existing trees.

BUXAR/PATNA: A week after the death of two life convicts serving life term in Buxar Central Jail under mysterious circumstances, a high-level team of the prison directorate visited the jail to inquire into the incident.

Sources said that a team of officials led by deputy director (prison) Prashant Kumar Srivastava visited the jail on Tuesday and inquired about the cause of death of the two inmates. One of the two deceased, Suresh Kumhar (30), a resident of Nainijore village in Buxar district had died during treatment at Buxar sadar hospital. Another inmate Master Bind (80) was declared brought dead by the doctors after being referred from the jail hospital on January 1.

A senior jail official said the probe team also discussed the issue pertaining to the inmate’s death with the doctors posted in the prison hospital.

PATNA: With Makar Sankranti around the corner, city shops have started selling ‘tilkuts’, ‘til papdis’, rolls, ‘gajaks’ and ‘laddoos’. Different varieties of the sweet sesame wafers are available, but those made of sugar and jaggery are the most popular among Patnaites.

While sugar and jaggery ‘tilkuts’ are priced at Rs 300 and Rs 240 per kg, the sugar-free variants are being sold at Rs 400. Besides, ‘khoya’ and chocolate ‘tilkuts’ are available for Rs 450 and Rs 500 per kg.

Also known as ‘Til Sakrat’, ‘tilkut’ is an important part of Makar Sankranti. City-based priest Upendra Nath told this newspaper, “Offering black and white sesame sweets to God can bring prosperity and good luck. People also offer ‘tilkuts’ along with curd and flattened rice to priests and the poor.

Numerous makeshift shops have been set up in every nook and cranny of the city for selling ‘tilkuts’. “Every year, I set up a stall almost a fortnight before Makar Sankranti. People start buying ‘tilkuts’ from the last week of December,” said Rajiv Kumar, the owner of a shop on Gola Road.

Several shops have also hired ‘tilkut’ makers from other cities. Ravi Gupta, the owner of a prominent sweet store in Kadamkuan, said, “I have been hiring ‘tilkut’ makers from Gaya for the last 20 years.”

Shopkeepers claimed that ‘khoya tilkuts’ were in high demand. “They have always been the customers’ favourite. ‘Khoya’, being a milk product, cannot be stored for a long time. Hence, I make sure that these ‘tilkuts’ are sold within two-three days,” said Nirmal, the owner of a ‘tilkut’ shop on Gola Road.

Some hotels and restaurants have also introduced sesame sweets in their menu. “We will offer ‘til laddoo’, ‘gajak’ and other sweets from January 10 to 18,” said Keshav Shrivastava, the manager of a hotel on Boring Road.

Meanwhile, Patnaites have started purchasing ‘tilkuts’ for themselves and their relatives. “All my family members love ‘tilkuts’. Many sweet shops sell them in colourful boxes, which can be gifted to others,” said Pritee Prasad, a resident of Kadamkuan.

GAYA: About 1,700 teaching and non-teaching staff of Magadh University (MU) headquarters, 19 constituent and one deficit grant minority college will be getting their salary for the month of January in the revised pay scale as per the recommendations of the Seventh Pay commission.

Though eligible for the revised scale from January 2016, the scale was not being paid to more than 20,000 teaching and non-teaching employees of the universities in the state including MU. On an average, each employee is estimated to get a hike of around 20% in gross emoluments. Sources said that the salary difference accruing to employees for January 2016 to December 2019 will be paid later.

MU registrar Prof Sidnath Prasad Deen said that he discussed the issue of revised pay scale with senior officials of the education department on Tuesday.

“Rekha Singh, director of higher education, will hold a meeting in the third week of this month to review the financial requirements of the university in view of the implementation of the new pay scale. After the review meet, the payment-related formalities will be completed well in time to ensure disbursement of January’s salary in the enhanced scale,” the registrar said.

On the issue of students union election, the registrar said that a committee has been constituted to work out the modalities of the union elections.

Asked whether the office bearers of the central union of the university would be directly elected or college-level representatives would elect the central union office bearers, the registrar said a final decision on the election mode would be taken after considering the report of the committee constituted for the purpose. “The committee is expected to submit its report within a week,” the registrar said.

He added that recommendation would be made to the state government for grant or extension of affiliation to colleges located in five districts of Magadh division . Reminded about the legal provision regarding the university senate making the recommendation, the registrar said that once approved by the syndicate, the recommendations would be forwarded to the state government in anticipation of the senate’s approval.

The annual meet of the university senate is likely to be held in February to approve the university budget and other academic and administrative issues placed before the apex body.

PATNA: The East Central Railway (ECR) has approved the proposal of Danapur division to increase the speed limit of all mail and express trains up to 130 kmph on the Jhajha-Patna Junction-Pt Deendayal Upadhaya Junction mainline section from April 30. The Railway Board has given its nod to the proposal. At present all mail and express trains, including Rajdhani Express, are running at the speed limit of 110 kmph between Jhajha and Pt Deendayal Upadhaya Junction route.

ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar told this newspaper on Wednesday that railways is prepared to enhance the speed limit of trains up to 130 kmph on this particular route after successful completion of advanced signalling work. “Railways has also carried out track renewal work required to increase the speed limit from 110 kmph to 130 kmph. Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches are capable of running at the maximum speed limit of 130 kmph,” he said.

Kumar said track renewal work on the Jhajha-Patna — Pt Deendayal Upadhaya Junction route was significant as it replaced the 52kg tracks by those of 60kg with the length of each track to be about 130 metres. “It has already been declared as ‘Rajdhani Route’ by the Railway Board,” he said.

The CPRO said an increase in the speed limit is likely to reduce the journey hours at least by 30 minutes on the Patna-Delhi route in particular. “It would also help railways clear huge traffic rush on the Jhajha-Patna-Pt Deendayal Upadhaya Junction route. The division is presently coping with the operational needs of about 280 pairs of passenger trains. Thus, an increase in the speed limit up to 130 kmph will prove to be a boon for passengers as well,” he said.

Besides, railways has also increased the speed limit from 50 kmph to 100 kmph on Dauram Madhepura-Murliganj section under Samastipur division and from 60 kmph to 100 kmph on the Banmankhi-Purnia section followed by Dhanbad-Gaya-Pt Deendayal Upadhaya Junction from 110 kmph to 120 kmph, on Barauni-Katihar route from 70 kmph to 100 kmph, on Mohiuddinnagar-Bachwara route from 75 kmph to 90 kmph, on Raxaul-Chauradano route from 50 kmph to 80 kmph and Kursela-Karagola route from 70 kmph to 100 kmphccix:command value=""252,1""/>According to sources, railways has already increased the speed limit up to 130 kmph from Pt Deendayal Upadhaya Junction- Allahabad-Kanpur onwards to New Delhi. Increase in the speed limit has thus become a must for railways to maintain a uniform speed limit of 130 kmph right from Howrah to Delhi via Patna, Pt Deendayal Upadhaya Junction, Allahabad and Kanpur for the fast movement of mail and express trains.

Carrying placards that condemned “atrocities” and “coercion” on campuses, students from different classes and departments — shouting slogans, like “hum leke rahenge azadi” and “makkaro sun lo … azadi” — said they feared oppression was coming close to home.

At least 300 students gathered outside the first gate of the campus after they were reportedly denied permission to hold the protest meeting on campus. They said that for the past few days they had been trying to reason with the institute authorities to allow them to protest on the institute premises, which had delayed the agitation. They, however, insisted on anonymity. “We will not be surprised if we are singled out and attacked,” a girl said.

Justice Gautam Patel had permitted Tata Capital to sell the equipment at 50 locations all over India from January 8, if by then the gym chain failed to come up with a solution to settle its dues. The non-banking financial company (NBFC) had moved the high court last year in a dispute over dues worth Rs 36 crore in lease agreements for gym equipment.

The Talwalkars chain had appealed Justice Patel’s order. The appeal was heard on Wednesday by a division bench of Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice Bharati Dangre where Tata counsel Biren Saraf argued that since no solution was provided for payment, the company be permitted to take possession of the gym equipment and sell them. Tata Capital Financial Services said it had given finance to enable Talwalkars to take gym equipment on lease. The agreements are in existence since June 2014.

Saraf and law firm Manilal Kher Ambalal for the NBFC said their client was the owner of the equipment and, for the default on the rent amount for their lease, the Tata company was entitled to repossess and sell them since otherwise they would get rusted.

Talwalkars’ counsel Ashish Kamat had earlier said 40 of the 90-odd outlets are shut for want of payment of rent to landlords for the premises. The HC had last year also appointed a receiver for all the equipment plant and machinery, and noted that it is an admitted position that Talwarkars Healthclubs is facing financial difficulties. It had also noted that it was “ even now attempting to resolve with its other creditors”.

KOLKATA: A day after the Kolkata Police assured action against an accused who allegedly issued rape and death threats to a Jadavpur University student, the police have assured every netizen in the city that they can lodge complaints against such threats by contacting the local police stations or the cyber cell with adequate evidence in the form of screenshots. The cops said that depending on the nature of the crime, the legal team will mull the legal steps that can be initiated.

The cyber cell has, meanwhile, contacted the victim — a 25-year-old woman — and asked her to write out a detailed complaint. “We have asked her to follow the legal procedure. An initial probe into who has threatened her has also been launched,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar.

DC (cyber) Aparajita Rai told TOI that they have a standard operating procedure (SOP) of dealing with such cases where each case is taken up for legal vetting and counselling is offered to the victim on future steps. “Once we get the initial complaint through email, we forward it to either Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter or Instagram authorities, marking out the exact complaint. It usually takes some time for them to respond. This is the time when we launch an initial inquiry. Not all cases can be clubbed under the Information Technology Act. So, based on a written and signed statement — it is compulsory under CrPC — we slap charges under either IT Act or IPC,” an officer said.

“Some women might want the harassment to stop immediately. For these cases, we even try non-technical methods of policing to locate the culprit. If required, we get a psychiatric assessment of the accused and follow it up with counselling. In serious cases of threats — often repeated over a few days — we carry out a direct arrest. But for all such cases, the initial inquiry is vital to fix responsibilities and gauge the seriousness of the complaint,” said an officer.

The film studies student who is a known face in the anti-CAA movement and played a crucial role during the protest at Sulekha on Monday has now claimed she received rape and murder threats on social media.

78,['9/01/2020'],"Tirupur: After 53 years, first water scheme of Tirupur corporation bids adieu","This story is from January 9, 2020

TIRUPUR: After serving for 53 years, the first water scheme of Tirupur corporation has come to an end. Though the closing down of the scheme was part of implementing fourth water scheme of the corporation, it has been done at least two years before possibly the new water scheme could come into existence.

The first water scheme was not only catering to the needs of the residents in couple of wards in the corporation in southern side of the city but also serving many common water taps in the corporation limits and in other civic bodies including Karuvalur, Nambiyampalayam, Avinashi, and Thirumuruganpoondi.

The 4.7-MLD scheme was implemented in 1967 when Tirupur was facing severe water crisis. The water was taken from Bhavani river in Mettupalayam of Coimbatore district for the scheme. With the pipeline laid for around 55km, people in civic bodies from Karuvalur to Thirumuruganpoondi demanded to erect common water taps for their use. So, the Tamil Water Supply and Drainage (Twad) board, the implementing agency, had obliged and erected the common water taps.

More than 10 such common water taps, including six taps at 15 Velampalayam in the corporation limits, were serving hundreds of people daily. Even after two other water schemes with a capacity of 114 MLD came into existence, the corporation did not drop the first water scheme though its capacity was less compared to other schemes.

On Tuesday, the corporation announced that since there was hindrance in laying giant pipes for the fourth water scheme, which was also implemented from Bhavani river in Mettupalayam, the pipelines of the first water schemes were getting damaged.

A senior Twad official told TOI: “The corporation has informed us that it no longer need the first water scheme. Hence, we are operating only second water scheme for the civic body.”

Tirupur corporation commissioner K Sivakumar said, “We wanted to dismantle existing facility of main water pumping station of the first water scheme to establish main water pumping station for the fourth water scheme. Now we are buying another 10 MLD water in third water scheme from the New Tirupur Area Development Corporation, a public-private partnership initiative, to overcome deficiency created by the first water scheme. We also have planned to feed some common water taps which were served by the first water scheme.”

But the residents of 15 Velampalayam and other civic bodies are unhappy over the stopping of the scheme even before the commencement of the fourth water scheme. “The water was not supplied in the common water taps for the past three months. More than 2,000 people utilize the taps daily. Since the water of the first scheme would be tastier than the water supplied in third water scheme, which draws water from Cauvery in Erode district, many residents from various areas would come to draw water from the taps,” said V P Subramaniam, a resident of 15 Velampalayam.

M Yuvaraj, a CPI functionary in Thirumuruganpoondi, said, “The common water taps were existing for decades and they were well utilized. If the authorities failed to bring back the taps alive soon, we will stage protests.”

PATNA: Skies remained mostly cloudy on Wednesday under the influence of a western disturbance and light showers occurred in Patna in the late evening hours.

Weatherman forecasts light showers in most parts of the state on Thursday. India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its bulletin stated that thunderstorm and lightning are expected at isolated places in the state over the next 24 hours.

The Patna Meteorological Centre bulletin stated that weather remained dry across the state during last 24 hours, while dense fog was observed at Purnia and shallow to moderate fog at few other places as well.

Lowest minimum temperature was recorded at Sabour in Bhagalpur district at 8.2 degrees C. Minimum temperature in Patna, on the other hand, was recorded at 9.8 degrees C, which was a notch higher than the corresponding normal for the day.

Meteorologists attributed the comparatively higher minimum temperature to cloud cover, which prevented the radiation from the earth’s surface to escape in the upper level of atmosphere in the night and early morning hours.

The same cloud cover also led to tad higher maximum temperature in Patna at 20 degrees C, which was two notches higher than the corresponding normal.

The Patna Meteorological Centre stated that rise in night temperature is expected by 1-2 degrees C during the next two days and gradual fall by 3 to 5 degrees C thereafter. Shallow to moderate fog is also likely at one or two places during next 2-3 days.

Skymetweather, on the other hand, stated that minimum temperature will drop by two to three notches by January 10 and onwards after the cloud cover clears. It further stated that eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh received light rain during the morning hours. “This rain belt will shift further eastward tonight and cover many parts of Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, northern parts of Odisha, some parts of Bihar and West Bengal,” the Skymet report stated.

Talking about the weather system, meteorologists at Skymet stated that a trough was extending from Punjab to Bihar across east Uttar Pradesh. Easterly and south-easterly humid winds from the Bay of Bengal were also feeding moisture in east India.

“Due to the presence of this significant weather system, rainfall activities are expected to continue until Thursday in many parts of east India. By the evening of January 9, the intensity of rain will start decreasing and the minimum temperature will start increasing after this spell,” the Skymet report stated.

The meteorologists at Skymet have further predicted that the weather in east India will start clearing from January 10 and the minimums will drop by 2-3 degrees C.

IMD stated that a fresh western disturbance is likely to affect western Himalayan region from January 11 onwards, though its impact on Bihar was not ascertained yet.

3 flights cancelled: Altogether 13 flights to and from Jayaprakash Narayan International (JPNI) Airport, Patna, were affected due to poor visibility and inclement weather conditions in the city on Wednesday.

The flight operations at Patna airport began after 9.30am when the minimum 1,000m visibility of Runway Visual Range (RVR) was achieved, said a weather scientist at Patna Meteorological Centre.

According to sources at Patna airport, several incoming flights were delayed due to inclement weather in other cities, including Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai. “The flight operations remained unaffected at Patna airport. The visibility of RVR was normal throughout the day,” the sources said.

Several stranded flyers at Patna airport complained about the delays and missing their connecting flights and other important work.

One Anand Singh Gautam tweeted: “Flight-SG376 Patna to Kolkata. It was supposed to reach Kolkata at 10:50am today, but it got delayed. The flight departed at 11:10am. My friend had an interview scheduled in the afternoon.”

An executive of SpiceJet said that the flight was delayed due to the consequential impact of bad weather in Patna.

SpiceJet’s Chennai-Patna-Chennai (SG-323/324), GoAir’s Delhi bound flight (G8-133/134) and Air India’s Delhi-Patna-Delhi flight (AI- 409/ 410) were cancelled on Wednesday were cancelled due to operational reasons.

PATNA: Bihar Pradesh Congress committee (BPCC) president Madan Mohan Jha on Wednesday criticized the government for harassing the protesters and innocents while letting criminals roam free in the state. He cited the examples of gang rape of a woman who was allegedly kidnapped from a mall on Monday and raped while an undertrial was killed inside Hajipur jail recently and a couple was murdered in East Champaran on Tuesday.

While addressing a presser, Jha defended his party leader Ashutosh Sharma who is in jail after a complaint was lodged against him for thrashing a journalist during a protest in the city against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register for Citizens (NRC) on December 21.

“Police have yet not identified the murderers of our youth leader Rakesh Yadav who was killed on December 28 at Hajipur. This government is using all its power to harass the opposition leaders only. They are wasting their energy,” he said.

Jha rapped the state government for increasing crime in Bihar and said criminals were ruling the roost in the state. “Be it any day, one always gets the news of theft, robbery, murder and rape. There is no law and order here. While criminals are roaming free, innocents are being put behind the bar,” he said.

He also mocked chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s massive Jal-Jivan-Hariyali campaign as well as the other initiatives by the state government. “Has prohibition become successful? Are no dowry and child marriage being practised here? So what is the use of this new drama? Was Nitish not aware of increasing pollution level 15 years ago when he came to power? State government should make a plan to curb crime, instead of wasting time on useless things,” said Jha.

82,['9/01/2020'],CCI: Can probe unfair practices by e-comm companies,"BENGALURU: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has said it can intervene — case-by-case — to check unfair practices by online players by investigating issues such as deep discounts, exclusive agreements between platforms and suppliers, business terms and platform neutrality. The CCI report comes after e-commerce companies like Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon were under government scrutiny following complaints of unfair practices by smaller online sellers and offline retailers.In a market study of online retail, food delivery and travel bookings, the CCI has said, “Eliminating anti-competitive behaviour that further tilts the scales or deters entry assumes utmost importance.” The CCI, in its 37-page report, has advised digital commerce companies to adopt a self-regulatory approach on these issues and come up with transparent policies on search ranking, discounting policy and treatment of user data.In India, the e-commerce market is dominated by Walmart ’s Flipkart and Amazon, while the food delivery space is dominated by Swiggy and Zomato . For travel bookings online, MakeMyTrip Group , which also houses Goibibo, enjoys a lion’s share.“Imposition of unfair condition or price in sale or purchase of goods and services by dominant enterprises is prohibited under section 4 of the Act. Thus, the commission can intervene, on a case-by-case basis, in matters where unfair conditions or price is imposed through contractual provisions, by an enterprise that is dominant in the relevant market,” the CCI said.Further, it can examine contracts under section 3(4) of the Act where terms may directly or indirectly lead to an exclusionary effect on competition while also being exploitative or unfair to the business users. On exclusive agreements, the CCI is of the view that while it is not per se anti-competitive, they raise potential competition concern “when used as an exclusionary tactic to foreclose competition to rivals or to impede entry”. The regulatory body had a similar view on deep discounts as well. “Discounts offered by platforms in the early years are typically seen as a means to establish network effects for user on-boarding. However, discounts can harm competition when used as an exclusionary device by enterprises with market power,” it added. These comments from the CCI highlight concerns on increasing focus on private label play by e-tailers and their pricing, often cheaper than third-party brands. The study was first launched in April last year.Satish Meena, a senior forecast analyst at Forrester, said the report shows CCI, as a regulator, is evolving and it has started focusing more on the development in these sectors. “This will help them make their reviews clearer in future and it sends a strong message,” he said. Last year, the government made changes to FDI policy for e-tailers which forced Flipkart and Amazon to change their operating structure, which included diluting their stakes in seller entities selling on their platform. TOI reported in December how Amazon was scaling up its private brand-focused Accelerator programme and has made partial changes on search mechanism.“The findings give the CCI all evidence to pursue suo motu case against erring platforms for their anti-competitive practices,” said a spokesperson of AIOVA, a group of online sellers. Amazon India said, “Amazon welcomes the initiative by CCI to conduct a study to better understand the functioning of e-commerce in India. We are reviewing the contents of the study.” Flipkart, without commenting specifically on CCI’s observations in the report, said, “Increased adoption of a marketplaces’ efficient, transparent and accessible model will propel true growth and prosperity for India’s seller community, the retail sector and the nation.”MakeMyTrip, Zomato, Swiggy did not immediately respond to TOI’s queries.",companies,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73166176,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-67686,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//companies/cci-can-probe-unfair-practices-by-e-comm-cos/articleshow/73163445.cms

File photo used for representational purpose

NEW DELHI: Several members of JNU Teachers ’ Federation ( JNUTF ), a breakaway body of the teachers’ association, have alleged that the January 5 violence was perpetuated by those opposing the registration process. They further alleged that violence was being seen on the campus for over three months .

Asked about the allegation that some of them were involved in the violence, JNUTF members said they were only present at the spot where there was a scuffle between students.

Addressing the media, JNUTF members stated that it was unfortunate that the movement, which started against the hiked hostel charges, had now become violent. “With the active support and instigation by JNUTA, a group of students have been radicalised,” their statement said.

Calling the agitators “militants” for seizing and blocking the school buildings during their strike, JNUTF said the January 5 violence was neither sporadic nor spontaneous. “This was the culmination of a series of episodes of threats and acts of violence,” it said.

Giving the past instances of dean of students Umesh Kadam being prevented from boarding an ambulance on October 28 to how a professor was kept hostage in a classroom, JNUTF said, “Many faculty members have been abused, heckled, attacked and chased in these violent agitations. It looks like that the campus has turned into a battleground.”

Calling for normalcy on the campus, JNUTF urged the administration to ensure that they were not harassed.

JNUTF member Ashwini Mohapatra, chairman of School of International Studies, who was accused by several students of attacking them on January 4, said, “I had gone to the SIS building on the request of some students. A struggle ensued when a section of students stopped them from opening the building entrance. I didn’t attack any student.”

Mohapatra was seen in a viral video in which where ABVP member Sharvendra was hitting AISA activist Vivek Pandey.

Students and a section of faculty members stage a protest at ISI on Wednesday

KOLKATA: Around 200 students and a section of faculty members of Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) took out a rally on campus on Wednesday in protest against the assault on the students at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Clad in black, the agitating students were joined by some of the faculty members and alumni. The students staged a street play and sang Faiz’s “Hum dekhenge” and a theatre group performed a satire, titled ‘Madhusudan Dada’.

“The rally was spontaneous and was organized mainly by the students of ISI. The institute has not seen any such protest by students or teachers in a long time,” said a faculty member who participated in the rally.

“The iconic song — “Hum dekhenge” — courted controversy for no apparent reason. Students at IIT Kanpur had to face trouble after they recited the poem and it soon became an anthem for the anti-CAA protests across India,” said a research scholar.

“We organized the first rally on December 23, after the Jamia Milia Islamia incident. Many of the participants have joined in the anti-CAA, anti-NRC rallies across the city since then. But we felt the need to organize a demonstration here as well,”the research scholar added. “Though we did not shout slogans on campus, we read out the preamble of the Constitution,” he said.

Students and faculty members later created a human chain and sang the National Anthem. “The fact that we are protesting against atrocity on students does not mean that any one of us is less patriotic,” a faculty member said.

(File photo)

MUMBAI: Paytm has decided to make the best of the new regulations barring banks from charging merchant fees on payment services offered by National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ).

The country’s largest payments company has said that it will allow shops that sign up to receive payments for free from the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), RuPay cards or Paytm e-wallet . Until now, merchants had to pay a fee if their total receipts crossed Rs 50,000 in a month. While UPI and RuPay card payments can be received from any app, including that of rivals, the only catch is that the mode of payment will be through scanning a Paytm QR code.

Unlike in the past when card payments could be made only through a swipe machine, regulators have in recent years allowed card payments to be made by scanning a QR code. Paytm’s new common QR code can be used for accepting UPI payments from any bank or any RuPay card.

“We are dedicating 2020 to merchants. We will also continue investing in the payments business until 500 million Indians come into mainstream digital payments,” said Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma .

Besides doing away with merchant fees, Paytm is offering other incentives for merchants in the form of merchandise and in-app support for those who sell on credit. Also, merchants can start using the Paytm for Business app with minimum KYC and the credit proceeds to any account of their choice.

Sharma said that while the government move to do away with merchant fees was costly for the industry, it was beneficial to merchants and would help increase acceptance. “We feel that the government should reimburse the cost,” said Sharma.

He said that the company was adopting a ‘Robinhood’ approach, and large retail chains which integrate Paytm’s APIs (application programming interfaces) with their billing systems will continue to pay. At the same time, Paytm had cut some of its cost by charging customers who add more than Rs 10,000 to their digital wallet through credit cards.

According to Sharma, of the 26 billion digital transactions in India, 15 billion were payments made to merchant, of which 9 billion were those made by scanning QR codes. “Our share of the transactions at 5 billion is 54% and we have 210 million registered users in India,” said Sharma.

91,['9/01/2020'],Coimbatore lad makes his mark as tennis coach,"This story is from January 9, 2020

It was in his early teens when Mukul Karthikeyan realized that he didn’t have the financial backing to pursue a professional playing career in tennis. But the 27-year-old city lad didn’t want to let go of his first love easily and started assisting coaches in various academies in the district while studying at SBOA Matric HSS and later at PSG College of Arts and Sciences.

He learnt the ropes swiftly and his work ethic saw him flourishing as a coach. His growing reputation took him to the US, Singapore and China and he started working with renowned coaches like Van der Meer, Jeff Coetzee (South African Director of Tennis), Yu Liqiao (Chinese national team coach) and Thomas Shimada (Japanese national team coach).

Mukul’s efforts bore fruit recently when he became the youngest inductee of Indian Coach of the Year 2017, a certificate awarded by the world’s largest tennis coaching organization Professional Tennis Registry (PTR). Last year, he had achieved another feat when he was promoted as PTR International Testers and awarded PTR Indian Tester of the Year, meaning he would now adjudge Indian coaches’ credentials. PTR is the largest global organization of tennis teaching professional and coaches with 16,300 members in 125 countries.

Mukul said this was possible after he met prominent US tester Dr Louie Cap when he enrolled into the PTR certification course. “It was Louie who referred me to Van der Meer. It was during my conversations with these two gentlemen I came to understand the various nuances of the game,” he told TOI.

The 27-year-old said since tennis was still considered to be an elite sport in the country, it was a risk that he took by becoming a coach. But he is glad it all paid off. “Pursuing a career in tennis can prove to be expensive. I was young when I realized my family wouldn’t be able to back me financially. So, I charted my course accordingly and I am glad it all paid off,” Mukul, who has worked in Shanghai and coached Shanghai Province Junior team during 2017-18 season, said.

Mukul, who was a part of the USTA coaching team for tournaments in China during 2016-17, stated that his aim is to produce world-class tennis players.

“I have travelled extensively in China and really did well despite the language barrier. I focused on the technical, mental and tactical aspect of the game and the players responded positively. I have also enjoyed working with the US team. I like to work with youngsters and my focus is to produce world-class players,” he said.

Mohamed Zaid (L), Imran Khan (C) and Mohamed Haneef Khan (R)

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu ‘Q’ branch sleuths have arrested three men hailing from Bengaluru for helping the three men wanted for the July 18, 2014, murder of the Tiruvallur Hindu Munnani leader K P S Suresh Kumar flee the country.

Police said Mohamed Haneef Khan, 29, Imran Khan, 32, and Mohamed Zaid, 24, had harboured the three and helped them get fake documents to fly abroad. The three murder accused — S Syed Ali Nawas, 25, A Abdul Shamim, 25, both from Kanyakumari, and C Khaja Moideen, 47, of Cuddalore — skipped trial in December, following which the Ambattur Industrial Estate police conducted a search and reported them missing.

Police suspect they may be hiding in Bangladesh, but have no confirmation. The Tamil Nadu police said it had been keeping tabs on various fundamentalist elements and on Tuesday a ‘Q’ branch team arrested the three in Bengaluru with the help of the local police. Police also seized three pistols and 80 bullets from the three men.

Police said three men who had fled the country had been in touch with the men in Bengaluru and people in some other states, including Maharashtra.

The Tamil Nadu police had alerted their counterparts in Karnataka and Maharashtra about the possibility of fundamentalist modules operating in those states.

A city court remanded the three men arrested from Bengaluru in judicial custody.

93,['9/01/2020'],Engineer arrested for creating fake Facebook account &amp; duping Delhi girl of Rs 30 lakh,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Ajay Galar

BHOPAL: A Bhopal-based 27-year-old engineer was arrested by city crime branch on Wednesday for posing as a doctor on Facebook and duping a Delhi law student of Rs 30 lakh after befriending her. The accused created a fake Facebook profile using his relative’s photograph picture and claimed to be a doctor working at AIIMS hailing from a Jaipur royal family.

The accused, Ajay Galar, 27, a resident of Chandon village in Itarsi lured the girl in his trap by promising to marry her and duped her and her father, who runs a factory in Delhi, on pretext of treatment of his father and sister’s treatment in London for almost seven years. The accused used voice changer application on his smartphone and talked to the girl’s father posing as his father admitted to a hospital in London.

Around two months ago, the girl learnt that the man whose photograph was used in the FB profile was married to another woman in May 2019. She checked the photographs and identified the name of the hotel located in Bhopal where the marriage reception took place.

After learning that the accused had conned her, the girl decided to trap him. She came to Bhopal along with her parents and a professor by flight on Sunday and took the address of accused’s relative from the hotel where his marriage reception took place. They visited the house of the accused at a village in Itarsi and called him to meet at a mall in MP Nagar. The girl then approached Bhopal crime branch and filed a complaint after which the cops nabbed the accused when he came to meet her at the mall.

Police said a case on charges of fraud was filed against the accused. The girl gave police concrete evidence which she herself collected from the Internet that the accused had duped around a dozen other girls in a similar manner using the same modus operandi. The accused was being interrogated by police.

Investigating officer inspector Ajay Mishra said that the victim aged 25, resides with her parents at Rohini in New Delhi and a gold medalist in Fine Arts. Presently, she is pursuing LLB-LLM from Delhi. Her father runs a factory in Mongolpuri in Delhi.

Mishra said that the victim girl stated in her complaint that in June 2012, accused Ajay Galar, 27, a resident of Chandon village in Itarsi, sent her a friend request on Facebook. When she accepted the request, the accused started chatting with her and introduced himself as an oncologist at AIIMS and a member of Jaipur-based royal family.

Mishra said that on his Facebook account accused Ajay Galar, used the photograph of his relative Sourabh Mehto, who is young and good looking, as profile picture. Mehto runs a chemist shop in Bhopal and was unaware of Galar’s activity.

Galar had told the girl that he visits remote forest areas to conduct research for cancer drugs, so he does not get time to talk. He remained in contact with the victim till 2014 and then stopped contact with her.

Mishra said Galar again contacted the girl in 2017 and lured her in his trap by promising to marry her. The victim fell in his trap after which Galar started pressuring her for money. Galar told the girl that his father had brain tumour and was admitted at a hospital in London. He needed money for his treatment. The victim girl and her father transferred around Rs 30 lakh in his account in more than 100 transactions during the past three years.

Mishra said that the accused Galar used voice changing app on his smartphone and talked to the girl’s father, posing as his hospitalised father. Whenever the girl tried to visit his house in Jaipur, the accused made silly excuses citing his father’s ill health.

Mishra said that around six months ago the girl got suspicious as the accused repeatedly said that his father was admitted at the London hospital. She then started digging into his Facebook account and found the account of Sourabh Mehto with same photograph used by Galar. In the account, she found that Mehto was married to another woman in May 2019 and their wedding picture was also posted.

Mishra said that this led the girl into depression, but her professor noticed change in her behaviour and informed the girl’s parents about it. The girl’s parents stood with her and immediately booked a flight for Bhopal along with the professor. They found the hotel where Mehto’s wedding reception took his address from the hotel. They met Mehto at his chemist shop and found that he was unaware about the happenings. A retired IG who resides in Bhopal helped the victim family and asked the crime branch to help them.

Mishra said that the girl’s family members visited Itarsi where they met Galar and his father. Galar was shocked to find them at their doorsteps and knew that his game was over. He sent a message ‘please forgive me’ on the victim’s mobile number after which the complainant called him to meet at a mall.

Mishra said that when crime branch nabbed the accused Galar from the mall, he started threatening the cops that the girl had donated the money in account of the NGO he runs for women welfare and that he will return the money if she wants.

Visakhapatnam: Chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy held a review meeting on the Vizag metro rail project in Vijayawada on Wednesday.

District collector V Vinay Chand, GVMC commissioner G Srijana and Amaravati Metro Rail Corporation managing director N P Ramakrishna Reddy were present at the meeting.

Though the CM had chaired a meeting to review the progress of various projects in the city just two days ago, Wednesday’s meeting focused on the metro rail project.

Urban Mass Transit Company (UMTC), which is currently conducting a study on traffic forecasting, future vehicular and population growth for the proposed 140-km metro rail project, is expected to submit its report in the next few weeks.

While the metro component of the project will be taken up in the first phase, the tram-model public transport system will be developed in sparsely populated areas such as the beach front, Pendurthi corridor etc in the second or third phase.

Even though the project will be taken up in phases, a fresh detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared for all the proposed 140-km network falling into the jurisdiction of the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA).

The state government recently retracted the earlier bids and decided to issue fresh tenders for the project. On the other hand, the AMRC may shift its office from Vijayawada to Visakhapatnam and it is likely to be located on the sixth floor of the VMRDA office in Siripuram.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

BHOPAL: Sexual assault forensic evidence (SAFE) kit to collect ‘physical evidence’ of sexual abuse survivors is not available in most private hospitals in the state capital. Collecting blood, semen samples along with other evidences immediately after a sexual assault is key to investigations in order to catch perpetrators and bring them to justice.It has been six years since the Union government first issued guidelines for medico-legal care (MLC) for survivors of sexual violence. It includes mandatory SAFE kits in government and private hospitals. The guidelines were reissued through a health department circular on Monday following the upholding of death sentence for the four convicted men in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case.Bhopal chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Sudhir Dheriya said, “If a demand requisition from the private hospitals is received, they would be definitely be given the SAFE kits. We cannot go out supplying kits without understanding the demand.”Availability of SAFE kits and adherence to guidelines is not yet part of a checklist for CMHO office’s private nursing home registration section. A private hospital association representative said, ‘I am not aware of the SAFE Kits’.“If protocols are not followed, critical evidence is lost,” said Sarika Sinha, ActionAid director of policy and campaigns. The number of rape victims going to private hospitals is minuscule. Government-run JP hospital is the one-stop crises centre that has tracked 1,300 cases in the last couple of years. Of these, 170 required MLC examination.The first point of contact for survivors in seven cases was a private hospital in Bhopal. One of the private hospitals was along the Hoshangabad Road. The survivor’s MLC was conducted there. However, when contacted, the hospital administration admitted they were not aware of the SAFE Kit.According to Madhya Pradesh Police data, there were 312 rapes cases in Bhopal in the year 2018. During the same period, MP home department’s medico-legal institute based out of Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, reported around 270 instances where the rape accused underwent check-ups.

AHMEDABAD: A special court granted permission to Maya Kodnani , the former minister who is accused in the 2002 Naroda Gam massacre case, to visit other states by relaxing her bail conditions for another six months “so she can undertake a pilgrimage to get rid of her depression”.

The special investigation team (SIT) court granted this relaxation to Kodnani for the third occasion. Special judge M K Dave ordered that Kodnani inform the authorities at least 24 hours before she plans to leave Gujarat . She will have to inform the authorities within 48 hours on her arrival back every time. Kodnani has been told to provide her mobile number to the investigating officer and she will have to keep the number active throughout her travels outside Gujarat.

Kodnani sought relaxation in the bail condition of not leaving Gujarat, which was imposed in May 2009, claiming that she is “required to frequent outside the state for the purpose of composing herself from her ailment of depression by embarking on pilgrimages outside Gujarat along with her family members”. She is also required to attend social gatherings and functions outside Gujarat.

The court recorded that the state government did not raise any serious objection to the grant of this relief to Kodnani.

Kodnani had earlier sought permanent deletion of the bail condition, but the court granted it for six months in January 2019. The relaxation was later extended for another six months.

VADODARA: If all goes well, Wadhwana lake near Dabhoi could become the second Ramsar site in Gujarat after Nalsarovar.

The forest department has initiated the process to prepare a detailed proposal to get this prestigious status for the lake located about 50 km from Vadodara.

Wadhwana is home to thousands of migratory birds that visit the water body every winter. The state’s first and only Ramsar site Nalsarovar, 64 km from Ahmedabad, it is largest wetland sanctuary in the state and is popular for flamingoes.

“We have decided to convert the lake into a Ramsar site. Wadhwana attracts thousands of domestic and foreign migratory birds every winter. We want to develop the place and conserve it. We have roped in Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) to conduct census of birds in Wadhwana for the first time,” said Dhaval Gadhvi, deputy conservator of forests (DCF), Vadodara.

BNHS will conduct the census professional and prepare a report that will help us in making our proposal for Ramsar site stronger.

“If Wadhwana gets Ramsar site status, we will get technical guidance to conserve the wetland,” Gadhvi told TOI.

The forest department will also get guidance for financial aid that will help them in maintaining the Wadhwana Lake spread over a radius of two km in a better way.

“It is already a popular site for bird watchers and tourists. It will also attract more tourists,” Gadhvi added.

So far, the forest department has counted 58,000 migratory birds of 60 different species. The number of birds seen last winters was 98,000 of 200 species but this year it is less as the lake is brimming with water. Migratory birds usually prefer shallow waters for nesting.

“Once we get the forest department nod, we will begin documenting everything about Wadhwana wetlands and the ecosystem around. It is a lengthy procedure and the criteria are also strict. We will also have to consult the community around,” said Bhavik Patel, a marine conservationist working for BNHS.

“There are many criteria but if we even meet some of them, it will be possible to get the status. The study is on to find out species of fishes available in the lake apart from the plants,” Patel said.

Civic agencies installed bollards as part of pedestrianisation plan at Kamla Nagar

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority ( EPCA ) has in a report stated that pilot parking management plans at Kamla Nagar , Krishna Nagar and Lajpat Nagar-III markets have commenced , learnings from which will be scalable for other markets too.

EPCA, however, says that there is a need for fixing parking charges. In a meeting held with the civic bodies on Tuesday ahead of the submission of the report to the apex court, EPCA took a status report of all three markets.

Plans at Kamla Nagar and Krishna Nagar were found in an advanced stage. Krishna Nagar’s parking and pedestrianisation plans, which were implemented on Monday, have been made ‘permanent’, the east corporation informed the panel.

East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Monday successfully made a 1.5 km Lal Quarter street pedestrian-friendly by restricting vehicle movement. Unauthorised parking on the roads and hawkers from pavements have also been removed, EDMC said.

“For pedestrians, benches are installed at regular gaps and parking is allowed at newly identified parking lots. Fancy lights, flower pots and signage are other features which were added recently,” said a civic official.

However, the civic agency is yet to make certain roads one-way.

At Kamla Nagar also, demarcation on roads has been done clearly and no parking is allowed on certain roads and roundabouts. The south corporation at Lajpat Nagar-III has marked parking spaces using yellow paint but is yet to enforce the full project.

EPCA member Sunita Narain told TOI that the report, which will soon be submitted, will inform the apex court of the learnings from the pilot projects. However, the plans will not work without fixing the charges, she said.

“The file to fix the parking charges is yet to be approved and we will recommend for this to be fixed as soon as possible,” Narain added.

The Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Places Rules, 2019 were notified last year, which mandated that the 500 metre radius of a multilevel parking facility be designated as ‘no parking’ zone for all streets. In case some surface parking has to be provided in this zone, it would be priced at least three times the off-street parking rates.

The parking rules aim to discourage on-street parking for long durations through differential pricing and also moderate parking demand through dynamic pricing.

104,['9/01/2020'],Coimbatore: 32 shops fined Rs 5 thousand each for selling banned gutka items,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Representative image

COIMBATORE: Teams of food safety department officers have been conducting surprise raids at the petty shops in different parts of the city for the past four days as part of a special drive. They found 32 shops selling banned tobacco items and one shop using non-food grade plastic.

Designated food safety officer K Tamilselvan said of the 32 shops, 26 had already paid the fine. “The remaining shops are expected to pay it by Friday. Shops that fail to pay the fine will lose their licence and registration,” he said.

He said the shops were selling banned chewable tobacco products such as haans, cool lips and paan parag. “The shops were located in Gandhipuram, Arockiasamy Road and Devanga School in RS Puram, Singanallur and Sulur,” the officer said. Pointing out that they had inspected 112 shops in total, he said the shops that were selling banned items were using small sachets. “So, we could not lift the samples. Hence, we imposed fines,” he said.

A total of 31.8kg banned items worth around Rs 45,000 were seized during the special drive.

The drive was part of efforts to reduce movement of banned tobacco products in the district. “Though we are focusing on catching wholesalers and distributors, we believe that cracking the whip on petty shops that sell the banned items is also important to flush out the tobacco rackets,” Tamilselvan told TOI.

In December, food safety officers had received a directive, allowing them to impose spot fines on business operators who violate the norms.

While the first and second violations attract fine, repetition of the same violation for the third time will attract a higher amount of fine and cancellation of the registration certificate issued by the food regulator.

The officer said the spot fine system was expected to have a deterrent effect on petty shops that repeatedly flout food safety norms.

105,['9/01/2020'],"Marathon hearing over, verdict comes next in Sterlite case","This story is from January 9, 2020

Representative image

CHENNAI: The highly contentious Sterlite case is ripe for judgement as the Madras high court has concluded its 39 days of marathon hearing and reserved its order on the plea moved by Vedanta , challenging closure of its copper smelter plant in Tuticorin .

Concluding the hearing, a special bench of Justice T S Sivagnanam and Justice V Bhavani Subbaroyan complimented the senior counsels and other advocates for maintaining a cordial atmosphere throughout the hearings. The bench said it would try to deliver the order as expeditiously as possible.

On February 27, 2019, Vedanta approached HC seeking to reopen Sterlite, which was closed in view of an order passed by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) dated May 23, 2018. Vedanta moved the plea as suggested by the Supreme Court. An interim relief sought by Vedanta to permit access to the 200-acre factory premises to carry out maintenance work was rejected by the court based on the assurance provided by the state that it would take responsibility of the premises.

The state government and TNPCB represented by the advocate-general Vijay Narayan and senior counsel C S Vaidyanathan opposed the plea terming Sterlite a ‘chronic’ defaulter and that ‘unrestrained pollution appears to be standard modus operandi of the company, as it has been found guilty of various violations globally.’

Vedanta’s senior counsels Aryama Sundaram and P S Raman countered the arguments by contending that the closure order issued by the state was nothing but ‘naked discrimination’ against the company and that the GO was only a knee-jerk reaction of the state to ‘appease’ a section of public with vested interest after 13 protesters were killed in a police firing . It also alleged a Chinese company was behind its closure and claimed that the company, which had financial interest in copper manufacturing, was funding protesters to agitate against Sterlite.

Citing TNPCB pollution statistics, Vedanta said a person living inside Sterlite is safer than a person living in Anna Nagar, Chennai.

Opposing the submissions, impleaders in the plea professor Fathima and Makkal Adhigaram explained to the court as to how the environment in Tuticorin has improved after the closure of the plant.

106,['9/01/2020'],Coimbatore: Normal life largely unaffected by trade unions’ strike against Centre’s policies,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Members of trade unions and government employees staging protest in front of the district collectorate

COIMBATORE: Around 1,000 people, among them Coimbatore MP P R Natarajan, Tirupur MP K Subbarayan, members of trade unions and government employees, were detained on Wednesday for staging protest in front of the district collectorate here as some of them resorted to road roko and stopped buses.

The protest was held as part of the nationwide strike called by trade unions to condemn the Centre’s economic policies and the move to privatize public departments and public sector undertakings. Protesters said norms to register trade unions were also made very stringent.

Overall, the bandh did not largely affect the normal life in the city. While a few nationalized banks didn’t work, a total of 27 buses that ply from Ukkadam to neighbouring Kerala were not operated in the morning due to security reasons. Apart from these, the daily functioning of the city was normal with buses plying on roads and shops remaining open.

Speaking at the demonstration, the Tirupur MP said it was just a token protest against the Centre’s policies. “As trade unions have realized that they can’t fight alone, they have come together. Labour laws have been amended in worker unfriendly manners. There is no job security. These are anti-democratic and anti-labour moves. Around 25 crore workers across the country are striking and protesting today.”

Subbarayan said if the Centre did not hold talks with trade unions and bring in labour-friendly laws even after the nation-wide strike, they would take the protest to the next stage.

Trade union representatives, who participated in the protest, also put forth their specific demands.

Members of All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU) said sanitary workers were not being paid the basic wage of Rs 580 a day. “There are 6,000 sanitary workers in Coimbatore. They are not given retirement benefits and provident fund gratuity. Even after working for 10 years as contract labourers, they are not being made permanent. They should be given land and housing facilities as in the case of other government workers,” said Venkatachalam, a district representative of AICCTU. They also raised slogans against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens.

Members of Hind Mazdoor Sabha’s unorganized workers’ wing said 4,000 of them had not been paid the monthly pension of Rs 6,000 for the past six months. These workers go to shops as salespeople, work as tailors, cooks and roadside vendors.

V M Michaelraj, state information and communication secretary, Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers’ Association, said they wanted the new pension scheme to be scrapped. “The government should also revoke the new education policy. The basic pension for government staff is now Rs 3,000. It should be raised to Rs 18,000.”

Pointing out that the vacant posts in government departments that arise due to retirements were not being filled, he called on the state to fill those posts soon.

Women members of Tamil Nadu Anganwadi Workers and Helpers’ Union, meanwhile, said they were not recognized as permanent workers, despite putting in full day’s work. They said their pay should be hiked to Rs 21,000 from the present Rs 6,000. They also urged the state to appoint anganwadi workers as teachers in LKG and UKG in government schools.

Representational Image

HYDERABAD: Out of 1000 stone crusher units in the state that are causing pollution, around 300 are operating without the consent of the Pollution Control Board (PCB). Despite a vigilance report, the state government has failed to act on these polluting crushers.

A RTI reply from PCB says they have information on 690 stone crushers units operating in the state, out of which 227 were given closure notice for irregularities. Barring a few exceptions, most of the units are working in the state despite closure orders by PCB.

Rules say that the stone crusher units shall not operate within 800 metres of human habitations, but most of them are located near cities, towns and villages including near Hyderabad.

“There are around 300 crushers running without permission in the state. I have lodged a complaint regarding 12 unauthorised crushers running in GO 111 area and many of them are near Outer Ring Road,” activist Thakur Raj Kumar Singh told TOI.

“Although notifications say no stone crusher unit shall operate near ORR, they are still operating them in Vattinagulapally, Gopanapally and Khajaguda areas. In Vattinagaulapally, an infrastructure company is operating a stone crusher unit, despite NGT ’s orders,” he added..”

According to the notified rules, stone crushers have be 500 metres away from national highways and 100 metres away from state highways. Rules say that there should be a 5-metre wide green belt along the boundary of the site where the unit is located in the 50-metre wide buffer zone of the stone crushing unit.

The Vigilance and Enforcement department have recommended PCB to conduct a special drive across the state and initiate action against the erring stone crusher units.

National Green Tribunal took up the case in suo moto based on media reports and issued directions to PCB to take immediate action.

Retired IFS official Padmanabha Reddy said, “There is a lot of variation between figures furnished by TSPCB head office and regional offices. In Nizamabad alone, there are 84 crushers, out of which around 48 are running irregularly. Closure orders were issued.”

BHOPAL: With the high-powered panel giving nod to rolling out private trains in the country, three such trains are likely to originate from Habibganj , connecting the city with Hadapsar (Pune), Agartala ( Tripura ) and Holambi Kalan (Delhi).According to clusters routes, Habibganj-Holambi Kalan train will be bi-weekly single rack train. Holambi Kalan is a suburban area in the Narela sub-division of north west Delhi. It is 22 km from the New Delhi railway station. The Habibganj-Agartala will be a weekly train that will cover 2481 kms. At present, there is a train connecting Habibganj to Agartala.

Hadapsar railway station is located in a suburb of Pune in Maharashtra. Sources said there are plans to start long distance trains from this station as there is no space for new trains at the Pune junction. This station will be a major stop for Pune -Daund suburban trains.Students and businessman said such connectivity to these places will give an extra edge to railways. “As of now I have no idea as what kind of private trains will be running. I live in Hadapsar and always wanted a direct train from Bhopal,” said an IT professional Ankit Yadav.A lot of sportspersons of kayaking and canoeing belonging to North East are getting training at Upper Lake.

Ramkali Patel on her way to the tehsildar’s office with the buffalo.

BHOPAL: Things took a dramatic turn when a woman reached the tehsildar’s office in Sidhi district with a buffalo. Claiming that she didn’t have the money which was allegedly being sought from her for mutation, she urged the officials to take the buffalo instead.

Taken aback, the officials, however, rubbished the allegations. They said that transfer of title was already done on November 14 and the woman’s antics were a part of a conspiracy. The incident took place at the office of tehsildar, Sihawal, on Tuesday.

Ramkali Patel, a resident of Naudhia village, alleged, “I applied for change of title of my ancestral property. A bribe of Rs 10,000 was sought, which I paid, but the work was still not done. Again the money was sought, since I didn’t have it, I brought my buffalo here”.

When contacted, tehsildar of Sihawal, Michael Tirki, said, “Ramkali had come to office with a buffalo, she said that someone has sought bribe from her. Her case was at SDM office, but her work was already done on November 14, I even gave her a copy of the order.”

SDM Sihawal, RK Sinha said, “It was a conspiracy, her work was already done on November 14, it is also updated on the RCMS portal. Some people had apparently instigated her; it led to chaos in SDM court. So, application has been moved with police for registering FIRs against her and the other accused. The clerk named by the woman, who allegedly sought bribe, was admitted in a Nagpur hospital for three months for brain ailment and has returned recently.”

Over 10,000 agitators blocked roads with marches and bike rallies during protests. They asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government to roll back “anti-working class”, “anti-people”, and “anti-national” policies.

Staffers of Punjab National Bank, Allahabad Bank, Ayurvedic colleges, and power corporation, members of Communist Party of India (M), Anganwadi workers, ad-hoc employees, pharmacists, and others joined the protests.

“Over 10,000 people, including those who came from Haridwar, Haldwani and US Nagar, joined the protests in Dehradun ,” said Lekhraj Kumar, secretary of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU).

111,['9/01/2020'],Andhra Pradesh: Alipiri toll gate to go FASTag way soon,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Representational Image

The Alipiri toll gate, which is managed by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ( TTD ), is set to become the first non-NHAI toll plaza in the country to promote cashless travel by going the FASTag way soon.

Once the radio frequency identification-based FASTag system involving electronic collection of toll fees is installed, devotees going to Tirumala can zoom through the toll plaza instead of having to wait in long queues of vehicles. FASTag is a prepaid tag, affixed on a vehicle’s windscreen, that enables automatic deduction of toll charges and lets it pass through toll plazas without stopping for cash transaction. TTD operates the twin ghat roads leading and exiting Tirumala which stretches up to 35 kilometres together. The temple administration collects toll fees, as per rates approved by the AP government, from vehicles plying along the ghat roads leading and exiting Tirumala. The state-of-the-art toll plaza at Alipiri was built and is managed by the TTD.

The temple body has already got the necessary approvals from the National Payments Corporation to switch over from cash to electronic toll collection system and has tied up with SBI for back-end integration-related processes. TTD plans to operate around 26 FASTag counters at the Alipiri toll plaza , besides one-two dedicated lanes for TTD vehicles which are exempt from toll fees.

The only hiccup now is to rationalize the current tariff in place, to be able to synchronize it with FASTag.

The devasthanams has in place differential toll fees for same vehicles under different categories. For instance, a private car is charged 15, whereas the same car, if operated as a taxi, is charged 25. Similarly, TTD charges 30 for 8-seater SUVs, but the rate is 60 if the SUV has a commercial number plate. TTD would become the first non-government entity in the country to adopt the FASTag mode.

VADODARA: Around 30 Congress workers were arrested from the Sayajigunj area of the city while staging protests against the attack by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activists on National Students Union of India (NSUI) workers in Ahmedabad.

NSUI had planned the protest at Dairy Den in Sayajigunj and it was joined by Congress as well as Youth Congress workers. The workers were initially allowed to stage the protests, but were detained at a later stage. Those detained included city unit president Prashant Patel and leader of opposition in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation, Chandrakant Shrivastava. Congress members said that their protest was peaceful, but the police did not give them permission.

They alleged that the police was acting at the behest of the BJP and was giving permissions to BJP and other organisations to hold events in public. Patel said that the party had applied for permission for the protest. City Congress spokesman Amit Ghotikar climbed on a police van and started raising slogans. Cops too claimed the bus to detain him.

Kochi: Residents near the apartment complexes, scheduled to be demolished this weekend, have approached the high court for a court directive to urgently assess the market value of their homes to enable adequate compensation if damage is sustained during demolition .

The petition (WP-C No. 390/2020) was filed by Harichandra Sai KR and nine other residents of Nettoor through advocate Krishnadas P Nair. An admission hearing on the petition is scheduled on Thursday.

Stating that their homes and other structures are situated within a radius of 200m from the apartment complexes scheduled to be demolished on Saturday, the petitioners — who are residents of ward numbers 32 and 33 — have produced before the court a copy of the eviction notice issued by Maradu municipality as a precautionary measure.

In their plea, the residents said they are highly anxious and concerned about their residential buildings and other improvements on their properties. A representation was submitted before the municipality on November 20, 2018 and a representation was also submitted before the chief minister on December 8, 2018, seeking measures to redress their grievances.

A meeting was held on January 2 at the chamber of the minister for local self-government department in which residents and various authorities attended. But no effective decision to compensate them if their homes suffer damages was taken, the petition said.

Seeking a court order to immediately assess the market value of their residential and other buildings, the residents argued that authorities, including the state government and the municipality, are legally bound to consider their grievances. It is unfair to penalize them for the negligence of officials and they are the real affected parties of the demolition, the residents told the court.

CHENNAI: Tamil Na du Trade Promotion Organisation (TNTPO), which owns and operates the Chennai Trade Centre (CTC) at Nandambakkam, is in the process of doubling the facility’s capacity at an estimated cost of Rs 300 core. The move to expand the trade centre from about 20,000sqm to 40,000sqm will help the city attract international exhibitions that require larger space.TNTPO, a joint venture of (India Trade Promotion Organisation) ITPO and state-owned Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (Tidco), is carrying out the technical evaluation of the two bids received in a re-tender floated recently for the expansion . Once the tender is finalized within the next few weeks, the additional exhibition and convention centre capacity will be made available in about 18 months.“Chennai Trade Centre with its present capacity has been achieving an occupancy rate of 75%, which is the highest for any such centre in India. But given our size, we were not been able to attract large international exhibitions, which look for a minimum 30,000sqm of space,” V R Subbulaxmi, managing director, TNTPO told TOI.“As a result, we were losing such events to Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Post expansion, with around 40,000sqm space at our command, the city will be able to host several large international exhibitions and conventions,” Subbulaxmi added. She, however, refused to reveal the names of the bidders citing confidentiality since the process is under way.At present, CTC, which has come up over 25 acres of land, has an exhibition space of 12,000sqm and a convention hall to seat about 2,000 people.

117,['9/01/2020'],MCA orders probe into Karvy scam,"This story is from January 9, 2020

(Representative image)

HYDERABAD: After running afoul of market regulator Sebi for illegally pledging client securities with banks to raise funds, Hyderabad-based Karvy Stock Broking Ltd (KSBL) has now come under the scanner of the Union ministry of corporate affairs (MCA).

The ministry, which has been closely following developments in the KSBL demat account case, has ordered a probe into the affairs of the Karvy Group flagship under Section 206 of the Companies Act, MCA sources told TOI.

The inquiry will be taken up by the Hyderabad office of the Registrar of Companies (RoC) as KSBL is registered here. The probe comes even as EY is conducting a forensic audit of KSBL for NSE.

MCA sources said RoC has been asked to examine if KSBL, its promoters and officials violated provisions of the Companies Act and committed non-compoundable offences which are punishable by imprisonment.

“RoC will look into instances of misrepresentation of facts or misstatements in filing of balance sheets and other necessary documents. It has also been asked to look into the relationship between various Karvy group companies and related party transactions,” said a senior official.

“It will also probe if there was any misuse or diversion of funds and will try to find out in what manner the money that KSBL borrowed from banks and financial institutions was utilised,” the source added.

Sebi had, in its order dated November 22, 2019, stated that KSBL had prima facie transferred Rs 1,096 crore to its realty company, Karvy Realty, between April 1, 2016, and October 19, 2019.

KSBL had pledged securities of around 95,000 clients to raise over Rs 2,300 crore from various banks and financial institutions including ICICI Bank , HDFC Bank , Bajaj Finance, Aditya Birla Finance, Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank among others in violation of Sebi's norms. Sebi had on June 20, 2019, asked all brokers to segregate clients’ funds and securities by September 30, 2019, and report compliance of its order.

Sources said MCA may ask regulatory bodies involved in the Karvy scam probe, like Sebi, as well as NSE and EY to share their reports in the matter as part of its investigation.

It is learnt that RoC has also been asked to examine the role of auditors in case of any irregularities.

Incidentally, this is not the first time that KSBL has run afoul of the stock market watchdog. KSBL was one of the Karvy group entities that was found by Sebi to be involved in the infamous Roopal Panchal IPO scam that rocked the stock market in the mid-2000.

School students cultivating rice for Pongal celebration.

COIMBATORE: Around 800 students of St John’s Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Veerapandi Pirivu near the city are gearing up to celebrate Pongal on their campus on Saturday. The pongal they are going to cook would be special. Reason? The rice they would use for it was sown, cultivated and harvested by students themselves.

The credit goes to the school’s agricultural science group students, who had sown the rice variety TKM13. All the processes - right from preparing the field, sowing, taking care of the crop and harvesting - were done by the students of agricultural science group.

The students have produced 250kg paddy from 12 cents of land. This would translate to 5,208kg yield per hectare.

P Baskar, school principal, said they had been practicing organic gardening at the school since 2016. “We started by cultivating vegetables on our school terrace. Later, we started doing it on the campus. But we were not able to find seeds of native varieties of vegetables such as bottle gourd and brinjal. So, we started collecting native seeds. Now, we have seeds of around 50 native varieties of bottle gourd, 20 each varieties of ladies’ finger and brinjal. We share it with others as well.” They also cultivate groundnut, turmeric and shallots. Oil pressed from the groundnut is being used in the school’s hostel, according to the principal.

About the decision to cultivate paddy on the school campus, he said they wanted to sensitize students on how food was being produced. “Most of the time, students waste food casually. So, we decided to show them how difficult a task it was to cultivate rice.”

While the 32 Class XI and XII agricultural science group students were directly involved in the cultivation, the school management ensured that all other students witnessed the process stage by stage. “We made them see how the field is prepared, how paddy germinates and how it is harvested,” the principal said and lauded school correspondent R P Aravinthan, who was instrumental in the initiative.

The paddy was cultivated organically without any chemical fertilizers or pesticides. “We used only organic fertilizers such as panchagavya and dasagavya,” he said.

Students, who cultivated the paddy, said the experience was exciting and educational. M Juliana, a Class XII student, said while she had seen paddy fields from afar, this was the first time she actually got to step into one and work. “We were excited right from sowing to harvesting. We were also eager every day to see how the crop matures and bears rice. The main takeaway from the experience was learning how farmers put in dedicated efforts to produce food,” said the student, whose ambition is to become a researcher in organic farming.

The school does organic farming on a 50-cent plot on its campus, of which paddy is cultivated on 12 cents. The students, who sowed paddy on August 11 last year and transplanted seedlings on September 26, had harvested it on January 4.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: The JNU administration has been asked by Delhi Police to plug the gaps in the campus boundary walls to prevent the entry of outsiders.

During a survey conducted on Tuesday evening, police found several portions of the boundary walls broken or unfenced. Sources said these sections might have been broken by miscreants, giving them direct access to the forested areas within the campus, which are usually not under surveillance by security guards.

At least two points have been identified by police near the main gate on the north side of the campus where a portion of the wall is broken. A little ahead, the grilles fixed above the perimeter wall were found missing.

A few areas in the campus, including forested zones, are connected to Sanjay Van near Kishangarh . These can be used by outsiders to enter the campus without the knowledge of the security guards. The guards have been asked to conduct regular patrols in groups to apprehend outsiders.

The security officers at JNU have been advised to tighten the entry rules and only allow people with valid identity cards to enter the campus. They have been asked to increase the security at the six entrance gates, especially the ones on Khajan Singh swimming pool side, Parthasarathy Rocks and Pashchimabad.

The university authorities have been asked to step up security outside hostels, administration block and other important locations and increase the number of securitymen to nearly double the usual. A security team would also be deployed to patrol the dark areas. The security personnel have been directed to question unknown faces in the premises.

Police have asked the security agency to stop entry of outsiders in hostels without the permission from the university authorities. JNU had deployed over 270 ex-servicemen on security duty in the campus last year. They will now be put on surveillance duty outside the campus too.

HYDERABAD: It’s a problem of plenty for banks with Rs 10 coins bursting out of currency chests. With very few takers for these coins now, banks in Hyderabad and the state have stopped placing indents with RBI for Rs 10 coins.Senior officials attribute this mainly to banks facing storage issues. The currency chests are operated under the direct control of RBI, which supplies the coins along with cash after receiving indents from various banks. “However, the circulation of Rs 10 coins is very slow in Telangana when compared to other states,” pointed out the authorities.Little wonder, banks are urging RBI to take cognisance of this problem and create more awareness among customers. Banks are also organising meetings with traders and business community to allay their fears and sensitise them that coins are a legal tender. “Banks have been displaying boards that Rs 10 coins are valid and very much in vogue,” an official explained.Highly-placed sources said major banks have been impressing upon RBI to take the matter seriousl—y and not dismiss it as a small issue. Telangana has 156 currency chests, with a majority of them (37) located in Hyderabad.The issue struck a sore note after rumours started doing the rounds that fake Rs 10 fake were in circulation in the market and that RBI had demonetised the coins. Ever since, people have stopped accepting or exchanging Rs 10 coins.“Its impact is felt more in southern states. We used to convince customers that the coins are valid and they can use them,” said Manoj Bhat, who served as a manager in Andhra Bank, Ashok Nagar.Traders and shopkeepers have also developed cold feet in exchanging or rotating these coins. Mohammed Sharif, who owns a kirana shop in Vidyanagar, said: “People refuse to accept Rs 10 coins when I give the change. Many think they are fake. Though banks accept these coins, they hesitate to accept them in large quantities.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73166473,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-360690,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/banks-in-predicament-over-rs-10-coins-circulation-takes-a-hit/articleshow/73163137.cms

Bank employees taking out rally during the trade unions’ nationwide strike at MP Nagar on Wednesday.

BHOPAL: Banking operations in the state were affected on Wednesday as around one lakh employees and officials of central trade unions including banks observed strike.

Besides, several employees of the energy sector in Madhya Pradesh too called for a strike against the draft amendments to the Electricity Act, 2003.

As many as 10 Central Trade Unions (CTUs) had called for a ‘ Bharat Bandh ’ to protest the ‘anti-people’ policies of the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.

However, operations of State Bank of India (SBI) were not impacted as very few of its employees and officials are members of the bank employees’ unions that called for the nationwide strike. The protesting bankers and employees of rest of the PSUs took out a rally from Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) in MP Nagar at around 10.30am till Indira Press Complex.

Veerendra Sharma, a member of a trade union , said, “Employees of around 5,000 different branches of banks participated in the protests, and these branches do business of around Rs7 lakh crore daily. In Bhopal alone, there are a total of 500 branches of the banks whose employees participated in the protests. These branches do a business of around Rs1.4 lakh crore per day which was affected due to strike.”

Meanwhile, thousands of engineers working in the energy sector of the state went on strike on Wednesday. Though office works were affected, energy supply and maintenance mostly remained unaffected. The Madhya Pradesh Vidyut Mandal Abhiyanta Sangh, a body of engineers working in the energy department, had called the strike as per the decision of National Co-ordination Committee Of Electrical Engineers and Employees (NCCOEE), a national body of employees in the energy sector, who have raised issues over the draft amendment to the Electricity Act, 2003.

“We have given an ultimatum that if the government moves on and calls an ordinance, we would go for complete shutdown,” the Sangh’s state general secretary VKS Parihar told TOI.

123,['9/01/2020'],‘Appoint welfare officers to check people in coma’,"This story is from January 9, 2020

File photo used for representational purpose

NEW DELHI: Plugging a gap, Delhi high court asked the state government to appoint welfare officers in each district to check on persons lying in coma , to ensure an oversight system was in place.

The court laid down broad guidelines for such patients who were comatose and were unable to put their finances and assets in order before the tragedy.

Justice Rajiv Shakdher noted that there were no rules and regulations governing the welfare of such persons, stressing the need for guidelines to ensure that the legal guardian in charge of the comatose patient was held accountable.

It directed the department of social welfare of the AAP government to ensure that public officials/social welfare officer or officers of equivalent rank visit patients lying in comatose state and submit a detailed report.

The court said only the spouse or children could be appointed the legal guardian of a person in coma and they must disclose the details of all tangible and intangible assets of the patient. In case the patient had no legal heirs or was abandoned by the family, his next friend could be appointed as a guardian with the prior permission from a court.

HC’s directions came while interpreting various laws — the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, the Mental Health Act, 1987 (repealed), the National Trust Act for the Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation, the Multiple Disabilities Act, 1999, the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. Justice Shakdher said the definitions of these provisions showed a person in coma was not covered under any of the Acts which was why the court needed to step.

The guidelines also include that the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) or tehsildar concerned, under whose jurisdiction the person lying in coma was located, should conduct an inquiry to establish the veracity of the assertion and to gather details of the person who wished to be appointed as a guardian.

HC said the person appointed as a guardian would file a report with the registrar of the high court after every six months and if the guardian misused his power, siphoned or misutilised the assets of the patient, the court would have the power to remove him and appoint another person.

HC’s order came on a plea filed by daughters of a comatose woman after the State Bank of India refused to release money deposited in a PPF account of their dead father. SBI took the stand that a guardianship certificate had to be obtained from the district court concerned but HC disagreed, and allowed the plea of the daughters. It asked SBI to transfer the amount to the joint account of the two women with their mother, after HC verified from doctors that the mother was comatose and needed expensive treatment.

Vijayawada: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday asked his cabinet colleagues to pull their socks up for the local body elections scheduled for the next two months. The high court had earlier directed the State to complete the local body polls — both municipal and panchayat — by March 2020.

The chief minister told the 13 ministers incharge for the state’s districts to leave no stone unturned in preparation for the elections. As this is the first election that his government faces after its massive victory in the 2019 general elections, the polls will be a litmus test to see if YSRC will be able to keep its vote base intact after seven months in power.

Also discussed during the meeting was agitations in parts of the state on the three capitals proposal of the government. The chief minister listened to the views of his cabinet colleagues on the matter and suggested ways to counter complications.

Some of the ministers, it is learned, expressed apprehension over public resentment due to the sand issue. However, the chief minister asked them to prepare the party rank and file at the grassroots level to counter allegations and explain real issues. The chief minister had told them to popularise government welfare programmes and initiatives giving due representation to weaker sections and women. He wanted them to talk more about the schemes that were rolled out in the last six months to cross sections of the people, besides Acts like Disha.

The chief minister had also asked them to explain the three capitals concept to people to counter the TDP’s “campaign against the government”. He directed the ministers to distribute copies of expert committee reports to party leaders at the grassroots level to counter criticism.

The YSRC had won the people’s mandate in the Assembly polls in a massive sweep, leaving the TDP to nurse wounds. Several TDP leaders in the aftermath of the polls had defected to the YSRC.

VADODARA: While the deaths of children at various state-run hospitals across Gujarat have raked up a major controversy, data available with the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) indicates that the infant mortality reported in the city has gone down marginally.

VMC health department officials have been on their toes digging up data and preparing reports ever since the controversy came to light. Data collected for the years 2019 and 2018 reveals that the number had gone down by 152.

According to VMC sources, 1,338 infants had died in hospitals in the city in 2018. Against this, 1,186 infants died in hospitals in the city in 2019. Officials said that the data was more reliable as it included all the hospitals in the city.

Monthly data of infant deaths provided by officials for the two years also indicates that in 2019, there were only four months where the number of infant deaths was higher as compared to 2018. In the remaining eight months the figures had gone down ensuring that the total number of deaths of infants in 2019 remained lower as compared to 2018.

An official in the health department even defended the government hospitals saying that the numbers there often seemed higher as very critical cases were often sent there by private hospitals.

“If the parents cannot afford treatment or if there is little chance of the infant surviving, the infants are referred to government hospitals where deaths take place,” said the official.

Sources added that some infants died at government hospitals after births as they were often born to mothers from poor families who may not have got necessary care and nutrition during pregnancy. “Proper care during pregnancy under various initiatives can ensure this does not happen,” said an official.

COIMBATORE: The city police on Wednesday arrested a 40-year-old native of Kerala after he allegedly cheated people by promising to return triple the amount of their investments within 150 days.

The accused has been identified as T Bony Thomas, of Ernakulam.

“About three months ago, he started a private finance company at Alamu Nagar in the city. He publicized that the firm would provide 2% interest per day on investment and would return triple the investment amount within 150 days. Believing this, several people deposited lakhs of rupees in the company,” a police officer said.

About 20 days ago, Thomas closed the company and went into hiding. Initially, the victims waited for him to open the company. As the days passed without any progress, they lodged a police complaint.

Pointing out that the complainants had deposited about Rs15 lakh each, the officer said the company had returned them a few lakhs by way of daily interests. According to the officer, while five people had come forward to lodge a complaint, the actual number of people who had invested in company was yet to be identified. Thomas was arrested on Wednesday and produced before a judicial magistrate who remanded him to judicial custody.

Aerial view of the Jain Coral Cove flat complex (File photo)

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As Kerala is set to witness the demolition of apartments built in violation of CRZ norms at Maradu , the government will have to deal with over 26 ,000 CRZ violations across 10 coastal districts. Coastal district committees (CDC), constituted by the government following the directive of Supreme court, has identified 26,259 CRZ violations, stated the interim reports furnished by respective CDCs.

The final report will be compiled and submitted by 10 CDCs before January 12. Though officials say that number could reduce further following site inspection and document verification, there would still be a sizable number of violations which will have to be dealt with by the government.

In September 2019, the Supreme Court had directed the chief secretary to prepare a list of CRZ violations and government constituted CDCs in Kasaragod, Kannur, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Thrissur, Ernakulam , Kottayam, Alappuzha, Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram .

CDCs submitted three interim reports between October and December 2018. As per the third interim report, Kollam topped the list with 4,868 violations, followed by Alappuzha (4,536) and Ernakulam (4,239). Kottayam recorded the least at 147. Over 3,000 violations were detected in the capital and Kozhikode. The list of Ernakulam identifies two CRZ violations in the third interim report in Kochi corporation. Both are residential flats with built-up area greater than 7,500 sq m.

The report said that a pilot survey on highrises in Maradu municipality and Kochi corporation was carried out by the town and country planning department. The survey identified 41 buildings in Maradu municipality and 93 buildings in Kochi corporation’s limits. This exercise was done by overlaying Coastal Zone Management Plan (2011) over the current Google images and verifying (on site) through departmental surveyors.

These identified highrises in CRZ areas of the municipality and corporation will be further verified with relevant documents to find the actual CRZ Violations among them. A special cell and advisory committee on CRZ has been constituted for the district under the chairmanship of the subcollector (Fort Kochi) to give notice to the constructions for submitting details regarding the approvals obtained for their construction.

In Kozhikode corporation area, 1,615 violations have been identified, one of the highest violations in corporations. Officials said that the government cannot take a call on regularization. The norms mandate that decision has to be taken by KCZMA for which the authority can forward a recommendation to the ministry of environment and forests.

Kottayam CDC reported that one of the limitations in identifying violations was the absence of a KCZMA expert in the committee. Other CDCs have also reported the inability to report on the latitude and longitude within a short time period. Categorization of violations based on floor area will be the key since even if exemption can be granted in case of residential constructions, there must be a limit which can be set based on floor area, an official said.

Tirumala police arrested a government official from Telangana for posing as an IPS officer to obtain the most sought after VIP darshan ticket at Tirumala on Wednesday.

According to DSP T Prabhakar Babu, Shyamala Arun Kumar Pandu (45), who said he works as the deputy director of weaver’s service centre at Hyderabad, presented a fake identity card in which his designation was printed as officer on special duty at the agriculture, marketing and warehousing department, Andhra Pradesh secretariat, and tried to obtain VIP break darshan tickets from the additional executive officer’s camp office at Tirumala.

Upon verification by TTD staff, it was confirmed that the identity card was a fake one. Following a complaint lodged by the TTD, Tirumala police took Arun Kumar into custody. What startled the police was that Arun Kumar who works as deputy director as per protocol can apply for VIP break darshan using his own credentials, but instead chose to pose as an IPS officer.

DSP Prabhakar Rao said, ‘‘Our investigation revealed that Arun Kumar aspired to become an IPS officer. But since that could not happen, he got into the habit of impersonating IPS officers and enjoyed the attention.”

COIMBATORE: A day after a video of women staff of a petrol bunk changing dress in a room at their workplace at Kannappan Nagar in in Saibaba Colony went viral, the city police on Wednesday arrested three people for circulating the same on social platforms.

The Saibaba Colony police identified the arrested as Manikandan and Subash, both employees of the petrol bunk, and Maruthachalam, a vernacular journalist.

Subash had hidden a mobile phone in the dressing room of women staff of the petrol bunk and captured the images of them changing dress using its camera about four months ago. Manikandan’s wife came across the mobile phone and alerted her husband, who reportedly deleted the video and smashed the phone, a police officer said.

Police, however, didn’t register a case as none of the victims came forward to lodge a complaint. Meanwhile, the video surfaced on social media on Tuesday and went viral. Following this, two of the victims lodged a complaint with the Saibaba Colony police on Wednesday.

Based on the complaint, police registered a case under Section 354(C) of Indian Penal Code; Sections 66(E), 67 (A) of the Information Technology Act, 2004; Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act, 2002; and Sections 3, 4 and 6 of the Indecent Representation of Women Act, 1986.

The officer said Subash had retrieved the video from the mobile phone and shared it with Manikandan, who forwarded the same to Maruthachalam. “It was Maruthachalam who circulated the video on social media.”

In a related development, the Saravanmapatty police have lodged a case against three employees of the petrol bunk – Shankarganesh, Kavidhasan and Saravanan – for assaulting Manikandan, who is undergoing treatment at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital. The trio assaulted him following allegations that he stole petrol from the bunk, the officer said.

COIMBATORE: The district police have nabbed a 26-year-old man from Kerala for murdering a Class XII girl student, with whom he was in a relationship, and dumping her body near Varattuparai in Valparai on the outskirts of the city on Tuesday after she started to avoid him. He was handed over to the Kerala police on Wednesday.

The Valparai police identified the arrested as S Sabharsha, a resident of Ernakulam in Kerala. He was employed with a car showroom at his hometown.

A police officer said Sabharsha had picked up the girl, also from Ernakulam, from her school around 2pm on Tuesday in a car that he had taken from the showroom without informing his senior officials.

As the girl did not return home even by the late evening, her parents lodged a complaint with the assistant police commissioner in Ernakulam. Based on the complaint, police launched an inquiry and found that the girl was last seen with Sabharsha. The Kerala police subsequently traced his whereabouts to Valparai by tracking his mobile phone tower details and alerted their counterparts in the district.

The Valparai police immediately sprang into action and alerted all the police stations in its limits to start vehicle check. They nabbed Sabharsha near Kadamparai check post around 7.30 pm on Tuesday.

“There was a pool of blood in the car and he was taken into custody. During the inquiry, he said he was in a relationship with the girl. About a couple of months ago, she told him her plans to pursue higher education in abroad and started to avoid him,” the officer said.

A provoked Sabharsha then hatched a plan to murder her. “On Tuesday, he brought her to Valparai and stabbed her in her neck and chest with a knife that was hidden in the car. After murdering her, he threw the body in a forest near Varattuparai,” the official said.

Pointing out that Sabharsha had forgotten the exact the location where he had dumped the body, the official said it took them almost three hours to recover the body. “We retrieved the body by 1am on Wednesday. Both the body and the accused were then handed over to the Kerala police.”

The combing operation was led by Valparai inspector of police Balamurugan. The team comprised SI Prabhakaran, special branch head constable Navaneetha Krishnan, SB-CID Yesian and other police officials.

Continuous rainfall led to waterlogging in many areas of Dehradun

DEHRADUN/MUSSOORIE: Light to moderate rains continued to lash most parts of Uttarakhand, including Dehradun , for the second consecutive day on Wednesday. Besides, heavy snowfall was also witnessed in neighbouringhill stations of Mussoorie and Dhanaulti. The continuous rains that had been lashing the state capital since the past 48 hours threw life out of gear with most people preferring to stay indoors and offices reporting low attendance.

The rains also left drains in many areas clogged and garbage overflowing resulting in sanitation woes in many areas such as Selaqui and Premnagar. According to officials of meteorological department, Dehradun witnessed 6.9 mm rains on Wednesday while 19.2 mm rains had lashed the state capital on Tuesday. Waterlogging was also reported from many areas in the city.

Umesh Karanwal, a resident of Raipur, said, “Be it monsoons or winters, Dehradun roads always look like ponds. In Raipur, potholes have broadened in the past two days and authorities don’t seem to care.”

In a similar vein, Minakshi Singh of Dilaram Bazaar area said, “In our locality, rainwater has completely drenched overflowing dustbins leading to an unbearable stench.”

The winter rainfall also affected the public transport system of the city. Commuters were left stranded at several places as tempos and auto rickshaws struggled to move.Many commuters could be seen wading through water and braving the cold to reach their destinations.

Meanwhile, after two days of continuous rainfall, Mussoorie on Wednesday witnessed yet another spell of snowfall. Although it had started snowing in the morning, the Mall Road area witnessed little accumulation of snow on the ground due to intermittent rain .

However, heavy snowfall resumed around 5 pm and the Mall Road area was soon draped in a thick blanket of white with vehicles, buildings and other structures getting covered with snow.

Saurabh Singh, a tourist from Delhi said, “The snowfall that I have seen here is just amazing. It is very cold but still we don’t want to go inside our hotel room and keep revelling in this natural wonder.”

Meanwhile, due to slippery roads, vehicles got stuck at various parts of the town and Kulri. Vehicular movement was affected between Gandhi Chowk and Zero Point in the morning hours and JCB had to be deployed to clear the road. Similarly, traffic was affected at Mullingar and Lal Tibba area.

Speakers from different communities called for making the DNA test demand known to the country through social ... Read More

Nagpur: In yet another rally in the series of protests against CAA and NRC, over 10,000 took out a march that began from Shivaji statue, in the backyard of RSS headquarters at Mahal, on Wednesday. These protests took on a distinct anti-upper caste tinge as participants demanded implementation of CAA, NRC and NPR on the basis of DNA tests “that would render the upper caste stateless” based on the notion that upper castes being descendants of Aryans were the real outsiders.

A mass pledge was administered to the participants asking not to let the Modi government implement CAA and NRC unless it agrees to conduct the DNA test.

Speakers belonging to different communities called for making the DNA test demand known to the country through social media. “I request my young brothers and sisters who are experts users of WhatsApp, Insta, Twitter, Facebook etc to make this demand on the virtual world,” said a speaker.

Slogans such as ‘Sabse Bada Atankwad Brahamanwad’ (Brahminism is biggest terrorism), an oblique reference to RSS and other Hindutva organizations, were also raised.

Organized by BAMCEF, an Ambedkarite organization, the protesters were predominantly Muslims and also a motley group of Dalit and other sects.

A few hands were also seen holding saffron banners with the picture of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji, apart from tricolors. “We are from the Sena,” said a protester quickly as a member of the organizing team clarified that it is Chatrapati Shivaji Sena, an NGO, and not Shiv Sena. Jai Shivaji, Jai Bhim, chanted the protesters as they raised the regular slogans coined during CAA and NRC protests.

Billed to be a non-political rally, workers from Congress and other left organization were also seen, who said they had voluntarily joined. “A report said all the upper caste in the country are outsiders and they have Jewish DNA,” said a speaker. “We are the original inhabitants of the country,” he said. “We just responded to messages we got through social media. The protesters are from different sects. I am from Congress but there are others too,” said Nash Ali, a Congress worker.

Starting from Mahal, the rally passed through lanes of Mominpura and turned toward Dalit-dominated Kadbi Chowk before reaching Samvidhan Chowk.

Several protesters were seen making live videos and sharing photographs from the spot on social media. The move aimed to target the BJP’s IT cell which they accused of spreading ‘lies’ about the peaceful protest taking place across the country.

The rally Bahujan Kranti Morcha was part of similar protests in 550 districts throughout the country. Protesters were also seen holding creative posters ridiculing the NRC, CAA and the Modi-Shah duo. They also said core issues of petrol price hike, onion prices, lack of jobs, GDP, and country’s economy should be addressed.

The BJP’s call for removing ‘illegal migrants’, which protesters said was an indirect reference to Muslims, was countered by the slogan for cleansing the country of ‘Videshi Brahmans’. A Muslim speaker said the community had been quietly tolerating oppression by government over years. “Everyone is now a victim of their (BJP) oppression. They have to be unseated to stop this injustice,” he said.

BHOPAL: BJP leader Uma Bharti on Wednesday came out in support of BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya , and said party workers will court arrest and go to jail if he is arrested.

Condemning the Congress government for “filing cases” against Vijayvargiya and his supporters, Bharti tweeted: “Kailash ji has raised his voice against injustice. His statement is the sentiment of BJP workers. Police have registered FIRs against him and several other workers. The government has said Kailash ji could be arrested and sent to jail. If this happens, BJP workers will also court arrest.”

In Sehore, former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan joined a protest rally against what he called “high-handedness by the Congress government”. “Fake cases are being registered against BJP workers while police have been patronising crime, illegal mining and gambling in the region,” he alleged.

Attacking the state government, he said, “No public service, but an extortion drive is being conducted in Sehore district . A corrupt minister is trying to cause trouble for the people of my region. Shivraj will die but not let this happen.”

BJP state president Rakesh Singh also warned of an agitation against cases registered on saffron workers. “Efforts are being made to harass and suppress BJP workers through fake cases. If you put an evil eye on BJP workers, the entire BJP family will come out on roads to fight the cause. In Ashoknagar, a fake case under Section 376 IPC was registered against BJP district media in-charge Devendra Tamrakar. BJP will meet DGP to apprise him of the facts,” Singh said.

Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: A twitter war broke out between AAP and BJP on Wednesday when CM Arvind Kejriwal questioned the validity of the saffron party’s announcement that if elected to power it will give “five times” the subsidy given by his government.

“Five times more subsidy than us? Meaning? Will you give 1000 units of electricity free instead of 200 units? Instead of 20 thousand litres, one lakh litres of water will be given free? You are making fun of the public by making such promises. Start these schemes in any one of the BJP-ruled states before promising in Delhi (sic),” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted.

Replying to Kejriwal’s tweet, Tiwari asked Kejriwal the total amount AAP government spent on these facilities per family in the last five years .

“Whatever claims Kejriwal makes of having given benefits during the last five years, BJP will do at least five times more work for the people of Delhi. This will be done with the formation of government in February. The AAP leader should tell the people of Delhi how much benefits he has given to each family during the last five years,” Tiwari said.

“The chief minister is talking about those things which he has started doing in last three months of his government. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP government will work for a prosperous Delhi with positivity,” he added.

Tiwari had earlier told TOI that his government would give five times the benefits currently being given by AAP government.

137,['9/01/2020'],"RSS is fascist, based on Hitler ideology, says Digvijaya Singh","This story is from January 9, 2020

Digvijaya Singh

BHOPAL: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Wednesday launched a fresh assault on RSS, calling it a “fascist organization” based on the ideologies of Hitler and Mussolini. He said the word ‘Hindutva’ doesn’t exist in the scriptures, and RSS “cannot be accepted as an organisation of Hindus”.

Addressing the training camp of Congress’ grassroots organization Seva Dal here on Wednesday afternoon, Digvijaya alleged that the Saraswati Sishu Mandir schools run by RSS educational wing Vidya Bharati “teach hatred to children, which gives birth to violence”.

Referring to the recent controversy over a book on Veer Savarkar distributed at the camp, the former CM said: “Veer Savarkar had two major phases in his life. One, when he fought against the British Raj and was sent to the Andaman prison. Second, when he apologized and returned. It is the second phase that we do not support after which he misled and polluted the politics of the nation.”

Singh argued, “Hindutva is not mentioned in the scriptures and has no relation with religion. We cannot accept RSS as an organization of Hindus. It is a fascist organization in which is imbibed in the ideologies of Hitler and Mussolini. This is in contrast to the culture of India. Unity in diversity is the strength of our nation.”

“The minds of RSS leaders and activists are constricted, only dividing and breaking society. But Congress unifies. The concept of Vasudeva Kutumbakam is the idea that identifies India,” he said.

Congress is weak in ideological politics, he remarked. “WhatsApp University is poisoning the minds of our children. Saraswati Sishu Mandirs are schools where hatred is taught, which gives birth to violence. And violence gives birth to terrorism,” he said, adding that the country is going through “critical times”.

Targeting the BJP-led Centre, Digvijaya said, “Violence generates violence. Non-violence spreads love and communal harmony. No country can prosper and develop with violence and hatred. Disturbance and violence breaks even families. Today, what is happening is only to divide the nation. Be it Article 370 or the Citizenship Amendment Act, they have all been passed to polarize the country into Hindu versus Muslim. They have no other agenda.”

Reacting to Digvijaya’s allegations, state BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agarwal said, “Vidya Bharati imparts education through Saraswati Sishu Mandirs in remote tribal and inaccessible areas. By saying that these schools teach hatred and violence, Digvijaya Singh is insulting the students of these schools and their parents. He was chief minister for 10 years and should have set up schools in such areas, which he didn’t. His intention is to incite feelings of minorities.”

RSS was founded by Dr Hegdewar in 1925 and many Congress leaders, including former President Pranab Mukherjee, have praised and recognised its contribution, Agarwal said. “At least, Digvijaya should learn to respect his party’s leaders. The Supreme Court had defined Hindutva as our nation’s way of life. Whose decision is more authentic? Digvijaya Singh’s or Supreme Court’s? Obviously, not Digvijaya’s,” he remarked.

CUTTACK: Residents’ organisations here have expressed concern at the alleged poor quality of restoration of roads that have been dug up for the laying of underground sewer lines. Convener of Mahanagar Nagarika Mancha, a residents’ organisation, said, “Re-establishment of the roads is being done in a hurried manner. They are not being strengthened adequately.”

“The stretches that have been renovated after completion of sewer line work over the past two years are riddled with potholes. They leave a lot to be desired,” said Pravat Ranjan Dash, a social activist and lawyer. Several residents also alleged that a few of the roads dug up for the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)-funded integrated sanitation project had caved in as the restoration was shabby.

JICA project-in-charge Basanta Kumar Parida told TOI on Tuesday that residents had no cause of worry as the road restoration was being done following the ‘compaction process’.

“The foundation of the roads in most parts of the city is quite old. Before compaction, the roads are being restored temporarily through sand filling. The process of compaction takes nearly a month to two months,” Parida explained.

The JICA project envisages a sewage system with an underground gravity sewer line of length 352km. So far, 292km of sewer lines have been completed through digging, requiring restoration of an equal length of roads. Parida explained that previously only those stretches of the roads that had been dug up were restored. Consequently, the other stretches of the roads had deteriorated. “Now, we are trying to overcome the problem by renovating all portions of the roads that are being dug up,” said the project in-charge.

In October, the Odisha Human Rights Commission (OHRC) had taken note of the problems being faced by the people of the city because of the excavated roads.

The court had said the project was seriously affecting traffic and blamed it on the lack of coordination between different departments of the government and the project officials.

The OHRC had sought the formation of a four-member committee headed by the commissioner of the Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) ‘to monitor smooth working of the JICA project’. The committee has as representative the DCP Cuttack, ACP (traffic), Cuttack, and the planning member of the Cuttack Development Authority .

Ambhore, however, denied the charges and said he had gone to request the deputy registrar to call a subject expert in commerce for the interview of PhD students. He also alleged that Netke took this opportunity to settle score with him as the former had once chaired a committee, inquiring Netke’s involvement in scams.

According to police, Netke has lodged a complaint saying that Ambhore forcefully entered into his office asking why the latter was not following the directions on appointing referees for the PhD interviews.

“Netke told Ambhore that experts were being appointed according to norms. To which Ambhore got upset and started abusing the deputy registrar,” a police officer said.

“This led to an altercation between the two following which Ambhore threatened Netke. The suspect was accompanied by another 34-year-old man. We have booked Ambhore and the other suspect under sections 353, 504 , 506 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code,” he added.

Ambhore termed the allegations as baseless and said everything would be clear if the closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera footage is checked. “Netke and his supporters have got an opportunity to malign my image as I was to appear in the interview for university registrar’s post. While chairing a committee appointed to inquire into the allegations of corrupt practices, I had recommended action against Netke. The complaint has been made with a prejudiced mind,” he said.

Kanpur: The banking services in all the banks, barring the State Bank of India, were majorly hit though the business in the Industrial City was usual following the nation-wide strike called by various trade unions protesting the 'anti-people' policies of the Central government.

To recall, ten central trade unions--INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC along with other independent federations and associations, had adopted a declaration in September last to go on a nation-wide strike on January 8.

Most of the markets and commercial establishments in the city were open and the transport services also remained unaffected.

Arvind Raj Swaroop of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) terming the 'Bharat Bandh' great success in the city, said that it passed off peacefully with maximum participation of members of various trade unions.

The representatives of various trade unions held sit-ins at various government and non-governmental establishments across the city, he added.

The production in most of the factories in Dadanagar and Panki industrial area was hit with minimal presence of workers. No untoward incident, however, was reported so far from any part of the city. A large deployment of police personnel had been made at major junctions in the city.

Almost all the branches of the SBI were functional as its employees had limited participation in the strike.

ERODE: A black headed Ibis, believed to have originated from Australia, was found running around Kattupalayam, a small village in Erode district on Tuesday.

Villagers flocked to the veterinary hospital in Modakurichi to see the bird before it was handed over to the Vellode bird sanctuary.

As part of its annual route, the bird might have migrated to India but lost its way and was unable to fly back home due to sustained back injury.

On Tuesday evening, a farmer in kattupalayam heard the anguished cries of a bird only to see dogs chasing an injured bird.

The farmer immediately carried the bird in his arms and took it to veterinary hospital in Modakurichi.

“We gave the bird initial treatment for its injuries, likely caused by the chasing dogs.”

“The bird was handed over to the Vellode bird sanctuary on Wednesday evening, where it will heal fully and fly back to its country,” said an official.

Bhubaneswar: Twenty-five-years ago when Chumki Datta, an advertising professional from Kolkata, made Bhubaneswar her home little did she know that life would throw up challenges she least expected. She not only stood strong and weathered the storms in her life but has now extended a helping hand to the intellectually disabled, putting them on the path of economic empowerment.

“An accident in 2003 paralysed me from the waist down. I have been wheelchair-bound since. Within six to seven years of the incident, my husband, who was my caregiver passed away. Fate dealt a body blow to me but I did not give up on my dreams,” said Chumki, who has now stepped into her 50s.

Her dreams led to the birth of Vriddhi training-cum-production centre, an SHG, in December 2017. Operating from the National Career Service Centre for Differently abled under ministry of labour and emploment, Vriddhi trains people with disability, particularly those with intellectual disability, in making soaps and handmade paper bags. She was handed over the responsibility by the government that was looking for a business organisation for the disabled as she was already working for them. The government provided the space and equipment required for the unit.

At present, the organisation makes seven varieties of natural handmade soaps —honey oats, honey haldi, besan haldi, petals, chandan haldi, aloe vera and neem. Priced between Rs 60 and Rs 85, the soaps come in the shape of regular soap bars or in the shape of roses and sold in the market.

These soaps are made by 12 to 13 intellectually disabled young adults, aged 18- 25, and supervised by six to seven parents and an orthopaedically-handicapped person.

“These children are very receptive to instructions,” said Sanjukta Patnaik, 64, whose 34-year-old son is involved in soap making. The young adults are also happy coming out of the confines of their homes and working with their friends. “The profits are distributed among the young adult workers. The economic empowerment has boosted their confidence,” said Patnaik.

Vriddhi has also forayed into making incense sticks, scented candles, notebooks of handmade paper and “badis” of two different flavours. Before Vriddhi came into being, Datta worked as an entrepreneur in city beautification and doing up the interiors of the Tribal World showroom. She has won a national award for being a successful self-employed person with locomotor disability in 2017 and Anjali award in 2019.

145,['9/01/2020'],Madras High Court asks police to produce ‘abducted’ DMK councillor,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Madras high court

MADURAI: Madras high court has directed police officials to produce before the court on Thursday the DMK councillor of ward 8 in Mudukulathur panchayat union who was allegedly abducted. The order was given on a habeas corpus petition filed by the councillor’s son S Raja, a resident of Ramanathapuram district.

He said his father Sathaiah had contested the recent local body election on December 30 for the councillor’s post as a DMK candidate and won. After the results on Januray 2, his father returned to his house at Vaithiyanenthal. The next day, he went out around 5 am after informing his mother that he was going to meet some friends. However, he did not return and when his mother contacted him over phone, he informed her that he had been abducted and detained by four people.

Raja said when he came to know about the incident, he immediately informed the inspector of Mudukulathur police station and sought steps to rescue his father. However, there was no response. He further stated that his father was brought by the people to the block development office for the swearing-in ceremony on January 6 but was taken away after that. He said that four “highly influential” people had detained his father to prevent him from voting to elect the chairman of Mudukulathur panchayat union on January 11.

Though he and members of DMK lodged a complaint at the police station, the officials merely registered a community service register, which prompted him to the habeas corpus petition. When the petition was heard on Wednesday, a division bench of Justice T Raja and Justice B Pugalendhi directed the police officials to produce the petitioner’s father before the court on January 9 failing which the Ramanathapuram superintendent of police should appear before the court to explain about the status of the case.

Shyam Sundar Paliwal, former sarpanch of Piplantri addressing students at Parul University

VADODARA: If more villages take a leaf out of this Rajasthan hamlet, rural India will not only make their surroundings green but also help their ‘betis’ live and prosper.

Narrating the story of how he changed a personal tragedy into a common good for his village of Piplantri in Rajasthan’s Rajsamand district , social activist and former sarpanch , Shyam Sundar Paliwal, said that it’s the people’s will that ushers in the change.

Paliwal had lost his daughter Kiran in 2007. He turned his grief into an opportunity to save girl child in his village. He started the ‘Kiran Nidhi Yojana’ — a scheme that starts with the birth of a girl child.

Whenever a girl is born in this village, 111 trees are planted. A fixed deposit of Rs 31,000 is also made with the family contributing Rs 10,000 and the rest by the NGO, the panchayat and other villagers.

On every Raksha Bandhan , a thread is tied to the saplings and nurtured, and are treated like they are part of the family, and the tribe of family trees in the region is only growing.

“We had started the initiative to ensure that the girl’s family has enough money to ensure that she can pursue higher education and also save for her wedding,” said Paliwal, who was in the city on Wednesday to interact with students and staff of Faculty of Social Work of city-based Parul University (PU).

Paliwal also interacted with sarpanches of villages in and around Vadodara under PUTalks inspiring them to take steps that can ensure holistic development of their villages.

Paliwal’s efforts have helped Piplantri turn into a model self-sustainable village where women self-help groups have planted aloe vera, bamboo and rose plants among others which are used to manufacture products that generate employment at the local level.

The village with a population of 5,500 residents has ensured employment generation for nearly 1,200 residents and thus arresting migration towards bigger cities.

Taking suo-motu cognizance, the court directed the commission to produce the CCTV footages before the registrar (judicial) of the court before 5 pm on January 3.

When the petition was heard on Wednesday, a division bench of Justices M Duraiswamy and T Ravindran observed that the SEC had filed a miscellaneous petition seeking extension of 15 days’ time to submit the footage. The judges observed that the election results were declared on January 2 and 3 and the reason furnished by the commission cannot be accepted and no further indulgence can be shown.

Vijayawada: Expressing anguish about the death of 10 farmers in the capital city area, TDP national general secretary Lokesh asked chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy should go on Odarpu Yatra to meet the family members of the deceased.

He said even district-in-charge ministers were not meeting the kin of the farmers who lost lives due to the government’s plans to shift the capital from Amaravati. Lokesh consoled the family members of Addepalli Kripanandam, farmer of Krishnayapalem village in the capital city, who died of heart-attack on Wednesday. Lokesh also participated in the funeral rally of the farmer in the village.

Speaking to media, Lokesh criticized the government for not responding to the death of farmers in the capital. “Several people are losing their lives out of shock after the government declared its intention to shift the capital. How can any government be so insensitive to the woes of the people,” asked Lokesh.

He dared the ministers to visit the villages to gauge people’s mood. He said that no one in the 29 villages was happy after the chief minister revealed the proposal to shift the capital city. He slammed the government for ignoring the sacrifices of farmers who parted with their land for the capital city.

He said farmers were sleepless for past several weeks due to the illogical decision of the government. He said Jagan was trying to repay his debts to KCR by abandoning the capital city.

Earlier in the day, Lokesh visited the district prison in Guntur and met the farmers who were arrested. Lokesh assured the farmers all assistance from TDP.

NAGPUR: The daylong Bharat bandh called by the Left and Congress backed trade unions affected work in a number of central and state government offices in the city. For the first time, they had the support of Shiv Sena-backed Kamgar Sena, a right wing outfit. Though the main demands were about labour issues, the union leaders also expressed solidarity with JNU students during the rally.

Sangh Parivar affiliated Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) did not take part in the strike on the grounds that the other unions were also raising political issues like NRC, CAA and the JNU case. The strike was also supported by smaller associations, ranging from class four employees in Government Mental Hospital in the city, nurses in government medical colleges, ASHA workers and medical representatives.

The main demand of the smaller unions was wage hike and better work conditions. The majority unions in public sector undertaking (PSU) banks, except State Bank of India, were also on strike. The unions also raised the issue of problems faced by BSNL, however employees in the state-owned telecom service provider did not take part in the strike.

The major organizations where the strike affected work include income tax department, Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), government-owned general insurance companies, department of posts, and a number of state government offices like zilla parishad and health department, said Gurprit Singh, secretary of joint council of trade unions.

Singh said the unions are pressing for a 12-point charter of demands, which covers opposition to merging of major labour laws into four codes, scrapping of new pension scheme (NPS), merger of banks and insurance corporation, and disinvestment. Singh said the new labour codes will also bring down minimum wage structure as the laws will become state subject.

After representatives of smaller unions raised their issues, mainly related to increase in wages, the senior leaders also made a mention about the developments at JNU. Among the three resolutions passed after the strike included one expressing solidarity with the JNU students.

Political sentiment could also be felt in the strike. “The fascist government thinks it has only two enemies, Marx and Ambedkar, however, the government will not last long,” said a veteran trade union leader while winding up the protest rally.

All speakers also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the economic slowdown in the country. “Around 25 crore in all have hit the streets throughout the country. Had it been a developed country like Germany the prime minister would have quit,” said a union leader.

The bank unions took out a rally near Kingsway and have been protesting against a number of decisions, especially merger of PSU banks, said Jayant Gurwey of Eastern Maharashtra Bank Employees Association (EMBEA).

Cops haul away protesting candidates in Gandhinagar on Wednesday

AHMEDABAD: More than 100 women candidates who took the Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) examination were detained by police in Gandhinagar on Wednesday as they protested the exclusion from vacancies in the general category after the exam, which was held in January 2019. A large number of LRD women candidates have been protesting in Gandhinagar for the past 30 days.

Four protesters were injured, one of them grievously, when they attempted to evade detention by running away from police. The protesters were trying to march towards the state assembly despite not having the required permission. A protester, Pooja Sangathiya, has been admitted to hospital.

The women protesters who have been sitting on a dharna at Sector 6 in Gandhinagar have also approached the Gujarat high court with a petition against their exclusion. The protesting aspirants belong to reserved categories — SC, ST, and OBC — and are meritorious candidates, but are being denied the option of choosing vacancies in the general category.

The state government had, in August 2018, announced the examination to fill 9,713 LRD posts. Of these, 3,077 posts were reserved for women. The examination was held in January 2019 and the results were announced in November 2019.

Minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja said on Wednesday that the state government will ensure that no candidate faces injustice.

151,['9/01/2020'],Puri temple seeks more time from SC to list deities’ property,"This story is from January 9, 2020

BHUBANESWAR: The administration of the Jagannath Temple in Puri has sought more time from the Supreme Court to compile a complete database of the immovable property and quarries owned by the 12th-century shrine in Odisha and other states.

On November 4 last year, the Supreme Court had sought information on the temple’s immovable property and quarries while issuing 23 directives to the shrine administration on temple reforms.

Though amicus curiae Ranjit Kumar had earlier stated in his report that the temple owned 60,418 acres of land, the apex court had on November 4 ordered the temple to conduct an inventory to list other immovable property owned by the deities in the state and beyond. The court had also wanted to know about the utilization of the land owned and the income generated by it.

“At present, we do not have the complete information on the volume of temple land in various states. Efforts are being made to gather information from the states on the presence of temple land and whether those properties have or have not been acquired by the temple administration,” the temple’s senior counsel in the Supreme Court, Swetaketu Mishra, said.

Mishra said another affidavit would soon be filed in the Supreme Court detailing the immovable property of the temple as well as the status of quarry operations. “We were asked by the Supreme Court to furnish a report on the exact number of quarries operating on the temple land and whether those are managed properly. The court also wanted to know whether the quarries generate revenue for the temple. We have so far not compiled the complete list of quarries,” Mishra said.

The temple advocate said the amicus curiae would prepare a note on the loose ends in the temple’s affidavit. “We will rectify our flaws and fulfil the observations of the amicus curiae and the Supreme Court,” Mishra said.

The temple officials said most of the 23 directives by the Supreme Court had been complied with. “We have acted on the apex court’s directive and started a probe against some servitors who had disrupted the rituals of the temple on December 28, 2018,” a temple official said.

Representative image

BHUBANESWAR: The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation ( BMC ) has sold advertisement rights to two private parties for Rs 19.80 crore, the highest since the civic body had started auctioning advertising space in the city in 2008.

The rights include setting up hoardings, bill boards and sign boards on government lands, which have been designated as hoarding zones. The private parties can’t put up advertisements on no-hoarding zones and on rooftops as the BMC had put a blanket ban on it in 2017.

“We had kept a minimum auction amount (offset amount) of Rs 14 crore for the two zones. The two parties who quoted the highest for the respective zones was given the rights,” BMC deputy commissioner Srimanta Mishra said. He said this is the highest that the BMC will be earning from selling advertisement rights.

The BMC has been divided into three zones for administrative purposes and while two of the zones have earned it rich dividends, there was no bidder for the third zone. “We may go for sole auction of this zone. We expect to earn about Rs 5 crore from its sale,” said a BMC officer.

On November 21, 2013, the state government had come up with a resolution that advertisement should not be driven by revenue and it should rather be driven by city’s development needs and aesthetic value. Considering this, the BMC banned rooftop hoardings and also designated places as no hoarding zones.

BMC sources said besides the rights to put up advertisements on government land, the BMC also earns revenue from ‘advertisement licence fee’ for putting up hoardings and bill boards on private land.

NAMAKKAL: When her husband died 30 years ago, Pappathi, then a 31-year-old mother of three children, was staring at an uncertain future. Three decades later, Pappathi returned from Tumkur in Karnataka after receiving the Krishi Karman award from Prime minister Narendra Modi for managing a record yield in her farm.

With sheer grit and determination she took up farming in her small tract of land left behind by her husband Ponnusamy. She never had much of an experience in agriculture apart from helping her husband in minor chores like de-weeding.

Today, Pappathi has become a celebrity of sorts in her village and an inspiration for fellow farmers in neighbouring villages as well. From a nondescript Kunjampalayam village in Namakkal district , Pappathi got an yield of 1210 kg sesame in her one hectare land, about 200 kgs more than the normal yield.

“We used to cultivate different crops in our land. In 2018 we sowed sesame. One day agriculture department officials visited our farm and said they want to take stock of the yield. Soon after, they called me to inform that I have recorded the highest yield,’’ she said, beaming with pride.

Pappathi was not aware that she was going to receive the award from Modi. She received the award on January 2 at a grand function in Tumkur. Besides a citation, she was also given a cash reward of Rs 2 lakh.

Her elder son P Ramesh who helps Pappathi in agriculture, said that they do not use any chemical fertilisers.

“We followed the agriculture department officials’s advise to use organic fertiliser. Now many more farmers from the region are seeking our advise to increase yield,’’ he said.

AHMEDABAD: Cyber cell sleuths on Tuesday arrested Chintan Thakkar, 32, a resident of Mathak in Morbi and the owner of a fair price shop, in the public distribution system (PDS) fingerprint scam . Cyber cell sources said Thakkar and the prime accused Bharat Chudhary had met near Iskcon Crossroads in the city as part of the conspiracy. Thakkar is the 13th person accused arrested in the case.

DCP cyber cell Rajdeepsinh Jhala said Thakkar used to provide data to the scamsters, including the fingerprints of eligible beneficiaries who had not bought rations from fair price shops.

“The scamsters would replicate the beneficiaries’ fingerprints on a rubber-like material using a computer application, raise forged bills by fooling the biometric system, and sell the subsidized goods in the market at a higher price,” Jhala added.

The scam was carried out by three key persons, Bharat Chaudhary, 26; Dhaval Patel, 32, an electronics and communications engineer from Karamsad; and Dushyant Parmar, 22. They were arrested on December 7 and 8.

Cyber cell sleuths later arrested nine owners of fair price shops in Anand for their role in the scam based on the confessions of the principal accused. These owners were Rameshchandra Mohnani, 64; Joytaram Sargara, 38; Dilip Patel, 56; Manhar Solanki, 65; Vinod Vaghela, 43; Gangaram Vasava, 54; Chetan Tulsani, 42; Gangasagar Pandey, 38; and Praful Thakor, 62.

Jhala said the prime accused had colluded with more than 40 fair price shop owners. Other players from Gurugram, Sohna, Parval, Badshahpur and Mewat are also involved in the scam.

As soon as an unsuspecting Paytm customer enters his bank details, all his sensitive information reach the cheaters. For the next few minutes, the swindler keeps the Paytm user engaged in talks while his hard earned money is diverted to their accounts through multiple transactions. After the phone is disconnected, the customer finds he has messages of several transactions from the bank, but by then it is too late, the cops said.In his complaint, a Paytm user Bhusan Lal, a resident of Sector 49, reported that he received a call on January 5. The caller introduced himself as an employee of Paytm and asked him to update the KYC details, or else his wallet account would expire. Later, the complainant also received a message on his mobile phone to this effect. So, he called on the number. He was asked to download an app to update the KYC details. As he downloaded it and filled all his details online, the cheats allegedly withdrew a total of Rs 31,845 from his account, while he was kept engaged over phone.Another resident Deepak Kumar Rana of Sector 49 also stated that he had received an SMS to update his KYC, failing which his Paytm account would be blocked within 24 hours. Deepak called up at the given mobile number. The person responding introduced himself as Rahul Sharma, a Paytm employee. The complainant followed his all instructions, thus passing on all his bank account-related sensitive information to the fraudsters. After disconnecting the phone, Deepak realised that while he was busy talking to Rahul, the cheats had diverted Rs 44,980 in four transactions from his bank account linked to Paytm. So, he called his bank and got his account blocked, but the money was already gone.Both complainants has submitted their complaints to the public window at police headquarters, which forwarded those to the cyber cell for investigation.Devinder Singh, CCIC incharge of the UT police, said the cell has been flooded with complaints of frauds in the name of Paytm KYC update. They are getting two-three complaints every day, he said.He said that cheaters generally ask Paytm users to download apps like “Quick Viewer” and “Team Support”. “These apps are actually applications to remotely access your mobile phones. Once users enter their details in the app, fraudsters get full control of their devices. Next they ask customers to make a token payment from their debit or credit card to Paytm (to keep the account alive), which gives them all the required details to do online transactions.”The cyber cell unit of UT police has also written to Paytm to make their customers aware regarding fraudulent SMSs and calls, so that people do not fall prey to such fraud.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73164821,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-334842,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kyc-fraud-on-rise-55-plaints-in-15-days/articleshow/73162278.cms
156,['9/01/2020'],Madurai: Two declared winners-High Court extends stay on swearing in,"This story is from January 9, 2020

MADURAI: Madras high court has extended the interim injunction on swearing in a woman candidate as panchayat president of Sankarapuram village in Sivaganga district where election officials granted form 25, the certificate declaring the winner, to two candidates separately. The court also asked if the returning officer has the power to cancel form 25 issued to a candidate.

Petitioner M Devi and A Priyadharshini had contested for the post and form 25 was first issued to her after she was declared winner around 8 pm on January 2. However, she was shocked to know that Form 25 was later issued to Priyadharshini around 5 am on January 3. A division bench had heard her petition at a special sitting and observed that once the form is issued, the returning officer has no power to entertain the application for recounting as per rule 66 of Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994. Hence the court granted interim injunction on swearing in Priyadharshini as panchayat president.

When the case was heard on Wednesday, senior counsel for the petitioner submitted that it is illegal to cancel Form 25 after it is issued to a candidate and that it can only be done by the district court. Additional Advocate General K Chellapandian submitted that the election official had erroneously declared that Devi had won the election and issued Form 25 in her favour before the counting process was completed. He said that only 10,981 of the 11,924 votes polled were counted then. When the other candidate pointed this out, the remaining votes were counted and Priyadharshini was declared winner on completion of counting. The counter affidavit filed by the Sivaganga district collector stated that appropriate charges had been framed against the concerned returning officer and assistant returning officer calling for an explanation.

Taking note of the submissions, a division bench asked the government if the returning officer has the power to cancel Form 25 which has been issued to a candidate. The judges also observed that it is not known as to why the returning officer had taken the role of district court which has such powers to cancel Form 25 when a poll petition is filed under section 258 of TN Panchayats Act.

Representative image

KANPUR: An Army jawan was allegedly beaten up by a group of men from a particular community for raising religious slogan in Khanpur area under Sadar Kotwali police station in Auraiya district .

Both the sides have lodged FIRs against each other and police have launched a probe.

The police initiated action after a video of the incident, which took place on Monday, went viral on Wednesday.

“Armed with a licenced gun and 21 cartridges, Ram Naresh had gone to supervise construction work at his plot in Khanpur under Sadar Kotwali police station on Monday. A group of locals dialled Sadar Kotwali police station and informed that Ram Naresh, who was armed with a gun and cartridges, was raising religious slogan in an inebriated state,” said Inspector Sadar Kotwali Shashank Rajput.

“Sensing the gravity of the situation, a police team from Kotwali police station rushed to the spot. After preliminary investigation, the police booked Ram Naresh under sections 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the IPC,” he added.

However, Ram Naresh later filed a police complaint alleging that men from a particular community were herding cattle and attacked him when he stopped them. He also alleged that they snatched his rifle, cash and mobile phone.

“Acting on the jawan’s complaint, we have booked 11 persons under relevant sections, including 395 (punishment for dacoity), 504 and 506 of the IPC. A video has also surfaced on the social media showing a group of men heckling and attacking the jawan for chanting the religious slogan,” the Inspector added.

“Investigations are underway. Ram Naresh claims himself to be an Army jawan posted at Army headquarters in New Delhi. We are verifying his claims,” the inspector added.

158,['9/01/2020'],Water connection charges should be reduced: Activists,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Aurangabad: Activists and water experts staged a demonstration in front of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) headquarters to demand the reduction of the water tax to Rs 1,800 annually.

The AMC currently charges Rs 4,000 as water tax. They protested against the reported statement of the municipal commissioner that water charges would not be reduced till recovery reaches its 100% mark.

If the AMC staff could not recover more than 30 % of the water charges,The activists said that civic body chief should not force residents to pay for the lethargy of his staff,

The Aurangabad Samaji Manch and citizen’s action committee of water supply submitted a memorandum to the civic chief to draw his attention towards the problems of water supply, said professor Vijay Diwan.

Diwan had approached the high court challenging the civic body’s decision to go for the public-private partnership (PPP) model to implement the then Rs 792 crore parallel water supply system in 2006.

The AMC had eventually scrapped the contract with the private water company and then scrapped the scheme.

In 2011, the AMC mooted PPP model according to which the water supply was to be privatized for 20 years. the company didn’t start work between 2012 and 2014.

Diwan said that in 2011, residents would get daily water supply after paying Rs 1,800 annually. But after the company took over the residents would receive water supply six days in a month.

He added “We requested the municipal commissioner to provide daily water supply at Rs 1,800 for each domestic connection, and according to Bombay Municipal Act it’s the corporation’s responsibility to supply water, the civic body should not privatise it.’’ Senior CPI leader, Manohar Taksal, Madhukar Khillare, Devidas Kirtishahi and Subhash Lomte, social activist, led the demonstration.

160,['9/01/2020'],Nagpur: High Court judges to inspect Lonar lake on Febuary 1,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: The judges hearing a PIL on Lonar lake in the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court indicated on Wednesday that they may visit the historic crater on February 1 for spot inspection.

Before adjourning the hearing till February 14, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Milind Jadhav directed the counsels for petitioner and government to make a brief note on matters to be examined during the visit, and submit it to the court, a week earlier.

The directives came while hearing a plea (No 4549/2009) by lawyer Kirti Nipankar along with Govind Khekale and Sudhakar Bugdane from Buldhana, through counsel Anand Parchure, claiming that Lonar Lake was slowly degrading because of pollution and silting.

In the last hearing, the HC observed that the funds released to the forest department for clearance of weed around the lake was insufficient. “Recently, it has been discovered that the weeds have spread over larger area and therefore, more funds would be required. The additional funds, which are likely to be required, have been estimated roughly by the department at Rs363 lakh.”

Additional government pleader Deepak Thakre replied that the estimate is yet to be prepared and proper proposal for seeking sufficient funds would be drafted at the earliest. “We would request him to send the proposal as early as possible. On its receipt, the competent authority should report it the Buldhana collector, who would accord his approval and sanction to it.”

The MTDC then made a presentation for development of the area with a budget of Rs91.29 crore.

The forest department informed that a sewage treatment plant (STP) near the lake’s rim was not being run in a proper manner. It demanded that a pact between collector and Nashik-based Maharashtra Engineering and Research Institute (MERI) should be signed for its smooth running.

“We request the collector to make appropriate arrangement, if required with NEERI, to ensure that in no case smooth functioning of STP is hampered. It’s necessary in order to preserve the originality of lake water and area surrounding it. The citizens should be discouraged from any kind of open defecation, which has been found to be still continuing to some extent by the forest department,” the judges said.

They directed collector to take urgent steps in collaboration with Lonar Municipal Council and ensure that practice of open defecation is given up forthwith. “If any public toilets are required to be constructed, necessary funds for the purpose be released and it shall be ensured that they would have 24 hours water supply.”

161,['9/01/2020'],All-India bandh witnesses good response in city,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Aurangabad: Joining the nationwide bandh, private and public sector employees, trade unions and bankers marched to the divisional commissionerate to press for their demands, including reduction in central and state government taxes.

The bandh was called by the trade unions and employees’ federations to protest against the privatisation by government and ‘anti-labour’ policies of the central government.

The workers and employee unions coordination committee said that the all India federations of various workers and employee unions decided to observe the nationwide bandh demanding that the government reduce the state and the central government taxes, lower prices of essential commodities as well as take steps to reduce unemployment, said Uddhav Bhavalkar of Centre for India Trade Unions (CITU).

Bhavalkar said the march was peaceful and no untoward incident occurred during the nationwide strike in the city.

The protesters raised a number of issues and slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his failure to address real issues. They also raised slogans to highlight local issues such as the pending demands of Videocon workers who have not been paid salaries since a few months.

Bhavalkar said that a memorandum was also submitted to the prime minister through the divisional commissioner. The memorandum stated that despite making several representations, the prime minister and the central government failed address the long-pending issues of workers, employees and the common people. “We demand that the prime minister should hold discussions with the unions to address these issues,” he said.

The workers and employee organizations’ joint action committee has submitted a list of 15 demands that require urgent attention. The demand includes concrete steps to curb increasing unemployment and to ensure that there is no scarcity of work. They also demanded recruitment on 24 lakh vacant posts in the state and the central government departments as well as absorption in services of those who have worked on contract, daily wage or honorarium basis.

They also demanded that the labour laws that were made for the benefit of owners be changed and the labour laws be implemented strictly. They also demanded a process to register workers in unorganized sector and stop privatization of public sector undertakings, said Bhavalkar.

The bandh also saw active participation of bank employees and officials. Devidas Tuljapurkar, general secretary of Maharashtra State Bank Employees Federation, said that six major unions, including the AIBEA, BEFI, AIBOA, INBEF, which represent around 80% of employees and 30% officers, too participated in the strike. “We are also focusing on opposition to merger, stringent recovery measures, adequate recruitment and early wage settlement,” he said.

Tuljapurkar, a former director of the Bank of Maharashtra, said that except State Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank, the staff of all other banks participated in the bandh. He said across the Maharashtra, around 30,000 employees and 10,000 officers working in about 6,000 banks participated in the strike. These included 18 nationlised banks, 11 private sector banks and six foreign banks.

163,['9/01/2020'],Demand for inclusion of Tulu in 8th Schedule gets wheels,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Unique effort: Tulu script displayed on a city bus in Mangaluru

MANGALURU: A concerted campaign seeking inclusion of Tulu into the 8th Schedule of the Constitution , literally got its own set of wheels on Wednesday. This is thanks to the move by Dilraj Alva , owner of Sri Ganesh Prasad (SGP) buses that operate between State Bank terminus and Mangaladevi , in painting one of the SGP buses on route 27 with Tulu vowels and hashtags—#Tuluto8thschedule and #TuluofficiallnKA_K – supporting the campaign.

With Tulu predominantly spoken in this part of the state and in neighbouring Kasaragod in Kerala, Alva said this message being put on the bus will give the campaign a fresh lease of life. “We had a phase where those backing this demand did try out a Twitter campaign with the above hashtag, but it gradually lost momentum,” Alva told TOI, adding that the Tulu vowels and the above hashtags will remain on this bus to sustain the momentum for the above demand.

Displayed on the bus with the name ‘Irawata’, one of the five SGP buses that operate on route number 27, this is not for the first time that Alva has used his buses as a medium to spread the message on pressing issues. This experiment started five years ago when Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Swachh Bharat campaign, Alva said, adding he also dabbled with the message on the need to preserve and conserve water, when the city stared at a water crisis recently.

The Tulu vowels are on the bus that got a fresh coat of yellow and green paint for fitness certificate on Sunday, and were embossed on Tuesday night at the garage. Alva, one of the conveners of Swachh Mangaluru abhiyan that Ramakrishna Mission, Mangaluru, undertook for five years from 2015, said such messages tend to have the desired impact in that it evokes curiosity among various stakeholders and common people alike.

Alva incidentally does not limit his responsibility to fostering such social issues. He is among the first private bus operators in this city to introduce buses with wide middle door as per the urban bus body code that the ministry of road transport and highways mooted. All five SGP buses plying on route 27 are designed as per this code. Alva said he is happy at the positive feedback that this initiative of his has evoked.

In a petition to the district collector, she also sought CCTV cameras to be installed at her house and panchayat office.

“Only the government hopes that dalits will be uplifted by reserving such panchayats. But to this day, people from the BC community want to use us as puppets and take control of the panchayat administration,” she told TOI. However she admits that many non-dalits too would have cast their votes for her. The widow who grazes cattle for a living had unsuccessfully contested the panchayat president polls thrice in the last 33 years. Nagalakshmi secured 2,021 of the 5,600 votes polled and won by a margin of close to 300 votes. She said that till 11 pm on January 5 they were busy installing tent for oath taking the following day.

NAMAKKAL: A non-governmental organisation, Patthu Rubai Iyakkam, on Wednesday petitioned the district administration seeking action against authorities who had allegedly misappropriated several crores in implementing the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee ( MGNREGA ) scheme in the district.

“As per information obtained under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, we learned that the social audits carried out in villages across the state have revealed discrepancies in the records maintained for the scheme. Hence, the authorities have misappropriated several crores,” the petitioner and general secretary of Patthu Rubai Iyakkam Nalvinai Viswaraj said. The scheme was meant to ensure employment for underprivileged people for 100 days.

Various works from planting tree saplings, desilting water bodies and building micro checkdams were undertaken under the scheme. “For instance, if they plant 10 tree saplings, they would have recorded that 1,000 tree saplings were planted. Similarly, they have recorded exaggerated figures in many other development works in the scheme,” he added.

“Block resource persons should audit the records every year. We have obtained audit reports for the last three financial years for the districts across the state, and we could see several crores have been misappropriated,” he said. “Huge misappropriation of funds in the scheme could be unearthed if proper inquiry is conducted by the government ,” he added. Namakkal DRDA project director Malarvizhi said, “We are yet to get the petition from the district administration. We will conduct a thorough probe.""

Aurangabad: Noted economist and former member of the state planning board HM Desarda on Wednesday urged the government to adopt alternative development paradigm to ensure an equitable and sustainable pathway for the well-being of the farming community of Marathwada as well as the entire state.

He mentioned that the announcement of a loan waiver won’t completely bail out the farmers from the debt burden. “The most horrible trap is that of private unlicensed money lenders, input suppliers and such other elements who continue to exploit the farmers. The government has to take a firm stand on them,” he said.

Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, Desarda said that land rights should be restricted only to those who actually toil on the soil. “Currently 60 percent of the land ownership vests in those who do not physically work on the farm. For this the government should bring legislation to grant land ownership or tenure rights only to those who actually sow and harvest the crop,” he said.

He said that he has made a representation to the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on the same issue. He has insisted the government carry out a land-use census survey of the entire geographical area of Maharashtra state. He also pointed out that area under the forest shown in the government record is 52 lakh hectares was highly inflated. For example, he said, in Marathwada districts, the forest area was less than 3 percent. This is the root cause of the agrarian, droughts and other calamities, the economist said.

He urged the government to resolve the issue in a scientific way. “The Thackeray government should set up Maharashtra ecology, environment, forest, and climate the commission,’ with independent experts from diverse disciplines.”

Although, Maharashtra is one of the richest states of India, the record of the state in Human development is poor also the percentage of people living in slums is disproportionately high.

In his petition, Kannan stated the Melapalayam police in Tirunelveli district registered a case against him under Sections 504, 505(1)(b), 505(ii), 153 A, 506 (i) of the IPC.

According to the prosecution, while participating in a meeting organised by the SDPI party to condemn the Citizenship Amendment Act at Tirunelveli on December 29, 2019, Kannan had delivered the provocative speech by using specific words against the Prime Minister and home minister.

Kannan said the prosecution’s case is entirely misconceived as he was using a colloquial term in his speech and it was not his intention to affect any community or religious group but was only to voice for the aggrieved people.

He stated that the police without conducting any preliminary investigation had registered an FIR against him. Hence, he moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to quash the FIR. The petition is likely to be taken up for hearing soon.

It maybe recalled that following protests staged by BJP functionaries across the state, Kannan was arrested in this case recently.

New Delhi: A person was killed and three others were injured after a speeding trolley truck ran over them while they were asleep on the footpath in southeast Delhi’s Modi Mill flyover area late on Wednesday night.

According to the police, the incident occurred around 1.30am under the Modi Mill flyover where a group of people were sleeping.

The trolley driver, who was speeding, broke the grills on the footpath side and ran over them.

The deceased has been identified as Lalan (55) who was stuck under the wheels of the truck. The three others injured were identified as 60-year-old Banwati, her husband Aadi, and their son Vikas, who were rushed to the hospital. The truck driver had fled by the time the police reached the spot.

Since Lalan was stuck under the wheel of the truck, a crane had to be called for the truck to be lifted for them to take him to the hospital.

However, by the time he was taken out, he had died.

Another damaged car was found behind the truck. The driver of the car, who was present during the incident, told the police that he was taking a turn and since there were no lights, he could not see the truck and rammed it from behind.

171,['9/01/2020'],Everybody free to express opinion: Prakash Javadekar,"This story is from January 9, 2020

NEW DELHI: Amid calls, including at least one from a BJP functionary, to boycott Bollywood star Deepika Padukone 's upcoming movie ""Chhapaak"" for her visit to JNU, information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said on Wednesday that not just artistes, even a common man can go anywhere to express their opinion and there should be no objections to anyone expressing his opinion.

Nobody objected to such expression of opinions, Javadekar told reporters when asked during a Cabinet briefing here on Padukone's visit to the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Tuesday to express solidarity with the students who were attacked by a mob.

""This country is a democracy. Why only artistes, even a common man can go anywhere and express his opinion,"" the minister said.

About the call given by some party functionaries to boycott her upcoming movie, the minister said, he had not read their remarks but sought to underscore the significance of his statement, saying he is stating so as a minister and a ""permanent"" BJP spokesperson.

The minister's statement came in the backdrop of attacks on the actor by BJP functionary Tejinder Singh Bagga who called for the boycott of her soon-to-be launched film "" Chhapak"" for siding with the leader of "" tukde tukde gang "", an allusion to the presence by her side of of CPI functionary Kanhaiya Kumar along with Umar Khalid and others accused of raising slogans seeking country's dismemberment.

While Bagga emphasised that Padukone's presence at JNU on Sunday at a gathering of leftist students was a partisan act, pro- Hindutva tweeter handles circulated footage of her Doordarshan interview of 2011 where she had endorsed Rahul Gandhi as PM. The saffronite handles also circulated a tweet purportedly posted by Pakistan army spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor using his personal handle: "" Kudos@ Deepika Padukone for standing both with youth and the truth. You have proved to be a brave person in difficult environment earning respect. Humanity is everything,"" Ghafoor tweeted.

Ghafoor later deleted the tweet.

The director of Chhapak also attracted attacks for misrepresenting the faith of the man who carried out the acid attack on Lakshmi , the unfortunate girl played by Deepika on screen.

Her spouse Ranvir Singh became a collateral victim of the right-wing fury with twitter handles circulating her picture with UK businessman of Pakistani descent, Aneel Musarrat, who is an active member of Pakistan PM Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. The handles circulated the photographs of Musarrat, who organised fund raisers for PTI, with Imran Khan, Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and Major General Asif Ghafoor.

MADURAI: The nation-wide strike called by trade unions passed off without any untoward incidents in Madurai city. Demonstrations at various places by various organisations and political parties marked the day. Although a few sectors such as banking were impacted due to the protest, normal life of people was not affected in the city.

Most of the commercial establishments remained open as usual. In the commercial areas, around 10% shop owners closed their shops to show their solidarity to the bandh . Public transport was not affected as most of the auto rickshaws and city buses operated as usual. More than 2,000 policemen were deployed at various places across the city to avert any untoward incidents. Hundreds of people belonging to all trade unions attempted to block train at Madurai railway junction. A large number of police personnel posted there prevented them from entering the terminal. Protestors raised slogans against the central government for privatization of public sector undertakings, ‘anti workers policy’, price rise of essential items and sale of Air India.

A group of workers staged a protest in front of Life Insurance Corporation in West Veli Street. Services in banks, LIC, postal and insurance sectors were affected as employees in the sectors took part in the protest. A group of protestors attached to Jacto-Geo too staged a protest at Madurai district collector office. A large number of members from trade unions, CPM, CPI and DYFI took part in the protest that took place at Thamukkam. Madurai MP Su Venkatesan took part in the protest. Police arrested the protesters and released them later.

Protests also took place at Thiruparankundram bus stand and Thiruparankundram railway station. Madurai city police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham said that adequate precautionary measures were taken to maintain law and order. Any untoward incident was not recorded in Madurai city, he said. Protests by various trade unions and the opposition parties did not affect normal life in the southern districts as shops were open and buses and auto rickshaws operated as usual.

However, the bandh had an impact on the areas near the Kerala border due to the hartal that was strongly observed in the neighbouring state. Impact of the bandh could be felt at the bordering towns of Kaliyakkavilai in Kanyakumari district and at Puliyarai in Tenkasi district. Buses and vehicles were not operated in Kerala. Auto rickshaws drivers affiliated to communist trade unions did not work. Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) and private buses operated from various parts of the state to Thiruvananthapuram and other parts of Kerala were stopped at Kaliyakkavilai. This affected students and employees travelling from Kerala to Kanyakumari on a daily-basis as they had a tough time reaching the border. Students and employees travelling from Tamil Nadu to Kerala had less to worry as the bandh resulted in closure of institutions in Kerala on Wednesday.

At Puliyarai, buses were stopped ahead of the border in Tamil Nadu. Movement of goods vehicles between the two states was also affected.

Aurangabad: Different stakeholders from the tourism industry are looking forward to the first visit of Uddhav Thackeray to the city as the chief minister.

In a memorandum drafted by advocacy group ‘Aurangabad First’, the stakeholders have listed out pending and new demands. The memorandum will be handed over to him during the visit on Thursday. There is speculation that Uddhav’s son Aaditya, who is the minister for tourism and environment, may accompany him.

“Aurangabad district has a rich history, culture and heritage. The Unesco world heritage sites of Ellora and Ajanta attract national and international tourists to the city. The city itself has been declared the tourism capital of Maharashtra. However, the tag has not brought the necessary benefits or infrastructure yet,” Mansingh Pawar of Aurangabad First said.

Pointing to the dismal condition of city roads, non-existing footpaths, lack of proper signages along roads, poor garbage collection, the advocacy group said better efforts need to be taken to boost tourism. “Overall, the scenario is depressing. The tourism industry is passing through a difficult phase,” the group members said.

The group has pointed out that Aurangabad was to be included in the central scheme of HRIDAY, meant to conserve heritage sites in historical cities but it has not happened.

While Ajanta and Ellora have been included in the ‘Iconic Sites’ project by the government, but the work is not started yet. The advocacy group has demanded the state government should take initiative in the project and request the Centre to give funds for maintenance, conservation of these caves.

“The government must also encourage heritage walks and a proposal of developing ‘Aurangabad Haat’ in old city area be considered on a priority basis,” Pawar said.

The group wants the government to start special tourism courses in colleges and ITIs and setting up of a tourism directorate in Aurangabad.

Nagpur: In a rare gesture, a 47-year-old farmer from a remote village in Bhandara district saved life of his 44-year-old wife by donating his kidney to her. It’s a first such case at Super Specialty Hospital (SSH) where the procedure was performed.

The couple is now recovering well post-surgery and will be discharged soon.

In India, 80-85% donors for live renal transplant are women and 80-85% recipients are males. Kidney transplant specialist Dr Sanjay Kolte who performed the surgery said that in this case Rajesh was willing to donate kidney to his wife. Luckily their blood groups and other parameters also matched, he said.

“Blood relatives are the first to be approached for the live renal transplant. In this case, as the husband was willing to donate kidney, we decided to check the parameters,” said Dr Kolte.

He added that people having ‘O’ blood type can donate kidney to anyone. The Rh factor (+ or -) of blood does not matter in a transplant.

Rajesh, who is recovering fast, said that he has saved not only his wife but also entire family by donating kidney. “We have three daughters besides his elderly mother to take care of. My wife has been my companion in all ups and downs we faced over all these years. I only did my duty,” he said adding that his daughters are waiting eagerly to welcome their mother.

According to doctors, Laxmi must have been suffering from kidney disease from several years but she reported to SSH in June 2019 when the pain became unbearable.

“It’s unfortunate that women in rural India neglect their ailment until it becomes unbearable. Treatment becomes difficult if the ailment is at serious stage. Laxmi is lucky to have a husband like Rajesh. It’s quite rare for male patients to donate kidneys in our society,” said Dr Dhananjay Ookalkar, patron of Central India Nephrology Society.

Besides Dr Kolte, the team that performed the surgery included Dr Sameer Choube, HoD of Nephrology Dr Charulata Bawankule, and HOD of Urology Department Dr Dhananjay Selukar. They were guided by GMCH dean Dr Sajal Mitra and special executive officer Dr Milind Fulpatil.

Aurangabad: The Confederation of Medical Associations of Asia and Oceania (CMAAO) has cautioned people travelling to China, asking them to avoid contact with animals and sick people as the country is grappling with a mystery pneumonia outbreak.

In an official release issued on Wednesday, CMAAO president KK Aggarwal has said that the viral illness was first reported last week in Wuhan, a central Chinese city with a population of over 11 million.

“The viral illness has grown to at least 59 cases. Though, Chinese health officials have ruled out a resurgence of the highly contagious SARS virus, which killed hundreds more than a decade ago, one should be aware and exercise precautions,” he said.

Aggarwal, who is also former president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), advised travelers to seek medical care if they fell sick after travelling to Wuhan.

According to CMAAO, Taiwan’s centre for disease control has also advised residents planning to travel to or near Wuhan to wear masks and avoid contact with wild animals. The advisory to this effect was said to be issued early this week.

“All are being treated in quarantine and no obvious evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found so far,” CMAAO has said.

The outbreak of pneumonia in China comes just a few weeks before the country’s busiest travel season of the year, when millions travel there for Lunar New Year.

Currently, with 18 National Medical Associations (NMAs) as its members, the CMAAO is a 50-year-old body that aims to promote academic exchange and cultivate ties of friendship between member associations.

Kochi: The nationwide strike called by trade unions was total in Ernakulam district with Kunnathunadu police registering two cases for instances of violence.

A 70-year-old merchant, Poulose Kurian, sustained a minor fracture to his finger when supporters of the strike assaulted him and forced him to shut shop. A case has been registered against four unnamed persons.

In the second incident, a restaurateur sustained a concussion when protesters approached his shop and his hand got caught between the doors in the melee that ensued.

The strike in the city was otherwise peaceful, public transport almost completely remained off the road. Shops, establishments and educational institutions were closed, and government offices reported very low attendance.

The KSRTC conducted restricted operations to Pampa from the south railway station as few staff turned up for duty. Over 70 services were operated for passengers reaching the railway station. The KSRTC depot at Ernakulam wore a deserted look. Police had deployed vehicles for operating circular city trips for passengers reaching railway stations.

Most private vehicles kept off the road as well. Metro and trains were the only public transport available. However, people had to use private vehicles to reach the airport, railway and Metro stations. Only a few autos and cabs were seen on the roads.

Kochi Metro operated services as usual from 6am. Though there was a drop in the number of passengers, the Metro still recorded a ridership of 35,120 by 7pm.

However, a few roadside shops remained open. “We are not against the strike but this shop is my only source of income. I couldn’t meet my day-to-day expenses without opening the shop,” said Vimal K, a tea shop owner near MG Road.

Most of the major shops, however, remained closed either due to lack of staff or due to shop owners volunteering to down shutters.

Mohammad Rikas, owner of a print shop in Vyttila, said “We are closed today because no employees reported for duty.”

Boat services were suspended as most workers were on strike.

The usually busy markets in Kochi bore a deserted look as workers skipped work and cargo vehicles remained off the road. Most of the fuel bunks in the city also were closed.

The joint coordination committee of trade unions which called the strike took out a protest march from the Town Hall to Kaloor at 9am followed by a meeting near Kaloor Metro station. Protest marches and meetings were held in various places across the district.

181,['9/01/2020'],Biometric attendance under DTE scanner,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Aurangabad: The state directorate of technical education (DTE) has sought status of biometric attendance devices in different government colleges coming under its jurisdiction.

Acting on the directives from the headquarters, the DTE regional office on Tuesday told the institutions to furnish the desired details in the stipulated format.

Government institutions offering degree and diploma in engineering and pharmacy streams have come under scanner over assessment of biometric attendance system.

“Educational institutions have been asked to send details like total number of employees, including non-teaching staff, total number of biometric attendance systems, functional systems and type of attendance being followed. The compiled data will be sent to the DTE head office,” a senior DTE official said.

It should be noted that the state government has asked for mandatory use of biometric attendance system in government establishments with effect from March 2011.

Earlier in 2009, Maharashtra government had issued a circular asking implementation of the biometric time and attendance system in all departments under state government in order to optimize resource utilization and enhance productivity.

A DTE official said that biometric attendance in government colleges are under scanner in the wake of suspicion that a section of institutions are still not complying with the rule.

“The traditional muster system of attendance was considered vulnerable to unwanted manipulation and therefore the government has introduced the biometric system. The new system is considered as most secure and convenient authentication tool. It is one of the most sophisticated ways of recording attendance of employees and maintaining the leave records and overall working environment,” he said.

The DTE has over 50 autonomous institutions under its jurisdiction across the state and only government-run institutes have been told to furnish the details related to biometric attendance system.

Educational activist Sunil Rathod said the DTE must show courage to take a stern action against colleges that are still evading the biometric attendance system.

“The new attendance system was made compulsory in 2011. If the government-run engineering and pharmacy colleges are still evading the reforms, action must be taken. The traditional system of attendance has a huge scope of manipulation and therefore reasons behind the reluctance by colleges not to opt for the new system is also a reason for investigation,” he said.

The hospital administration attributed the rise in blood donation to the active participation of charitable and social organizations.“The rise in blood collection through voluntary donation has been consistent over the years at our hospital’s blood bank . Instead of relying too much on people to come forward, we started approaching them to motivate and counsel them to donate blood.

All these efforts are paying off now. We need about 24,000 blood bags in a year to cater to the patients in need. We aim to achieve this target in 2020,” he said.Desale has been donating blood for the last 14 years. “I donate blood about two to three times in a year. On January 1 every year, I begin the work of the blood bank by donating blood. My daughter, who turned 18 on January 3 this year, also donated blood,” he added.Sant Nirankari Charitable Foundation, Robin Hood Army and College of Engineering Pune, were some of the organizations that helped the hospital in 2019. The administration said VIT College, Balaji University and Bharat Forge also chipped in.Mangesh Badad, the media coordinator of Sant Nirankari Charitable Foundation, said, “Around 80% of the blood collected from the camps organized by our charitable foundation was from our members and followers. The remaining 20% was from people who joined these camps because of our persistent work throughout the year. In 2019, we had organized 30 blood donation camps. We aim to hold 35 camps this year.”Leena Nakate, the hospital’s blood transfusion expert, said, “As blood cannot be stored for a long period of time and there is a continuous demand for it, it should be donated regularly.”Experts said children with severe anaemia, often resulting from malaria or malnutrition, also need blood, besides people with severe trauma following accidents, cancer patients and the ones undergoing various surgeries. “Regular blood transfusion is needed for people with conditions such as Thalassaemia and Sickle Cell disease. The donated blood is also used to make products, such as clotting factors for people with Haemophilia,” Nalini Kadgi, the in-charge of the hospital’s blood bank, said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73164907,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-131560,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/donation-of-21-3k-blood-bags-in-2019-at-sassoon-benefit-over-47k-patients/articleshow/73163264.cms

Amita Dalal

Sitar stalwart Ustad Shahid Parvez set the course for Jogeshwari. Vidhwan Kumaresh, the violin maestro, had never played that raga. So when their collaboration began on Tuesday, Day 7 of Saptak, Vidhwan Kumaresh had to be guided not by practice but by premonitions. He had to anticipate the twists that lay ahead in his exploration to launch delicate sashays. He had to foresee smooth passages where notes could vault and roll. He had to modulate his virtuoso energies so that he and the ustad could reach the destination together.

Judging by the rasikas’ shouts of joy and praise, Vidhwan Kumaresh had taken them on a journey through the scenic route lined by lush instincts. “When I met ustadji before the concert, he suggested that we play Jogeshwari because this is Pandit Ravi Shankarji’s birth centenary year,” Vidhwan Kumaresh told TOI. “We don’t have an equivalent raga in Carnatic music. But a musician loves a challenge. I was able to play it because of the platform created by the masters.”

The young members of the audience had found elation in a spell of education. What can be done to attract more of them to classical concerts? Vidhwan Kumaresh said they shouldn’t bother about jargon. “Everybody enjoys musical moments, the melody content, the camaraderie between the artists, the parleys and exchanges, and the cries of ‘wah wah’…all these are part of the musical experience,” he said. On Tuesday, ‘wah wahs’ abounded at the venue.

At an earlier baithak, sitarist Amita Dalal essayed Shyam Kalyan. “I played a composition created by Dada Guru Pandit Ravi Shankarji,” Dalal told TOI. “I feel blessed to be a part of the legacy of Indian classical music with the guidance of my gurujis Vidushi Manju Mehta and Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt .” Another baithak featured Pandit Ulhas Kashalkar. The muses visit him from Gwalior, Agra, and Jaipur gharanas.

CHENNAI: Soon, you can walk or jog along the beach without fear of running into fast moving traffic. The city corporation has planned to lay a 2.5-km-long footpath along the seaward side of the Loop Road that stretches from the light house to Foreshore Estate to ensure such activities, additional advocate general S R Rajagopalan submitted before a division bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice R Suresh Kumar on Wednesday.

Producing a map of the stretch where the 4-ft-wide footpath is proposed, Rajagopalan informed the bench that the Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner had made a representation to the Tamil Nadu Costal Regulation Zone Management Authority in this regard and the project would commence once clearance is obtained. In addition to the footpath, fishermen would also be provided space to access the sea, he said.

Vendors of fish who currently occupy the seaward side of the road will be relocated to the market planned on a two-acre plot at Noichi Kuppam, he added.

Recording the submissions, the bench made it clear the court was not inclined to act against the interests of the fishing community and that it wanted the authorities to ensure it was provided with proper livelihood alternatives.

The bench then directed the corporation to obtain necessary approval and plan permission from the authorities concerned as expeditiously as possible so that it could undertake the construction in a speedy manner.

Separately, with regard to regulating hawking on the Marina beach, the additional advocate general informed the court that the civic body was in the process of preparing guidelines for allotting shops and providing vending carts to the identified vendors. “We can give a clear picture including the time required by January 22,” he added.

To this, counsel representing a group of vendors on the Marina submitted that at present at least 2-3 people from a family were involved in hawking on the beach whereas corporation has provided licence to only one person from each family.

Responding to the objection, Rajagopalan said that the authorities were in the process of hearing such objections and would come up with draft guidelines.

The bench then asked counsel for the vendors to forward their objections as representation to the corporation so that the authorities could consider the same and take a decision. It directed the corporation to produce the draft guidelines for allotment of identity cards to street vendors on the Marina by January 22.

Representative image

BAREILLY: Police have arrested a woman, identified as Moni from Bareilly ’s Sikalapur locality under Baradari police station, for practising exorcism , on Tuesday. Moni allegedly inflicted 101 cuts on her sister-in-law Renu’s body with the belief that it would cure her father’s ill health.

The police said that Moni’s husband Mooli and her brother Raju helped her in the act. Renu – in her 20s – required at least 300 stitches for the cuts on her face and other parts of body during treatment at a district hospital. Renu has been admitted to ICU where doctors said that she had over two dozen cuts on her face. The cops also said Moni, who is a local resident in her 30s, has been sent to jail and they are conducting raids to nab absconding Mooli and Raju.

Baradari police station officer inspector Naresh Tyagi said that following complaint filed by Renu’s brother an FIR under section 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC has been registered against three and they are investigating the matter. “We will record Renu’s statements in a day or two once she is stable and in a condition to talk to us. We have sent Moni to jail.”

Renu, a resident of Ganghora village under Bhojipura police station in Bareilly, was married to Sanjeev around eight years ago. It is learnt that his father-in-law, Jagdish, fell ill a few months ago.

“Accused Moni, who practice exorcism, decided to cure her father by initiating the act. Going by superstitious beliefs, they inflicted as many as 101 cuts on Renu’s face and body. It cannot be ruled out that they wanted to sacrifice her to complete the act,” police inspector said.

On Monday night, the accused had locked Renu’s husband and mother-in-law in another room who had tried to stop them from the crime. When the accused trio started inflicting cuts on Renu’s body, she struggled to get out of their clutches and somehow managed to escape from her house.

Upon reaching near Bareilly College, she collapsed and became unconscious. A police constable on patrol reportedly spotted her and she was taken to a district hospital. Once regaining her consciousness, she narrated her ordeal to the police who then informed her parents.

Aurangabad: The central authorities have issued directives to the urban local bodies for integrating informal waste pickers into the national-level cleanliness programme of Swachh Bharat Mission.

Civic authorities have been told to carry out the field level assessment and identify waste pickers across the city, followed by the enrolment drives to integrate informal waste pickers in the Solid Waste Management (SWM )system. Besides waste pickers, self-help groups will be also integrated into the central mission.

“The Centre has asked local bodies to make a cooperative organization of identified informal workers. It will help in the proper integration of this workforce and ensure accountability. The waste pickers, as a part of the desired integration, are expected to be roped into the door-to-door collection and transportation of waste,” a senior official from the AMC said

The urban local bodies have been asked to keep a ward-wise list of waste pickers with ID numbers. “The civic administrations have been specifically told to conduct training for them to ensure proper integration into the SWM system of urban local bodies,” civic authorities said.

The central authorities have also asked to count the services of informal waste pickers on the payroll. As per SWM Rules, 2016, urban local bodies are expected to establish a system to recognise organisations of waste pickers or informal waste collectors.

Natasha Zarine, a city-based solid waste management expert, said, “More emphasis is being given to this concept now. It is a win-win situation for society and waste pickers.”

MADURAI: The city police fitted 64 cameras in select city buses operated by the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), Madurai on bandh day to deter vandals from damaging the windshields. The city had witnessed damages caused to buses during hartals in the past.

City police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham told TOI that the idea was put forward by deputy commissioner of law and order E Karthick during a discussion for precautionary measures to be taken for the nation-wide bandh. They felt it as a good idea to be implemented and immediately started fitting cameras. They had utilised the existing cameras in their possession.

An official from the technical wing of the city police said the 64 cameras were installed in 32 buses, covering both sides of the front portion of the vehicles. The cameras are equipped with inbuilt storage system to recorded visuals, while the power was drawn from the buses, he said. Another police officer said that they selected buses from various bus depots and importance was given to routes, where damaging of buses was noticed during previous instances.

“The cameras installed on Tuesday evening were removed on Wednesday evening. Buses plying to outskirts like Avaniyapuram and Tirunagar were selected since vandals target government properties in such places. Moreover, such areas do not have many CCTV cameras, so vandals walk free after damaging windshields,” he said. So far, no other police unit has taken such an initiative and it was tested only on a pilot basis. Based on its outcome, it can be continued in future also, he added.

An official from the TNSTC said that when the police came up with such an idea, they found it novel and cooperated in every possible way as it will help protect their property.

Bareilly: Angry with assassination of Iran’s top General Qassim Suleimani, a poster of US president Donald Trump and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling them as “killers of humanity” has been pasted at the staircase of Aasfi Shia Jama Masjid in Bareilly. Shia Muslims in Bareilly have been protesting against the US drone strike since the Iranian general’s killing on Iraqi soil.

After prayers on Wednesday, locals stood on the two leaders’ poster and raised slogans against the US. Imam of Aasfi Shia Jama Masjid, Shamsul Hasan Khan, said, “The mosque committee has pasted the banner terming Trump and Netanyahu as killers of humanity following the murder of Iranian General Qassim Suleimani. The banner has been pasted on stairs so that people can walk all over it. US killed Suleimani due to their wrong policies. Shia community is upset with his killing and staging protests to raise the voice against injustice. Suleimani always worked for human rights and extended help to India.”

Appealing to government of India, Khan said, “Suleimani who spent his life in fighting against terrorism is being quoted as a terrorist by a few media platforms. We want the government of India to take action against such media platforms.”

Shameen Haider Zaidi, a retired principal, said, “We condemn the attack and killing of Suleimani. We will continue to raise our voice against atrocity.”

Shanu Kazmi, one of the protesters, said, “Shia community is mourning the assassination of one of the top Iranian general. We will intensify our protest to demand for justice. We will stage a mass protest on Friday.”

KOCHI: Even while the pilot survey conducted by the town and country planning department put the number of buildings violating Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms in Kochi Corporation and Maradu municipality at 93 and 41, respectively, the local bodies claim that the total doesn’t exceed single digits. As per the lists prepared by these bodies last month, there are just two violations within Kochi Corporation limits and only five in Maradu municipality limits.Following the Supreme Court verdict to demolish four apartment complexes for violating CRZ norms in Maradu, the state government constituted coastal district committees (CDCs), tasked with preparing reports of CRZ violations in the respective district. Authorities of local bodies where CRZ norms are applicable in the district had been asked to submit interim reports to the committee. Kochi Corporation and Maradu municipality prepared these lists as part of the third interim report which they sent to the CDCs.All ten CDCs are to submit their reports to the state government by January 12. The state government is expected to submit its report to the apex court. “The pilot survey put the number of suspected CRZ violations in Kochi Corporation at 93. But, the report sent to the coastal district committee states that the corporation could identify only two violations. Similarly, Maradu municipality has put the number at 5. There is an attempt on the part of authorities of local bodies to sabotage the process to identify CRZ violations. They are trying to let the offenders go scot-free,” said Nipun Cherian, coordinator, Chilavannoor Kayal Samrakshana Sangham.As per norms, the lists compiled by the CDCs should be announced, to elicit feedback and comments from the public. “On December 28, Ernakulam district collector on his FB page posted that the list of CRZ violations in the district has been uploaded. But the NIC website didn’t allow me to access it, citing technical snarls. Moreover, the district collector withdrew the post the very next day. The last date for the public to send their complaints or suggestions was December 31, 2019,” Cherian said.The pilot survey of high-rise buildings in Maradu municipality and Kochi Corporation was carried out on the direction of the district collector. “There may be many more buildings violating CRZ norms. It is the officials who prepared the list for submission to the committee,” mayor Soumini Jain said. Corporation secretary Anu RS said it was the engineering department which prepared the list. Superintending engineer Baburaj said that he hadn’t seen the report as it was prepared by the town planning department.At the same time, Maradu municipal chairperson Nadira said the report was prepared by officials and the technical details will be known only to them.

Representative image

PUNE: Balwadis, the pre-primary classes run by the state government, will soon be merged with the anganwadis.

The state education department issued a notification in this regard on January 4.

“The Balwadi schools have been asked to merge with the anganwadis in the state as the pre-primary education segment has been handed over to the women and child development department, which run the anganwadis,” Shailaja Darade, an officer at the state directorate of education, said.

The education department said classroom space for balwadis would be made available in the anganwadis.

The move has failed to cut ice with educationists and experts, who said a majority of the balwadi schools were located in the rural parts of the state and their merger with the anganwadis would benefit private operators, while leaving the enrolled students in the lurch. “Balwadi students from the rural pockets in the state will be forced to shift to nursery classes run by private operators,” an education expert said.

The notification also left the teachers from rural schools baffled. Raising major concerns over the move, the teachers said this was expected to encourage private players to open new schools in the rural areas.

Headmistress of a zilla parishad school Seema Bhagwat said, “There are very few balwadis left in the state. Though they have been doing well, their merger with anganwadis will jeopardise the education of the enrolled students. There are also concerns over the location and teaching practices in the new set-up. Some parents may be hesitant to send their children to anganwadis.”

Another teacher Vinodkumar Pol, said, “There are chances that the anganwadis, with which the balwadi schools are merged, may be located at distant places. Parents may not send their wards to anganwadis due to the distance. Eventually, some students might end up sitting at home.”

MADURAI: More than 50,000 food business operators (FBO) in Madurai district are operating without license, which is mandatory under Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ( FSSAI ), said designated officer for food safety, Madurai district, Dr S Somasundaram.

Addressing a large number of food business operators representing various sectors at a one-day orientation program on Wednesday, he explained about the legal aspects of FSSAI rules and regulations. The participants were sensitized on the importance of taking license, fair business practice and health issues consumers might undergo if the food is not prepared hygienically.

Officials say that of the estimated 75,000 FBOs in Madurai district, 12,000 FBOs have taken only registration certificate, which can be obtained by paying Rs 100, instead of a license. Only hawkers, whose sales is less than Rs 3,000 per day are allowed to use registration certificate. Those involved in production, processing, selling of food materials, including roadside eateries, hotels and grocery stores have to obtain license, said the food safety officials.

“When unintentional mistakes are found with the FBOs, they will attract lesser punishment if they have license. They will face stringent action like closure of shops and hefty fine and if they do not have a license,” Somasundaram said. Excessive use of colours can cause kidney problems to consumers. City hospitals have been witnessing increase in dialysis cases and other problems. Government Rajaji Hospital saw at least 4,611 dialysis cases in the month of October, 2019 alone, Somasundaram added.

Representative image

CHENNAI: Asserting that a cartel of doctors , pharma companies and diagnostic labs is fleecing patients in the country, the Madras high court on Wednesday took a suo motu notice of the practice of providing ‘commissions’ to doctors for promoting and prescribing their drugs.

A division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice P Velmurugan directed the Union health ministry, Union chemical and fertilizers ministry, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority and Medical Council of India to explain as to the action taken by them against doctors across in the country for violating the code of conduct and accepting gifts, travel facilities, hospitality, cash or monetary grant from pharmaceutical companies and allied health sector industries in the past five years.

The bench passed the order while expanding the scope of the plea moved by Fourrts (India) Labs Pvt Ltd – a pharmaceutical company challenging its income tax assessment. During the scrutiny of its assessment for 2012-13 the company admitted to a total income of Rs 14.69 crore and claimed deductions for Rs 5.45 crore towards licences and taxes and another Rs 42.81 lakh towards ‘sales and promotion expenses’ which includes payments made to doctors for promoting their drug.

Appalled over the submissions, the court said, “It is clear that even though accepting such commissions is prohibited under law, pharmaceutical companies are still promoting their drugs by providing gifts, travel facilities, hospitality, cash or monetary grant to doctors. It is also proved that drugs are overpriced illegally by the companies. It is shocking and surprising to note that the company claimed deduction from income tax for the amount spent towards sale promotion expenses as well as for licences and taxes.”

The bench then directed the authorities to answer to a series of questions including, the list of doctors who were paid by Fourrts, number of doctors prosecuted for violating the rule and accepting such gifts from 2009.

The court also wanted the authorities to answer as to the number of pharmaceutical companies that have been prosecuted for regulation of the drug pricing authority, number of pharma companies who have claimed tax deductions under ‘sale and promotions’ head, number of complaints received on over pricing of drugs, and amount recovered from pharma firms for over pricing.

This apart, the court has also directed the Union government to inform as to when a separate ministry for pharma and medical devices would be established as stated by the ministry of chemicals in February 2018 by January 20.

PUNE: As many as 25 associations of allottees from Pune, Mumbai and Thane have approached the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority for taking control of their stalled projects since January 1 this year.The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) had last year issued an order, stating that the registration of an incomplete project could be revoked if 51% members of the association of allottees gave their consent to choose another developer to complete the project.The order was issued under sections 7 and 8 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016. “We have received 25 applications from associations of allottees (AoA) to restart their stalled projects,” MahaRERA secretary Vasant Prabhu said.MahaRERA officials said the applications of stalled projects were received from Pune, Mumbai and Thane. “The move will benefit stressed project where the developer had not been able to complete the project due to paucity of funds or any other reason for long period of time,” a MahaRERA official said.While filing a complaint, the AOA needs to provide a declaration that complaints regarding the project are been pending with the authority. They also need to provide a list of all stakeholders with available contact details, including the competent authority, promoter, landowner, investor, architects, engineers, chartered accountant, banks listed in encumbrances certificate, and any third party interested in helping with the stressed projects.The first order in this regard was passed on October 22 last year, in case of DSK Sadaphuli project of 279 apartments. This project was announced in March 2013, with the promise of handing over the possession of flats to homebuyers by November 2015.The project was, however, delayed and was nearly 90% complete when the builder faced arrest and has been behind bars since February 2018. Seeing no progress in the project, the buyers approached consumer protection group Mumbai Grahak Panchayat, which guided them about sections 7 and 8 promulgated by MahaRERA.The 131 homebuyers from the project then filed an application seeking MahaRERA’s permission to complete the remaining work, and restrain the mortgagee from selling or creating third party rights in the project. MahaRERA appointed a resolution panel, comprising developer Niranjan Hiranandani, president of National Real Estate Development Council, and MGP chairperson Shirish Deshpande.

Pune: Homebuyers from various organisations across the country have filed multiple writ petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the recent amendment in the Indian Bankruptcy Code, setting a minimum threshold limit on the number of homebuyers for approaching the National Company Law Tribunal to start the liquidation process against a defaulting developer.

Abhay Upadhyay, the president of the Forum for People’s Collective Efforts, a consumers’ body that had highlighted the injustice on homebuyers through letters to the PMO office and social media, said, “The amendments have been brought despite severe objections. Now that the matter has moved to the Supreme Court (SC), we are hoping that the SC will take cognizance of this issue and issue necessary directives.”

Last month, the government brought in an amendment under the Indian Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to introduce a minimum threshold of 100 or 10% homebuyers, whichever is lower, for take a defaulting developer to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for starting the liquidation process. The government later came out with an ordinance to clear it. Prior to this amendment, even a single financial creditor, including a homebuyer, with claims of at least Rs1 lakh could move NCLT against a defaulting developer.

Advocate Aditya Parolia, Partner, PSP Legal, representing various homebuyers’ forum across India told TOI that the ordinance passed by the government was highly unfair, arbitrary and against the interest of the homebuyers.

“This ordinance seems to protect only the builders, who have failed to deliver houses for years. A homebuyer cannot be expected to search for such a huge number of people. The cases pending against the builders in NCLTs across the country will be automatically dismissed in the light of this ordinance,” he said.

Don't visuals of bleeding students and teachers shake you up? We can't sit on the fence any longer. Kudos to Deepika Padukone for showing up, and all those who spoke for speaking up. This is not the time to stay quiet."" Actor Varun Dhawan, who is touring Madhya Pradesh, called it a ""sad and dangerous situation"". He said, ""(I) Cannot stay neutral on such issues. It's dangerous and sad if masked people enter an educational institution and all this happens.""Director Vikramaditya Motwane tweeted, ""Deepika's stand is going to make a lot of young people question their parents, their peers and their government. Hopefully they'll go out and educate themselves. And not parrot everything authority tells them. She's a true hero."" Nimrat Kaur made a succinct comment, ""Leading from the front, the tallest Deepika Padukone.""Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap said: ""It ( Deepika's visit to JNU ) sends out a very strong message of not just being in solidarity but of feeling their pain without fear. A lot of people in the film industry don't do it because it might go against their business but Deepika has managed to negate that fear and give courage to many others who were probably waiting for someone else to take the lead."" Dismissing those who claimed Padukone's JNU visit was a publicity stunt, Kashyap said: ""It's an even bigger statement when she does it on the eve of her film's release. Anybody in the business will tell you it is hara-kiri, especially when you are also the producer of the film. She has a lot more at stake.""Nikkhil Advani, whose pinned tweet is a snapshot of Constitution, pointed out that Deepika was taking a bigger risk by expressing her solidarity as she is also producer of the film 'Chhapaak'. ""As producer today Deepika Padukone would've been standing in the preview theatres in Mumbai waiting to hear praise being showered on her maiden production. She instead chose to stand in solidarity with JNU students knowing fully well the ramifications of her actions. Respect.""Actress Chitrangda Singh posted a blend of religious symbols including along with a note saying, ""This is the country my father fought for. This is the country he raised me to believe in. Students are the backbone of this country. We can't go far by breaking them.""Earlier, Twinkle Khanna reacted to a report on the JNU attack saying, ""India, where cows seem to receive more protection than students, is also a country that now refuses to be cowed down. You can't oppress people with violence. There will be more protests, more strikes, more people on the street.""Actor Suniel Shetty condemned the attack in an interview to a film portal. He said, ""Absolute disaster. I could be Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian. I can be anybody from BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena, NCP or any other party. But I have no right to go into a temple of education and beat up the kids. You come wearing masks and call yourself men? If you are men why not roam openly? Whichever party has done it, it is not done. At the same time, some students might not be students, they might be protesters, putting up placards like 'Free Kashmir'. Kashmir was, is and will remain ours. I think these things should be very clear.""Meanwhile, Maharashtra minister Ashok Chavan endorsed Deepika's action saying, ""Whatever happened in JNU, anyone will speak against it. I do not see anything wrong in Padukone supporting the JNU protest.""",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73164340,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-101342/73164340.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/after-deepika-more-bwood-celebs-speak-up/articleshow/73164343.cms

MALAPPURAM: Three of the world’s 10 fastest-growing urban areas are in Kerala , according to a survey published by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), a sister company of The Economist.While Malappuram tops the list, Kozhikode ranks fourth and Kollam is in the 10th position. No other Indian city has made it to the top 10 on the list, based on the United Nation’s population data.According to the report, Malappuram recorded a 44.1% rise in population between 2015-2020, while Can Tho in Vietnam, ranking second on the list, saw its population increase by 36.7%. Suqian in China, which ranks third, recorded a 36.6 % growth in population and Kozhikode recorded a 34.5% rise in population. Kollam registered a 31.1 % growth in population during the same period.With a population growth rate of 30.2%, Kerala’s cultural capital Thrissur features at number 13. The two other Indian cities that figure on the list of 30 are Surat (26.7%) and Tirupur (26.1%).Mohanachandran Nair, professor and head of department demography, Kerala University, said there was nothing surprising about Malappuram securing the top position on the list as population growth was a defining feature of urbanization.“If 75% people in an area work in non-farming sector, we consider the region as urbanized. Urban areas across the state have been redefined after the 2011 census and the number of municipalities and towns increased,” he said.“Urban population in Malappuram was only 3 lakh in 2001 and it increased to 16 lakh in 2011. The whopping increase signals the swift growth of urbanization even a decade ago. The total number of urban areas in Kerala before 2011 was below 30. But the number increased to 48 after 2011 census as we redefined the town areas across the state.

The space outside SBI bank branch on NSC Bose Road has been illegally cordoned off

CHENNAI: Commercial complexes and public sector undertakings on NSC Bose Road opposite the Madras high court have ‘reserved’ parking spaces outside their buildings, much to the chagrin of visitors to the court complex.

Early in the day, parking spaces outside the Tamil Nadu State Apex Co-operative (TNSC) Bank building and State Bank of India (SBI) building are barricaded and other vehicles are not allowed to park there.

An official with the corporation’s Royapuram zone told ToI that parking spaces had not been let out to any particular building or organization and it was on a ‘first come, first served’ basis. A traffic policeman on duty outside Madras high court too told ToI that spaces were not earmarked for any particular building.

“The security guards of the buildings do not allow public to park vehicles on NSC Bose Road claiming that senior bank officials have to park their vehicles,” said a worker at an optical store nearby.

After the high court came down heavily on it for allowing hawking and parking of two-wheelers on the pavement along NSC Bose Road, the civic body raised bollards on some stretches to check parking. On Wednesday, ToI saw two-wheelers continued to be parked on pavements despite boards erected by the city corporation and the police. In front of the commercial complex adjacent to Armenian street, several two-wheelers were parked on the pavement and a temporary ramp had been put up.

“The menace has reduced. We will set up bollards to prevent two-wheeler entry from the approach roads of NSC Bose Road,” said an official with Royapuram Zone. Traffic on the stretch is always an issue as advocates and visitors to the high court too triple-park on the road, eating into the carriageway.

Harishankar Saxena, his close friend, critic and the editor of the book ‘Nirjharini’ written on Saroj’s work, said that Saroj had been suffering from memory loss for the past few months. Saroj is survived by two sons and a daughter.

Saroj was publicly last seen at a Kavi Sammelan organised by Bareilly Municipal Corporation in November 2016. Though, his last appearance was not less than a nightmare to him as a few audiences had started hooting as soon as he started reciting poems. However, he continued reciting the poems and once completed, he received a standing ovation. He had then said that the incident reflected the “decline in good audience”. It was his last stage show after which Saroj had stopped participating in Kavi Sammelan.

Saroj had penned two collections of his poetry – ‘Chandan Van Doob Gaya’ (1986) and ‘Bana Na Chitra Havaon Ka’ (2006).

Starting at the age of 16 in 1955, he was felicitated in 2006 with Sahitya Bhushan award by Uttar Pradesh Hindi Sansthan for his remarkable contribution in Hindi poetry.

The injured victims Nilesh Trishinge (26) from Hadapsar and the pillion rider Amit Jamble are undergoing treatment at separate private hospitals. Jamble’s condition is reported to be serious.

Trishinge, a hotel manager, and three other persons celebrated a friend’s birthday in a restaurant at Malwadi in Hadapsar on the night intervening January 5 and 6. Around 4am, Trishinge and Jamble left on a bike to Fatimanagar. Two of their friends were following them.

Investigating officer Prashant Thakre from Wanowrie police station said, “Trishinge, while passing near Kroma mall, suddenly applied brakes in the middle of the highway. The impact was such that his bike skid and a speeding light vehicle ran over Trishinge’s left hand and Jamble’s left leg, critically injuring them.”

Thakare added, “The two friends, who were following them, rushed them to a nearby hospital. The police received a call regarding a medico-legal case from the hospital around 6.30am. A police team rushed to the spot and launched investigations.”

“Trishinge could not give details of the spot where the accident took place since it was dark. He could not identify the vehicle that injured him and his friend.

In a petition to the district collector, she also sought CCTV cameras to be installed at her house and panchayat office.

“Only the government hopes that dalits will be uplifted by reserving such panchayats. But to this day, people from the BC community want to use us as puppets and take control of the panchayat administration,” she told TOI. However she admits that many non-dalits too would have cast their votes for her. The widow who grazes cattle for a living had unsuccessfully contested the panchayat president polls thrice in the last 33 years. “I have been contesting when the president post was not reserved. This time it was reserved for dalits and six of us including three women were in the fray. Intermediate caste Hindus had fielded three of them, but I won as the people know me as a long-time contestant and easily approachable,” she said.

Nagalakshmi secured 2,021 of the 5,600 votes polled and won by a margin of close to 300 votes. She said that till 11 pm on January 5 they were busy installing the tent for the oath taking the following day. Fearing threat from mischief mongers, she said they also petitioned the local police. However, early next morning she got news about the tent being torched.

Police registered a case under sections 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage) of the IPC

PUNE: This Valentine’s Day, roses will come at a premium. Last year’s prolonged monsoon and the unseasonal rain, along with the consistent cloud cover , have led to a decline in the production of the flowers in the state.Flower growers from the state said the demand for roses ahead of Valentine’s Day from the domestic market has grown and prices have gone up phenomenally. Low production is likely to impact the export of roses.Ramesh Patil, chief executive officer of Shrivardhan Biotech in Kondigre village in Kolhapur district, has 103 acres of polyhouses. He exports over a million roses every year to domestic and international markets. He said production has halved this year.The international market has already suffered and there is a huge demand for roses and prices have gone up in the local market, he added.“Every year, we get good profits from the international market. This year, the weather has affected the rose buds. Fungus and bacterial infection have affected the quality of roses. The long bud and stem fetches the best prices. If the roses are small, then our profits are down,” Patil told TOIAt present, the domestic market is fetching almost as much money as the international consignments, he said.Pravin Sharma, president of the Indian Society of Floriculture Professionals, said they hoped the weather condition would improve from the second week of January which in turn will boost market conditions.Both markets have a demand of around 10 million roses around Valentine’s Day. This year, there will be a demand-supply gap, he added.Low temperatures are required for roses to bloom late and stay fresh for exports. The society expects a decline in the exports this year in terms of volume and value as compared to last year.Prasad Dev, director of the flower growers’ association in Maharashtra, said changing weather has affected many farmers into rose cultivation in Nanded who have now shut down their polyhouses.Babaji Ghadge, a farmer from Rajgurunagar, said more roses were affected by the Downy mildew fungus this year and production has taken a hit.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73164885,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-731409,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/long-monsoon-warmer-winter-and-cloud-cover-rob-markets-of-red-roses/articleshow/73163340.cms

In the last few weeks, at least 80 street food vendors on Elliot’s beach were taught about food safety

CHENNAI: Hot bajjis served on beaches or crispy hot dosas had at roadside stalls are set to become safer to eat if regulators in the city have their way.

In the last few weeks, at least 80 street food vendors on Elliot’s beach were taught about the need for food safety, what the Food Safety and Standard Act expects out of every food business unit, violations and punishments. At the end of the day, vendors who attended the camp were given Food Safety Training & Certification (FoSTaC). “If we have at least one certified personnel in every unit we will improve food quality and also emphasise that they follow all rules,” said A Ramakrishnan, designated food safety officer, Chennai.

For instance, street vendors on the beach were taught about the reuse of oil and safe way to dispose cooking oil. They were taught the importance of hand wash, food preservation and how things they use and their surrounding should be clean, he said.

Street food vendors will be given basic guidance including catering services. Under the FoSTaC programme, the regulator plans to train staff in the organised as well as unorganised sector. For street food vendors, anganwadi workers and Amma canteen staff, the authority is raising funds from people for the course. “We will be rolling out day-long training programmes for vendors on Marina and staff of Amma canteens soon,” another senior official said.

The course offers 17 types of competence-based certification programmes — each of 8 to 12-hour hour duration spread over a couple of days. Street vendors and aganwadi workers were given the basic course and training manuals. Most of the staff were also taught about where and how they should source ingredients and how they can check quality of the ingredients difference between edible oil/ghee and the cheap ones that are made for lighting lamps at temples.

Several studies by doctors’ bodies and nutritionists have shown high volumes of Ecoli coliform, salmonella, shigella, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas, which are major causes of infections such as diarrhoea, typhoid, food poisoning, urinary tract infections and pneumonia.

PUNE: General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Command, Lt Gen SK Saini has written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking the release of GST funds to seven cantonments, including Pune, Khadki and Dehu Road.“Funds (must) be allocated as per the state finance commission’s recommendations,” the letter written on December 21 said. Apart from the three cantonments in Pune district, the state has cantonments in Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Deolali and Kamptee.As on date, the budgets of all the seven cantonment boards of Maharashtra are in the red. All taxes earned from commercial/rental properties located in cantonments are now not available to the cantonment boards for their own use, the letter stated.The central and the state finance commissions have recommended a share of funds for cantonment boards from various schemes. But these are not being received by the cantonment boards, the letter added.The cantonment boards are deemed to be a municipality as per the Constitution. Their source of revenue generation was to be akin to municipalities and all cantonment boards were self-sustaining till the introduction of GST, Saini said.“In the past, cantonments used to receive a share of octroi from the neighbouring municipal corporations, which formed considerable percentage of cantonment board budgets. Collection of octroi was abolished by the government of India throughout the country in April 2013. Local Body Tax was levied by cantonment boards but that too got subsumed in GST. The share of state GST, however, was not released by the state government to cantonment boards,” the letter stated.Senior officials from the office of the Director General Defence Estates, which controls the cantonments, elected members of cantonment boards, activists and local residents said the state government has been ‘ignoring’ the cantonments.“We have discussed it with the then defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman, finance minister Arun Jaitley and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis,” Priyanka Shirigiri, member of Pune Cantonment Board , said. “We have not been able to launch any new project,” Amit Kumar, PCB’s chief executive officer, added.Dehu Road Cantonment Board vice president P B Shelar said, “ Cantonment boards have limited sources of revenue. We cannot function smoothly.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73166614,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-163830,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lt-gen-saini-writes-to-thackeray-for-gst-share-of-seven-cantonments/articleshow/73163345.cms

The youths had climbed on a police van to make a TikTok video

TUTICORIN: Three youngsters, including two 17-year-olds, who made a TikTok video sitting on the bonnet of a police escort van in Tuticorin district, had a taste of policing as police engaged them in traffic regulation on Wednesday. Police said it was not punishment but an opportunity to help them understand the importance of policing.

The trio climbed on the bonnet of the van that was stationed in Caldwell Colony in the city on Tuesday. The van attached to the armed reserve unit of the district police was taken to a workshop at Caldwell Colony when the boys made the short video. One of them recorded it while the two others sat on the bonnet it and acted. The video was circulated on social media platforms on Tuesday night and it did not miss the attention of the police. On Wednesday morning, the three were inquired by the Tuticorin South police. It came to known that one of them is a BA English graduate from Munisamipuram while the two teenagers hailed from Levinjipuram.

Sporting orange reflective jackets, they assisted the traffic police in regulating traffic at the busy market area from 9am to 1pm. They were given snacks and lunch and asked them to come for a similar shift in the evening. One of them did not have a pair of slippers, and the police got him one.

“It is not punishment. It was their choice. The boys had expressed their willingness to be part of the police force. They said they had not intended to tarnish the image of the police by making the video. We gave them an opportunity to serve the public along with the police,” said deputy superintendent of police in Tuticorin town sub-division R Prakash.

Kiran Bedi

PUDUCHERRY: Chief minister V Narayanasamy, public works minister A Namassivayam and government whip R K R Anantharaman chose a government function on Wednesday to vent out ire on lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi .

Declaring open a new building to accommodate the village panchayat office in Ariyankuppam Commune on Wednesday, Narayanasamy, Namassivayam and Anantharaman accused Bedi of interfering in the day-to-day affairs of the elected government and posing several hindrances to the administration.

Narayanasamy said none of the governors or lieutenant governors in the country interfere in the administrative affairs of elected governments in the states and Union territories unlike Bedi in Puducherry. Bedi has been posing several hindrances on a daily basis to the elected government in Puducherry under the instigation of the BJP-led government in the Centre, he said.

He said the government has been forced to take the legal route to counter Bedi's interferences and expressed optimism that all the obstacles posed by the Centre and lieutenant governor will fade away by February this year.

""Bright days are ahead for Puducherry. All the sufferings, obstacles and hindrances will disappear. We know that the influence of 'sani' (Saturn) will be only for a brief period. The obstacles faced by the government will fade away by February,"" he said. Namassivayam said Bedi, who was projected as the chief ministerial candidate by the BJP in 2011 Delhi assembly polls and was rejected by the electorate, has been attempting to rule the Union territory of Puducherry sidelining the government elected by the people of Puducherry.

""A person, who cannot understand the requirements and sentiments of all kinds of people has been imposing several obstacles in implementing people welfare schemes. She has no right to do so. She is not an elected representative but appointed by the President. She was fielded as a chief ministerial candidate by the BJP in Delhi. She lost the polls and her deposit too. She was rejected by the people in Delhi has attempted to rule Puducherry,"" he said.

Anantharaman challenged Bedi to contest from an assembly constituency in Puducherry and win polls to serve the people of the Union territory. He also challenged Bedi to resign and contest polls to assembly in Delhi declared in February and win the polls to serve the people if she believes in Constitution of India and democracy.

212,['9/01/2020'],Nationwide strike of trade unions partially affects services at RTO,"This story is from January 9, 2020

An almost empty Pune RTO office on Wednesday.

PUNE: The nationwide strike of trade unions hit the services at the Regional Transport Office on Wednesday, compelling many people to leave the facility only to return another day to get their work done.

Processes like transfer of vehicle ownership and licence tests were hit partially. “I had to get a choice registration number for a new car that I have bought. I went to the RTO (Regional Transport Office) today (Wednesday), but my work couldn’t be completed because of the strike. Many employees were absent, and I couldn’t fill all the forms,” said Rajesh Kulkarni.

The online services were available mostly without any hiccups. “Most of the services provided by the RTO, like filing for appointments for driving tests and seeking registrations, have gone online. So, people filing for appointments didn’t face any issues,” said an RTO official.

Another official said, “There were some problems regarding the driving tests for licences, both learners’ as well as the permanent ones, and tests ascertaining the fitness of vehicles. Some procedures like transfer of vehicle ownership and acquiring no objection certificates were hampered in a major way as these required clerical staffers to be present.”

Kishore Raut, who had gone for his learners’ licence test, said, “The RTO office was practically empty. The tests were happening but after two batches, the exam suddenly stopped. It started again after a while but stopped again. I was able to take the test, but the wait was too long, and many couldn’t appear for the test. They were told to come back on Thursday,” he said.

While operations of the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) and the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) remained normal, there was close monitoring of the service.

“Instructions were given to the drivers to be careful. They were told to park the bus at a safe distance if they saw trouble and remain in touch with the depot managers. The passenger volume was a little thin as people were anticipating trouble,” an official with the MSRTC in Pune told TOI.

213,['9/01/2020'],DM: Proposal to replace collectorate bldg revived,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Old collectorate building

Varanasi: The proposals for replacement of around 200 years old collectorate building, constructed in 1820, and abhilekhagar (record room) close to it has been revived again. The PWD has been asked to prepare drawing and estimate of the new buildings. Initially this proposal had been made during Mulayam Singh Yadav government in 2006 and it was finally put on backburner in 2013.

Talking to TOI on Wednesday, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “The proposal for replacement of the collectorate building was made about three months ago and its preliminary drawing and design has also been received. The PWD has been asked to prepare final design and estimate of the proposed new building and submit it in maximum 15 days.” The Archaeological Survey of India is also being consulted to find out whether the building has any heritage value, he said.

On receiving the final design and estimate, the proposal will be forwarded to the state government for approval, said the DM adding that if the proposal is approved by the mid of February the government may sanction its budget in the next annual budget.

Initially, the proposal was floated in Samajwadi Party government’s regime in 2006 and a government order was issued on January 30, 2009 declaring the building unfit for use as it was found in a dilapidated state. The officials had forwarded a proposal of Rs 871 lakh for replacement of the building to the revenue board and government. However, even after the project was sanctioned, its funds were diverted to west UP district.

In December 2010, another proposal was sent to the government and the revenue board revised the budget of the project to Rs 725 lakh. But the government decided for re-examination of the proposal and the construction and designing section (CNDS) of UP Jal Nigam was asked to prepare a new detailed project report (DPR) keeping the actual requirements of the collectorate in view. The CNDS prepared new DPR of Rs 18.18 crore proposing a multi-storied building. But later the CNDS was ousted from the project and the Rajkiya Nirman Nigam (RNN) was engaged revising the budget to Rs 17.47 crore.

In October 2013, the then district magistrate Pranjal Yadav, citing the proposal worth Rs 17.47 crore as a waste of public money, mentioned that the existing building was strong and sufficient for the work. A huge sum of money was invested in facelift of the building.

Regarding the record room Sharma said that an estimate of Rs five crore has been prepared for its replacement by a completely furnished and CCTV network equipped building.

A proposal for new annexe of circuit house to add 60 new rooms in view of high inflow of VIPs is also in pipeline, said DM Kaushal Raj Sharma adding that this proposal is also being prepared by the PWD.

214,['9/01/2020'],"Hailstorm, rain in Bareilly cause waterlogging, traffic disruption","This story is from January 9, 2020

Bareilly: Heavy downpour accompanied with hailstorm lashed across Bareilly on Wednesday afternoon causing much inconvenience to road users. Many were left stranded.

Traffic in several city pockets, including Satellite road, Shyamganj, Quila, Choupla and Civil Lines, among other areas, was disrupted. The Met has predicted more hailstorm and rain in Bareilly and other parts of UP in the next 12 hours.

Small-sized hailstones covered up several city roads, forcing commuters to take shelter. Thereafter, heavy downpour lashed the city which continued till late evening, resulting in waterlogging in several areas such as Quila-Choupla road and Rampur Garden. However, no injuries were reported due to hailstorm or lightning.

According to Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), 20.3 mm of rainfall was recorded in Bareilly on Wednesday. The maximum temperature was at 16.6 degrees Celsius (four degrees below normal) while minimum was 11.5 degrees Celsius (four degrees above normal).

The maximum humidity stood at 100 per cent and minimum was 87 per cent. However, the weatherman said that they did not record hailstorm activity. On Tuesday, city had witnessed mild showers in the afternoon. The maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 17.6 degrees C and 11.5 degrees C, respectively.

Head of geography department, Bareilly College, Neeru Agarwal told TOI, “The change in weather is mainly due to western disturbances and fresh snowfall in Himalayan region, which has aggravated the cold conditions. The skies will remain generally cloudy throughout the day with light to moderate rainfall, thunderstorm or hail in coming days as the entire state is in the grip of cold wave.”

Soon after the rainfall, city roads were left submerged, throwing traffic out of gear. Areas worst hit with waterlogging were Choupla and its adjoining places, Quila, Kudeshiya road, parts of Rampur Garden and low lying areas such as Subhash Nagar, Madinath and parts of old city.

“The hailstorm in the city was surprising. Within moments, several city roads were seen covered with hail. Commuters on road were forced to take shelter in petrol pumps, roadside shops and eateries to save themselves. Hailstorm lasted for 20 minutes and thereafter, it started raining heavily. Traffic came to a halt, especially near prominent junctions such as Satellite, Choupla, where construction of flyover is underway,” said Akshay Agarwal, a resident of Rampur Garden.

The IMD has predicted further drop in both minimum and maximum temperatures with more rainfall, hailstorm and gusty winds expected in UP districts of Agra, Aligarh, Allahabad, Amethi, Ghaziabad, Baghpat, Gonda, Meerut, Rae Bareli, Mathura, Moradabad, Shagaranpur and Varanasi, in the next 12 hours.

The DMO said preventive measures have been undertaken in the area to prevent the further spread of the disease. As the disease is spread mostly through coughing and sneezing, those affected have been advised stay in their houses.

“There is no need for panic as most of the people have reported low-grade fever. We have asked those with fever to take rest and those who have other difficulties like breathing problems and associated complications to get admitted in a hospital,” the DMO said.

She said health department staff was undertaking house visits in the area as part of fever surveillance and are collecting contact details of students with fever to monitor them.

She said initially it was the high school students who reported fever but later on students from other classes including the upper primary section also reported illness.

Health department authorities said that family members of the students have been asked to exercise vigil to avoid contracting the disease.

“We have advised to use towels while coughing and sneezing and to wash hands frequently,” she added.

Thiruvananthapuram: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on Wednesday said he committed a big mistake by appointing T P Senkumar as state police chief. Talking to reporters here Chennithala said he bypassed seniority to make Senkumar police chief to favour a Malayali officer.

“Mahesh Kumar Singla was the senior-most officer then. He was bypassed to give the post to Senkumar since we preferred a Malayali police officer as DGP in-charge of law and order,” he said adding that he now regrets the decision. Chennitala was reacting to the political leniency shown by Senkumar after he got retired from the DGP post.

Senkumar had become a controversial figure by spitting communal venom through his social media handles and advocating the agenda of Sangh Parivar. “We are now facing consequences of making him the DGP of the state,’’ Chennithala said.

The UDF and opposition leader had advocated for T P Senkumar when the LDF had replaced him with Lokanth Behra. Senkumar had returned to the post through a court directive and the UDF backed him during this period. tnn

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan then had flayed the UDF and the opposition leader in particular for supporting Senkumar.

217,['9/01/2020'],Gujarat: Disturbed Areas Act amendment held back by MHA,"Representative image

GANDHINAGAR: The ministry of home affairs ( MHA ) has raised objections to certain key features of the Disturbed Areas Act amendment bill, which passed by the state assembly in July.The Gujarat Prohibition of Transfer of Immoveable Property and Provision for Protection of Tenants from Eviction from Premises in Disturbed Areas (Amendment) Bill 2019, has been pending clearance from the MHA.The ministry sought clarifications on the definition of the phrase “immovable property” among some other provisions in the amendment. More significantly, the MHA sought to know whether provisions of the amended act are in violation of any other law of the Indian Constitution. The Disturbed Areas Act is applicable in communally sensitive areas of Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Himmatnagar, Godhra, Kapadvanj and Bharuch. The state government had amended the act citing loopholes being exploited by vested interests.Before the amendment was passed, a number of new areas were included in the DA Act. In Ahmedabad alone, 74 new localities were notified under this Act in 2018. These new localities are in Paldi, Sarkhej, Vejalpur and Aslali.The MHA queries triggered anxiety among local investors and realtors who, in hope of smooth passage, had parked funds in redevelopment projects and plots located near these new localities now under DA Act.The majority of big ticket investments have been around Sarkej, Vejalpur and Paldi. In Sarkhej, a number of businessmen have bought plots to build homes and commercial projects. In some cases, Hindu-Muslim partnerships have been struck to develop high-end apartments in plots near posh Prahladnagar, which fall on either side of the new DA boundary. “These projects will take off only after the Union government ratifies the amendments suggested in the DA Act and the revenue department finalises the list,” said a builder from the Paldi area. A developer in Paldi pointed out how negotiations for redevelopment of flats around Ashiana, Modern Flats, Zara Apartments and certain housing societies in Kagadiwad, which have a mix of Jain and Hindu residents, were stalled due to the pending MHA approval.Amid opposition from the Congress to the amendment, the state legislature passed the bill, ostensibly to prevent the growth of ghettos in cities like Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Bharuch and smaller towns.A key source in the government said the Gujarat government has replied to the MHA queries, but the home ministry has neither sought further clarifications nor sent the bill to the President for assent.Under the new provisions, the government proposed imprisonment of three to five years and a minimum fine of Rs 1 lakh or 10% of the property value, if a property under the purview of the act is sold by a member of one community to a member of another. Provisions of the act will now also be applicable 500 metres from the limits of disturbed areas.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73164581,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-239312,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/disturbed-areas-act-amendment-held-back-by-mha/articleshow/73163379.cms

PUNE: Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Wednesday said the country was not utilising the intelligence, labour and skill available in abundance to generate employment.

“Nowadays, you hear that there is no employment. Who is saying that there is no employment? We are importing so many things,” Koshyari said. He is the chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and was addressing the 116th convocation ceremony of the university.

There was heavy security on the campus. Unauthorised vehicles were not allowed near the convocation venue and there was strict checking at the entrances for black objects. There was talk that students would wear black badges to protest against CAA and NRC.

Koshyari urged students to work toward an aim instead of getting stuck in a routine job that they don’t like. “We should have self-confidence. Be an optimist. Everybody goes through failures. We have to remember that defeat and failure are not crimes,” Koshyari added.

University officials said due to paucity of time, the university gave away gold medals in a separate ceremony in the morning. Only one gold medal in honour of former President Shankar Dayal Sharma was given to Kajal Mahajan Pandit by the governor in the afternoon ceremony. “I invite all gold medallists to Raj Bhavan for tea the next time I am in Pune,” Koshyari added.

Gagandeep Kang, executive director, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute and the first Indian woman to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society was the chief guest at the function. Kang had three messages for the students, ‘be brave, be accountable and have a contingency plan.’

“While speaking about courage and risk-taking, people talk of Steve Jobs or J K Rowling. We need to look no further than Krantijyoti Savitribai, who was reputed to have carried an extra sari so that she could change when people threw dung at her. A pioneer in every sense, she stood up to her husband’s family and to a community that insulted her, but she persisted, and with results that transformed society. That is true courage,” Kang said.

Known for her interdisciplinary research, development and prevention of enteric infections and their sequelae in children in India, Kang has built national rotavirus and typhoid surveillance networks, established laboratories to support vaccine trials and conducted phase 1-3 clinical trials of vaccines.

Kozhikode: Wayanad district collector Adeela Abdulla has strongly objected to use of photographs of her accepting pro-CAA pamphlet from BJP activists for political purposes.

BJP activists had visited the district collector at her camp office on January 7 as part of the party’s on-going mass door-to- door campaign to garner support for the CAA . They took photographs of the collector accepting the pamphlets. It was widely shared on social media groups stating that she was in support of the Act.

Adeela issued a statement on Wednesday asking people who took the photograph to desist from using it for political purposes or to mislead people. “Yesterday a group of BJP activists came to the camp house to give a pamphlet and said they wanted to take the photograph of it as well. As a district collector it is my duty to receive any representations given to me by people. Though I accepted the pamphlet, I didn’t tell them that I agreed to the contents of the pamphlet in the slightest,” the collector said. Adeela added that it would have been better if the reply she gave to the activists who came to visit her was also published along with the photograph.

She said activists of some Muslim organisations were also undertaking smear campaign against her on the basis of the photograph. The collector said she was planning to file complaints against those who engaged in both type of false campaigns.

Adeela is not the first person in the state to protest the use of photogrpahs for BJP’s pro-CAA campaign.

On Tuesday, the media department of Jamia Markaz came out strongly against the Facebook post of BJP leader A N Radhakrishnan that Sunni leader Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar had held discussions with him on the controversial law.

Karat Razack, LDF-backed independent MLA from Koduvally, had also expressed his displeasure over the BJP using his photograph for pro-CAA campaign. Local BJP leaders had met the MLA at his house to hand over the propaganda material to him.

Donkeys transport Pongal hampers to Nekkanamalai village in Vellore district

VELLORE: For villagers of Nekkanamalai, this Pongal will be special. This time around they don’t have to climb four kilometres down a steep hilly path to collect their Pongal gift hampers. The district authorities have arranged 12 donkeys to deliver the gifts at their village.

Tirupattur collector M P Sivan Arul said he came know about the plight of the villagers in absence of road recently, and so ordered the gifts to be delivered to them on 12 donkeys at the village Public Distribution System (PDS) shop on Thursday.

Residents of Nekkanamalai village, for several generations, have been facing several hardships in absence of a proper road. Villagers said youths find it hard to get married as no one wants to shift to a village with no road connection.

The village, which is about 9km from Vaniyambadi , is home to around 650 people. It is situated at an altitude of 1,500m above sea level.

Valliammal, 70, a villager, said, “Though we are happy and excited to receive the Pongal gift hampers without much hassle this time around, what we really need is a proper road.”

E M Munisamy, 42, a social worker and a native of Nekkanamalai, said, “ The hardships faced by the villagers cannot be explained in words. Not even an ambulance or hearse van can make it to the village. For generations, we carry sick people or the dead in cloth cradles to the nearest city.”

Recently in December 2019, after the death of a villager, Munusamy, his body was carried to the village in a cloth cradle for his funeral, that too during the night time.

After TOI carried a report, collector Sivan Arul had visited the village and assured construction of a road at the earliest. “Our perennial demand is contruction of a proper road between Nekkanamalai and Vaniyambadi. It will solve most of our problems,” Munisamy said.

Speaking to TOI, Sivan Arul said, “We have deployed donkeys to carry the Pongal gift hampers to reduce hassles of the Nekkanamalai villagers. On Thursday the gifts will be distributed to the beneficiaries from the Nekkanamalai PDS shop.”

He said a proposal seeking fund to construct a road covering 300m distance in revenue area, 5,525m in forest area and 1,323m in plain land between Komanampatti Junction and Nekkanamalai had been sent to the department of rural development.

The hostels had been getting only limited quantity of water due to some faulty connections

MADURAI: Madurai Municipal Corporation has set right faulty water connections to a girls’ hostel in Chinna Chokkikulam run by the Adi Dravida Welfare Department within 24 hours after it was brought to the knowledge of the officials.

As many as 680 girls studying in various schools and colleges in Madurai are staying in the hostel. There are seven separate hostels for school, college and polytechnic students functioning on the same campus. While the number of students staying on the campus is high, the hostels have been getting only limited quantity of water due to some faulty connections.

S Malaisamy, a high court lawyer and B Pandiaraja, member, Dalit Vigilance and Monitoring Committee met Madurai Corporation commissioner S Visakan on Monday evening and handed over a petition explaining the plight being faced by the students in the hostel. “The commissioner immediately ordered to set right the problem over phone in front of us. Work started on Tuesday and the issue was set right,” Pandiaraja said.

Pandiaraja said that the issue was with two connections, which were given through the backside of the hostel buildings. Due to sewage leak, the pipe carried sewage mixed water, which could not be used by students. They faced water shortage as water was supplied through only one line through the front side of the building. Now all the three connections have been routed through the front side of the buildings.

Visakan said that he also given instruction to provide new connections as per the requirement of the hostel. The work on new connection has already been taken up by the officials concerned, he said.

GANDHINAGAR: The state government plans to provide alternate housing facilities and even monetary compensation to families who have been living on land owned by various trusts around the Sabarmati Ashram. The central and state governments have chalked out an elaborate plan to redevelop the ashram and convert it into a tourist attraction.

Claiming ownership rights to their houses, residents of the ashram as well as those around it have been protesting against the acquisition of land by the government, contending that Mahatma Gandhi himself had given their forefathers space to stay there.

A top official in the state government said that in a bid to preserve Hriday Kunj (the house where Mahatma Gandhi stayed), the entire ashram complex will require redevelopment. “There are private houses, a girl’s hostel, a state tourism department hotel, petty shops and other establishments within the ashram complex. People park their vehicles in close proximity of Hriday Kunj. The state government has decided to offer alternate homes as well as monetary compensation for those who will be displaced because of redevelopment of the complex,” the officer said. He added that all private buildings, including Toran hotel, will be removed as part of the redevelopment plan. Elaborating on future plans for the ashram, the official said the government intends to develop the whole complex in such a way that visitors can spend three to four hours and get a comprehensive understanding of Gandhiji, India’s freedom struggle and various key milestones in the life of the Mahatma.

“All the trusts working in premises of the Sabarmati Ashram and a proposed new entity will take over management of the proposed new Gandhi Ashram complex,’’ the official added. Allaying fears raised from several quarters, mainly over ownership of land, the official said, “The interests of every stakeholder will be considered before redevelopment work is taken up. The plan will be presented before Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon, after which action will be undertaken.”

File photo used for representational purpose

PUNE: BJP officer bearers, including mayor Muralidhar Mohol, standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne and leader of the house Dheeraj Ghate, recently met former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai.

They said it was a courtesy visit but party insiders said the changed political equations in the state had prompted them to meet Fadnavis to discuss a strategy for the next two years to ensure that the party continues its dominance in the PMC.

With over 95 corporators, BJP is in complete command in the PMC. The party is set to face a united opposition from Shiv Sena , NCP and Congress ahead of the 2022 civic polls. It is also likely to be challenged while getting support from the Sena-led state government for executing civic projects.

A senior leader from the BJP said, “There was good coordination between the civic body and the state government till Diwali. However, the equations changed at the state level in the last two months. We are no more in the driving seat there,” he said.

The leader said the next two years were crucial for the party as it will have to come out with a good performance in the city. Party leaders, especially corporators, will have to maintain the momentum and keep themselves engaged with citizens.

Mohol, who was the standing committee chairman, said the meeting with Fadnavis was a courtesy call and had no political agenda. “Since the party has introduced new officer-bearers in the PMC, we decided to meet Fadnavis and the other leaders of our party to seek their guidance on various issues. Every corporator of our party in the PMC is working hard for the city’s development,” Mohol said.

Sources from political circles said the outcome of the state elections is likely to impact political developments in the city. An NCP leader said, “ The assembly results and Ajit Pawar as the guardian minister have recharged our party workers. People are fed up with the BJP and are looking for a change,” the leader said.

AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Wednesday denied anticipatory bail to Harmesh Bhatt, one of the organizers of an NGO, Asha Foundation, in connection with charges of selling livestock that a court had remanded in the custody of the NGO.

In December, some 1,360 goats and sheep were impounded by Ramol police and handed over to Asha Foundation for keeping until the case for animal cruelty was decided by court. A few days later, some of the animals were spotted at the Ranip Bakra Mandi on sale. The owners complained at different police stations that their livestockhad gone missing, said the complainant’s advocate, Shamshad Pathan.

The police in Ramol, Odhav and Naroda arrested a few persons. At the same time, the organizers of the NGO, Amit Bhavsar, Vinu Salat and Bhatt applied for pre-arrest bail.

The court has already refused protection to Bhavsar and Salat. Additional sessions judge V J Kalotara refused bail to Bhatt on Wednesday, after Ramol police told the court that the foundation’s claims about handing over custody of the animals to various cattle pounds were not all true. The animals were handed over to the Idar panjrapol, which claimed that the animals were then given to a panjarapol in Deesa. On inquiry, the Deesa panjarapol denied having received the animals.

226,['9/01/2020'],Strike total and peaceful in Kerala,"This story is from January 9, 2020

A couple during a ‘save the date’ photoshoot at SM Street in Kozhikode on Wednesday

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The nation-wide strike called by the various trade unions virtually turned into a hartal in the state. With KSRTC buses, private buses, taxis and auto rickshaws keeping off the roads, shops and establishments remaining closed and government offices, banks and educational institutions shut, life was paralysed across the state.

The strike was peaceful with no major law and order issue being reported in the state. Though pro-BJP trade union BMS stayed away from the strike, the impact was not visible as a majority of workers in the state are affiliated to unions under CITU, AITUC and INTUC.

All ministers, including the chief minister, stayed away from the office at the Secretariat. Finance minister Thomas Isaac didn’t attend Soorya festival, a cultural event he had committed to, on Wednesday. Devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran shunned his official car and rode a scooter to the protest meeting of the trade unions in the state capital. The joint protest rally organized by employees to the Secretariat was inaugurated by CITU general secretary Elamaram Kareem.

The KSRTC did not operate regular services in the state. However, the bus service to Pampa was not affected and Sabarimala witnessed a huge crowd on the strike day. Though train services were not affected, those who alighted at the railway stations were stranded for want of vehicles to reach their destinations.

In the state capital, the police operated services to the medical college, regional cancer centre, airport and to other important destinations.

In Ernakulam, Kunnathunadu police registered two cases of attacks during the strike. Two shop owners, in separate incidents, were injured after strike supporters forced them to down shutters.

Elamaram Kareem, S Vijayakuamra Nair of the joint council and INTUC state president R Chandrashekar thanked the people for supporting the strike. K K Divakaran, general secretary of All India Road Transport Worker’s Federation said the strike was total in the state and about 3.5 crore workers and owners in the transport industry across the country participated.

Meanwhile, BJP came out against the strike terming it a government-sponsored one. “Labour strike by a section of trade unions swelled into a hartal in Kerala with the active support of the CPM-led state government,” said BJP spokesperson M S Kumar.

“Police stood mute witness to atrocities in connection with the strike. It’s a paradox that the state government supplied fodder to a shutdown strike ahead of the state hosting a global investor’s meet. Politically motivated actions of the state government would only help drive away investors. The attack on Muthoot M D George Alexander is a telling example of the plight of investors in Kerala,” he added.

ROORKEE: Police on Wednesday said it had solved the murder of Qamar Alam, the 50-year old village head of Nagla Kubda village near Roorkee , who was shot dead on December 20. According to police, Alam had an old enmity with a man Abeed Ahmed, who hired Muzaffarnagar-based shooters to murder him. Police have arrested the three shooters who allegedly carried out the murder.

According to inspector Rajesh Sah of Gangnahar police station, the enmity between Alam and Ahmed dated back to 2010, when the latter killed Alam’s older brother. Alam then retaliated by having Ahmed’s younger brother Farukh killed in 2012. “Due to this ongoing enmity, Ahmed hired contract killers for Rs 10 lakh to eliminate Alam,” said Sah. Police said that Ahmed paid Wasim, a history-sheeter from Muzaffarnagar Rs 10 lakh to kill Alam. Wasim then assigned the task to his brothers Naim and Salmaan and their friend Dilshad. On December 20, when Alam was returning from Roorkee court, two bike-borne men emerged at the gate and shot him from a close range

228,['9/01/2020'],BJP MP held hostage at Visva-Bharati,"This story is from January 9, 2020

SANTINIKETAN: BJP Rajya Sabha member and writer Swapan Dasgupta was forcibly confined to an auditorium at Visva-Bharati in Santiniketan for almost five hours on Wednesday as students protesting against the new citizenship law stood outside, shouting slogans and refusing to let him leave.

Dasgupta had vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty for company inside the auditorium, whose collapsible gate was locked from outside by the protesters.

After his ordeal ended, Dasgupta tweeted: ""Drama ends in Visva-Bharati without the confrontation that some protesters desperately wanted.""

The siege was reminiscent of the hostility Union minister Babul Supriyo had faced from students at Jadavpur University when he visited the campus for an event on September 19. But unlike Supriyo, who was allegedly manhandled, Dasgupta apparently didn't face any violence.

""How does it feel to have a mob attack a peaceful meeting on CAA ...? This is what is happening to a meeting I am addressing at Visva Bharati now. Locked into room now with a howling mob outside, itching for confrontation,"" Dasgupta had tweeted from captivity after some students allegedly scaled a wall and shouted slogans through the windows.

The gherao at Visva-Bharati started around 4.30pm and was lifted at 9.25pm, minutes after governor Jagdeep Dhankhar contacted DGP Virendra. ""Such anarchy and failure of law and order are worrisome,"" Dhankhar tweeted.

During the protest against Supriyo at JU, the governor had rushed to the south Kolkata campus to escort him out of the campus. ""I had come on an invitation from the university to speak at a lecture series on CAA. This was not a political forum. If someone does this, it only reflects an attitude that goes against the principles of democratic thinking. I had expected the students to participate in the seminar and oppose CAA. It could have been a healthy discussion. Initially, the seminar was planned at Lipika auditorium. But later, the venue was shifted because I was told there were chances of confrontation. But we didn't want any confrontation,"" Dasgupta said.

Somnath Sow, an SFI leader, accused vice-chancellor Chakrabarty of precipitating the stand-off. ""The VC organised the seminar on a day the entire country was protesting against CAA-NPR-NRC. He invited Swapan Dasgupta as the sole speaker at the seminar,"" he said.

The protesters had assembled at the university's central office hours before the scheduled start of the seminar at 10.30am, locking the gates and hanging posters bearing slogans against PM Narendra Modi and CAA. At 2pm, they moved to the main entrance of the auditorium and blocked the gate before Dasgupta arrived to speak at 3pm. Sensing the mood, the university authorities shifted the venue to an auditorium on the Sriniketan campus, about a kilometre away.

The protesters came to know about the venue change 45 minutes later and reached there at 4.30pm. Around 6pm, Visva-Bharati officials tried to persuade the students to disperse, but they wouldn't listen.

Suchitra Bhattacharya, a professor in the department of economics and politics, said the situation could have been avoided. ""We had urged the VC to shift the seminar to a different date and invite a panel of speakers instead of just one. The VC didn't pay heed to our request. He only invited Dasgupta.""

With the stir continuing into the night, Trinamool functionaries started sending feelers to the Visva-Bharati protesters that being a central university, the CISF was in charge of its security. ""While the VC didn't call CISF to clear the protesters, there was a chance of disturbance and confrontation from the outside,"" a Trinamool leader said.

BJP national secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said in a video message: ""Our Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta is being held up at Visva-Bharati for hours. Police haven't taken steps as yet. If anything happens to the MP, things will get out of control.""

Pilibhit: More than 175 matured shisham and Jamun trees were allegedly cut and smuggled from Haripur forest range of the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve, according to superintendent of police Abhishek Dixit, who busted a nexus between forest department personnel and smugglers.

The SP said, “It was a well-planned conspiracy by the smugglers who managed to obtain the forest and wildlife division’s permit for cutting trees standing in the agricultural fields close to the forest area. However, gradually they started cutting trees in the forest area in collusion with the range officer and field staff.”

According to the SP, the exchequer suffered a loss of over Rs 5 crore; besides, it also harmed the forest’s ecology.

“The forest and wildlife division had issued eight permits on December 18, of which only one was found to be genuine. Of the remaining seven, four permits issued for the agricultural field which was eroded by the Sharda and the standing trees washed away,” said Dixit.

PTR deputy director Naveen Khandelwal said shisham trees were cut in a vast area of over 200 hectares in the PTR’s Haripur forest range, where migrants from eastern UP were rehabilitated nearly 30 years ago. “The area is saturated with shisham trees mostly over 100 years old. The valuable trees could not be freed from trespassers and we brought the matter to the knowledge of the high court as well.”

As the police department needed the land record during the inquiry, the matter was referred to district magistrate Vaibhav Shrivastav, who set up an inquiry by Pilibhit Sadar SDM Vandana Trivedi.

“We are waiting for the report for lodging an FIR in the matter. However, we have seized the remaining stock of timber,” added the SP.

Asked about the SDM’s findings, the DM said, “She has been promoted to the city magistrate and transferred to Banda district. Now, I will hand over the inquiry to another officer. This completion of inquiry may take some time.”

Commuting on the route is a nightmare.The first stretch is from Euro School to Pumpkin Patch School and the other is near Vinode Vasti, particularly from near Hotel Mastiff to Hotel Aditya OYO.Both 200-300 metre stretches are rather treacherous due to the condition of the road. The absence of a divider adds to the commuters’ woes.Shirish Poredi, spokesperson of the civic body’s engineering department, said, “There were land acquisition problems due to which we could not widen and tar the road properly. We have been able to acquire one stretch of 150 metre and will tar this land to create a road. We have also repaired the potholes near Pumpkin Patch School in Wakad.”“Pothole repair work in other areas will be completed in a fortnight. There is still land acquisition problem in some parts due to which we cannot widen the road and tar it,” he said.Sagar Baheti, who lives near Bhumkar Chowk, said, “Minor accidents involving two-wheelers occur regularly as they skid due to the potholes and gravel. Further the vehicles move slowly due to the potholes causing traffic snarls. We had expected that the PCMC begin pothole repairing work immediately after the end of monsoon . People have had to suffer hardships due to the delay.”Another local resident Mihir Mistry said, “The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) must complete the land acquisition quickly for widening the road to reduce the traffic congestion on this busy road linking the city to Hinjewadi IT park.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73166432,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-462065,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/road-resurfacing-to-benefit-techies-at-hinjewadi-it-park/articleshow/73163388.cms

If buildings do not have STPs, then Corporation should initiate penal measures and legal action against them. Instead, they are blaming the GCDA and are avoiding responsibilities.”For obtaining building permits from the Corporation, builders have to produce a service plan for power/water connection and sewage while submitting applications, as per Kerala Municipal Building Rules (KMBR). The builders or apartment owners’ association is responsible for timely renewal of the approvals granted by the Kerala state pollution control board. “The local body has to check whether the building has obtained renewed certificates,” he said.On a question regarding the functioning of the STP at Marine Drive, Salim said GCDA convened a meeting of occupants of both commercial and residential structures on the old walkway. The plant has been set up to serve buildings on the old walkway. He said that it has come to GCDA’s attention that many buildings on the old stretch have not been connected to the STP. Some of them have not paid their share of money for using the facility. “In such cases the waste water is mostly pumped directly to the backwaters through underground pipes. Building owners are avoiding expenses related to the operation of a sewage treatment plant. GCDA has started to collect data relating to those using the plant and its operations,” added Salim.According to GCDA, most of the apartment complexes are located on the new stretch of the walkway from Old Boat Jetty at HC junction to Goshree bridge. “These are all new structures and these buildings should have an effectively functioning STPs,” said Salim.GCDA also said the corporation should publish a list of high-rises which do not have STPs, and those buildings which have not renewed the permits of pollution control board.

233,['9/01/2020'],Dehradun: Why are roads repaired shoddily year on year?,"This story is from January 9, 2020

The state of Raipur road

DEHRADUN: The roads in the state capital are claimed to be repaired by the Public Works Department (PWD) throughout the year. However, it doesn’t seem to show, as most roads either have potholes or their top surface is eroding, highlighting the shoddy quality of repair work that has been done. As per data provided by PWD officials, the department repaired 93 kilometers of main roads — connecting Dehradun to other parts of Uttarakhand , Himachal Pradesh, New Delhi and Uttar Pradesh — while carrying out patchworks on an almost 104 kilometer-stretch within Dehradun district in 2019. In 2018, the department claims to have repaired 198 kilometers of highway roads against their target of 263 kilometers as well as carrying out patchwork and new road construction in around 21.6 kilometers.

Residents say that money spent by the department seems to be getting wasted year on year. “PWD spends lakhs in constructing roads and filling up the dug-up patches. Still, the roads here in Dehradun, even though it is the state capital, wear a shoddy look,” said Vineet Semwal, a resident of Race Course.

Many feel that the biggest reason for the shoddy work is poor material quality and lack of monitoring. “The contractors often use poor quality material. There is no mechanism to monitor the work of the contractor and they take advantage of this loophole. PWD should blacklist the contractors who do shoddy work which is the only way to inculcate fear among those responsible for road construction,” said Naveen Kumar Sadana of Waste Warriors, an NGO involved in waste management and other civic issues.

So, what are the possible solutions? According to Sadana, MLP (multi-layer plastic) roads should become the norm in the city as these roads have longer durability and less maintenance cost.

“Back in 2016-17, the road near Dehradun Club was turned into an MLP road and PWD data reveals that it incurred the least amount of maintenance cost. However, I believe the contractors are not interested in MLP roads as it is highly unlikely they will get another contract for the same road soon,” he said.

According to Ashish Garg, a civil engineer and resident of Kewal Vihar, the solution lies in constructing roads after completely scratching the dug-up and dilapidated road.

“PWD keeps on constructing new roads over the already existing ones. This is the reason why, in many areas like Canal Road, the roads are getting elevated while level of houses has gone down. Re-layering also affects the quality of roads which is happening rapidly in Dehradun,” said Garg.

PWD officials meanwhile chose to put the blame on other departments.

BN Chaudhary, senior engineer, PWD, alleged, “We construct roads and then officials of other departments dig it up again. There are many examples. After the monsoons, we had constructed the road near Astley Hall but the Jan Sansthan dug it up again to lay sewage pipeline. We have just constructed roads in Rajpur area and now received a letter from GAIL that they will be digging the road again to lay CNG pipeline. How many times are we are expected to construct a road in a year? There should be better co-ordination between departments.”

Whatever be the excuses that are being put forth, there can be no excuse for shoddy roads in the state capital. All talk of making Doon a smart city will be hollow unless the government sincerely focuses on making the city’s roads smooth — and ensure that they remain so.

CHENNAI: From small stations where people will walk straight to the platforms to buy tickets to massive underground stations with four-level shopping arenas and spartan interiors — metro stations in North Chennai will have a new look and feel when the Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar line will be commissioned in six months.Changes in design were made to the stations to cut cost and speed up construction without compromising on commuter comfort.“We have made changes to make stations smaller and smarter, but the passenger area will be the same in terms of size,” a metro rail official said. “Track and electrical traction work will be completed by February. We will need four months for trials. We will be ready for a June or July opening and we expect 30% to 40% more passengers,” said a metro rail official.The line will have six elevated and three underground stations. Changes were made to the stations because of protests by locals for various reasons. For instance, commuters will directly walk into the platforms of the elevated Gowri Ashram metro station built at a height of 17m as CMRL did away with concourse or ticketing level and raised the elevation of the corridor to ensure the line does not hinder the movement of a temple car during festivals. The average height of the elevated corridor is 13m while the height was increased only in Gowri Ashram station, making it the tallest station on the stretch.Access to this station will be through a foot over-bridge with stairs and escalators sandwiched between a row of shops on the narrow and congested Thiruvottiyur High Road.At the Theagaraya College underground station it’s a quid pro quo. Metro rail officials said they would give the college access to the columns of the station to raise another structure. The station is being built under the college playground about 100m away from the main road with an 80m underground passage for commuter entry. The college students protested against CMRL for taking over their college land for construction of the station. “If the college plans to build a four-storey building above our station box, they could raise pillars from our columns and our station already has a foundation to hold the structure,” said an engineer at the site.While construction on top of underground station boxes are otherwise not allowed, those in north Chennai have been built with a four-level shopping area which could be accessed both by commuters and shoppers.The interiors of the stations will have a raw design with no false ceiling but black painted roofs holding the cables and air-conditioning ducts in place. “We were able to make stations 25% smaller than those in phase-1 by incorporating changes in the equipment like procuring smaller vertical exhaust fans that would now be installed in the shaft jutting out to the road level inside of placing them in a separate room like it is in phase-1 station,” an official said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73166041,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-851586,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/public-demand-cost-cutting-make-metro-rail-tweak-design-of-stations-in-n-chennai/articleshow/73163389.cms

File photo of the dormitory at the Pune railway station

PUNE: Bedbugs are forcing passengers to spend sleepless nights at the dormitory of the Pune railway station.

Responding to complaints, the authorities have promised extermination of the pests in the next two months.

“There have been some complaints related to cleanliness. A tender has been floated to hand over the facility to an independent agency. Within a month, it will be finalised and things will change. The selected contractor will draw up a plan on development of the dormitory. We are hoping that things will be in order by March,” said a source at the Indian Railways Stations Development Corporation (IRSDC) which looks after the facility management of the Pune station.

Ajay Sahani, who lives in Nagpur and travels to Pune frequently, said he spends sleepless nights at the dormitory.

“The main issue is with bedbugs. With the facility to be given to a private party, we hope that things will improve,” he said.

In May last year, the officials of the BVG Group, appointed by the IRSDC for facility management at the station, told TOI that the commercialisation of the dormitory was on the anvil and there could be a possibility of hike in booking charges.

“The idea is to upgrade the dormitory. A plan to properly brand the dormitory of the Pune station is being prepared,” an official said.

Another passenger said, “If the charges are increased nominally, we are okay with it but the services need to improve. How can one sleep on beds full of bugs? Besides, there is the problem of low water pressure in one of the washrooms.”

The Pune station has a 26-bed dormitory at present.

In addition, there are six beds with air-conditioned facility.

One can log on to eRail.in and book beds at the facility. The rates are Rs200 for 12 hours and Rs400 for 24 hours.

“The contract will be given to someone specialising in the field and the proposal as to how the facilities could be improved at the dormitory would be studied carefully,” the official asserted.

Harsha Shah, president, Railway Pravasi Group, said that such services needed to be perfect right from the start.

“It was said things would be improved from May last year, but nothing has been done in the past 9 months. By now, the facility should have been perfect considering that the station is now in private hands,” he said.

Indian Oil has six fuel terminals in the state, one each in Tondiarpet, Korukkupet, Trichy, Madurai, Sankaridu... Read More

CHENNAI: With April 1 being the deadline to switch over to cleaner BSVI-compliant auto fuels, select pumps in Chennai have begun to dispense the upgraded petrol and diesel with a target of complete conversion in Tamil Nadu by February.

The country will migrate to BSVI fuel standards from April 1 from the present BSIV. BSVI fuel will bring down sulphur content by five times from the current BSIV levels. It has 10 PPM of sulphur as against 50PPM now.

By reducing toxic substances in the air, it will help reduce air pollution, besides reducing NOx, high levels of which can cause respiratory problems. The lower sulphur will help reduce harmful exhaust emissions like NO2, CO and SO2.

Indian Oil has six fuel terminals in the state, one each in Tondiarpet, Korukkupet, Trichy, Madurai , Sankaridurg and Coimbatore. The Korukkupet terminal, which feeds pumps in Central and South Chennai, has already begun to dispense BSVI fuel.

“We started the conversion to BSVI last November. We have almost completed all the BSVI related work at our end and by February everything will be BSVI,” said P Jayadevan, executive director, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry , Indian Oil. All the fuel terminals of Indian Oil are almost ready except Coimbatore which will be fed with BPCL fuel from Kochi Refinery.

“We don’t think there will be an appreciable increase in pump prices due to this as international prices dictate fuel pricing,” he said. “The best part of BSVI is that it will completely eliminate adulteration possibilities. As we stand now, fuel adulteration is a thing of the past.”

Existing BSIV vehicle users do not need to tweak or modify or worry about the new fuel. “There is no need to change anything in your old vehicle. These can run on the upgraded fuels,” he said adding that vehicle owners will not be able to feel any difference while driving or riding.

Representative image

PUNE: Here is a news for home-based entrepreneurs to cheer about. They can run their business without the corporation’s permission. Better still, they will not have to pay a penny as fees.

The Pune Municipal Corporation ( PMC ) has decided not to make licences mandatory for home-based businesses, including beauty parlours. According to the corporation officials, the decision was taken in the standing committee meeting during the discussion on licence fees on Tuesday.

A proposal to increase the fees for beauty parlours, hospitals, hotels, eateries and clinics was tabled before the standing committee. The proposal had suggested a hike in charges for licence to keep dogs and other pets, too.

“The elected members of the PMC decided not to go for a hike and keep the fees as they were. The proposal to increase the fees was rejected,” said a senior official of the PMC.

The elected members claimed that the decision to keep the domestic enterprises out of the purview of the licence regime was taken to prevent any hassles for the operators.

“Most of those who operate these businesses belong to the middle or lower middle class. They cannot afford to start big set-ups and their aim is to give a helping hand to the family. Many women run these enterprises. So, the decision of not charging any fees has been taken,” said Hemant Rasane, the chairman of the standing committee.

He said the health department and other civic departments used to give permits to the businesses that operated out of homes. But now they would be exempted from seeking such permits.

Many small entrepreneurs hailed the decision of the corporation. “This will help me concentrate more on my business, without worrying about permits,” said a woman, who runs a stitching business from home.

A senior official of the PMC said the home-based entrepreneurs would have to follow the set norms of the PMC though they would not have to seek permit from it.

“These ventures should not be operated by flouting the norms of the civic body. They should not function out of illegal premises. The establishments should be encroachment-free. Besides, they should not violate any rules of building permissions or property tax ,” said, adding that the PMC would maintain a record of such enterprises.

Thiruvananthapuram: National Commission for Minorities (NCM) has sought reports from principal secretaries of state finance and PWD secretaries on a complaint of harassment filed by social activist Jomon Puthenpurackal. In a petition filed to NCM vice-chairman George Kurian, Jomon alleged that both PWD and finance departments were haunting him by forging fake reports, asking him to pay hefty amount as fine for overstay in PWD guest houses.

The petitioner alleged that he was being targeted as he belonged to Knanaya Catholic community and has been fighting for justice in the Sister Abhaya murder case. He alleged that the officials conspired and harassed him over the issue of paying rent. According to Puthenpurackal, he was asked to pay Rs 42,670 as rent arrears to the government by the PWD buildings assistant engineer on July 12, 2019. He alleged that the notice was the result of vendetta by the officials as he had filed some complaints against senior officials of PWD and finance departments.

By submitting supporting documents, Puthenpurackal said a department level enquiry conducted by the PWD concluded that he didn’t need to pay any arrears as that had been a fault of officials who hadn’t charged the rent as per norms at the time of stay. He said the PWD issued a notice by ignoring this report with a clear intention of harassment. The NCM asked both officials to file their reports within three weeks. tnn

Bareilly: Power department employees on Wednesday held a protest against the UP governments’ bid to privatise the electricity distribution and demanded revival of the old pension scheme.

In Bareilly division, around 300 power department employees under the banner of Vidyut Karamchari Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti, UP, staged protests at respective regional offices. Nearly, 15 lakh power department employees working with various distribution companies under UPPCL participated in the one-day nationwide strike.

Gaurav Sharma, co-coordinator of Vidyut Karamchari Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti, told TOI, “Nearly, 300 employees under Bareilly division — including Bareilly, Pilibhit, Budaun and Shahjahanpur — joined the protest at their respective offices. Our demands included the rollback of the UP government’s decision to privatise power distribution, withdrawal of the regressive changes being made in the Labour Law, and cancelling the contract of power distribution franchise in Agra and privatisation in Greater Noida, among others. Besides, the old pension scheme should be revived and should apply to the employees joining services post-2000.”

Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (MVVNL) superintendent engineer (rural) Tariq Jalil said, “The privatisation experiment has failed in Agra and it should be taken as a lesson. The government says the move is aimed at improvising power distribution and minimising the loss, but we are already giving 24-hour supply in urban areas and working on replicating it in the rural areas as well. Privatisation, therefore, is unnecessary.”

Due to protest, the departmental works remained suspended from 10am to 5pm, causing inconvenience to consumers; electricity bills could not be paid as the counters remained shutting, while complaints such as power-cuts and break-downs were not entertained throughout the day.

Malappuram: A tussle is brewing between Malappuram district collector Jafar Malik and Nilambur MLA P V Anvar over the rehabilitation of flood-affected tribal families in Kavalappara and Pothukallu regions of Nilambur.

The issue started when Anvar on Tuesday alleged lapses on the part of the collector in rehabilitating flood-affected tribal families of Kavalappara. The MLA along with a group of tribal families in Kavalappara blocked the construction works of houses being built for the flood-affected families at Chembankolli in Edakkara panchayat on Tuesday afternoon.

Construction of 34 houses on five acres in Edakkara panchayat using CSR fund of Federal Bank had begun last week. The revenue authorities were planning to rehabilitate flood-affected tribal families in Chalikkal Colony in Pothukallu panchayat, in these houses. The land was identified by the district administration and tribal development department. However, Anvar alleged that the revenue authorities did not discuss the plan of the project with people’s representatives. “Revenue authorties should give priority to rehabilitate tribal families in Kavalappara who are currently staying in an auditorium, instead of rehabilitating families in Chalikkal colony”, he said.

But the collector immediately responded to the MLA’s allegations through a social media post on Tuesday night. He said he will take legal action against the MLA for blocking construction. He said revenue authorities had offered the new houses in Edakkara to Kavalappara families. But they rejected the offer as they were not ready to move to another panchayat. Responding to the allegation of Anvar, the collector said there is no need to inform him procedures of land purchase as he is not part of purchasing committee.

But, on Wednesday the MLA said in a press meet that he would file a defamation case against the collector for making wrong statements against the Rebuild Nilambur programme, which was designed to collect money and land to help the flood victims. Collector, earlier made a comment that Rebuild Nilambur received 12 acres of land from a sponsor. However, P V Anvar challenged collector to prove his claim in the court.

Alappuzha: Nobel prize winner Michael Levitt was stranded in a houseboat after general strike supporters blocked the boat in which he was enjoying the beauty of Kuttanad in Alappuzha on Wednesday.

The organizers had exempted the tourism industry from the strike, but they blocked Levitt, a guest of the state government. “Levitt was miffed and told us he is a VIP guest, and its not fair blocking the houseboat even after the tourism industry was exempted from the strike. He had a bad impression of Kerala since this experience,” one of the boat crew told TOI.

Levitt began his cruise in a houseboat named ‘Lake View’ from Kumarakom in Kottayam on Tuesday evening and was anchored near R Block in Kuttanad for night halt.

“On Tuesday evening, the strike supporters asked us not to operate the boat. However, on Wednesday morning, we started our trip around 10am. Around 10.30am they stopped us. They asked us to anchor near C Block in Kuttanad and we did so,” an employee of the boat said. Around 12.30pm, the boat was allowed to continue the journey.

Levitt, an acclaimed biophysicist, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2013 for the development of multi-scale models for complex chemical systems. Levitt called at Kerala University in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday and delivered a lecture at the department of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics on the Karyavattom campus.

Pulinkunnu police registered cases under Section 283 of the Indian Penal Code (Danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation), IPC 342 (Punishment for wrongful confinement) and IPC 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) against four strike supporters in connection with the incident.

Sub-inspector C Gopalakrishnan said that he had met Levitt but the Nobel laureate refused to lodge a complaint. “Levitt told me that he had read in newspapers that the tourism industry was exempted from the strike asked why the houseboat was blocked. But he was not ready to lodge a complaint,” said the sub-inspector. Police registered the case based on the complaint of the boat crew.

Achuthsankar S Nair, head of the Department of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at University of Kerala, in his Facebook post said that Levitt mailed him after the houseboat was blocked by the strike supporters. His FB post read, “Prof Michael Levitt, Nobel laureate was a fan of Kerala till yesterday. Today, he was stopped from a pre-booked houseboat journey. He mailed me this: I have been warned against protesting to the union people who are illegally enforcing the strike against the union declaration that “tourism is excepted”. This treatment of a guest of the state government is not good for tourism, state, or the country.”

Sreekumar MP, the houseboat owner, said that his guest Levitt was upset after the boat was blocked . “He is disappointed. We had prepared special Kerala-style non-vegetarian dishes. But he could not enjoy his lunch. He will check out on Thursday morning at Kumarakom,” Sreekumar said.

MADURAI: Big data solution is much-needed in India for accurate data collection and analysis, said Niti Aayog vice-chairman Dr Rajiv Kumar at the inaugural session of the 56th annual conference of The Indian Econometric Society (TIES) held in Madurai on Wednesday.

A three-day national conference jointly organized by TIES and School of Economics, Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) was inaugurated at the university’s Nagamalai-Pudukottai campus.

Delivering the presidential address, professor Ravindra H Dholakia, member of RBI’s MPC, said “Inflation impacts economic growth . For our country to become a five trillion economy by 2024, we need at least 8% rate of growth. For such a result, our fiscal deficit target should be at 6.5% and the inflation target should be at 5.4%. We can only focus on one objective at a time.”

On the other hand, Dr C Rangarajan, former RBI governor who gave the Prof Sukhomoy Chakravarty memorial lecture, was of the opinion that threshold inflation could vary with differences in opinion and that inflation must never be out of control. “Inflation rate must not exceed 6% to avoid an adverse impact on economic growth. Price stability must be maintained while accelerating growth. Under threshold inflation, we should be able to adopt policies so as to promote other objectives. The RBI’s objectives and targets must be clear,” he added.

Around 150 delegates, all students / scholars of economics are participating in the conference this year. Various eminent speakers from across India will be addressing them over all three days and several technical sessions have also been planned.

246,['9/01/2020'],ASCEND just an eyewash: Chennithala,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has come out against ASCEND 2020 global investors meet, which is beginning in Kochi on Thursday. While terming the meet as an eyewash, Ramesh said the government has only 11 more months in power and in this short period of time none of the projects that might come up in the meet are going to get implemented.

“The next assembly election is likely to happen in March or April, 2021. In between, the local body election will be held in November this year and Kuttanadu bypoll is also expected in another four months. Once the election notification is in place for all these polls, the government will only get 11 months for governance. How can they then implement any of the new projects which might come up in the investors meet,’’ he asked.

If the LDF government was sincere in the development projects, then it would have organised such an investors meet in the first or second year after assuming power. Now, the government will not even get time to have a preliminary discussion to execute the projects. Hence, the government is now organising this event to claim that they have attracted several investments during their tenure, Chennithala said.

The LDF government under Pinarayi Vijayan was a total failure in the development front and they cannot even claim a single major development project was commenced during their tenure. “When Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan had asked a question to the chief minister in the assembly in September, 2019 about the major infrastructure and development projects launched in the state under the LDF rule, the answer given was ‘details are being collected’. A government, which cannot even collect the details of the projects they have carried out even after four years in power, is fooling the people by organising such an event,” said Chennithala. LDF has flayed the previous UDF government for organising global investors meet in Kochi. “When the UDF government had organised such events, LDF had boycotted and campaigned against them,” he said. Even several of the projects executed by the previous UDF government were taken into a slow pace under the present LDF government, he said.

It has become the habit of LDF to oppose such investors meet and block all the investments raising protests when they are in the opposition and then come back with an investors meet when they are in power to fool the people of the state. The fate of Vizhinjam port, Smart City project in Kochi and national highway development are the perfect examples of their double standards, said the opposition leader.

MADURAI: A 33-year-old woman was murdered by some unidentified persons when she was sleeping in her house. The incident took place in Bharathi Ula Road near Thamaraithotti in the city early on Wednesday morning.

The deceased was identified as K Lavanya, a mother of two girls aged 14 and five years respectively. Her mother-in-law M Seeniammal alias Jayanthi suffered stab injuries on her neck and was admitted in a hospital. Lavanya’s husband M Kumaraguru is running a utensil shop in East Veli Street.

According to police sources, two unidentified persons, who came on a bike entered the house at 3.50am. They first attacked Seeniammal, who was sleeping in the hall. Then they went to the first floor, where Lavanya was sleeping in a bedroom along with her daughters. The duo hacked and stabbed her using sharp weapons.

Police said that while her younger daughter froze on seeing the brutal attack, her elder daughter rushed to the ground floor and alerted her father, who was sleeping in a separate room. By the time Kumaraguru reached the first floor, the murderers escaped. He found his wife lying dead on the bed. He alerted the police and shifted his mother to a private hospital.

The Tallakulam police registered a case. Deputy commissioner of police (law and order) E Karthick visited the house and hospital and conducted an inquiry.

Police said they are yet to find out the motive behind the incident and the perpetrators involved. They had analysed CCTV footage available in nearby places. Footage has corroborated the information given by the daughters that two people entered the house.

TRICHY: A panchayat union primary school (PUPS) at K Paramathi in Karur district has earned praise from the school education department for the commendable performance of its school management committee (SMC) which usually remains a namesake in most schools. The department has asked government schools to take inspiration from the PUPS in constituting SMC and shared the link to a short film on the best practises adopted by the school.

The Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009 mandates formation of school management committee (SMC) in every government school to ensure community participation. However, the committee comprising parents and members of the local body to enable interaction with teachers has been remaining on paper in most state schools. “The general complaint among schools is that parents don’t attend SMC meeting. But we can ensure their participation by involving them in school activities.,” said headmaster PUPS K Paramathi R Selvakkannan. Many schools also avoid empowering SMC as they see it as an infringement on academic activity. Development of the school cannot happen without community participation, he said. Selvakkannan, also recipient of national award for best teacher, explained how parents as SMC members are working as special teachers in the school and contributing to the students’ allround development. They teach spoken English and train students in handicrafts. One of the SMC member, who works as a driver and is an avid painter has been training interested children in painting. President of SMC at the PUPS K Paramathi C Thanikaiselvi expressed happiness over the best practices adopted by the school becoming a government order for implementation in other schools in the state. Selvakkannan told TOI that it was at the monthly meeting of SMC where he received most of the ideas which he could implement in the school with the help of SMC.

Bareilly: Power department employees on Wednesday held a protest against the UP governments’ bid to privatise the electricity distribution and demanded revival of the old pension scheme.

In Bareilly division, around 300 power department employees under the banner of Vidyut Karamchari Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti, UP, staged protests at respective regional offices. Nearly, 15 lakh power department employees working with various distribution companies under UPPCL participated in the one-day nationwide strike.

Gaurav Sharma, co-coordinator of Vidyut Karamchari Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti, told TOI, “Nearly, 300 employees under Bareilly division — including Bareilly, Pilibhit, Budaun and Shahjahanpur — joined the protest at their respective offices. Our demands included the rollback of the UP government’s decision to privatise power distribution, withdrawal of the regressive changes being made in the Labour Law, and cancelling the contract of power distribution franchise in Agra and privatisation in Greater Noida, among others. Besides, the old pension scheme should be revived and should apply to the employees joining services post-2000.”

Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (MVVNL) superintendent engineer (rural) Tariq Jalil said, “The privatisation experiment has failed in Agra and it should be taken as a lesson. The government says the move is aimed at improvising power distribution and minimising the loss, but we are already giving 24-hour supply in urban areas and working on replicating it in the rural areas as well. Privatisation, therefore, is unnecessary.”

Due to protest, the departmental works remained suspended from 10am to 5pm, causing inconvenience to consumers; electricity bills could not be paid as the counters remained shutting, while complaints such as power-cuts and break-downs were not entertained throughout the day.

251,['9/01/2020'],Kozhikode to get 26 electric vehicle charging stations,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Kozhikode: The Kerala State Electricity Board is set to start 26 electric vehicles charging centres in the district.

The plan is to start charging stations with the support of empanelled agencies and private parties.

The KSEB has already floated tenders for six electric vehicle charging stations. The plan is to set up charging stations in the city and other areas in the district.

The number of electric vehicles operational in the district is very low as per the current data, said Bose Jacob, deputy chief engineer KSEB. However, the KSEB is planning to introduce a number of vehicle charging stations as the state government aims to increase the number of electric vehicles to 1 million by 2022, he said.

The plan is to set up charging stations at every 4km to help the electric vehicle users. The KSEB is planning to start the charging stations at KSEB’s own land or other government land in the initial phase. Discussions have started with private parties also for commencing charging stations with private partnership.

Of a total of 26 stations sanctioned in Kozhikode 14 will be operated by KSEB empanelled agencies. Six stations will be run directly by the KSEB and six other stations will be operated by private parties.

The vehicle stations are being planned to aim to promote the use of electric vehicles in the state. The stations will provide safe, reliable, accessible, and affordable charging infrastructure.

The station will have exclusive transformer, substation equipment and safety appliances. The station will have 14x7 metre area to accommodate the vehicles.

Apart from Kozhikode, other cities in the district will also get vehicle charging stations. The central government has given nod for 131 charging stations across Kerala. Kochi will get the maximum number of stations- 150. While Kannur will get 27 charging stations Thrissur will get 28 stations.

We do not expect many to turn up to the charging stations in the beginning as the number of electric vehicles is minimal, said Bose Jacob. More number of people will come up to purchase electric vehicles only if there are sufficient number of charging stations , he said adding that the initiative is aimed at promoting eco-friendly e-vehicles .

The state government has also issued direction to give fresh permit only to green auto rickshaws in Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode, said the official. The charging stations would be helpful to the e-auto owners, he added.

NEW DELHI: An inter-faith delegation comprising spiritual leaders and social reformers met minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy on Wednesday to purportedly express solidarity with the government's decision to bring the Citizenship Amendment Act in aid of persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

A home ministry release issued after the interaction said the delegation members - Jain Acharya Dr Lokeshji, meditation guru Swami Deepankar, Mufti Shamoon Qasmi, Sardar Sant Singh, Veer Chakra awardee Col (Retd) T P Tyagi, Vineet Kumar and Gautam - ""expressed solidarity with the government and faith in its policies"".

The delegation, which called on Reddy amid ongoing protests in different parts of the country against CAA, unanimously affirmed that the CAA concerns only foreign immigrants and no Indian, from whichever religion, caste, color or creed, has anything to fear, said the release. Highlighting the principles of dharma and ahimsa, the delegation affirmed its belief that the legislation was born out of humanitarian concerns for those who had fled to India from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh fearing religious persecution.

The delegation, according to the home ministry, said India being a land of mutual acceptance and harmony, protests against a decision that aims to alleviate the suffering of such uprooted families, were unacceptable. The legislation is based on a perfect rationale and objective premise, the members were quoted as saying.

The delegation members are said to have declared their intention to urge people to guard themselves against ""misinformation meant to destabilise our foundations of mutual respect and acceptance"".

The spiritual men also expressed their desire to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah ""with this message of peace and solidarity,"" stated the home ministry.

Jaipur: The previous BJP government gave much impetus to Bhamashah health insurance scheme over the free medicine scheme of the earlier Congress government.

It increased the budgetary allocation from Rs 213 crore under the Bhamashah scheme in 2015-16 to a whooping Rs 1,491 crores in the election year 2018-19.

During the same period, the allocation for free diagnostics, free medicine has jumped by Rs 29 crore and Rs 142 crore, respectively.

Rajan Chaudhary, a healthcare expert, said Bhamashah was an attempt to privatise healthcare and to pass the onus on private players. “Raje government made all attempts to pass on the healthcare system into the hands of private players through insurance companies. I demand that present government should respect the mandate and hold fair inquiry on how the budget under this head was used on how many patients were benefitted,” said Chaudhary.

The present government, however, has slashed the budget from Rs 1,491 crore to Rs 631 crore but has also reduced the fee medicine scheme budget from Rs 557.09 crore to Rs 556.43 crore.

Gehlot government has merged the central government’s Ayushman Bharat scheme and the Bhamashah scheme to introduce a new scheme called Bhamshajh Ayushman Bharat Mahatma Gandhi Rajasthan Health Insurance scheme. The activist further says that state has to introduce steps like social auditing and community monitoring so that misuse should be stopped and resources would be utilised properly.

TRICHY: The nationwide strike called by various trade unions did not affect normal life as government and private buses, autos, taxies and trucks operated as usual. However, banks, insurance, post and BSNL offices remained closed though 90% of shops and commercial establishments remained open.

Police arrested 3,372 protestors from across the central region as they tried to stage protests including rail and road roko as part of the strike on Wednesday.

In a letter to Yechury, committee member and Anweshi chairperson K Ajitha said there was a provision in the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) to request the Centre to return the case to state police.

“There is a definite provision in the NIA Act that allows the state government to conduct investigation even in the case of offences scheduled under the NIA Act. Specifically, Section 7 (b) allows to ‘transfer the case to the state government for investigation and trial of the offences’,” the letter said.

Ajitha said initially the CPM was sympathetic towards the youths who have been accused of links with the Maoists and had condemned the invocation of the UAPA in the case. The party had promised to have a re-look into the case and some party leaders had even visited their houses.

Moreover, the chief minister had assured the youths’ families of that the committee set up to review UAPA cases in the state will have a close look at the case, kindling the hopes of dropping of the charges, Ajitha said.

The CPM state committee and the LDF convener were also against the invocation of the UAPA against the youths, Ajitha said. In the meantime, the NIA took over the case and the chief minister made a U-turn in his approach. He said in the assembly and at a press conference that the youths were indeed Maoists, she said.

Ajitha said the country has been passing through difficult times, which warrant a joint agitation. But the state government’s attitude has been dampener, she said, adding that popular support to the CPM and the government has eroded and that several activists and cultural leaders have raised concern over the Left government’s stand.

261,['9/01/2020'],Vasundhara Raje govt spent only 50% of capital fund on med upkeep,"Vasundhara Raje

JAIPUR: Almost 50% of the capital fund under the health budget meant for upgrading medical equipment, facilities and constriction in the government hospitals remained unutilised during the regime of former chief minister Vasundhara Raje .The preliminary reports into the death of infants in J K Lon Hospital blamed poor infrastructure which piled up over the years. Figures from the state budget pages say that nearly 50% of the capital fund was utilized from 2014-15 till 2017-18.For instance, in 2014-15 financial year, the total capital fund allocated was Rs 1,073 crore, while the amount utilised was just Rs 484 crore. The sorry state of affairs doesn’t stop here. In 2017-18, the total capital fund allocated was highest till date of Rs 1,330.62 crore, while the amount spent was Rs 657.54 which constitute for about 40.84% amount utilised in the year.“The apathy by the previous government in the spending the capital fund has created a wide gap in upgrading of the medical equipment and strengthening facilities right from Primary Health Centres to Dispensaries and from satellite hospitals to civil hospitals,” said Nisar Ahmed of Budget Analysis Rajasthan Centre (BARC).The draft of documents of 2018-19 also presents the bleak picture about the spending of the capital fund. Reports have suggested that death in JK Lone Hospital in Kota is also due to shortage of heaters, warmers, oxygen kits, shortage of medical equipment in ICU and wards, broken windowpanes, lack of hygiene and improper water outlets.Former health minister Kalicharan Saraf (December 2016 till the term ended) has refused to own up the responsibility of amount under the important component being unused.“I am a politician and can track figures. If the capital fund is not spent fully during my tenure, it should be asked to the then health officials Naveen Jain and Veenu Gupta,” said Saraf.TOI repeatedly called health minister Raghu Sharma for his reaction but got no response. Going by the admission of the Sharma, several equipment have become non-functional due to lack of maintenance.“Capital fund is required for the regular maintenance of the machines some of which are in tune of crores of rupees,” said Mukesh Goswami of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan , who is also advocating for right to health.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73165816,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-799464,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raje-govt-spent-only-50-of-capital-fund-on-med-upkeep/articleshow/73163423.cms
262,['9/01/2020'],Newly launched Cheetah patrol squads turn toothless,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Just a week into its launch, the city police have trimmed the number of Cheetah Patrol teams from ten to just two.

The patrols were introduced to improve traffic law enforcement on city roads and were flagged off by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on New Year’s Day. Besides reducing the number of patrols, new city commissioner Balram Kumar Upadhyay has also brought their activities directly under his control.

Under the original plan, the patrols were to function under the two assistant commissioners (North and South) of the city traffic division.

Speaking to TOI, commissioner Upadhyay said the changes will not affect traffic law enforcement.

‘’The city traffic division already has four law enforcement squads and their duties overlap with those of the Cheetah Patrols,’’ said Upadhyay.

Upadhyay said the city police would strive to achieve 100% compliance with helmet and seatbelt rules. The Cheetah Patrols would conduct surprise inspections, the city commissioner said.

‘’There are people who wear helmets when they see officers conducting inspections and would remove them as soon as they reach the next junction. Cheetah Patrols will target such motorists. They may conduct checks at one place and then shift to another place the very next minute,” the commissioner said.

However, this surprise nature will not conflict with the existing directions of the state police chief regarding on-road inspections that forbid officers from pouncing on motorists, leading to accidents.

The Cheetah Patrols were envisioned by state police chief Loknath Behera after he held a meeting with residents two months ago to hear their woes and concerns related to vehicular traffic in the city.

Former commissioner MR Ajithkumar was tasked with preparing a detailed report and he proposed 10 teams. He also mobilised ten sub inspectors to lead the patrols.

It is learned that Behere ratified the decision to cut down the number of patrols with an aim to expand the project to other police districts. The officers who were selected for the squad may be redeployed to other police districts soon in this connection.

Meanwhile, there are also rumours that the focus on ‘law enforcement’ was only a ruse to use police personnel to increase penalising motorists and thereby increase collection of petty charges.

There are several officers in the department worried that this would only result in adversely affecting the cordial relationship between police and public.

Trichy: As samba paddy harvest is round the corner in Lalgudi block in Trichy district, farmers in the area have appealed to the district administration to open direct procurement centres (DPCs) as soon as possible.

Unlike other blocks in the district, farmers in Lalgudi largely take up samba paddy cultivation every year due to their access to borewell water. This year hundreds of farmers have taken up samba paddy cultivation for the season as rain, Cauvery water and water from other irrigation channels were favourable, agriculture officials said.

Now the crop is ready for harvest. There is a possibility that the harvest would begin from January 10, farmers said.

Lalgudi is the only area where a considerable number of farmers takes up samba irrespective of water released from Mettur dam for delta cultivation. Farmers from Lalgudi largely rely on borewells, said state spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam N Veerasekaran.

“Once harvest is started, farmers have no option but to sell their produce in the open market for low price, as no DPC is functioning in Lalgudi block. Usually Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) open around 15 DPCs in Lalgudi block to help farmers from being cheated,” he said.

Meanwhile, officials from district administration said that once they get instructions form the collector, the TNCSC authorities would open the required number of DPCs in Lalgudi.

266,['9/01/2020'],Plan to raze Tagore’s Puri house hits opposition wall,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Bhubaneswar: Opposition from locals has forced the Puri district administration to do a rethink on its plan to raze the century-old house of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore at Chakratirtha Road, in Puri. “It is an unsafe building. But we are sensitive to its legacy and heritage. We will see what best can be done in this regard,” Puri district collector Balwant Singh assured on Wednesday.

The change of heart follows protest from locals, prominent individuals and members of the state chapter of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH).

“Tagore was in love with this place. He had penned several poems here during his stay. Tagore had renovated Patherpuri House. This should be restored instead of demolishing it,” heritage expert and historian Anil Dhir said.

The building has a bust of the poet. “There are several documents and articles penned by Tagore that are still there in the house. Though some of these documents have been lost due to lack of maintenance, some of the writings still remain,” Dhir added. A portion of the house is being used as a hostel of the local Samanta Chandra Sekhara Junior College. The building is dilapidated and its foundation got further weakened by Cyclone Fani that hit Puri on May 3 last year. The wind also blew away the roof of the building. This led the state works department to declare the building unsafe.

A senior teacher at Samanta Chandra Sekhara Junior College said they have requested the works department to restore the building and turn it into a museum to preserve the documents and artifacts.

Priyadarshan Patnaik, a convener of Shree Jagannath Sena, said the state government should preserve the heritage building instead of demolishing it. “The government can convert Patherpuri House into a museum. Tagore had composed several literary works, including a portion of Gitanjali, during his stay here. We should respect his legacy by restoring the building,” Patnaik said.

Amiya Bhusan Tripathy, state convener of INTACH, said his organization has requested chief minister Naveen Patnaik to restore and conserve Tagore’s house. “If the government wants, INTACH can give a new lease of life to Paherpuri House,” Tripathy said. He said Kanika Library and Assembly Hall at the iconic Ravenshaw University, the Cuttack Circuit House and the old Board of Revenue Building too were at declared unsafe, but have now been restored with INTACH’s help.

PANAJI: The death toll of tigers rose to four in the state within four days, after a tiger cub was found buried, while, a few meters away, the carcass of the mother tigress was discovered in a decomposed condition by forest officials on Wednesday. Earlier, on January 7, combing operations by forest officials had found a dead cub.

The combing operations were launched after the carcass of a four-year-old male tiger was first spotted on January 5, in the forest of Golauli in Sattari taluka.

Though forest officials said the tigers were most probably killed after feeding on a poisoned buffalo, postmortem carried out on three of the tiger carcasses have shown no evidence of death due to poisoning.

“There is possibility that the tigers died due to poisoning, but so far we have not found evidences. Our investigation is in process. After forensic reports are available, reason for the death of the tigers would be known. On Thursday, postmortem of the fourth tiger (the cub found on Wednesday) will be carried out,” deputy conservator of forests Vikas Desai said.

Police too were involved in the investigations, with the dog squad being brought at the spot where the tiger carcasses were found inside the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. But as a week had passed since the deaths, the dogs could not provide any leads.

After Dr Harsh Bathini conducted postmortem of the female cub and the mother tigress on Wednesday, it was reported that all the claws and teeths were intact. In case of one of the earlier tiger carcasses, claws were missing.

The reports of four tiger deaths are unprecendented in Goa and has left wildlife conservationists and residents of nearby areas in shock.

It is believed by some that the recent killing of domesticated animals in the area could have lead to the tigers being poisoned. A case has been registered against unidentified persons under the Wildlife Protection Act and four suspects have been rounded up.

“Goa government does not have any concrete plans in place for protection of the tigers in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. On December 23, a tigress with three cubs were captured by a camera trap. Earlier, on December 22, a cow from the nearby settlement had been killed and, on December 30, a buffalo had been killed. In this scenario, officials should have planned a strategy to avoid anguish of the locals,” said Amrutsingh, who heads Animal Rescue Squad.

Resident of Bhuipal village in Sattari, Suryakant Gaonkar, told TOI, “The death of four tigers is indeed shocking. For the first time, we have seen how treacherously the tigers have been killed and attempts have been made to destroy the evidences. This is painful. The forest department has to investigate the matter thoroughly and has to plan mitigation measures on warfooting to protect the remaining tigers in the Mhadei sanctuary. The man-tiger conflict should be dealt with properly to avoid the repetition of such tragic misdeed.”

Last year, the Wildlife Institute of India census had reported the presence of three tigers in the Goa corridor. Forest officials later said that the tiger number was up to five in the Goa corridor, based on the tigers captured on the camera trap, after the census period.

TRICHY: This Pongal too, sugarcane cultivated by the inmates of Trichy central prison on its campus will be available for the people to taste. Cultivated on 1.25 acres, the fully grown sugarcane is ready for harvest and the first lot was cut from the fields here on Wednesday.

Deputy inspector general, prisons, Trichy range G Shanmugasundaram and the officials have planned the cut in a way that the sugarcane reaches the people in time for Pongal. The prison authorities have already received an order for the canes from the state government to be included in the Pongal gift hamper.

“We estimate that 35,000 to 40,000 pieces of 2-foot-long sugarcane will have to be supplied to the cooperative department for Pongal gift hamper. The pieces will be ready to use as the prisoners will clean them completely,” said office superintendent of central prison A Thirumurugan.

The cultivation of the sugarcane commenced in April 2019 though the area of cultivation was reduced to 1.25 acres from 2 acres in previous years. The prison authorities said they applied organic fertilizers to the cultivation besides a negligible amount of pesticide on the advice of agriculture department officials. It was the hard work of 20 prisoners, handpicked by the authorities based on their good conduct, that resulted in the good harvest, said Thirumurugan. DIG Shanmugasundaram said the rest of the sugarcane will be distributed among prison staff and prisoners.

Authorities estimate the sale of sugarcane to fetch an income of Rs 2.5 lakh this year. Officials said 20% of the income will be split so as to give 80% of it to the prisoners and 20% to the victim relief fund. The cultivation of sugarcane, brinjal, lady’s finger, small onion and several other garden plants is also in full swing on the 100 acres of vacant land on the prison campus. A total of 60 prisoners are involved in agricultural activities.

Besides good conduct, the willingness of prisoners and their previous experience in agriculture are also taken into consideration before involving them in the work. DIG Shanmugasundaram said that small onion will be ready for harvest in 20 days.

Thiruvananthapuram: ‘Compostable’ plastic bags may be used only as an alternative for garbage bags, the environment department said. With the department issuing a clarification on use of compostable substitutes, the city corporation is likely to take steps to regulate the inflow of carry bags labelled as ‘compostable’.

On Sunday, TOI had reported on how the lack of clarity over use of compostable carry bags led to hoarding of these bags by merchants in the city.

According to the environment department, compostable plastic can only be used as a substitute for garbage bags made of plastic, including for hospital use.

The department has also enlisted various non-plastic substitutes for banned plastic carry bags, non-woven bags, plastic packets, plastic drinking water pouches and plastic sheets.

Cloth and paper bags have been recommended as a non-plastic substitute for banned covers, bags and packets made of plastic and compostable plastic is not included under the list of alternatives.

New guidelines have been mandated for compostable materials. It shall bear details of the company that manufactures, the agency that markets, the material specification, date of manufacturing, batch number and approval details of the Central Pollution Control Board.

CPCB approval with licence number and validity may be given in the form of QR code. Further, the environment department has mandated that the compostable carry bag shall dissolve in dicholoromethane (methylene dichloride) and this shall be indicated in the packaging bag/cover/sheets as a preliminary test for identification.

Earlier, the government had issued an order exempting plastic products made of compostable plastic from the ban. The order had noted that it should bear the compostable’ label ‘and conform to IS/ISO 17088: 2008 titled as specification for ‘compostable plastic’ as defined in the Plastic Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2016.

Meanwhile the city corporation has sold over 25,000 cloth bags since the plastic ban came into effect. A government department alone placed an order for 12,000 bags.

The return counter set up by the civic body for merchants to hand over banned plastic carry bags also received over 3 tons of banned items.

Segregated plastic bags ideal for shredding will be sold to Clean Kerala Co Ltd at a rate of Rs 18 per kg.

JAIPUR: The nationwide strike call given by 10 central trade unions drew mixed response in Rajasthan on Wednesday with banking and roadways services remaining partially affected. However, most of the markets in the state, schools and colleges remained opened. Disruption to public transport services was minimal.

Mahesh Mishra, general secretary of Rajasthan Pradesh bank employees union, said, “Direct and indirect banking business to the tune of Rs 10,000 crore got affected today due to the strike. Of the total nearly 25,000 bank employees in the state, almost 20,000 joined the strike.”

“Of the total employees, there are nearly 3,000 employees affiliated with CITU in roadways who are participating in the Bharat bandh,” Kishan Singh Rathore , general secretary of Rajasthan roadways workers' union (CITU), claimed.

Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot said that the Centre should take cognisance of the nationwide strike called by labour unions, saying every section of the country was dissatisfied due to a communication gap.

“You (Centre) will not communicate, you will not explain, you will not try to understand people, then what is the meaning of democracy ?” Pilot asked. “Winning an election does not mean that you have become supreme. We should keep our hearts, minds and ears open, and listen to people.”

Pilot said the government should leave its “ego” behind and hold a dialogue.

The central trade unions organised the protest against labour reforms, FDI, disinvestment, corporatisation and privatisation policies of the government. The demands included minimum wage and social security for the working class.

Similarly, thousands of workers of textile and cement industries, krishi mandis also participated in the strike in different parts of the state.

Jaipur: The high-powered committee meeting held on Wednesday under the chairmanship of chief secretary D B Gupta has recommended to the government to go for a Dassault Falcon jet for the use of VVIPs in the state. The pane is expected to cost about Rs 214 crore.

Sources said all the leading manufacturers had responded to an expression of interest invited by the state aviation department. But what went in favour of Dassault Falcon was its ability to withstand the acute hot weather conditions and operate in shorter air strips.

An official privy to the meeting said, “Bombardier and Dassault were the two contenders. What went is favour of Dassault was its suitability to operate in extreme weather conditions.”

The Rajasthan government owns two aircraft and an Augusta helicopter. One aircraft is 28 years old while the other is around 17 years old. The Augusta helicopter was grounded after it suffered a technical glitch in November 2011. The government has been hiring jet planes for VVIP movement ever since the Augusta helicopter was grounded, which according to officials cost around Rs 4 lakh per hour. The acquisition of another state pane has been a long overdue. The previous Raje government had also planned to buy a plane , but it did not take off. It was during Raje's tenure that the controversial Augusta helicopter was acquired.

DEHRADUN: The friends and teachers of Nirbhaya, the Delhi gang rape victim, hailed the Supreme Court’s decision of sticking to its capital punishment verdict in the case. “The punishment to these men is a lesson to all those who even think of doing such heinous crimes. We stand by Nirbhaya 's parents, as always, in their quest of justice,” said Harish Arora, head of the city-based institute from where the 23-year-old victim completed her paramedical course.

The institute, where Nirbhaya studied for four years, now gives scholarship in her name to girls who hail from poor socio-economic background. According to the institute officials, around 25 girls have been given scholarships since 2012. “We give scholarship of Rs 4-Rs 5 lakh to girl students from poor economic background. Every year, around 5 to 8 girls get to avail this grant. They just have to pay Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000 for the entire course,” said Arora, while adding that her friends and teachers are also content with the court’s verdict. Speaking to TOI, other teachers who taught her said she was a brilliant student and highlighted that she scored really well in her last examinations, whose results were declared after her demise. ""Supreme Court upholding its verdict is a strong message to those who commit such heinous crimes. Our faith in the judiciary has been reinstated. I feel that now, those who even think of raping women will fear the consequences of committing such a crime,” said Jitendra Singha, one of the teachers of the institute.

Earlier on Tuesday, SC had issued death warrant for four convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape case. Their execution will be held on January 22 at 7 am in Tihar jail. The court said that the convicts can use their legal remedies within 14 days. The order was pronounced by Additional Sessions Judge Satish Kumar Arora who issued death warrants against them. The four convicts are — Mukesh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Singh, and Pawan Gupta.

DEHRADUN: In a move to reduce the use of papers in official works, Uttarakhand witnessed its first e-cabinet meet on Wednesday. One of the decisions of the cabinet was to double the grant given to people of Uttarakhand going on Kailash Mansarovar Yatra. The meet also paved way for the recruitment of guest lecturers by colleges, which were short of teachers, for a period of 11 months.

Sharing the information, urban development minister Madan Kaushik said, “Earlier, a grant of Rs 25,000 was given to people of Uttarakhand going on Kailash Mansarovar Yatra. The cabinet has given nod to a proposal to double the grant amount to Rs 50,000.”

There are many degree colleges, which have seats of teachers lying vacant. “To ensure that the education of students is not impacted, we have allowed the colleges to recruit guest lecturers for a period of 11 months. Each lecturer would be given Rs 500 per class and each day the guest lecturer is expected to take two classes.”

The cabinet also approved the support price for sugarcane, which had been announced earlier. The government had fixed the price at Rs 317 (normal variety) and Rs 327 (high quality variety) per quintal.

Till now only women and members of SC community availed the benefits of Ganga Gai Mahila Yojana. Making an amendment, the cabinet decided to extend the benefits to all members of co-operative societies. “Priority in this regard would always be given to women members,” Kaushik said.

Earlier, the state government had given approval for the construction of disaster-affected houses in Kedarpuri through CSR funds. “The cabinet has made a slight amendment and added that now the state government, through its resources, can also build houses damaged in Kedarpuri,” Kaushik said.

Speaking about the e-cabinet, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said, “The motive is to promote paperless transactions, time-bound completion of projects and prepare a data base. With technology, it would be easier to check the decisions taken in the past. Personnel department will also come up with a portal for e-cabinet.

NAINITAL: The state government on Wednesday informed the Uttarakhand high court (HC) that it will install a ‘prison inmate calling system’ in all jails in the state within three months.

281,['9/01/2020'],Keralites prefer brandy to rum,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The sales figures of Kerala State Beverages Corporation (BEVCO) with respect to the market share of IMFL sales in the state shows a change in the drinking pattern in the last one decade. According to the figures, brandy is steadily grabbing the market instead of rum that once used to be the hit favourite of Keralites, indicating the change of trend in consumers’ drinking preferences in the last one decade.

At the same time, the market share for vodka, whiskey and gin and wine are a meagre figure. The rum brands, which accounted for about 52% of the market share till 2010, has steadily dropped over the past nine years and now stands at 43%. Brandy has picked up gains and now boasts of 51% share in the state’s liquor market.

BEVCO attributes one of the reasons behind this trend to the rise in the price of the extra neutral alcohol (ENA), the major ingredient for manufacturing the Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), of late. Though both IMFL varients use ENA, rum brands are usually cheaper than brandy brands, prompting the manufacturers to push for brandy brands.

“BEVCO had revised the rates of IMFL by only a meagre figure in the last many years, but the price of ENA has been spiralling upwards. Due to this reason, suppliers also prefer to supply brandy more than rum, which is generally cheaper,” former managing director of BEVCO and former excise commissioner Anil Xavier said. BEVCO sources say that rum brands are having a huge demand in the market, but are not available in adequate supply.

At the same time, vodka, whiskey and gin together accounts for only 6% of sales. While whiskey sales account for 4%, others together constitute only 2% sales.

The whiskey brands have also had a decline in the market share over the years. “There was a time when the market share of whiskey was as high as 16%, which is now only 4% which shows the change in drinking preferences,” sources said. But this trend is against likely to change. With the state’s liquor market now open for foreign made foreign liquor (FMFL), those preferring whiskey brands are now opting for more FMFL brands. “Whiskey is an expensive drink of the lot, and majority of those who are spending on Whiskey are now opting for FMFL as better products are available in FMFL. So a change in the sales pattern will be visible in the coming few years,” sources added. There are 306 retail outlets under BEVCO in the state.

Ahmedabad: Billiards maestro Geet Sethi rates Mike Russell as the best among the players he has played with. The rivalry between Sethi and Russell was a riveting feature of billiards in the 1990s.

I rate Russell as the best as far as having the calibre on the table is concerned, said Geet, one of the greatest sporting talents India has ever produced, on the sidelines of the 6Red Snooker tournament in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.

“Russell and myself used to have umpteen breaks of 700-800 during our peak days. In the present era, I consider Pankaj Advani, who has been dominating the sport for long, an absolute champion material. He is a class apart and has won a high number of titles. He has the metal toughness to be the No. 1 in the country.”

On his comeback to the green baize, Geet said he realised last year that he needed to keep playing. ""I felt that my body had lost some of the agility and I wanted to get some exercise and bring some rhythm back into the body. That's how it started and I got hooked to the game again.""

“Recently, I had a break of over 500 during a practice session in Dubai and am very pleased that I am getting back into shape,” said the maestro who considers his break of 1276 during the World Billiards Championship as the high point of his illustrious career.

Geet is happy that the cue game has picked up in Gujarat in the last few years. “It is very pleasing to see that in the last seven-eight years, there has been a rise in snooker centres all over the state like in Rajkot, Vadodara and Surat,” said Sethi.

Geet feels Ahmedabad’s Dhvaj Haria is the future of Gujarat in the sport.

“Dhvaj has been the runner-up at the national billiards championship in the last two years. He works hard and is talented. Recently Dhvaj has beaten Pankaj in two back-to back tournaments and this augurs well for him,’’ said Geet.

JAIPUR: The Government Medical College in Kota is planning to double its bed capacity from existing 157 to 313. This comes after TOI’s report ‘Kota’s JK Lon Hospital needs 300 more beds for ailing children’ published on January 6.

The death of 100 children in JK Lon Hospital in December last year had exposed shortage of equipment, staff and bed capacity in the institute. In 2019, 16,892 patients were admitted to the hospital.

Informing about the shortage of beds, Government Medical College principal and controller Vijay Sardana said the move to increase the beds have started. “We are preparing a proposal of adding another 156 beds, which include 90 general ward beds, 36 in neonatal ICU and 30 in paediatric ICU,” Sardana said.

TOI had highlighted that up to three children are cramped on a single bed at the hospital. Since the facility cannot deny treatment to patients coming in critical condition, they accommodate more than one child on one bed, which puts a child at higher risk of getting infected from other patients getting treatment on the same bed.

JK Lon Hospital officials said if 156 more beds were added, the capacity would get doubled. The health department will rope in the public works department to finalise the budget needed to increase the capacity.

According to a 2017 report of the hospital’s paediatric department, a copy of which is with TOI, the facility needs 300 more beds to cater to ailing kid population in Kota, Baran, Bundi and Jhalawar . The hospital’s move to increase the number of beds has been decided keeping in mind the availability of space with them at 40,000 square-metre sprawling land on which the two-storey building was constructed. However, more than half of the land does not have any construction.

In 2017, the government knew that there is a need for expansion of facilities for paediatric population and it planned a separate Hadauti Institute of Child Health in Kota at a cost of Rs 30 crore, but all that remained on paper. A meeting under the then health minister Kali Charan Saraf was also held and on the basis of that, Hadauti Institute of Child Health was planned.

Pune: India’s annual public spending on education — at just 0.45% of the gross domestic product (GDP) — is inadequate to meet the goal of quality education for the country’s burgeoning and world’s largest young population, said education rights activist Sharad Javadekar of the Akhil Bharatiya Samajwadi Adhyapak Sabha.

He recently presented the education perspective of the budgetary allocations for the sector, at the Jan Arth Sankalpa budget series seminar. He said India’s allocation severely dwarfed in comparison to the global average and even when compared to other economically challenged countries.

Citing the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) data, he said even the relatively economically-backward countries such as Kenya, Namibia, Botswana spent over 7% of their GDP on education.

He said the government needed to increase the allocation to 6% of the GDP to undo the neglect of the sector over decades and raise funds for the same by undoing multiple corporate sops.

India’s proposed spend of Rs94,854 crore in the budgetary allocations of the current financial year, was an increase of 13% over the previous year’s revised estimates.

Javadekar said that despite the talk of push to education, schools and universities in India continued to have a vacancy of 11 lakh teachers.

“Only when the state funds education, will the state of public education and infrastructure of the institutions improve ... For equality in every sphere of life, publicly-funded institutions are necessary,” he said.

In his presentation, he said that despite social guarantees such as Right to Education, almost thalf the students dropped out between Std I to X.

“The root cause of unequal access to quality education is not teachers, it is the system. For over a decade, teachers have continued to be on contract in many public institutes,” he said.

Isro chairman K Sivan (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) is going to set up its own satellite communication system for constant monitoring and contacting Indian astronauts in space much before the Gaganyaan or manned mission is launched by 2022.

Isro chairman K Sivan told TOI that ""a constellation of two geo satellites constituting the Indian Data Relay Satellite System (IDRSS) will establish the space communication system that will help the Gaganyaan space crew talk to the ground station. The first geo satellite will be launched this year before the first unmanned testflight of Gaganyaan, which is likely to be launched in December or first half of 2021. The second satellite will be launched before the second unmanned testflight next year. Both testflights will carry a humanoid to space.""

The satellites, which will be placed at the geostationary orbit at 36,000 km, will envelop the entire globe and help constant relay of communication from astronauts in space to the earth station without any time lapse.

Without data relay satellites, Isro will have to create a large number of ground stations or hire a foreign communication service otherwise the space crew will not be in contact at all time with ground staff.

All space powers like the US, Russia and European Union, which had launched their own manned missions earlier, have their own space communication systems. The US has American Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, Russia has Luch or Satellite Data Relay Network and Europe has European Data Relay System. China, too, has its Tianlian data tracking system.

Earlier, Isro chairman K Sivan had told TOI though four IAF pilots have been chosen for advanced space training in Russia starting this month, ""there could eventually be only one or three astronauts that will go to space"".

Meanwhile, the Defence Food Research Laboratory in Mysore has prepared special desi food items and developed special containers to help astronauts drink liquids, including water and juices, in space where there is no gravity. Food heaters will also be provided to the space crew.

The extension will provide relief to all the residents.” According to officials, chief registrar of births and deaths had issued directions permitting municipal bodies to issue birth certificates after adding names in the blank column. After the deadline, rules did not permit to add names in the certificate once a citizen reaches 15 years.

A senior official said, “People above 15 years, who do not have their names in the birth certificates, are advised to complete the process. Now, with the extension, residents should add names as per convenience.”TNN

PANAJI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Centre and state governments on separate petitions filed by two mining companies seeking a direction to renew their mining lease up to 2037. The court has sought replies from the government within four weeks.In February 2018, the Supreme Court had quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases and stopped mining activities from March 2018.The petition has been filed against the Union government and the state government. The petitioners asked the SC to direct the state government to direct execute a lease extension deed to its mining lease deed with a new end date of 2037, in terms of Section 8A(3) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.Two mining companies approached the state government to extend their mining leases till 2037 as the life of a mining lease is 50 years. The state government in principle agreed to the request of mining companies but rejected the request of mining companies in lines of the apex court decision.The Union government abolished mining concessions and converted them into leases in 1987, with effect from 1961.“The Abolition Act, which came into force on May 23, 1987, granted deemed mining leases to inter alia the petitioner, while abolishing the mining concessions granted to the petitioner under the erstwhile regime with effect from November 22, 1987, vide Section 5(1) of the Abolition Act. Section 5(2) of the Abolition Act further provided that upon the expiry of a mining lease, the holder of such lease may apply for the renewal thereof in terms of the provisions of the MMDR Act,” states the petition.The petitioner stated that prior to the interruption and shutdown of mining in the state, Goa’s mining industry contributed well over 15% of the state GDP output. However, due to intermittent mining operations between 2014 and 2018, this contribution reduced to about 1%, and post April 2018, this figure reduced to nil, which has had severe consequences on the Goan economy.The petitioners said that the unemployment rate in Goa in 2019 was 34.5%, ie, the highest in the country. Moreover, only about 10% of the affected persons (approximately 1.5 lakh individuals) had managed to find alternative sources of livelihood. Increased and prolonged unemployment has also had a negative psychological and social impact on the population.“The shutdown of mining activities has resulted in a sharp drop of income levels ranging from 30-50%, and has affected over 3,00,000 households in Goa. The average monthly income, savings and expenditure have also witnessed a major drop after the stoppage of mining activities,” the petitioner said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73165123,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-830990,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sc-issues-notices-to-centre-state-as-mining-cos-seek-lease-renewal/articleshow/73162546.cms
290,['9/01/2020'],"Collect OBC data in Census ’21, Maha resolution urges Centre","This story is from January 9, 2020

MUMBAI: The state legislative assembly on Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution asking the Centre to add an Other Backward Classes (OBC) column in the census to be launched in 2021.

The Union home ministry had issued a statement in 2018 that OBC data would be collected in Census 2021 , but there is still no clarity on whether it will be done. The Census pre-test apparently did not collect the information. Published caste numbers were last collected under the British in 1931.

The resolution was moved suo motu by Speaker Nana Patole and unanimously passed by the lower House. ""I feel there is a need for a caste column for 'OBC' in the form for the census that will start in 2021. This will help us find out the population of OBCs in the state correctly,"" said Patole, while speaking during a special one-day session of the assembly.

However, deputy CM Ajit Pawar said the issue could be discussed in the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) first and then taken up in the budget session beginning next month. Parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab also said only the business finalised by the BAC for the day should be taken up by the House.

At this point, Patole said taking up the issue (caste-based Census) next month would be too late. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the Opposition would support such a resolution. ""Different figures regarding the OBC population in the state are given, making it very difficult to plan policies for that section of the society. Budgeting and planning can be done when we have the correct numbers,"" said Fadnavis.

Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal of NCP said the demand for a caste-based census had been long pending. ""We are still planning welfare schemes for OBCs in the state based on some British-era figures. There is definitely a need to have a fresh census to know the exact number of the community,"" said Bhujbal. After this, the House passed the resolution by voice vote.

Bengaluru: Tension prevailed outside Jyoti Nivas College in Koramangala on Wednesday after a few men put up a banner endorsing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on the institution’s compound and allegedly tried to force a few girl students to sign on it.

According to sources, students leaving the campus around 4.30pm were accosted by CAA supporters who began forcing them to sign on a flex banner put up on the college wall. When some students objected, the activists insisted they sign it.

Parinitha (name changed) told TOI: “When I declined to sign the banner, a few men began shouting at me in abusive language. As they continued to shout at us, many students gathered and questioned the men about their conduct. One of our professors heading out for a tea break noticed the commotion and came to the spot. He made several attempts to defuse the situation, but they did not heed his pleas,” she said.

The professor, who didn’t want to be identified, said, “The men held up a poster which had pictures of Union home minister Amit Shah, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya. The men also handed out pamphlets to students and told them to sign the petition,” said the professor.

Jyoti Nivas College student union president Rebecca Raj told TOI: “The pro-CAA men were pressurising my collegemates to sign the petition. Due to the chaos, the girls were able to leave the college only at 5.30pm.”

Koramangala police said when they rushed to the spot when they heard about the incident and brought the situation under control. A police officer said there was no case registered in this matter.

BALANGIR: As usual, there was a long queue outside the ticket counter of the outpatient department at Santha Bhima Bhoi Medical College and Hospital in Balangir . People had travelled long distances to see the doctors. Suddenly there was a murmur. Standing in the queue was tourism minister Jyoti Prakash Panigrahi, who had come to review the hospital facilities as part of ‘Mo Sarkar’ and instead of walking straight inside, decided to stand in the line. Odisha Tourism Corporation chairman Shrimayee Mishra was also present.

Panigrahi said he waited for his turn like other patients. “I had some orthopaedic problem and the doctor advised him to get an X-ray done,” Panigrahi said.

Dr Gopabandhu Patra, who saw Panigrahi said the minister has tennis elbow and he advised him to do an X-ray and then consult a specialist.

“Initially I could not recognize him. But when the dean, superintendent and the media entered the outpatient ward, I realized that the tourism minister had come,” Patra said.

Panigrahi visited different wards of the hospital and talked to the patients and their relatives to inquire about the quality of healthcare facilities in the hospital.

Bablu Patel, who was standing along with the minister in the queue said Panigrahi was wearing a helmet to hide his identity. He waited for his turn in front of the counter as well as the X-ray room.

Mahatma Gandhi stayed in the bungalow for three days in 1934 during his historic Harijan padayatra in Odisha.

Kendrapada: A colonial bungalow at Garapur, on the outskirts of Kendrapada, where Mahatma Gandhi stayed for three days in 1934 during his historic padayatra will be turned into a museum .

“We decided to convert the bungalow into a museum to remind people of the significance of the 1934 padayatra and highlight the Mahatma’s role in the freedom struggle,” said Sashibhusan Behera, former minister and Kendrapada MLA.

On Tuesday, works minister Prafulla Kumar Mallik discussed about the project with the district administration. The building is now under the works department. A counter selling khadi, a photo gallery, a library and conference hall will be part of the proposed museum. “Mahatma Gandhi used tables, chairs and other furniture during his visit to Kendrapada district. The authorities will preserve those in the museum,” said the minister .

The father of the nation stayed in the bungalow from May 27 to May 29, 1934, during his historic padayatra.

“The padayatra is an important event in the country’s freedom struggle. Gandhi allowed dalits to enter temples in some villages during his long walk in Odisha in 1934. He also addressed a public meeting at Garapur on May 28, 1934,” said Nanda Kishor Parida, the former principal of Kendrapada College.

The Mahatma toured different places of Kendrapada during his five-day stay in the district.

He was accompanied by Meera Ben, Gopabandhu Choudhury, Rajkrushna Bose, Rama Devi, a German youth K. Kuto, Uma Bajaj, Binod Kanungo, Surendranath Pattnayak, Manmohan Choudhury and Jadumani Mangaraj, said Dr Basudev Das, a researcher of Kendrapada.

295,['9/01/2020'],I-T settlement panel can resolve foreign black money matters: Gujarat HC,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Gujarat high court

AHMEDABAD: The Income Tax department has lost a case in the Gujarat high court against its own Income Tax Settlement Commission, over entertaining a case of black money in foreign countries held by NRIs, after their firm was named in the Panama papers expose.

In a recent judgment, a bench of Justice H N Devani and Justice S K Vishen rejected a petition filed by the principal commissioner of Income Tax taking exception to an order passed by the settlement commission on full disclosure of foreign income and assets. The I-T department insisted that the owners of the firm were liable to action under the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, and the settlement commission had no power to settle the issue about such black money under the Income Tax Act.

In this case, the Panama papers expose in April 2016 named one Overseas Pearl Ltd, registered in the British Virgin Islands. In October 2016, I-T sleuths raided the premises of Banco Products Ltd, which is the parent company of the firm located in the Virgin Islands, in Vadodara. While the I-T department’s process was under way, the owners of the firm, three brothers – Vimal Patel, Samir Patel and Mehul Patel – approached the settlement commission and disclosed more than Rs 100 crore lying in various countries. They later disclosed more money and in all offered to pay tax on more than Rs 129 crore of undisclosed money. In January 2019, the settlement commission computed tax and interest and ordered the Patel brothers to make payments to the I-T department in four instalments in one year.

The I-T department challenged the settlement commission’s order on the ground that it does not have jurisdiction to settle the issue with regard to undisclosed foreign money and assets, as the Black Money Act bars it from settling the matter. The department contended that the special Black Money Act empowers the department to initiate proceedings against the Patel brothers separately.

In April 2019, the high court stayed the settlement commission’s order for settlement. However, after hearing the case, it upheld the commission’s decision and rejected the I-T department’s case saying that the issue was settled by the commission under the Income Tax Act, which is valid.

The HC pulled up the I-T department for its double stand on the commission’s proceedings, that the revenue department did not act when the commission gave it an opportunity to decide whether the commission should settle the matter, or the I-T department would act under the Black Money Act. In fact, the I-T department invited the commission’s order and later took “a somersault” to say that the commission did not have jurisdiction.

The HC further said that the settlement commission has jurisdiction to settle the issue of foreign undisclosed money under the I-T Act and the Black Money Act does not have any restriction.

296,['9/01/2020'],What have you done to curb sand mining? HC asks Goa,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday asked the state government to indicate the steps being taken to implement its judgment to stop illegal sand mining in Goa.

The Goa River Sand Protection Network (GRSPN) filed a contempt petition in the high court and placed on record several photographs “which suggest that sand mining is continuing and there is at least prima facie some deficit in the manner of action on the part of the authorities”.

The GRSPN said that despite a detailed judgment with directions on December 18 dealing with illegal extraction of sand from Goa’s rivers, the activity has continued unabated and has even increased in some places.

“Five detailed complaints were filed thus far, post the judgement. However, the directions are not being enforced,” states the contempt petition. “Not a single boat has been confiscated, nor truck. Not a single FIR has been filed, though in each area, dozens of persons are involved. Persons owning land on which the illegally extracted sand is stacked are not charged for being in receipt of stolen goods. The scenario is bizarre.” It also states that trucks carrying sand do so openly without fear of authorities.

The network filed complaints on December 24, 26, 27, 29 and 31 and found that violators were alerted in advance before officials from the department of mines and geology visited the site. Following this, complaints were filed with the inspector general of police (IGP) and director of transport.

Trucks usually commence transporting illegal sand from 4am, and long lines of such trucks are a regular sight in some places. Since all this extraction is illegal, it results in a huge loss in revenue to the state.

Visakhapatnam: Residents in the city will soon have more reasons to work out in the open as the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) plans to expand its ‘open air gyms’ initiative in 2020. The initiative is aimed at promoting a healthy lifestyle, free of cost. Sixty-three open air gyms have already been thrown open to the public in parks and other places in the city.

Equipment at the open air gyms range from chest press, double shoulder twirl, double parallel bar, to skywalker and abs board. A visit by TOI to the VMRDA Health Arena early on Wednesday morning saw several people waiting for their turn to use the equipment at the open air gym. GVMC officials said while the gyms are spread across all zones of the city, the densely-populated Zone II has 28 such gyms.

GVMC commissioner G Srijana said the civic body wants to take the initiative forward given the positive public response. “The GVMC has so far developed 63 open gyms, with 374 equipment, in all eight zones of the city. We also want to convert all open places under the GVMC into green spaces. We have already identified 200 places and will soon call for tenders,” said Srijana.

R Narasimham, a private employee in the city, working out on the bench press at Shivaji Park on Wednesday, said the gyms were highly beneficial to the public. “I have been jogging for the last five years. With the open air gym at Shivaji Park, I can now include some variety into my fitness regimen. The best thing about these equipment is that the user’s body weight works as a counterweight,” he said.

N Sandeep, who was trying out the equipment, lauded the initiative. “As these gyms do not have any supervision, the onus lies on the public to properly utilise the equipment to increase their durability,” he said.

As per GVMC tender guidelines, the bidder has to ensure maintenance of the equipment for four years and offer a warranty of one year.

Jaipur: Within a week, six plots at the Khadda Basti in Adarsh Nagar will be auctioned by the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) where once more than 600 families used to reside. All the houses on the land have been cleared by the JMC but two temples and a mosque still stands on the encroached property.

People, who were living in the basti, said that they are demanding separate land for temples and mosque. “We want government to provide separate lands to worship. It would be better for the government to shift these religious structures at Jaisinghpura Khor where we have been given flats. It is a sensitive matter which is why government is taking time to decide,” said Ramesh Kumar, one of the residents who was displaced in October 2017 along with others after the decision of the Rajasthan High Court.

Officials at JMC said that they are still in a dilemma.

An official said, we will take time to deal with the issue. “Rajasthan High Court in 2017 said that the final decision to shift these religious structures will be of the local bodies. All three are illegal structures on the encroached land but people have threatened to protest if one is shifted and not the other,” said the official. There are 50 plots in Jaisinghpura Khor area where more than 1,200 people are residing. Residents claim that though they have been given land, it has become a headache for them.

“Living 15 km from the city where water is scarce and electricity cuts are frequent, it has become difficult for us to survive. The level of fluoride in the drinking water is very high. We have complained many times to the authorities but nothing has been resolved yet,” said Ramesh Kumar, one of the residents who was displaced in October 2017 after the decision of the Rajasthan High Court.

Most of the residents were daily wagers who now have to travel 30 km daily for livelihood. “We have to travel to the city for work and many people have to stop their children’s education as the schools are far away. The area is secluded and nearest population is 4 km away. The government hasn’t helped us even if they claim they will,” said Bhola Ram, a resident of the Khadda Basti.

Panaji: A day before the scheduled start of the folk festival Lokotsav , the directorate of art and culture (DAC) continues to grapple with receiving the necessary permits to hold the ten-day fest in Panaji. The Corporation of the City of Panaji ( CCP ) will meet DAC and Goa police traffic cell officials on Thursday to decide on parking arrangements.

Mayor Uday Madkaikar said that the decision on whether or not an NOC would be granted to the festival will only be taken after the meeting.

“The DAC has submitted a traffic plan to us for parking at SAG grounds. We are calling a meeting with the traffic cell, fire services, officers of DAC and the CCP commissioner on Wednesday to take the final decision on the matter,” Madkaikar told TOI. The festival is scheduled to start on January 10.

Campal residents had held a meeting with the CCP on Monday to complain about the traffic congestion caused in the area owing to the festival, which prompted the CCP to direct the DAC to submit necessary permits by Tuesday or face cancellation of the festival.

The DAC on Tuesday approached the Sports Authority of Goa (SAG) to allot them space at Campal grounds to accommodate vehicles for parking, and were granted the same. On Wednesday, the DAC submitted the parking plans to CCP.

DAC director Gurudas Pilernekar said, “We have got an NOC from SAG and have submitted it to CCP. The fire services have conducted an inspection and the NOC is likely to come on Thursday”.

Dharmesh Angle, DySP (traffic), North Goa, said that some clarifications have been sought from the DAC regarding the parking plan.

“Whatever parking space was available last year (at the SAG football ground), the DAC has taken over to accommodate additional stalls so that place will not be available for vehicle parking this year. They will have to declare their parking area following which we can decide and then process the file,” Angle said.

AHMEDABAD: Brace up for chilling nights for the next 48 hours. The India Meteorological department has predicted that the night temperature in Ahmedabad city is expected to fall by around three degrees and was expected to be around 12C.

According to the IMD Officials, change in wind direction and the morning’s induced cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan and neighbourhood caused the weather change.

In Gujarat , the minimum temperature is likely to drop by 2-3°C,” said an IMD official. He added that the minimum temperature in Ahmedabad city was likely to be around 12 degrees.

On Wednesday, the city had recorded a minimum temperature of 14.8 degrees which was two degrees above normal.

The weathermen predict that from Friday there will be gradual rise in minimum temperature over the region and Ahmedabad. The maximum temperature in the city was 26 degrees which was 1.7 degree below the normal.

The weatherman has forecast dry weather for the next five days in the state. Naliya was the coldest place in the state with a minimum temperature of 10 degrees, followed by Bhuj with 11.4 degrees and Rajkot with 11.8 degrees.

Officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that this trend seems to be here to stay. After a prolonged monsoon, the state seems to be headed for a not-so-cold winter. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, meanwhile, has taken up a drive to ensure that homeless people are shifted to nearby night shelters.

Surat was the hottest city in the state with a minimum temperature of 18.1 degrees while Valsad had a minimum temperature of 17.1 degrees.

JAIPUR: Father of Shweta Tiwari , who was found murdered in her own house on Tuesday, alleged that his daughter and her son were murdered by her husband.

While police have not arrested anyone yet, Shweta’s family is certain that her husband was behind the double murders.

Choking on his tears, her father Suresh Mishra told TOI, “Since my daughter got married in 2011, the couple had been having problems. She often told her mother on how my son-in-law was harassing her. Even after she was killed, he did not call us but instead called one of our relatives.”

After Shweta’s body was found on Tuesday, her son’s body was found on Wednesday afternoon in an open space. It appeared that the accused had not even tried to hide the body but just dumped it in the open.

“My grandson was born nearly seven years after my daughter’s marriage and even after that the couple kept having marital disputes. On January 5, she called and told us that my son-in-law had beaten her up. He also called us and said that we should take her back home to Kanpur otherwise he would kill her,” said Suresh.

The family also gave a written complaint on Wednesday against Shweta’s husband in which they have mentioned the incidents which happened since the couple tied the knot in 2011.

Shweta’s brother, Shubham Mishra also said that her husband was also asking for money from them and said, “In the past also, he had been physically violent with her and few years back, she had returned home to us and stayed for seven-eight months. She had also written to us saying that he was troubling her. My father had some money in the fixed deposit and my brother-in-law was asking for that as well. I cannot think of anyone who would want to kill her and I am certain that he killed both of them. We want police to arrest him and he should be given the maximum punishment.”

Cops are checking the veracity of the allegation but till now have not arrested either the husband or anyone else in the matter. The crime has shocked not just the residents but also police and an official added this kind of brutal murder is very rare especially of the baby and we all are shocked that someone can commit such a crime in broad daylight.

Osmania University students participate in a demonstration against violence on JNU campus.

HYDERABAD: A section of students of University of Hyderabad (UoH), Osmania University (OU), Maulana Azad National Urdu University (Manuu) and the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Hyderabad boycotted classes and held a protest at their campuses in support of the All India General Strike on Wednesday.

Led by UoH students’ union, a rally was held from the Life Sciences building to the main gate. “Our agenda is clear – oppose CAA/NRC, seek employment for all and make universities a safe hub for students where they can voice their opinions,” said UOH student union president, Abhishek Nandan. A section of students from Manuu also participated in the protest by boycotting classes.

At OU, members of the Dalit Minority Students Association burnt effigies of the Bharatiya Janta Party at the Arts College. OU students demanded the release of Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad. The students also organised a protest rally demanding revocation of CAA and NRC at Arts College on Wednesday morning.

TISS students extended their solidarity with Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students as they opposed the CAA and NRC. “The country is under turmoil due to the introduction of sectarian and communally motivated CAA and NRC. These laws are undoubtedly capable of polarising the society and destroy the secular garb of the state,” read a statement issued by TISS students.

While classes were affected in universities, there was no impact in schools and other colleges. Practical exams of class 10 and class 12 students in Central Board of Secondary Education schools went on smoothly in all schools. The Joint Entrance Examinations (Mains) also saw no undue interruptions.

HYDERABAD: As bushfires continue to rage in Australia , Indians are doing their bit to help people whose homes have been destroyed and protect animals who have become the chief victims of the calamity.

With Victoria facing the brunt of the bushfires this month, local Indian-Australian community members have been organising donation camps, food drives and gathering emergency supplies.

One of the most challenging jobs has been that of Karthik Thanigaimani, a volunteer with the Country Fire Authority (CFA), Point Cook Fire Brigade. He has been at the frontline, battling the fires starting from New South Wales. Speaking to TOI, Thanigaimani said he has been part of several ‘strike teams’ trying to prevent the fires from spreading deployed at ground zero for about five days at a time. “At the line of containment, we take up several measures including backburning, a controlled burn mechanism,” he said. The infrastructure architect working for Infosys says he will probably be deployed again soon.

Madhav Vadepalli, who hails from Secunderabad and is an entrepreneur in Melbourne ’s Werribee south, has been gathering relief material for wild animals that have been displaced or injured because of the raging fires. “Many animals such as kangaroos, koalas and possums are being looked after Werribee Open Range Zoo after their habitat was destroyed. Zoo authorities made a plea for cotton or flannelette material to make pouches or wraps for the animals,” Vadepalli said.

According to Vadepalli, the most tragic event of this crisis is that among the animals are rescued, many are still very young. “Joeys (infant kangaroos) need pouches to replicate the feeling of their mothers carrying them,” he said. Vadepalli and other volunteers have been going around collecting material that can be used to help the recovery process.

“We have been collecting tonnes of supplies to help those affected. In fact, now we have been asked to stop since there is not enough storage space. People are being urged to make monetary donations,” said Krishna Ganugapati from Melbourne’s Tarneit, who owns a petrol station in Maffra, close to the fires in East Gippsland region. Several local temples have carried out their own fund-raising activities and restaurants being run by Indians were providing food for those displaced.

Instrumental in the organisational effort has been Karthik Arasu. Though back home on a vacation, his heart has been with those hit by the fires. ""I asked some of my friends to get together and plan the thecamp. Water, non-perishable food, toiletry and other emergency requirements have been a priority.” He added that several local temples have carried out their own fundraising activities and restaurants being run by Indians were providing food for displaced for free.

A GAIL gas yellow safety marker outside an HSR Layout house.

BENGALURU: A resident of Sector 3 in HSR Layout noticed a yellow safety marker carrying GAIL Gas Limited (GGL) markings right outside his home indicating that a PNG line ran under the road. He approached the utility hoping for a new connection.

His application was, however, rejected after preliminary digging in the area made it clear that there was no pipeline running under it. The contractor employed had erroneously installed it there , GAIL claimed.

“The marker, as claimed by a few people, is not fake. It is a genuine GGL safety marker. It has however, been put up in a road which does not have a pipeline running through it — an error on the part of the contractor who was entrusted with the job,” said a GAIL official.

“Three months ago, we issued instructions to all our officers to replace broken or damaged safety markers in the city with new ones. Pipeline works were supposed to be taken up at 15th B Main as per our previous plan. However, BBMP changed the rules last year, which prevents us from carrying out any work on newly asphalted roads for three years. The contractor was not aware of this,” explained the official.

“We have permission to build our network over 100km in HSR Layout. That particular road stretch, however, still does not have a pipeline running under it,” the GAIL official added.

Although GAIL passed the blame on to the contractor, a previous document published by it says: ‘The contractor shall supply, fabricate and install the pipeline markers along the pipeline route. The locations of markers as indicated in the approved drawings shall be treated for guidance purposes only and the exact location shall be based on built drainage and as directed by the company.”.

GGL said all such wrongly installed markers in the city will be removed soon.

About 20 artisans from around Goa will showcase their skills.

PANAJI: Aiming to celebrate those practising traditional crafts , the upcoming edition of Lokotsav will feature one of the biggest stalls dedicated to handloom weaving, woodcraft and pottery.

The section will also feature a live demonstration of these rare crafts, thus giving artisans a platform to spread awareness about their skill while also serving as a potent retail opportunity. About 20 artisans from Pernem, Sakhali and Dharbandora will be given the opportunity to showcase their skills through this platform over the course of the ten-day festival.

Handloom weavers will weave towels and bedsheets made from organic cotton sourced from the National Handloom Development Corporation Ltd while potters will showcase the art of pottery. It will also have bamboo artisans showcasing bamboo craft and handicraftsmen doing woodcraft.

“Since many rural Goans have stopped practicing these crafts, this initiative is an effort towards their revival,” said director of department of handicrafts, textile and coir Arvind Bodge. “The objective behind displaying the skills of these artisans live is to demonstrate to those attending the hand-holding support by the department. It will also create awareness and help develop an interest among other artisans participating in the festival to take up these vocations.”

The items created by the showcasing artisans will also be kept for sale. “The initiative will also open a direct market for artisans wherein we will be connecting consumers directly with manufacturers, thus eliminating the middle man,” Bodge said.

Lokotsav is scheduled to be held at Kala Academy’s Darya Sagar and the Campal ground, Panaji, from January 10 onwards. Artisans from various parts of the country, besides Goa, will be selling their art and craftwork at the 10-day festival.

Workers of Andhra Bank participate in a demonstration in Hyderabad

HYDERABAD: Cab and banking services were partially affected by the nationwide strike called by various trade unions protesting the Union government’s alleged anti-worker policies on Wednesday.

People who commute using app-based cab services faced inconvenience as they were not able to book cabs during early hours of the day.

“Reaching office was a hassle as I was not able to book any cab today. It is particularly difficult to get transport during peak hours in the morning. I was forced to take a bus after repeatedly trying to book a cab for almost half an hour,” said B Jhansi, a resident of Ramnagar. Another commuter, Phani Kumar said: “The cab drivers were not accepting any bookings today. I was fortunate enough to find an auto from my place to the metro station.”

However, with most vehicles including metro rail, buses and autos plying on city roads, there was little impact of the cab strike on transport services.

Meanwhile, operations in all public sector banks in the city also seemed to have been affected during the day.

“Except SBI, most banks have extended their cooperation to the strike and stopped all counter operations such as cash deposits and withdrawals. This affected only those who deal in cash transactions,” said a public sector bank employee on condition of anonymity.

Trade union leaders informed at a protest meeting that the employees of state-owned Singareni Collieries Company and several other workers belonging to various trade unions participated in the strike.

Power sector employees, workers and engineers also went on a strike on a call given by National Coordination Committee of Electricity Employees and Engineers (NCCOEEE), a united platform of unions and federations of electricity employees and engineers.

They have been fighting against the Union government’s move to pass the Electricity (Amendment) Bill as well as other privatisation policies, which they say are against the power utilities, consumers and employees.

310,['9/01/2020'],Student satyagrahis strike an emotional chord in onlookers,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Bengaluru: From sewing the map of India using pieces of clothes to sharing sambar-rice with complete strangers, a 24-hour protest by students against recent hooliganism at Jawaharlal Nehru University ( JNU ), New Delhi, climaxed on a buoyant note on Wednesday at Maurya Circle.

The relay protest — from 6pm on Tuesday to 6pm on Wednesday — was organised and led by students and supported by 'Hum Bharat Ke Log', a federation of more than 50 NGOs, individuals and activists, registered a presence of 1,500 to 2,000 students at any given point of time, organisers said.

The protest was live screened at JNU and Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi through Instagram, which the protesters described as an ‘emotional moment’.

Saqib Idrees, 21, said that following the JNU attack , around 50 students had decided to come together at Maurya Circle and sit down for a long Satyagraha , but the protest snowballed into a massive demonstration defying all expectations.

The overnight satyagraha also saw an exchange of food, help and support from the most unexpected quarters.

“One person saw us standing, sitting and lying down on the road and got a red carpet without any hesitation. Someone set up an extra tent for us free-of-cost. Later in the night, Savera Tea served free tea to 2,000 people. All of this was heart-warming,” Idrees said.

Idrees was also on a hunger strike from 4pm on Tuesday till 4pm on Wednesday and replicated the candle-protest of ‘Shaheen Bagh’ where protesters were seen enduring the pain of melting candle wax on their palms. “I was joined by a stranger. It is symbolic of our movement, which connects us all without any introductions,” he said.

Prachi Shah, a student, said she was at the protest site after 10pm and saw people exchanging packs of biscuits and fruit juice. “Most of them were meeting each other for the first time. Then, a local resident got us sambar and rice,” she said.

“We have had night-outs studying, chatting and partying. Now is the time we spend time doing something worthwhile,” she said, adding that they also educated people around about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The support helped the students stay up the entire night and discuss ideas and compose poetry while making placards.

Zia Nomani, a member of ‘Hum Bharat Ke Log’, said, “The energy was amazing at the protest. We were discussing the life and times of Bhagat Singh and realised his time was different because he was fighting foreigners. Whereas, we are fighting our own people. So, it is important that we show restraint and maintain peace at all costs,” Nomani said.

Deepali Bhardwaj, a student said, “Teachers and professionals too are participating in the protests.” She added that the attack on JNU students has also changed the ideological leanings of some parents she knew, who earlier were against the protests.

Guha joins protest

Historian Ramachandra Guha visited the protest site. “For too long, the western influence has tried to create an artificial divide between the Gandhian and Ambedkar sides. We must realise that they were two individuals who had their disagreements but were united on several things. Like absolute commitment to ending untouchability, commitment to equality and in Gandhi’s case, absolute commitment to Hindu-Muslim unity,” Guha said.

He also asked the students to respect the importance of non-violence, both in action and deeds. “They will call you all kind of things, but don’t speak as they do. Stick to specifics and talk about the discriminatory legislation that the CAA represents, don’t speak of fascism,” he said.

Guha also applauded the diversity of the crowd and asked the students to keep the peaceful tempo of the struggle. “It will be a long arduous struggle, please keep it peaceful,” he said.

HYDERABAD: The Consulate General of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Hyderabad was inaugurated on Wednesday. This will be the country’s second consulate in the country with the first one being in Mumbai. Afghanistan has its embassy in New Delhi.

Stating that the establishment of the consulate will usher in new opportunities, Afghanistan deputy foreign minister Naheed Esar said: “While there exists air connectivity between Kabul, Delhi and Mumbai, we would like to add Hyderabad among the newer destinations in this corridor.” She added that economic ties between the countries would focus in sectors such as transit, energy and trade. Esar invited businesses from the city to establish bases in Afghanistan.

The minister said the establishment of the consulate came at a crucial juncture for Afghanistan, when it is transitioning from being an aid-recipient country to a self-reliant one. Highlighting another dimension of Hyderabad’s relationship with Kabul, state home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali said that there were many Afghan students pursuing their studies here. Besides education he also stressed on the need to build trade ties including in traditional items.

Charge d’affaires of the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, Tahir Qaadiri said that since Hyderabad was known to be an IT hub , it would be interesting to see a ‘silicon valley’ established in Afghanistan as well. “The inauguration of the consulate here will open south India to our nation,” he said and added that a Hyderabad-Jalalabad sister city partnership could be on the horizon. Mohammed Ibrahimkhil of the consulate in Hyderabad said that he looked forward to the deepening of historical ties between the two countries.

HYDERABAD: Many passengers waiting to hire app-based cabs at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) on Wednesday morning faced inconvenience after many drivers switched off their devices, protesting the state and central government’s anti-worker policies. App-based cabs such as Ola and Uber cater to the maximum percentage of airport traffic.

“After waiting for my niece, who was initially stuck for a long time at the baggage collection point, we had to again wait for a cab for a long time. Finally, we hired a radio cab,” said M Yashaswini, a resident of Begumpet. However, services began running as usual after 11am. A video of police officials trying to convince the striking cab drivers to resume their duties also surfaced on WhatsApp groups.

“Nearly 3,000 app-based cab drivers participated in the national trade union strike at Hyderabad airport . The drivers switched off their mobile devices in support of the protest,” said Shaik Salauddin, chairman of the Telangana State Taxi and Drivers’ Joint Action Committee.

However, an RGIA spokesperson said, “We have no reports of inconvenience caused to passengers. Even if there was a problem with app-based cabs, we have radio cabs, Pushpak buses and other transport services at the airport to cater to passengers.”

Contrary to the claim of cab drivers’ association that 3,000 cabs at the airport participated in the strike, the airport spokesperson said that there are only around 500 app-based cabs at RGIA that are constantly shuttling between the city and airport.

Mumbai University

MUMBAI: To send out a strong message to “negligent” paper-setters, Mumbai University , in a rare move, has directed that services of two teachers be terminated and recognition of one be cancelled for three years, for repeating an old question paper for the Master of Computer Application ( MCA ) exam held in December. Till now, the university usually barred teachers from exam work for one to three years for similar “negligence”.

The teachers were in the paper-setting committee of the Statistics and Probability paper for MCA Semester-I students. The exam was held on December 11. The question paper, though, was exactly the same for the exam held on May 23, 2018. The questions throughout the paper were identical with an exception of the last. In the December 2019 paper, the first question is repeated as the sixth. In the May 2018 paper, questions one and six were different. Board of Studies for MCA confirmed the papers were identical.

After the confirmation, the university’s unfair means inquiry committee, after going through due process, decided to cancel the recognition of the paper-setting committee chairman for three years. This would mean that the teacher will not be able to teach for three years. The university has also directed the termination of two other paper-setters in the committee. The names of the teachers are withheld by the university as the examination process is confidential.

An official from the university’s examination section said they hope to send out a strong message to paper-setters. ‘The decision was taken after a thorough inquiry. This move may act as a deterrent for teachers who do not take the examination process seriously. We hope to avoid similar goof-ups in future,” said the official. The university administration has been taking stringent action against defaulting colleges for a year. It even withheld the sanction of a few colleges, which did not complete their quota of paper assessment, which delayed results in the past.

The fiasco is certainly going to be part of the discussion when the state tourism department officials meet their counterparts at the Centre on January 16, said an official.

Despite having selected the implementing agencies through a tender, RTDC is yet to issue work orders for the light & sound show projects.

“This shows all is not well in the tourism department. The minister has written to principal secretary of tourism, who is the chairman of RTDC, to cancel the tenders but there is no compliance of the letter. On the other hand, the RTDC is not issuing work orders to the selected bidders. The ice has to be broken if the government is serious about the project,” said the official.

All along, RTDC has maintained that its tendering process was fair and transparent but it has desisted from issuing work orders so far. “The issue has become a little sticky and only after the chief minister’s office (CMO) interferes, the logjam would end,” said another official.

TOI tried to speak to RTDC (Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation) managing director but he said he is on tour and said can only reply after coming to office.

The turf war has also affected the functioning of the department. The department is yet to finalise the draft for tourism policy, while many other departments like the industries, renewable energy and agriculture have brought in policies.

“The department has to act fast now. They cannot delay things any more. If the department shows dynamism, it can get some Central projects for which applications are pending. As such, Rajasthan is not priority for the BJP-led Central government. That may be the reasons why the proposals for new circuits are still pending. On top of that if the tourism department in the state projects such a poor picture of it, there is hardly any chance to get any Central projects,” said the official.

Now, time has come to bury the turf war, forget the ego clashes and work for the promotion of tourism in the state, he said.

The funds have been received under the Prasad Heritage Circuit scheme, Swadesh Darshan and spiritual tourism scheme to put up light and sound show projects at 10 monuments.

PANAJI: The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ( ABVP ) in Goa on Wednesday said that in view of the recent happenings at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi, it should be ensured that Goa University student elections are kept free from political affiliations.

“It should be seen that Goa University elections are not fought with party affiliations, and that the elections should be open elections,” Prabha Naik said.

The last Goa University student council elections in August saw ABVP at loggerheads with BJP’s student wing, due to which the elections had to be postponed by the university.

ABVP had then said that it was because they were in a winning position that the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha ( BJYM ) employed political pressure and tactics to postpone the election.

BJYM eventually won the polls amidst ABVP claims of political interference.

319,['9/01/2020'],Experts: Growth projections for Amaravati unrealistic,"Illustration used for representational purpose

AMARAVATI: Making it tough to defend the capital city project in Amaravati , expert panels say that none of the top global commerce and trade centres in the world is reporting massive Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) as projected for Amaravati.Singapore, which has become a hot destination for many multinational firms, is reporting 2% CAGR while Dubai is logging 7%. Surprisingly, the planners of Amaravati had projected 16% CAGR in next 20 years.Interestingly, designers of Amaravati (comprising 29 villages) projected that the city would grow to a size of 1.5 crore population in a decade although it has a population of around 1.8 lakh, at present.According to Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report Singapore’s population increased by only 37 lakh in 53 years. Singapore had 19 lakh population in 1965 and it touched 56 lakh by 2019. While population growth rate is 0.69%, its CAGR stood at 2%. This is despite Singapore being considered as a global economic power house.“In this background, assuming to achieve almost 16% CAGA in a nascent city (this is not even a city) is like a wild dream,” said a senior official who monitored the studies of the expert panels for the capital city.He said that many greenfield cities planned in the last 50 years have failed to achieve the goals as the respective governments had failed to pump funds due to poor returns. The financial district project launched in China in 2008 could see a population of 30,000 even after a decade in spite of China’s vigorous attempts to make it a liveable city.The UAE spent close to Rs 30,139 crore to build a new green field city in Masdar to provide basic infrastructure for a population of 10,000. Similarly, it spent nearly Rs 20,000 crore to build another green field city, Neom.“This is why building a green field city has been found very unsuccessful as it requires massive quantum of funds to create infrastructure. The wealthy nations too could not afford the costs of building green field cities,” said a renowned architect associated with the experts panel.Many such new cities have failed to reach the targets due to poor economic activities. Only two new cities-Navi Mumbai (India) and Shenzen (China) were found successful thanks to the overcrowded neighbouring cities (Mumbai) and Hong Kong.The previous TDP government had planned roads and electricity works in Amaravati at a cost of nearly Rs.52,000 crore. Although the government awarded tenders for about Rs 44,000 crore, only works to the tune of nearly Rs 15,000 crore witnessed reasonable progress.While the six-lane highway between Vijayawada-Chennai never witnessed traffic jams, the CRDA initiated eight and 10 lane roads in the nascent city Amaravati.“It clearly shows as to whose sake these works have been planned?

320,['9/01/2020'],Vizag as executive capital may tilt the scales in favour of Bhogapuram airport,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The proposal to set up the executive capital of the state at Vizag has opened up the possibility of the Union government clearing the decks for construction of a greenfield airport at Bhogapuram.

On January 3, responding to a query by Congress MP T Subbarami Reddy on commencement of works at Bhogapuram airport , minister of civil aviation, Hardeep Singh Puri, said, “We are in a position to facilitate this as and when it is ready.”

Officials of the Andhra Pradesh Airports Development Corporation Limited (APADCL) have viewed the minister’s statement as an indication of the viability of the project. “In all probability now, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) will stick to their earlier assurance of closing Visakhapatnam airport for 30 years once Bhogapuram airport becomes operational. The project would otherwise not be viable,” said Virender Singh, managing director and CEO of APADCL to TOI.

Construction of the airport has been mired in controversy since December 2015 when the AAI had given a written assurance to the previous TDP-led government that Visakhapatnam airport would be closed for 30 years once the airport at Bhogapuram became operational. However, after the TDP pulled out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in March 2018, the APADCL anticipated hurdles in the project and in December 2018, former minister of state for civil aviation, Jayant Sinha, ruled out the closure of Visakhapatnam airport, stating that the AAI had already spent crores to develop infrastructure at the airport.

A report carried in TOI on May 17, 2019 stated that the APADCL had proposed compensating AAI for the money spent on developing infrastructure at Visakhapatnam airport. Although the AAI had not responded to the proposal, the APADCL had pegged compensation amount at Rs 40 crore. AAI officials had said there was no reason to shut the airport given the rising number of passengers in the paste few years. The APADCL had already spent Rs 800 crore out of the Rs 24,020 crore meant for the project at the time.

“With the recent statement made by the civil aviation minister, we are hopeful that the decks for Bhogapuram airport will be cleared soon. The airport will be useful if Vizag becomes the executive capital of the state,” said a senior APADCL official to TOI.

Representative image

JAIPUR: The murder of mother-son duo is shrouded in mystery as police have not found any possible suspects but are questioning her husband Rohit Tiwari who has filed an FIR over his wife’s murder and abduction of the toddler.

Tiwari, in his complaint, stated that he had received a message on his phone asking for Rs 30 lakh ransom and Shweta’s number was used to send the message. The mobile is yet to be recovered.

Sources said unidentified accused took out Shweta’s phone’s sim card and put it in another phone to send ransom message. The first message originated from Sanganer area; though officials have not confirmed it.

“The knife looks to be unused and moreover there are high chances that more than one accused was involved in the killings. Even if the husband was involved, he might have hired contractual killers. There are many aspects of the investigation which we are looking at and at this point nothing can be said with certainty,” added police.

“We are questioning Rohit to get more details and as of now not taking cognizance of the ransom demand. The priority is to solve the double murder,” said Rahul Jain, DCP, Jaipur East.

Interestingly, on Tuesday, the canine of the dog squad had stopped close to the spot where the child’s body was discovered and had started barking but cops couldn’t find the body. Cops also questioned people who had visited the family’s residence around the time of murder but claim they are not suspects at present. Many questions remain unanswered in the murder case which has sent shock waves across the city. Besides, cops are still unsure if the knife found at spot was actually the one which used to slit Shweta Tiwari ’s throat on Tuesday. Additionally it was found that Tiwari was at work at the time of the incident.

“The knife looks to be unused and moreover there are high chances that more than one accused was involved in the killings. Even if the husband was involved, he might have hired contractual killers. There are many aspects of the investigation which we are looking at and at this point nothing can be said with certainty”, added a police official on condition of anonymity.

The biggest issue faced by the police in the probe is lack of CCTV camera in the complex’s premises and the official further said, “No one is saying anything and the biggest problem is that there are hardly any CCTV cameras in the complex because of which we are unable to get additional leads.”

The strike was part of a nationwide strike call by All India Bank Employees’ Association

AHMEDABAD: As some 40,000 bank employees from across Gujarat went on a daylong strike on Wednesday, financial transactions to the tune of Rs 12,000 crore came to a grinding halt. Banking services including cash withdrawal and deposits were hit across most public sector bank branches where employees did not turn up for work, except for the State Bank of India group. The strike was part of a nationwide strike call by All India Bank Employees’ Association. Bankers are protesting several issues plaguing the bank employees.

Sharing more details, Janak Rawal, general secretary, Maha Gujarat Bank Employees Association (MGBEA) said, “All bank employees congregated outside the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad and participated in a peaceful protest march till the collector office in Ahmedabad.”

Bank employees from smaller centres including Palanpur, Bhavnagar, Rajkot and Vadodara, among others participated in the strike and held demonstrations at respective centres, said Rawal.

Bank employees are protesting non-revision of their wages. “We have demanded that wilful default be declared as a criminal offence. At the same time, government should initiate efforts to make recruitments in the banking sector,” Rawal further added.Sources said that ATM services were also hit in some places because cash vaults of most banks were shut due to bank closure and thus, money could not be loaded across places.

That apart, other banking services including cheque clearing and instrument issuance were also impacted due to the bank strike . Trade and industry body representatives said that repeated and frequent strikes by bankers are hurting businesses. “Since the bankers had announced a strike in advance, traders could plan their transactions and cheque deposits in advance. However, with daily transactions, cheque clearances, deposits and issuance of letters of credit and issuance getting halted, the business operations are bound to get impacted,” said Jayendra Tanna, president, Gujarat Trader Federation (GTF).

Apart from bank employees, insurance company employees also went on strike.

CHENNAI: More than 45 days since municipal administration minister S P Velumani announced rollback of the property tax hike in urban local bodies, several Chennai residents say the civic body’s online services are still asking for the hiked rates.

A Chennai Corporation official, however, said they had rolled back the rates online too and if there was any ambiguity, residents could petition the revenue department or their respective zonal offices and get it rectified immediately.

The government had announced on November 19 that it had set up a committee to examine representations against the tax hike and that till its report came, in the old rates would prevail.

Some residents’ associations had even written to the Chennai Corporation Commissioner seeking clarity on the status of property tax.

“The inaction on the part of corporation officials causes confusion and many residents are unable or unwilling to make the payment,” said V S Jayaraman of T Nagar Residents welfare association. Jayaraman acknowledged that the property tax rates had been rolled back to 2017-18 rates in some streets.

Jayaraman pointed out that in certain cases, there had been two increases because of change in usage. A resident of Motilal street in T Nagar was surprised to learn that the civic body had hiked property tax for 2017-18 itself due to the status of his property turning ‘tenanted’.

In September 2019, the property owner wrote to the revenue officials seeking clarity and documentary evidence as he had neither let out nor leased the property to anyone. The issue is pending before the Regional Deputy Commissioner, Jayaraman said.

The tax revision came about from July 2018 without any consultation with residents. Residents were also shocked by the quantum of tax hike -- as against the promise of keeping maximum raise at 50 %, residents of some localities complained that the tax went up by 600%. Residents associations in Nanganallur ( Alandur zone), for example, have decided to not pay until the old rates are put up.

Visakhapatnam: The Visakha Rural Police headquarters may be shifted to a rural area from the city if the executive capital proposal becomes a reality.

The police are, however, chalking out their own plans. “If more districts are formed based on parliamentary constituencies, then Visakhapatnam will become three districts--Visakhapatnam, Anakapalli and Araku. If not, the base of rural police would be shifted from the city to a rural area, most probably Narsipatnam ,” sources said.

Visakha rural area, except Vizag city and its outskirts, has 43 police stations, including 14 in Visakha Agency and 11 Maoist-affected mandals.

The police have been on a continuous combing operation with armed reserve and special forces for the last 25 years. “Shifting is not easy. We need a vast area for armed reserve forces and quarters, besides other issues,” a senior police officer said.

Around 3,000 personnel including 1,000 Armed Reserve cops are part of the district police. Of 43 mandals in the district, 37 mandals with 902 gram panchayats come under Visakha rural police district, which has one woman PS, one crime PS, two traffic PS and two marine police stations apart from 43 law and order police stations in four sub-divisions. Of which two subdivisions Chintapalli and Paderu are facing the Naxals problem.

The proposal to shif Visakha Rural administrative wing and armed forces was mooted in 2012 when the police top brass discussed ways to crack down on Maoists.

Rural SP Babujee Attada said he has no communication about the proposal.

PANAJI: Following a mass rally and public meeting that opposed the “anti-people” and “anti-labour” policies of the state and central govenments, the Goa Convention of Workers sent a list of demands to PM Narendra Modi, CM Pramod Sawant and governor Satya Pal Malik. They demanded the resumption of mining through the formation of the Goa Mineral Development Corporation and a retention (monthly) allowance of Rs 20,000 paid to all mining workers till the resumption.

“It will take a long time for the government to resume mining in Goa through auctioning. If they form a corporation, there will not be any legal hurdles. Till mining resumes, all retrenched workers should be compensated with Rs 20,000 per month,” said convenor of the Goa Convention of Workers, Suhaas Naik.

“The policies of the central and state government are against working people,” Naik said. “Instead of real issues like unemployment of workers, farmers’ and students’ issues, irrelevant issues are being debated nationally. There is large scale unemployment in the country. The government must focus on generating employment. There are no industries coming to Goa because there is no infrastructure. The government must look into all this so that many employment-generating industries come to Goa and provide jobs to people.”

The Goa convention of workers is a joint platform of all major trade unions and mass organisations, comprising the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), etc.

A large number of lifeguards made their presence felt at the meeting demanding that the government resolve their issues.

Panaji: Normal life remained unaffected in Goa on Wednesday on the day of a nationwide strike called by 10 central trade unions to protest against the government’s “anti-people” policies. Various labour unions held a massive public meeting under the banner Goa Convention of Workers, but the event failed to pull in private sector employees.

“Nobody was aware of the strike, at least in Verna. Everything was normal. Nobody was on the road so there was no impact here,” president of Goa State Industries Association Damodar Kochkar said.

While attendance at some nationalised banks was low, private sector banks said that there was no impact on their operations.

In Goa, the All India Trade Union Congress, Indian National Trade Union Congress, Goa Bank Employees Association, Centre of Indian Trade Unions, Goa Trade Union Confederation, Goa Bus Owners Association, BSNL Employees Union and several others participated in the strike. The strike in Goa began with a protest meeting and march from the circle near the Kadamba bus terminus at the city entrance and culminated in a massive rally at Azad Maidan in Panaji.

Some private bus operators stayed off the roads in solidarity with the strike call given by the unions, but public transport remained functional and commuters did not face any significant inconvenience in the state.

No violence was reported in the state nor did any of the unions enforce the strike.

334,['9/01/2020'],"ABVP-NSUI clash: Caught on camera, attackers ‘unknown’ in FIR","This story is from January 9, 2020

Now, the case will be probed by city crime branch

AHMEDABAD: Even while videos of the clash on Tuesday afternoon between activists of the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the RSS, and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), the student wing of the Congress, captured many persons, without masks indulging in violence in public, city police have failed to identify anybody yet, and filed an FIR against 25 ‘unknown’ persons from both groups.

While the cops kept saying that a fair probe would be conducted, minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja on Wednesday said the investigation had been handed over to city crime branch.

“Congress leaders have been trying to create law and order problems in Gujarat for long. In Gandhinagar, their workers attacked police (during the LRD protest), a Congress councillor was involved in the violence in Shah-e-Alam and pelted stones at police. Then, their workers armed with weapons had attacked the ABVP office. Now, the case will be probed by city crime branch,” said Jadeja.

City police sources said NSUI leaders injured in the attack and the Congress expressed no faith in Paldi police. “Their argument was that the cops had allegedly witnessed the violence as mute spectators outside the ABVP office in Paldi Gaam on Tuesday morning,” said a senior city police official.

There was high drama at Paldi police station on Tuesday night, as the cops took 17 hours to register the FIR. While DCP Zone 7 K N Damor claimed that two separate FIRs would be registered, police inspector B S Rabari of Paldi police, who had witnessed the violence, became the complainant. He filed a case of rioting and causing injuries with weapons against “25 unknown members each from the ABVP and NSUI”. The FIR was finally filed at 4.30am on Wednesday and did not include any names.

An official of Paldi police said, “NSUI leader and Hardik Patel’s aide Nikhil Savani, who was attacked, insisted on the names of Gujarat BJP secretary Pradipsinh Jadeja and Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) Gujarat president Rutvij Patel be included in the FIR. As Savani could not be convinced to drop these two names, the Paldi PI himself became the complainant and filed a case against unknown persons,” said a police official privy to the developments.

Senior officials said the investigation was transferred to crime branch because Paldi police was engaged in bandobast at various government-sponsored events in the city. “Crime branch will conduct a speedy probe in the case,” said the official.

Before the case was transferred to crime branch, Damor, on why no arrests were made despite exhaustive video footage available, said: “Investigation is on and we will watch the video and ascertain the identity of the accused. All accused will be booked.”

335,['9/01/2020'],"Buses and trucks remain off roads, ministers ride pillion to reach Secretariat","This story is from January 9, 2020

BHUBANESWAR: The central trade unions’ call for a nationwide bandh against the Centre’s ‘anti-people’ policies on Wednesday evoked a mixed response in the state.

While buses and trucks remained off the road on Wednesday morning, the government said the bandh was peaceful.

Commercial establishments, banks, petrol pumps and schools remained shut for the day in Cuttack , Bhubaneswar, Rourkela, Berhampur, Sambalpur and Puri, among other places.

Commuters had a difficult time as the East Coast Railway (ECoR) cancelled three passenger trains (Cuttack-Bhadrak, Bhubaneswar-Berhampur and Paradip-Cuttack), and several other trains were delayed by hours because of ‘rail roko’ agitations in Bhubaneswar, Balasore and Jharsuguda stations.

In Bhubaneswar, big markets like those in Unit I and Unit II wore a deserted look. Shopping malls, too, were closed in the morning and opened only after sundown. Protesters took out marches and motorcycle rallies in the city to enforce the bandh.

Several ministers and officers were seen arriving at their offices on motorcycles. Steel and mines minister Prafulla Mallik and information and public relations minister Raghunandan Das were seen riding pillion on bikes to the secretariat or the Lok Seva Bhawan.

Those who travelled to Bhubaneswar by train and on buses on Wednesday could not proceed further from the railway stations and the Baramunda interstate bus terminal as autos and private city buses did not run. “I was stuck for more than two hours at Baramunda,” said Ritesh Sahu, a pharmacist who reached the state capital from Keonjhar by bus.

The JEE Main examinees reached the examination centres either by riding on bikes, or shelling out exorbitant fares to auto-rickshaws. Some even walked to the exam centres.

Anup Sahoo, Cuttack-Bhubaneswar additional commissioner, said police took more than 500 workers of Congress and the Left parties into preventive custody in Bhubaneswar. Bhubaneswar DCP (traffic) Sagarika Nath said those taking out motorcycle rallies without wearing helmets would face action.

The bandh disrupted coal transportation and production across mines in Talcher. Coal transportation to other states using railway wagons was also disrupted as agitators held rail rokos at Angul and Talcher railway stations.

Mining activities, including the loading and unloading of minerals, in the Joda mining sector also came to a grinding halt. Deputy director of mines (Joda) L D Nayak said, “The daylong bandh caused losses of about Rs 10 to 12 crore.”

Minister of state for home Divya Shankar Mishra, “The bandh was peaceful with no incident of violence reported from anywhere.”

The Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) president, Niranjan Patnaik, termed the bandh a ‘huge success’.

The BJD, however, distanced itself from the bandh. “We are not in favour of disruption of life,” said minister Raghunandan Das. The BJP called the bandh a ‘complete failure’.

Visakhapatnam: Following the recent reports of neglect of the geo-heritage site of Erra Matti Dibbalu (Red Sand Hills) and initiatives taken by heritage lovers to clean up the site partially on Sunday, revenue department officials have prevented plans of illegal construction of cashew farmers, who were about to set up concrete structures at the site near Bheemili.

Heritage activists had noted boulders and stone blocks behind the site around a fortnight ago but were unsure of their purpose. On Tuesday, heritage activist Jayshree Hatangadi observed a lorry loading the blocks while passing by the site.

“On enquiry, a cashew farmer Ramulu told me that they had planned setting up a small house at the site for storage of cashew and other agriculture-related works. However, revenue officials have asked them to remove the stone blocks and warned them against constructions at the site. They are now clearing away the construction materials,” she said.

When contacted, tahsildar-MRO of Bheemili, KV Eshwara Rao, told TOI, “As soon as it came to our notice that a farmer is trying to construct a cement house on the government land at Erra Matti Dibbalu, we told them to clear the building materials immediately. The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms do not permit construction of any permanent structure at the site. Erra Matti Dibbalu is a protected site as declared by the Geological Survey of India. If we find evidence of construction at this site, a criminal case will be booked.”

337,['9/01/2020'],"Nagpur: In New Year, CBSE to focus on competency-based education","This story is from January 9, 2020

NAGPUR: The much-awaited ‘new year’ letter by CBSE chairperson, which lays down guidelines for the year , is focusing on competency-based education (CBE). Anita Karwal wrote to all affiliated schools and said CBE focuses on student’s demonstration of desired learning outcomes as central to the learning process. The other key guidelines laid down by the board is about keeping students fit through physical activities via the ‘Fit India Movement’ campaign.

Karwal mentions that all schools are expected to have well-defined learning outcomes for every grade, which are observable and measurable. She added that schools must help to “empower learners to focus on mastery of valuable skills and knowledge through these learning outcomes, deemed to be essential for success in life”.

Training of principals/teachers will also be pivotal to the board achieving their targets. For this, CBSE from time to time will be providing details about the training schedule and topics.

The board will be moving ahead to strengthen its initiative of ‘Hubs of Learning’ (Hol) to ensure enhancement of quality of education and promote self-improvement. Hol is a cluster of 4-6 neighbourhood schools for their collaborative growth and inspired self-improvement. The main aim of this collaborative partnership between schools is to create an ecosystem wherein the schools, in a hub, learn from each other and partner each other for best practices in various aspects.

Karwal is also trying to put in place a concrete system of self-evaluation to standardize the schooling ecosystem. The process of School Quality Assessment and Assurance (SQAA) involves two essential phases. Phase one is self-assessment, using different instruments of SQAA through an online method, whereas in phase two, the same is validated by the external peer assessor team by visiting the assessee school. The CBSE chief said this assessment should ideally be done once every three years, starting from the current calendar year. Soon, all schools will be provided with an online link for SQAA.

The Fit India Movement, launched by PM Narendra Modi, will now be integrated in schools from November. Every school will be mandated to six working days during the third and fourth week of November to celebrate the Fit India School Week. This would instill in students the understanding for regular physical activity thus enhancing their self-esteem and confidence. Board has tasked the schools for ensuring that all students, parents, staff and management actively participate in the campaign.

Visakhapatnam: The nation-wide bandh call given by central trade unions, including Centre of Indian Trade Unions ( CITU ) and Indian National Trade Union Congress ( INTUC ), against the anti-labour policies of the BJP-led government at the Centre evoked only a partial response in Visakhapatnam district on Wednesday.

Members of various trade unions participated in the protests, ‘rasta rokos’, public meetings and human chain formations and sloganeered against the BJP-led government. Large numbers of police personnel were deployed at major junctions in Vizag city.

Arguments between protestors and the police broke out on National Highway (NH)-16 after a human chain formation brought traffic to a standstill and police were called in.

State-run RTC buses were operational later in the morning and a majority of commercial establishments stayed open. Most educational institutions declared a holiday.

Ahmedabad: Gujarat NSUI general secretary Nikhil Savani, who is a close aide of Congress leader Hardik Patel, and hospitalised for a head injury, had refused to sign a copy of the complaint he gave Paldi police, alleging that they were pressuring him to not name BYJM Gujarat president, Rutvij Patel.

“Police have been pressurizing me to drop the name of Rutvij Patel. Massive police deployment has been made outside VS Hospital, where I have been admitted. If police do not file FIR against the culprits, I will sit on dharna in front of the commissioner’s office,” Savani tweeted on Wednesday. Congress and NSUI leaders alleged that the VS Hospital administration was pressurizing Savani to get discharged from the hospital.

“Savani had named Rutvij Patel and BJP leader Pradipsinh Vaghela, but the police are trying to convince us not to name them in the FIR,” said NSUI general secretary Bhavik Solanki. Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda and party leaders met CP Ashish Bhatia on Tuesday over police’s reluctance to include the names in the FIR.

Representative image

PANAJI: A digital membership drive by Congress which was rolled out in Goa to enrol 2 lakh members by January 15 has struggled to take off, with the party struggling to enrol more than 5,000 till date.

As part of a nationwide membership drive, Congress launched an app-based membership exercise in November, but the drive has been hit by technical issues as well as factionalism within the party.

“Right now, it is a pilot project, and whatever difficulties we are facing, we are sorting out. This is the first time Congress has gone in for digital registration,” said state party president Girish Chodankar.

When asked to elaborate, Chodankar said that practical difficulties in reaching out to supporters, along with poor internet connectivity, has slowed down the membership drive.

“There are practical difficulties where in one family of five people, only one person will have a smartphone and currently we can enrol just one person on one mobile phone,” said Chodankar.

AICC secretary J D Seelam launched the membership drive in Goa with a workshop being conducted to acquaint party functionaries with the app.

To prevent misuse and to ensure genuine members were enrolled, the app requires new members to provide their voter ID number and confirm their enrolment using a one-time password that is sent to the phone number.

“We are going aggressively from next week on,” said Congress spokesperson Urfan Mulla, who has been put in charge of St Cruz constituency. “If you ask me about only minority members, we have registered around 800 individuals in St Cruz.”

Since the membership drive began, Congress has succeeded in registering around 700 enrolment officers, while primary members were registered in Navelim, Cumbarjua and St Andre.

Nashik: The Sarkarwada police on Wednesday detained six students’ activists at the premises of a city-based college for ‘unlawful assembly’ after they tried to persuade the college students to express solidarity with the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and protest against the brutalities by masked goons in the Delhi college.

The detained students belonged to Charta Bharti Vidyarthi Sanghatana and Samyak Vidyarthi Andolan outfits who had appealed to city colleges to observe a bandh to protest against the brutalities against JNU students.

Members of these students’ organisations went to various colleges on Wednesday forenoon raising slogans against the Union government and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). They condemned the incident at JNU and demanded immediate action against those responsible for the violence.

These students’ activists were armed with posters and banners decrying the incident at JNU and were critical of ABVP.

“The students of the country are fearful that similar incidents can take place in any educational institute. We demand that the powers-that-be act tough against those involved in the JNU incident to send right signals to the students’ fraternity of the country,” demanded the agitating students.

During their visit to one of the colleges in the Gangapur Road area, a police team from Sarkarwada asked the students to disperse immediately.

“It was an unlawful assembly of the students as Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) is in place in the city. We had to detain six of these senior functionaries of the two students outfits as they did not heed to our request to disperse,” police officials said, adding that all the detained students were taken to Sarkarwada police station.

Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram in conversation with Sagar Kadiwala, on Wednesday

NAGPUR: In this day and age, it is important to identify talent in the youth, encourage them and provide them opportunities to nurture their skills, said neurologist Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram, in an interview organized by Vidarbha Hindi Sahitya Sammelan at Mor Bhavan, Sitabuldi, on Wednesday.

He was interviewed by littérateur Sagar Khadiwala as part of ‘Samvad’ series which serves as a medium to interact with prominent personalities from various fields.

Meshram said, “Smartphones and TVs inhibit creative aptitude of people. They are silent killers. Advent of this technology is impacting all aspects of our life and there are barely any face-to-face conversations these days.”

Revisiting his childhood, he said, “My father was in health care sphere and he asked me to follow suit. I did my pre-medical studies from Institute of Science and MBBS from Government Medical College.”

“I was advised that lakhs of people have done MBBS, so if I wish to enhance my credibility, I need to attain the highest education in my stream. As I was interested in mathematics, I went for neurology as it requires logical thinking,” he said.

Speaking about the medical field in the periphery of Nagpur, Meshram said, “The dynamics between doctors and their patients and interpersonal relationship between doctors is better in Nagpur than in any other city as there is considerable interaction among everyone. I lived in Mumbai for a while but could not adapt to the fast-paced lifestyle where social life was negligible.”

When Khadiwala enquired about the cure for increasing cases of memory loss in senior citizens, Meshram said, “Research is still on in neurology. Memory loss usually occurs due to old age or deficiency of vitamin B12, generally in vegetarians, which causes dementia. As life expectancy increases, susceptibility to such diseases rises.”

Giving tips for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, he laid emphasis on the importance of regular physical and mental exercise. He said, “Physical activities improve blood circulation in brain. By mental exercise, I mean that one should never retire and sit idle. We must participate in social activities to keep ourselves engaged.”

Being chairman of Orange City Cultural Foundation, Meshram said Orange City International Film Festival is a means to provide a platform to local talent and encourage new artistes.

AHMEDABAD: To provide high-speed internet connectivity to thousands of villagers, the Gujarat government aims to lay 36,000 kilometres of optical fibre across the state by March 2020, in the second phase of the Centre’s ambitious BharatNet initiative. The first phase saw 16,000km of optical fibre laid to provide broadband connectivity to 6,400 gram panchayats.

“An optical fibre network of 36,000km will be laid in Gujarat in the second phase, or ‘BharatNet 2’. Some 20,000km of fibre has been laid. We aim to finish the remaining 16,000km by March 2020,” said Dharmendra Sharma, director, technical and infrastructure (ITS), Gujarat Fibre Grid Network Ltd (GFGNL).

Gujarat government floated the special purpose vehicle (SPV) GFGNL to work with the Centre’s Bharat Broadband Network Ltd (BBNL), which is setting up the optical fibre network under the BharatNet project.

GFGNL has been established under Gujarat’s science and technology department and is creating a backbone network which will help mobile operators, internet service providers and government agencies to deliver multiple services to the doorsteps of villagers.

Of 7,692 villages, optical fibre connectivity has already been provided to 3,651 gram panchayats in the second phase as of December 2019. “The project is at an advanced stage. All 14,000 gram panchayats will be broadband-enabled after the second phase,” Sharma added.

These gram panchayats are to be connected with a 100 Mbps bandwidth which is scalable up to 1 Gbps. “Gujarat is far ahead of other states in implementing this initiative, which will connect villages to the state capital Gandhinagar . People in rural areas will be able to get several e-services from the government,” said the science and technical education secretary, Hareet Shukla.

“School, colleges and hospitals under these panchayats will also benefit. Our plan is to provide services like e-education, e-health, e-agriculture services, e-government and internet to all villagers by 2020,” Sharma added.

ITI Ltd and GTPL Hathaway Ltd and Polycab India Ltd are implementing the project through the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) model. The Centre has sanctioned Rs 1,943 crore for the second phase of BharatNet, while the outlay was Rs 500 to Rs 600 crore for the first phase.

Representative image

PANAJI: Mapusa Urban Co-Operative Bank (MUCB), which has till February 18 to find a way out of its financial woes, appears to have run out of options and time with the only source of hope resting on the state government’s intervention.

The economic slowdown and pressure on the banking system has caused even stable cooperative banks to shy away from a merger with MUCB.

“There is hardly any time for a merger now. The fall of Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank had a very bad impact on cooperative banks and we were really hit badly. Well established banks are worried that if they take over a bank that is under Reserve Bank of India’s sanctions then in the immediate term it will affect their balance sheet,” former chairman of the bank, Ramakant Khalap said.

The RBI, through a directive issued on November 18, extended the financial sanctions imposed on July 24, 2015, till February 18. RBI’s directions had come after MUCB sought additional time to complete a merger process with Thane Janata Sahakari Bank (TJSB). However, a few days after the directive was issued the merger talks were called off after TJSB’s shareholders expressed concerns over the proposed merger.

MUCB needs around Rs 50 crore as share capital infusion in order to come out of RBI’s financial sanctions, but with the government also struggling financially, options remain limited, officials said.

While admitting that the bank appeared to be heading for liquidation, Khalap said he was still holding on to hope. He also said that even if the bank was shut down, the 2 lakh-odd depositors would be able to get all their money back.

“The bank’s total deposits are Rs 350 crore of which Rs 230 crore is in government securities. Besides this, all the accounts are covered by insurance. We have calculated that we will be able to get Rs 170 crore in insurance, which we can pay to our depositors,” Khalap said.

MUCB also has real estate assets with a book value of Rs 90 crore, but the market value of the properties could be higher, Khalap said.

Howrah at 6.33am

KOLKATA: Wednesday’s strike impacted Kolkata partially with stray incidents reported from various pockets. The banking sector was crippled but most offices — including Nabanna and those in Sector V — managed to operate normally. Ninety people were arrested but specific cases were yet to be drawn up. Among those detained, 23 are women.

The first incident was reported from Jadavpur where the bandh enforcers first blocked the Jadavpur railway station after a culmination of a rally led by local CPM MLA Sujan Chakraborty. Two trains got delayed. The bandh supporters then tried to block Jadavpur 8B bus stand. The protesters allegedly set a tyre on fire around 10.30am and reportedly attacked a bus and a police vehicle. Chakraborty denied any arson attempt. RAF was deployed in the area and Chakraborty was detained with 30 others.

Two more skirmishes were reported from Behala and Rashbehari. At Rashbehari, a group of Left and Congress supporters tried to block the crossing. The protesters ransacked a private bus before a police team led by DC (South) Meeraj Khalid intervened and RAF managed to bring the situation under control in 15 minutes.

At Behala, a CPM rally at Sakuntala Park came face to face with Trinamool supporters after they deflated the tyres of multiple government buses. One of it was sent back from Behala Bakultala . A huge contingent of cops escorted the bus till Behala Chowrasta. Trinamool supporters opposed the CPM for trying to “forcefully” implement the bandh and an exchange of words followed before cops intervened.

The flow of traffic was disrupted around 10am on the Central Avenue near Bowbazar where the bandh supporters tried to block the road and allegedly set a tyre on fire. A similar gathering was witnessed at College Street and the pro-bandh rallyists were pushed towards MG Road. A minor scuffle between cops and Left-Congress supporters was reported from Beliaghata as well.

The bandh enforcers and Bidhannagar police got involved in a skirmish at the Karunamoyee bus stand in Salt Lake after the former tried stopping government buses from leaving the terminus. Attempts by bandh supporters — led by CPM leader Koninica Bhattacharya — to try and block ticket counters at Dum Dum railway and Metro stations were quickly foiled by the security posted there.

Back at Jadavpur — and across Rajabazar, Burrabazar and Park Circus — the cops did not intervene immediately as bandh enforcers asked shop owners to down their shutters. But all obliged. “There were several students from SFI who were leading the protests at Jadavpur University gate 4. They did play cricket and chess on the main SC Mullick Road, but we did not let the normal flow of travel get hampered,” said a police source.

The police said they had made heavy arrangements at important crossings like Shyambazar, Ultadanga , Esplanade and Behala. Police have not yet received any specific complaint of arson from the city though “final reports were still being collected”.

Maharashtra has emerged a leading state in organ donation surpassing Tamil Nadu and Telangana in last two years

NAGPUR: Maharashtra has emerged a leading state in organ donation surpassing Tamil Nadu and Telangana in last two years. Policies of the state on organ donation are ideal and the network of zonal transplant coordination centres is very effective, said doctors from Bengaluru-based Narayana Health City.Narayana Health City is a leading network of hospitals having strong presence in south India, which earlier used to be leading in organ donation.“Maharashtra has good coordination between government and non-government sectors which has ensured high number of organ retrievals and transplants from brain-stem dead (BSD) donors. The state also funds many surgeries and transplants under various health schemes to help poor people in need of organ transplant,” said Dr Julius Punnen, senior heart and lung transplant consultant.Nagpur witnessed its first lung retrieval in September 2019. Punnen said rising number of organ retrieval is encouraging, but transportation and transplant services also need to be developed. “Currently, lung transplant in India is at a stage where kidney transplant was 20 years ago. Lungs are complicated organs and transplant needs many technical advancements,” said Punnen.Dr Basha Khan, senior pulmonology and critical care consultant, said less than 100 successful lung transplants have been performed in India till date. “A few doctors in India are trained in lung transplant. We have performed two lung transplants in our hospital so far,” he added.Bone marrow transplant is important for Vidarbha as the region has predominant number of patients who need this.Dr Sunil Bhatt, paediatric hemato-oncologists and an expert in bone marrow transplants, said, “Apart from various cancers, bone marrow transplant is final remedy in thalassaemia and sickle cell. The number of patients living with these diseases is more in Vidarbha, but donors matching them are hardly available. For this, more healthy people from Vidarbha should come forward and register as blood stem cell donors.”Dr Rajiv Ranjan Sinha, an expert in liver transplant, said awareness should be created about living-donor liver transplant in Maharashtra. “In living-donor liver transplant, a portion of the liver of a healthy person is removed and placed into someone whose liver is no longer working properly. It’s safe and can save many lives.”“Liver retrieval and transplant from brain-dead patient has become common in Maharashtra. The next step is to create awareness about live donor liver transplant,” he said.The Bengaluru doctors also conducted an interactive scientific session in association with the Nagpur branch of Indian Medical Association (IMA).",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73169930,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-40295,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/organ-donation-policies-in-maha-ideal-bengaluru-docs/articleshow/73162664.cms

PANCHKULA: Snowfall in Shimla has choked the Chandimandir toll plaza . Since the hill station wore a white mantle, the number of vehicles going towards the capital of Himachal Pradesh has increased on weekdays too, increasing the workload of the staff already struggling to manage the traffic following the implementation of FASTag.On Monday, 38,050 vehicles crossed the plaza. Similarly, on Tuesday, the number was 36,639. On Wednesday till 7 pm, the figure was 30,095 — 14,030 cash users and 16,065 FASTag users. The average count on weekdays is 30,000 vehicles.Staff said there has been a slight improvement in the number of FASTag users but poor pasting of stickers is making it difficult to scan them, leading to delays and chaos. “Vehicle owners are pasting the stickers on the front side of the windscreen. They must paste it inside and in the centre, so that it is easier to scan.”The toll authorities with eight manual FASTag scanning machines are working hard to manage the chaos. The Chandimandir toll plaza has ordered three more machines to manage the traffic. However, there is no relief to commuters using cash lanes. Only one cash lane is permissible.A FASTag operator said, “Some people enter the lane with empty FASTag wallet and start recharging their account online, leading to a long queue”.On the other hand, a security guard managing the traffic complained people have been fighting with them to let them enter the FASTag lane without having the sticker on their vehicle. “It is not possible for us to allow them to enter FASTag lane without the sticker. We have received directions and are just doing our job,” they said.A total of 14 lanes exist on both sides of the toll plaza, seven on each side. According to the new rule, if anyone accidentally enters a FASTag lane or is out of cash in his FASTag wallet, the person has to pay double the normal charge to cross the toll plaza.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73164830,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-428590,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/shimla-snow-makes-toll-plaza-face-the-heat/articleshow/73162671.cms

JigneshMevani

AHMEDABAD: Dalit activist and Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani on Wednesday said that he and other activists will burn copies of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on January 10, when the state government intends to pass a resolution in the assembly in support of CAA .

Announcing his programme protesting the new citizenship law, Mevani said Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani should first provide evidence of his citizenship. “He has come from Burma (Myanmar). First, he should give evidence for himself. Until he shows the evidence for himself, we will not furnish our papers,” Mevani said at a meeting of activists who have decided to protest the new citizenship law.

Mevani said this is their non-cooperation movement against the “black law”. “Many members of de-notified tribes (DNT) don’t have documents. What will they do? This is an effort by the government to divert attention from real issues like unemployment,” Mevani said.

Another activist, Ashok Chaudhary, said, “The gradual curtailment of rights is an insult to the people. How can you ask a tribal person living in this country to prove that they are the citizens of this country? The country’s prestige as being a non-discriminatory state is crumbling.”

DNT activist Daxin Chhara said that DNTs lived in detention centres across the country for five years when the country became independent. The government later did not have any rehabilitation policy for these tribes. “It isn’t possible for DNTs to furnish documents if asked for the National Population Register (NPR) or National Register of Citizens (NRC). We will not give our papers even if we have them,” he said.

JODHPUR: Deadly Chinese manjha has been taking toll on migratory birds in their winter abode in Khinchan in Phalodi . Two Demoiselle Cranes have been killed in the past two weeks and one has been under treatment at the rescue centre.

Following the deaths, the district administration has ordered police to take action against those selling Chinese manjha in the town. The deadly string has emerged as a new threat to the migratory birds in Khinchan injuring them during their flight.

ADM (Phalodi) Hakam Khan on Wednesday visited the habitat of the bird fondly known as “Kurjan” in the Marwar region and apprised himself with the issues related to the bird. A bird lover and expert on the bird Sevaram Mali said that the officer was informed about the emerging threat of the Chinese manjha to the bird. “We told Khan that two birds have been killed and a few are injured because of Chinese manjha in the past two weeks. Understanding this threat, he has given directions to the police to take action against the sellers of the deadly manjha,” said Mali adding that such incidents are reported every year and many die due to this manjha.

Recently about 40 birds had died of food poisoning after consumption of pesticide laced grains and many had got injured which had to be referred to the rescue centre where a team of veterinarians had provided them the medication to save them.

“We had given a representation to the administration last week requesting to undertake necessary works for the safety and conservation of the bird as Khinchan was synonymous with the bird now globally and large number of tourists and bird lovers converge here to watch the bird,” said Mali.

Khan said soon a meeting will be held by the administration with the tourism department, forest department, animal husbandry department and the municipality to address the issues of birds’ conservation and development of the facilities at the rescue centre.

Visakhapatnam: Vizianagaram police on Wednesday arrested two persons for drugging two women and looting their gold ornaments after befriending them.

The accused have been identified as K Lakshmu Naidu of Srikakulam and T Prasad from Payakaraopeta in Visakhapatnam district. Over 300 grams of gold jewellery were recovered from the duo.

Explaining the modus operandi of the duo, Vizianagaram superintendent of police (SP) B Raja Kumari said Naidu and Prasad would befriend passengers, especially women, on buses and trains, and collect their phone numbers. They would then offer female passengers biscuits or chocolates laced with sedatives and loot their gold ornaments.

In some instances, they would call the women and invite them to lunch or dinner, and offer them a sedative-laced soft drink before looting their gold jewellery.

Based on complaints registered by the women, a special team was formed and the duo detained for questioning. Naidu and Prasad confessed that they had looted over 500 gm of gold jewellery.

Police said Lakshmu Naidu is a habitual offender and had also duped several youth to the tune of Rs 70 lakh by assuring them employment in the Indian Army. He has over 13 cases registered against him under various police stations in northern Andhra Pradesh.

Work on the plant had began in 2013 and was expected to be ready by 2015. The plant at Khandepar in Ponda taluka was set up to provide potable water exclusively to Kadamba Plateau in Bainguinim-Old Goa, which at present solely relies on tanker water, and to enhance the water distribution to Panaji city.

Pipelines have been laid from Opa to Panaji, and a 5,000 cubic meter (CuM) master balancing reservoir (MBR) has been constructed at the Curti hillock where the treatment will take place.

The water from the MBR will then be released through gravity.

PWD officials said the entire system, including MBR and the pipeline network, has been disinfected by backwashing and dosing it with chlorine.

Nashik: A 25-year-old woman has been arrested along with her ‘ paramour ’ for the murder of her husband in Takli village of Malegaon taluka in Nashik district on December 28 last year. The duo confessed to the crime, said police.

The woman was arrested from Takli while her paramour from Nashik city on Wednesday, said police.

Inspector K K Patil of the local crime branch, Nashik rural, said the body of a man was found in the bushes along a farm in Takli village on December 29.

The officer said that soon after the victim was identified as Sandeep Khairnar, police started inquiring from the inhabitants of Takli village if he had any dispute with anyone. Police shifted their focus to the victim’s family after the villagers said the man did not have any dispute or enmity with anybody.

“The crime branch then started investigating another angle and found that the victim’s wife hailed from Chikhalohol village and had an affair with the arrested suspect, Vilas Jagtap,” said Patil.

According to the officer, the woman was called to the Malegoan police station and quizzed. She admitted to having an affair with Vilas since her college days. They parted ways after their marriages, but got in touch after the death of Vilas’s wife nine months ago.

“Vilas then started frequenting the woman’s house when her husband used to be on duty at a fuel station. around 8.30 pm on December 28, Khairnar came home and found Vilas with his wife. Soon, a fight broke out and Khairnar and the woman strangulated him with a nylon rope. The same night, Vilas carried the body on his bike and dumped it in the bushes near the farm,” said Patil.

A few hours later, the woman called her father and other relatives and pretended that her husband had not reached home from work.

Police said the woman has two children aged below three years and that they have been handed over to their grandparents.

When I set off from home in Tobin Road for my shop at Chandni on Wednesday, there was no concern over the bandh call. The situation, after all, has changed in the past decade. In the past, travelling to the city centre and opening the shop was not an option. It was a risk to life and property. But bandhs have lost the venom in recent years and do not cast a shadow on life anymore.

Around 9.30am, I hailed an auto and reached Sinthi More in seven minutes. There, I was surpised at the length of the queue. Usually there are eight to nine persons. But on Wednesday, there were around 40. One state bus did come but it was so crowded that boarding it was impossible.

After a 45-minute wait, I got into an auto and reached Shyambazar in 15 minutes. With few buses around, I decided to take the Metro and was at Chandni in 20 minutes. There, I joined some shop-owners who had arrived and waited for the others. This has been the practice in recent years. We wait till everyone has arrived and then open the shops together. If the concesus is on keeping the shutters down, we do so. But that hasn't happened for a while.

Wednesday though seemed different with a group of youths with Congress flags gathering on the street and getting into a scuffle with cops. Soon, there were other youths trickling out of lanes and joining the motley group. This did not bode well. It was defintiely not like the pitched battle one used to witness on bandh days earlier but it wasn't normal either. After an hour of monitoring the situation, we decided not open shops.

The return journey was uneventful but for the long wait for the auto at Shyambazar. All along the way, I kept wondering why we were allowing bandhs to make a comeback. Though other shopkeepers and I had not witnessed picketing, forced road blockades or scenes of violence, the absence of people on the road going about their everyday lives made the difference.

I don't know why people stayed away. For someone who wished to travel, it may have taken a little more time but it was not that difficult. Those who have their own transport, the thin traffic meant travel was a breeze on Wednesday.

Passengers rush to get on to a bus in Ultadanga on Wednesday morning

KOLKATA: There were more state buses on the road than usual on Wednesday but many private transporters chose to play safe, leading to fewer buses and cabs on city roads. Yet those who wished to travel within the city, either to work or to someplace else, did manage to do so with that extra commute time.

State buses hit the road in numbers with drivers in helmets geared for trouble. Though it wasn't like the Opposition-called bandhs during the Left Front regime when near-empty buses plied on the streets, the number of commuters were fewer than a regular weekday.

A state transport department official said it operated 1,150 buses in the city on Wednesday against the usual 900. But with some neighbourhoods like localities on either side of Sarat Bose Road dependant only on private buses that were nearly half the usual numbers, residents had a tough time.

So did those who travel by cabs. App cabs, less in number, were so much in demand that they proved tough to book. A family that arrived at Sealdah station was still waiting for the app cab they had managed to book 40 minutes earlier while another family found it frustrating as no cabs were available on the app for nearly half an hour. However, there were plenty of yellow metered cabs in sight. But none were willing to go on meter and demanded nearly twice the rate.

At the airport, the taxi count was half the number that usually report at the pre-paid counter at Kolkata airport, leading to longer waiting time. Passngers had to wait an additional 20-45 minutes for taxis. Those who availed buses though had no such issue with more number of Volvo buses servicing the routes.

“The situation was alright most of the day barring a period between 11.30am and 1pm when the number of cabs had reduced to single digits,” an airport official said. That shuttles operated in good numbers came as a boon for IT employees travelling to and from Sector V.

(blurb: A total of 31,697 two-wheeler riders were fined for flouting the helmet rule last year while action was taken against 21,392 in the year 2018.)

Nashik: The year 2019 saw 10,000 more bikers without helmet and being fined for flouting the rule as compared to the year before that, despite sustained awareness campaigns by police as well as other stakeholders on the importance of the headgear towards personal safety.

However, the continuous action by police against bikers without helmet is evident from the fact that more than 90% of two-wheeler riders are seen using the headgear in the city.

According to data available with the traffic branch of the city police, 21,392 bikers were fined for not wearing helmet in 2018. However, the number of such violations in 2019 increased to 31,697.

A senior police officer (traffic) said it is easier to spot and fine two-wheeler riders without helmets now because most people have started following the rule. “This is in stark contrast to the scenario in 2018 and the years before that as only one in 10 bikers wore the helmet.”

Police said that their aim is to bring down the rate of fatal accidents on the city’s roads. The maximum number of deaths in road accidents is due to head injuries suffered by bikers in the absence of helmet.

“Taking into account the fatalities due to the violation of the helmet rule, a massive drive was launched throughout the year against two-wheeler riders,” said the officers.

Police officers said the drive against helmet rule violators will continue with the same zeal until 100% bikders follow the rule for their own safety.

PANAJI: A century-old ‘ makar ’ (a wooden swing with a frame), which was earlier used during Makarotsav to display the idol of goddess Mahalasa was recently donated to the Goa State Museum. A family heirloom of Shiroda-based Sudesh Desai, themakar is on display at the Adil Shah Palace in Panaji until January 10.

Usually made from teakwood, a ‘makar’ is styled to have rectangular squares wherein painted glass is mounted on each square on either side of the idol. In recent times, people decorate the squares with coloured paper instead.

“A makar is displayed only in the chowk or the middle of the temple and the idol is placed inside the largest square of the makar,” said Subhash Jan, a Ponda-based professor at Ameya HIgher Secondary School in Curti.

“The deity is decorated with gold ornaments and the makar is decorated with flowers during Makarotsav. The festival is only seen in the temples that have moved out of Antruz (Ponda) due to Portuguese atrocities,” he added.

“The music played during makarotsav has percussion instruments like dhol, tasso and surt besides the tasale (metal instrument) and shehnai (wind instrument). The music played at the festival is very different from other festivals in Goa,” Jan said.

Visual images of the festival –– which showcases various incarnations of goddess Durga and the idol dressed in nine different outfits over the nine days of Navratri –– have been displayed at a temporary exhibition at the Adil Shah Palace as part of the museum week celebrations, this year.

“So far, there is no study done on the Makarotsav festival. The photographs are therefore an effort towards documentation of the festival.” said director of the Goa State Museum, Radha Bhave.

Thiruvananthapuram: Inspired by the huge success of the high-altitude half marathon , organized at Ponmudi last Sunday, ITEN Runners’ Club plans to make it an annual event. As many as 230 runners participated in the second edition of the Golden Peak Half Marathon.

The 21km uphill run, which began from Government Higher Secondary School, Anappara, and concluded at Ponmudi Upper Sanatorium, covered 22 hairpin bends. It ended 3,400 feet above sea level. The race was flagged off by the school PTA president Sivankutty Asari. There were a few participants from the UK, USA, Australia and Poland also.

“Our club has been conducting training in the uphill route in Ponmudi for past many years. Permission was sought from forest department, police and other officials concerned as the area is ecologically fragile. The Golden Peak Half Marathon is challenging because of the terrain. Only those with previous experience of participating in half marathons were allowed to register. This marathon tests the endurance of even seasoned runners,” said Shino Mol Palathanath, organizing committee member.

“A larger crowd could upset the balance of such a pristine and sensitive environment. As the club advocates and practices responsible running, registration was closed after 230 people had registered for the run,” she said.

The club aims to promote marathon as a sport rather than a fitness activity through these events.

The organizers of the marathon collected the waste generated after the event and brought it back to the city for proper disposal.

The competition was held in open, senior, veteran and super veteran categories. Aji P won in the open category (men) and Merina Mathew won in the open category (women). Christopher Roberts from Australia won in the senior category (men) and Rema A K in senior category (women). Pradeep Kumar won in veteran category (men) and Jessy P Jacob won in veteran category (women). Paul PI won in the super veteran category.

SECUNDERABAD: With Secunderabad Cantonment Board ( SCB ) elections round the corner, the number of aspirants hoping to win a seat has grown substantially.With former civilian ward members and their kith and kin already vying for a top spot in the poll race, many new faces have also shown keen interest to fight the election. Several aspirants have started interacting with voters to understand their concerns. Meanwhile, leaders of various political parties have begun to lobby to bag a ticket.“We do not have any political experience to contest the polls . What is needed is a clear understanding of local civic issues and the will to resolve them,” said a youngster who is hoping to enter the poll arena.The Cantonment board election is considered by political parties as prestigious and hence, all parties are busy selecting the most eligible candidate to put forward.For instance, TN Srinivas, who currently serves as chairman of agriculture market committee (AMC), Bowenpally, is a close aide of Secunderabad Cantonment TRS MLA G Sayanna. Srinivas is keen to enter the fray as tenure of an SCB ward member is five years whereas the post of the chairman of AMC lasts only one year. Outlining his plans, he said: “I have decided to contest the SCB elections.

371,['9/01/2020'],Workshop highlights need of milk fortification,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Nashik: Milk manufacturers from across Nashik and neighbouring districts were on Wednesday sensitized about the need for milk fortification during a day-long workshop organised by NGOs Global Alliance Improved Nutrition (GAIN) and Vastsalya.

Milk fortification is a process of adding Vitamin A and D to the milk. The workshop was organised with the support of Food and Drugs Administration, Nashik.

Approximately 50 milk producers from across Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Nandurbar and Ahmednagar district participated in the workshop. The technical experts at the programme acquainted the milk producers with the process of fortification.

Chandrashekhar Salunke, joint director of FDA, said, “The aim of the workshop was to make milk manufacturers aware of the importance of milk fortification. Given the high burden of Vitamin A and D deficiencies among young children and adults, we have to take the lead to spread awareness about milk fortification. The government, too, has included milk fortification in its national programme. Thus, we are encouraging milk producers to take lead in this regard in the interest of the society.”

Salunke said that the milk fortification process at the dairy level would cost just 2 paise per litre.

Kusum from Vatsalya underlined the need and importance of milk fortification. She said that 62% of the population in India has low serum blood levels of vitamin A and about 50% to 94% of people in various states across the country suffered from Vitamin D deficiency.

She also said that micronutrient malnutrition was prevalent in all the age groups, but the consequences were more severe when it affected children below 24 months of age as they are largely irreversible.

Food fortification is extremely helpful in addressing micronutrient deficiencies, Kusum added.

There is a pre-mix available for milk fortification. The fortification has no impact on the shelf life of any kind of milk. Further, the fortification process neither changes the colour nor flavour of the milk, she said.

372,['9/01/2020'],Hi-tech traffic control system gets green signal,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Visakhapatnam: A number of important junctions in the city will soon be equipped with a state-of-the-art vehicle actuated control (VAC) traffic signalling system . The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), after talks with city police, has zeroed in on 50 junctions that will get the new signalling facility.

The system is expected to assist traffic police by measuring traffic density and changing signals accordingly. At present, signals at city junctions work on fixed time (FT) modes in which a signal turns green after a fixed interval and remains green for a predetermined period even in the absence of traffic at the signal.

“VAC is designed in a way such that the CCTV cameras would measure the density of traffic at all points and decide which side is to be given the green signal and which side needs a red signal. It will keep on calculating the traffic density and adjust the timing,” said a senior GVMC official looking after the project.

Police said besides regular traffic, the system will benefit movement of emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire tenders, especially in cases in which an ambulance is held up behind vehicles at a red light, even when there is no traffic on the side that has a green signal.

“However, we will still post traffic cops at these important signals so that they switch to a manual signalling system in case of emergency,” said a senior traffic official.

The system will also be installed at Satyam junction, Thatichetlapalem junction, NAD junction and Hanumanthawaka junction.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has submitted detailed project reports for the two proposed Metrolite corridors — Rithala to Narela (21.7km) and Kirti Nagar to Dwarka ECC (Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre) in Sector 25 (19km) — to Delhi government for approval. After getting a nod from the government and the Centre, DMRC expects to complete the two projects within three years. The Rithala-Narela corridor is expected to come up first.Unlike metro corridors, Metrolite will be a light rail project that will mostly run on road surface. However, unlike similar projects in other cities around the world that share road space with other modes of transport, the Rithala-Narela and Kirti Nagar-Dwarka ECC Metrolite corridors will have dedicated corridors that are fenced on both sides. DMRC has gone for dedicated, fenced corridors as sharing road space with other vehicles would have reduced the train’s average speed considerably.While it was earlier expected that apart from the Rithala-Narela section, two other proposed Phase-IV corridors of Delhi Metro — Lajpat Nagar-Saket G Block (7.9km) and Inderlok-Indraprastha (12.5km) — would also get Metrolite corridors, these have not been found feasible and will have metro services. DMRC found out that on both the Lajpat Nagar-Saket G Block and Inderlok-Indraprastha corridors, Metrolite wouldn’t be able to handle the expected passenger traffic.According to Delhi government officials, the Rithala-Narela Metrolite project will cost Rs 2,914 crore, out of which Delhi Development Authority is expected to provide Rs 200 crore as the corridor will provide some much-needed connectivity to its Narela sub-city. Apart from Narela and different sectors of Rohini, the corridor will also pass through areas like Bawana, Puth Khurd, Sanoth, Bhorgarh and Anaj Mandi. Sources said that unlike metro systems, which are more capital intensive, Metrolite has simpler infrastructure, which brings down the cost. As the corridor will run mostly on roads, the cost that could be incurred for elevated or underground corridors will not be included.The Kirti Nagar-Dwarka ECC Metrolite corridor is not part of DMRC’s Phase-IV project, but a standalone corridor will originate from the Kirti Nagar interchange station, connecting the corridor to the Blue (Dwarka-Noida City Centre) and Green (Inder Lok-Brig Hoshiar Singh) lines. On the other end, the corridor will be connected to the high-speed Airport Express Line , which is being extended from Dwarka Sector 21 to Dwarka ECC in Sector 25. The project cost of the second corridor is Rs 2,673 crore and apart from Kirti Nagar and different sectors of Dwarka, it will pass through areas like Saraswati Garden, Mayapuri, Hari Nagar, Shiv Puri, Dabri, Sitapuri Extension, Mahavir Enclave and Dhool Siras Village.A Metrolite train, which will have three-coach sets and will comfortably accommodate 300 passengers at a time, will be sufficient to handle the passenger traffic on this route. As per DMRC’s DPR, two sets could be joined to make a six-coach train in case of increased demand. The system will draw power from overhead traction.Even though the corridors are yet to receive Delhi government or the Centre’s approval, DMRC has initiated the process of procuring 22 Metrolite coaches for the Kirti Nagar-Dwarka ECC corridor to save time. DMRC will rope in a firm that will design, manufacture, supply, test and commission the Metrolite trains, apart from providing comprehensive maintenance up to 15 years for the standard gauge trains and a train depot.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73164577,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-727195,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-corridors-with-tracks-on-road-three-coach-trains/articleshow/73163655.cms
375,['9/01/2020'],"SC stays HC panchayat order, phase-4 of rural polls may be hit","This story is from January 9, 2020

JAIPUR: The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed Rajasthan High Court ’s order that cancelled the notifications reorganising certain gram panchayats and panchayat samitis after November 15-16. An apex court bench headed by chief Justice S Arvind Bobde has posted the next hearing in the case on February 24.

Following the high court order dated December 13 that nullified panchayat bodies created after November 15-16, the state election commission had announced panchayats polls in four phases beginning January 17. The state government, in the meantime, had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court challenging HC order.

The apex court’s stay order is likely to impact the panchayat elections’ fourth phase, which includes 1,954 gram panchayats and 126 panchayat samitis spread over 26 districts. The panchayat bodies that were created through notifications issued on December 1 and 12 are included in the fourth phase polling as part of rural bodies that existed prior to these notifications.

Legal experts believe that the SC ’s stay order has brought the panchayat bodies created through the notifications of December 1 and 12 back into existence. It was, however, not clear if the state election commission would reschedule the polling for these rural bodies.

The election commission declined to react on the development and said it was awaiting copy of the Supreme Court order.

“The state government did not make the state election commission a party in the SLP. So, we are not privy to the information in the petition and the apex court order. We are waiting for the order copy,” said an official.

Commission officials, though, said that the apex court has not stayed the panchayat elections. “So, the process that has already been set in motion will remain unaffected,” an official said.

The panchayati raj department too was tightlipped about the development.

The high court, while cancelling the notifications, had said, “Since delimitation cannot be an ever-continuing exercise... thus, all the notifications subsequent to the notification dated 15/16.11.2019, pertaining to the issue in question, stand quashed and set aside, except for the notifications which are purely rectifying the typographical errors.”

The high court thus nullified the notification issued by the state government on December 1 and December 12, creating 1,954 gram panchayats and 126 panchayat samitis in 26 districts.

Parents of JEE aspirants outside the Sector V exam centre

KOLKATA: Primary schoolteacher Surojit Chowdhury had thought his daughter Sreeja may miss her JEE (Main) examinations on Wednesday. She didn’t only because Chowdhury’s friend Subir Kumar Raha, a former IAF personnel, offered to take Sreeja and his own son, also a JEE (Main) examinee, to the examination centre. They took a private car from Madhyagram early and paid nearly Rs 1,000 to reach the Sector V centre much before their 12:30pm examination deadline.

Chowdhury, who teaches in a primary school in Kolkata Leather Complex in Bantala, said: “Had it been a normal day, I would have taken a casual leave. Because it was a bandh day, I could not avail any leave. The thought that my daughter may have to sit out for her examination is harrowing. I was lucky that my friend stepped in and volunteered to take my daughter. I reached here after school.” Both Chowdhury and Raha said that they would like to plead to political parties not to call for bandh on exam days.

Baguiati residents Anita and her husband Bikash left home early this morning to reach the examination centre at 7:30am. Their son was to appear for his JEE (Mains) at 9:30 am. “We did not want to take any risk. We hired a private car and left home early. Last night, we were very anxious. It is not fair to trouble children on examination day ,” Anita said.

Presidency University students were scheduled to sit for their semester examinations on Wednesday. The Student’s Union, however, urged the authorities to postpone it to Thursday. Kaushiki Dattachoudhury, a third-year English student, said, “The exam was postponed as most of the university is in solidarity with the campus attack and oppose fee hike and CAA-NRC. They also considered how most students would face problems finding transport. Even as I speak, a picketing is going on outside the gates.”

In Jadavpur University , most of departments did not have any classes as majority of the students decided to boycott classes. Chandreyee Halder, a PG first-year student of the film studies department, said, “I support the bandh. In school, we always had to attend classes even if we supported the strike. I am fortunate I am exercise my rights in my university.”

Police suspect that Ravi himself was going through issues in his relationship.

“It was found that Ravi was in a relationship. But in the recent past, the woman had been avoiding him and he was depressed about this. A few days ago, one of the victim’s friends (who was also his colleague) committed suicide allegedly due to a failed love affair ,” said Marredpally inspector, M Mattaiah.

BJP minister Rajendra Rathore is among the 23 accused named in the FIR

JAIPUR: A lower court here on Wednesday directed Bani Park police to register a fresh FIR in the 2006 Dara Singh fake encounter case following a petition by his son Amit Beniwal charging the accused of criminal conspiracy and forgery.

Metropolitan magistrate court-17 ordered police to file an FIR against the 23 accused under Section 156(3) of the CrPC. Initially, there were 14 accused in the case.

The 23 include former BJP minister Rajendra Rathore, Jat Mahasabha president Rajaram Meel, senior police officers and two brothers of Dara, one of whom is already dead.

Beniwal said his mother Sushila Devi, the original petitioner in the case, was misled and pressurised by the accused in connivance with some influential community leaders resulting the accused in the case going scot-free.

He also accused his uncles — Late Shisharam and Sumer Singh — of acting at the behest of former minister Rathore and obtaining signatures of his mother on blank papers and later misusing it.

Beniwal claimed Rathore paid money to his uncles, but they just helped Dara’s family to construct his incomplete house.

Since the case involved high-profile politicians and police officers, the case was contested with the help of community leaders, he said.

But they also connived with the accused and misled his mother resulting her to turn hostile. Apart from his mother, Dara’s brothers had also turned hostile during the trial resulting all the 14 accused the case, including senior IPS officers, acquitted by the trial court in March 2018.

Bootlegger Dara was allegedly killed in an encounter by the SOG in 2006. Later, the Supreme Court had asked the CBI to investigate the encounter on a petition filed by Dara’s wife Sushila alleging that it was staged.

VASCO: Ruling and opposition councillors of the Mormugao Municipal Council, both backed by BJP legislators, are engaged in a feud over the assigning of labourers to clean wards. While the opposition panel alleged that vice-chairperson Reema Sonurlekar is ignoring their wards, Sonurlekar refuted the allegation saying the trend was set by the opposition itself when it was in power.

“Sonurlekar is acting in a dictatorial manner. She books labourers for a period of 20-25 days but does not assign them to the wards of opposition councillors,” said councillor Muraru Bandekar.

Sonurlekar, however, denied the charge saying that labourers are assigned to all wards irrespective of whether they are that of the ruling or opposition. “Yes we do give priority to wards of ruling councillors, but we have given labourers to all councillors irrespective of whether they belong to the ruling or opposition,” she said.

“Councillors don’t get labourers when asked to clean their wards, but a security guard was given labourers to clean his building in Goa Rehabilitation Board Colony at Sada,” ex-vice chairperson Shashikant Parab alleged.

The vice chairperson went on to allege that the precedent of harassing opposition councillors set by the present opposition during its tenure. .

Bandekar further alleged that Sonurlekar was ill treating the labourers resulting in them going on a strike a couple of days ago. “Even their salaries are not paid on time. We will be complaining about all the to the urban development minister,” he said.

The opposition panel is backed by urban development minister Milind Naik while the ruling is backed by Vasco MLA Carlos Alemida.

The opposition have filed an RTI into the functioning of the council, especially their expenses.

Andhra Pradesh high court (File Photo)

VIJAYAWADA: The government on Wednesday told the high court that the investigation into the murder case of YS Vivekananda Reddy was at an advanced stage and that there was no need for a CBI probe.

Advocate general S Sriram told the high court that the Special Investigation Team ( SIT ) probe was impartial and the team was questioning the persons belonged to all political parties as part of the investigation.

While two petitions moved by chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy and Y S Sowbhagya were in pending with the high court, former minister Adinarayana Reddy and TDP MLC BTech Ravi recently moved the high court seeking CBI probe.

Appearing on behalf of Adinarayana Reddy, senior counsel Vedula Venkata Ramana said that the family members of YS Vivekananda Reddy and the chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy, the then leader of opposition, had made protested against the SIT investigation.

“They had prayed in writ petitions that for instilling public confidence an impartial inquiry is required with an independent agency like CBI or any other agency which is not under the direct control of either the state government or the Director General of Police (DGP). The allegation stands good even today as the present SIT works under the state government and the actions of SIT as said in the petition of Jaganmohan Reddy are arbitrary and ultra vires the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC),” the counsel Ramana said.

The counsel for Sowbhagya, Vivekananda Reddy’s wife, pressed for a CBI probe as there was no development in the SIT investigation. The SIT said it has examined 62 witnesses but do not have a clue about the criminals. He said the second chief of SIT stepping down from the investigation created doubts and so as to inspire confidence, the case may be transferred to an independent agency like CBI, said the counsel for Sowbhagya.

The counsel for BTech Ravi said exempting one Parameswar Reddy from lie detector, polygraph and Narco Analysis tests created doubts about the SIT investigation.

The advocate general argued that the contention of Adinarayana Reddy and BTech Ravi was that they are likely to be implicated in the case. Whereas the contention in the petition moved by the then opposition leader was that the SIT was not questioning the suspects for which he sought CBI probe.

The SIT is questioning every suspect including representatives of all political parties including YSRC, Jana Sena and the family members. The inconvenience of a person who joined the investigation and the political affiliations of that person cannot be a ground for CBI probe, said the AG.

The high court also directed the AG to file counter affidavits on interim applications moved by Sowbhagya by January 19.

The high court directed the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to continue its investigation but not to file the final report before January 20, the next day of hearing of the petitions

Kottayam: Even as the state government and the leaders of various trade unions have assured that the tourism sector won’t be affected by the general strike, a CITU leader sent a letter to a resort in the popular tourist destination in the country Kumarakom, saying that the contract workers of the resort will not report for work on the strike day.

The letter to the general manager of Taj resort and spa was sent by K K Harikuttan, district secretary of Kerala Artisans Union (CITU). In the letter he has informed that workers who are on a Fixed Term Contract belonging to the CITU union will not be present for work on the strike day. The workers include staff belonging to stewarding, laundry, gardening, cutting tender coconut etc. The leader has also sought the cooperation of the resort regarding this. The operation of the resort was badly affected on the day due to the absence of these workers. However, the resort management was not ready to officially comment about it. This move by the trade union comes at a time when the trade unions had exempted the state’s tourism sector from the strike. The Kerala Travel Mart Society had hailed “exemplary” the decision by political parties and trade unions to exempt the state’s tourism sector from Wednesday's strike. The chief minister and the tourism minister had also assured that the sector won’t be affected by the strike. Meanwhile, Harikuttan, the person who had written the letter when contacted said that, the matter in the letter was written by the panchayath committee of the trade union. “It may be related to workers taking part in the strike. The matter in the letter was written by the panchayath committee,” said Harikuttan whose name and official seal appears in the letter. Arunkumar, K, secretary, Chamber of Vembanad Hotels and Resorts, said that apart from the issues faced by one of the resorts in Kumarakom, there was no reports of unpleasant incidents in the region. He also welcomed the move to exempt the tourism sector form the strike. “Destination to destination travel was not at all affected. The tourists were happy. The drivers reported no issues,” he said.

The students said they were protesting peacefully and there was no violence

NEW DELHI: Students came out in strength in Delhi University ’s North Campus on Wednesday, boycotting their classes to protest that the last few months had proved they were no longer safe on campuses .

“The regularity with which students are being attacked bothers me and my family. Who would want to send their children to study in Delhi when this is state of affairs here?” said Dighreandar Singh of the Delhi College of Economics. “Is this what the government should be doing? Shouldn’t it be protecting the institutions and the students? But first they increased the fees, then sent police to beat the students and finally, failed to prevent goons entering the campus.”

There were many who shared Singh’s view. Swati Sharma, who studies in Hindu College, said, “I fear that if JNU, Jamia and Aligarh Muslim University can be attacked, even Delhi University can be targeted? We should not wait for something to happen to DU students for us to react. Unless we raise our voices today, we cannot bring about change. We stand with the students of JNU, Jamia and AMU. They are not alone.”

A student from of Lady Shri Ram College, who requested not to be named, said that being a citizen of India or a student both “leave me feeling unsafe”. Somul Singh of Daulat Ram College emphasised, “We are protesting peacefully, there is no violence here. This is what the democracy teaches us — to voice our opinions. I don’t know what the central government gets out of repressing us.”

Bhavna of Indraprastha University rued the whole controversy over the citizenship laws had been turned into a Hindu vs Muslims issue when “normal educated people like us” have no problems with India’s diversity. “Why the disparity? Why the attacks? We are students. Is this what we take from our growing years?” she asked.

Colleges like Miranda, LSR, St Stephen’s and Delhi School of Economics held independent protests within their premises. Meanwhile, the students’ union of Hindu College requested the students to join the protest at the Arts Faculty while demanding that Mushaira 2020, the annual literary festival, be postponed till further notice.

386,['9/01/2020'],NLSIU draft for gig economy to be ready by February,"This story is from January 9, 2020

View of National Law School of India University (NLSIU) entrance in Bengaluru.

BENGALURU: The National Law School of India University (NLSIU) will submit draft guidelines for the gig economy, the labour market which primarily offers short-term contracts or freelance work as opposed to permanent, long-term jobs, to the government in February.

The BS Yediyurappa-led government may either table a bill in the assembly or frame guidelines under existing laws to protect rights of employees. The draft could be submitted in time for it to be tabled during the budget session of the state legislature next month.

One of the government’s terms of reference to NLSIU is to “protect interests of employees, who work more than eight hours a day”. Employees have also been demanding a minimum wage and basic incentives. “Once the NLSIU prepares the draft, the bill will be debated at an open forum,” said an official of the labour department.

Since 2010, the gig economy in the state has steadily grown, with an increasing number of people subscribing to various application-based platforms for services such as booking cabs, renting houses or getting food delivered to their doorsteps. With more than two lakh people employed as delivery men, cab drivers and executives with Ola, Uber, Swiggy, Zomato etc., the gig economy is a major contributor to the job market in the state.

However, with a spurt in profitability of businesses, concerns have been raised over the possibility of managements “exploiting” employees. Earlier last year, realising the potential of application-based businesses and its employment potential, the government mulled bringing in a law to ensure the welfare of employees. The idea was debated and discussed at an open meeting involving all stakeholders including employees and employers. The NLSIU was roped in and concrete results are likely now.

However, concerns remain whether the law, even if drafted and passed in the legislature, will ever be implemented. With the government extending exemption for IT and ITES firms in the state from labour laws, application-based firms could shield itself from any legislation as IT is at the core of these companies.

“It is true some may try to seek protection under the exemption, but the government is quite firm on bringing them under the ambit of labour laws,” a senior government official said.

An offence in this regard has been registered with the cybercrime police station who said that a 76-year-old man, a resident of Shikhrewadi, Nashik Road, approached them with a complaint stating that his wife was cheated by a conman in an online fraud.

The complainant told police that the fraudster claimed to be an executive of a private pay wallet agency. The suspect sent the link to the woman’s mobile phone and asked her to update her details after clicking on the said link.

He said that his wife got a message on her mobile phone asking her to contact a certain phone number for updating her KYC details in the private pay wallet agency. When she dialled the number, the conman on the other side pretended to be the executive of the company and asked her to open the link he had sent on her mobile phone.

The complainant told police that when his wife clicked on the said link, Rs 48,689 cash was withdrawn from her bank account.

The cybercrime police said that they are investigating the case in details, adding that they have come across similar cases in the past.

Police said that these conmen pretend to be bank representatives and send random messages to people who often fall prey to their tactics.

Visakhapatnam: Commuters in the city have a different kind of complaint these days. Speed breakers placed by traffic police at major junctions in the city a few months ago have drawn the flak of commuters who claim that traffic congestion has increased.

Speed breakers have been placed at junctions such as VIP Road, Beach Road, Siripuram, MVP Colony, Port Stadium, Birla and Satyam junction. Commuters, however, claim that traffic on these stretches has worsened.

Bonica Das, a city-based lecturer said, “Thespeed breakers are increasing traffic at main junctions. There are people who do not slow down at such points and as everyone is in a hurry, they drive recklessly. This is dangerous not only for them but also commuters around them.”

S Srinivas, an entrepreneur, said, “The barricades are punishing the majority of safe drivers because those who drive dangerously swerve through them. With hundreds of traffic cameras in place, it should be quite easy to see that barricades are creating traffic jams instead of allowing for the smooth flow of traffic.”

M Deepak, another entrepreneur, said, “There are major junctions that need engineering solutions. These barricades instead of solving traffic problems create more issues at peak hours.”

G Sambasiva Rao, former president of AP Chambers of Commerce, said, “In an effort to control traffic, line discipline is required for effective management of traffic. We have put forward a representation for expansion of service roads for free flow of traffic. We will be holding a round table meeting with stakeholders from GVMC, VMRDA, AP Chambers of Commerce and the police department to discuss alternate solutions.”

Meanwhile, a senior traffic police official said, “We have received a number of complaints from people regarding the inconvenience caused by speed breakers. This issue will be discussed at the next review meeting,” adding that, “A few months ago, speed breakers and barricades were removed from Maddilapalem automotive junction after a protest was held.”

Jaipur: Police on Wednesday found the body of a 21-month-old boy from a vacant plot near his residential complex in Pratap Nagar, a day after his mother, Shweta Tiwari (35), was found murdered in their apartment. Shweta’s husband, Rohit, is being questioned.

Forensic experts collected samples from the plot after Rohit identified his son Shreyam. Initial investigations suggest the child died of a fatal blow to his head. Shweta, too, was found dead with grave head injuries besides a slit throat. Police suspect she was killed sometime between 2-5pm on Tuesday.

Cops on Tuesday had collected blood samples from two rooms of the 3BHK flat, and recovered the weapons of crime — a pestle and knife — from the apartment. The fingerprints found on them are being examined by forensic experts.

Rohit, a native of Delhi and an Indian Oil Corporation employee, had moved to the city two years ago with Shweta, a native of Kanpur. He was at work when their maid found her body in the living room and informed neighbours, who alerted cops. Shreyam had been missing since then.

On Wednesday afternoon, a police search party ultimately found the child’s body in a vacant plot just over the boundary wall of the residential complex where the family lived.

Sources said the body was dumped there on Tuesday itself.

Shweta’s family reached Jaipur on Wednesday and was preparing to leave with her body for Kanpur when they learnt that Shreyam’s body, too, had been found. They left with the bodies once the postmortems were done. Shweta’s brother, Shubham Mishra, said, “We were preparing to take my sister’s body home when we learnt about my nephew. We were praying that he would be found alive but now are heading home with two bodies.”

“Based on the evidence, we will link the series of events that transpired and arrest the culprit as soon as possible,” said DCP (Jaipur East) Rahul Jain.

NASHIK: The state administration will soon start the loan verification of around 1.40 lakh farmers after they complete the process of linking their Aadhaar to their bank accounts as mandated by the state government for the loan waiver scheme.

About 8,012 farmers are yet to be link Aadhaar to their bank accounts. “There are about 8,012 farmers whose bank accounts are yet to be linked to Aadhaar. We are confident that in next five days this figure will be zero,” city collector Suraj Mandhare said.

According to Mandhare, farmers with loan of up to Rs 2 lakh are eligible for waiver as per the government scheme and, hence, the farmers have to link their bank accounts with their Aadhaar so that the government can know the exact outstanding loan amount of every farmer.

“There is no provision to understand which farmer has taken loan from how many banks. Also, there is a problem in clubbing the outstanding amount if a particular farmer has taken loan from several banks. Therefore, linking the bank accounts – multiple numbers – to Adhaar will help the authorities to understand the exact outstanding loan amount of every farmer,” he said.

Mandhare also said that since only those with loans of up to Rs 2 lakh were eligible for the waiver, there could be chances that a person might have taken loans from two different banks and the quantum could be up to Rs 1.75 lakh each. There could be a possibility that the farmer could get the benefit in both the banks.

“When a farmer links his Aadhaar to his bank account, the administration will be able to know the loan amount of every farmer and ascertain if the farmers fulfilled the condition and, accordingly, extend the loan waiver to him,” Mandhare added.

After all the farmers complete the Aadhaar linking process, the next step would be to find out the outstanding loan amount of each farmer.

“The process of calculating the total outstanding will be carried out by the accounts department. In a couple of days, we will segregate the number of farmers eligible for the loan waiver scheme from those who are not. After validation, the information will be sent to state government for further action,” the collector said.

393,['9/01/2020'],"Sonakshi, Varun Dhawan lend voice to protests against JNU attack","This story is from January 9, 2020

Mumbai: Members of the Hindi film industry increasingly rallied behind the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), taking a cue from actress Deepika Padukone who made a bold presence at the university despite having a new release ‘Chhapaak’ coming up this Friday.

Sonakshi Sinha, Varun Dhawan , Sonam Kapoor , Twinkle Khanna , Suniel Shetty and Nikkhil Advani were among the prominent personalities who backed the cause.

Deepika Padukone had made a bold statement when she visited JNU on Tuesday evening and supported JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh who was injured during Sunday’s violence. This prompted right-wingers to call for the boycott of her film. The move, however, caused them embarrassment on the very first day as several copycat users showing the same film ticket to prove they had variously cancelled their tickets to the film. It even evoked a mocking note from actress Raveena Tandon.

On Wednesday, Sonakshi Sinha voiced anger against the masked assailants of JNU saying, “No matter which political party you support, do you support violence? Don't visuals of bleeding students and teachers shake you up? We can’t sit on the fence any longer. Kudos to Deepika Padukone for showing up, and all those who spoke for speaking up. This is not the time to stay quiet.”

Actor Varun Dhawan, who is touring Madhya Pradesh, called it a “sad and dangerous situation”. He said, “(I) Cannot stay neutral on such issues. It’s dangerous and sad if masked people enter an educational institution and all this happens.”

Director Vikramaditya Motwane tweeted, “Deepika’s stand is going to make a lot of young people question their parents, their peers and their government. Hopefully they'll go out and educate themselves. And not parrot everything authority tells them. She's a true hero.”

Nimrat Kaur made a succinct comment, “Leading from the front, the tallest Deepika Padukone.”

Nikkhil Advani whose pinned tweet is a snapshot of India's Constitution pointed out that Deepika was taking a bigger risk by expressing her solidarity as she is also producer of the film. “As producer today Deepika Padukone would've been standing in the preview theatres in Mumbai waiting to hear praise being showered on her maiden production. She instead chose to stand in solidarity with JNU students knowing fully well the ramifications of her actions. Respect.”

Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap too spoke on the speaking of the significance of Deepika’s visit to JNU. “It sends out a very strong message of not just being in solidarity but of feeling their pain without fear. A lot of people in the film industry don’t do it because it might go against their business but Deepika has managed to negate that fear and give courage to many others who were probably waiting for someone else to take the lead,” he said. Dismissing those who claimed her JNU visit was a publicity stunt, Kashyap said: “It’s an even bigger statement when she does it on the eve of her film’s release. Anybody in the business will tell you it is hara-kiri, especially when you are also the producer of the film. She has a lot more at stake.”

Actress Chitrangda Singh posted a blend of religious symbols including along with a note saying, “This is the country my father fought for. This is the country he raised me to believe in. Students are the backbone of this country. We can't go far by breaking them.”

Earlier, Twinkle Khanna reacted to a news report on the JNU attack saying, “India, where cows seem to receive more protection than students, is also a country that now refuses to be cowed down. You can't oppress people with violence. There will be more protests, more strikes, more people on the street.”

Actor Suniel Shetty condemned the attack in an interview to a film portal. He said, “Absolute disaster. I could be Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian. I can be anybody from BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena, NCP or any other party. But I have no right to go into a temple of education and beat up the kids. You come wearing masks and call yourself men? If you are men why not roam openly? Whichever party has done it, it is not done. At the same time, some students might not be students, they might be protesters, putting up placards like 'Free Kashmir'. Kashmir was, is and will remain ours. I think these things should be very clear.”

394,['9/01/2020'],Delhi may get new police chief by this month-end,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Amulya Patnaik may not be given an extension as Delhi assembly elections get over just a week after his retire... Read More

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police might get a new chief by the end of this month as the Union ministry of home affairs is learnt to have sought the Election Commission’s nod to replace the incumbent commissioner , Amulya Patnaik .

A ministry official said that Patnaik might not be given an extension as Delhi assembly elections get over just a week after his retirement, which is January 31. “A call has not been taken yet, but if an extension was on the cards it would have been announced by now,” he added.

Also, Patnaik has completed three years in the post and the Election Commission may not want to bend the rules regarding the reshuffle of officers.

With this development, speculations are rife about the new police chief. Sources pointed out that given the recent gaffes involving Delhi Police, the government is likely to keep in mind two aspects while considering an officer’s candidature — expertise in maintaining law and order and experience in running a metro city.

While a few officers in the UT cadre are in the race, officials said there are chances that the government might opt for an “outsider” for the post and “spring a surprise” as they did in the appointment of the CBI director last year. Interestingly, Delhi has always had a top cop from the UT cadre. In the last two decades, UP-cadre officer Ajay Raj Sharma was the last one to be placed in the chair in 1999.

Sources said there are three frontrunners from outside the UT cadre— 1985-batch officer Subodh Jaiswal (Mahrashtra cadre), SM Sahay (J&K cadre) and AK Sharma (Gujarat cadre) of the 1987 batch.

Jaiswal and Sahay are being considered on the basis of their experience in dealing with terrorism and intelligence. Jaiswal was earlier Mumbai Police commissioner and is currently serving as DGP of Maharashtra. Sharma was serving in CBI and is currently in CRPF.

Among the frontrunners are 1987-batch officer Mohammed Taj Hasan, SBK Singh (1988), Balaji Shrivastav (1988) and Sandeep Goyal from the 1989 batch. 1984-batch IPS officer Rakesh Asthana and 1985-batch officers Ajay Kashyap, Prabhat Singh and SN Shrivastava are also in the race. The names of three or more officers is likely to be sent to UPSC and the government for appointment by next week.

A gardener tends to rose bushes at AHSI

KOLKATA: A rose by any other name would not be Monica Bellucci .

Dedicated to the popular Italian actress, who starred in Hollywood films like, ‘The Matrix Reloaded’, ‘The Passion of the Christ’ and Bond film ‘Spectre’, the carmine-pink rose will be among the 60-odd varieties that will be showcased at the Agri-Horticultural Society of India (AHSI) during its bi-centenary celebrations from January 9 to 12. AHSI will also host the World Regional Rose Convention (WRRC), a prestigious event that celebrates the flower found universally that symbolizes love, passion, joy, humility, appreciation, admiration and enchantment.

“Rose is the only flower that connects the entire world. When someone gives a rose anywhere in the world, it symbolizes friendship and love. There is no other flower that connects the world the way the rose does. There are 40,000 rose varieties across the globe, of which around 3,000 are found in India. AHSI has 75 varieties. Around 60 varieties with different colour combinations will be showcased at the show,” said AHSI president Sunil Kanoria.

Apart from the Monica Bellucci Rose, created by Meiland Richardier, the rare varieties of roses on display will include Over the Moon, a hybrid tea rose cultivar, bred by Pierre Orard in France, and Joy of Life, bred by Hans Jürgen Evers of Germany. The Bengal rose, blood red in colour, is distinct from other Indian varieties.

Celebrated Thai floral artist Phubast Chesdmethee, popularly called Poo, will create an installation for the show and curate a floral fashion show. Around 300 delegates from all over the world, including members of the World Rose Society, headquartered in Brussels, will discuss the technology development, research and markets and share their perspective on roses. The show will also present perennial flowers, medicinal plants, a wide range of foliage plants, cacti, succulents and bonsai grown in pots.

While the past 200 years had been eventful, Kanoria said AHSI was keen to focus on reviving the R&D centre and partner universities and corporate groups to improve its utilization. AHSI, founded by William Carey, played a key role in introduction of tea bushes to Assam and a wide variety of vegetables and fruits in pre-Independence India, like cauliflower , cabbage, tomato and beet.

In the run-up to the bi-centenary year, the AHSI garden has been revamped and nearly 50,000 plants have been added in last six-seven months.

399,['9/01/2020'],Nashik: District administratio to set up village-level weather stations,"This story is from January 9, 2020

The district currently has 92 weather stations at circle offices.

NASHIK: The district administration is considering setting up of weather stations at village level to get exact climatic data for bringing in transparency in providing aid to the farmers in times of inclement weather and other issues.

The district currently has 92 weather stations located at the Circle office – which is a group of several villages. The weather readings – especially the rainfall, are taken by the Circle officer who then reports the same to the tahsildar office, where the data is collected and recorded for further use.

“At this point in time there is a huge disparity of rains and one may find that there is heavy rain on one side of the road and the other side is dry. As far as Circle office jurisdiction is concerned, in the rural areas, the area covered is more than 16 sq km or even more. There are chances that a village in the Circle does not receive rain at all while the neighbouring villages are flooded with water,” a senior officer from the district disaster management pointed out.

At times of deciding heavy rain, average rain, etc and when there is a situation of loss of crop due to heavy rain or even because of drought or water scarcity, the rain gauge reading plays a vital role. “Given the above situation, it is impossible to get better weather records. Opening up of more weather stations can help the administration get the micro-level information,” the officer said.

In order to reach out to the last-man enabling justice, the district administration has asked the official bodies and departmental officers to put a request for the installation of weather stations. “The gram panchayat, the panchayat samiti, the talathi office or even others can present their demands for setting up of the weather stations, which will be monitored by the officers from the corresponding bodies/govt agencies,” the officer said.

The officer further pointed out that the funds for buying and installation of the weather stations would be taken up from the district innovation funds. “There is a provision in for spending of district funds for such works under the head of district innovation funds. The funds from the district planning committee will be used for setting up,” the officer said.

Considering the number of requests the administration will choose whether to go for manual weather station or the automated weather station. “In the district, the administration has put up manual weather stations and it could think of installing the automated weather stations to cut down the human intervention and timely updating of the weather notes,” the officer said.

Guntur: Scores of employees from Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (SPDCL) participated in mass hunger strike against the Centre’s plans to make amendments to the energy Act , 2003, here on Wednesday. Senior officials also extended their support to the agitation by visiting the hunger strike camp. Employees from different wings in SPDCL attended the strike held at the Vidyuth Bhavan in the city.

Addressing the gathering, Andhra Pradesh Electricity Employees Association (APEEA-1104) state general secretary M Veeranjaneyulu said that they would not hesitate to intensify the agitation if the Centre did not relent on the issue. “The proposed amendments to the energy Act, 2003 are going to hit the consumers as well as employees. People should also hit the streets opposing the amendments,” said Veeranjaneyulu. He said that it would be very difficult for the state governments to implement the subsidies being offered. He also alleged that the new amendments would help the private corporate sector.

State union deputy secretary AVSS Prasad said that entire energy sector would collapse if the new bill was cleared by the parliament. He said that agriculture sector would be biggest victim with the amendments as several state governments were giving free power to farmers.

Prasad said that no private firm had successfully managed either an energy plant or the distribution system in the country due to the strong presence of PSUs. He alleged that private firms were conspiring to weaken PSUs and loot public money.

Employees held a massive human chain on Guntur-Bapatla road demanding the immediate withdrawal of amendments.

Panaji: The Corporation of the City of Panaji ( CCP ) has seized 14 food carts operating near Don Bosco school in Panaji after they were found dumping waste in the drains.

“We will have a meeting and decide what action can be taken against them. We will either impose a penalty or cancel their license,” CCP mayor Uday Madkaikar said.

The CCP raided the place after they received multiple complaints from residents in the vicinity as well as from Don Bosco school of stench emanating from the area.

“A team was sent and they found the drains filled up with chicken bones and food waste with a rotten smell,” Madkaikar said, adding that the vendors were recently warned and their operations stopped for four days after complaints were received.

“We have been collecting their waste regularly. They are unfortunately repeating this behaviour. People’s health is at stake. (Panaji MLA) Atanasio Monserrate permitted them to operate on humanitarian grounds, but they cannot carry out their business by inconveniencing others. The place was very dirty and full of mosquitoes.” the Panaji mayor said that the CCP’s town vending committee will meet to identify alternate places where the food carts can be shifted.

He also attributed flooding in the area to the food cart operators, who clog up the drains with garbage. “We told them we would provide them with garbage collection and water, but it is their responsibility to keep the place clean,” Madkaikar told reporters.

Of the 92 food carts in the city, 17 operate near Don Bosco school, all of which were seized, however, three selling only cold drinks have been permitted to continue operations.

NEW DELHI: Denying that the Jawaharlal Nehru University administration had made any suggestion to “shut it down”, officials of the Union human resource development ministry said that the unrest over hiked hostel fees had been prolonged by a leftist student group’s refusal to accept a compromise formula suggested by the ministry as well as vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar ’s reluctance to open a dialogue or show leniency to student protesters. At a meeting on Wednesday, the ministry asked Kumar to restore normalcy on the campus at the earliest and advised him to be more communicative with students and take the faculty into confidence while making decisions.Asked if JNU , in its report to the HRD ministry on Monday, had suggested shutting down the university temporarily, Kumar asserted, “We made no such suggestions.” He was accompanied by Professor Satish Chandra Garkoti, Rector-II, at the meeting, the first time after the stalemate since October 28 last year over the sharp increase in hostel fees that the VC was meeting MHRD officials.Amit Khare, secretary, HRD ministry, disclosed that JNU officials gave a factual report of what happened on the campus on Sunday. “The VC also informed us that the administration was making all efforts to restore normalcy and had appealed to all the stakeholders to maintain peace and not get provoked by misinformation,” said Khare.According to an HRD ministry official, “The VC needs to be more communicative. He briefed the ministry on the events of January 5 and said that he has done everything as per the statutes. However, the ministry feels he should be more open and available. There has been a complete communication breakdown. He may have difficulties speaking to the students at this juncture, but he should at least meet the faculty and take them into confidence.”According to a ministry insider, the faceoff could have ended nearly a month ago had the VC and one leftist student group not remained adamant and non-negotiable in their stances. “During the meetings with the students, a section of the representatives agreed to the suggested measures of the HRD ministry, which included the University Grants Commission bearing the newly levied utility and services charges in hostel fees, notifying JNUSU and taking a lenient view against the protesting students,” another HRD ministry official said. “However, the university administration showed reluctance to implement the suggested measures. So the students intensified their agitation for a complete rollback of the hike and then blocked the registration process.”The VC, who has been severely criticised by students and faculty members for not taking immediate measures when a mob attack began on the campus last Sunday, told the ministry officials that efforts were being made to facilitate semester registration for “willing” students. However, an official said the ministry was of the view that the university should not pressure students to register within a fixed period. “If there is no last date for registering, the tension is automatically reduced,” the official reasoned.On confusion over payment of hostel fees during the registration process, the ministry has asked Kumar to clarify that only Rs 300 would be charged. “They are students and we are here to provide them education, not deprive them of it. The ministry will ensure funds if there is record of discussion on this,” the official added.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73164466,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-242185,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-suggestion-to-shut-jnu-down-mhrd-asks-vc-to-open-dialogue/articleshow/73163710.cms

A detailed alignment drawing of the proposed flyover will be prepared and an environment impact assessment test will be conducted,” said a KMDA official.In 2013, a flyover was conceptualised to connect Bypass with New Town—crossing over a portion of the East Kolkata Wetlands—with an aim to decongest the busy Chingrighata crossing and Salt Lake Bypass. The government revived the project but environmentalists raised objections, saying the construction would lead to irreversible damage to the wetlands. The Calcutta High Court issued an injunction on the project, saying the clearance would have to come from the Centre. Following the injunction, a Centre-appointed committee visited the site earlier last year and suggested that the authorities should alter the alignment. Accordingly, KMDA engineers a couple of months ago revised their plan and came up with the Salt Lake Bypass alignment.KMDA officials can start constructions only after completing several steps, such as getting the plan approved, preparing a detailed project report, obtaining environment clearance and receiving administrative as well as financial sanctions from the state cabinet. The authorities said that before the work on the ground began, they would have to think about what to do with the existing 400m-long one-way flyover at the Chingrighata crossing. A structural health study has revealed that flyover has turned weak but long-term repairs were not an option. Officials said they would keep strengthening the structure and allow light vehicles only till the new flyover was ready and this could be dismantled.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73164920,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-117534,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rvnl-gives-nod-to-kmda-to-build-chingrighata-new-town-flyover/articleshow/73163671.cms
406,['9/01/2020'],Eastern Railway brings hi-tech solution for safety,"A Duronto Express train (File photo)

KOLKATA: Three automated devices developed by the Asansol Division of Eastern Railway (ER) will ensure safety for trains running between eastern and northern India, including important ones like the Rajdhanis and Durontos. In addition to safety, the devices will also ensure improved punctuality of these train services.The technicians who are involved in developing the devices have focussed on three basic areas where things can go wrong, leading to disasters.“The first of these devices is a level-crossing gateman alert system. Gatemen are supposed to keep vigil throughout the day and night to ensure that tracks are free from infringement by road vehicles when trains pass. However, gatemen sometimes fall asleep, particularly at night in remote locations. That is why, the device generates an alarm at the intervals of every 30 minutes to alert them. If a gateman fails to acknowledge, the device automatically alerts the sectional supervisor or permanent way official-in-charge. The officials can also use this device to communicate with the gateman, when needed,” said Nikhil Kumar Chakraborty, CPRO, ER. The device costs about Rs 45,000.Sometimes there are delays in closing level-crossing gates by the gatemen due to miscommunication. At times, station masters or assistant station masters forget to alert the gatemen at interlocked level-crossing gates of approaching trains.Till now, station masters communicate with them through magneto telephones where the conversation is not recorded. The ASM-LC communication system developed recently uses GPRS technology while the alerts are sent by the press of a button. The gatemen receive both visual and audio alerts and have to respond in time. Both the times of informing and response are recorded and stored in a cloud for verification later, if required. Each unit costs about Rs 78,000.“Till now, it was the station master’s word against the gateman’s. In the end, passengers suffered. Under the new system, the alarm at the gateman’s end will only stop after he acknowledges the instruction. If there is a delay in response, he can be hauled up,” said Chakraborty. Oversized vehicles passing through a level-crossing gate can also cause severe problems.At times, their tops get entangled in overhead equipment, resulting in major snags that last for long. Trains forced to make unscheduled stops for such reasons are prone to accidents. Though there are height barriers at either end of level-crossings, oversized vehicles sometimes knock them down, causing more trouble for trains. The new system detects oversized vehicles from a distance and emits a warning, both audio and visual till it stops. It costs Rs 98,000 to build the device.“The devices are now being tried out at specific locations and will be distributed to all stations and gates after more are manufactured,” said the CPRO.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73167810,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-252523,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/er-brings-hi-tech-solution-for-safety/articleshow/73163701.cms

Vijayawada: The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) has requested citizens to participate in Swachh initiatives to help the city achieve the best rank in Swachh Survekshan 2020. The civic body launched the campaign ‘I Support Vijayawada’ to educate people about the importance of feedback in achieving top rank in Swachh Survekshan.

Vijayawada, which emerged as India’s cleanest big city in 2018 had a bitter experience the following year. Vijayawada, which secured the fifth rank in 2018 slipped to 12th position in 2019. VMC authorities identified poor feedback and lack of involvement of the public in Swachh initiatives as the main reasons for the poor performance.

Civic officials have turned their focus to rectifying the mistakes made in 2019. This year VMC has established selfie points at multiple locations to motivate students to post their Swachh activities on social media and tag the civic body.

“We are doing our best to achieve the top rank this year. The first two-quarters of survey is over and we have entered the third quarter. Feedback of citizens is important at this stage and we request them to answer calls from Swachh Survekshan survey and give positive feedback. Smartphone users are requested to give feedback in Swachh Survekshan - 2020 website,” said VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh.

He added that health and sanitation wings will hold awareness camps at parks, residential colonies, apartments, colleges, schools.

Meanwhile, with Swachh Survekshan inspection teams expected to visit the city soon, the civic body has its intensified special drive to control open urination Swachh Grahis (volunteers) have been deployed at problem areas to control open urination.

Nashik: District collector Suraj Mandhare has decided to implement the district Disaster Management Act in Trimbakeshwar to ensure disaster-free conduct of Nivruttinath Maharaj Yatra scheduled on January 20.

The pilgrim town has a population of only 13,000 people and every year during the yatra between January 19 to 21, close to 2 lakh people visit the place. In order to ensure the safe conduct of the fair, the administration has clamped the district Disaster Management Act for the area with two incident commanders – the local police inspector PS Karpe and the chief officer of Trimbak Municipal Council Pravin Nikam.

“In order to ensure there is a safe passage of the event when huge numbers of pilgrims are going to come to Trimbak, we have clamped the disaster management act and given all the authorities of ensuring the safety and security of the pilgrims and even eviction of the encroachments without any liberty and other thoughts to the local officials,” said collector Suraj Mandhare.

Across three days around 5 lakh, people will be there at a given moment and there will be a floating population of another lakh in the small town as a result of which food, health, and sanitation measures are required to be raised for the people coming here. The people coming here would put a strain on narrow streets, the infrastructure of the town, provision of cooking foods and many things that could affect the pilgrims as well as the locals.

Karpe and Pravin would be responsible for making arrangements for the smooth passage of the people. “They will take measures to avoid a stampede, ensure all civic supplies run normal, health and medical services are available to each and everybody, in any case, availability of fire-fighting and rescue services, removal of any kind of impediments in and around the temples that could create problems for the people,” the officer said.

All the people who fail to adhere to orders of these authorities and create problems for the administration will be booked under section 51 of the Disaster Management Act for obstructing the officer in discharging his duties under the Act.

Thirty stalls have been put up on SSKM campus for the four-day Kolkata Mental Health Fair starting from today

KOLKATA: A first-year computer engineering student of Jadavpur University committed suicide by jumping off the eight floor of the nine-storied building in the campus on December 19. This is one of the numerous instances where a youngster took such extreme step, despite having the possibility of a bright future.

“According to studies, 90% of the suicide cases are related to depression. In majority of the suicide cases, the victims are aged between 19 and 29 years. Depression is a silent killer. We need to talk about depression and other mental illness more often, so that the stigma attached with the ailment can be driven away. Those suffering from the illness can seek professional help before it is too late,” said Pradeep Saha, director Institute of Psychiatry (IOP) at IPGMER , SSKM Hospital.

While one in 7 men suffers from depression, the concurrent figure for women is one in 5. Mental health experts said that in addition to depression, 10% of the people battling with schizophrenia have the tendency to commit suicide.

According to 2018 National Crime Record Bureau data, West Bengal is among the five states with high number of suicides, the figure crossing 10,000 in West Bengal where 13,255 cases of suicide were recorded in 2018.

In an attempt to create awareness on mental health conditions and the treatment available, IOP in association with Kolkata Psychiatric Association is organising a four-day Kolkata Mental Health Fair in the hospital campus at IPGMER from Thursday.

“Though alarming, awareness and understanding of mental health is very poor and this leads to such ailment being not diagnosed or not reported. Mental health disorders are like any other ailments that can be treated,” added Saha who is also the organising secretary of the event.

Apart from doctors from the country, faculties from aboard, which include Mohan Isaac from the University of Western Australia and JS Bamrah from University of Manchester, will deliberate on different issues of mental health.

A theme song on the need to talk about mental health will be played in the background. Hundreds of people are likely to visit the 30 stalls that will be put up in the hospital. These stalls will render different services, including doctors attending patients, NGO workers helping people with substance addiction and legal aid services. Some patients who have recovered from their mental illness will talk to people, advising them not to shy away from seeking treatment for mental ailment.

Tirupati: Lord Venkateswara’s jewellery, which was reported missing from the well-guarded treasury situated in the administrative building of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams in 2017 and which was exposed two years later in August 2019, has been declared ‘lost’ after the temple administration completed the process of reverification of the full inventory stock at its treasury.

It may be recalled that after the sensational expose in August last year, TTD EO Anil Kumar Singhal confirmed to the media that two gold rings, two necklaces worth Rs 4.2 lakh, one gold coin worth Rs 71,000, one silver crown weighing 5.4kg and worth approximately Rs 2.3 lakh, silver-coated copper coins and aluminium coins worth approximately Rs 14,500 were reported short during stock verification at TTD’s treasury. Though the jewellery was reported to have gone missing from the TTD treasury in 2017, the incident came to light only in 2019.

Following the development, Singhal had announced that TTD would carry out the exercise of reverification of all jewellery stocks at its treasury besides initiating recovery proceedings against assistant executive officer M Srinivasulu, the then in-charge of the treasury from where the jewellery went missing, to recover the value of the jewellery from his monthly salary.

After four months of reverification, TTD officials submitted their report to the EO, in which they stated that all articles, including the 5.4kg silver crown, are still missing. The temple administration may now initiate disciplinary proceedings against Srinivasulu.

Dhule MP Subhash Bhamre (black jacket) celebrates with his supporters in Dhule on Wednesday.

NASHIK: North Maharashtra emerged as the sole consolation for the BJP in the zilla parishad elections, the results of which were declared on Wednesday. The BJP won the election in Dhule and has staked claim in Nandurbar but lost ground in its stronghold of Nagpur.

The party’s dominance in North Maharashtra came to fore with its emphatic win in Dhule, where BJP had won 39 out of 56 seats. The Congress-NCP and Shiv Sena had a pre-poll alliance in the polls. While Congress won seven seats, Sena three and NCP won four seats.

It is for the first time that BJP will come to power in the Dhule ZP . “The win is stupendous for us. We were expecting to win around 34 seats. The results have proved that BJP has cemented its base in Dhule, after the municipal corporation election last year. The results would be an eye opener for our opponents,” said Anup Agarwal, district BJP president.

In Nandurbar, a traditional bastion of the Congress, BJP has trumped up a spectacular performance, winning 23 seats. In the previous election, BJP had won only one seat. BJP insiders credited former minister and BJP MLA from Nandurbar Vijay Gavit for the party’s performance in the ZP polls. Four members from Gavit’s family — his wife Kumudini Gavit, brother Prakash Gavit and his wife Vijaya Prakash Gavit and niece Archana Sharad Gavit have been elected.

Similarly, Bharat Gavit, son of nine-time Congress MP Manikrao Gavit, and his wife Sangeeta Bharat Gavit were elected from the BJP camp.

This time, the Congress has also won 23 seats, Shiv Sena seven and NCP three. The Sharad Pawar-led NCP has reported a drastic fall of 22 seats compared to the previous polls.

A major loss for Congress in Nandurbar was the defeat of Hemlata Padvi, wife of state tribal welfare minister K C Padvi. Hemlata, contesting from Toranmaal, was defeated by the Shiv Sena candidate.

In contrast, Ajit and Madhukar, sons of former minister Surupsinh Naik, were elected from the Congress ticket.

Here, however, the Congress, Sena and NCP did not enter into a pre-poll alliance. The NCP and the BJP tied up in the fight in Navapur taluka, where they contested five seats each.

BJP Nandurbar district units president Vijay Chaudhary claimed that the success of the party in rural areas was astounding. “With this, the BJP has proven the fact that it is gaining popularity in the rural areas too. The BJP was in alliance with the NCP and hence its strength is 26,” he claimed.

HC contempt proceedings had been filed against Patanjali Bhartiya Ayurvigyan Evam Anusandhan Sansthan

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday ordered yoga guru Ramdev ’s institute, Patanjali Bhartiya Ayurvigyan Evam Anusandhan Sansthan — which offers courses in Ayurveda — to refund to its students the extra fee charged by it.

The single judge bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari gave the institute eight weeks’ time to refund the extra money that the institute had charged from students of Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medical Sciences (BAMS) after a Government Order (GO) had increased the fee from Rs 80,000 to Rs 2.15 lakh. The GO had later been quashed by the HC.

Speaking to TOI, Vinod Tiwari, the lawyer appearing for the petitioners in the case, said, “The lawyer appearing for Patanjali has given an undertaking to the court that the fee will be refunded.”

The court’s order came while hearing a contempt petition filed by a student of Patanjali Bhartiya Ayurvigyan Evam Anusandhan Sansthan named Subham Pant who along with 23 other students alleged that despite the high court order quashing the GO of October 2015 that had increased the fee for the Ayurvedic colleges, the institute was neither returning their money nor were they collecting the fee according to the new HC order.

The October 2015 GO was quashed by the high court in July 2018 which held that the fee can be increased only by the fee regulation committee and that the increased fee should be returned to the students. The institute had approached the high court again in November 2018 and the court again said that the students’ fee should be returned.

The petitioner Subham Pant said that the students are now hopeful of action being taken by the institute. “Now that the court order has come, we are finally hopeful that our money will be returned,” he said.

SK Tijarawala, spokesman for Patanjali, meanwhile told TOI, “We are yet to receive a copy of the high court order. However, whatever the order is, we will study it and follow the directions accordingly.”

The government also plans to develop a 23-acre theme park depicting the life and achievements of the feudal chieftain, which will give fliers a “glimpse” into the life of the city’s founder. “We discussed the design and concept of the statue and the park with experts in detail at the meeting,” Narayan said.

He said members also decided to protect and rejuvenate 46 places developed by Kempegowda in and around Bengaluru. “An action plan has already been prepared and it will be made public after a final decision at the government level,” the DyCM added.

Chief minister BS Yediyurappa had announced the grandiose plan in September last year in a bid to placate the Vokkaliga community which was said to be “miffed” with the BJP for dislodging the coalition government led by HD Kumaraswamy and for the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filing money laundering cases against DK Shivakumar.

The government also decided to build a film city of global standards in Bengaluru. “We have identified the site for the film city and it will be made public after a discussion with the CM,” Narayan said.

Narayan said the government intends to build a film city that is a cut above others in the world. “It will have all the facilities required to produce a film including an animation centre,” Narayan said.

Asked why the film city is not being built either at Mysuru or Ramanagara — as announced by the two previous governments led by HD Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah — Narayan said Bengaluru is “known for its talent in animation films”. “Animation works of films like Avatar and Lion King were done in Bengaluru. Keeping this in mind, we decided to build the film city in Bengaluru,” he said.

He said the government will also build an arts and crafts village at the Devika Rani and Roerich estate on the outskirts of the city. “It will be one which the entire country is proud of,” he said.

419,['9/01/2020'],CCP’s request for toilets through Sulabh denied,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: The department of urban development (municipal administration) has rejected the Corporation of the City of Panaji ’s (CCP) request to build 300-odd toilets through the Sulabh International social services organisation to make the city open defecation free ( ODF ).

In a letter to CCP, the department sought a detailed justification as to why the proposed work should be taken up through Sulabh International “when alternatively CCP can tender the work and construct the said toilets”.

“The approval to Sulabh International was as per GSR 2015 and was based on reasonability of rates and was given on nomination basis on the justification of the impending ODF deadline. CCP is not due for ODF re-certification in the next three months and therefore, work can be tendered,” stated the department’s assistant accounts officer in a letter dated January 3, in reply to CCP’s October 30 request for approval.

Meanwhile, terming this as an “injustice” to the civic body, Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar told reporters, “After all these months they’re now telling us to tender it. If we knew they were not going to give permission, we would have tendered it a long time back. There are many formalities involved in tendering. If it is a single tender we will have to re-tender it and time will be wasted. Then the monsoon will start. When will we build the toilets? They’re forcing us to tender it and give the contract to a private agency while toilets for the rest of the municipalities are being built through Sulabh International.”

“Panaji is not ODF,” he said, adding that people are openly defecating in Miramar and Caranzalem.

“We didn’t want Goa to get a bad name and hence, we took a resolution and declared Panaji ODF. Sulabh International is a government agency and there’s no requirement to tender the work,” Madkaikar said, adding that he would write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as chief minister Pramod Sawant and urban development minister Milind Naik, over the said issue.

Madkaikar, in September, had stated that all CCP corporators had been “pressurised” into signing certificates in August stating that their wards were ODF. Further, he said that they had been assured that construction of toilets would begin immediately.

Nashik: The civic body, in order to bring students closer to nature and inform them about different species of plants, has decided to develop gardens at municipal schools where adequate space is available.

The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has shortlisted as many as 20 schools where these gardens are to be developed. “This new concept will be introduced in municipal schools from the financial year 2020-21. Initially, we have selected 20 civic schools that have adequate open space and playground,” an official from the NMC said.

“After the gardens are developed, students will be informed about different species of plants and trees, and the importance of green cover. They will also be involved in maintenance of gardens. These students are the future of the country. If we can manage to develop interests among them about nature then they will conserve trees and forest,” he added.

Earlier, there were a total of 126 municipal schools, but 36 were merged with other schools owing to inadequate strength of students. A decision in this regard was taken around two years back by the then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe.

With the merger of 36 schools, the numbers of municipal schools have been reduced to 90. These schools have a total of 27,587 students — 13,277 boys and 14,310 girls.

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game is taking efforts to improve the quality of education in municipal schools. He is also encouraging teachers to impart quality education to the students.

As part of this, a team of total 45 principals and teachers of various municipal schools were sent on a study tour to Wablewadi school in Pune. The NMC is also taking efforts to make some schools as model schools to impart quality education along with best infrastructure and e-learning methods.

421,['9/01/2020'],Andhra Pradesh: Illegal quarrying threatens stone engraving from 1513,"This story is from January 9, 2020

VIJAYAWADA: One of the biggest rock engravings in Andhra Pradesh is now reportedly under serious threat due to illegal stone quarrying at Chalivendula village of Hindupur mandal in Anantapur district.

E Sivanagi Reddy, CEO of Cultural Centre of Vijayawada and Amaravati (CCVA), who visited the spot on Wednesday, explained that the Kannada inscription measuring 20ft in length and 18ft in width holds significant record of incised drawings of Virupanna, the builder of the famous Veerabhadra temple at Lepakshi and footprints of Lord Siva.

“The inscription was copied and published by the Epigraphy branch of Archaeological Survey of India in 1917 and, by the State Dept of Archaeology & Museum under the supervision of professor P Chenna Reddy, the then director of the department. in the year 2009,” Sivanagi Reddy told TOI.

Reddy said that the inscription—dated to August 6, 1513 AD—is of historical importance as it records the genealogy of the Vijayanagara kings in various states of Andhra Pradesh. The inscription says that it was at the request of Virapanna, son of Nandi Lakkisetti and Muddamamba, that the king of Vijayanagara Empire gave Chalivendula village—surnamed as Achutendrapura—in the presence of the god Virapaksha on the bank of the river Tungabhadra to Virupanna for his services to the god Virabhadra, Raghunatha and Papavinasa of Lepakshi. “The engraving may be lost unless the quarrying activity is stopped immediately and declare it as a protected site and erect barbed wire fencing for safe guarding it,” Reddy added.

The inscription also records the donations of the village towards the construction of the world-famous Lepakshi Temple which could now potentially turn out to be a simple building material. Reddy requested the officials of the state archaeology department to divert tourists visiting Lepakshi Temple to the Chalivendula inscription spot by erecting a notice board, appointing an archaeological tourist guide and security personal.

NEW DELHI: In a rare surgery , doctors at a private hospital in Gurugram recently conducted liver transplant on a year-old girl weighing 5.2 kg using only one segment of the liver donated by her mother.A liver has eight segments. Normally, for living donor transplant where the donor is an adult and recipient is a small child, two out of these eight segments are used. However, doctors at Artemis hospital said due to the low weight of the baby girl, who suffered from a congenital disorder — Biliary Atresia — in which the connecting duct between the liver and the intestines is either absent or malformed since birth, transplanting even two segments wasn’t possible. It carried the risk of insufficient blood flow to the revascularised liver.Therefore, the surgeons separated segment II and III of the liver that have longer blood vessels and used only segment III for the transplant. The baby girl had an underdeveloped portal vein — a blood vessel that carries blood from the gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, pancreas and spleen to the liver. To reduce the risk of reduced blood flow, the surgeons replaced it with a bovine jugular vein.Dr Giriraj Bora, joint chief, liver transplant and senior consultant, gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary surgery at Artemis Hospital, said bovine graft vein is used in cardiac surgeries but this is a rare instance when it was used in liver transplantation. “The liver transplant was carried out on November 23. The baby has recovered well from it,” Dr Bora added.Born as a third child to parents Ahmed and Sarah, the child had unusually prolonged and deep jaundice months after her birth. Doctors in Saudi Arabia, country she belongs to, diagnosed her with biliary atresia. They conducted biliary bypass surgery also but that was unsuccessful and unsatisfactory and therefore the girl was advised liver transplantation by the doctors in Saudi Arabia. However, considering her poor nutritional status and body weight (5.2kg) doctors in Saudi Arabia were reluctant and unwilling to perform such a complex liver transplant and she was referred to India.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73165433,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-426283,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/low-weight-baby-undergoes-transplant-as-doctors-use-an-eighth-of-donors-liver/articleshow/73163724.cms
425,['9/01/2020'],Karnataka set to hike housing unit cost post budget: Minister V Somanna,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Housing minister V Somanna addresses the media in Mangaluru on Wednesday

MANGALURU: Housing minister V Somanna said, “The per-unit cost of houses constructed under various housing schemes in the state is set to increase , after the presentation of the state budget. While the government at present sanctions Rs 1.2 lakh as unit cost, this could well be slightly more than double to Rs 2.5 lakh. The housing department will also look at a realistic target of constructing 2 lakh houses per financial year from April 1, 2020.”

In a chat with media on Wednesday, Somanna said, “I have already urged chief minister B S Yediyurappa to increase the limit to Rs 2.5 lakh and I’m certain that he will do so. The limit could at least be enhanced to Rs 2 lakh.”

This hike is a must, given the steep hike in cost of construction materials, Somanna said, adding this move will also give a fillip to the Union government’s ambition to provide housing for all in rural and urban areas by 2022.

Expressing dismay at the rot that had set in the housing department since the time he was in charge there, Somanna, without naming the governments or people in charge of the department,said,

“An inquiry ordered since I took over has helped unearth large-scale irregularities in housing targets with cowsheds, pigsties and goat sheds all being counted as dwelling units,” he said, adding the government has withdrawn grants allocated for around 7 lakh such homes.

“While grants for 5.95 lakh homes were withdrawn at the government level, grants for an additional 1.05 lakh homes were stopped following a high-level inquiry carried out by the chief secretary,” he said.

On the other hand, the government has sanctioned Rs 211 crore to help genuine beneficiaries spread across 173 assembly constituencies whose projects were locked out from the system for various reasons, by restoring them and releasing funds through respective ZP CEOs, he said.

Blaming his predecessors for stopping practices initiated by him to check fraudulent dealings including GPS tagging of houses, Somanna said the department is coming up with an app that will help nodal officers monitor progress real-time.

The process of scrutiny of housing applications will be reduced to 15 days, he said, adding discussions are on to transfer grants directly to accounts of beneficiaries, as was done in case of those affected by recent floods.

Appreciating the resolve of officials such as Satyabhama C, CEO, Chitradurga ZP, and Rohini Sindhuri, commissioner for sericulture development, in eliminating housing scheme frauds in their operational areas, he said housing schemes will be on track if there are officers of their kind.

“Rohini shut down an ‘inspection charge’ of Rs 75,000 that officials charged for a house of Rs 3 lakh given to sericulturists by the department,” the minister said.

Vijayawada: Drug Control Administration (DCA) officials cracked the whip on the online sale of medicines and initiated action against leading pharmacy portals like 1mg.com, phareasy.com, zoylo and netmeds.com. The director general of DCA , Kripa Nand Tripathi Ujela, in a statement on Wednesday, said that selling medicine online is not allowed according to the injunction order given by the Delhi high court.

The Drugs Controller General of India has recently sent a communication to the DCA to take action against online pharmacies selling medicine without licenses. Raids were conducted across the state on Wednesday over sale of medicine through websites.

During the raids at Guntur, officials found one Medrem Pharma Private Limited found to be selling medicine online. Officials also found other irregularities at Medrem Pharma following which their license was suspended.

“Officials have identified that the suppliers of these websites are located in Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and action is being initiated against them,” said Ujela.

Ujela further directed officials to make sure that no pharmacy in the state sells medicine online till further orders. “Online sale of drugs may lead to misuse and abuse of several drugs like habit-forming drugs, medicine used in termination of pregnancies, and other prescription drugs which are to be used under doctors supervision, as improper use of medicine will develop resistance to antibiotics,” he added.

NEW DELHI: Police received 11 complaints regarding the clashes at JNU and forwarded them to Crime Branch for inquiry on Wednesday. While seven complaints were from JNUSU members, including president Aishe Ghosh , three were from ABVP. One was from a professor.

In her complaint, Ghosh said she received a call about congregation of a group of people and some ABVP supporters carrying rods, sledgehammers and sticks at Ganga bus stop . She informed senior police officers about it. She also spoke to a policeman posted on the campus.

When the peace march by JNU Teachers’ Association got over, students and teachers started panicking and ran towards the Sabarmati T-point. She then noticed a mob with faces covered pelting stones and running after the students.

She went to an eatery nearby and tried to calm down the students and pleaded with the mob to not attack the students. However, she was caught and dragged behind a car by 20-30 people, who hit her with a rod. The men then kicked and punched her. One of the attackers, who was wearing a sweatshirt, didn’t have his face covered and she could identify him.

Manish Jangid, an ABVP member pursuing his PhD in environmental sciences, filed a counter complaint on Tuesday night. Jangid sustained a fracture on his left hand and bruises on his body after being attacked by a mob. He said he and others had gone to get their registration done at the admin block when the mob approached them.

“Satish Chandra Yadav, JNUSU general secretary, was leading the mob. Aishe Ghosh was also a part of them. I and my three friends, including two women, saw the lock of a room broken and hid there. We locked the door, but the mob broke it open and called us by our names and hit us. I then ran out the back gate and reached the mess. I fell unconscious and was later rushed to a hospital in an ambulance,” Jangid said.

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) is planning to outsource the operations of new Bytco hospital building to a private organisation or medical trust owing to manpower issues.

After getting poor response to the expression of interest (EoI) — floated around three months ago to appoint an organisation for running the super-speciality services at the hospital at minimum cost for city residents as per NMC’s terms and conditions — the civic body is planning to float the EoI for the second time.

The newly-constructed building of Bytco hospital, constructed at a cost of over Rs 40 crore, is lying idle for over five months as the NMC is yet to provide manpower, including doctors and nurses, for making the building operational.

The five-decade-old Bytco hospital, managed by the civic body, is one of the busiest hospitals in the city. The NMC had decided to build an additional building due constant increase of footfall at the hospital.

The new 200-bed building has a modular operation theatre. “The functioning of the new building is yet to start as the NMC is facing severe manpower issues at the existing Bytco hospital. We had sent a proposal to the state government for allowing us to appoint additional manpower for various departments, including health. But the state government is yet to give its nod,” a civic official said.

Recently during a meeting with the head of departments, municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game had directed the health department to explore possibilities whether the staff can be hired on contract basis to make the new hospital building operational.

“We will require specialists from cardiologists to oncologists to run the new super-specialist hospital. There have been many approved posts lying vacant in NMC’s existing hospitals, but recruitment is on hold due to lack of government permission,” an NMC official said.

“Around five months back, we had sent a proposal to the state government to recruit at least 150 vacant posts in the medical departments of NMC, but we are yet to get the nod,” he added.

The official said that the civic body is now planning to rope in an organisation that will run this new Bytco hospital and provide super-speciality services to residents at minimum cost. “We will soon invite the EoI from various organisations ready to operate this new hospital as per our terms and conditions,” the NMC official said.

“Although the new hospital is yet to become operational, we are planning to provide MRI and CT scan facilities at the ground floor of the new hospital building for the benefit of the patients. We have already started the work for installations of the machines. These facilities will be operational in the next four-five months,” he added.

Representative image

PANAJI: Consumers can participate in a public hearing scheduled on February 5 on the electricity department's tariff proposal for the year 2020-2021.

Consumers have been requested to send in their suggestions and objections to the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) which will conduct the hearing as well as the Goa electricity department by February 3.

The power tariff is likely to rise in April, with the electricity department proposing a hike of 3.84%.

In its proposed tariff structure, the department is looking at cumulatively billing low tension consumers at a uniform rate for the entire consumption instead of the present staggered slab rate billing.

The new tariff structure has been proposed for low tension domestic, commercial and industries categories of consumers.

All low tension domestic consumers “whose consumption is more than 200 units shall lose the benefit of the first two slabs i.e. 0-100 and 101-200 units for the energy charges. Further, total monthly consumption of more than 200 units shall fall in the respective slab and accordingly applicable energy charges for that respective slab will be levied,” the department has stated.

There was no power tariff hike proposed by the department for the financial year 2019-2020 where the department informed JERC that it would meet the revenue gap of Rs 308 crore through state government’s budgetary support.

Consumers have been asked to send in objections and suggestions through post or email to the secretary JERC at secretaryjerc@gmail.com with a copy to the electricity department aeipm@yahoo.com by February 3.

“Reports published by you (media) showed how some people locked the server room and nobody was allowed to use it. This should not be forgotten. This is not the meaning of education. This is against the education. Stopping students from registering themselves in education process is an anti-education attempt,” the minister said

“I have full faith that all masked man will be unmasked during police investigation. Police is investigating the entire episode,” Javadekar said. On why police have registered cases against protesting students, who have also been injured, Javadekar said, “Please obtain the right information from police why the FIR has been filed. If there is an FIR for locking the server room and stopping others from registration and educational activities, you will also change your views.”

433,['9/01/2020'],A-I seats bill to be placed in assembly,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Kolkata: The bill on de-reservation of Anglo-Indian seats in Parliament and state assemblies, which was passed in Parliament on December 12, will be placed in the state legislative assembly for its ratification on Thursday. The state is likely to veto it and send it back to Parliament. As per rules, the bill has to be passed by at least half the number of states of the country.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been vehemently protesting against CAA and NRC , and who has been known to be supporting the Anglo-Indian community in its demand for continuing with the reservation in legislature, is likely to be present in the House on Thursday. A large representation of TMC MLAs is also likely.

In the assembly, Anglo-Indian MLA Shane Calvert will speak on why the reservation is necessary. “I have prepared my appeal and I hope to convince the House that the Anglo-Indians need this reservation for socio-economic protection. The entire fabric of de-reservation is based on false notions,” Calvert told TOI.

He added that this is the only community that finds mention in the Constitution and the framers thought that the minority community needed this reservation just as the SC/STs do, for the protection of their rights.

Incidentally, members of the community from across the country had converged in the city on Monday to discuss how to start a concerted movement against the de-reservation, that comes into effect on January 25.

Saligao: The Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC) has decided to provide paper bags to shopkeepers as well as fruit/sweet vendors at the Bodgeshwar zatra in Mapusa. The zatra, currently underway, draws thousands of devotees who pay their obeisance to the lord Bodgeshwar.

The MMC, which sought the assistance of the Rotary Club of Mapusa, handed over around 65,000 paper bags to the temple committee. The move follows a loan by the Goa State Urban Development Agency (GSUDA) to ensure that paper bags are provided. Thus, the civic body has formed teams headed by municipal inspectors empowered to challan anyone using single-use plastic . The MMC has also placed 30 bins around the temple.

MMC chairperson Ryan Braganza on Wednesday said that the municipality, along with GSUDA, implemented the drive to ban single-use plastic. “This is the third year the municipality, in co-ordination with the temple committee and GSUDA, has tried to put the drive into practice,” he said.

“The municipality has distributed around 1,200 plastic containers to put offerings in, thus the use of plastic bags will be reduced drastically,” said Braganza

MMC chief officer Clen Madeira said that the municipality has installed around eight portable bio-toilets and incurred an expenditure of Rs 1.6 lakh.

“I request the people to maintain the sanctity of the place, not dispose waste in the open, use bins which are placed at strategic locations, and shun the use of plastic,” said Madeira.

435,['9/01/2020'],Mangaluru: Pejawar seer’s demise stokes demand to rename Jokatte railway station,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Jokatte Railway station

MANGALURU: The passing away of the seer of Pejawar Adhokshaja Mutt Vishwesha Teertha has stoked a demand among train activists to rename Jokatte railway station as Pejawar. While train activists are pushing for this demand based on popular sentiment, authorities of Palakkad division of Southern Railway (SR), under whose jurisdiction Jokatte station is located, feel there is no need to rename the station and it should remain as it is.

Jokatte station is located between Mangaluru Junction and Thokur railway stations on the Mangaluru-Mumbai railway corridor under SR in Pejawar village, Malavoor gram panchayat. Renaming of the station was also the wish of Sri Vishwesha Teertha, who in February 2017 said the station should be named as Pejawar station, since it was located within the limits of Pejawar village. The station was then under construction, and got completed later.

This is not a new demand but an old one that train activists have been making ever since Palakkad division started construction of the railway station in 2016, said train activist Gopalakrishna Bhat. Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel, then Mulki-Moodbidri MLA K Abhayachandra Jain, Malavoor gram panchayat and other stakeholders too had endorsed the demand of the late seer. Despite this, SR named the station as Jokatte, he said.

Renaming the station as Pejawar Railway Station would have been an ideal tribute to the departed octogenarian seer, revered as a saint by not just his followers, but society as well, Bhat said. Malavoor GP in October 2017 had adopted a resolution that panchayat residents, gram sabhas and its members have been demanding that the new station coming up between Kenjar and Pejawar be named as Pejawar, Bhat said to further buttress his case.

Then leader of the opposition in state legislative council and minister Kota Srinivas Poojari in January 2019, in a letter to railway minister Piyush Goyal, had drawn the latter’s attention to this popular demand. The coastal district has the unique distinction of having a ‘moola mutt’ of one of the Ashta Mutts of Udupi Sri Krishna Temple at Pejawar, and the railway station there should be named as Pejawar station, Poojari had urged Goyal.

Pratap Singh Shami, divisional railway manager, Palakkad division, said Jokatte was the ideal name for the railway station, and that there was no need to change it. Asserting he was not aware of any demand to initially name or rename the station as Pejawar station since he assumed office, he said the station’s name will remain Jokatte. Incidentally, a vinyl name board at Jokatte stahad been torn up in March 2018.

Done

Nashik: A surprise inspection of mid-day meals being provided to the students of civic schools by 13 private agencies under the central kitchen scheme was conducted by the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials on Tuesday.

A total of 13 teams — comprising civic and FDA officials along with dieticians — were formed by the NMC to inspect the quality of foods being provided by these agencies.

The teams also visited the kitchens of these agencies where the meal is prepared. Now, a report will soon be prepared and submitted by the teams to municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game.

The General Body (GB) of the NMC had recently ordered the civic administration to cancel the contracts of all 13 agencies following complaints regarding sub-standard food and violation of conditions.

Mayor Satish Kulkarni had ordered the civic administration to cancel the contracts and allot the work of providing mid-day meal to women self-help groups. The directive came after leader of opposition from Shiv Sena Ajay Boraste had raised the issue during the GB meeting.

Principals of 13 municipal schools had also lodged complaints with the NMC’s education department about the quality of food being provided by these contractors and how they are violating the terms and conditions for providing mid-day meal to municipal school students.

As per the set terms and conditions, it was mandatory to bring mid-day meal for students in air-proof containers and closed vans. But the meal was being brought in open containers.

Corporators cutting across the party lines reiterated the same complaint and demanded cancellation of contracts of the existing 13 contractors. However, the civic administration is yet to cancel the contracts.

A civic official said that the teams were formed to check the quality of food being served to the students. “Reports will soon be submitted to the municipal commissioner in next few days and based on the report action will be taken against the contractors,” he said.

Vadakattu Sanskruti and BMV Aditya

HYDERABAD: The New Year couldn’t have begun on a better note for Vadakattu Sanskruti and BMV Aditya. The duo from Hyderabad will be part of the 10-member Indian contingent of ballkids for the Australian Open , the year’s first tennis Grand Slam tournament, beginning in Melbourne on January 20.

The rest of the ballkids comprise players from Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Gurugram, Chandigarh, Panchkula and Delhi. After the successful first edition of Ball Kids programme in 2019, this year’s selection programme was held in 10 cities in the lead-up to the tournament. The final squad was selected by Australian Open officials after putting the kids through a series of gruelling tests such as ball rolling technique, service skills, short sprints, written test, communication skills and overall personality.

In a selection that witnessed intense competition, 250 players were shortlisted from 1,500 applicants and called to Delhi for trials. The list was further pruned to 100 and from that 10 were selected also for their agility and quick hand-eye coordination.

14-year-old, Sanskruti who is standard 9 student of Gitanjali Devshala, Balamrai was also overjoyed at the prospect of seeing and meeting her idols, Rafael Nadal and Germany’s Angelique Kerber. “It gives me an opportunity to watch my idols live on court, which would be a treat,” she added.

Sanskruti was grateful to her school and coach for helping her realise this dream. “I thank my school management without which my tennis career would not have been possible. training and selection of Ballkids programme was very tough. We were trained by Shiva Kumar Reddy. He trained 25 of us in Hyderabad. Varshit, who was selected from Hyderabad last year, also guided us by sharing his experience,” Sanskruti said.

For Aditya too, it’ll be a heady experience, celebrating his 15th birthday (Jan 27) at the Open. A standard IX student of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Jubilee Hills, Aditya is a bronze medallist at the Khelo India National games. “I’m very excited to represent India and it will be a dream come true for me to watch my favourite stars in action,” said the right-hander who, like Sanskruti, idolises world No. 1 Nadal of Spain.

Manohar Bhat, vice-president, Kia Motors India, wished all the ballkids well. “It is great to see so many enthusiasts believing in their passion for the sport,” he said.

Mumbai: In a significant order, the Bombay high court on Wednesday granted bail to an approver in an organised crime case over an alleged Rs 10 crore extortion demand made by gangster Suresh Pujari from Malaysia. This is the first such order by Bombay HC of bail granted to an approver in a MCOCA case.

Sharad Agarwal (36) had approached HC after a special court designated under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) had rejected his bail in October 2019. His counsel Raja Thakare with advocates Pratap Nimbalkar and Siddharth Jagushte contended before Justice S K Shinde that though he was arraigned as an accused in the case, he was since granted pardon as an approver in September 2019 and thus entitled to bail.

Agarwal said he was falsely accused in the case and that he is a businessman with a travel firm, languishing in Thane central jail since 2015 after his arrest by Mumbai police as part of its investigation into the Pujari syndicate.

There is a statutory bar under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) on the release of an approver till completion of the trial, argued prosecutor Sharmistha Kaushik.

But Thakare argued since Agarwal was granted a pardon and since he now has “a status of a witness” and “has not breached any condition (if any) imposed on him while granting pardon”, the trial court erred in not applying its mind judiciously to his case.

Police received the sanction to prosecute under MCOCA in January 2016. A chargesheet was filed before the special MCOCA court in Mumbai against Agarwal and others.

The prosecution’s case is the complainant claimed to have received a call in September 2015 from an international number and the caller said he was Suresh Pujari from Malaysia and demanded Rs 10 crore.

The prosecution had before the special trial court recorded its “no objection” to release the applicant on bail, subject to the condition that he remain present before it on every hearing and not tamper with evidence.

Till date, only eight witnesses have been examined out of 41 and the approver has been in jail for over a year after being granted pardon under Section 307 of the CrPC, noted HC.

PATNA: One Sonu Thathera (19) was arrested on early Wednesday morning from Fatuha police station area in Patna district for allegedly raping a 17-year-old girl after dragging her to a secluded place near Fatuha railway station on Tuesday night.

Fatuha SDPO Maneesh said the victim had left her residence in Sheikhpura district as her parents were pressurising her to marry a man much older than her age. He said the victim boarded a train to Patna in the hope of getting some job. Her 14-year-old maternal cousin was also accompanying her.

“Sonu, who belonged to Nalanda but lived at Fatuha with his family, had boarded the same train at Barh and after listening to their conversation, offered his help to get her a job and shelter at night. However, Sonu started dragging her to a secluded place filled with vegetation after they came out of Fatuha station,” he said. The accused is married.

The SDPO said the victim’s cousin apprehended trouble and ran back to the station and alerted the railway protection force (RPF) personnel there. But by the time police could trace her, the girl was raped.

“An FIR was lodged on the victim’s statement. She had a cellphone number which was provided by Sonu while travelling with her. Police traced the accused on that basis and arrested him within six hours of the incident,” he said.

The SDPO said Sonu had broken his sim card but the cellphone he used to call the victim while travelling was seized along with the clothes he was wearing at the time of crime.

442,['9/01/2020'],RTI reply reveals JNU cut down on hiring of guards,"This story is from January 9, 2020

File photo used for representational purpose

NEW DELHI: The reply to an RTI query filed by a former JNUSU president has revealed that the university inked a pact with a security agency to hire 250 security guards last year, which, sources said, was lower than the earlier requirement of 400 or above.

The RTI reply, which was received 10 days before the violence broke out on Sunday on JNU campus, gave out details of the new contract for the security agency. While the initial tender had mentioned the requirement for 400 personnel — ex-servicemen, with a contract period of two years — the agreement later signed with Army Welfare Placement Organisation and Cyclops Security and Allied Service Private was for 250 guards.

Former JNUSU president N Sai Balaji, who had filed the RTI, said: “If JNU needed only 250 security personnel as per the new contract, then why was the administration paying money for 200 extra guards to an agency earlier?”

He alleged that the administration had cut down the security on campus, which had ultimately rendered it unsafe. “The university was paying Rs 35,000 per guard to the security company earlier and the number of personnel was higher. Now, around Rs 50,000 per person is being paid to the company while the number of guards has come down. This is akin to compromising the security of the campus,” Balaji claimed.

When contacted, JNU registrar Pramod Kumar said the requirement was lowered following an audit conducted for “efficiency of security on campus”.

Nashik: The left organisations on Wednesday took out a rally in the city in support of the Bharat Bandh called by trade unions across the country.

Barring some industrial units, production process in majority of the units was unaffected. Similarly, the operations in the banking sector remained unaffected.

In addition, the members of different trade unions staged a roadblock in the Peth area of rural Nashik for some time.

“Around 90% establishments participated in the one-day strike to protest against the anti-worker and farmers’ policies of the Union government and to press for various demands. We received good response from different sectors, including industries, banks, post offices, zilla parishad, Nashik Municipal Corporation and other establishments,” said Raju Desle, state secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress.

An action committee of different trade unions was formed to make the strike successful. A long march was organised from the Golf Club ground to district collectorate as part of the protest.

A delegation of different trade unions met district collector Suraj Mandhare and presented a memorandum of their demands, seeking minimum wages of Rs 21,000 per month to workers in all establishments, minimum Rs 10,000 per month pension to farmers and workers, abolishment of contract system in permanent works, reducing taxes by centre and state governments on fuel to reduce the prices and immediate recruitment on 24 lakh vacant posts in the central and state governments.

Sisodia said the AAP government had transformed the education system of the city

NEW DELHI: Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) functionary Manish Sisodia on Wednesday launched a fresh attack against BJP on the issue of the closure of government schools in BJP-ruled states .

At a press conference, Sisodia said that the AAP government has transformed the education system of the city. While it added 20,000 classrooms in schools, 1.3 lakh students left private schools to join government schools, said the deputy chief minister.

“Enrolment in BJP-run municipal schools, which are in bad shape, has witnessed a sharp decline,” he added.

“This election will be fought on the basis of real work. Education has been our priority in the five years that we have governed Delhi,” Sisodia said.

He added that the schools were in pathetic condition when his party assumed power in 2015. ""Under the AAP government, 20,000 classrooms have been constructed of which 8,000 have already been handed over. The government has invested significantly in infrastructure and facilities like green boards, modular desks and world-class sports facilities. We have built a total of 25 new school buildings and 30 are under construction. Six Schools of Excellence and five Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalayas are transforming the lives of the students,” Sisodia said, adding that Delhi now has several government schools with better infrastructure than private schools.

Slamming the governance model of BJP-ruled states, Sisodia claimed that the Haryana government had shut down 208 government schools between 2015 and 2018. In the same period, the Rajasthan government closed down 4,000 schools, he said. “In UP, more than 40% of primary schools do not have electricity supply. In Delhi, 109 primary schools have been shut down by the municipal corporations in the last nine years, with the number going down from 1,764 in 2011-12 to 1,655 in 2019-20,” he added.

Sisodia stated that enrolment in municipal schools has declined by 1.3 lakh in the last four years (2015-16 to 2018-19) whereas the enrolment in Delhi government schools has increased by 6,000 in the corresponding period. The enrolment in elementary schools in BJP and Congress-ruled states has only decreased in the last four years – a decrease of 14 lakh in UP, 4.2 lakh in Haryana and one lakh in Punjab. The figures were derived from the Central government data on elementary education, Sisodia claimed.

Sisodia said that the AAP government has upgraded sporting infrastructure in schools. ""Delhi now has four synthetic athletics tracks; four more are nearing completion; and three synthetic hockey turfs and two synthetic football grounds are ready. Six state-of-the-art swimming pools are ready and nine more are nearing completion. We have also constructed two synthetic basketball courts. Two sports hostels with training facilities are nearing completion and an archery field and a synthetic volleyball court are getting ready,” he said.

BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana, however, rubbished Sisodia’s claims about municipal schools and said that he was no person to judge the education standards in other BJP-ruled states.

“A total of 763 Delhi government schools do not have principals, only 30% schools teach science and the AAP government has outsourced mathematics teaching,” Khurana said. He claimed that the AAP government spent only 30% of the education budget.

PONDA: Resolving farmers ’ dilemma over whether to cultivate sugarcane or not, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday assured them that the Sanjivani Co-operative Sugar Factory at Dharbandora will procure sugarcane from them and told them to continue cultivating the crop.

The government’s decision to keep the factory shut during this year’s crushing season had put the farmers in a predicament. Sawant said it was immaterial whether the cane would be crushed at the factory’s new plant or whether it would be sent to some other factory and assured them Sanjivani would procure their produce next year.

Presently, as the factory is not in production, it procures cane from Goa’s farmers and sends it to Laila Sugar Factory at Khanapur in Karnataka.

The chief minister also assured the farmers that the harvesting rate for their cane will be raised from Rs 200 to Rs 600 per tonne from this year.

He, however, said he could not hike canes rate from the existing Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 per tonne. The factory has been paying Rs 1,200 and in addition the agriculture department pays a support price of Rs 1,800.

PANAJI: The Centre on Wednesday constituted a two-member committee to inquire into the tiger deaths and asked for its report within seven days.

The panel consists of Rajendra Garawad of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), Bengaluru and regional deputy director, western region, Mumbai.

Deputy inspector general of forest (NTCA) Nishant Verma said the team would inquire into the cause of death, action taken by the forest authorities and compliance of the standard operating procedure issued by the government with regards to tiger death and disposal of the carcass.

The committee also has to suggest legal course of action as per the provision of the Wildlife (Protection) Act.

Earlier, health minister Vishwajit Rane sought central inquiry into the tiger deaths and “requested” Union forest minister Prakash Javadekar to send a team to conduct a “detailed investigation” into it.

Meanwhile, science and technology minister Michael Lobo said the perpetrators should be jailed for 20 years for the crime. “It’s the darkest day in the history of Goa in terms of biodiversity conservation, especially the national animal,” he said.

He said to resolve the man-animal conflict, there should be rehabilitation of the inhabitants in such areas.

Kolhapur: The city government administration came to a standstill with normal life being partially affected during the Bharat bandh called by the leftist trade unions on Wednesday.

The bandh saw markets were closed for few hours with primary schools and colleges functioning to its usual working hours but high schools were closed. The Swabhimani shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) staged rasta rook at various places thus disturbing the routine activities in the rural Kolhapur .

Most of the government employees and officials stayed away from the work, as they condemned the central government’s anti-labor policies. The officials were shouting slogans outside the office and staging a sit out near town hall in the afternoon. Few officials were seen in the government offices as they had no idea about the strike.

Shivaji University functioned normally. S D Lad, president of district education platform said, “Over 40,000 employees from around 4,000 schools in Kolhapur district, including teaching and non-teaching staff and aided and un-aided schools participated in the nationwide agitation for our long-pending demands. The schools were kept shut and no academic activities were performed to show the support of the bandh.”

When contacted Asha Ubale, District education officer (primary), Kolhapur, said that there were reports of the schools remained shut especially from the secondary education sector. “We are yet to receive any confirmation about whether teachers from the primary schools participated in the bandh,” she added.

Khanderao Jagdale, member of the teachers’ body from the unaided schools of Kolhapur district said that staff members from all the unaided schools (primary and secondary) participated in the bandh.

Kolhapur municipal corporation functioned normally as employees union extended support to the strike but did not participate. As a result, the bus service of Kolhapur municipal transport remained unaffected. Shops and other commercial establishments were closed for a few hours in the morning while other industrial units in surrounding areas remained closed during bandh period.

Traffic on national highway 4 remained unaffected during bandh period even as workers of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) staged rasta-roko at various places. SSS workers, led by Raju Shetti blocked Kolhapur-Sangli road at Ankli. Bandh evoked good response, where SSS influences Kolhapur district. Traffic at Ankli was disrupted for an hour. The incidents of Rasta Roko was reported from Bidshed, Haldi, Sangrul phata in Karveer taluka, at Bambawade in Shahuwadi taluka and from other places.

Kolhapur: The experts from Architects and Engineers (AE) Association suggested several measures to reduce the flood intensity of Panchganga river .

A meeting was held between the delegation of AE and the officials of various agencies led by the district collector Daulat Desai on Wednesday. They discussed several issues mainly about the floods and regional planning.

Senior architect Rajendra Sawant said, “We have to ensure that the intensity of the floods is reduced. The buildings constructed in the prohibitive zone have to be flood-proof. The blue flood line may be extended if the flooding continues to be affected by man-made reasons.”

The suggestions made in the meeting include removal of all the obstructions in the river flow, flood protection work should be undertaken, the city’s development plan should be made keeping the flooding situation in mind, sediments should be removed from the river and agricultural activities along the river banks should be stopped.

Some of the architects and engineers objected to the flood lines published recently by the water resources department. They said that the flood lines will hamper the development activities and some claimed that the developers are ready to make changes to avoid the loss of the properties and lives in case of the floods.

The other issue discussed was related to the regional plan. The experts said that there are several flaws in the plan which has been approved by the state government last year.

“We highlighted the issue of the small hamlets which are 50 years to 200 years old. These hamlets should be brought into the Gaothan (village limit) areas for regulated development. To make the changes in the development rules, we decided to send a proposal to the state government for clear guidelines. In the next meeting we are going to discuss the issues of unified development rules and Kolhapur Urban Area Development Authority (KUADA),” said Ajay Korane, president of AE.

455,['9/01/2020'],Mumbai: 2019 sees lowest road fatalities in 9 years,"Representative image

MUMBAI: The lowest number of road fatalities on Mumbai’s streets in nine years were recorded in 2019 . As many as 403 people were killed in 378 fatal crashes. The fatalities last year were down 15% compared with 2018 and were 28% lower than in 2011. Traffic police attributed the reduction to crash data analysis, design-oriented interventions and stricter enforcement. But motorists said increased congestion due to ongoing infrastructure projects had reduced vehicle speeds and that too was a factor in decreasing crashes.The number of accidental injuries—2,882 people hurt in 2,325 crashes—was the lowest since 2011. “We study crash data from previous years, analyse reasons and take corrective action. It could be something as simple as installing street lights in a dark lane or increasing the parapet wall of a bridge,” said Madhukar Pandey, joint commissioner, traffic.Pedestrians lose lives the most in road crashes in the city, as seen in previous years. Design interventions to making streets safer for pedestrians to cross has made a difference though. The intersections that were revamped include Nagpada junction, Bandra HP junction and, recently, the CD Barfiwala junction at Andheri. “As far as enforcement is concerned, our focus has been on curbing drunk driving, speeding, riding triple seat, talking on phone while driving and jumping signals,” said Pandey.From 2013 to 2015, fatalities climbed before dipping.Transport experts said fatalities can be minimised further if drivers are disciplined. “Motorcyclists are the biggest culprits when it comes to haphazard riding. Besides riding in the wrong direction and incorrectly overtaking from the left, they often squeeze into the gap between a BEST bus and a pavement hitting the passenger getting off a bus. More punitive measures, a strict driving licence-issuing system and more education are required,” said activist Ashok Datar. He added tackling the parking crisis should be a priority. “Vehicles parked on the footpath force people to walk on the carriageway, putting lives at risk.” Another expert said the state must implement heavy penalties given in amended Motor Vehicles Act. A system to recover every e-challan issued is needed too.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73164534,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-172878,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2019-sees-lowest-road-fatalities-in-9-years/articleshow/73162133.cms

NEW DELHI: As thousands protest against the new citizenship laws in different parts of Delhi, over towards the Haryana border in Najafgarh, these issues are deep down the pecking order. Reaching this far-flung area has become easier with the Delhi Metro making an ingress to Najafgarh and the Grey Line set to stretch it further to Dhansa. The transit pain alleviated, the people of this assembly constituency are focused on daily needs like infrastructure, water and electricity rather than national policies and legislations.The Najafgarh constituency has a core of Jats with an occupational mix of farming and trading . Employment is a concern in the area. “There has been considerable improvement in the last five years power and water supply, but jobs are still hard to come by,” said Ishwar Singh, a retired Delhi Transport Corporation employee. “The next generation, which is more educated, has to travel several hours from Najafgarh to find jobs.”The expectations the voters have of their political representatives are, therefore, high. In 2015, sitting Aam Aadmi Party MLA Kailash Gahlot (55,598) won the seat from Indian National Lok Dal’s Bharat Singh (54,043) by just over 1,500 votes. BJP’s Ajeet Singh Kharkhari finished third with 39,462 votes, while the Congress candidate had to settle for the fourth spot.Before Delhi Metro access, the Najafgarh road from Dwarka was constantly jammed and unable to cope with the traffic. With the Nangli and Najafgarh metro stations coming up on the same road, some of the burden of commuters has been lifted, but road users are still a grumpy lot.The metro connectivity was a promise made by Gahlot, who is Delhi’s transport minister. People say extension of the urban train network to Dhansa will help decongest the road and expect Gahlot, if elected, to complete the task. “The sitting MLA has done a lot of work. Water, schools and electricity have been improved and now with Delhi Metro reaching Dhansa, people will have a better time,” opined Sanjay Kumar, a resident of Mitraon.Mukesh Vats, a resident of Prem Nagar, was happy with the reduced electricity bills and the improved water supply, but he said space for recreation in each locality would be nice.“Hospitals and government schools were the priorities and we are satisfied with that. But maybe in the next five years, the government can focus on creating more parks,” said Vats.Shakuntala, a fruit seller who lives in Roshanpura, similarly said cheap water and electricity impacted the lives of everyone. “My electricity bill has reduced and I am delighted a new water pipeline has been laid. These are what are more important to most people.

MUZAFFARPUR: A 65-year-old retired senior excise official and his wife were found bludgeoned to death in their house at Gyan Lok Colony in Muzaffarpur town on Wednesday afternoon.

Ajay Kumar Sharma and his wife Renu were killed the previous night and their bodies were spotted the next day by a neighbour, who informed his elder brother. Sharma had retired as assistant inspector general from the state prohibition and excise department five years ago.

Police suspect robbery as a possible motive behind the murders as several household items, including a TV set and a tow-wheeler, were found missing. However, senior police officers who reached the spot, including SP (city) P K Mandal, refused to rule out foul play.

“I personally inspected the spot. It appears the couple was killed during robbery but we cannot arrive at any firm conclusion on the motive behind the crime,” SP (City) P K Mandal said, adding the stolen two-wheeler has been recovered.

The SP (city) along with DSP R N Paswan and SHO of Brahmapura police station had reached the spot around 1.30 pm after being informed by the Ajay’s elder brother Saroj Kumar Sharma, who is a lawyer at the local civil court.

“I got a phone call from a neighbour informing about the incident after which I rushed to my brother’s house. I found the dead body of my brother on bed and his wife Renu lying in a pool of blood below the bed. Their heads were bludgeoned with some heavy object , possibly iron rod or stick,” Saroj said, adding some household items were lying scattered in the house.

“Some valuables like television sets, a two wheeler (scooty) and several other items were missing from the house,” he told media persons.

Saroj, however, refused to speculate on the reason behind the crime. He informed that his brother’s wife Renu is the sister of Muzaffarpur deputy development commissioner Ujjwal Kumar Singh.

Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: The state government will come out with a shack policy for private shack owners next year, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday.

Several issues were raised by private shack operators at a meeting chaired by Sawant at Altinho, Panaji. They said that every season they face problems as the tourism department and civic bodies create hurdles due to which they had to approach the high court last year.

In the petition, the private shack owners association had sought a time-bound schedule for acceptance and disposal of applications to set up shacks in private properties. In November 2019, the high court of Bombay at Goa had directed panchayats and municipalities to dispose of pending application of private shack operators expeditiously considering that the shacks would be seasonal.

Responding to the issues raised by the Private Property Shack Owners Association, Sawant said that till a policy is put in place, the process to register private shack owners with the department of tourism will begin which will help give better facilities to the shack owners and also help the government generate revenue.

NAGPUR: In a desperate move to boost its revenue, the cash-strapped Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has increased rent of its leasehold shops, plots and ottas (platforms) between 4 and 231 times after linking the rent to the ready recknoer value of the property.

As the astronomical hike has made it nearly impossible to run businesses, several leaseholders have appealed to mayor and other office-bearers to reconsider the decision. A delegation of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT), led by president Dipen Agrawal, also met Maharashtra cabinet minister Nitin Raut and apprised him about the issue.

As per a chart presented by CAMIT, rent of one of the leased plots at Kadbi Square was Rs24,990 per annum. It increased to Rs57.95 lakh after the hike, making it a whopping 23,190% jump. Similarly, rent of a plot in Lakadganj increased from Rs6,970 to Rs11.57 lakh per annum, an increase of 16,613%. Rent of an otta for vegetable sellers in Cotton Market jumped from Rs660 to Rs12,744, an increase of 1,931%. Similar hikes have been effected in remaining markets also.

Acting on the complaints, mayor Sandip Joshi held a meeting with the leaseholders on January 4 and constituted a committee under BJP corporator Sanjay Bangale to review the rental policy. The committee will hear the grievances of the leaseholders and also discuss the matter with NMC officials before deciding on the new policy. The committee also comprises representatives of leaseholders — Moiz Burhani, Wallabh Parekh, Sanjay Nabira, NMC’s assistant commissioner (market) Vijay Humne, legal officer Venkatesh Kaple, market superintendent Shrikant Vaidya and deputy engineer of town planning department Shrikant Deshpande.

Agrawal told TOI that the NMC has made a major mistake by linking ready reckoner value with rent of the shops, plots and ottas. “NMC’s responsibility is to provide services to the people and not extract exorbitant revenue. These leaseholders facilitate various types of markets to the citizens like kirana, vegetables, fruits, flowers, wood products etc. Many of the leases are for 5-60 years. NMC leases these properties for 11 months, which is renewed from time-to-time,” said Agrawal, adding the civic body demands rent on monthly basis.

“NMC had revised the rent policy in 1992. Since then, it has been increasing rent by 10% every three years. The civic body revised the rent by linking it to ready reckoner value from April 1, 2018. After leaseholders under CAMIT and other associations raised the issue, the NMC reduced the rent by 50% in November 2018. Despite the reduction, the hike remains too stiff,” he pointed out.

Bangale said the committee will meet soon and come up with a new policy. “Nature of leasehold shops, plots and ottas are totally different, but all have been brought under the revised rent system without classifying them. This has resulted in hefty increase in the rents of all,” he said.

“Hike should be effected in regular intervals and not in one stroke. Need is to consider income of leaseholders, location of shops, plots, ottas and other factors. Due to the steep hike, many of the leaseholders stopped paying rent or paid as per old system, resulting in revenue loss for the civic body,” Bangale admitted, adding the committee will also explore the possibilities of long term revision instead of the present 11-month period.

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Wednesday demolished a wall obstructing visitors from parking their vehicles at the basement of a hospital located in Rajarampuri.

The municipal corporation has undertaken the task of clearing the basement parking of large establishments in the city.

Several complaints have been made to the civic body stating that the visitors are not allowed to park their vehicles at the basements and that they are forced to park on roads.

The complaints also mentioned about the inconvenience faced by visitors if their vehicles are confiscated by the traffic police department due to parking on roadside.

A senior civic official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The standing committee has given us directions to remove all the encroachments in the basement parking of large establishments. So far, we have issued notices to over 25 establishments including hotels, lodgings and hospitals. We have started the action after we found that the owners or operators of these establishments do not clear the encroachments on their own. On Wednesday, we demolished a wall constructed to obstruct the vehicles of the visitors to park their vehicles in the basement of the hospital. Similar action will be undertaken soon at other establishments.”

The civic body has focused on congested areas such as Rajarampuri, Shahupuri and Lakshmipuri. The residents of these areas have been asking the civic administration to take steps to make these areas congestion-free.

Recently, the municipal corporation conducted an anti-encroachment drive to remove hawkers from one of the busy lanes of Rajarampuri. MLA Chandrakant Jadhav has directed the KMC and the traffic department to make the lanes in Rajarampuri congestion-free on priority and then focus on the rest of the areas.

466,['9/01/2020'],Price row: Iconic mutton dishes go off the plate,"This story is from January 9, 2020

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: The iconic mutton dishes have gone off the menu of most hotels and restaurants in Kolhapur , the erstwhile princely state and a key southern city of Maharashtra, in a climax of the two-month row over the meat prices.

Since Monday, mutton shops have stopped selling the meat claiming that they cannot afford the Rs 480 per kg price fixed by a 25-member panel appointed by the district administration. They claim that the rate was forced upon them.

The fiery red curry (tambda rassa) and is mild counterpart white curry (pandhra rassa), along with the meat pickles and roasts, are the most famous delicacies from Kolhapur known across the country. Tourists visiting Kolhapur not just tread to the famous Mahalaxmi temple and then bag the iconic footwear, but do not miss out on a hearty meal of these culinary preparations.

Sanjay Kadam, a hotelier from Rajarampuri, said, “We have stopped serving mutton dishes. We have to convince the customers to relish other dishes. We are concerned about this mutton row since we are losing the customers.”

He added that around 80 to 100 dishes of mutton are served at his hotel daily, making up a large portion of his business. Hoteliers like him are hoping for a quick resolution to the price row.

Vijay Kamble, a mutton seller, said they share a close bond with the hoteliers. “We have provided quality mutton to the hoteliers whenever they demanded. The hoteliers are asking us to start the shops as they are not getting good quality mutton from outside. We will continue our strike. None from the administration approached us to start the shops,” he said.

Consumers are moving to hotels outside the city, where hoteliers have some access to local mutton from the rural hinterland.

Meanwhile, the forum demanding mutton at cheaper rates started one sale centre. They converted a tea shop from Rajarampuri into a mutton shop. Baba Indulkar, the convenor of the forum, said they got the goats certified from the KMC’s veterinary officer and provided mutton at Rs 480 per kg to the consumers. Indulkar claimed that over 60 kilogram of mutton was sold from the centre in just one day.

Asha workers at RBI square

NAGPUR: Work at Government Medical College , Mayo Hospital , Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)-run hospitals and health care centres, Regional Mental Hospital, and Daga Hospital remained badly affected after nurses and support staff comprising Class 4 employees joined nationwide strike call by Left unions on Wednesday.

Over 1,200 nurses from GMC and around 280 from Mayo did not report to work. Large number of Asha workers too struck work which is likely to impact the upcoming pulse polio drive on January 19. NMC staff under Urban National Health Mission also took a day off to join the demonstration at Samvidhan Square.

An official from GMC said resident doctors and nursing students were roped in as alternative arrangement for the day. Mayo dean Dr Ajay Keolia agreed it wasn’t business as usual but efforts were made to keep things under control. “The flow of patient was less due to rains but operations were performed as surgery department didn’t go on strike. All deliveries were conducted while post mortems too were done,” he said.

Keolia said the director of medical education and research had already issued instructions and meetings were held for making alternative arrangements. “First year classes too were held while a body donation was done at anatomy department,” he said.

At GMC, an official said though the medical services are covered under ESMA, many went on strike. “We will see if a day’s pay would be cut or any action taken against them. Medications and timely doses were affected and OPD too was hit because of lack of manpower,” the official added.

The situation was same at Regional Mental Hospital, NMC hospitals and Daga where patients and their relatives faced difficulties.

Representative image

PATNA: The CBI filed a supplementary chargesheet in the Srijan scam case against 10 people, including former Bhagalpur DM Virendra Yadav , before a special court in Patna on Wednesday.

The scam, which was handed over to the CBI for probe in 2017, is related to the transfer of around Rs 2,000 crore from several government bank accounts in Bhagalpur and others districts to accounts of an NGO Srijan Mahila Vikash Sahyog Samiti.

Sources said Yadav is the first IAS officer whose name surfaced officially so far after the case was handed over to the federal agency by the Nitish Kumar government. Initially, the scam was being probed by the economic offences unit of the state police.

CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said it’s a supplementary chargesheet in which Yadav has been named as an accused. Yadav, a 2004 batch Bihar cadre IAS officer, is currently posted as special secretary in the backward class and extremely backward class welfare department.

CBI sources said Yadav was posted as Bhagalpur DM for little over a year. “He was posted there as DM in the middle of 2014. It was during this period that the maximum amount of money was siphoned off from the bank account to the district land acquisition office,” CBI sources said, adding, more than Rs 300 crore was siphoned off into Srijan’s account from the land acquisition office’s bank account.

Agra: After the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC), the Agra-Mathura city bus transport service has also increased the fare by at least 10 paise per kilometer on different routes. On Wednesday, the increase in fare resulted in an argument between bus conductors and passengers. Customers said that no prior information was given regarding the fare hike.

Under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) scheme, the Agra- Mathura city transport service operates a total of 230 buses. Out of these 170 buses are operated in Agra and 60 buses in Mathura.

According to the revised rate, the fare from Agra Cantt to Bhagwan Talkies, the busiest route of the city, has been increased to Rs 25 from its previous rate of Rs 22.

The fare from Agra to Fatehabad has been increased from Rs 35 to 39. The fare from Agra to Pinahat has been increased from Rs 58 to 64.

Managing director of the Agra-Mathura city bus transport service RBL Sharma said, “Following the UPSRTC, minor increase has been made in the fare of city bus service. This will help in improving operations.”

Pratap Pura resident Sunil Verma said, “Fare bus has been increased without any prior information. Fare from Sai Ka Takia to Bhagwan Talkies was Rs 12 which has now been increased to Rs 15. I am factory worker and a daily commuter. The increase in fare does affect me. Increase in the bus fare is highly unreasonable. The UPSRTC administration should have ensured better facilities for the passengers before taking this decision.”

Khandari resident Naresh Yadav said, “Condition of the city buses is very poor. With broken glasses, the seats are in a wear and tear state in most of the buses. Following poor maintenance, buses make a lot of noise causing inconvenience to the passengers. Authorities should have made efforts to ensure safe and comfortable travel for passengers before increasing the fare.”

Kolhapur: State revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat has been appointed guardian minister of Kolhapur district.

The Congress MLA from Sangamner is also the president of Maharashtra Congress Committee and has been credited with forming the alliance with Shiv Sena to form the government in the state.

Thorat is considered as the loyalist of the central leadership of Congress.

Congress MLC and minister of state Satej Patil was the frontrunner for the post of the district guardian minister. However, Patil has been appointed as the district guardian minister of Bhandara district. Rural development minister and senior leader of Nationalist Congress Party Hasan Mushrif has been appointed the guardian minister of Ahmednagar district, Thorat’s home district.

According to the sources, the NCP had claimed to have its person as the guardian minister of Ahmednagar due to the victory of a large number of its MLA. A consensus seems to have reached between Congress and NCP and therefore Thorat has been given the post.

Thorat as the guardian minister will preside over the meetings of district planning and development council (DPDC). The first meeting of which is likely to take place soon.

The Congress local leaders are happy with Thorat’s appointment though a bit disappointed for Satej Patil.

Patil is probably the only MoS who has been appointed the guardian minister. The local Congress leader said that Thorat is the most compatible choice since for the first time in the recent years Congress has performed well in the district in assembly elections. Having the state president of the party as the guardian minister will help grow the party base in the district and in the region.

Water resources minister Jayant Patil has been appointed the guardian minister of his home district Sangli and Balasaheb Patil as the guardian minister of Satara district.

Kolhapur: The faculty members of colleges associated with the Shivaji University Teachers’ Association will protest against the vice-chancellor of Shivaji University, Kolhapur , (SUK) Devanand Shinde in front of chancellor’s office (Rajbhavan) in Mumbai on January 2, read a press statement from SUTA .

The SUTA members carried out a one-day protest against the VC over alleged irregularities at the SUK campus on Tuesday. The protesters said that they are demanding Shinde’s resignation over various lapses committed by him during his four-year tenure.

“We have had meetings to discuss the lapses with the V-C last year in the month of May. However, there was no action initiated by him. Hence, we have decided to continue protests against him. We had protested during the senate meeting earlier last month as well and had warned of more agitations,” a press statement from SUTA read.

It was alleged that there were irregularities on Shinde’s part in granting invalid affiliation to a Satara-based college. The said college was given fresh affiliation by the V-C. The affiliation of the said college was cancelled way back in June 2000, yet, the college was granted affiliation last year which violates the guidelines of the Maharashtra Universities Act.

Shinde has, in the past, denied all allegations against him claiming that they are baseless and fictional.

473,['9/01/2020'],Nagpur: Treated worse than animals: Axis Bank contract workers,"This story is from January 9, 2020

Question of livelihood

NAGPUR: New generation or private sector banks have largely remained insulated by the countrywide strike calls. On Wednesday, however, lower level work like data entry and house keeping was hit in Axis Bank .

As Bhartiya Kamgar Sena, the Shiv Sena-affiliated union for the first time responded to a strike call by Left and Congress unions, contract workers from Axis Bank also came out to protest. The small group holding saffron banners could be seen apart among scores of red flags of the communist unions. The workers not only complained of poor wages and lack of job security, but also insulting behaviour by their superiors.

“It’s for the first time that we have staged protests in a joint forum like this. The only union under Bharatiya Kamgar Sena that has joined the rally is its Axis Bank unit though the union also has a presence in some of the other private sector banks,” said Sanjay Lonare from Bharatiya Kamgar Sena’s Axis Bank unit.

“The lower level work in all the Axis Bank branches of the state has been hit today or taken over by regular workers. The 7,500 contract workforce in Axis Bank’s branches in Maharashtra are on strike. The contract workers here are affiliated to the Kamgar Sena,” he said.

“The condition of contractor workers is worse than animals. Salaries range between Rs13,000 to Rs17,000 a month. Though it’s difficult to make ends meet, contract workers are even denied basic rights like leave. A single day’s leave not only leads to a pay cut, but also a threat of losing the job. Women workers’ services are terminated after they return from maternity leave,” he said.

Provident fund is deducted from salaries but other terms and conditions are framed in such a way that employees are not eligible for gratuity at all. Contract workers are engaged on a three-yearly basis. Even as the same employees are continued, their services are terminated after every three years and a fresh contract has to be signed. This leads to a break in service due to which the minimum period of five years for getting gratuity is not maintained, he said.

“In June, an e-mail intimating plans to lay off 750 contract workers had left everyone worried. We hardly have any scope to get other employment. One of the workers in Nagpur also attempted suicide following the news but was saved. Finally, due to the unions’ pressure the move was withdrawn,” said a worker.

Vishal Shende said he is 33 years old and earns Rs17,000 a month. He may be better compared to many of his colleagues yet the sum is too less to meet expenses. “We have to work much beyond the regular eight hour shift yet there is no over time. With age, chances of getting another job is also reducing. I see no scope of a hike in wages,” he said.

“We do all the menial work like cleaning plates and arranging food during the staffers’ birthday celebrations but nobody bothers to even wish us on our birthdays, forget offering food,” said Lonare.

A report on the probe ordered by mayor Naveen Jain, presented in the municipal board meeting on Monday, revealed that private companies entrusted with the task of door-to-door garbage collection in the city were paid Rs 22.65 crore without verification of work done. Investigation revealed that only 10.5% garbage collection was done in 83 wards of the city.

The ZSOs who have been issued notices for lack of proper monitoring of the door-to-door garbage collection work includes Dayaram Sisodiya, Shriram Chaurasia, Surendra Singh and Mahendra Singh.

Municipal commissioner Arun Prakash said, “Notices have been issued to the environmental engineer, four ZSOs and five private companies for malpractices in the door-to-door garbage collection plan. Following response to the notices, suitable action will be taken in the entire matter. In case required, we will be taking legal action against the companies for recovery of money taken by them on the basis of fake bills.”

CHENNAI: In a bid to amp up amenities and attract more tourists to Mahabalipuram , the state government is planning to introduce a comprehensive parking space and a tram service within the tourist town.Emulating tramways in Bordeaux in France and Basel in Switzerland, which help tourists get a feel of the place on the cities’ streets, the government has proposed the plan.A centralised parking space for all tourist vehicles has been proposed. A revenue official confirmed to TOI that the department has identified a place near Karu Kathamman Temple in the beach-facing town and a proposal sent to the concerned department.Earlier, there was a proposal to create a similar space at the entrance of the town on East Coast Road. Since the move hit a roadblock due to legal issues after a lawyer moved court, revenue officials chose for an alternative site.The proposal for the parking was discussed during a meeting at the secretariat. A senior officer who attended the meeting said setting up a tram service close to the parking space was also discussed.Elaborating further, the revenue official said, “The tram will run through the town roads and narrow lanes revealing the intricate construction of the Pallava kings and artefacts of the town. This way, tourists can see the whole town without having to walk around exhaustively.”Tourists will have to get a pass to use the tram service and can hop on and off the service to see the sites at their own pace, he added. The tram would pass through the UNESCO-accredited sites of Shore Temple, the Five Rathas, Arjuna’s Penance and Krishna ’s Butterball among other places.Historians, however, are wary of the proposal, seeing it might cause potential damage to the heritage monuments . Ramachandran Nagaswamy, an Indian historian, archaeologist and epigraphist said, “First the state government should form a committee comprising officials from the concerned departments and activists, and show the route in which the tram will pass through the town.”Mahabalipuram has seen a noticeable increase in footfall since it was renovated for the second informal summit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese president Xi Jinping held on October 11 and 12 last year. Though hawkers were removed ahead of the summit, more vendors have mushroomed. Nagasamy said the appreciation of heritage sites was on the decline as such, adding, “this should not worsen the situation.”",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73166547,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1019231,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/if-plans-go-well-a-tram-may-take-you-around-mahabs/articleshow/73163846.cms

History of Octroi Post

BENGALURU: The 19th century heritage structure located in Chamarajpet, known as Bangalore Gate or octroi post , will soon regain its old glory, thanks to the city police commissioner.The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) had taken up restoration work of the dilapidated colonial structure following a Twitter appeal by top cop Bhaskar Rao.He said restoring the post has been his dream. “I have lived my life in the southern part of the city and I know the importance of the octroi post,” Rao said. After renovation, it will also house a library for police personnel, he added.The revamp is funded by heritage lovers and the primary donor is Basant Poddar, chairperson of Mineral Enterprises Ltd (MEL). “The basic cost of renovation is estimated at Rs 50 lakh. However, it may go up if we build a fountain and walking lane inside,” Poddar said.“Octroi post, which is around 80 sqm, is among the most important heritage structures in the city. We have studied its history before holding discussions with engineers on the nature of restoration work,” he said. Work will be completed by the end of January or February, he added.SK Aruni, historian and regional director of Indian Council of Historical Research, opined that the octroi post could have been a tax collection point between 1900 and 1910 — taxing people entering the city from Mysuru Road. Originally the Bengaluru-Mysuru Road started from KIMS Hospital circle in KR Market. However, as the city expanded rapidly, Mysuru Road was shifted to its present location around 1950, Aruni added.In 1830s, the road opposite KIMS Hospital was marked as the beginning of the road to Mysuru. It passed Gandhi Baazar and Girinagar before joining Mysuru Road on the border of Girinagar. However, the city was beginning to expand and residents started opting for presentday Mysuru Road. On the other hand, Chamarajpet also started to grow. Accordingly, the octroi post was constructed at Sirsi Circle as it was the borderline for then Bangalore,” he added.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73169706,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-286875,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bangalore-gate-all-set-for-makeover/articleshow/73163017.cms

Vijender Gupta

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday alleged that the ruling Aam Aadmi Party was trying to “mislead” people on the issue of providing ownership rights to the residents of unauthorised colonies by questioning the authenticity of the registration documents.

Addressing a press conference, leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly Vijender Gupta said that it was “ridiculous” that AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was raising question on the registration process of the house deeds, which was being executed by a sub-registrar under his own government.

“Kejriwal and other AAP leaders should not commit the sin of misleading the people of unauthorised colonies. The campaign of the BJP government (at the Centre) to confer ownership rights is progressing fast. Kejriwal cannot stop the registration process of land and houses in unauthorised colonies at any cost,” Gupta said.

The AAP leaders, including Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia, have questioned the exercise in unauthorised colonies and alleged that “fake” registration certificates were being given to the people.

Calling the registration process a “big fraud”, Sisodia said a property cannot be registered unless the land use for the plot was changed to residential. “The registry document clearly says that any existing law – such as the DDA Act or the Delhi Masterplan - can be enforced in these colonies. Armed with a court or an NGT order, an official can start demolition of these colonies and this paper cannot save them,” he added.

Gupta said about one lakh people had registered themselves on the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) website for ownership rights of their properties, adding, “This is because they have full faith in the BJP government.”

BJP MP from North-West Delhi Hans Raj Hans alleged that the chief minister did not want the benefits of the Centre’s schemes to reach poor people.

482,['9/01/2020'],"Delhi: JNU says over 3,000 register for new semester","This story is from January 9, 2020

Jawaharlal Nehru University

NEW DELHI: The Jawaharlal Nehru University vice-chancellor on Tuesday claimed that 3,552 out of the total 8,600 students had registered for the new semester despite the boycott call given by JNU Students Union ( JNUSU ).

JNUSU, however, dismissed the claim stating that only around 170 students had registered as two schools — languages and social sciences, which have the most students — were in complete lockdown.

Saket Moon, JNUSU vice-president, told TOI, “If you speak to most students, they will say they haven’t registered. School of Languages has close to 3,200 students and School of Social Sciences around 2,800. These are the largest schools. Someone in the office informed us that only 170 people had registered.”

To complete the registration process, students have to clear the hostel dues and pay the registration fees. Following this, they need to go to their respective departments and submit the folio signed by the guide and the head.

Registration was disrupted on January 3 when a group of students allegedly entered the server room of the university and damaged the wires. Had the registration been completed by January 5, the new semester would have started. Now, there is no clarity on what will happen to the academic calendar. Many complained that because of extension of the registration process and continuation of the stalemate, the winter semester could be disrupted.

Teachers said the solution would have been rolling back the fee hike and extending the monsoon semester by two weeks. In two weeks, the assessment and examination would have been completed. “The academic calendar has to be shifted a little further. The monsoon semester could have been extended by two weeks. The winter semester could have continued by cutting short the summer vacation. This would have ensured that the new academic year began on time. If the administration delays in resolving the issues, the university’s academic calendar will go haywire,” said JNUTA president DK Lobiyal.

Despite repeated attempts by TOI through phone calls and messages, the JNU administration didn’t respond to the queries. On Wednesday, JNUSU called for another day of strike making it the 72nd day of agitation that started as part of the protest against the hostel fee hike . Because of the strike, classes were kept on hold in many departments and centres and students did not sit for the exams.

Agra: A group consisting students and teachers of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) has moved Allahabad high court with a writ petition, seeking probe into the role of district administration, paramilitary force and varsity administration in the December 15 violence. The legal team of AMU Coordination Committee filed the writ on Tuesday.

The violence had left at least 70 people injured.

The Allahabad high court has already asked the NHRC to probe the role of police into the violence.

Asad Hayat, who is representing AMU Coordination Committee in the court, alleged that the varsity administration is working “under political pressure” and must also be held responsible for the police brutality.

“Since the university administration was not sincerely engaging with the stakeholders, it was imperative to go to court. He further added that this is being done not just to exercise the democratic rights of the students but also to protect democratic values,” he said. Hayat also tried to highlight the separate versions on the permission granted to police to enter the campus.

“The letter the police are presenting as a proof of permission to enter the campus is dated December 13 and is for security arrangements outside the administrative block, written by the Registrar. On that day, Dr Kafeel Khan along with political analyst Yogendra Yadav, were scheduled to arrive in the campus.”

“If the police had a permission of December 15, then why are they not showing it in the court?” he asked.

When contacted, Registrar of the university, Abdul Hamid, said that the district administration was asked to take steps to maintain public order in the university campus on December 15.

Aligarh DIG Akash Kulhary also claimed that they had a written permission, which has been submitted in the court. He told TOI that December 13 letter was the different one.

Twenty fishermen from Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts, who were lodged in a Karachi jail for 14 months after straying into Pakistan waters in November 2018, reached Vijayawada late on Tuesday night and met chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy on Wednesday.

“We had little hope of coming back. We are grateful to the chief minister for his efforts in securing our release,” said one of them. While 20 of the 22 fishermen have been released, the remaining two are likely to be released in the next one-two weeks, officials said.

Jagan, who announced a grant of Rs 5 lakh to each of the fishermen to restart their lives, also directed officials to expedite the construction of fishing harbours in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam. He expressed anguish after learning that more than 15,000 fishermen were travelling to Gujarat due to the absence of fishing jetties.

“It is sad to know that nearly 15,000 people are going to Gujarat to work as labour, despite AP having a vast coastline. Soon, a jetty for the fishermen will be provided in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts,” he said. He also said the state would do its best to bring back fishermen from the state who are lodged in Bangladesh jails at the earliest.

As many as 22 fishermen from Vizianagaram, Srikakulam and East Godavari districts went fishing in November 2018 and strayed into Pakistan waters. They were detained by the Pakistan coast guard, and later sent to a jail in Karachi jail.

The state government’s constant efforts with the Centre paved way for their release. Marketing and fisheries minister Mopidevi Venkata Ramana went to Wagah border to receive the fishermen after they were released by Pakistani authorities and brought them back.

Surada Kishore, 18, from Etcherla mandal in Srikakulam district, said they lost their way off Gujarat coast while fishing in the deep seas.

“We were arrested by the Pakistan coast guard and were sent to a jail in Karachi. The only communication with our families back home was through letters.

“ In jail, we were made to work very hard, especially those from India are made to work even harder. I am very happy to be back home,” he said, while adding that he would pursue his studies with the financial support extended by the chief minister.

<p>Representative image</p><p><br></p>

NAGPUR: The World Bank and Government of India have a loan agreement of $400 million to expand the coverage and quality of interventions for control of tuberculosis (TB). It also supports the government’s national strategic plan to end TB in India by 2025.

“The private sector engagement will be one of the priorities of the World Bank,” said Ronald Upenyu Mutasa, the bank’s task team leader for the TB elimination programme of South East Asia.

“World Bank supports scaling of engagement of the private sector in health services, especially for the goal of TB elimination in India. There is flexibility in the funding pattern. Private hospitals and NGOs working for the elimination of TB need to come up with concrete plans through the proper channel,” Mutasa said.

According to him, Maharashtra is one of the nine priority states in the TB mission and has a big opportunity in the next five years. He also had a word of praise for central and state governments for effective implementation of the TB eradication programme.

“The Indian government made many changes in the fund allotment rules in 2019 which makes it easier for the private sector to come forward and contribute for the cause. The government is readily giving the multi-drug resistant TB (MDR) ward if private hospital demands,” he said.

With the help of the World Bank, the government provides financial incentives to private sector care providers for reporting cases of TB and ensuring that their patients complete the treatment regimen. It also provides direct benefit transfers to patients for acquiring the critical nutrition needed during treatment. World Bank funds also help GOI to strengthen monitoring and implementation of Nikshay — a web-based TB case monitoring system.

Former deputy director general for TB control in the ministry of health and family welfare, Dr Sunil Khaparde, who now works as national adviser to the GOI on the issue, said the World Bank programme also supports the ministry of health and family welfare to develop and implement a human resource plan to meet institutional capacity needs at the Centre and state level.

Chest physician, Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, said that pulmonologists and NGOs in the city are keen to make city TB free for which they will prepare implementable plans now. “Dr Ronald Mutasa has given a very positive message to people from the private sector willing to work for elimination of TB. We will adhere to the established protocol,” he said.

On Tuesday,deputy speaker Jayaraman, during his speech in the assembly, reiterated the demand to make Pollachi... Read More

COIMBATORE: A day after deputy speaker Jayaraman reiterated the demand to make Pollachi a separate district, stakeholders are divided in their opinions on the issue. While industrialists and traders believe that the move would help improve the economy of the largely agricultural region, farmers are of the opinion that Pollachi does not have enough industries or revenues to sustain itself as a district.

On Tuesday, the deputy speaker, during his speech in the assembly, demanded that Pollachi be made a separate district. He said Pollachi was a revenue block from 1857 when Tirupur was just a firka. “Pollachi along with Madathukulam, Valparai and Udumalpet should be carved into a separate district,” he said.

Industrialists and traders echoed Jayaraman’s demand arguing that this administrative move was crucial to realise the growth potential of the region. “Pollachi, which is dominated by agricultural economy and lands, needs a lot more agriculture-based industries to see fast growth. It will also help in development of tourism. The move will help increase per capita income,” said vice-president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries and educationist S Venkkatesh. “Now people must keep travelling to Coimbatore to get every permission and make policy decision regarding our region.”

Secretary of the Pollachi Small Scale Traders Association A Harikrishnan agreed that constantly having to travel to Coimbatore to get permissions for new industries, explain situations and demand policy changes or even sort out tax issues is becoming difficult for them. “Even to get a licence for a trivial matter like operating a cracker shop, we need to travel all the way there,” he said.

“We also believe that if Pollachi were to be a separate district, it will bring more attention to the region which will increase land value,” he added.

However, farmers believe that it is better for the region to stay with Coimbatore. “Unlike Tirupur that has a large garment industry, Pollachi has no major industry except coir, which is comparatively very small. We don’t have a large enough industrial economy or revenue system to sustain as a separate district,” said coconut farmer K Jothimani.

HYDERABAD: With both supporters and opponents of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) carrying the Tricolour during their rallies, suppliers of the National Flag have for the first time run out of stock ahead of Republic Day.The anti-CAA rally on January 4, which saw thousands taking to the streets in Hyderabad, shrunk the stock further. Retailers sold an estimated 3.5 lakh national flags for the rally, among the biggest non-violent gatherings for a cause in Hyderabad in six decades. In fact, flag sellers have sought fresh stocks from manufacturers, who are working overtime to meet the huge demand.Suppliers say Hyderabad is likely to see a further spurt in the demand in next two days as Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM has proposed a mega rally from Mir Alam Idgah to Shastripuram in the city outskirts on January 10. Owaisi, who announced that he would hoist the National Flag at Charminar on the Republic Day, has ordered a 10 feet by 30 feet Tricolour.“Generally, demand for the National Flag goes up before Republic Day and Independence Day. But the last fortnight has seen huge demand across the country. Retailers in Delhi are calling us to enquire if we can arrange fresh supplies,” said flag bulk manufacturer Mahendar Reddy of Vidy Arts Flags at Nagole in the city.Shaik Osman of SK Group, a bulk manufacturer at Mailardevpally, told TOI that the flag market in Osmangunj had virtually run out of stock. Retailers have now placed orders to meet the demand for Republic Day. “We have hired extra workers to stitch flags. On January 3 and 4, retailers had jacked up prices. A 20x30 inch flag, normally sold for Rs 15, was sold for Rs 30 while 30x45 inch flag was sold for Rs 50 as against Rs 30 on other days,” he said.

NEW DELHI: The government has ruled out an immediate cut in taxes on petrol and diesel to soften the impact of the geo-political tensions, which have triggered a spike in global crude oil prices .Brent prices crossed the $71-a-barrel mark early Wednesday morning after Iran launched a missile attack , but softened later in the day. Since last year, Brent prices have jumped nearly 15% and were trading around $68 a barrel.Over the past year, the increase in pump prices of diesel and petrol has been around 10%. ""There is no need to panic,"" said a high-ranking government source, adding that prices had softened a little after a spike due to Qassem Suleimani's killing last week but rose again after Iran fired missiles at American bases in Iraq on Wednesday.Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters that the government is keeping a close watch on the developing geo-political situation, while also preparing itself to face any eventuality arising out of the crisis. Pradhan has had detailed discussions with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who has spoken to his counterparts in oil-producing countries stating India's concerns.A sharp rise in oil prices has the potential to adversely impact the Indian economy with inflation facing the first round of impact. An increase of $10 a barrel in crude prices affects inflation by a 0.1 percentage point. With India importing 80% of its crude requirement, the rupee also comes under pressure due to a higher import bill. This, in turn, affects the trade balance and current account deficit.During 2018-19, India's oil import bill was estimated at $140 billion. Both retail and wholesale inflation have shown a rising trend on the back of high food prices and any increase in oil prices could stoke inflation at a time when growth is estimated at an 11-year low of 5%.Besides, a reduction in duties will impact the already strained government finances, especially when net tax revenue has gone up by 2.6% against a budgeted 11% increase (after transfer to states).",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73168207,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-340256,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-duty-cuts-to-soften-fuel-spike/articleshow/73164426.cms

(File photo)

NEW DELHI: SBICAP Ventures , which has been entrusted with the task of managing the proposed Rs 25,000-crore real estate stressed asset fund, cleared the first batch of four applications, lending Rs 25 crore each to the realtors.

The fund was created by the government with contributions from financial institutions such as LIC and SBI to complete over 1,600 stalled projects with 4.5 lakh dwelling units.

According to a banking source, more than 100 proposals have already been submitted to SBICAP Ventures by December 31. A source said that seeing the urgency of the matter, banks are working overtime to clear the applications.

SBICAP Ventures has fixed the lending rate at 15% and is lending with a condition that it will have first charge on the future receivables of the company.

Though the fund is lending to a project as the last option, it will be the first one to get its money back when the inflow will start, that is, with the condition of last-in, first-out (LIFO).

Commenting on interest rates, Hiranandani Group CMD Niranjan Hirnandani said though it is a bit on the higher side, at least the fund is made available. So, it is a welcome move. ""The sector is facing a tough time because of acute liquidity crunch. So, in this market, cost does not matter much,"" he said.

Delhi-based Supertech has also applied for a Rs 1,200-crore loan from the fund for its various projects in Noida and Greater Noida. R K Arora, Supertech CMD, said that due diligence of all the projects is going on and hoped that approvals are likely to come in this month itself. SBICAP Ventures took charge of the fund in November only and asked for proposals from various developers and managers of stalled projects.

NEW DELHI: China's TCL, one of the world's biggest television makers, has decided to make its upcoming Tirupati factory a global manufacturing hub as it plans to export the India-made TVs to the US.The move comes amid trade tensions between the US and China, which has prompted many Chinese companies to develop fresh manufacturing locations outside their home turf to dodge US business sanctions and adverse duties.Mike Chen, India country manager for TCL, said that the Chinese company - which is the top TV seller in the US and a strong player in markets such as France and Australia - has plans to increasingly use its India factory for meeting demand in global markets.""The manufacturing costs in India are very attractive, and are even cheaper than what we incur in China. The cheaper labour cost here is one of the reasons behind the low costing,"" Chen told TOI.The company currently sources TVs in India from local contract manufacturers (the high-end ones are imported from China), but will gradually start making them at its own factory which will start production from the middle of this year. ""We have invested around Rs 2,200 crore for the facility, and capacities here are higher considering that it will be used for meeting demand in other countries too.""While the company sold around 1 million TVs in India last year, the installed capacity at the Tirupati plant is for 6 million panels annually and 3 million through assembly operations.The government has been taking steps to encourage electronics manufacturing in India, and counts the recent cuts in corporate tax rates among the boosters. ""We want India to be a strong manufacturing hub for electronics, and for telecom equipment,"" electronics and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said recently.TCL had re-entered India in 2016 after having quit the market over not-so-healthy operations. After launching TVs here, the company has now started sales of air-conditioners. Chen said that going forward, the company plans to become a full-product seller of consumer electronics by getting into categories such as washing machines, and refrigerators. He said that India is one of the critical markets for TCL, especially when it comes to the sales of TVs.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73167310,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-258821,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/chinas-tcl-to-feed-us-make-in-india-tvs/articleshow/73164451.cms

(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Wednesday approved the strategic disinvestment of equity shareholding of Minerals & Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), MECON, Bharat Heavy Electricals (Bhel) and two Odisha state government PSUs in Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL) to a strategic buyer.

The buyer is to be identified through a two-stage auction procedure.

MMTC holds 49.8%, NMDC 10.1%, MECON 0.7% and Bharat Heavy Electricals (Bhel) 0.7% in Neelachal Ispat Nigam. Two Odisha state government PSUs, which include Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation of Odisha (IPICOL) 12% and Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC) 20.5%, are also part of the joint venture firm.

NINL is a joint venture company, in which four central public sector enterprises MMTC, NMDC, Bhel and MECON, and two Odisha state government PSUs - IPICOL and OMC - are shareholders.

The proposed strategic disinvestment of NINL would unlock resources to be used to finance the social sector and developmental programmes of the government.

It is also expected that the successful strategic buyer may bring in new management, technology, investment for the growth of the company and may use innovative methods for the development of the business operations of the company, which may generate more employment opportunities.

The government has set an ambitious target of raising Rs 1.05 lakh crore from stake sale in state-run companies in the current fiscal year but has raised only Rs 17,364.3 crore . It has plans to undertake strategic sales in a clutch of companies including energy company BPCL , which is expected to raise up to Rs 80,000 crore but the progress on this has been slow.

NEW DELHI: Telecom major Bharti Airtel on Wednesday said it has opened a qualified institutions placement process to raise $2 billion and has launched FCCBs worth up to $1 billion. For the QIP issue, the special committee of directors has fixed a floor price of Rs 452 per share.

It added that the floor price of Rs 452 per equity share in respect of the issue is based on the pricing formula according to Sebi rules . In a BSE filing, it said the committee may, at its absolute discretion, offer a discount of not more than 5% on the floor price.

Besides, the company has also launched foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) at a regulatory floor price of Rs 452 to raise an aggregate amount of up to $1 billion, the filing said.

Earlier this month, shareholders of Bharti Airtel had approved proposals to raise up to $2 billion in equity and another $1 billion in debt.

The proposal for issuance of securities for amount up to $2 billion, and issue of foreign currency convertible bonds and unsecured/secured redeemable non-convertible debentures along with or without warrants was passed at the company's EGM on January 3.

Airtel is expected to use the funds to pay the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) liability and invest in the network.

496,['9/01/2020'],Maharashtra Zilla Parishad Election Results: BJP loses zilla parishad in Nitin Gadkari and Fadnavis' home turf,"This story is from January 9, 2020

MUMBAI: In a jolt to former CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari , both of whom are from Nagpur, BJP has suffered a defeat in the Nagpur zilla parishad polls, results of which were announced on Wednesday.

Of six zilla parishads in Maharashtra for which elections were held on Tuesday - the first since the NCP-Cong-Shiv Sena coalition came to power - the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi won 4. The Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi retained control over one (Akola) while BJP wrested one (Dhule) from Congress.

Three of the four zilla parishads won by the MVA - Nagpur, Palghar and Washim - were earlier with BJP; the fourth, Nandurbar, was with Congress.

BJP, however, emerged as the party with the maximum number of seats. Of the total 332 seats, it won 103 (as against 74 in the 2013 polls), while the Congress tally dropped from 100 to 73 and NCP's from 53 to 46. Sena's numbers rose from 36 in 2013 to 46.

BJP loses in Gadkari’s & ex-mantri’s villages

BJP was tied with the ruling Congress at 23 seats in Nandurbar, where Congress has traditionally been strong, but lost out due to the MVA alliance. Contesting the polls together in a pre-poll pact against BJP helped the ruling coalition secure a win big.

In the Nagpur ZP, BJP nominees lost to Congress candidates from Dhapewada and Kamptee, the villages of Gadkari and former energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule. Both Gadkari and Fadnavis had campaigned extensively in the entire district. BJP won 15 seats as against 22 in 2013 while Congress 30 as against 19 earlier, NCP 10 compared to 7 earlier, and Sena 1, when it had won 8 earlier.

Salil Deshmukh, son of home minister Anil Deshmukh, won the zilla parishad election from hometown Katol, represented by his father in the state assembly.

State NCP president and water resources minister Jayant Patil said the results showed this was the beginning of the downfall of BJP. ""It's time for Fadnavis and Gadkari for self-introspection. Not only people of Nagpur, but elsewhere in the state too, people have rejected BJP,"" Patil said.

State Congress president Balasaheb Thorat had taken the lead in contesting the ZP elections under the MVA banner and had set up a coordination committee under Sena's Aaditya Thackeray. ""The outcome of the zilla parishad elections shows people have lost faith in BJP,"" Thorat said.

497,['9/01/2020'],"Nagpur: 9.84% drop in road accidents, but fatalities up 4.8% in 2019","This story is from January 9, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: Road accidents in Nagpur declined by 9.84% in 2019 but saw a 4.8% rise in fatalities, according to data compiled by Nagpur city traffic police.

In 2019, the city witnessed 1,007 road accidents that left 250 dead and 1,042 injured, the data revealed. It means around three road accidents were reported every day. There was a decline in road accidents by almost 110, whereas the figure was 1,117 in 2018.

The rise in the number of fatal accidents continues to be a cause for concern. When it comes to the number of deaths, there is a rise (4.8%) from 238 in 2018 to 250 in 2019.

The city has roads spread over 2201.19km. They come under different agencies like the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT), NHAI and the state’s public works department (PWD). The national highways, which constitute just 1.35% of the total road network in the jurisdiction of Nagpur police commissionerate, account for 23% of the accidents. State highways and PWD roads, which have a length of 91.13km, witnessed 76 accidents. The 2,080.26km of roads under NMC and NIT are more accident prone.

Of the 1,007 accidents, statistics revealed that the internal and inner ring road recorded the maximum road accidents at 619 and 76 respectively followed by Amravati Road (56), Jabalpur Road (47), Wardha Road (47), Chhindwara Road (45) and Bhandara Road (41).

A combination of factors such as human error, irresponsible driving and lack of traffic sense is raising the level of human vulnerability to accidents. In most cases, the driver was found to be at fault, because of over-speeding or jumping the signal, wrong side driving or under the influence of alcohol.

Of the 1007 road accidents, four-wheeler drivers topped the list with 316 cases followed by two-wheelers (274), trucks (171) and autorickshaws (41).

An official from the office of the deputy commissioner of police (traffic) attributed the decline in the number of accidents to the awareness drives they have been conducting, year in and year out.

The traffic police focused on various safety measures and enforcement drives. It reflected in the number of cases registered. Compared to 2018, the number of cases increased by 47%, from 3.16 lakh in 2018 to 4.55 lakh in 2019, resulting in the decline in road accidents.

The officer said initiatives like creating traffic awareness, taking corrective measures after identifying black spots coupled with extensive enforcement drives to impose fines and booking drunk drivers yielded good results.

Traffic experts, however, disagree. They say work pertaining to roads, flyovers and metro slowed down traffic and hence, the number of accidents came down. “The rise in the number of penalized traffic violators have had zero impact on roads because the driving habits of Nagpurians have not changed,” they said.

498,['9/01/2020'],Nagpur: Last-minute change in standards for making latest grenades raises questions,"This story is from January 9, 2020

NAGPUR: A last-minute change in standards for making the latest multimodal hand grenades that are set to replace the World War II era M36 grenades used by the Indian Army has raised questions. The new grenades will be made by Ordnance Factory Khamaria (OFK) and a private sector entity from Nagpur.

Nagpur’s Economic Explosives Limited (EEL) has emerged as the sole qualifying private company to bid for the hand grenade contract. Request for Proposal (RFP), the document inviting bids, has been issued to EEL as the sole qualifier.

The key parameter in a hand grenades’ functioning is the timing of explosion. A specific timing has to be fixed for the grenade to blow up after its pin is pulled. For the multimodal grenades, it has to be not before 3.5 seconds and not later than 4.5 seconds.

After the RFP was issued, an amendment was made allowing leeway for 10% of the production batch. No 5% of the grenades can have a timing between 3.5 and 4.75 seconds and another 5% can have timing between 3.5 and 5 seconds. This happened around August this year following a meeting to discuss the project in the ministry of defence, said a source.

The initial delay is needed to ensure the grenade does not blow up in soldier’s hand but it should also not give the enemy enough time to throw it back. A leeway for 10% of the production batch comes as a surprise, said sources involved in the development of the weapon.

Both EEL and the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) officials denied asking for any relaxation. Both sides said they had already achieved over 99% accuracy in maintaining the 3.5 to 4.5 seconds bandwidth during trials so there was no question of them asking for easing the norms.

Representatives of EEL management showed TOI a trial report that read the grenade made by the company had achieved more than 99% accuracy. A company official accepted there was a subsequent change in requirements.

OFB officials maintained no change in requirement has been intimated to them. This is because OFB will not be getting an order through RFP. An indent will be placed directly by the army to them. OFK will stick to the 3.5 to 4.5 timing, said an OFB official.

“Had the concession been allowed earlier, OFB would have been able to start making grenades in 2012 itself as it was already developed but perfect timings could not be achieved. The project started in 2005 and it took over a decade for the OFB to achieve the timing. Now relaxation for even 10% of the batch is no longer needed,” said an OFB official. EEL came into the picture in 2015, even as OFB was working on the project much earlier, the source said.

OFB has fired a couple of thousand rounds during the trials after which the product was cleared. Even after clearing the timings test, questions were raised about the ring on the grenade by which it is fixed to hold it by the finger. A clarification was needed on the material used for making the ring. There was another query related to rust seen on a joint. With all questions answered, OFB is now waiting for the army to issue production order. For the private sector, RFP process will continue.
