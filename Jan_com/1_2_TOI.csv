1,['2/01/2020'],"Go clean and green in 2020, say no to toxic beauty products","The year 2019 witnessed conversations and discussions around what we consume and how it affects the environment and what’s sustainable and what’s not. Surprisingly, these conversations were not just restricted to food and clothing, but also took over the beauty and cosmetics industry. The term ‘clean beauty’ took center stage. Here’s everything you should know about the buzzword.As the term suggests, clean beauty refers to products that are mindfully created and produced without any proven or suspected toxic ingredients. Most of the products curated and created are said to have been sourced ethically and do not have side effects on your skin and the environment. “It is all about using the original source in its natural form and using that to the best of its capacity,” says Rubeina Karachiwalla, a beauty entrepreneur.Dermatologist and aesthetician Dr Anil Abraham says, “Patients have been wanting to know more about the trend and its benefits. As doctors, we are realising that it’s not a fad and is going to be the direction that skincare and health are going to take.” Deep Lalvani, a clean beauty curator, explains, “Increased exposure to pollution, stress and toxins in skincare has resulted in a more sensitive skin. Hence, this is building a stronger case towards clean beauty products.”“Products impact the environment through two main components — the product itself and product packaging. Product packaging includes several components that negatively impact the environment, namely plastic. A clean beauty approach focuses on sustainable packaging, recycling and using a supply chain that reduces carbon footprint,” says Deep. “Clean and green beauty should go hand-in-hand. The consumer must take their power back by demanding clean beauty products with sustainable packaging,” he adds.Experts advise that one should exercise caution and not follow a label that says ‘clean’. “There is a risk that these labels — natural, organic, preservative-free — may not actually be reflected in the contents of the product. It could be a clever marketing ploy to sell more expensive products to niche consumers who are aware of environmental damage,” says Dr Anil. “Some times, manufacturers use cheaper substitutes for natural materials and claim that it is clean, natural or vegan. Hence, consumers need to be informed and educate about the ingredients that are being used in products,” says Rubeina. Desiree Pereira, owner of a clean beauty line adds, “Manufacturers may use ingredients that may actually be worse than the ingredients they are trying to avoid in order to meet the ‘organic or natural’ criteria, and get similarefficacy. I would advise people to not go by labels, especially if they are not sure about how some of them can bemisleading.”For those who think clean beauty is the answer to glowing skin, experts advise otherwise. “A healthy lifestyle is the best beauty care. It is best to avoid harsh treatments and products on the skin. Products need to be genuine and manufacturers should ensure that the labels are not misleading and are within the reach of the common consumer in terms of price,” sums up Dr Anil.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73057476,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-954697/73057476.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/beauty/go-clean-and-green-in-2020-say-no-to-toxic-beauty-products/articleshow/73057476.cms

5,['2/01/2020'],"Mayakkum Margazhi: I usually don’t go past 5 minutes for an RTP, says Mahathi","Performing a Ragam Tanam Pallavi (RTP) is an essential part of most Carnatic concerts, but there’s no denying that its inclusion increases the duration of the performance. Holding the audience’s attention and making them connect with the verses are some of the challenges artistes face. That’s one of the reasons why Mahathi S has chosen to do RTPs differently this year. The singer has been choosing general topics that relate to the audience for this segment.“Until last year, my RTPs were about God, but this year, I’ve been trying to sing on general subjects as well,” says Mahathi, “Usually in kutcheris, the songs are all about a particular God or a spiritual element. So, I decided to take up general subjects, like flowers, animals, Tamizh and Thirukkural, which Sanjay sir (Sanjay Subrahmanyan) generally does. For instance, one of my pallavis was —Kattravarai rasikka vaipathu kalaiya, rasiganai karka vaipathum kalaiye. It was in the ragam Rasali. Another one was, aanam pola vaazhkai undu, vaazhndu parka vaa, padi aadi maghizha, in ragam Shanmukhapriya. I usually don’t go beyond 25 minutes for an RTP and try to keep it energetic by choosing brisk ragams. This year, there have been a few occasions when we, as artistes, clapped for our audience from the stage because they have been attentive and sat for the entire duration. I think this kind of appreciative gestures help build relationships.”It has been 18 years since Mahathi started performing during the Margazhi season. Reminiscing about her first concert, she says, “In 2001, I performed for Karthik Fine Arts, at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Mini Hall for an audience of 20. But long ago, when I was three-and-a-half-years old, I had once sung during the season. In that sense, my first Margazhi concert was on December 25, 1988. Though my dad is from Thiruvaiyaru, he worked in a private company in Kerala, and I spent my childhood there.”Mahathi continues, “So, every December, he’d bring me to Chennai so that I could attend concerts. It was Mandolin Shrinivas sir’s kutcheri at Mylapore Fine Arts. I was sitting on my mother’s lap and was loudly blurting out the ragas in which he was performing. When he started Madhyamavathi, I said the concert was over. Those who were seated next to my mom were quite surprised. They insisted that I do a live demo after Shrinivas sir finished his concert. The sabha secretary, Venkatraman mama, arranged for it, and my mom coaxed me to get on the dais. Shrinivas sir and Kanyakumari amma (A Kanyakumari, violinist) were on stage, playing different ragas, and I was spelling out the ragas using a stage mic. That was such a big exposure for me.”Coming from a family of musicians, it was but natural for Mahathi to develop a deep passion for the performing arts. “My appa (Thiruvaiyaru P Sekar) is a disciple of Balamurali sir and my mom is a flautist. My great grandfather, Pazhamaneri Swaminatha Iyer, is the fourth Sangita Kalanidhi of Madras Music Academy. Our house in Thiruvaiyaru is a stone’s throw away from Thyagaraja’s sannidhi. So, I was heavily influenced by music in my growing up years,” she says.But why did it take her so many years to perform during Margazhi? “That’s because I was based out of Kerala, where I was doing my schooling. It was actually after I got an opportunity to sing for Ilaiyaraaja sir that I shifted to Chennai. I sang for him during my Class 11 vacation and shifted to Chennai for my next academic year. In a way, it was because of my playback singing career that I could perform during Margazhi,” she states.But the singer admits her career in films also stopped people from taking her seriously as a classical musician. “I had big hits as a playback singer till 2011. During those few years, people thought I was taking Carnatic music lightly, even though I wasn’t. The problem is, if you appear on a TV show, people think you are more into light music. Even if you maintain your film and Carnatic music career separately, it’s difficult to change this mindset of people.”But now that she’s established herself as a Carnatic musician as well, is there any advice that she’d like to give aspiring Carnatic musicians? “It takes a lot of preparation to sing during Margazhi. I was 17 when I gave my first Margazhi concert, and I remember how much of planning I did to finalise the ragam and kalpanaswaram. When we start, we by-heart a lot of stuff, and are not very confident about going extempore on stage. We try to render whatever we have practised to near perfection. If we forget even one swaram, then the flow completely stops. But as you evolve, you stop rehearsing. You gain confidence as you perform. The other problem that we generally face is with our voice — we don’t know how to manage our voice and get stressed out. We learn that too as we grow. But beyond all that, I think it’s also a sheer blessing to be able to perform well on stage. There are times when you have gone over a song a thousand times, but it will not work out that day. That’s the superpower controlling you.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73057687,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-675082/73057687.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/mayakkum-margazhi-i-usually-dont-go-past-5-minutes-for-an-rtp-says-mahathi/articleshow/73057687.cms

8,['2/01/2020'],2020 is going to be all about pop revolution and indie music: Akasa,"Akasa had a whirlwind 2019 with her songs being played at music festivals in Mauritius, the singer collaborating with international artistes like Lauv and her track Naagin becoming a chartbuster. She was recently in Bengaluru for a performance. In a quick chat with us, Akasa spoke about her work with Ricky Martin, how Thug Ranjha propelled her into the music industry, how she believes in being authentic and more, Excerpts:It was a great year. In fact, the last few months of 2019 were more eventful for me than ever. Thug Ranjha was a really good start to my career, then there was a brief gap before my next project. Meanwhile, I had also been dubbing for film songs, but two of the songs that I sang last November were included in films only recently. But, overall, yes it has been an eventful year for me.Ricky and I are managed by the same music label. The team behind the label told me that he was looking for an Indian voice for his track, Vente Pa Ca, and they asked if I would like to go for it. So, I just dubbed the scratch vocals and sent it across, and the next thing I know is that I was in the song. Even my latest track, Dil Naa Janeya, was scratch vocals. But I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the final track recently. In my head, I was only hoping for it to work out well. But it not only worked out, it also had someone like Lauv being part of it.I don’t think reality shows help everybody, because, right now, there are so many of them. But it definitely helped me. It gave me a push and that is how I bagged the song, Tu Kheech Meri Photo. Even though, I was only a small part of it, it gave me an identity. It was the only thing I had to my credit for a long time. Reality shows give you a platform to reach out to a wider audience. But only a few lucky ones go viral. It’s a platform that prepares you for what you will experience once you enter the industry.Being versatile and doing things that others probably struggle to do helps. I have worked really hard on my dancing skills and my fitness, which, in turn, helped me be the face of Thug Ranjha, and not just the voice behind it. I saw my father, Arvinder Singh, on stage and the kind of fan following he had, and I wanted the same. The ‘popstar’ aura that Beyoncé has created around herself is a true inspiration. Being authentic helps you stand out from the rest.Absolutely. I feel the ’90s were cool, because pop music was above Bollywood at that time. If you compare KK or Lucky Ali’s fan following at that time, it was way more than that of a playback singer. Thankfully, it’s making a comeback. Everyone is receiving singles very well, so much so that many tracks are now being used in films as well. I feel the pop revolution is here, and 2020 will be all about indie music.I’m one of the least trained singers in my family. As a child, I was taught the basics of classical music. But since my father is a singer, I think I’ve got his genes and I’m making use if that to the fullest. Learning classical music helps you so much. If you learn the base of classical music, your voice gets so well rounded that you can sing anything. My brother is a good example of that. Woh English gaane sun sun ke shayad mujhe gaana nahi aata.I’m at a point now where I would love to work with anyone and everyone. So far, I’ve dubbed for many music composers, but there’s no one who I don’t want to work with. Collaborating with AR Rahman, however, would be a dream come true. I have also been obsessed with Diljit Dosanj and hope that I would get to work with him too in the near future.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73056992,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-165831/73056992.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/2020-is-going-to-be-all-about-pop-revolution-and-indie-music-akasa/articleshow/73057070.cms

Alfred Hitchcock had made a film called Rope, which people acknowledge as a single-shot film. But he had shot the film by brilliantly blending to make it look like one.

10,['2/01/2020'],"My Favourite Raga: One raga I have circled back to often is Begada, says Rithvik Raja","As musicians, we learn new compositions and we keep exploring different ragas. There are different periods during which we lean towards one raga. In 10 concerts, a raga might be featured five or six times invariably. Then, once that phase passes, you probably will not hear it in the next 15 or 20 concerts. And then, it will pop back. That, I think, is the beauty of the options that are available wide and plenty. All of them have amazing scope for exploration.One raga I have circled back to often is Begada. In fact, when I was around 12 years old, I remember telling my friends that one thing I wanted to probably learn was every composition in Begada. That raga continues to fascinate me. Incidentally, in my concert this Monday, that was the raga I sang as the main piece.If someone put a gun to my head and said I had to pick one raga, it would be Begada. The melody of this raga is stuck in my head. I remember hanging around my mother’s classes with her teacher as a toddler. Her teacher made her learn one line in this raga over and over again across three or four classes. That was the one line I kept hearing. She was also my teacher between 2000 and 2003.

SHIMLA: The month gone by, December, was the coldest during day time in Shimla in the last two decades. Average monthly minimum temperature in Shimla during December was 3.8 degrees Celsius, which was the second lowest average minimum temperature after 1997, when it was 3.1 degrees Celsius.

Meanwhile, there appears no immediate relief from freezing cold in Himachal Pradesh as cold conditions have intensified and the meteorological department has predicted chances of snow from January 2 to 4.

Shimla meteorological centre director Manmohan Singh said that total monthly snowfall in December in Shimla was recorded as 20.3 cm, after 2014 when it was 38.1 cm. Even, average monthly maximum temperature of Shimla during December was 13.4 degrees Celsius, which is the lowest average maximum temperature in the last 20 years. The lowest maximum average temperature was 10.5 degrees Celsius in 1986. He said Keylong in Lahaul-Spiti district recorded the lowest minus 16.4 degrees Celsius on December 17, which was the lowest minimum temperature since 2009, when minus 13.2 degrees Celsius was recorded on December 25. Monthly average minimum temperature recorded in Keylong was minus 9.9 degrees Celsius, which was the lowest monthly temperature after 2009 when minus 8.4 degrees Celsius was recorded.

The met centre director said that November and December months last year were colder at few places in Himachal Pradesh as compared to last few years. He said that there were four spells of precipitation in November and one significant spell in the December last year. He said that period from October 1 to December 31 is known as ""Post-monsoon season"" or ""North-east Monsoon Season"" and during this period overall precipitation over the state was 33% above normal.

He said this was highest precipitation in Himachal Pradesh since 2004. Previous highest precipitation was 5% above normal during Post-Monsoon Season in 2004. On account of three spells of rainfall and snowfall in November last year and one significant spell of precipitation in December, both day temperature and night were below normal.

Rain and snow has been predicted for tourist town of Shimla for Thursday and Friday. On Saturday, hill town is likely to receive light rain and snow but after that moderate rain and snow has been predicted for Monday and Tuesday.

16,['2/01/2020'],"Sitting pretty on top, will this new year be a happy one for FC Goa?","This story is from January 2, 2020

Panaji: Not that FC Goa haven’t been here before, but this time around, there is added pressure.

Goa finished the last year and the first leg at the top of the Indian Super League table. That doesn’t mean much; all that matters is how they will end. Finishing in the top four and then going on to win their first ISL title, and a purse of Rs 8 crore, would be fine with plenty of fans. But for a club that aims to make a name for itself at the continental level, the joy of finishing at the top of the table and booking a rare spot – the first for anyone from India – in the AFC Champions League (ACL) should be unmatched.

Can Goa hold on to the top spot? Of course, they can. Will it be easy? No chance.

Whether Goa are ready for the big challenge should be known when they take on the might of Bengaluru FC in their next game on Friday. The defending champions are five points behind and have been unexpectedly sluggish all through the season. They have won only four of their 10 games and scored just 11 goals, the least among the top six teams. Yet, Goa will still dread a side they have always found too hot to handle.

Sergio Lobera’s boys have won just once against Bengaluru, and that came in 2017. In all other matches, they have been second best, including last season’s final. In fact, the last time Goa visited the Sree Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru, the hosts won 3-0, despite having Nishu Kumar sent off and playing an astonishing 50 minutes with a numerical disadvantage.

Should Goa get the better of Bengaluru, they will open an eight-point gap between the two favourites. That should prove to be a major boost, although given the nature of the league, nothing can be taken for granted.

Goa are without coach Lobera for the Bengaluru clash. His assistant and most trusted hand, assistant coach Jesus Tato, will be calling the shots from the sidelines.

“You can see that we have a very strong defence, have quick wingers who have great quality and Coro in front. This makes our squad very strong. We also have other players on the bench who are waiting for an opportunity. All of them possess enough quality and skills to make the starting XI. We are very lucky to have these players with us,” said Tato.

Tato will need all of them to punch above their weight against Bengaluru.

Lobera will return for the home clash against NorthEast United on January 8, but there are fears that it may be time for some Goa players to watch from the sidelines. With five players now on three yellow cards -- Ahmed Jahouh, Edu Bedia, Brandon Fernandes, Seriton Fernandes and Lenny Rodrigues – they are in danger of missing a game, if they pick up another booking.

Then there are some really difficult games. Goa still have to play three of the top five teams away. ATK, Jamshedpur FC and even Odisha FC will make it hard, but first Goa must show they mean business against Bengaluru.

Representative image

YAMUNANAGAR: A fourmember team of the Maharashtra Police took the custody of the woman, who had been rescued from the clutches of a human trafficking gang from Yamunanagar last week. The victim, who belonged to Chandrapur district , had been kidnapped when she was just 13 years old from a temple in Ram Nagar in 2010. She will meet her family after nine years.

The police team under sub-inspector Pradeep Nitavane from Ram Nagar police station of Chandrapur district got her custody and left for Maharashtra on Wednesday morning.

During the years that she spent in captivity, the woman was gang-raped, sold, married, raped, and even gave birth to two children in Fatehabad district , where she lived for around seven years with one Dharamvir.

The woman was rescued with the efforts of a Yamunanagar-based NGO when she disclosed her ordeals to one of its members last week. Afterwards, the NGO approached the Yamunanagar women police station (PS), which registered a zero FIR on the complaint of the survivor and transferred the case to the Ram Nagar police station of Chandrapur district.

“Maharashtra Police took the custody of the woman and took her along,” inspector Seema, in charge of Yamunanagar women police station, said. “She will be able to meet her mother once we reach Maharashtra. Meanwhile, her cousin brother and uncle met us in New Delhi on Wednesday and they have identified her,” said SI Nitavane.

Nitavane said, “In 2010, she was kidnapped from Ram Nagar police station area and her family members had lost hope of finding her again. Thanks to the NGO and social activists, who made efforts to report the case to the police station, the woman will finally reunite with her mother after nine long years.”

‘Adopt, don’t shop’

Braving a record breaking winter, Delhi’s furry friends came out in their best attires as India’s biggest pet festival, Pet Fed, was back for its sixth edition at Okhla NSIC ground. With dedicated play areas for pets and food and drinks stalls for pet parents, the two-day event was a treat for everyone.The carnival featured a number of events, such as Temptation Alley, Pet Cosplay, International Cat Show, Pet’s Got Talent and, of course, the crowd favourite – Pet Fashion Show. Pet parent Shruti Mittal, who came with her pug buddy Rocky to the event, said, “This is my first time here and it feels amazing. My pet is a little scared as it is his first time also but I am loving this initiative. There are not a lot of places for pets to socialise. I know of only one pet-friendly cafe.”A police dog show organised in association with Delhi Police crime dog squad saw 10 talented police dogs perform various tasks, such as sniffing out hidden suspicious objects. In a bid to expand further and make this edition stand out from the previous ones, the International Cat Show was also held in association with the World Cat Federation . “Many people attending the previous editions had pointed out that cats get left out with so many dogs being here. That’s why we have arranged for the International Cat Show this year,” said Akshay Gupta, founder of Pet Fed. International experts were present at the show to guide pet parents on how to take care of their cats.While the pet talent show saw a lot of skilled pets, like a singing husky and a paneer-catching Dalmatian, many four-legged buddies felt too lazy to perform due to the evening chill. The fashion show saw a lot of unique participants. Some pooches dressed up as cowboys and minions, others went traditional and set the ramp on fire in dhoti and kurta . From India’s most followed cat on Instagram to a chow chow dog with 1,054 followers on social media, pet celebs stole the show as pet lovers queued up to click photos with them.Raising awareness among pet lovers to adopt indigenous dogs instead of shopping for exotic breeds was one of the initiatives taken up at the event. To encourage the same, desi pets were allowed free entry. Animal rights activist Ambika Shukla, who was also one of the judges of the fashion show, urged the audience to adopt desi dogs instead of an exotic one. “If you want a pet, adopt an Indian dog. Every shelter is overloaded with dogs. You would be getting a best friend for free,” she said.-- Imana.Bhattacharya@timesgroup.comIn Video: Delhi's furry friends have a paw-some time at Pet Fed 2-019",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73057422,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-132645,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pets-have-a-purr-fect-time-at-this-fest/articleshow/73057384.cms

But when the two came to town to promote their upcoming film, ' Sab Kushal Mangal ', they simply couldn’t resist pausing in the neighbourhood to experience the Delhi winter. “I am freezing,” said Priyaank Sharma as he walked on the streets of Delhi on the cold winter morning. Talking about his Delhi connection, he shared, “It’s not the first time that I am here. In fact, I have a family in Sainik Farms and I have come to Delhi after three years. I used to roam around GK 1 and GK 2 and would often go on long drives with my friends. I have partied a lot in south Delhi and that’s a very comfortable setting for me.”For Riva, too, coming to Delhi is not new. She told us, “Since my dad ( Ravi Kishan ) is now a politician, mera Dilli aana laga hi rehta hai. Pehle itna zyada nahi hota tha but in the past few years, it has increased.” The actress added, “The best time to visit Delhi is in the winters. I absolutely love winters as I feel the most fashionable during this time. I was born and brought up in Mumbai, so wahan toh sardi hoti nahin hai. We cannot wear nice jackets there.” Echoing the sentiment, Priyaank said, “Not just the weather, the food is amazing too. Kisi bhi restaurant ke Delhi outlet ka khaana hamesha zyada achcha hoga.”Since both the actors belong to filmi families, there is a certain pressure of expectations they face. Priyaank, who is the son of Padmini Kolhapure , said, “Neither do I take pressure nor do I want to because if I do, then I will not be able to perform well. If I start comparing myself with my mom or my cousins ( Shraddha Kapoor and Siddhanth Kapoor ) then I will never be able to truly devote myself to work. Having said that, I think if I can become half the actor my mom is, then I think I am good.” Riva added, “This debate has been ongoing but I don’t think I am gonna let it affect me. I am here to entertain the audience and that’s all I am going to do. I might be a star kid in the eyes of the people but in reality I am just an actor doing my job. I am just taking my baby steps and I hope the audience will love my work.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73056447,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-227774/73056447.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/riva-kishan-the-best-time-to-visit-delhi-is-in-the-winters/articleshow/73056425.cms

26,['2/01/2020'],#MentalHealthMatters: It’s time for digital detox,"In a technology and social media obsessed world, digital detox is one of the crucial steps you can take for your mental well-beingIt’s that time of the year again when New Year resolutions are made. Gyms are flooded with membership requests, while some vow to pursue a sport. Atthe corner paanwala’s, one can hear many well-intentioned souls declare, ‘Bas, yeh mera aakhri sutta hai’. While focus on physical health and being fit is one of the most common (and, of course, important) resolutions that one can make in a new year, there’s a new addition to the list – mental well-being. And in a technology and social media-obsessed world, it seems that digital detox is one of the crucial steps one can take to ensure mental well-being.People give a wide range of reasons for taking a break from social media – ranging from breakup, sleep disorder to depression. While reasons vary, most people agree on one thing – digital detox is essential for mental well-being. Even if it is for few hours a day, it definitely helps in dealing with anxiety. Several studies have also confirmed that disengaging from social media can make one happier and less stressed out.In mid-2019, Chennai-based digital marketer Sorav Jain posted a survey on his blog to determine whether people were digital addicts. His survey showed that 80% of the 2,500 respondents looked at their mobile phones the last thing at night and first thing in the morning, while 70% scrolled through their social media feed to put themselves to sleep.When he decided to go for a digital fast, 512 of the survey respondents, who found they couldn’t do without their phones, decided to go on a fast with him. But a majority of them crashed and burned, several tweeting a couple of hours into the upwaas that they just couldn’t do it.Jain was one of those who succeeded and spent the day playing with his son. He even managed to read an entire book. The survey also showed 40% said they could not live without their phone for even a day. “Most of those who took the survey were in the 18-30 years age group,” Sorav was quoted as saying in a report.In November 2019, a teenager from Bengaluru, Tanvi overcame her Instagram addiction and inspired people to take a #1HrChallenge to stay away from gadgets every day. Tanvi herself was addicted to Instagram. “I used to post pictures regularly and started accepting requests of random people to get more followers and likes on social media. I had over 400 followers in a short time,” Tanvi was quoted as saying in a TOI report. When Tanvi’s academic score fell from 80% to 50%, she realised that there was a problem. She decided to stay away from gadgets. She began organising board game competitions and painting contests for people in her residential complex.In seven months, Tanvi said over 200 people told her how her challenge helped them ‘disconnect from gadgets and connect back to life’. There are many like Sorav and Tanvi who realised that they are ‘digital addicts’ and tried to overcome their addiction, but it wasn’t easy.“We were having a discussion in our office once about who is always online and who is not after work. Turned out that I was the one who was always on social media. So a colleague challenged me that I have to spend a day without looking at any of my phone apps. I took the challenge and thought it would be easy, but that was the first time I realised that I am an addict. I could survive only half a day without checking my phone. But after that experience, I tried taking half-day break from phone one day on the weekend. I succeeded after six weeks and now, I take a day off every week from my phone,” says Sujata Bisht, a 29-year-old resident of Lajpat Nagar.Saloni Singh, a life coach, underwent digital detox classes for 15-20 days twice last year. Her intent was to learn to take a break from social media and ultimately she decided to quit it. “Once you start disengaging from social media platforms, you realise that you end up spending your time more productively and that has a positive impact on your mind,” says Saloni, who is now helping people fight digital addiction. “Different people consume content on social media differently. Some young people tend to believe everything they see on social media. They sometimes set goals inspired by someone else’s life as they see on social media or aspire to be like someone else. When they realise they can’t be like that other person, it results in low self-esteem and depression,” adds Saloni.Writer Advaita Kala was not on any social media platform for a long time while she was in the process of writing. “I was not using any social media platform to use my time productively. Also, I realised that social media is so full of poorly formed opinions that at the end of the day, it just exhausts you. Digital detox is essential for one’s mental well-being,” says Advaita. Shreya Gyawali, a student, shares, “I had just passed out of school and was having a tough time adjusting in Mumbai after living in Hisar for years. Whenever I would log on to Facebook and Instagram, I would see people having a great time. But when I personally interacted with them, I realised that was not the case. Everyone seems to be under pressure to showcase a perfect life on social media and that made me uncomfortable. It made me realise that everyone was filtering their lives and I did not want to do that.”Shreya went off social media for two years and admits that it did have a positive impact on her mental health.– Inputs from Tanya Kundu",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73058223,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-271168/73058223.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/mentalhealthmatters-its-time-for-digital-detox/articleshow/73057605.cms

Cops hunt for nurse killer in Hry, Punjab

CHANDIGARH: A 29-year-old nurse working in a private hospital in Mohali was found murdered in a room of a hotel in Industrial Area, Phase II, on Wednesday in a gory start to the New Year in the city.Sarabjit Kaur's throat had been slit with a sharp-edged weapon. Her killer is suspected to be her 31-year-old friend Maninder Singh, a resident of Sector 30 who is out on bail in a 10-year-old murder case. He had allegedly stabbed a woman to death in a park at Karna Lake, a tourist attraction, in Karnal in 2010.Sarabjit, who belonged to Sangrur in Punjab and was residing in Gracier hostel in Sector 69 of Mohali, had booked the room at Hotel Sky for two days on December 30.

Nobody had visited the room in the last two days, according to the hotel staff.Sarabjit was the youngest among four siblings. Police said she wanted to marry Maninder but her parents were against the relationship. Their main objection was that he belongs to a different caste, police said. The victim and Maninder had stayed in the hotel on several occasions, sources in the police department said. They had been seeing each other for the last two years. Sources said Maninder was a drug addict and had been arrested by the UT police under NDPS Act eight months ago.

28,['2/01/2020'],"With 6 training centres, Bhopal is water sports hub","This story is from January 2, 2020

<p>The waters of Upper and Lower Lakes have produced outstanding sportspersons<br></p>

BHOPAL: Bhopal is a prominent name when it comes to water sports in India. With six water sports centres, Bhopal is fast becoming the water sports hub in the country. At the recently concluded All-India Police Water Sports Meet, a majority of the medallists from the police teams from across the country who participated were trained in Bhopal only.

The waters of Upper and Lower Lakes have produced outstanding sportspersons, who are challenging established champions at national and international meets. In both lakes, water sports centres are being run by the sports department (one each at Upper Lake and Lower Lake), ITBP (Upper Lake), EME (Khanu Gaon Upper Lake), SSB (Lower lake), MP Kayaking and Canoeing Association (MPKCA) and a private boat club (Lower Lake).

Asked about the reason for so many water sports centres, senior coach Mayank Thakur cited the example of Lower Lake. He said water sports centres at the Lower Lake is the only centre in the country providing practice facility on all kinds of boats.

""The water sports centre at Lower Lake is the only centre in the country providing facility of practising on plastic, melo, wazda and other such international boats. It would help players to acclimatize on all kinds of boats,"" said Thakur. Currently, the centre has over 500 boats costing around Rs 7-8 crore.

He added that the water body is very balanced and ideal for water sports events. ""Our centre can host events round-the-year and organize camps in all seasons. Due to this reason, players from across the country are keen to practise in Bhopal,"" said Mayank. The centre conducts around 7-8 campd every year, where the country's best players practise before participating in any big event.

Besides, good geographical conditions have made the state capital the best venue in the country for water sports. ""Upper Lake and Lower Lake has still water, which is best for conducting water sports events. Other places in the country where such water bodies are available are not blessed with the facilities of slow moving wind, peaceful city and world-class facilities,"" claimed secretary general, Indian Kayaking and Canoeing Association (IKCA) Prashant Singh Kushwaha.

Calling their centre the best in the country, former IKCA secretary BS Kushwaha said, ""It is because of excellent infrastructure in Bhopal that Madhya Pradesh has been the national champion in water sports for the past several years.""

Notably, MP won the title of both boys and girls categories in the recently concluded junior kayaking and canoeing championship.

""The centre has made it possible for the country to think of medals in water sports in the next two Olympics,"" claimed Prashant.

The director of sports, department, SL Thaosen said, ""National sailing school and other centres have made Bhopal an attractive centre in the country.""

The UP government’s attempt to identify and make rioters pay for the damage caused to public property during the recent anti-citizenship law protests is without precedent in a country where many states have, at one time or another, endured destruction on the streets in the name of agitation. The only other instance of strong punitive action being ordered for vandalising public property is against the Dera Sacha Sauda in Punjab, albeit on court orders.While the jury is out on whether the Yogi Adityanath government’s move will stand legal scrutiny, TOI takes stock of the number of occasions over the past five years that individuals and outfits appear to have got away with destroying public property worth crores of rupees during protests.The Jat quota stir in February 2016 was a destructive one, resulting in 30 deaths and widespread damage to public and private property. Assocham estimated the loss in monetary terms to be Rs 1,800-2,000 crore. Around 2,100 cases were filed and hundreds arrested. The then BJP government told the Punjab and Haryana high court that the cost of the damage would be recovered from the perpetrators, but it was never done.In August 2017, vandalism returned to the state after a special CBI court convicted Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim in multiple rape cases. Property worth Rs 126 crore was damaged in Panchkula alone. The high court ordered that properties belonging to Dera Sacha Sauda be frozen till such time “liability” for the losses caused during the violence was decided. The case continues.On August 22 last year, thousands of protesting Dalits led by Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad damaged 14 cars at Govindpuri. In November, lawyers at Tis Hazari damaged 13 police vehicles and set fire to several bikes while clashing with the cops over a parking dispute. Similar violence was reported at Saket. Nobody was even arrested.But after the arson during anti-CAA protests at Jamia Nagar and Mathura Road on December 15, Police approached the HC to appoint a claims commissioner who would assess the damage and “establish liability”.Within just three days of the Patidar quota movement in August 2015, mobs torched 660 government vehicles and 1,822 public buildings. A week after the riots, a PIL was filed in the Gujarat HC, seeking an inquiry commission to assess the damage. The PIL was withdrawn two weeks later.The railways bore the brunt of the vandalism and arson that marred the anti-citizenship law protests last month, losing an estimated Rs 80 crore worth of property in just four days. According to the state government, 64 FIRs were lodged and 931 people arrested. The Calcutta high court is hearing six PILs on fixing responsibility for the damage.Property worth Rs 20 crore was damaged after violence erupted in Puri on October 3, 2018, during a bandh called by an outfit called Jagannath Sena. Police subsequently made it mandatory for organisations to sign an indemnity bond while seeking permission to hold rallies.Around 15 vehicles, including police vans and buses, were set ablaze in Bengaluru in April 2016 by garments factory workers protesting against the Centre’s decision to amend the Employees Provident Fund Act. On September 12 the same year, the Cauvery riots ravaged public property, with more than 30 buses being damaged. No attempt was made by the government to recover damages in either of these cases.In 2018, as many as 49 state-owned buses were damaged in Pathanamthitta district and several more across other districts during protests that greeted the Supreme Court’s verdict on entry of women into the Sabarimala shrine. Many were arrested under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984, but the loss due to damage of public property was never recovered.In October 2011, the Kerala HC had ordered that in the event of public property being damaged, an amount equivalent to the loss must be deposited by the accused as a condition for bail.The first few days of the anti-citizenship law protests that broke out last month saw public property being vandalised in Guwahati and Dibrugarh . The BJP-led government plans to initiate “proper legal action against the instigators of violence” after collecting more evidence.: There have been multiple instances of vandalism and arson, including during the agitation against the film Padmaavat in November 2017 and the Gujjar community’s quota stir in February 2019. In none of these instances did the state even calculate the extent of damage to public property.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73062878,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2286850,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-indias-long-history-of-protests-up-first-to-make-vandals-pay-price/articleshow/73062873.cms
31,['2/01/2020'],"New Year Wishes: PM Modi greets neighbourhood leaders on New Year, skips Pakistan","This story is from January 2, 2020

NEW DELHI: On the first day of the new year , PM Narendra Modi reiterated India’s commitment to its “neighbourhood first” policy and a “vision of shared peace and prosperity” in telephonic conversations with leaders of all countries in the region except Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.

The Prime Minister spelled out a commitment to prosperity and progress for all of India’s “friends and partners in the region”. Sources said the current circumstances in India-Pakistan bilateral ties didn’t lend themselves to a similar call to Khan though they didn't rule out an exchange of greetings in some form later.

The already stuttering ties with Pakistan further dipped after the abrogation of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status last August that led to Islamabad launching a diplomatic offensive. Khan attacked India for the “anti-Muslim” measure and spoke of nuclear conflict in an effort to attract global attention and India’s counter-offensive sent bilateral ties into a deep freeze.

One of the first leaders Modi spoke to was Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina , whom he congratulated on being re-elected as president of the Awami League for the next three years. Modi also expressed his condolences on the untimely demise of former high commissioner of Bangladesh to India Syed Muazzem Ali.

“He also mentioned the upcoming birth centenary of Bangabandhu and 50 years of the liberation of Bangladesh and establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties besides important milestones to further the progress in close India-Bangladesh ties, a priority of his government,” said an official statement.

The conversation is important in the context of heated politics over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act which has seen frequent references to illegal migrants from Bangladesh and the “persecution” of Hindus in that country.

In his conversation with Prime Minister K P Oli of Nepal, Modi expressed satisfaction at the progress of relations in 2019, with the completion of several projects. He specifically noted the completion of the Motihari (India)-Amlekhgunj (Nepal) petroleum product pipeline in record time. Both leaders also agreed on early inauguration of the integrated checkpost in Biratnagar and the housing reconstruction project in Nepal through video-conference. Oli later tweeted about his conversation in which he said there was mention of the need to address pending issues.

Modi also spoke to Bhutan King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, PM Lotay Tshering, and Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and PM Mahinda Rajapaksa, as also Maldives President Ibrahim Solih.

“The Prime Minister conveyed to the leaders his New Year greetings and good wishes on behalf of the people of India and on his own behalf,” added the statement. In his conversation with the Bhutan king, Modi spoke of important achievements that led to further consolidation of special ties between India and Bhutan.

""The Prime Minister fondly recalled his last visit to Bhutan and the love and affection he received from the people there. He also emphasised the need to enhance youth exchanges between the two countries. The Prime Minister also mentioned that he was looking forward to forthcoming visit of the king to India,” said the government.

Gotabaya was said to have warmly reciprocated Modi’s wishes and expressed confidence that India and Sri Lanka would further enhance friendly ties in 2020. The two leaders reiterated their commitment to closely work together towards this end.

With Mahinda, Modi reiterated India’s commitment to further expand close and extensive cooperation with Sri Lanka. PM Rajapaksa reciprocated the wishes warmly and expressed a keen desire to further enhance relations between the two countries.

33,['2/01/2020'],India will work out its own model of theatre commands: CDS Rawat,"Chief of Defense Staff (CDS) Bipin Rawat

NEW DELHI: India will work out its own mechanisms for theatre commands, says the chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat , in the backdrop of the urgent need to build an integrated land-air-sea war-fighting machinery for a greater combat punch despite the ongoing fund crunch for military modernisation.“There are methods of doing ‘theaterisation’. We don’t have to copy from western methods or others. We can have our own systems. We will jointly work out mechanisms…I think it will work,” said Gen Rawat, after taking the tri-service guard of honour at South Block on Wednesday. Though Gen Rawat did not spell out the details, sources said he has been tasked by the government to initiate and spearhead doctrinal and transformational changes as well as prepare a roadmap for the first new theatre command to be set up in four to five years.This, of course, will take some doing because the Army, Navy and IAF zealously guard their turfs. India’s only theatre or geographical command in the strategically-located Andaman and Nicobar archipelago, which places all the assets and manpower of the three services under one operational commander, has largely failed to realise its potential due to inter-service rivalry, general politico-bureaucratic apathy and funding problems since it was set up in 2001.The PMO and defence establishment have discussed the need to have integrated commands over the last few years. There was even a proposal to establish theatre commands in the shape of one or two (one each for west and east of Nepal ) for the “northern borders” with China, a western command for Pakistan , a counter-insurgency operations command and one southern or two peninsular commands for the maritime borders. A strategic air command, in turn, could be handled by the IAF.But the IAF had strongly opposed the move, stressing it would be operationally unwise to divide the country’s “limited air assets” among different theatre commands. The force, after all, has just 30 fighter squadrons when at least 42 are needed for requisite deterrence against any collusive threat from Pakistan and China.Similar is the case with other critical platforms like AWACS (airborne warning and control systems) and mid-air refuelling aircraft. “The entire country should be treated as one theatre. We have shown through ‘Gagan Shakti’ and other exercises that the IAF can swiftly switch its assets from the western to eastern front, and vice-versa, if the need arises,” said a senior IAF officer.But the dominant opinion in the defence establishment is that the time has come for India — which has as many as 17 single-service commands — to move towards integrated commands to save resources and prepare for wars of the future.Gen Rawat, on his part, said, “The task is cut out for the CDS to integrate the three services and enhance their capabilities through teamwork. We must ensure the 1+1+1 combine of the three services adds up to 5 or 7, and not 3. Synergy is needed. The whole should be more than the sum of the parts.” He added he would strive to achieve jointness in operations, planning, procurements, logistics, transport, training and the like within the three-year deadline set by the government.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73062934,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1788835,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-will-work-out-its-own-model-of-theatre-commands-cds-rawat/articleshow/73062932.cms

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday described creation of the department of military affairs and institutionalisation of the post of chief of defence staff as “momentous reforms” and said the first CDS, Gen Bipin Rawat , is an “outstanding officer” who has served India with great zeal.

“Creation of the Department of Military Affairs with requisite military expertise and institutionalisation of the post of CDS is a momentous and comprehensive reform that will help our country face the ever-changing challenges of modern warfare,” Modi tweeted.

“As the first CDS takes charge, I pay homage to all those who have served and laid down their lives for our nation. I recall the valiant personnel who fought in Kargil, after which many discussions on reforming our military began, leading to today’s historic development,” he said.

“This institution carries tremendous responsibility of modernising our military forces. It would also reflect the hopes and aspirations of 1.3 billion Indians,” Modi said.

A key mandate of the CDS will be to facilitate restructuring of military commands for optimal utilisation of resources by bringing about jointness in operations, through establishment of joint and theatre commands.

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan exchanged through diplomatic channels the customary list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the agreement on prohibition of attack against nuclear installations between India and Pakistan. Though routine and a well established practice, the adherence to protocol comes after worsening India-Pakistan ties that have seen Prime Minister Imran Khan and other ministers in Pakistan raise the nuclear bogey several times in 2019 over incidents like the air strike on Balakot and the abrogation of J&K’s special status.

India and Pakistan also exchanged list of prisoners under their 2008 agreement and asked Islamabad to expedite grant of visas to Indian medical experts to allow them to assess the mental condition of Indian prisoners. India also called for early visit of the Joint Judicial Committee to Pakistan. The exchange of information on nuclear facilities is in keeping with the 1988 agreement which calls for the two countries to inform each other of nuclear installations and facilities to be covered under the same agreement on the first of January of every calendar year. This is the 29th consecutive exchange of such a list between the two countries, the first one having taken place on 1st January, 1992. On the prisoner issue, India handed over a list of 267 Pakistan civilian prisoners and 99 fishermen to Pakistan who are in India’s custody. Similarly, Pakistan shared lists of 55 civilian prisoners and 227 fishermen in its custody, who are Indians or believed to be.

“In this context Pakistan was asked to expedite the release and repatriation of four Indian civilian prisoners and 126 Indian fishermen to India whose nationality has been confirmed and conveyed to Pakistan. In addition, Pakistan has been asked to provide immediate consular access to 14 believed-to-be Indian civilian prisoners and 100 Indian fishermen who are in Pakistan’s custody,” the government said in a statement.

J K Lon hospital (file photo)

KOTA/JAIPUR: At least nine more infants have died at Kota’s J K Lon Hospital in the last two days, taking the toll to 100 in December 2019.

The number of infant deaths in the same hospital in December 2018 was 77, the hospital authorities confirmed on Wednesday.

“At least nine newborns and infants have died in J K Lon Hospital on December 30 and 31. The number of kids’ deaths in December has reached 100,” the hospital superintendent, Dr Suresh Dulara, said on Wednesday.

He added, “On December 30, four kids died and on December 31 five kids died. All of them died mainly due to low birth weight and birth weight hypothesis.”

The Rajasthan government on Tuesday ordered hospitals attached to medical colleges to check the functional status of all medical equipment and send reports.

Last week, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and health minister Raghu Sharma had claimed that that most of the children who died were referred to the hospital in critical condition from nearby districts, including regions of neighbouring Madhya Pradesh .

The hospital superintendent claimed on Wednesday that the number of infant deaths at the hospital in 2019 was lower than 2018 and the lowest in last six years. “At least 1,005 kids died in 2018 in the hospital, while 963 died in 2019,” said Dulara.

The number of infant deaths at J K Lon Hospital has witnessed a constant decline since 2014 when 1,198 deaths were recorded, which was 7.6% of the 15,719 admitted, according to data from Kota district collector Om Kasera and the hospital superintendent. The percentage declined to 7.2% in 2015, 6.6% in 2016, 5.9% in 2017, 6.1% in 2018 and 5.7 %, the lowest, in 2019, the hospital superintendent said.

Following the controversy over the high number of infant deaths in December 2019 alone, the hospital has put in efforts for the upgradation and maintenance of its medical equipment, as well as reconstruction of paediatric units and deputations to make up the insufficiency of medical and nursing staff in the hospital.

The principal of Medical College Kota, Dr Vijay Sardana, said, “The units of the paediatric department have been subdivided into three units. The HOD’s office will be in J K Lon Hospital and the non-teaching unit will be working on the New Medical College Hospital premises.”

He added, “A work order for installation of a central oxygen supply line in the hospital has been issued and work would be completed within 15 days. Proposals for new OPD and emergency wards for the paediatric and gynecology departments have been incorporated in the proposed OPD block under the Smart City Project.”

Taking serious note of TOI’s report on December 30 headlined “Over 50% of gadgets in Kota hospital where kids died defunct”, the medical education department wrote to the principals and controllers of all medical colleges saying: “An immediate stock-taking of all the equipment should be carried out to make sure that all the gadgets are in use and their annual maintenance contracts (AMCs) are in place.”

“For equipment whose AMCs have not been done, the process should be immediately initiated after stock-taking,” wrote Vaibhav Galriya, principal secretary, medical education.

While pointing out that some equipment might be lying in hospital stores after purchase, he directed that a physical verification of the stores be done to ensure that such machines are identified and put to use immediately.

Galriya has also pulled up doctors while pointing out that hospitals are not properly maintaining IPD bed tickets. “It has also been observed in some hospitals that IPD bed tickets are not being properly maintained. History and clinical notes of the patients are incomplete. All departments and treating doctors must be instructed to make sure that proper recording of patients’ medical information is done after their admission to the IPD,” he said in the circular.

Also, proper counselling of patients and their attendants should be done. “They should be briefed regarding the disease and health of the patients,” he wrote.

To prevent infection from spreading, he pointed out that microbiological surveillance of operation theatres (OTs) and ICUs must be regularly done at least once a month and samples taken from all relevant portions of OTs and ICUs.

The hospitals attached to medical colleges will also ensure that bacteriological reports of the samples should detail the bacteria for which the culture is positive or negative and take curative action. Standard infection control practices, including hand hygiene, should be ensured in all OTs, ICUs, labour and procedure rooms, said Galriya’s directions to all medical colleges.

PATNA: It may be unbelievable but the criminal who robbed Rs9.12 lakh from the United Bank of India (UBI) branch near Patna Junction on Tuesday had fled by a city bus after committing the crime, according to police sources.

The lone robber, who pretended to be armed with a pistol after wrapping his right palm and wrist with a towel, had barged into the bank branch at 3.04pm and escaped with the cash from the counter within two minutes. The UBI branch is 50 years’ old.

When asked, a senior police officer preferring anonymity said the criminal after looting the money had used a public transport to escape. “He had boarded a city bus which runs on the Station Road route of the state capital. His movements had been caught in the CCTV cameras installed near the bank,” he said.

Meanwhile, another IPS officer preferring anonymity said the criminal, after coming out of the bank with looted cash, first crossed the busy Station Road near Patna Junction and then boarded a bus. “That bus had stopped finally near auto stand roundabout under Kankarbagh police station area where Patna Municipal Corporation’s office is located,” he said.

The officer said the bus had stopped at four different places along the route. “The criminal had alighted from the bus at one of these places only. The bus driver has been interrogated and police could get some details about the criminal from him,” he said, adding that police were trying to pinpoint the location where the criminal had alighted from the bus.

He said technical investigation was going on to gather further clue for arresting the criminal.

Meanwhile, outgoing SSP Garima Malik said it was clear that the criminal had reached the branch alone. “Investigations were going on to ascertain his identity and arrest him,” she said.

Rahman said Chaitu Kumar, Sanoj Kumar alias Dhelwa and one Deepak Mahto were arrested from their residences at Uttari Sangat on Tuesday and the body was recovered on their confession. He said all three work as autorickshaw driver.

The SHO said a semi-automatic country-made pistol with five live cartridges of 7.65mm were recovered from Deepak’s residence. The weapon was also used by him during the riot. “The body was dumped in dense vegetation. It took almost six hours to search and recover the body even though the criminals had told the police about the place where they had dumped Amir’s body,” he said, adding that police also seized a small two-wheel garbage cart which was used to carry the body after the murder.

Rahman said Chaitu and Sanoj had been to jail in 2012 in a double murder case while Deepak is also involved in liquor smuggling. “Chaitu had been to jail for liquor smuggling during Holi last year,” he said.

Passengers waiting for their trains at Patna Junction on Wednesday.

PATNA: Foggy weather conditions continued to affect the movement of passenger trains in all the five divisions under East Central Railway (ECR). While 93 passenger trains were delayed due to fog on Tuesday, several mail and express trains were running late by four to five hours on Wednesday.

According to an ECR official, at least 30 passenger trains reaching the Danapur division were delayed on Tuesday followed by 33 in Mughalsarai, 20 in Sonepur, 6 in Dhanbad and 4 in Samastipur division. “The dense fog prevailing in the entire northern region on the New Delhi-Kanpur-Allahabad-Pt Deendayal Upadhaya Junction-Patna Junction route was badly affected,” the official said, adding that the stretch between Tundala and Allahabad was the bottleneck causing slow traffic movement due to poor visibility on tracks.

Danapur railway official told this newspaper on Wednesday that New Delhi-Rajendra Nagar Terminal Rajdhani Express (12310) reached Patna Junction about 90 minutes late, while New Delhi-Patna Sampoorna Kranti Express (12392) was delayed by 210 minutes and New Delhi-Rajgir Shramjeevi Express (12394) by about 180 minutes on Wednesday.

Extra alertness is being maintained on bridges where night track patrolling is being carried out under the supervision of senior safety officers.

“Loco pilots have been directed not to take risk and follow winter safety measures on the Delhi-Kanpur-Allahabad route due to zero visibility on the tracks during night,” sources said.

CHENNAI: Riding on heavy discounts particularly for BS4 models, retail sales of cars and SUVs have shown an increase for three consecutive months. According to the Vahan vehicle registration data shared by the government, passenger vehicle registrations were up 6.25% in November, 14% in October and 8% in September (see chart). This three-month on-the-trot sales increase comes after five months of continuous sales slump (see chart). The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), the industry apex body for auto dealers, says December too should see positive retail numbers for passenger vehicles though the bloodbath continues for the trucks and buses segment.“In December, dealers are expecting a small increase in sales. October saw positive retail due to festival demand, November the trend continued as the discounts continued and December too should see some uptick. The inventory levels are now very normal at 4 weeks countrywide and around 3 weeks in some markets and the liquidity situation is also improving with banks increasing their working capital and other financing,” said FADA president Ashish Harsharaj Kale. What has helped the situation, he added, are planned production cuts by car companies in the run up to the BS6 shift.“What’s happening is less a turnaround than a bottoming out with passenger vehicle numbers looking stronger month-on-month. The used car trade has also been quite active which is another indicator,” explained Kumar Kandaswami, partner, Deloitte .Used car marketers agree that the sector has been both strong demand and supply right through calendar 2019. “We were expecting a slightly softer December compared to October and November but used vehicle sales continue to be strong,” said Droom founder-CEO Sandeep Aggarwal. Online marketplace Droom, he said, sold used vehicles worth Rs 636 crore in October and Rs 604 crore in November and is looking to close December with around Rs 625 crore worth of business.The total passenger vehicle market (used and new) is currently 9 million units strong (used 5 million units, new 4 million units) and worth $77 billion (new $39 billion and used $38 billion).Auto financiers however say that December retails of some OEMS could be impacted by the production cuts taken to clean up the BS4 stocks. “December has seen some supply issues with a few OEMs that have been discontinuing their BS4 models.

New Year visitors at Patna Zoo on Wednesday.

PATNA: The city parks and major hotspots teemed with revellers who celebrated the first day of 2020 with their families, relatives and friends with gusto and fervour.

Eco Park, Gandhi Maidan and Patna zoo among other places were buzzing with crowd, as residents preferred to spend the cold day under bright sunshine. Kids enjoyed playing at children’s park zone while people gorged on street food, reminiscing the best moments of year 2019 and taking the New Year resolutions while releasing balloons, taking selfies or groupies and listening music.

Hemlata Kumari, an entrepreneur, spent the day at Eco Park and enjoyed the double-cycle ride with her son and husband. “I like skating but lose balance. So, I have taken the resolution to learn skating and devote more time to my family this year,” she said.

Patnaites enjoyed zorbing , boating, cycling, zipline, trampoline , skating, rope course set-up and rope climbing at Eco Park.

For young girls, picnic at zoo, movies and luncheon at cafés is what the New Year celebration was all about. Monica Singh, a student of Patna Women’s College, said she planned the outing in daytime with her friends and dinner with her family. “I watched a movie and spent the noon at zoo. The restaurant at the zoo was overcrowded, so we had lunch at nearby café,” she said.

Many people were seen buying balloon and releasing it in the air after making New Year resolution. Shailendra Tiwari, a resident of Nasriganj , said he enjoyed boating at Gandhi Ghat with his family and friends. “We made a joint resolution to indulge more in charity work and distributed warm clothes to less privileged people on this occasion,” he said.

Women were seen playing antakshri, housie and dumb charades at the Ganga riverfront. Many couples were sitting at cosy kiosks and planning their future course of action.

Swati Pandey (24), a resident of Agamkuan said, “This is the first day of the year and I wanted to make it memorable. I spent the whole night baking cakes and muffins and sent it to my friends and relatives. I have also planned late night movie with my family following a dinner party,” she said.

There were long queues outside the Patna Museum and Bihar Museum and people were seen jostling to get entry tickets even though most of such places had doubled their entry fees.

Outdoor places like Gandhi Maidan and other parks were perfect picnic spots where revellers enjoyed games like badminton, cricket and football besides playing cards, snakes and ladders, carrom and ludo.

For some people, partying at home was the best idea to spend the first day of the year. Minakshi Sinha and Tushar, who were recently got married, spent their time together with their family and cooked exquisite delicacies. “Earlier, we had decided to spend the New Year at Goa. However, due to some unavoidable reasons, we stayed back and spent the day with my family,” Tushar said.

Ayesha Khanum, a student of Magadh Mahila College and resident of Alamganj, said New Year celebrations were incomplete without sharing sweets, exchanging cards and calendars. “I organized a lunch party at my home for my friends and shared cards and gifts,” she said.

Shopaholics spent their day on buying dresses and other accessories as many markets, shopping plazas and malls offered exclusive offers. Movie buffs watched shows at theatres and gorged on food at nearby restaurants.

50,['2/01/2020'],"Patna air quality very poor, Muzaffarpur AQI worst in country","This story is from January 2, 2020

A boy protects himself from air pollution in Patna on Wednesday.

PATNA: The state capital and Muzaffarpur ushered in the New Year with very poor air quality. The air quality index (AQI) of Muzaffarpur remained ‘severe’ on Wednesday, whereas that of Patna was in ‘very poor’ category.

According to the figures released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI of Muzaffarpur was recorded at 465 on Wednesday, which was the worst in the country. Patna’s AQI, on the other hand, was recorded at 365.

Track the pollution level in your city

Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) officials stated that the overall AQI of 365 for Patna was the average of AQI level at planetarium (439), BIT-Mesra, Patna (372), Eco Park (312) and SK Memorial Hall (321).

BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh told this newspaper on Wednesday that the air quality of Patna and Muzaffarpur deteriorated because of three weather conditions — low wind velocity, increase in moisture level and decline in temperature. “Vehicle movement even at night on December 31 was another factor for the increase in AQI level at Patna and Muzaffarpur,” he said.

“The overall AQI level of the city has increased drastically. If we had only one air quality monitoring station at the planetarium, then Patna’s AQI level could also have been in severe category,” he added.

The BSPCB chairman further said one more air quality station would soon come up at Muzaffarpur and another at Gaya. “The data of one monitoring station in a city is not sufficient at all. I personally think that at least four stations are needed in any city to get a broader scenario with regard to air pollution, but for bigger cities like Patna, 10 air monitoring stations are must,” Ghosh said.

BSPCB is, in fact, in the process of installing two more air quality monitoring stations near DRM office at Danapur and Government Boy’s High School in Patna City by January 15.

Pradhan Parth Sarthi, professor at Department of Environmental Science of Central University of South Bihar (CUSB), said weather factors like low wind velocity, foggy conditions and low temperature have led to thermal inversion phenomenon in the atmosphere, which, in turn, has trapped the suspended particulate matter in the lower level of atmosphere. “The conditions can improve only with northwesterly wind and rainfall,” he added.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With his security team denying clearance, President Ram Nath Kovind will not be visiting Sabarimala during his visit to the state on Sunday, it is learnt.

The Pathanamthitta district police chief is learnt to have submitted a report to the district collector flagging concerns over security that can be provided to the President. The police chief had expressed concern over the safety of landing a helicopter on the water tank at Pandithavalam as per a plan. In his report the district police chief had also raised concerns on providing security to the President at the temple due to the heavy rush of pilgrims at Sannidhanam.

Earlier, the engineering division of the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) had assessed that small helicopters could land on top of the water tank.

“That is the preliminary assessment and we have informed the Rashtrapathi Bhavan. Our engineers are of the view that the water tank is strong enough for small choppers. Now Rashtrapathi Bhavan has to take the final call,” TDB president N Vasu had said.

Devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran said earlier on Wednesday that the state government was awaiting official confirmation from Rashtrapathi Bhavan over his visit to the temple. “The government has informed about the facilities we can provide for his visit,” he said.

The Rashtrapathi Bhavan had enquired about the facilities that can be arranged if the President comes for a darshan. He is scheduled to arrive in Kochi on Sunday enroute to Lakshadweep .

53,['2/01/2020'],City schools hail CBSE’s anger-free zone initiative,"This story is from January 2, 2020

PATNA: The schools in Patna have welcomed the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) initiative to make schools anger-free zones. The board believes that this will improve the mental health of students and make their learning environment prosperous.

CBSE, on December 23, sent a letter to all its affiliated schools instructing them to reserve one period everyday for health and physical education. The board suggests that students should be encouraged to involve themselves in sports activities and yoga as it will decrease anger issues.

St Karen’s Secondary School principal KK Kunjachan said the CBSE has suggested some initiatives, including smiling at each other, talking to students calmly and practising breathing exercises. “This will help the students in developing affective skills. It is a welcome step,” Kunjachan said.

Baldwin Academy principal Rajiv Ranjan Sinha appreciated the Board’s initiative and considers it beneficial for the healthy growth of students. Ranjan, who is also the city coordinator of CBSE, said, “Our aim is to talk to students calmly and listen to their problems. We hope to find out solutions to their problems by cooperating with them. Besides, the school will also be taking steps to counsel teachers and parents so that they can reach out to the students and help them in anger management.”

Principal of Litera Valley School, Sharat Kumar Singh, considers its as a noble intention of CBSE, which will help students in channelizing their energy in constructive way. “The teachers will be directed to take this initiative further by talking to students composedly. I will personally urge the teachers to make good choice of words while dealing with the students,” he said.

CB Singh, director of Dr DY Patil Pushpalata Patil International School, said they are preparing a ‘Teacher-Guardian’ scheme to make school no-anger zone. “The teachers will prepare a list of shot-tempered students and they will be managed by happy-go-luck teachers. Besides, we have already put up happy quotes and smiles across the school campus,” he said.

54,['2/01/2020'],Further shortage of IAS officers likely as 22 will retire this year,"This story is from January 2, 2020

PATNA: There will be further shortage of IAS officers in Bihar as altogether 22 officers of the state cadre, including chief secretary Deepak Kumar, are scheduled to retire this year.

As per the Centre’s department of personnel and training’s (DoPT) notification, the total authorized cadre strength of IAS officers in Bihar is 342. But only 237 officers were available on the state government’s roll on January 1, creating a shortage of 105.

“The retirement of 22 more officers in 2020 will only add up to the existing shortage, unless the Centre takes necessary steps to fill the vacancies by granting promotion to the state civil service (SCS) officers or sends more direct recruits to the state,” an official of general administration department (GAD), who didn’t want to be identified, told TOI on Wednesday.

“If new officers are not added to the state’s roll, the total shortage will reach up to 127 by the end of 2020,” the officer said.

Besides Deepak (1984-batch), who is now scheduled to retire on August 31 after getting six months’ service extension, four more officers of chief secretary-rank from the Bihar cadre are retiring this year. They are C K Mishra (1983-batch), Ajay Kumar (1984), Rabindra Pawar (1985) and RK Mahajan (1987 batch). While Mishra, Kumar and Pawar are currently on the central deputation, Mahajan is serving as additional chief secretary in education department with the additional charge of vigilance department.

Two officers in the principal secretary rank — Deepak Prasad (1989-batch) and S M Raju (1991-batch) — are also scheduled to retire on August 31 and July 31 this year, respectively. While Prasad is currently on leave, Raju is suspended on the charges of corruption with effect from January 12, 2017.

Other IAS officers holding key posts and retiring this year are the district magistrates (DMs) of Khagaria and Lakhisarai. While Khagaria DM Aniruddh Kumar will be superannuating on May 31, his Lakhisarai counterpart Shobhendra Kumar Choudhary is to retire on October 31.

Sources in the GAD said out of the total cadre strength of 342, altogether 74 posts are meant for central deputation. It means 74 IAS officers from Bihar cadre can be sent on the central deputation at a time. But currently, only 36 officers (less than 50%) from Bihar cadre are on the central deputation.

55,['2/01/2020'],Curbs on plastic: Traders seek affordable alternatives,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The statewide plastic ban , which came into effect on Wednesday, has put traders across the district in distress as they now face a crisis in delivery of products.

The unused stock of plastic carry bags which were bought in bulk by paying a minimal sum as low as Rs 1 per bag, and having to pay Rs 12 or more per piece of alternatives have resulted in huge loss to most of the traders.

While several of the traders are ready to accept the ban on plastic bags , they unanimously called for a need to introduce alternatives at similar prices to that of plastic products.

Krishnan K, a vegetable vendor of Chalai market said that it is the vegetable, fruit and grocery vendors who are the worst hit. “We used to buy carry bags in bulk, which cost Rs 50-100 for 100-120 carry bags. But it costs more than Rs 10 to buy a single cloth bag. We need affordable alternatives,” he said.

Vijaya Kumar, who runs a grocery shop, shared a similar opinion. “Regular customers who come to buy dairy products now bring carry bags with them but as our shop is in the heart of a busy market, we cannot expect everyone to do the same. How many people will be willing to pay an additional Rs 10 for a carry bag?” he asks.

Flower merchants too are concerned about alternative options. According to Jayan G of Omkaram Flowers, it is impossible to find an alternative to transport flowers in bulk. “For small orders, we can use leaf bundles but for festival orders of 6-10kg, we require giant carry bags. With plastic carry bags, we had such flexibility but alternative materials suggested do not provide such an option. We still don’t think this ruling will stay for long and things will revert back to normal before Onam,” he said.

City corporation, which is determined to carry forward the initiative, is pushing sales of cloth bags. Mayor K Sreekumar inaugurated a cloth bag counter at Gandhi Park on Wednesday. The counter which will be functioning at corporation office from Thursday will accept all banned carry bags and also sell cloth bags.

According to cloth bag project implementation officer R Sasikumar, the tailor-made bags will come in various sizes as required.

“We have included 100 Kudumbhashree members in the project, who will make the cloth bags at our centres at Muttada, Vallakadavu, Pongumoodu, Valiyavila and Kunnampara. A bag of normal size, which cost us Rs 25 to prepare, has been given 50% subsidy and will come at a rate of Rs 12.50 per bag. Also, bags will come in various sizes and we will take orders as required,” Sasikumar said.

Tekriwal runs a female-only led plane aggregator start-up that operates, manages, and flies planes for owners.Though there are many funds to invest and encourage female entrepreneurs, they are still on papers.“Besides funds, the government must set up dedicated start-up incubation centres solely for women. These centres should hear out our challenges and help find legal, financial and technical solutions. I know a couple young and enthusiastic girls with craving for fashion technology, but investors feel women can’t be good with tech,” Tekriwal added.On the other hand, Saha Fund chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder, Ankita Vashistha, which funds female entrepreneurs, said, “There is no shortage of appetite among women entrepreneurs, as we saw a 15% growth in applications or enquiries for investment in 2019.”“Since, the market has seen slowdown this year, we have not seen much investment.

AHMEDABAD: The prohibition laws made stringent more than two years ago have not brought about the feared severity in punishment for boozing and bootlegging, thanks to Gujarat ’s courts which believe in tempering justice with mercy.Sahil Vegda was caught loitering on a public street in an inebriated condition in Kagdapith police station last year. A local court took up his case last month. He immediately admitted his guilt and was convicted under the amended Gujarat Prohibition Act, which prescribes a jail term of up to one year and a fine. However, the court imposed a fine of Rs 500 on Vegda and ordered him to sit in the courtroom for a day as his punishment.There were various reasons put forth by the court for showing leniency to Vegda. It cited a judgment of Gujarat high court passed by Justice J N Bhatt and said that the courts are still governed by the law laid down by the high court so far as punishment is concerned upon the accused confessing his crime.The court also said that it was Vegda’s first offence and that he had responsibility of his family. His financial situation is weak. Vegda promised not to repeat the offence.The court said that if he was sent to jail, his family would starve. If huge fine is imposed, his family will suffer.

63,['2/01/2020'],Style meets substance in calendar brought out by budding designers,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Tirupur: To usher in the New Year in style , students of the NIFT-TEA College of Knitwear Fashion here have released a calendar for the fifth consecutive year.

The students concentrated on five fashion trends bridal, casual, contemporary, party and wearable art. They not only designed the garments but also created the props in the background and also handled photography and editing.

“Fashion is not just about garments and fabrics but also about the properties in the background, makeup, aesthetics, styling, art and layout. Our students created everything to give life to the calendar, which has come out very well,” said G Boopathy Vijay, an assistant professor.

“As themes, they chose history for August, as the month is associated with the country’s independence. A knitted garment with prints has the background with newspaper headlines on the death of Mahatma Gandhi, twin bombs destroying Hiroshima and Nagasaki, death of Hitler and sinking of the Titanic,” Boopathy told TOI.

The students created a mini chariot using cardboards to suit an Indian ethnic wear for November, the month of Diwali, said S Sabarissh, a second-year student of the apparel fashion designing department, one of the six students, who made the calendar. “For the month of December, our theme has dew falling in the background, to denote the Christmas season.”

“We created retro fashion concepts using a large-size guitar, toothed wheels and radio as background,” said P Gnana Prakash Raj, who took the photos and edited them. The other four students who contributed were P Manish, N L Aabash Kumar, S Ragu Prasanth and A Kavin.

Five girl students modelled for the calendar, Boopathy said. “Usually, April Fool’s Day is associated with pranks. So, we designed a fashion wear inspired by the Joker, the character played by Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight.”

Nainital: Nainital police issued challans to 35 people, including five Thailand nationals studying at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), for violating traffic rules on New Year ’s Eve.

Speaking to TOI, Mallital station house officer, Ashok Kumar, said, “The students had come to Nainital with their friends to celebrate New Year’s Eve but they were not wearing helmets and therefore were violating traffic rules. We caught them near Mallital rickshaw stand and fined them Rs 500 each,” he said. The foreign students paid the fines on the spot after which they were let off by the police. However, the entire area got blocked to witness these foreign students riding colourful bikes being fined by the police.

These challans were issued by the police in the Mallital area since the Tallital police station was busy managing traffic arrangements. “Our main task was to manage the flow of traffic since Mallital is the entry point for tourists to Tallital. However, we did carry out a drive on Monday when we challaned over 60 people and even seized a vehicle. Most of these people were tourists and hadcome from places such as Delhi and other nearby areas. We have also seized a vehicle of a tourist which will be returned after proper procedure,” police said.

Coimbatore: Except for a few road accidents , the city welcomed the New Year with special prayers at religious places, revelry on roads and parties at hotels.

The city police ensured fatal accident-free New Year celebrations that went on till 2am on Wednesday with fun and frolic.

The city police made extensive arrangements to curtail speeding, drag racing and drunk driving.

As many as 25 check points were set up on Avinashi Road and Race Course to detain traffic violators. To tighten the security, 1,500 police personnel were deployed across the city and patrolling was carried out in 44 two-wheelers and 26 four-wheelers. Certain entry points from Avinashi Road and Race Couse were temporarily blocked with barricades to prevent untoward incidents.

However, 14 people sustained minor injuries in road accidents in the city.

A police officer said hundreds of bikers were detained for speeding or drunk driving ahead of the celebrations and were let off only after the celebrations were over. Cases were not registered against them, he added. The bikers were given a piece of cake to mark the New Year celebrations.

Hours after celebrations were wound up, B Ansaruddin, 20, a resident of GM Nagar in Karumbukadai, died in road accident after he lost control of his vehicle and dashed a tree at Ukkadam by-pass road around 4.30am on Wednesday. He died on the spot. His body was sent to the Coimbatore Medical College Medical (CMCH) for post-mortem.

Similarly, N Chandru, 25, a resident of Nammakal, died after he fell from his vehicle near Kovilpalayam on the city outskirts around 10pm on Tuesday. As he did not wear helmet, he sustained severe injuries on head. Commuters took him to a nearly private hospital where he died without responding to the treatment.

Last year, three people died in road accidents on Thadagam Road and Sundakamuthur bypass during the celebrations, thus crushing the police’s hope of having a fatal-free New Year celebration for the third consecutive year.

67,['2/01/2020'],"Over 16,000 beneficiaries skip mustering process","This story is from January 2, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Over 16,000 beneficiaries of social welfare pension did not turn up for mustering process, which was conducted by city corporation as part of statewide verification of the identities of pension recipients and to filter out ineligible beneficiaries.

As per data with the corporation, as on Tuesday, which was the last date for mustering process, 70,975 beneficiaries completed mustering process while 16,222 beneficiaries skipped it. There are a total of 87,197 beneficiaries for five types of social welfare pension. The two-month long process was conducted by the corporation after the state government mandated that mustering is essential for all kinds of pension, in addition to furnishing relevant certificates.

The mustering process is mainly aimed at verifying life certificates of pension beneficiaries and linking these certificates with Aadhaar cards. The separate list of beneficiaries who attended mustering process shows that nearly 10,000 beneficiaries who receive old age pension did not attend mustering.

“They may not be alive, some of them may be bed-ridden and there could even be cases in which their relatives would be receiving the pension. We have to verify why these many beneficiaries did not attend the mustering process. We would try to make sure by all means that whoever is eligible for welfare pension do not get omitted from the list,” said S S Sindhu, chairperson, welfare standing committee.

In case of disbursal of widow pension, 24,191 beneficiaries completed mustering process out of the total of 28,277 beneficiaries. Owing to the presence of ineligible beneficiaries under widow pension, the state government has recently mandated beneficiaries to produce self-attested certificates annually, proving that they haven’t got remarried. The condition was also made applicable for beneficiaries of pension for unmarried women below the age of 60.

With 16,222 beneficiaries not turning up for mustering, corporation could redirect over Rs 1 crore as pension amount for eligible beneficiaries. The officials said that even for the bed-ridden patients who were receiving welfare pension, provisions were made for conducting mustering at their homes. Those who were not able to register their bio-metric data due to old age were issued forms certifying that mustering had failed and alternative arrangements were done for such people, said Sindhu.

“The beneficiaries who did not attend mustering process could also include persons who are ineligible for welfare pension. That might be the reason why they skipped the process,” said an official.

Indore: The plunge in temperature has lifted demand for dry fruits in local markets negating the impact of higher prices with traders anticipating a growth of over 5 -8 per cent in sales in coming months.

The rates have risen by around Rs 50 per kg to Rs 100 per kg for past a month owing to a jump in demand in winters, the peak season for dry fruits consumption, said traders.

Amongst all, prices of dry dates have shot up the most by close to 50 per cent due to encouraging demand amid restricted supplies. Dry dates are being sold at Rs 140 per kg to Rs 150 per kg as against Rs 40 per kg to Rs 70 per kg earlier.

Dry dates were originally imported from Pakistan to cater to the local needs but after restriction on imports, supplies have been limited from alternative origins such as Iran and Afghanistan.

Prateek Tiwari, a date seller from the wholesale Siyaganj market said, “Prices of dry dates have jumped multi-fold this winter because supplies are not as smooth as earlier besides demand has also grown mainly amongst lower income class.”

The daily arrivals of dry dates from Pakistan were about 320 quintals in Siyaganj Wholesale Kirana Market which has reduced to negligible.

Demand for dates have also gone up and the premium variety from Saudi Arab is being sold in the range of Rs 1,500 per kg to Rs 3,000 per kg.

Ramesh Khandelwal, president, Siyaganj Wholesale Kirana Merchant Association said, “This winter looks good as most dry fruits and species are doing good business. Prices have gone up and demand is rising with the dip in temperature.”

Figs, raisins, apricot, pistachio, and cashews are most in demand this season, traders said.

COIMBATORE: The city police arrested a 43-year-old man after he robbed a 65-year-old woman of her gold ornaments weighing 7.5 sovereign and other belongings at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) on Tuesday.

Police identified the accused as M Krishnakumar, a resident of Sundarapuram. “The accused noticed G Palaniammal alone at the hospital. He initiated a conversation with her and told her that the government is assisting senior citizens to meet out their medical expenses upon submitting an application form. Before meeting a doctor to get a form, he told her to remove her ornaments as the doctor may suspect her to be wealthy,” a police officer said.

Believing the accused, Palaniammal handed over her ornaments, a mobile phone and Rs 200 to him and went to see the doctor, the officer said. “When she came back, the accused had escaped with the items.”

Realising that she had been duped, Palaniammal informed her son G Mohanasundaram. He came to the hospital, took her to the Race Course police station and lodged a complaint.

Based on the complaint, the police traced the accused and arrested him on the same day. Later, he was produced before a judicial magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody.

Thiruvananthapuram: Dismissing the stand of CPM central leadership, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan defended the slapping of UAPA against the two college students of Pantheerankavu in Kozhikode on alleged Maoist links . He told reporters on Wednesday that Allan Shuhaib and Thwaha Fasal were not arrested by police when they were having a cup of tea.

Asserting that he doesn’t have the opinion that they (Allan and Thwaha) were saints, Vijayan said, “You might be wishing that under normal circumstances I would say slapping UAPA (on them) was a big mistake. I am not saying that. I stand by my earlier position that I don’t have the opinion that they were not involved in such activities.”

When reminded of his earlier promise to the party that the case would be reviewed by Justice P S Gopinathan commission constituted by the state government, the CM said such a situation hasn’t arisen in this case.

“That is during filing of chargesheet. Here, we didn’t reach that phase. They (NIA) have taken over before that. They can take over the case at any phase. That is what the law suggests,” said the CM, who didn’t forget to claim that like his party he also is a critic of UAPA.

In further defence of the police under the home department which he himself handles, Vijayan said there were several other instances under the LDF rule when UAPA was invoked against the accused.

Meanwhile, Sabitha Shekhar, mother of Allan Shuhaib, penned a touching note for her son on New Year’s day. After mentioning about the moderate New Year celebrations she had with her friends and students, Sabitha tells Allan that no government can jail his thoughts though they can incarcerate him physically. “All regimes create dictators. Their egos incarcerate innocents. If we examine history, (we will find that) the end of all dictators was tragic. So, Allan, wait patiently. Our time will come,” said Sabitha in the note shared on her Facebook page.

Dehradun: After losing all three games in the ongoing Ranji Trophy tournament, the Cricket Association of Uttarakhand (CAU) has made some major changes in the Uttarakhand squad.

Team captain Unmukt Chand has been relieved from his captaincy duties and his deputy Tanmay Srivastava will now lead the side for the remaining season.

The Uttarakhand team is having a bad time in the current Ranji season. In the three matches that the team has played till now, Uttarakhand lost by 253 runs against Jammu and Kashmir while the team lost an innings against Chhattisgarh. In the last game of the year, Uttarakhand lost by 10 wickets against Odisha.

Chand had the highest score of 24 against Chhattisgarh and got dismissed thrice in single-digits. The former India U-19 captain hasn’t had a smooth domestic season as he missed out the entire Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy due to an injury.

Srivastava scored 116 runs in three games and scored a half-century in the second innings against Chhattisgarh. Srivastava also got dismissed thrice at single-digit scores in the six innings he played.

Meanwhile, the selectors have dropped batsmen Karanveer Kaushal and Avneesh Sudha from the squad. Both of them have been replaced by stand-by players Piyush Joshi and Harshit Bisht.

Thiruvananthapuram: In an attempt to resolve the issues faced by members of the transgender community such as violation of rights and denial of justice, the Kerala state youth commission will organize a state-level adalat on January 10.

The special hearing, exclusively for transgender community, is a first of its kind initiative in the state. The aim of the adalat is to find solutions to the complaints of transgender persons regarding exploitation they face at home, workplace and in the society.

The adalat will be led by youth commission chairperson Chintha Jerome and will begin at 11am on January 10 at the conference hall of Government Guest House in Thycaud.

The aim of the adalat is to provide a platform where they can express their concerns without fear.

Complaints and suggestions are invited from transgender persons aged between 18 and 40 years. For further details contact: 0471-2308630.

Officials in youth commission said that many transgender persons keep away from filing complaints fearing the hostile environment in police stations. The initiative by the commission is to address this gap.

“Despite having legal protection and support of the government, a section of transgender people still complain about ill treatment from the society. There are complaints that transgender people are treated as second grade citizens even in government offices where they approach for different services,” said an official.

Panaji: The NRI commission of Goa has not received any cases from Portuguese citizens over their citizenship status in the wake of the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), commissioner for NRI affairs Narendra Sawaikar said on Wednesday.

“Most of them are registered as overseas citizens of India (OCI), which give them all the rights. In fact they should not worry. CAA will not have any effect on those people because they’re registered as OCIs. Therefore there should not be any problem,” he told reporters.

A large number of Goans have voluntarily surrendered their Indian citizenship for Portuguese citizenship for better job and educational prospects abroad. The Portuguese passport became all the more alluring after Portugal joined the European Union (EU), giving citizens easy access to EU countries, especially the UK .

Coimbatore: Industrial associations in the district have decided to expedite industrial estate projects in 2020.

While the Coimbatore Gold Jewellery Cluster, which will have modern facilities to make gold jewellery, is expected to be operational by August, other industrial associations are also getting ready to start construction and finish their projects this year.

Members of the Coimbatore Sidco Industrial Estate Manufacturers Welfare Association (Cosiema) are working on land registration process for the industrial estate at Kinathukkadavu. Representatives said they have completed the process for the 42-acre plot. Land survey is under way.

“Once the survey is complete and the boundaries are marked, we would approach the State and the Centre for infrastructure subsidy,” said S Surulivel, former president of Cosiema and current state vice-president of Lagu Udhyog Bharati. “We hope to get Rs 10crore fund and also infrastructure subsidy from the State. Construction is likely to start by March or April. The estate will focus on expansion projects of the industrial units at the Sidco Industrial Estate in Kurichi.”

Meanwhile, work on the Nethaji Industrial Estate at Devanampalayam village at Sarkar Samakulam is also progressing fast. Representatives have decided to handover the land to the members this year.

Secretary of the Nethaji Industrial Estate Society P Soundararajan said they had applied for infrastructure subsidy six months ago. “The procedure is yet to be completed. We are also planning to start the project by our own if it gets more delayed,” he added.

Thiruvananthapuram: The third-year MBBS students of SR Medical College and Research Centre at Akathumuri near Varkala have requested the state government to cancel the university examinations of the third-year regular batch, which is scheduled to be commence on January 10.

In a news conference called by the SR Medical College Action Council on Wednesday, the students and their parents alleged that even after the Union ministry of health directed the state government to withdraw the essentiality certificate (EC) of the college and directed to shift the students to other medical colleges across the state, the Kerala University of Health Sciences (KUHS) is turning a blind eye to the order.

It was on December 27, citing poor facilities and lack of faculties and patients at the SR Medical College, that the medical education wing of ministry of health and family welfare issued an order directing the state government to cancel the EC and to send a proposal for shifting the students.

Simi B, a parent said that though the Centre’s intervention was a relief to the students, the silence of KUHS is a reason for worry.

“At a time when the ministry had asked the government to take immediate steps to shift the students, KUHS has announced the examination dates for the regular batch and asked to pay the examination fee and the management started collecting fees. The management also threatens the students that there won’t be any shifting and also announced that Rs 300 will be imposed as fine if they refuse to pay the examination fee. It seems that the university is supporting the college management by conducting the examination which is not a right move,” said Simi.

The students have sought immediate intervention of the state government in this regard. “We have not received a single class for third-year subjects that include ophthalmology and ENT. We have not seen any patient this year. There is another group of students who support the management and is ready to write the exams. How can we call one a doctor if he/she lacks practical knowledge? KUHS should take immediate steps in shifting us to other medical colleges and cancel the announced examinations,” said Shehin S S, a third-year student.

78,['2/01/2020'],Passengers say nominal train fare hike no cause for worry,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Coimbatore: Effective from January 1 , any ticket to Chennai on an airconditioned coach from the city will cost Rs 20 more. Tickets on non-AC coaches will costRs 10 more.

This comes after the Indian Railways announced a blanket increase in fares of four paise per kilometre for the AC class, one paisa for ordinary non-suburban classes and two paise for non-AC mail/express trains.

Those who travel to Chennai from Coimbatore on the Nilgiris Express’ sleeper class spending Rs 265 will have to shell out Rs 10 more from now on. The fares for the AC classes, which ranges from Rs 815 to Rs 1,940, will increase by Rs Rs 20. “For a family of six, the total fare will go up by Rs 60 to Rs 120,” said a railway official.

Fares from Coimbatore to Delhi, which range from Rs Rs 820 on a sleeper class to Rs 3,245 on an AC second class, will increase by Rs 53.5 and Rs 107 respectively. “For a six-member family, the increase will be Rs 300 to Rs Rs 600,” the official said.

Frequent rail passengers, who were initially worried about the impending increase in fares, heaved a sigh of relief after the announcement on Sunday. “The fact that it does not apply to season tickets and suburban rail travellers is a relief,” said T Arunachalam, a regular traveller. “ I think with the cost of so many essentials, including vegetables increasing, a hike of Rs 4 to Rs 6 for a train I take every week is reasonable.”

Rail activists said the hike is justified, especially after five years. “No doubt, it may affect a poor family, but overall, the increase is reasonable and hardly costs Rs 10 to Rs 15 for most trains within South India and the state,” said B Mohanraj of the Pollachi Rail passengers Welfare Association.

However, former division rail users committee member and member of Parliament P R Natrajan said the hike is an additional burden on the people, who are already reeling under job losses and a bad economy. “We are further burdening the poor, who are facing inflation in all other streams and job losses. So, every paisa counts. The hike should be withdrawn,” he added.

Erode: Public works department officials and residents of Perumugai village near Gobichettipalayam in Erode district stopped seepage from a lake after an eight-hour operation.

Around 9pm on Tuesday, a few residents of the village noticed water seeping from Sanjeevirayan lake spread over 100 acres. “The flow was increasing continously. If it had continued, five villages including Anna Nagar, Varapallam and Sybanpudur as well as 200 acres of fertile lands would be submerged,” C Mathivanan, a villager, said.

The lake was recently desilted under the Kudimaramathu scheme. “It was about 36ft deep. Water reaching the lake was already diverted to nearby canals for irrigation purposes,” a PWD official said.

After being alerted, the PWD officials reached the spot and tried to place sand bags to prevent seepage at the breached spot. They used earthmovers to fill sand to strengthen the bund wall. Andhiyur legislator Rajam Krishnan also reached the spot and monitored the work. After eight hours, water seepage was finally stopped.

Tirupur: A 49-year-old man was killed near Avinashi in the district on Tuesday after one of his neighbours pushed him down during a quarrel.

Rajendran R of S Mettupalayam in Avinashi taluk was working as a painter and his 15-year-old son was studying Class XI in a school nearby. On Tuesday, the boy was riding Rajendran’s motorcycle. He lost control of it when he was speeding and hit his neighbour’s dog, which was killed on the spot, a policer officer said.

When M Saminathan, 42, a driver, was informed of his pet’s death, he confronted the boy and scolded him. Irked Rajendran intervened on his son side and an argument ensued. At a point, Saminathan pushed Rajendran down. Rajendran suffered severe head injuries and lost his consciousness, the officer said.

Rajendran was rushed to the Avinashi government hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead. The Avinashi police registered a case and arrested Saminathan. He was later lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison.

10 former Congress MLAs had joined BJP mid-2019

PANAJI: Congress on Wednesday requested speaker Rajesh Patnekar to decide on the disqualification petition filed against 10 former Congress MLAs who joined BJP mid-2019.

State Congress president Girish Chodankar said the delay in deciding the disqualification petition defeats the purpose of the anti-defection law. “It is submitted that justice delayed is justice denied, and in the present case, the delay caused in delivery of justice is giving undue and undeserving benefit to the respondents to illegally continue as members of the legislative assembly,” said Chodankar in his application for expeditious disposal of the disqualification petition.

Former opposition leader Chandrakant Kavalekar, Isidore Fernandes, Nilkanth Halarnkar, Jennifer Monserrate, Antonio Fernandes, Francisco Silveira, Wilfred Dsa, Clafasio Dias, Filipe Rodrigues and Antanasio Monserrate broke away from Congress and joined BJP en masse without resigning as MLAs.

Subsequently, Congress filed disqualification petitions before the speaker of the House under Article 191(2) of the Constitution of India and Schedule X, seeking that the 10 MLAs had incurred disqualification by joining the BJP.

Patnekar held a preliminary hearing on October 15, where the Congress put forth its stand. Since then, Patnekar has not held any other hearings on the matter.

Chodankar says that there has been no “meaningful progress” in the disqualification proceedings and “adjudication in the matter is being unreasonably delayed” by Patnekar, who is from the BJP camp.

PATNA: Bihar will not be represented in the Republic Day parade at Janpath in New Delhi on January 26. Officials at Bihar Information Centre in Delhi said though the Centre appreciated the state government’s theme of Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Mission proposed for its tableau, but refused to showcase it in the Republic Day parade because “it does not fulfil the criteria for that”. Bihar was not included in the R-Day parade in 2019 as well.

“As the state government is working on the ambitious JJH Mission, which is one of a kind initiative to tackle climate change and water conservation, it was proposed as our theme for Bihar’s tableau in national R-Day parade. We had submitted a proposal in this regard to the defence ministry in September. But the ministry later claimed that as per the set criteria for Republic Day parade, state governments cannot make their tableaux on such a theme,” a senior official at Bihar Information Centre said.

Sources said the selection committee under the defence ministry has set stringent criteria for selecting tableaux for R-Day parade. According to sources, the entries sent by states have to pass three rounds of scrutiny by the selection committee. The broad parameters for evaluating the themes proposed by the states include international branding, national integration and aesthetic value.

“Even though the selection committee appreciated our theme and the state government’s endeavours under the JJH Mission, it turned down our proposal for showcasing the same in the R-Day parade,” he said and added that Bihar government had proposed prohibition as the theme for its tableau in 2019 but it was also rejected for similar reasons.

Officials said the last time Bihar featured in the R-Day parade in Delhi was in 2015 when its tableau was based on the celebrations of 100 years of Mahatma Gandhi’s Champaran Satyagraha. Prior to that, the theme for Bihar’s tableau in 2013 was ‘Mithila ka Sikki art’. Sikki is a traditional folk craft of Mithila region. In 2012, the theme for Bihar’s tableau was ‘Dharhara Ki Beti’. Dharhara is a village in Bhagalpur district. It is famous for its tradition of planting of trees by families on the birth of a girl child.

T’puram: The failure of police in identifying the car involved a hit-and-run case at Vellayambalam three days ago has invited the criticism of the Kerala state human rights commission (KSHRC).

Commission chairman Justice Antony Dominic on Wednesday directed the city police commissioner to file a report on conditions of the cameras in the surveillance camera network of the police in the city within four weeks.

On Sunday night, an online food delivery executive, Abdul Rahim, was killed after he was knocked down by a speeding car. Another person, who sustained serious injuries in the accident, is still under treatment. The police are yet to identify the car. They claim that the cameras in the proximity could not capture visuals that could help identify the car that caused the accident.

KSHRC has intervened in the issue after receiving a petition in this regard from a city resident, Ajithkumar of Vazhuthacaud. The petitioner alleged that the accident occurred near high security zone that housed the official residences of the governor and ministers. Hence it is highly unlikely for the cameras in the zone to be dysfunctional. tnn

Allahabad: Bright sunshine on the last day of the year brought much-needed relief to city residents who have been bearing the brunt of winter chill for last two days.

The city woke up to a hazy and foggy skyline on Tuesday but sunshine later in the day brought smiles to the faces of people who came out to enjoy the New Year eve at restaurants and public places.

The minimum temperature was recorded at 5.8 degrees Celsius while maximum temperature stood at 13.8 degrees Celsius, up by 2.9 degrees and 5.2 degrees Celsius, respectively.

The coldest day of the season was recorded at 2.9 degrees Celsius on Monday.

Met officials, however, said people would not get much relief from the chill for next few days as existing weather conditions could be attributed to rising relative humidity and icy winds coming from western region.

Meanwhile, fog continued to affect railway operations on Tuesday as many trains arrived and departed late.

Kunal Sharma, a resident of Civil Lines said, “Bright sunshine brought a major relief for people after a gap of two days. We enjoyed the last day of the year with our families.”

Anjali of Rajapur area said, “After I saw bright sunshine during afternoon hours, I decided to take my children to park and enjoy the last day of the year.”

KOLKATA: The number of people caught driving drunk on VIP Road and at Chinar Park and Sector V far exceeded the figure in entire Kolkata on the intervening night of December 31 and January 1 with cops from the Bidhannagar commissionerate booking 317 motorists and bikers. In Kolkata, 188 were booked on the night of revelry.“This year, we were determined to ensure no accident took place on the year-end festive night, especially owing to drink-driving. Hence, we had set up checkpoints and nakas at all major entry and exit points, along with main junctions near party zones and bars in our jurisdiction. The move yielded results and we booked 317 people just for driving or riding drunk. This strict checking ensured that not even a single accident took place in our area,” said Kunal Agarwal, joint commissioner (headquarters) of Bidhannagar commissionerate.More than 2,000 cops from the Bidhannagar City Police got down on the roads around 8pm on Tuesday and their drive continued till 4am on Wednesday. Not only senior officers in the rank of deputy commissioner and additional commissioner but also Agarwal himself and even Bidhannagar commissioner L N Meena patrolled the roads. The only instance of trouble was recorded at a private party for which, a venue at Eco Park was rented. The organisers reportedly ran out of food and liquor, leading to a brawl. Cops had to intervene and bring the situation under control.Last year, the crackdown figures in Bidhannagar were much lower, with 169 people being booked for drink-driving and a total of 274 people were booked for different offences. This year, the total number of offenders jumped to 544. In Kolkata last year, 267 people were arrested for different offences, 182 for drink-driving. This year in Kolkata, the total number of people arrested for drink driving remained almost the same, but the total number shot up to 1,305. Of them, 863 people were booked for disorderly conduct. Lalbazar officers pointed out the number of people arrested for disorderly conduct, which included teasing, molestation, brawl, unruly behaviour and creating disturbance in a drunken state, increased almost three times the count of 267 recorded on December 31, 2018.“Most of the incidents of disorderly conduct were reported in pockets of south Kolkata. But none of the incidents was serious enough to attract specific charges. The only serious incident was that of a molestation at Dorina crossing, for which we have started a case at the New Market police station,” said an officer.

Representative image

MUMBAI: As mental health gains focus in schools and counsellors become a part of staff rooms, some schools are going a step ahead to break the stigma attached to it.

To ensure students do not feel akward walking into the counsellor's office, a few schools in the city now dedicate a session each week where the counsellor, like any other subject teacher, comes to a classroom to discuss issues which are otherwise are often brushed under the carpet.

Five schools in the city and Thane managed by Goenka and Associate Educational Trust have a weekly period called classroom counselling. “Professionally qualified psychologists go to a class and discuss age-appropriate mental health topics with students. Topics could range from eating healthy for a healthy mind to suicide, sexuality and relationships. We now have a lot more students speaking to our counsellors about their troubles in personal life as well. It helps identify a problem and helps the child at the right time,” said Meera Kothari, counselling director at the schools. The schools have a counselling centre and have dedicated personnel for each section.

A similar model has been highly successful at Aditya Birla Education Trust’s institutions, said child and adolescent psychiatrist Zirak Marker, who is attached to the school. “There is a need to normalise mental health issues. There is still a fear of being labelled if a student is seen going to the counsellor’s office. So why not bring the counsellors to the classroom? There must be a few periods each week when like all other subjects, the counsellor speaks to the children and teaches them coping mechanisms, resilience or emotions. Then it would not be difficult for students to approach the counsellor,” he said at a recent panel discussion.

While not all have inhouse counselling available for students, schools look at professionals to outsource demand. iCall, the helpline run by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, recently tied up with Billabong High International Schools. “It can often be difficult to open up about thoughts because of the fear of being judged or isolated. We provide a supportive and non-judgemental space for anyone who is feeling vulnerable and suicidal,” said Tanuja Babre, programme coordinator, iCall. The helpline can be accessed post-school hours by students and the service can be availed anonymously.

Thiruvananthapuram: Cooperation minister Kadakampally Surendran has said that the relevance of cooperative banking sector has increased at a time when commercial banking sector shows symptoms of weakness.

He said the cooperative sector of the state has shown its strength when the country witnessed severe crisis after demonetization. The minister was inaugurating the deposit mobilization campaign and Navakeraleeyam default settlement schemes in cooperative banks in the state.

He said the government aims to strengthen the cooperative sector with the setting up of the Kerala Bank. The aim of Kerala Bank is to mobilize Rs 3 lakh crore in two years. This money will be utilized for the development of the cooperative sector in the state.

The deposit mobilization drive will continue till February last across the state. Through this campaign, the government aims to mobilize at least Rs 6,000 crore from across the state.

Navakeraleeyam scheme provides an opportunity for defaulters to settle the loan arrears by making one-time payment. Loans given by all cooperative banks and societies under cooperation registrar will be covered by the scheme. There will be special concessions for loans availed for medical treatment. MLA V Joy, cooperation department secretary Mini Antony and cooperation registrar P K Jayasree spoke at the event.

Nagpur: 66-year-old Kishor Wankhade and his three young friends of nature from Wardha will cycle over 800km to attend the 33rd ‘pakshimitra sammelan’ (birders’ meet) at Revdanda in Alibagh district.

Wankhade and his likes could have preferred a vehicle to attend the two-day state level meet beginning January 11, but the bird watchers have a message to save environment in birding interest.

The sammelan will be opened by well-known bird expert and author Raju Kasambe. It will be attended by many experts, bird lovers and amateur bird watchers from the country.

“Even at 66, I’ve not left the ground. I’m still into cycling, playing sports, running, walking and all sorts of physical activities that keep me fit,” says Wankhade, who is also president of Bahar Nature Foundation (BNF), Wardha.

Other three members of Bahar — Dilip Virkhade, Deepak Gudhekar and Darshan Dudhane — will join Wankhade. The group will leave Wardha on January 4 and reach Alibagh in 7 days on January 10, which means they will cover a distance of over 100km every day.

Wankhade said, “Last year too, I rode 850km to attend a similar state-level birders’ meet in Karad. I started attending these meets on cycle three years ago, basically to send a message that cycle was the most environment-friendly mode of transport and clean substitute for fossil fuels.”

Earlier, Wankhade has attended similar meets in Vidarbha on cycle. The group will also meet forest minister in Mumbai and demand to declare November 5 to 12, as ‘Pakshi Saptah’ (bird week) to commemorate the birthdays of two renowned ornithologists from India — Dr Salim Ali (November 12) and Maruti Chitampalli (November 5).

To a question how cycling will help conserve birds, Virkhade said, “The message is to save nature. If it is saved, birds will automatically be. Not only this, cycling has many health benefits. On way, many people including media men meet us and help promote the message of saving environment by promoting cycling.”

The police also said that primary evidence collected from the scene did not suggest involvement of any other vehicles in the accident.

His body was released to the family for funeral after conducting post-mortem examination.

SECUNDERABAD: South Central Railway (SCR) is aiming to increase the number of Diesel Electric Multiple Unit trains and passenger trains from and to the Malkajgiri railway station . The vision is to develop it as a model railway station on the lines of Lingampalli railway station, said officials. The move would also help in decongesting the Secunderabad-Kacheguda stations, they said.

The new facilities at the Malkajgiri railway station that will make it more passenger-friendly include booking offices, waiting halls, foot over bridge and a circulating area.

“A number of trains travelling to Maharashtran and other parts of Telangana halt here. Over the time, we have observed a rise in demand and need for more trains to be halted at Malkajgiri such as Rayalaseema Express, Sampark Kranthi and Devagiri Expresses. Though close to 20 express trains pass through the station, only 10 halt here,"" said an SCR official.

Meanwhile, citizens on Twitter under the hashtag #AskKTR are demanding to know when the MMTS trains between Bolarum and Secunderabad will start running.

This request for MMTS service also found support from railway unions and suburban train and bus travellers association who have requested railway authorities to run MMTS trains on the said route.

Despite electrification work being completed in the Bolarum and Secunderabad MMTS section in February last year, SCR is unable to run MMTS trains as the fund share by the state government is still pending.

“The extended train services from the station will provide direct rail connectivity to Malkajgiri residents and its surrounding areas to reach Hitec City, Lingampalli, Patancheru , Falaknuma and other suburban areas at an economical price,” an SCR official added.

SECUNDERABAD: Issues such as water shortage and improper drainage may well be a thing of the past in Secunderabad cantonment area with the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut), now being extended to civilian areas under the Secunderabad Cantonment Board .

The central government sponsored scheme focuses on providing basic amenities such as water supply, sanitation, sewerage and development of green cover and open spaces in urban areas in the country.

According to official communiqué from the ministry of urban development ( MUD ), the Amrut scheme has been extended to all Cantonment Boards, including civilian areas, apart from cities, towns and notified municipalities in the country.

“The corresponding state share shall be borne by the Cantonments out of their own resources,” the official communiqué read.

Cantonment residents are hopeful that with the advent of this scheme, issues related to water supply will be solved as supply of potable water to every household is a salient feature of Amrut scheme. Residents said that only 55 per cent of Cantonment area receives adequate water at an average of five days a week.

The inclusion of residential areas under the scheme is a good sign as every household will be able to get potable water, said a senior SCB official from the water department. Officials are also hopeful that the Amrut scheme will provide much-needed relief to the areas with poor drainage system. As the sewage system in SCB is several decades-old, the low-lying areas are inundated every year drying monsoon .

“As the scheme focuses on infrastructure creation there is a direct link to provision of better services to citizens”, an official said.

Welcoming the move a senior BJP leader in Secunderabad Cantonment said, “It is unfortunate that the SCB stands as the worst performer among cantonment boards in the latest results of Swachh Survekshan League 2020 by the central government. Hopefully this central scheme may help to improve the situation.”

Representative image

PANAJI: Your power bills are likely to get heftier in April, with the electricity department proposing a tariff hike of 3.84 %.

""The electricity department has proposed a tariff hike of 3.84 % for FY 2020-2021,"" the department stated in its tariff petition submitted to the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission.

After a public hearing, the commission will decide on the government's proposal.

The department, in its proposed tariff structure is looking at cumulatively billing low-tension consumers at a uniform rate for their entire power consumption, instead of the present staggered slab rate billing. The new tariff structure has been proposed for low-tension domestic, commercial and industries categories of consumers.

All low-tension domestic consumers, whose consumption is more than 200 units, shall lose the benefit of the cheaper unit fares of the first two slabs (0-100 and 101-200 units). Total monthly consumption of more than 200 units shall fall in the respective slab and accordingly, applicable energy charges for that respective slab will be levied,"" the department has stated.

Currently, low-tension domestic consumers are charged Rs 1.40 per unit for consumption up to 100 units, Rs 2.20 per unit for consumption up to 200 units, Rs 2.65 per unit for consumption up to 300 units and Rs 3.45 per unit up to 400 units and Rs 4 per unit for above units.

Similarly, the department has proposed that low-tension commercial consumers, whose consumption is beyond 100 units lose the benefit of the first slab and low-tension industries whose consumption is beyond 500 units lose the benefit of the first 500 units for the energy charges.

""Along with the above non- telescopic approach for categories of consumers where slab-wise tariff is applicable, the power department proposed to meet their partial revenue gap through a tariff hike, and the remaining through budgetary support,"" the department stated.

The department has computed a revenue gap of Rs 242.68 crore for the financial year 2020-2021.

There was no power tariff hike proposed by the department for the financial year 2019-2020, where the department informed JERC that it would meet the revenue gap of Rs 308 crore through the state government’s budgetary support. JERC had highlighted the department’s “over-reliance” on budgetary support at the time.

Coimbatore: Graduate social science teachers from government and government-aided schools, who teach for students up to Class X, say those of them who have studied both UG and PG in history or geography, have been losing out PG promotions to those teachers who have done cross majors.

They said as PG courses in history and geography do not insist that candidates should be from social science backgrounds, teachers who have completed UG in other subjects such as language or science do PG in social sciences. It is to these candidates that those who have done purely social sciences have been losing out, they said.

Graduate social science teachers said about 3,000 of them have been affected due to this across the state.

K P Sekar, a graduate social science teacher at a government-aide school from the district, said they have not been getting proper promotions for around 4 to 5 years now. “Graduate social science teachers have not been getting proper promotions. Cross major people are eating away into our opportunities,” he said and added that the issue was also represented in the court.

T Arulanandam, a representative of the Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers Association, said the state should fix a ratio for PG promotions in social science teachers. “There should be a ratio of say, 1:1, meaning if there are 50 PG promotion posts for social sciences, the state should give opportunity for 25 pure social science graduates and equal number of cross majors, so that there would be fair play,” he said.

Graduate social science teachers also said at present they have only five classes per week for Class X. But the new syllabus had 27 chapters across history, geography, civics and economics. They said this calls for more hours and sought seven social science hours per week.

The association members had represented these issues to the commissioner of school education recently.

HYDERABAD: As police fanned out across the state with breath analysers, 3,158 drunk driving cases were booked in Telangana on the intervening night of December 31 and January 1. Madhapur police station in the IT corridor logged maximum number of drunk driving cases (192) in the state.

We could not conduct breath analyser test, but pillion rider’s BAC level was almost 300mg/100ml,” said Madhapur traffic inspector, Rajagopal Reddy.

103,['2/01/2020'],Anti-CAA protests hit power loom units,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Erode: The owners of power loom units across the district have shut down their business since Monday as they were not able to send cloth material for dyeing process to Surat, Ahmedabad, Faizabad and Jaipur due to ongoing protests and violence against CAA and NRC in north India.

The owners have decided to keep the units shut for a few weeks until normalcy resumes in north India.

“Due to continuous protests and violence in north India, we could not send our cloth materials for dyeing. This has resulted in piling up of huge stock of cloth materials in power loom units across the district,” spokesperson of Erode district power loom owners association (EPOA) B Kandavel told TOI.

More than 60,000 power looms are functioning in Chithode, Lakkapuram, Modakkuruchi, Chennimalai, Vellode in Erode district. Nearly 50 lakh metres of cloth materials are produced by these looms every day. More than 20,000 weavers are employed directly in these units while thousands get jobs indirectly.

Dyeing units in Surat, Ahmedabad, Faizabad and Jaipur charge less for dyeing process when compared with units in Namakkal, Erode and surrounding districts.

“We get Rs 30 profit per metre if we send our cloths to these north Indian cities for dyeing after transportation and loading and unloading expenses,” Kandavel said.

Four weeks ago, the power loom unit owners had sent 16 lakh metres of cloth materials to these cities for dyeing process. “We have not received information about the status of 7 lakh metres of materials. We don’t know whether the material is safe or damaged in the violence,” Kandavel said.

Fearing over this, the owners have started to halt their business to avoid loss.

Sarath Yadav of Aditya Dyeing and Printing Mills Private Limited, Surat in Gujarat, told TOI that the entire dyeing units in Surat were closed for the last three weeks following continuous protests over CAA and NRC. “We could not carry out dyeing process due to the fear that protesters may damage the fabrics,” he said. “I don’t know when the situation would improve,” he added.

Meanwhile, the viscose rayon yarn manufacturers have reduced the yarn rate to avoid stocks in their units.

Secretary of Chithode Power Loom Owners Association (CPOA) K Balasubramani said viscose rayon yarn was sold for Rs 220/kg about a month ago. “It is available for Rs145/kg this week,” he said. Due to sudden drop in the yarn price, the power loom owners are struggling to fix price for their produces.

It will take at least 15 days to get the finished product. If a power loom owner bought one kilo of yarn for Rs 220, he will sell the finished product from that rate for profit. When the yarn rate is being reduced, the cloth buyers will expect the loom owner to sell their produce for cheaper rate instead of higher price.

“We are trying our best to avoid huge loss as every power loom owner will be facing at least Rs 400 loss per day per power loom machine,” Balasubramani added.

Usually, all the power loom units will be busy especially during Diwali and Pongal festivals. But, this year it was not so. “About 90% of the units stopped their production since Monday,” Balasubramani said, adding that remaining 10% of units will be closed in a couple of days as they have Tamil Nadu government’s free dhotis and sari orders.

The shutting down of power loom units have affected thousands of weavers as they have not got their wages for the past two weeks. “We will be paid maximum of Rs 550 per day. But, the unit owners are now ready to pay only Rs 250 as wage, citing their production loss,” A T Kumaresan, a weaver from Lakkapuram, said.

The weavers have been asked not to come to work till they were called for. “Many of our owners have asked us to look for some other jobs,” Kumaresan said, adding that the government should take some step to save the weavers and their families at the earliest.

Panaji: Congress on Wednesday alleged that Mormugao Port Trust ( MPT ) officials and urban development minister Milind Naik had colluded to sell 2,400 tonnes of contaminated naphtha to Mumbai-based United Futuristic Trade Impex (UFTI) Pvt Ltd at a price lower than the value of the consignment. United Futuristic purchased the chemical for Rs 36 lakh, the base price set at the auction conducted by MSTC limited (formerly known as Metal Scrap Trade Corporation Limited). State Congress vice-president Sankalp Amonkar called for an investigation into the auction process. “Naphtha worth Rs 15 crore was sold for Rs 36 lakh and this is for selfish interests,” he said, adding that the naphtha aboard Nu Shi Nalini was pure and not contaminated. A letter dated October 25 issued by the office of the commissioner of customs clearly states contaminated naphtha while giving permission for removal of the cargo from Nu-Shi Nalini.

Roorkee: Roorkee Police on Wednesday arrested two members of a local auto-lifter gang and recovered 16 stolen motorcycles from them.

According to Gangnahar Police, a team led by sub-inspector Nitesh Sharma was patrolling on Tuesday night when it came across two motorcycles approaching the Saliyar check post in Roorkee. When the bikes were stopped, the pillion rider on one of the two-wheelers got off and fled.

In-charge of Gangnahar police station Rajesh Sah said, “The rest of the men on the bikes failed to show their documents. We brought them to the police station, where they confessed to being auto lifters.” The criminals are masons by profession and have been stealing bike for the last one year, said police. “The accused used to target ‘Splendor’ model of Hero bikes, as the locks of these are easy to break.

106,['2/01/2020'],Will ban on single-use plastic items end up being a farce?,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Merchants were seen using banned plastic carry bags on Wednesday

KOCHI: On paper, single-use plastic has been banned from January 1. But on the ground, shopkeepers across the city sold items in plastic carry bags, all below 50 microns, on the first day. And buyers had no reluctance in carrying these plastic bags.

This is mainly because Kochi corporation is yet to take stringent action to ensure proper enforcement of the ban . “We had given strict instructions to the corporation officials to take stringent action against those selling plastic carry bags below 50 microns. We had instructed the corporation secretary to delegate the powers to slap fine on the violators a week ago. Still, the order delegating the powers of the secretary, to slap fine on the offenders, to the health inspectors is yet to be issued,” said corporation health standing committee chairperson Prathibha Anzari. Had the powers been delegated to the health inspectors, they would be able to complete the procedures during the drive against banned plastic. Once a person is caught red-handed, a health inspector can slap fine on him or her immediately. Otherwise, the order to slap fine should be signed by the top official who are stationed in the corporation office. This will cause a delay of at least a week to issue notice to the offender.

According to corporation officials, the draft of the order delegating secretary’s powers to fine the offenders is ready. “We will be issuing the final order on Friday. The order will be sent as WhatsApp message to all the health inspectors,” an official with the corporation said. “The drive against banned plastic objects will soon be intensified,” the official said. The corporation is planning to deploy three officials in each of the 21 circles of the local body to conduct checks.

The corporation had plans to conduct roadshows and walkathon for creating awareness among the public regarding the ban. “Health standing committee had decided to conduct roadshows. Though we requested mayor Soumini Jain to take measures to conduct the roadshow, she insisted that such programmes can be organized only after getting the approval of the council. But, the mayor hasn’t convened council meeting after December 13,” Anzari said. “Similarly, the committee had recommended the conduct of a walkathon. But the mayor said the local body would be organizing a marathon for creating awareness on the ban,” she said. The mayor and corporation secretary Anu R S were not available for comment.

Some of the textile shops in the city have started giving cotton bags to customers. “For the past six months on, we have been giving cotton bags to our customers. So, we don’t have any issue due to the ban,” an employee with a textile shop on MG Road said. At the same time, many other shops are yet to switch over to cloth bags. “All our shops in Tamil Nadu are using cotton bags. We would switch over to cotton bags if the situation warrants so. Now, we give reusable plastic bags to our customers,” said a staff of another textile shop. Banned plastic carry bags and other items are being used by grocery shops, vegetable shops, bakery shops, etc. Plates with wrapper of plastic sheets on them are used by wayside eateries to serve food.

CHENNAI: Picture this. It is 2030 and an elevator takes the visitor to a sea-view apartment on the 23rd floor at Wimco Nagar near Thiruvottiyur. The same elevator will bring the visitor to level five where she can enter the platform and board a metro train to airport.In a bid to integrate real estate and transport and generate non-ticketing revenue, Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) is planning to build a 20-storey structure above the elevated depot cum station at Wimco Nagar, now a calm locality near Thiruvottiyur and 600m away from the beach. Besides the tower, there will be a four-level parking space below the stabling lines. The depot is likely to be ready by December 2020.“It could either be a residential or an office space depending on the demand after the extension line is opened and the area develops. But it’s going to be like a satellite city. We don’t have a design for the structure yet, but we are laying the foundation for the structure now for future development,” a metro rail official said. “Right now, Koyembedu depot can handle all our 52 trains. We will need this second depot only when the trains get older and require frequent maintenance,” the official said.CMRL plans to build the high rise above the elevated depot as the need arises to generate additional revenue. Similar structures are planned in the elevated depots to come up at Madhavaram and Poonamallee as part of the 118.9km three-corridor phase-2.Wimco Nagar depot is part of the phase-1 extension line from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar with nine stations. It is likely to open in mid-2020. Since, it is an extension of the phase-1 corridor Washermenpet to Airport via Anna Salai, commuters could travel from Wimco Nagar all the way up to airport in one go without a break in journey.“People think it’s far away and don’t like settling in these localities because of the lack of access through a proper transport system. With metro, we are going to give a comfortable and a faster access. We are sure the area will develop rapidly,” an official said.The elevated depot, with 16 lines and spread over 15,500sqm is taking shape at a height of 12m. It rests on 1,161 foundation pile columns built underground and connected with a 1.8-metre-thick concrete raft above which 324 columns of varying thickness have been constructed. Provisions have been made in these columns to build four level car parking space below the depot.“It was a challenge building the foundation as the water table was as high as 2m. We had to drain it out,” an official at the construction site said. “The foundation can hold a 60m tall structure, which is about 15 to 20 floors. We are also constructing other facilities that can be used in the future when the high-rise is built,” said an official.At the depot level, there will be a small station, training facility and other amenities for the depot staff and train operators. The station, which is separate from the Wimco Nagar elevated station less than a kilometre away, could also be used by the occupants in the property developed in the future.The 16 lines at the depot, including one line for the station, are linked to the mainline proceeding towards Wimco Nagar elevated station through a 600m link corridor. A 7.5m wide internal road around the depot, storm water drains and a water tank with a capacity of six lakh litres will also be built. Another 10,000sqm area near the depot will be used to build amenities such as parking space depending on the requirement. This apart, a 1055sqm auto coach washing plant will have three-levels for property development.“We will require funds to develop these facilities. May be in the future, we will construct them on a PPP-mode as the demand goes up. We will generate revenue in the form of rents,” an official said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064607,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-826119,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/metro-rail-plans-20-storey-building-above-wimco-nagar-elevated-depot/articleshow/73062499.cms

Bhopal: The Supreme Court Monitoring Committee, set up by the apex court to keep a watch on medical facilities being provided to survivors of the 1984 Bhopal Gas Disaster, while referring to its visit to Indira Gandhi Women and Children Hospital on Sultania Road, presented a report before the Madhya Pradesh high court on December 18, 2019.

The monitoring committee said, “11 posts of medical officers and six posts of specialists, including that of radiologist, pathologist, medical and surgical specialists and blood bank officers were recommended to be filled up”. It was also recommended that posts as sanctioned should be filled up by regular channel.

It was not only a large number of vacancies of medical officers and specialists that the monitoring committee took note of, but also the fact that beds and bed sheets were also not available for indoor patients in the hospital.

The monitoring committee further recommended that the indoor patient department (IPD) be furnished by providing necessary cots/beds and the repair of damaged and useless cots/beds should be undertaken on an urgent basis. It also stated that lockers, benches and sufficient number of bed sheets be also provided.

The committee also recommended that a separate medicine distribution counter for specially-abled and senior citizens should also be opened in the hospital premises.

Following a visit to Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital, which is the first gas relief hospital in Bhopal, the monitoring committee once again underlined the need to urgently fill up the posts of specialists/ medical officers and pointed out that if the gas relief department adopted the service rules of public health and family welfare in letter and spirit, it could be done with ease.

“Service rules of the public health and family welfare department have been adopted by the department of gas relief and rehabilitation. They should be implemented in letter and spirit and necessary steps for filling up the vacant posts of doctors and staff by regular channel should be taken up with urgency”, said the committee headed by retired high court judge Justice V K Agrawal.

The monitoring committee further recommended that the posts in the hospital scrapped by the gas relief department should also be restored.

The committee also recommended bio-metric attendance of doctors and stated that staff should ensure action is taken for non-compliance.

The monitoring committee also took note that C-arm table, digital X-ray and ultra-sonography machines were not available and recommended that they should be made available to the hospital opened as far back as 1985 for medical care of gas disaster survivors.

Akesh’s father (left) and relatives. Akesh (inset).

CHENNAI: As the world ushered in the new year with revelry, Kondanchery village in Tiruvallur district , 50km from Chennai, silently saluted the courage of a local hero who died on Christmas night trying to save a woman from her abductors.

T Akesh, who died in a hospital on December 27, two days after being run over by an autorikshaw in which the woman was abducted. The 22-year old was with his five friends at New Colony when they heard the cries of a woman in a passing auto. Even as they took off on their motorbikes, the woman jumped out of the autorikshaw. Akesh and another friend continued to chase the autorickshaw. After a couple of kilometers, when Akesh tried to block the way of the autorickshaw, the vehicle knocked him off a causeway . Akesh had suffered head injuries.

Kodanchery villagers had only good things to talk about Akesh, “the youth with no vices”. He worked as a driver and took care of his parents. The villagers did not allow any vehicle on Kondanchery Road on his funeral day. “This village has never come together like this for anyone. Everything — Christmas, New year, local body elections — took a backseat. Nothing mattered to us for the past few days,” said N Mohan, a neighbour.

Akesh lived in one of the quarters occupied by scheduled castes who lived in a cluster within the village. But people across castes poured into the hospital when Akesh was undergoing treatment and offered financial and emotional support to his parents.

The youngest of three siblings, Akesh dropped out after Class X to support his parents Thiyagaraj and Padmavathi who are farm labourers. He took up a job as a helper in a machinery company and later became a driver there.

His employer, E D Munuswaamy said the relationship they shared was more than professional. “I treated him like my son. His integrity at a young age surprised me. We retained him on our payroll even when we had to shut down our company for a brief period,” Munuswaamy said.

For the first time in several years, Christmas and New Year celebration at the TELC Church in Kondanchery were low-key affairs. In the village, there was no drunk revelry, no clashes.

Containing the fire: File picture of anti CAA protests in Mangaluru recently

Mangaluru: Two weeks after the violence that killed two people and resulted in several others sustaining injuries during anti CAA/NRC protests in Mangaluru, associations and individuals have collected more than Rs 2 crore to help the victims ’ families .

Highly placed sources from the police department told TOI that funds were collected through various channels like bank transfers and others, to give compensation to the victims’ families a few days after the violence.

The collection of funds increased after chief minister B S Yediyurappa withdrew ex-gratia of Rs 10 lakh each from the the victims’ families. In the December 19 violence, Nauseen Kudroli, 49, and Jaleel Bengre, 23, were killed in police firing.

A dozen people were injured in the violence, and some of them are still recuperating in the hospital.

“As per our observation, more than Rs 2 crore has been collected to help victims. The people who have taken the lead in making the donations have decided that out of total amount collected, Rs 25 lakh each will go to Nauseen and Jaleel’s families and the rest will be distributed among the injured . We are not aware when it will be distributed to them,” said a senior police officer, on condition of anonymity.

Another source said the victims families, whose breadwinners were killed, had raised objections when fund raising associations decided to hand over money to injured victims. However, they were convinced about the same after intervention of community leaders. So far, two families, whose members have been killed, were given compensation by former chief ministers H D Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah.

A few days ago, a Trinamool Congress delegation from West Bengal announced compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to the families.

When contacted, B A Mohiuddeen Bava, who is also one among many actively involved in collection of funds, refused to divulge of total amount collected and said: “It is not the right time rto eveal about the total amount of funds collected. Even if we do, there is uncertainty that more funds will not come in. We are trying to help the shooting victims’ families and the injured, who are facing financial difficulties due to the recent violence.”

Coimbatore: The 24-year-old man accused of killing a three-year-old girl at Karattumedu here last May suffered a fracture in the right leg when he attempted to flee from police on Tuesday evening.

The Saravanampatti police had taken Tamil of Kovilpalayam under custody after he surrendered at the office of the village administrative officer (VAO) at Karattumedu on Tuesday morning.

After conducting inquiries, police took him to the Karattumedu Government Elementary School, where the girl was allegedly murdered. “He tried to escape and jumped over the compound wall of the school, only to injure himself,” a police officer said.

Tamil is undergoing treatment in the prison ward of the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH).

The body of Devasree, daughter of P Rubini and Paulraj of Velliankadu near Karamadai, was recovered from near a temple at Karattumedu on May 26 after the mother filed a missing complaint. Postmortem revealed that she was poisoned to death. The Saravanampatti police registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and launched an investigation.

During the inquiry, it was revealed that Rubini had separated from Paulraj and was in a relationship with Tamil, who was working as a location manager for Tamil movies. “Fearing that the child may cause hindrance to their relationship, they decided to kill her. The duo fed the girl biscuits laced with poison and dumped her body near the temple,” the officer added.

After arresting Rubini on May 27, police were on the lookout for Tamil. A special police team had visited Karnataka several times after receiving information that he was hiding there.

Nagpur: For a year riddled with legal battles over temple and mosque to crimes against women, 2019 was a mixed bag that rounded off with a fairly mellowed down Christmas celebration. Asked to rate the same, Krittika Uppal of Centre Point School felt it was a good one for her personally and gave it a grand 9 out of 10, but the class 6 student was disturbed how the country suffered on account of the protests that arose from the CAA and NRC amendments. Samuel Tayde of Kids World School seconded and called the ‘fights’ that happened uncalled for and wished people would have talked to each other before.

For Kevin Tudu of Centre Point School, personally the year fared at a decent 8 and he also praised the government for bringing in the Metro and for the country he rated it a good 9. Kids World’s Sweekriti Shahi was disheartened by how since August, social and communal issues plagued the country, starting from Kashmir to the CAA-NRC protests that even saw many deaths.

Expecting a turn for the better, Shubhangi Kumari of Delhi Public School, Kamptee, wanted people to resolve their fights and live in harmony. As for a personal aspiration, the class 7 student wished she would play less and study more, something she realized is a little difficult to achieve.

Chinmayee Vidhale of Jain International School agreed and took it a notch higher as the youngster opined that to err is human and even though we wish to do right for others and not fight with them, it is difficult since people cannot function as always is expected of a utopian society. Asked the reason for the violence that raged across the country, Krittika said it was because people have lost the patience nowadays to really listen to each other about the issues they debate upon.

The discussion took a more serious turn when the panellists believed that the city and the society at a larger level is not taking enough responsibility to preserve nature and it is resulting in climate changes and causing irreversible damage. Sareena Jiwani of Jain International School wished for people to adhere to rules when it comes to waste management and segregation so that it makes it easier for NMC to take it up from there. Pollution was also a serious cause for concern as Chinmayee believed there should be strict rules for those who violate public spaces for smoking.

Uses of modern gadgets have been a concerning factor for most parents and the panellists too echoed the same. Calvin Wilfred, who was among the few youngsters present to have a personal mobile phone, admitted to being pulled up for using it too often. He, however, believed that it is a necessity today and its restricted use should help.

Anmol Bansal of Centre Point School agreed and said earlier, phones were only used for contacting in case of emergency but now, they have become a distraction with so many applications and curious minds are not shying away from using them for entertainment which divides their concentration. Sarthak Sarwate of Delhi Public School, Kamptee, though wished for strict intelligence against hackers and wanted cyber crimes to be checked.

Personal achievements scored big ground for the panellists as they listed quite a few efforts they undertook that earned them a pat on the back. Shubham Kumar of Delhi Public School won a trophy for a mathematics quiz and Sareena too was praised for scoring good marks in the tests. Shubhangi too won gold for participating in the Mathematics Olympiad. The youngster frequently sits for the exam and has previously won gold and bronze medals.

The discussion then veered towards their school curriculum and faculty teaching styles. Sareena said that she finds mathematics all right, but “the problems are too hard” for her. Shubhangi enjoys participating in class, answering her teachers’ questions and writing them on the blackboard too.

A part of the panel, however, yearned for a more casual and free-flowing relationship with the teachers. “While some teachers are friendly, there are others who just teach their subjects and leave,” said Calvin.

Chinmayee felt that some of the teachers did not stay true to their words in class. “They encourage us to get our doubts clarified during lectures, but when we do ask them something, they are quick to point out that they just explained that concept a while back,” she said.

For many, the issue of “not practising what they preach” extended to their parents as well. “My mother asks me to be covered from head to toe, and always wear thick jackets in winters, but she herself just dons a thin shawl in the chill,” Krittika complained. “They always promise to take us for outings, but do not fulfil them very often,” lamented Anmol.

The panel had extremely diverse career aspirations — ranging from politics to science research — but for most of them, being successful boiled down to working hard and staying grounded.

Then there were the ones whose idea of success was about comforting the afflicted. “With so many people dying of hunger in India every year, I want to open a shelter for the homeless and offer free food to them,” said Sweekriti. Shubhangi, who wants to be a doctor, wanted to devote one day a week for providing free health care to all those who walk into her clinic, especially those who cannot afford to get treated elsewhere.

Being a good human being also meant different things to different panellists, but there was broad consensus on having empathy for those in pain and saying no to discrimination . When asked to choose between being successful and a good human being, the panel unanimously picked the latter. Shubhangi summed up everyone’s sentiments by saying, “What is the point of achieving all that success if one is not a good human being?”

To bring about equality, Sareena said it is important to “share your thoughts and education with others”. For Krittika, it all starts with treating everyone equally, while Sweekriti wanted people to “not be judged for being rich or poor, but for their innate qualities”.

To ensure more peace in India, Samuel wanted people to try and cultivate “warm relationships with everyone”. Small actions could make a big impact, many felt. For instance, if India wins in a sports encounter, Shubhangi said we must not insult the losing team.

“Eventually, we are all going to die, so might as well learn to live peacefully and not keep quarrelling all the time,” Anmol signed off.

The crowd at the MG Road Metro station on Wednesday

KOCHI: The rally carried out by Muslim outfits against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) paralysed the city on Wednesday evening. There was heavy traffic block in the city for almost four to five hours, forcing many of the shops in the city to down shutters by noon in anticipation of the traffic block.

Banerji Road, through which one of the rallies passed to the protest venue at Marine Drive, along Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium-High Court stretch was fully occupied by the protesters. They were seen walking across the footpaths as well. All the vehicles, including private buses, kept off the road leaving commuters in the lurch. Metro came to the rescue of commuters. The Metro ridership reached more than one lakh at 8pm. All the Metro stations were crowded. In the routes where there are no Metro services, passengers had a tough time.

A KSRTC bus was stuck amidst the crowd for almost an hour, while many had to wait for hours on end to get out of a theatre complex in the city as Banerji Road was fully occupied by the protesters. “We have to go to Vypeen side. So, we have to take a U-turn. But we are unable to move an inch even forward, let along the U-turn. We have been trapped here for more than an hour,” said a passenger on the KSRTC bus.

With motorists taking other roads like MG Road following the blockade on Banerji Road, traffic bottlenecks extended to all across the city centre. Even ambulances got trapped in traffic snarls. With police focusing on the venue at Marine Drive and Shanmugham Road , there was nobody to regulate the traffic on MG Road and Chittoor Road .

HYDERABAD: Liquor literally flowed in Hyderabad as tipplers spent a whopping Rs 210 crore on various brands as they bade goodbye to 2019 on Tuesday night and ushered in New Year . The total value of liquor sales in Telangana on December 31 night was around Rs 350 crore, market experts said.Across the state, 1,91,323 cases of beer and 2,11,515 cases of Indian-made foreign liquor were sold on Tuesday night alone. “With Hyderabad alone catering to 60% of the sales, Rs 210 crore worth beer and other liquor brands were lapped up by the guzzlers in the city,” a trader explained.Curiously, the total sales value remained the same when compared to the last year despite the increase in the prices recently. On December 31, 2018, 2,18,007 cases of beer and 2,00,051 cases of IMFL were sold across the state. “There was a slight dip in the number of cases sold when compared to the last year. But, increase in the prices made up for the total sale value remaining intact,” sources in the liquor trade averred.Meanwhile, some liquor shops, in their bid to woo tipplers, came up with innovative ideas to increase sales on December 31 night. For instance, in Mahabubabad, a shop owner announced a lucky draw scheme. Those who made a purchase of above Rs 2,000 was given an opportunity to participate in the lucky draw. The first prize winner would get an LCD TV, second prize winner a smart phone and third prize winner would get silver coins.Many liquor lovers fell for the bait and stood in a long queue to buy liquor.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063390,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-128081,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-year-revelry-hyd-drowns-in-rs-210cr-liquor/articleshow/73062516.cms

120,['2/01/2020'],Falling prices of drumstick fail to attract customers,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Coimbatore: When Gowri S, a resident of R S Puram, sends her daughter to buy vegetables for the week, she has only two instructions for her: “Don’t bother buying drumstick. We can buy and eat it next month. And don’t buy more than 2kg of small onions.”

Though drumstick prices have fallen from Rs 400 per kg to Rs 200 per kg, households still find it too expensive.

“Drumstick is mainly used to make a side dish or poriyal served at lunch, it is also used to make a specific ‘kolambu’ or gravy and in sambhar,” said Geetha T, a resident of Meena Estate. “We can do without it. We rather spend that excess money on onions, which is essential,” she added.

Onion and shallot prices, which had shot up to Rs 140 to Rs 180 per kg, have fallen to around Rs 90 per kg, giving households a measure of relief. “Onions are more important because it is there in nearly every dish we prepare,” Geetha said. “You can reduce it but not replace it,” she added.

Onion prices have begun decreasing when imported stocks from Egypt and Turkey began entering the market. Though the public gave them a cold shoulder, some arrivals from Maharashtra have begun helping prices come down. “The onions were a dark pink and a few were too large, so people did not seem to prefer the imported onions and some hoteliers claimed that their gravy colours were changing when those onions were used,” said C Dorairaj of Kovai Pazhamudhir Nilayam. “However, prices of our usual onions have dropped after arrivals have begun from Maharashtra,” he added.

Drumstick, which is usually bought from the Oddanchatram vegetable market had seen its prices increase to Rs 350 per kg in the wholesale market and Rs 400 per kg in the retail market. “The rapid price increase was due to lack of arrivals from north India, which is reeling under a cold wave and a cyclone earlier,” Jothi, a wholesale vegetable trader, said. “Earlier we used to get at least four tonnes of drumstick a day from north Indian states. But now we hardly get one to two tonnes a day. There were even days when we hardly got 50 large sacks a day,” he said.

However, the market has begun receiving drumstick from Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. “ We have begun receiving drumsticks from Gujarat and Andhra, so prices will further fall to around Rs 100 per kg in a fortnight, but for it to return to Rs 40 per kg, it will happen only in February,” the trasder said.

Hyderabad: Scores of students from Osmania University, University of Hyderabad, Maulana Azad National Urdu University (Manuu), English and Foreign Languages University (Eflu), Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) among others pledged to defend the Constitution at Arts College on Osmania University campus as part of their protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on Wednesday.

Students who participated in the programme organised under the aegis of Young India National Coordination Committee -- Hyderabad Chapter in the city also resolved to not show any documents to prove their citizenship.

“Today, we took a pledge to defend our Constitution and to not show any documents to prove our citizenship. We will also campaign and convince others in the city to not give any information sought in the name of proving our citizenship,” said Faizan Sarwar, national joint secretary of All India Students Association.

Armed with placards that read ‘Reject CAA, Boycott NRC’, ‘We reject NRC’ and ‘KCR Stop NPR’, students read out the Preamble and the draft resolution created against CAA, NRC and NPR along with students across the country, who also organised mass pledges at various universities.

“We, today on January 1 2020, reiterate our resolve to give ourselves a society that will be free of oppressors and take an oath to not show any document to prove our citizenship and we will observe and propagate complete non-cooperation with anti-constitution and anti-India forces,” read the draft resolution framed by the students.

“We, the people of India, are sovereign as we give ourselves the Constitution. No government elected by us on the basis of this Constitution has the right to turn around and ask the people to prove our citizenship on the basis of a divisive diabolical agenda trampling upon the very core of our Constitution.”

They said that they will be participating in ‘million march’ on January 4 and trade union protest on January 8.

“To make the trade union protests successful, all varsities in the state will remain closed on January 8,” said Janardhan G, state general secretary, Democratic Students’ Union (DSU).

Protesting students were joined by members of 20 organisations and people from different walks of life.

KOLKATA: It’s not just the streets of the city that are reverberating with protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The protests are now echoing in the creative corridors too. The city saw a high-profile English theatre festival over the last weekend, where the artists talked about “disgust and exasperation at the slicing or artificial divide” that the amended Act has been alleged of bringing in.It saw some of the city’s best-known names in the circuit speak out against the Centre’s initiative. They said that since the early 19th century the country’s intellectuals have been speaking out against communalism and rabid fundamentalism and the trend continues even today.The three-day fest started on Friday and celebrated the golden jubilee of ‘The Red Curtain’, the oldest surviving amateur theatre group in the city. It was formed in 1969 by undergraduates of Loreto and St Xavier’s colleges. At the fest, a narrative written and read out by theatre scholar and critic Ananda Lal focused on the history of English theatre in the city since 1831 when the first English play, ‘The Persecuted’, was written by a 19-year-old Krishnamohan Banerjee. The play was a reaction to conservative Hindus who had forbidden him and his friends from the Young Bengal Movement from consuming beef roast and had thrown him out of the house.Failing to stage the play despite his best efforts, he converted to Christianity and became a priest. A few years later, Michael Madhusudan Dutt wrote ‘Rizia’ and tried to persuade Keshub Chandra Ganguly, a leading actor in Belgachia Theatre, to get the Rajas of Paikpara and Jyotindramohan Tagore for sponsorship/approval. The play, however, was never staged.“What you see around you is nothing new. Intellectuals have always fought such divisive urges,” Lal said. A book tracing such history — ‘Indian Drama in English : The Beginnings’ — was launched during the course of the festival.The festival saw a solo act by Jayant Kripalani, ‘An Evening with Mr Tagore’. It was based on Tagore’s prose, poetry and philosophy on inclusiveness and plurality against sectarian divisive politics. Incidentally, Kripalani has been walking in almost every anti-CAA/NRC protest rallies in the city. “I hope to do everything in my power to rubbish the new act. I think it negates everything that India stands for,” Kripalani said.Rustom Bharucha, faculty of theatre at JNU, spoke about the necessity of plurality in India. There were pop-up acts from seminal plays — such as Girish Karnad’s Tal-e-Danda, Mahesh Dattani’s The Final Solution and Manjula Padmanabhan’s Hidden Fires — that spoke against communal violence and tyranny by the state. Actors like Dhritiman Chatterjee, Vinay Sharma, Anubha Fatepuria, Nibedita Bhattacharjee, Mira Kakkar and Nupur Ghosh were seen in these plays.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064283,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-554136,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/theatre-groups-slam-politics-of-division-preach-harmony-unity/articleshow/73062498.cms

Representative image

HYDERABAD: The New Year didn’t bring much cheer for homemakers as LPG cylinder price in Hyderabad saw a jump of Rs 21. The rates for a cylinder on the first day of the year were the highest among all the metro cities in the country. A 14.2kg LPG cylinder cost consumers Rs 769 on Wednesday. On December 31, its price was Rs 748.

The commercial cylinder, weighing 19 kg, also served a New Year shocker as its price had gone up to Rs 1,400 from Rs 1,368 — a jump of Rs 32 — in a matter of 24 hours. This cylinder is mostly used in the hotel industry and hostels.

Consumers were upset with the price hike . “As if the high price of onions, tomatoes and potatoes wasn’t enough, we are now forced to shell out more on a cylinder. There is no respite for middle class people,” complained SL Pragati, a housewife from Ameerpet.

Expressing dismay at the increase of Rs 21 on each cylinder, some consumers said running a family with the prices of essential commodities at an all-time high was not a joke. “It is as if we are hit from all sides and the government seems to do nothing about it,” rued M Vanajakshi, a techie from Madhapur .

Market experts said the price of the commercial cylinder in Hyderabad when compared to other metros was also steep. “The rates in the districts will be higher than Hyderabad as the state-run fuel retailers will add the transportation costs also,” an expert explained. The fuel retailers change LPG cylinder price every month based on the international rate.

Hyderabad has an added advantage as the Charlapalli plant is located close to the city. But, consumers in districts like Jangaon, Adilabad and Nizamabad are not so lucky as they will have to bear the transportation costs. “The difference will be more than Rs 7-10 from what is charged in Hyderabad,” said Sai Reddy, a gas dealer.

Gas dealers said though rates had gone up, there was no shortage of gas supply in the city and districts. “Refill cylinders are being delivered within two days once a booking is done,” a gas dealer said.

The dealers acknowledged that Wednesday’s was the highest hike when compared to recent hikes. “The price of a cylinder had touched Rs 1,000 in April-May 2019. In that sense, the latest jump is not beyond the reach of consumers,” a dealer remarked.

Presently, the government ensures delivery of 12 cylinders to each household in a year and the subsidy provided by the government on the quota of 12 cylinders varies from one month to another. “Factors like changes in the average international LPG price and foreign exchange rates determine the subsidy component,” a gas dealer said.

AGRA: As a goodwill gesture on new year, the district jail administration on Wednesday released nine prisoners , who were serving extra time as they were not able to pay the penalty imposed on them.

A local businessman and social worker Pravendra Yadav paid the total penalty amount of over Rs 61,000 for their release.

Jail superintendent Shashikant Mishra said, “Most of the prisoners released on Wednesday had committed crimes under the Railways Act (theft of property belonging to the railways) and are first-time offenders. They have promised not to repeat their crimes.” “Despite having completed their jail terms, they were not released as they were not able to pay the penalty imposed on them. With inspiration from senior officials, we regularly approach social workers and philanthropists to help them pay this and avoid extra term,” he added.

According to the prison records, the nine prisoners released on Wednesday are in the age group of 18 to 40 years.

In the past two years as superintendent of the Agra district jail, Mishra has managed to arrange for payment of penalties of over 300 prisoners serving extended jail terms. Last year, he was awarded a commemoration medal by the inspector general (prisons).

Panaji: Villagers in five talukas of Goa – Pernem, Quepem, Canacona, Bardez and Bicholim – have been selected under the start-up village entrepreneurship program (SVEP) in Goa, to take up skill-building activities.

“Most of these villagers are farmers who engage in cultivation of crops only during the peak agriculture months. During the other months, they engage in small plantation activities. These activities will be converted into sustainable enterprise, for which we provide them with handholding support,” said Raaj Naik, project manager at the Agnel Institute.

The SVEP scheme which aims to support entrepreneurs in rural areas to set up local enterprises is a sub component of the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission of the Union ministry of rural development.

“The scheme is aimed at the creation of rural entrepreneurs by developing a sustainable model for village entrepreneurship promotion through tools for training and capacity-building in Goa over a span of four years,” Naik said.

“We are preparing a detailed project report to start this scheme. After it is submitted, we will start the activity in these villages. We are likely to launch the scheme in April,” Naik added.

The state district rural development agency is helping the institute identify rural belts and reach out to locals for the programme.

Bhopal/Jabalpur: Madhya Pradesh high court on Monday issued notice to former BJP minister Narottam Mishra while calling for records from the special court set up in Bhopal for trial of state politicians in response to a criminal revision petition filed by former Congress MLA Rajendra Bharti.

Bharti had alleged in a complaint before court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Datia that while contesting the 2008 assembly polls, Mishra had concealed information regarding ownership of a vehicle and urged the court to order for registering a criminal case and also a case under Representation of Peoples’ Act.

The case was transferred to special court in Bhopal which dismissed Bharti’s complaint earlier this year. Subsequently, Bharti moved an appeal before the high court.

The petitioner alleged in his petition that on November 4, 2008, when Narottam Mishra filed the affidavit for contesting assembly polls, he owned a vehicle with registration number HRB-37-B-1282, but this information was not provided in the affidavit.

Later, the same vehicle was seized at Jigna police station for violation of Motor Vehicles’ Act on November 27, 2008. On November 28, 2008, Mishra through his counsel had made representation before court for handing over the vehicle to him as he is the registered owner of the said vehicle, alleged the petitioner.

Later, on December 1, 2008 the vehicle was handed over to Mishra by court on surety of Rs 3 lakh, considering him to the registered owner of the vehicle, the petitioner alleged.

But Mishra had said that the vehicle was not in his name, Bharti alleged in the petition.

HYDERABAD: The Telangana High Court has directed the state government to involve private hospitals and diagnostic labs in the state in its fight against swine flu that is likely to spread its tentacles during the winter season.

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy said this while hearing two public interest petitions filed by Dr M Karuna and advocate Rapolu Bhaskar, questioning the negligence of the officials of medical and health department, and also the civic authorities in taking steps to control the spread of swine flu, dengue and other diseases.

The bench went through the affidavits filed by the state’s chief secretary SK Joshi and director of public health Dr G Srinivas Rao, both of whom were silent on the aspect of involving private hospitals in both diagnosis and treatment of these viral fevers. The bench sought information from them as to what they have done in this regard by Jan 3.

Advocate general BS Prasad has informed the court that since vaccination meant for swine flu is fraught with certain side effects, people are preferring to consume medicines in the form of tablets and syrups. “Hence, we have kept sufficient stocks of the same at all primary health centres all over the state, and our doctors are ready to deal with any likely spread of swine flu,” the AG said.

“We need permission from National Centre for Disease Control to set up diagnostic labs,” public health director, G Srinivas Rao, said in his affidavit. “We thought of setting up 10 labs in various towns and cities of the state, but as the permission is yet to arrive, we could not set them up so far,” he said.

The bench directed the state to sensitise the district medical and health officers (DMHOs) all over the state and also the existing diagnostic labs about the looming danger of swine flu spreading during the coming winter months.

KOCHI: The filling of explosives to facilitate the demolition of four illegal apartment complexes at Maradu will begin on Friday. Explosives will be filled up in holes made at Holy Faith H2O from 6am on Friday. The explosives will be transported to the site in an explosive van from the storage facility at Angamaly at 5am.

Explosives will be filled in other buildings that are to be demolished after that. It will take minimum one week to fill up the holes with explosives in each building. More police personnel will be deployed in the area once the filling of explosives starts to check people from encroaching into the building compound.

Meanwhile, the two demolition agencies — Edifice Engineering and Vijay Steels and Explosives — have prepared disaster management plan for each building and submitted it to sub-collector Snehil Kumar Singh. District collector will have to approve the plan.

The plan will be discussed at a meeting on Friday that will be attended by the city police commissioner and others senior officials. Deployment of police personnel on around 200m radius of each building, map of the area and traffic diversion plans will be discussed at the meeting.

Around 600 people, who reside in nearby buildings, will have to be evacuated during the demolition of the four buildings on January 11 and 12. The residents will be lodged in Sacred Heart college at Thevara and Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies at Panangad.

The residents will be evacuated two hours prior to the demolition. A control room will be set up to monitor the demolition proceedings on the day. Alfa Serene and Holy Faith H2O will be demolished on January 11, and the control room will function from Maradu municipality office that day. On January 12, when Jains Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram will be razed, the control room will be set up outside 200m radius of the buildings.

Meanwhile, Maradu municipality remitted premium of around Rs 89 lakh to National Insurance company towards the insurance amount of Rs 95 crore. A municipality official said the demolition agencies will repair the cracks developed in nearby structures, before the actual demolition takes place. “If any damage is reported during or after the demolition, it will be covered in the insurance. Municipality paid the amount five days ago,” said the official.

Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (Peso) on Wednesday night gave permit to Vijay Steels and Explosives to undertake explosive works at Alfa Serene, under 25 conditions. Explosives for the demolition of Alfa serene will reach Perumbavoor on Sunday or Monday and the filling up of holes will start by Tuesday.

Action council of residents near Alfa Serene started an indefinite hunger strike on Wednesday seeking protection to their lives and properties. The action council took out a proclamation march, which was inaugurated by retired sub-judge M R Sasi. Local self-government minister A C Moideen has convened a meeting of officials and action council members on Thursday.

HYDERABAD: From a paltry Rs 50 lakh worth of assets attached in 2018-19, Enforcement Directorate ( ED ), Hyderabad, came a long way in financial year 2019-20, with attachments totalling Rs 1,065 crore involving properties of companies and individuals for money laundering as well as other frauds.

On New Year’s eve, ED attached Rs 51.45 crore in IDBI Bank fraud case in Visakhapatnam relating to issuance of loans for pisciculture farmers. Prime accused Kumar Pappu Singh had acted as an aggregator and obtained loans in the names of 87 marginal farmers. He took Rs 70 crore loans fraudulently from IDBI Bank, an official said. ED found that Singh had utilised the money for personal investments.

In scams involving entities such as Musaddilal, Heera Group, Future Maker Life Care (FMLC), eBIZ.com and Q City, the enforcement agency attached close to Rs 200 crore worth properties. Sources said cases of attachment of properties under Prevention of Money Laundering Act saw a spurt after the change of guard at ED, Hyderabad.

In the Musaddilal scam, seizures pertain to a money laundering case in which group MD Kailash Chand Gupta and his two sons — Nitin Gupta and Nikhil Gupta — along with other accused allegedly created forged documents and fraudulently exchanged over Rs 110 crore demonetised cash soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation in November 2016.

The accused showed purchases by 5,200 customers within a span of about four hours from 8.30 pm to 12 midnight (soon after the demonetisation was announced). ED confiscated Rs 85 crore worth of properties of the accused.

In the Heera Group scam, accused Nowhera Shaik is alleged to have duped thousands of investors promising high returns from deposits in gold scheme. ED attached Rs 300 crore worth of their properties.

In two cases of multi-level marketing , ED confiscated huge properties. In FMLC pyramid scam Rs 261 crore was attached and in eBIZ.com case Rs 278 crore assets were seized. In FEMA violation case, Rs 86 crore assets of Q City Tech Park were attached in Hyderabad.

In individual bank loan fraud cases, ED attached properties of Ganne Srinivas worth Rs 2.42 crore and in a disproportionate assets case involving a tahsildar Rs 1.08 crore worth properties were attached.

Representative image

CHENNAI: The Madras high court has stayed the process begun by Anna University to hire guest lecturers and visiting fellows for its affiliate colleges across the state on a temporary and hourly basis.

Vacation judge Justice V Parthiban passed the interim order on the plea moved by G Arutperumjyothi – a temporary teaching fellow of the university challenging the recruitment.

According to the petitioner, the registrar of the university issued an advertisement dated December 19, 2019 calling for applications to the posts of guest lecturers and visiting fellows on hourly basis.

“While there are already 518 such temporary faculties employed by the university for its affiliate colleges for several years, the university has called for applications for fresh appointments without regularising the existing temporary staff,” the petitioner said. He said the university engaged faculties on temporary basis with impunity and without any approval in total violation of established principles of law enunciated by the Supreme Court and the high courts.

“Time and again courts have come down heavily upon engagement of faculties on temporary basis without identifying the actual workforce required for teaching. Besides this, there is no category of appointment as teaching fellows in the UGC Regulations, 2010,” he said.

Relying on the AICTE regulations, the petitioner said the rules were very clear that there shall be only three designations in respect of teachers — assistant professors, associate professors and professors. There is no other nomenclature for appointment as teaching fellows/ visiting fellows/guest lecturers.

The petitioner said that only 10% of the teaching staff are employed on regular basis by the university for its constituent colleges. All other teaching faculties are engaged only on temporary basis.

SECUNDERABAD: The second largest cantonment of the country, Secunderabad , was ranked as the worst performer among all 62 cantonment boards surveyed in the Centre’s Swachh Survekshan League 2020 (SS League 2020) rankings.The ministry of housing and urban affairs released results of the last two quarters beginning April in New Delhi.The SS League 2020, which monitors cleanliness in cities/cantonment boards, allotted 2,000 marks for each quarter. According to the results, the Secunderabad Cantonment Board ( SCB ) secured 136.83 marks in the first quarter and 10.61 marks in the second quarter, thereby ending in the last spot in both quarters.With 1187.39 marks, the St. Thomas Mount cantonment in Tamil Nadu secured the first spot in the first quarter and Delhi cantonment stood at the top by securing 1368.55 marks in the second quarter. The evaluation was done based on services provided, observation and citizen feedback through outbound phone calls.With a 42-square kilometre area and population of nearly four lakh residents, the SCB is the second largest cantonment in the country. However, it failed to compete with other cantonments which are significantly smaller with predominant army presence.Dehu road in Pune, Nainital, Wellington, Shimla are among those who have emerged among the top 20 cantonments in the country in the SS League 2020.Residents claim that the SCB’s ranking has been affected due to its failure in collecting garbage, not providing adequate public toilets and poor solid waste management.“Even today, many colonies in SCB wards don’t have public bins, forcing people to throw garbage on roads. This garbage is often not picked up by the SCB cleaners. Apart from this, there are insufficient public toilets,” said Sudha Konidela, a resident of Vasavi Nagar Colony.Residents blamed SCB for not making enough efforts in taking up developmental works in the areas under its limits. “For years, the SCB has been crying over shortage of funds. Basic issues related to road repair, water and cleanliness have not been addressed due to shortage of funds. The rankings look poorly on the cantonment,” said Jeetendra Surana, secretary of All Cantonments Citizens Welfare Association.Admitting its inability to perform well in the rankings, the SCB authorities passed the buck to the Centre over its failure in clearing dues. “Since we are yet to receive Rs 550 crore from the Centre, we are unable to meet even basic needs of the residents. We are unable to pay our contractors, sweepers. Therefore, we are falling back in terms of cleanliness,” said J Ramakrishna, SCB vice-president.Ramakrishna said paucity of funds forced the board to seek help. “So far, we were self-sustaining. However, for the first time in the history, we were forced to go for aided board as the gap between residents’ needs and availability of funds is only increasing by the day. The Centre should distribute funds proportionately to enable us to perform our basic civic activities,” said Ramakrishna.The performance of cities in SS League 2020 is crucial to their ranking in Swachh Survekshan 2020 due to the 25% weightage of the quarterly assessment to be included in the annual survey scheduled to commence from January 4 till January 31, 2020.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063367,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-262894,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/clean-up-time-scb-hits-bottom-in-swachh-league-2020-ranking/articleshow/73062549.cms

PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that has a diameter of less than 2.5 microns, which is even lesser than pollen.The data was collated from the six Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations in the city.The reading on December 6 fell under the ‘poor’ category, which is between 201 ug/m3 and 300 ug/m3. As per CPCB standards, people with prolonged exposure in the area develop breathing difficulties. On November 6, the station in Sanathnagar recorded its second highest figure of the year of PM2.5 (274 ug/m3).The last two months of the year were the worst for residents, data shows. While there were 12 ‘poor’ days in November, nine were recorded in December. The readings are higher than any other part if the city.Other stations did not record any data falling under the ‘poor’ category through the year. The station at Zoo park recorded a high of 173 ug/m3 on December 18.Unregulated industrial units as well as the high density of population in Sanathnagar are to blame for the pollution levels, say activists and residents.“There are so many small industries and workers, including those involved in activities like welding, who are located in and around Sanathnagar area,” said Rani Pasumarti, a local. The teacher said it is worrying that pollution levels are this high and this would have long-term effect on the health of children.Suresh Reddy , also a local, said, “The proximity to the Mumbai highway may be also be behind the high pollution levels.” He said that even opening one’s windows during peak traffic hours has become difficult because of the amount of vehicular emissions.Speaking to TOI, scientist Babu Rao, said the PM2.5 data was very high in the area. “Authorities must clearly mention what measures are being taken to combat this,” he said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73065878,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-586140,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sanathnagar-was-most-polluted-area-of-hyderabad-last-year/articleshow/73062570.cms

Back home too, it marked a historic moment with two people of Telugu-origin, making it to the cabinet — Prasad Panda , minister of infrastructure and Leela Sharon Aheer, minister of culture, multiculturalism and status of women.Reportedly, both were first elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Canadian province, Alberta, in 2015. While Panda was born in Guntur’s Sangam Jagarlamudi village, Aheer has her roots in Visakhapatnam.On her recent trip to the city, TOI caught up with the 49-year-old musician-turned-minister, where Aheer spoke about her political journey, which began 14 years ago, and what she aspires to achieve for women in her constituency.“Back then, I used to volunteer for political events but never looked at it as a career option. I was running my private business,” she said, admitting that her friends nudged her to take the plunge, given her interest in it. Following an aggressive campaign, she was elected to the Alberta Assembly in 2015.Now, on her debut run as minister, Aheer has her agenda well chalked out: women’s empowerment, both at home and in society.“One thing that always disturbs me is the way women and children continue to be abused in all societies all over the world. It is time for real talk about the violation of human rights and speak out candidly about honour killings, human trafficking , child marriage and female genital mutilation. We need to engage all ages and genders to have conversations on how we can protect our rights,” said Aheer who declared November 19, 2019 as ‘Women’s Entrepreneurship Day’ in Alberta, at the first-ever Canada-based Women’s Entrepreneurship summit. The day aims to encourage women entrepreneurs and create opportunities for the world to recognise the many ways women contribute to the economy.Persuading women to join politics is also on her to-do list. Incidentally, for the first time, 44% of the contestants in the 2019 elections were women. “Although 51% population of Canada comprises women, until last elections, only a handful of them joined politics. Women felt they are incapable and lacked self-confidence. Last year our aim was to encourage more women to contest,” said Aheer while assuring another thing: unity, collaboration and inclusion within her province.“Be it people who cannot speak English or people who are new to the country, we want them to feel at home and not alienated. I urge the youth who are our future to engage in policy because it is the need of the hour. Wonders can happen if the people and government collaborate and work for a better world to live in,” the minister said appealing to people to break down barriers of religion, caste, economic status and gender.As the conversation veered towards India, Aheer professed her love for the country and sarees, which she said, she loves to wear whenever she gets the opportunity. “India is my second home and I feel my heart beat in India. I feel so close to my family and the people of this country, especially the South. I feel at home because I am home,” Aheer said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064831,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-28791,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/i-feel-at-home-says-telugu-origin-canada-minister-on-vizag-visit/articleshow/73062567.cms

With the Centre planning to revive 100 lakes in the country including the Kapra, TOI asked readers what should be the salient features of the revival process

As Centre seeks proposals, what should be the key focus of the lake revival project?

would like to congratulate the government on taking important steps to revive the lakes in the country. As a chief environmental engineer (retd) I have dealt with lake remediation to some extent. The primary reason for pollution of the Kapra lake in the inflow of sewage from surrounding colonies into the catchment of the lake. I have also witnessed seen construction material getting dumped near the periphery of the lake. First step in the revival process of the lake should be diversion of drainage and nala water into the lake. Installing STPs in drains do not work because maintenance and over loading of STP makes such the system defunct within a few years. This was what happened during the Hussainsagar lake remediation. The next issue that needs to be addressed is the removal of water hyacinth. It is unlikely that mechanical methods such as dredging will help. Experts must be involved to tackle the issue. If these issues are tackled , Kapra lake can be revived in a sustainable manner and the scientific Laboratory parameters of lake can be brought back to normal.

Arun Kumar

Most of the lakes in the city have been completely destroyed,and the ones that have survived have been encroached upon. Large water bodies have been converted into small pools and ponds. Some of the lakes which are completely destroyed include the Djal Konta, Somajiguda Tank, Mir Jumla Tank, Mount Tagal Konta, Konta Bhawani Das, Nawab Sahib Konta, Afzal Sagar, Naalacanta, Masab Tank etc. Of the thousands of water reservoirs in Hyderabad that existed in the 1970s, very few of them survive today. Most of them have disappeared because of encroachments or have been encroached by private parties. The existing lakes have been used to throw garbage and as an outlet for drainage water. The area of Hussainsagar, the largest lake in Hyderabad, has shrunk by more than 40% in 30 years, from 550 hectares to 349 hectares. The lake was built in 1575 and has not been used as a source for drinking water since 1930. Similarly, the area occupied by the Shamirpet lake has shrunk from 486 hectares in 1989 to 256 hectares in 2006.According to current government rules, no construction is permitted, regardless of ownership of the lake bed. The authorities must look into this matter and ensure that the water bodies of the city are not encroached upon by government agencies or private parties. Lakes are integral parts of the environment, and need to be protected.

Syed Shamsuddin Maghrabi

In 2016, I attended an informal meeting of residents in and around the Kapra area, presided over by officials from the Department of Irrigation. In response to our concerns over depleting depths of the water bodies, we were told that the phenomena was caused due to heavy silting from the water body being. Now this status has to be reviewed by the government, from the standpoint that the land around the water bodies may no longer be agricultural as they have become residential in nature. GHMC should work towards converting the depleting water bodies into healthy lake. The lake's water and land area must be cordoned off to keep out intruders, grabbers and the like. Landscapers, recreational and water sport promoters be encouraged to submit proposals to run the place as public facilities on a commercial basis. The Hussainsagar lake and its peripherals may provide an excellent model to follow. No revival is complete until a safety and security system is put in place. The Kapra lake revival project can be customised to fit in a top-notch security system. Experts must be involved to ensure that all aspects of the revival project is taken care of.

Ravi Sishta

The biggest issue in and around lakes in the city and country is encroachment. All lakes should be fenced and monitored periodically so that encroachment is contained at the very first place. The lakes should be protected to indirectly protect the flora and fauna of the geographic area. Lakes should be well treated and cleared of the hyacinth that multiply rapidly. They should be removed on a regular basis to protect water bodies as well as organisms in the lakes. The lakes should have a walkway all around so that the people can visit the lake and this can be used to promote tourism. Lakes are an integral area of the city that need to be protected, especially in these times of environment degradation

Deepesh Surana

Key focus of the lake revival project must include quick identification of encroached lakes and those water bodies that are vulnerable to encroachments. Stringent action must be taken against corrupt authorities who allowed lakes to be encroached on and gave permits to construct structures in the vicinity of the water bodies. Evacuation of the illegal constructions must be done by giving fair compensation to flat purchasers, but strict action must be taken against builders who constructed these flats. Sewage must not be allowed to flow into water bodies. The flora and fauna in the water bodies must be protected. Industries must not be allowed to toss their water for by products into lakes. Afforestation must be encouraged.

N Srinivasa Rao

Due to laxity of officials and apathy of state governments, many scenic lakes which once served as a recreation were turned either a dumping yard or polluted badly due to let out of untreated dirty water or poisonous chemicals and other substances. In order to save such lakes from total extinction and revive such lakes, the state should come out with a plan of action like getting the entire lake cleaned by removing all weed etc and the fence on all sides to prevent encroachment. Secondly, the entire perimeter of the water body must be planted with different varieties of plants to give aesthetic look to the place. Besides, a garden with cafeteria and provision for games at the entrance to the lake would go a long way in attracting tourists from far and wide to visit the place as part of the tour itinerary. Above all, a notice board detailing the importance of the lake should be installed. Periodical monitoring by authorities is imperative for the lake to be a part of tourist destination.

Srinivasan Ramaswamy

It is an excellent decision by the Central government to revive 100 wetlands across the country. It is good to know that Kapra lake in Hyderabad and Pakhal lake in Warangal have been added to the much-needed list. This was an important move that has been taken up by the Ministry of Environment. Most of the lakes in Hyderabad are highly polluted. The extremely high biochemical oxygen demand of theses water bodies should be controlled and it should be brought down to less than 6 milligram per litre. Chemicals such as mercury, lead, zinc etc have seeped into these water bodies and destroying the entire ecosystem. Therefore, I request the state government to restore all water bodies and clean them on top priority.

Nandikanti Sai Kumar.

Congress leader Iqbal Khan received a gunshot wound

Bhopal: Panic gripped Govindpura locality on Tuesday night after former home minister late Satyadev Katare’s son — Yogesh Katare — fired a shot with a country-made pistol on a Congress leader over a petty dispute.

The victim sustained severe injury on his finger. Govindpura police reached the spot after getting information and rushed the injured to hospital. A case on charges of attempt to murder has been registered against Yogesh and his accomplices at Govindpura police station and further investigations are underway.

ASP Sanjay Sahu said that victim Iqbal Khan, (52), a resident of Bagh Farhat Afza in Aishbagh, works in a courier company. He is also the district general secretary in Congress party.

Khan told police that he was going to his friend’s house in Kailash Nagar near Shanti Niketan Colony on his bike around 11.30pm to congratulate him on the birth of his granddaughter. While on the way at Shanti Niketan Colony, he spotted that former minister Satyadev Katare’s son and former MLA Hemant Katare’s brother Yogesh along with his friends standing around a bonfire. Khan also stopped for a while and stood around the fire.

ASP Sahu said that Iqbal alleged that Yogesh and his friends were under the influence of alcohol and they manhandled him over a petty argument. Police investigations revealed that Iqbal too was in an inebriated state.

Iqbal said that he left and went to his friend’s house in Kailash Nagar. A few minutes later, Yogesh and his friends also reached the spot.

As Iqbal came out of his friend’s house, Yogesh pointed a pistol on him. The victim grabbed the pistol by his right hand and a shot got fired.

Iqbal’s friend and his neighbours came out hearing the gunshot noise but by that time Yogesh and his accomplices fled the spot. Later, cops reached the spot and rushed him to a nearby hospital from where he was discharged after primary treatment.

ASP Sahu said that cops have registered a case on charges of attempt to murder against Yogesh and his accomplices. Investigations are underway and cops are searching for the accused.

Iqbal said that if he had not grabbed the pistol from Yogesh, he might have killed him on the spot.

According to civic body officials, a path work has been laid for minor potholes in all the city’s wards.

AGRA: The Agra Municipal Corporation ( AMC ) administration, due to lackadaisical approach of the officials, has failed to meet its December 31 deadline and make the city roads “pothole free”. Worse, even after a month’s delay, repairing work has not been initiated on over a dozen main road stretches. Since November, the deadline had been extended twice.

According to civic body officials, a path work has been laid for minor potholes in all the city’s wards. Some roads are in poor condition and need urgent attention. Work, in this regard, will be initiated in the next few days.

Unhappy residents are also raising questions on the “poor quality” of road repair, which has been a huge inconvenience for the people. Shahganj resident Madan Agarwal said, “The quality of road repairing work is very poor. In my ward, concrete from repaired potholes started coming out within a few days of it being filled up. State government must conduct a technical probe on quality of the work done and the money spent.”

UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had reportedly ordered all the civic bodies to complete the road repairing work by November end. Unable to complete their work, AMC engineers extended the deadline to December 15 and then to December 31. However, the work is yet to be completed.

Around half of the city roads being maintained by AMC are not in good condition. Roads at Madia Katra, Boghipura, Kailashpuri, Shahganj locality, Paschimpuri, Sikandra Road, Maruti Estate, interior roads of Pratapura locality, Lohamandi Belanganj, Peepal Mandi, Daresi, Heerabagh, Devri Road and Nunihai, are among those in dire need of repair. Roads in Trans-Yamuna locality, Kamla Nagar, Jaipur house, Tajganj also require immediate repair.

Diwakar Sharma, a resident of Kheria crossing, said, “Interior roads of residential areas are in a very poor state. No patch work has taken place in these localities. The pothole-free campaign has become a scope of corruption for civic body officials.”

On Wednesday, AMC chief engineer AK Singh assured, “A majority of small potholes have been filled up across the city. Tender process for repairing major potholes has been completed. The remaining road repairing work will be completed within this month.”

140,['2/01/2020'],CAA Protest in Kolkata: Bengal finds new protest tool in Kolam,"An anti-NRC Kolam at Trichy, Tamil Nadu

KOLKATA: Kolam protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, are traversing across state borders and will be used in Bengal as well. Social, political and cultural organizations, which have been taking to the streets since the new law was passed, will use Kolam to register their protests.“We felt the need to draw Kolams after a few protesters were arrested in Chennai for painting and writing anti-CAA/NRC slogans on the roads. We shall show solidarity to the movement that will bind the south and the north across communities,” said Tanmoy Ghosh, secretary of Bangla Sanskriti Mancha. The organization, which promotes Bengal’s culture, has planned to draw Kolams on the road during a protest rally from Gariahat to Garia this week.Kolam, which resembles Alpana or Rangoli, is a design made with rice flour, chalk or rock powder. Primarily used during festive seasons, Kolam became a new tool for anti-CAA protest when the DMK president MK Stalin and Lok Sabha member M Kanimozhi tweeted photographs of the patterns outside their houses. In Chennai, several lawyers and anti-CAA activists were arrested after they tried to paint Kolams allegedly without police permission.Collective enthusiasm during political movements in Kolkata started looking for new tools or languages, especially after #Hokkolorob at Jadavpur University, six years ago. The Bangladeshi song got a fresh lease of life when student movement started to galvanize around the two words. “It showed that student movements need new languages and tools to gain a momentum. #HokKolorob was markedly different from the traditional ways of protest as it had contemporary elements,” said Debabrata Roy of No NRC Movement.“Such tools can even be effective in districts where people can register their protest with a small but powerful gesture. These tools work more as sparks during movements and help to integrate mass movements across a country,” said Kamal Sur, one of the conveners of No NRC Movement. “We shall take a call on using Kolam in next few days before we spread the movement in districts,” Sur said.“Kolam can be a powerful tool to protests. Alpana has been a tradition in Bengal and it gels with the state’s ethos. We have tried to fuse newer forms like flash protests and skits to make protests more appealing,” said Suman Sengupta of Sahaman. “We are taking out weekly protests across the city. Skits like Madhusudan Dada have been popular with the protesters. We will now bring in elements of Kolam,” he added.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064410,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-642676,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-finds-new-protest-tool-in-kolam/articleshow/73062530.cms

142,['2/01/2020'],Probe team files 1st chargesheet in Koodathayi multiple murders,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Kozhikode: The special investigation team (SIT) probing the Koodathayi serial murder case filed its first chargesheet in the case involving the murder of Roy Thomas — the first husband of prime accused Jolly Joseph — before the Thamarassery judicial first class magistrate court on Wednesday.

The 1,800-page chargesheet names Jolly Joseph (47) along with three others as accused. Jolly’s relative and jewellery employee M S Mathew and goldsmith P Prajikumar, who provided sodium cyanide, which was used to murder Roy, has been arraigned as second and third accused.

Former CPM local secretary of the Kattangal unit K Manoj Kumar has also been named as an accused for his alleged role in helping Jolly to forge documents including a fake will to grab family property.

The accused have been charged under 10 sections of the IPC, including murder, criminal conspiracy, forgery and cheating apart from sections 6 (2) of Indian Poison Act.

The chargesheet has named 246 witnesses and also had 322 documents and 22 material objects (thondi). The witnesses consist of 26 officials, including three judicial officials. The chargesheet says the cyanide used for the murder has been recovered from the Ponnamattom house of Jolly.

The case pertained to the murder of Roy Thomas, which was the third in the six killings of family members allegedly by Jolly over a period of 14 years, mostly by poisoning the victims using cyanide. The other victims included Roy’s parents Annamma Thomas and Tom Thomas, Roy’s uncle Mathew Manchadi and wife and two-year-old daughter of Jolly’s second husband Shaju.

According to the chargesheet, Jolly murdered Roy by mixing sodium cyanide in chickpea (kadala curry) and water at their house on September 30, 2011. Roy was found dead in the toilet and it was initially claimed to be due to heart attack. Though the doctor who did the postmortem had raised suspicion of cyanide poisoning which was confirmed later in the postmortem report, the case was not probed further then. Roy is the only person among the six deceased family members on whom a postmortem was done.

The case was investigated by investigation team led by Kozhikode rural SP, K G Simon and Crime Branch DySP R Haridasan.

Simon said the SIT has obtained clear evidence against the accused in the case and has submitted the chargesheet with a sense of pride.

“We have been able to build up a good case and conduct the investigations in a good manner. We have recordical evidence for each and every charges against the accused. Also, we have recorded confessions of six persons, including that of two sons of Jolly, under Section 164,” he added.

The chargesheet says the Jolly plotted and carried out the murder of Roy as she thought that he was of no use to the family as he had no job and had a history of alcohol abuse. Also, there was also the motive to get control of the 38.5 cents of family property.

Simon said there was no need for DNA test results in the Roy case as postmortem certificate and chemical analysis report had revealed the presence of cyanide in the body. Also, the fake will forged by Jolly to get father-in-law’s property is expected to become a crucial evidence in the case

The chargesheet builds up the case by mentioning the earlier murders of Roy’s parents as it is linked with his murder as well. “Jolly began the killings to cover up the pile of lies she had told to family members about her education and other things. First she lied about her education to mother-in-law Annnamma, and to substantiate it she forged certificates and lied further about attending classes and getting job. She first killed Annamma to cover up the lies and when she insisted on her taking up employment. Jolly became emboldened when she found that she could get away with the murders without getting caught,” he added.

The chargesheet says though Jolly was just a pre-degree holder, she had forged certificates of BCom, MCom, UGC-NET certificates and the identity card of NIT-Calicut to substantiate her false claim of being a professor at the national institute. “We have included copies of the forged educational certificates and photograph of the NIT-C identity card as evidence,” Simon added.

Though probing the Roy murder case which was closed years back was a challenging one, the investigation focused on profiling of the accused, victimology, crime scene examination, previous and subsequent behaviour of the accused and how the crime was organised.

143,['2/01/2020'],Bathing ban in Kodiveri dam leaves tourists disappointed,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Erode: The district administration has banned bathing, fishing and coracle riding in the Kodiveri dam near Gobichettipalayam following the release of water from the Bhavanisagar dam. Visitors who came to the dam to celebrate New Year on Wednesday had to return disappointed.

The Kodiveri dam has been seeing a huge water flow after the public works department started releasing 3,000 cusecs of surplus water from the Bhavanisagar dam into the Bhavani river. “The river water has completely submerged the dam,” a PWD official said.

Considering the huge water flow, the PWD banned coracle riding, bathing and fishing activities in the dam on January 1. Many people from Gobichettipalayam, Erode and Sathyamangalam, who did not know about the ban, thronged to the dam with their children and family members.

“The officials refused to allow us near the dam,” M Matheswaran, one of the visitors, said. He lamented that he would have gone to the Bhavanisagar dam or some other tourist spots, if he had known about the ban.

Petty shopowners too were a dejected lot due to the lost business. “We have stocked goods for the New Year sale, excepting hundreds of visitors. But there was no business on Wednesday,” K Vijaya, a snack and fish stall owner, said.

The PWD said they would lift the ban once the water started receding.

Water from the Kodiveri dam is used for long-term crop cultivation in Gobichettipalayam and its surrounding villages. When the dam brims, water would be released for a period of 133 days benefitting 39,000 acres. About 24,504 acres of fertile lands in Thadapalli, Arakkankottai and its surrounding villages and another 15,000 acres of land lying across the Kalingarayan canal would be benefitted from the water release.

Aligarh Muslim University

AGRA: In the wake of the ongoing protests against the amended Citizenship Act, the authorities of Aligarh Muslim University ( AMU ) have indefinitely extended the winter vacation for its students. Even though the university was scheduled to reopen on January 6, the administration has announced on Wednesday that a fresh date will be released later.

According to the university administration, the decision to further extend the vacation was taken after a consultative meeting of the deans of faculties, principals of colleges and polytechnics, and other functionaries of the university under the chairmanship of AMU vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor.

According to controller of examinations Mujib Ullah Zuberi, a detailed schedule for opening the university in a phased manner would be notified in due course of time. He said that the examinations that could not be held in December would also be announced soon, adding that students should regularly visit the university website for updates.

Meanwhile, student leader Faizul Hasan appealed to his fellow students to return to the university. He said that the identity of the university is not about its administration but its students. “It is the fundamental right of students to fight against issues like CAA or NRC. Even though a majority of students have already made their return booking, the administration has now extended the vacation with an aim to quell protests,” he added.

Nagpur: For the first time, Central Railway has introduced fog safe device (FSD) in the interest of safety of passengers in Nagpur division.

In the last month, many passenger trains were rescheduled due to foggy weather conditions, especially in the northern parts. Several north-south trains have been arriving at least 5-15 hours late every day.

“These devices were introduced by Indian Railways in the north last year. Nagpur Central Railway has brought in 240 such portable fog safe devices for mail/express trains. Each unit costs Rs40,000 and has been to the specifications of Railways Design & Standards Organisation (RDSO),” said a senior traction operation (TRO) department official.

“FSD is a GPS-based hand-held portable device placed in the driver’s cabin. It serves as an aid for the crew during foggy weather through audio visual alarm, whenever any landmark comes within the geo-fence range, which is 500 metres ahead of the signal,” he said.

“We have introduced the device in the Nagpur-Amla-Itarsi section. Location of stations, warning boards, signals, level crossing gates and whistle for level crossing (W/L) boards in the section is fed in the equipment. It displays speed of the locomotive, distance and time to reach landmarks and is carried by the loco pilots,” said the official.

The official added that these devices are being used only in those zones of Indian Railways where the trains pass through fog-affected region. Over 7,000 FSDs have been provided to zonal railways in the north.

Margao: Villagers of Benaulim , who have been demanding that the stretch of Western bypass passing through their village be built on stilts, are pinning their hopes on the report of the inspection conducted by the Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB), water resources department (WRD), agriculture department, town and country planning department and the directorate of settlement and land records, which they believe will validate their concerns.

Following a petition to environment minister Nilesh Cabral by former sarpanch Royla Fernandes, the joint inspection was conducted to examine the environmental concerns raised by her and assess the imminent damage. The GSBB will submit the comprehensive report to Cabral.

Villagers have opposed the filling of agricultural lands to build the bypass. They apprehend flooding of their village on account of the destruction of water catchment areas.

The former sarpanch told TOI that in the absence of any study of the floodplains of Benaulim and the probable effects of new flood levels post reclamation of the land, the destruction could only be catastrophic.

147,['2/01/2020'],New Year Celebration in Bangalore: BBMP officer led drive to clear tonnes of trash from party hub before Bengaluru woke up,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Junior health inspector Santosh Raj M and his team collected over ten tonnes of trash on Wednesday

BENGALURU: Bengaluru’s hub of New Year celebrations — Brigade Road-MG Road-Church Street loop — is usually dotted with tonnes of waste, including empty liquor bottles, metal cans and food packets, on January 1. But the dawn of 2020 painted a different picture and a very pleasant one indeed. The entire area was cleaned up in such a way that none could visualise it being stomped by a massive crowd barely a few hours ago.

The drive by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike ( BBMP ) — undertaken on the lines of how normalcy is restored at New York’s Times Square after NY revelry — saw collection of over ten tonnes of trash. “Nobody would want to believe that we cleaned up the area after the big party, but the reality is that we did,” said mayor Goutham Kumar M. The drive was undertaken by 50 workers between 3am and 7am. The trash collected included over 500-600 liquor bottles, around 150 pairs of slippers and shoes, cigarette butts and some five tonnes of plastic and paper waste.

In fact, the champion of the clean-up operation was Shantalanagar (ward number 111) junior health inspector Santosh Raj M. Santosh took it up as a challenge to clean the entire stretch before the city woke up after the celebrations. Raj, 32, told TOI: “Usually, on January 1 morning, motorists on MG Road , Brigade Road and Church Street are put off by all the filth around. They start the New Year by blaming the civic agency for messed-up roads. But this time, I wanted to surprise all.”

Raj requested special commissioner (solid waste management) Randeep D to allow him to undertake a special clean-up drive on these roads. “I requested for one compactor, eight private autorickshaws and private daily wage labourers as pourakarmikas cannot come for work that early,” he said. On getting the green signal, Raj came to the spot along with his team at 2:30am, but had to wait as revellers continued to mill around. The civic team got down to action around 3am after police personnel ensured all revellers had left.

In fact, when The Ugly Indian (TUI), a citizen-volunteer group landed in front of the Metro station entrance on Church Street around 10am to commence TrashURE Hunt (wherein volunteers were to locate trash and photograph the same), they were in for a pleasant surprise. They volunteers managed to gather less than eight kg of trash, most of it dumped by three roadside tea shops in the morning. The BBMP promptly imposed a fine of Rs 3,000 on the three defaulters.

“It was very surprising to see the civic body had cleared out all the trash and ensured the most happening part of Bengaluru was sparkly clean,” said a volunteer of TUI.

“This is a great effort by our officials. But this does not mean people will keep polluting and we keep cleaning. They need to be responsible and keep their surroundings clean,” said Randeep.

<p>Punjab jail minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. (Photo credit: @Sukhjinder_INC)<br></p>

BATHINDA: Punjab jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa has ordered an investigation into the December 30 assault on a farmer union’s vice-president in Faridkot jail.

Randhawa said he had asked ADGP (jails) to find how a gangster and his henchmen beat up the inmate, Kirti Kisan Union vice president Rajinder Singh. An officer of the rank of deputy inspector general of police (DIG) has been asked to inquire into the matter and fix responsibility of the jail staff.

Speaking to TOI, Randhawa said, “I had taken up the matter with ADGP (jails) and asked him to get the matter probed. The ADGP has deputed a DIG-level officer to investigate by concentrating on talking to the inmate who was beaten up and those who were around. We will reach to the bottom of the matter and anyone found guilty of dereliction of duty will be taken to task.”

Rajinder was attacked in the jail on December 30 evening. With blunt injuries on the body, he was admitted to Guru Gobind Singh Medical College, Faridkot. Nishan Singh, who is serving a life sentence for abducting and raping a minor girl, is behind the attack. A case has been registered against Nishan and 17 others.

Farmer organisation activists KKU president Nirbhay Singh Dhudike and BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri said it was a matter of serious concern how Nishan and his accomplices were allowed to go near Rajinder, who had been fighting for justice all through his life.

While he was the president of a faction of Punjab Students Union, Rajinder was at the forefront of protests against abduction and rape of a minor girl in Faridkot by Nishan in 2012. Due to the sustained struggle by him and other activists, police had arrested Nishan from Goa along with the girl.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment in May 2013. Late,r Nishan and his mother were made to pay a compensation of Rs 90 lakh to the survivor’s family as damages. PSU activists claimed that Nishan wanted to take revenge from Rajinder for the role he played in the struggle.

Meanwhile, a four-member team of the Democratic Lawyers Association (DLA) on Wednesday met Faridkot jail superintendent and made investigations. Association member Rajiv Lohatbaddi alleged it seemed some jail officials were hand in glove with Nishan.

“We have tried to make assessment after meeting the jail superintendent and will hand over our report to the chief justice of Punjab and Haryana high court,” he said.

Though video footage available with TOI contradicts with police narratives.The FIR states that a mob of nearly 2,000 men, led by Ahmad and Faraz, gathered around 2.45pm and started threatening to kill or die claiming that the new citizenship law was passed to force a particular community to leave India.According to the FIR, ""The two men along with others were shouting anti-BJP slogans. When I attempted to stop them and tried to explain that section 144 of CrPC is in place in the area, the mob got agitated and a scuffle broke out. They manhandled us, after which I called the SHO and sought backup force.""A total of six men were booked in the FIR — Ahmad Nabi, Faraz Khan, Mohammad Hashim, Aamir, Adil and Aamir.In the FIR, sub-inspector Chitransh further claimed, ""During interrogation, the accused accepted the charges and claimed that they, under the leadership of Faraz and Ahmad, decided to attack policemen with an intention to kill them in order to protest against CAA .""However, relatives of Ahmad and Faraz vehemently denied the allegations and claimed that police are concocting a fake story to hide their brutal action. Ahmad's brother Vakeel Nabi said, ""I never heard about Faraz Khan or any other men being mentioned in the FIR along with my elder brother.""Similarly, Faraz’s uncle Azad Khan said, ""No one in our family knows about Ahmad Nabi. Police want to frame our child and other men. We have video evidence to prove that a group of 15-20 people backed by heavy police force barged inside our woodshop located near Shikohabad Adda Road close to Nalband Chouraha and vandalised our property, set it on fire and assaulted me, Faraz and our employee Gulshan Sharma along with other customers.""""The group looted Rs 1.85 lakh cash and destroyed CCTV DVR in front of policemen while we begged for mercy. They later dragged out my nephew Faraz and Gulshan Sharma out of the shop and handed them over to police. Later, Gulshan was released after his parents showed his identification card and proved that he is a Hindu,"" he added.The video of the attack on wood shop was shot by Rashid Kamal of Hajipura, who had come to Shikohabad Adda to attend his niece Sumera’s wedding. Kamal said, ""I was merely 40 feet away standing on my brother’s house’s roof while shooting the video. I saw policemen and other people barge inside the wood shop after breaking the door. They set a bike on fire in the presence of police. They later dragged out Azad Khan and his nephew Faraz Khan from the shop and rained kicks and punches in front of police. Later, they took Faraz and their employee, Gulshan Sharma, to the station"".Dakshin station house officer Dinesh Kumar Singh, under whose jurisdiction Nalband police outpost falls, said, ""Our sub-inspector has lodged an FIR. Whatever is mentioned in it, is the truth.""",agra,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064406,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-56196,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/cancer-patient-shop-owners-nephew-prime-accused-fir/articleshow/73061846.cms
152,['2/01/2020'],"1,644 banned vehicles found plying in Kolkata in November","99% of such banned vehicles are diesel-run and are potential health hazards for residents of Kolkata

TimesView Phasing out polluting vehicles is an essential part of controlling the air-quality index. The sooner we can achieve the NGT-set target, the healthier will it be for the city.

KOLKATA: Although 15-year-old commercial vehicles had been banned from plying in the Kolkata metropolitan area by Calcutta High Court way back in 2008, the state transport department’s digital checkposts detected as many as 1,644 such vehicles plying in the city in November 2019. Significantly, 99% of such banned vehicles are diesel-run and are potential health hazards for residents of Kolkata.This came to light in an affidavit filed by the Bengal chief secretary (CS), Rajiva Sinha, to National Green Tribunal. The affidavit was submitted in connection to a case filed by environment crusader Subhas Datta concrning the city’s degrading air quality and remedial measures. The affidavit stated that 67 digital checkposts fitted with high-resolution automatic number plate recognition cameras at strategic locations in the city and the different entry points to the city detected the vehicles. The affidavit said that legal action had been initiated against those vehicles.“This is irrefutable proof that a large number of highly polluting vehicles are still plying in the city. This is only the tip of an iceberg. If this was the figure for just November, the total number of vehicles plying illegally within the city must be much more. The impact of the dirty fumes on the ambient air is far worse,” Datta said.In the affidavit, the CS also stated that the E-Vahan system has been programmed to lock all commercial vehicles when they crossed 15 years. So far, fitness certificates for 3,09,201 vehicles have been locked, or marked for non-renewal of permits and issuance of certificate of fitness (CF), since 2016.However, the mere system-locking has not proved foolproof. Many of these vehicles are plying in the city without valid documents. “Either they managed to skip the scrutiny of police and motor vehicle inspectors or they managed their way by greasing the palm of the personnel,” Datta said.Earlier, the ministry of road transport and highways had informed the NGT that 2,19,137 commercial vehicles exceeding 15 years are plying in the city. However, the transport department picked holes in the claim and said that such a huge number was not plausible.“We shall keep using the digital checkposts and analysing the data with our vehicle database to zero-in on the non-compliant vehicles. They will be seized the moment they pass any of the entry-exit points of the city,” said a transport department official. Last year, the transport department detected 15,000 such vehicles at these digital check posts.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064471,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-444668,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1644-banned-vehicles-found-plying-in-kolkata-in-november/articleshow/73062554.cms

KOZHIKODE: The chargesheet filed in the Roy Thomas murder case reveals the chilling details of the meticulous planning which prime accused Jolly Joseph carried out to kill her husband by lacing his food with sodium cyanide .

Jolly mixed cyanide in the chikpea (kadala) curry and as a backup added cyanide to the water she had kept for Roy in case he skipped dinner. “On the night of the murder, she laced kadala curry with cyanide and also added it to Roy’s water in case he skipped dinner as he had a habit of drinking a glass of water on returning home, Kozikode rural SP K G Simon said.

He said that to ensure that the children do not consume the poisoned food, she took them upstairs early and put them to sleep.

Jolly had also washed the dishes before she called the relatives to inform about Roy’s death and told them that he had suffered a heart attack, Simon said. He said that she had told only one witness that Roy had eaten dinner at home. “She had told all others that Roy didn’t take dinner and that she was cooking eggs for him,” Simon said.

The SP said that she didn’t inform the children on their father’s death in the night. It was only in the next morning when the children asked about the pandal being erected outside the house that she told them about Roy’s death.

Simon said that Jolly had also tried to stop the exhumation of the bodies of the six deceased.

“The first thing that we checked was her claim that she was a professor at NIT. When we found that it was fake, we sensed that things were not right,” the SP added. Police have collected evidence of bank transactions, fabricated educational degrees and details of how fake ID card of NIT-C to sustain the web of lies and deception in her life.

Representative image

NAGPUR: A 72-year-old woman was duped of Rs 21.75 lakh by four persons, including a trickster posing as her son, who sold her plot by using her fake death certificate between December 2016 and February 2018.

Wathoda police registered a case of fraud and forgery against four persons on Tuesday following a complaint from Bhavna Kulkarni, a resident of Jai Prakash Nagar .

The accused have been identified as Bhimrao Wagde, Ashwin Wanjari, Vikas Choure and one unidentified person who posed as Rajesh Kulkarni, Bhavna’s son.

Police said Bhavna’s husband Sudhakar owned a plot, the market value of which is around Rs21.75 lakh, at Wathoda. After Sudhakar’s death, Bhavna owned the police as the couple does not have any children.

In December 2016, Rajesh made a fake death certificate of Bhavna and presented it before the government official making himself owner of the plot.

Rajesh later gave power of attorney of the plot to Wagde and also sold the plot to him. While selling the plot, Wanjari and Choure were the witnesses. Wagde later sold the same plot to Wanjari, who later sold it to another person.

In February 2018, when Bhavna went to see her plot, she found that some person is constructing a house on it. When she inquired, Bhavna came to know that her plot has been sold.

She later approached Wathoda police station where a case was registered after primary inquiry. Police are yet to make any arrests in the case.

It is learnt that cops are now focusing on arresting Wagde, Wanjari and Choure as it will help them identify Rajesh.

155,['2/01/2020'],Govt plans to set up 3000 cow sheds this year,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Bhopal: The state government is keen to set up 3000 cowsheds in 2020. After chief minister Kamal Nath gave this target to animal husbandry department, the officials are working overtime to accomplish the tas. The animal husbandry minister Lakhan Singh Yadav said that as per the CM’s instructions, 3000 cow sheds would be constructed this year and the process to identify the places has already begun. The work would start after bhoomi pujan in the next one or two months, he said.

The cowsheds are being set up to fulfill the party’s poll promise. When asked how many cow sheds have been opened in the state so far, the minister said that over 500 have been opened and the figure is set to cross the 700 hundred mark in the next two months.

The state government on Wednesday announced that 78 cow shelters will be set up through forest committees. The fund of Rs 15 crore for 50 cow shelters to be constructed at the rate of Rs 30 lakh per cow shelter and Rs 8.4 crore for remaining 28 cow shelters has already been earmarked from the dividend amount payable to Laghu Vanopaj Sangh and forest protection committees respectively, officials said, adding that proper forest areas are being selected for fodder production in collaboration with the joint forest management committees.

The government has come up with a ‘sustainability model’ for cow sheds, where it aims to make over 100 products from cow produce to meet routine expenditure of gaushalas. Most of the products would be from cow dung like hawan items, flower pots, manure, incense sticks and other items of daily use. The proceeds will take care of the expenses of food, medication and maintenance, said an official.

However, there are still a few major issues that need to be dealt with by the government. Though a year has elapsed since coming to power, the state government has not been able to come up with a land allotment policy for cow shelters in the state. As per the proposed gaushala land allotment policy which would be tabled in cabinet soon, the amount of land allotted would depend upon money invested. Investors would have to open cow shelters with capacity of at least 2,000 cows to get government land.

Corporates that have showed interest to take up cattle breeding and cowshed projects are reluctant to invest in the absence of clarity on land allotment policy and government’s assistance for the project. Officials said the process has gained pace after the CM’s directive to open 3000 cow sheds this year. Districts authorities have also been directed to get the land identifying process completed soon so that work can be started, officials said.

Bhopal: State public relations minister P C Sharma said on Wednesday that the Congress government will work in ‘20-20 style’ (alluding to a cricket format).

“In one year, we have proved our intention of fulfilling what had promised to the public. The Kamal Nath-led government will work in 20-20 style during the entire year beginning today. Good governance and development will be the main objective of the government,” said Sharma.

The minister also said that the chief minister will hold one-to-one meetings with officials Kanal Nath on January 3 to chalk out plan for the year. It will be followed by a cabinet meeting on January 4, he added.

The government plans to tweak the rules for 10% reservation to economically weaker sections (EWS) from the general category in the state.

“For the poor from general category, the government has decided to relax all norms, barring the minimum annual income criteria of Rs8 lakh. The prospective beneficiaries will only be required to submit their income certificate and the other conditions will be scrapped,” said Sharma, adding that the government has taken up several welfare initiatives for poor, which have proved extremely successful.

As of now, a candidate wanting to avail reservation benefits should not own agricultural land more than five acres or 1,200 sq ft plot under municipal corporation limits; 1,500 sq ft plot under municipality limits; or a house or more than 1,800 sq ft plot under panchayat limits. Various certificates are also required.

The general administration department (GAD) has drafted a proposal, which has been forwarded to the chief minister’s office to get the official consent. The new reservation rules will come into force soon, said sources.

The BJP, however, took a dig at the government’s plans.

“It was PM Narendra Modi-led Central government, which passed the bill for EWS reservation in Parliament and executed the same. The Congress’s one-year rule in MP is good enough to show how people of the state are suffering the consequences of poor development,” said BJP state spokesperson, Deepak Vijayavargiya.

AGRA: Amid his stand-off with Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan over the developments at the Indian History Congress in Kannur recently, eminent historian Irfan Habib on Wednesday said that he had interrupted the former’s speech as he was misquoting Mahatma Gandhi and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and attributing words to them to insult the Muslim community.

Habib said that the governor was wrongly attributing statements to Azad and Gandhiji to claim that they said such things. He added that, as a historian, he knew that the leaders never made such remarks. He further added that he would have reacted in the same manner had anybody made such “inappropriate remarks” against the community.

The historian said, “I only stopped the governor from abusing the sacrifices of these great leaders. Even the audience raised objection to the same.”

On being asked about breaking protocol, Habib said that police should not have been deployed in the room in the first place as per the rules of IHC .

When asked about the allegations that the historian tried to physically push the governor, he said, “I just pushed the guards back and walked towards him.”

However, Habib admitted that he asked the governor to quote Nathuram Godse as he was not ready to stop speaking about Maulana Azad and Mahatma Gandhi.

160,['2/01/2020'],"Punjab: Show original ownership in revenue records, says panel","This story is from January 2, 2020

Encroachments on govt land are a serious issue in Punjab

CHANDIGARH: Noticing that possession of waste lands, riverbeds and fallow lands across Punjab continued to be shown in ‘ khasra girdawari ’ on the name of a person “surreptitiously”, the Punjab revenue commission has recommended that possession should be recorded in favour of the original owner like the municipal corporations, municipal councils, nagar councils or village panchayats.

Illegal encroachment of government land has been a serious issue in Punjab. Even forest and wildlife minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot had in April 2018 claimed that 28,600 acres of forest land was under illegal possession of “politically influential persons” across the state.

“It has generally been noticed that when a person other than the owner is in occupation of land in some capacity or the other like tenant or unauthorised occupation, his possession continues to be shown in ‘khasra girdwari’ even though the general rule is that ‘possession follows title’,” observed the commission headed by Justice S S Saron (retired).

The commission added it affects proprietary rights of owners which include even the state government, municipal corporations, municipal councils, nagar councils and gram panchayats particularly in respect of ‘shamlat deh’ land.

Khasra girdawari is a revenue document in which the patwari (revenue officer), on the basis of harvest inspection done twice a year, makes entries like name of land owner, land cultivator, land or khasra number, area of land, nature of land like cultivated or non-cultivated, source of irrigation, crop sown and revenue rate.

The revenue commission said the Supreme Court has held in ‘ Gurunath Manohar Pavaskar vs Nagesh Siddapa Navalgund’ case, “a revenue record is not a document of title. It merely raises a presumption in regard to possession. Presumption of possession and/or continuity thereof, both forward and backward, can also be raised under Section 110 of the Evidence Act”.

In another case, Nair Service Society Ltd Vs KC Alexander, the Supreme Court held: “Possession may prima facie raise a presumption of title no one can deny but this presumption can hardly arise when the facts are known. When the facts disclose no title in either party, possession alone decides.”

The apex court had also made the law clear in “Chief Conservator of Forests vs Collector”, holding that it certainly does not mean that because a man (or government body) has title over some land, he necessarily is in possession of it. It in fact means that if at any time a man with title was in possession of the said property, the law allows the presumption that such possession was in continuation of the title vested in him. Therefore, the revenue commission has recommended to the Punjab government, “In respect of fallow lands or lands where no cultivation is done, the possession should invariably be recorded in favour of the owner as shown in the revenue record.”

161,['2/01/2020'],How rural panchayats can take giant strides for development,"This story is from January 2, 2020

The story of Odanthurai panchayat in Coimbatore has now become sort of folklore in rural development. Located 40km from the urban agglomeration, it has a windmill generating eight lakh units of power every year. The green power is enough and more for the village with a population of about 10,000. The surplus is sold to Tangedco.

Closer to Coimbatore, Kurudampalayam panchayat had set new benchmarks in solid waste management, much before the country woke up to the Swachh Bharat mission. Down south in Theni, a former woman panchayat president has made everyone pay tax.

These panchayats have become case studies of self-governance and attract teams of civic body chiefs, government officials and NGOs looking for possible emulation of the model. Much of the credit for the making of these rural role models goes to the visionary panchayat chiefs who have shown what local governance means and what panchayat presidents are capable of in nation building.

""Developing a village is not a tough task. All it takes for a panchayat president is honesty and strong will. The constitution provides us everything else,"" says R Shanmugam. When he took over as panchayat president in 1996, the tax revenue of Odanthurai was just Rs20,000. Within a year, he increased it to Rs1.45 lakh by making everyone comply with taxes. By the end of his second term in 2001, the village had a corpus of Rs1.5 crore with which a windmill was installed. By that time the panchayat had also turned into a hutless one with pucca houses on either side of neatly laid roads.

Chandra Pichai, former panchayat president of Thirali in Madurai district, managed to make the panchayat 100% tax compliant. Chandra who took over in 2011, shortly after the state suffered a severe power crisis, installed solar streetlights across the village.

Despite the significance of grassroots governance, political parties are seemingly apathetic to rural local body elections. While some parties view the polls as a means to gain strength ahead of assembly elections, some like Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), which spoke about the importance of grama sabhas, are staying away from the civic polls. MNM founder Kamal Haasan justified the boycott saying corruption would come into play in civic polls leaving them devoid of a level playing field. But the DMK too does not seem keen in the contest.

Panchayat raj expert and Gandhigram University professor G Palanithurai says both the DMK and the AIADMK are aware of the significance of rural local bodies. ""But this time the elections are different,"" he says. The parties are more concerned about assembly elections and have adopted different strategies. ""The AIADMK wants to put a party man in every village ahead of assembly elections. The DMK’s approach is to keep the protest momentum alive till the assembly elections and win the polls. Once they form the government, local body chiefs irrespective of their political affiliation have to fall in line with the ruling party,"" he says.

Experts, however, say it is time panchayat presidents are given enough autonomy granted to them by law. Political and bureaucratic interference in the functioning of panchayat presidents is a norm rather than an exception. And the first casualty of such political interference is clean local governance. Panchayat presidents also face non-cooperation from the community, particularly in villages with deep-rooted caste hegemony.

Palanithurai says the primary function of the panchayat chief is to work for economic development of the village. Second, to administer social justice, then democratizing community and finally involving the community in governance. ""But this is easier said than done,"" he says.

Not always are panchayat chiefs efficient. From managing funds disbursed by the state and Union finance commissions along with the village’s self-generated revenue and funds allotted for specific schemes, to preparing plan documents, the responsibilities of a panchayat president are vast. ""He should be a people’s person and at the same time should be able to interact with the MLAs, MPs and senior bureaucrats,"" says Shanmugam.

Experts say the government should begin training panchayat presidents. ""Nowhere are panchayat presidents trained. The powers bestowed on them are ample and so are the responsibilities. They need training in rules, regulations, fund management and administration,’’ says S Singarayar, programme leader of Madurai-based Dhan foundation, who has conducted training for women panchayat chiefs.

Kochi: The age-old debate over liturgy in Syro-Malabar Church has become active again with reports about the Synod of the Church, set to be held from January 7 to 15 here, having liturgy as an item in its agenda.

Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese has constituted a special liturgical committee and would hold a meeting at Kaloor Renewal Centre on Thursday to discuss the issue with the laity, sources said.

The issue pertains to the difference in conducting masses in dioceses under the Syro-Malabar Church (SMC). In Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese (and most other dioceses to the north of Ernakulam), the celebrant faces the laity during the mass.

However, Changanassery Archdiocese (and most dioceses to the south of Ernakulam) has the celebrant facing the altar during the service.

“What we understand now is that one among the detail in the agenda of the upcoming synod is to create a uniform liturgy. The text of the liturgy is the same for all under the SMC. Some of the options in the text are being used by dioceses like the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese to conduct the service facing the public, just like the global Catholic Church. We want to continue with this. If at all there is a need for uniformity, then it is better for the other dioceses to also adopt our way,” said a priest of the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese. In Malankara Syrian churches (Jacobite and Orthodox), the celebrant faces the altar while the Latin catholic church has the celebrants facing the laity.

Official sources with the Syro-Malabar Church said the agenda of the synod is yet to be released. “They (Ernakulam-Angamaly priests) might have got a hint about it (agenda) from discussions held at respective dioceses ahead of the synod. However, it is too early to comment on it as even the agenda is not out,” said an official source.

Meanwhile, Almaya Munnettam (laity uprising), an organization of the laity at Ernakulam Angamaly archdiocese, said in a communiqué that the liturgy reformation is to hide the delay in restitution in connection with the losses incurred by the archdiocese in the controversial land deals.

The group demanded a continuation of the liturgy presently in place in the archdiocese and immediate implementation of restitution.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: A 37-year-old woman from Chennai, who set herself ablaze outside Panjagutta police station on Tuesday, succumbed to burns on Wednesday while undergoing treatment at Osmania General Hospital. She had suffered 78% burns

Following the death of Lokeshwari, police altered the case from Section 309 (attempt to commit suicide ) to sections 417 and 420 (cheating) and 306 (abetting the commission of suicide) of the IPC. A case was booked against Praveen Kumar, the city-based businessman, and her partner. Police teams went to his house in Warasiguda but it was locked.

On Tuesday night, Lokeshwari’s dying declaration was recorded by a magistrate at the hospital. Before setting herself on fire, Lokeshwari wrote a petition addressing Panjagutta police. “She stated that Praveen had duped her. Lokeshwari alleged that Praveen exploited her by promising to marry her,” Panjagutta ACP Tirupatanna said.

Lokeshwari married Srinivas in 2000. He deserted her a few years later. In 2012, she met Praveen, a mining businessman. In 2013, Praveen set up a jewellery store in Somajiguda and appointed Lokeshwari as its manager. In 2014, Praveen lodged a complaint against Lokeshwari alleging that she stole 23.5 tola gold from the shop. Lokeshwari was arrested and later they made a compromise at the Lok Adalat.

“In the petition, Lokeshwari claimed that Praveen had promised to give Rs 7.5 lakh to her as he had lodged a false theft case against her and got her personal jewellery worth Rs 7.5 lakh. As Praveen was avoiding her, Lokeshwari got vexed and ended her life,” the ACP said.

LIP MLA Simrajit Singh Bain in Patiala on Wednesday

PATIALA: As the state cabinet recently gave an in-principle approval to amend the Punjab Village Common Land (Regulation) Rules, 1964, to create land banks in rural areas to boost industrial development, Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) MLA Simarjit Singh Bains on Wednesday said his party would fight the amendments as it was an attempt to grab village common land.

Interacting with media here, Bains said 18,000 industrial units in Punjab were lying shut and no effort was being made to revive these.

“If the government is serious about industrialisation, it should acquire land as per the existing policy,” the MLA said.

He said land was being grabbed in the name of industrialisation, while the fact remained that politicians were now eying village common lands even as the Punjab Village Common Land (Regulation) Rules, 1964, clearly stated that common land could not be transferred in the name of an individual. “LIP will soon file a contempt petition in the high court,” he said.

Bains added that LIP had decided to launch a statewide campaign against theproposal.

Bhopal: In the ongoing campaign to mobilise support for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), BJP national president and Union home minister, Amit Shah will visit the state on January 12. Shah will address a public meeting and also interact with people to create awareness on CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The party will also urge the protesters to shun violence in the name of anti-CAA demonstrations.

“Congress and other opposition parties are spreading canard on Citizenship Amendment Act, but the BJP has decided to counter it by bringing out the truth. BJP national president Amit Shah is arriving in Jabalpur on January 12 to address a public meeting and also to interact with the people of Jabalpur and Mahakaushal on this issue,” said BJP state president Rakesh Singh on Wednesday.

Besides, Shah is also likely to give a message to the party workers that Rakesh Singh would continue as the state chief.

Singh said that Shah’s visit coincides with the party's state-wide campaign against the failures of Congress-ruled state. “Shah is likely to give a message on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the NDA government is committed to the welfare and development of the public. The objective is to secure the country's border and to safeguard the country's honour,” said Singh.

The BJP is all set to launch a series of events across the state to support CAA and NRC from January 3. Party leaders said that apart from awareness campaign, outreach programme to connect people, discussions with the common man and intellectuals, signature campaign in favour of CAA, foot march, rallies and felicitation programmes will be held throughout the month, said Singh.

“Apart from awareness campaign, the BJP will also urge the demonstrators who were damaging public and private property in the name of protest, to shun violence and resort to peace to extend moral support against the atrocities committed against the minority Hindus residing in neighbouring states,” disclosed a senior BJP state functionary.

BJP has plans to connect 3 crore people under the campaign for which 10 lakh workers and leaders have been assigned the task. By January end, details of the campaign, its effect and feedback will be collected by the national leadership.

The party will also prepare videos of refugees and minority people who had come to India from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and their sufferings during their stay under government torture. The workers have also been asked to contact social media groups with more than one lakh followers or subscription, said sources.

167,['2/01/2020'],Stay in Pakistan to understand pain of Hindus: UP BJP chief,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Swatantra Dev Singh

AGRA: Hitting out at Akhilesh Yadav for opposing NPR and NRC, Uttar Pradesh BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh on Wednesday said that the Samajwadi Party chief should go and stay in Pakistan for some time to understand the atrocities faced by Hindus there.

Singh also asserted that the amended Citizenship Act was not against the poor and accused Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra of misguiding people on the law.

State BJP chief said, “Akhilesh should stay in Pakistan for a month and pray in Hindu temples. Then he will have first-hand experience of atrocities committed on Hindus there.” He added that the SP chief should also read about CAA and NPR in depth. “He is unnecessarily protesting against the Act.”

Singh’s remarks came after Yadav on December 29 said that the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) were against the poor and minorities of the country, while asserting that he will not fill up the NPR form.

Talking to mediapersons in Vrindavan , Singh said that there is nothing wrong in NPR as it provides simple options like presentation of Aadhaar card or driving licence to confirm that a person is a bonafide resident of the area. He also accused Akhilesh of ignoring his party's workers and promoting his family members.

Attacking Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi for her visit to riot victims’ houses, Singh said that her aim was to misguide them and create a ruckus. He added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah are only trying to provide a respectable life to people affected by atrocities in Pakistan through the new citizenship law. He also urged parties and students to go through the details of CAA well before protesting against the Act.

Mangaluru: The Central Bureau of Investigation has in a letter lauded the role played by a Mangaluru East police station inspector in the arrest of a notorious fraudster wanted by Interpol–Sam Peter.

A routine police check by Maruti S V, sub-inspector, and his team, had helped to nab eight members of the notorious inter-state gang, who posed as officials of the National Crime Investigation Bureau, involved in cheating and extortion from vulnerable people. T Sam Peter, 53, a resident of Koyilad in Kerala, and currently staying at End Point in Manipal, was the mastermind behind the gang. Peter, who was under the Interpol and CBI scanner, had committed 14 major offences, which are registered in more than six states including Karnataka. In Maharashtra he was a proclaimed offender of the state. Sam Peter had come to Mangaluru over two issues. One among them was to target a Goud Saraswat Brahmin pontiff.

In the letter, Raguramarahan A, head of branch, CBI, stated that Sam Peter also knows as Rajesh Robinson or Rahul Peter, was declared as a proclaimed offender by the CBI court in a special case. “With dedicated efforts you have arrested Sam Peter in a criminal case and further traced his involvement in a CBI case and informed the same to the CBI for necessary action. Searching for his name in other cases and informing CBI of the same is the epitome of dedication of a police officer. Your zeal and enthusiasm is a source of motivation for others and highly appreciable,” the letter read.

The central agency was on the lookout for Sam Peter from the past 18 years. His alias Rahul Peter is listed in the most wanted Interpol list from 2001, and a red corner notice was issued against him.

Lawyers stood in solidarity against CAA, NRC and NPR for over an hour

NAGPUR: After a break of about a week, a protest against citizenship law was held in the city with around 30 to 40 lawyers standing in solidarity with the nationwide opponents of the legislation outside the Nyay Mandir in Civil Lines on Wednesday.

Demanding scrapping of the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), the lawyers said the law is as much anti-Hindu as it is against the Muslims.

They slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah for creating rift among communities to hide their failure in tackling core issues of price rise, faltering economy, lack of jobs and ensuring safety of women.

They said people were being misled but the government but it can't “fool” them as they know the law.

Akshay Samarth said if government troubles the minorities here, “our people outside the country will face problems”. “This is an act of polarization. We are a secular nation having unity in diversity. The Act is violation of Article 5. We won’t tolerate this and won't allow this to happen,” he said.

Tarun Parmar said the BJP wants to take away the rights of real voters as they don’t have any. “An artificial wave was created to make Modi the PM. Their success is based on EVM tampering. They are doing this to ensure they always remain in power,” he said.

Ravi Gavai said ultimately poor people will stand in queues to prove citizenship. “The Act is not just anti-Muslim but also anti-Hindu. Look at Assam how 15 lakh Hindus brothers were harassed. This will cause problems for those who migrated, married women the most. Since we know the law, we understand what the problem is,” he said.

SB Meshram said crime rate is increasing but the government is behaving as if this (illegal immigrants) is the only problem. “There are many important issues where government must focus to improve lives. What about other neighbouring countries who are not included in the Act,” he asked.

The Boulevard Street which connects New Market to Mata Mandir

BHOPAL: Boulevard street , connecting one end of smart city development to another, was opened for public transport here on Wednesday. The project lays the foundation of civil infrastructure work for the core area of Bhopal ’s smart city development in TT Nagar.

MP minister for public relations and MLA from Bhopal Dakshin-Pashmin, PC Sharma, opened the road for the public once again. It had been closed for public movement for about three months.

“Smart city construction, which was delayed, has gathered pace. The fast-paced construction of Boulevard street is an example. Some distress caused by the development has been well worth the wait. The government will fully support completion of smart city development in time,” said Sharma.

Traffic connecting Mata Mandir to New Market has been closed for over three months as the underground duct for services was to be constructed.

The street will connect TT Nagar to Jawahar Chowk and then via a small turn will connect to smart road to Polytechnic Square.

“The underground duct has been laid. About 70% of the project has been completed. About 200 metre of construction work is to be completed out of 1,600 metres,” said Bhopal Smart City Development Corporation Limited (BSCDCL) city engineer, OP Bhardwaj.

Recognising the need to limit vehicle use and promote non-motorized transport (NMT). Boulevard Street will also have a cycle track of about 1.73 km. The concept is to segregate slow and fast-moving vehicles and providing designated safe spaces for pedestrians in the form of footpaths.

Street vendors, trees and street lights are all carefully placed along the roadside to create the feel of a ‘boulevard’, thus effectively separating motorised and non-motorized traffic, he added.

Vellore: Within hours of a video of an octogenarian differently-abled woman afflicted with leprosy seeking the Tirupattur collector’s intervention to get her monthly old age pension (OAP) approved was taken to his knowledge, collector M P Sivanarul ensured she got her sanction order delivered at home in Arpandakuppam near Vaniyambadi in the district by Tuesday afternoon.

Mohan, 40, a resident of Arpandakuppam, who helped the woman get monthly financial assistance, said, “Hamsa, 85, was born with locomotor disorder and was a spinster. Her sister-in-law, who was taking care of her after receiving the OAP for the past two decades, abandoned her when she was diagnosed with leprosy five years ago. She was undergoing treatment in Chennai for more than two years and her OAP was cancelled. She was leading a miserable life without food and medical assistance as she didn’t get her monthly financial assistance.”

Kumar, 54, another villager said, “Appalled after seeing Hamsa’s condition, the villagers under the guidance of Mohan decided to help her and took efforts to get her the OAP. However, officials at the Tirupattur social welfare department rejected our petitions, demanding that we bring the applicant (Hamsa) in person.

As a final attempt, Mohan on Tuesday recorded a 20-second video asking Hamsa to make a direct plea for her monthly assistance and forwarded it to collector Sivanarul and revenue officials in the social welfare department. Officials, including the collector, who were troubled on seeing the video, directed Mahalakhsmi, Vaniyambadi social welfare department tahsildar, to sanction her the OAP.”

Speaking to TOI Mahalakshmi said, “The villagers came with a new petition around 11am on Tuesday, and from the office they forwarded Hamsa’s video to the collector. Sivanarul, responding to the WhatsApp video, directed us to sanction Hamsa the OAP and the order was handed over to her at her house before 1pm. As we knew that Hamsa was struggling without even a change of clothes, we gave her a saree and presented her sweets and a cake box ahead of the New Year.”

The humanitarian act of the villagers and the tahsildar was widely appreciated on social media.

Government Railway Police DSP Babu said that two weeks ago, two sovereigns of gold jewels were snatched from Mageshwari, a passenger on Nilgiri express plying between Chennai and Coimbatore when the train was crossing Jolarpet railway station . Similarly, a three-sovereign gold chain was snatched from Rohini of Bengaluru when she was travelling in an express when the train was crossing Pachur railway station. A week ago, Rs 2,500 and a cellphone were snatched from Mani of Bengaluru when he was travelling in Cauvery express. Following the series of robberies, three special teams were formed to nab the culprits.”

On Tuesday evening, when the Jolarpet GRP were conducting patrolling on platform 2 in Jolarpet railway station, they spotted Deepjothi and Sanjurai loitering in a suspicious manner. Police took them to the Jolarpet GRP station for inquiry and based on their confession, arrested two more of their associates.

177,['2/01/2020'],Phoolka wants gurdwaras to run ‘medicine langar’,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Amritsar: Noted lawyer and former AAP MLA H S Phoolka has sought intervention of the acting jathedar of Akal Takht to issue directions to every gurdwara in Punjab to begin a weekly medicine langar to provide basic health services at doorstep in every village.

Phoolka, who won from Dakha assembly constituency in January 2017 before resigning in October 2018, handed over a memorandum at the Akal Takht secretariat on Wednesday.

Later, talking to media, Phoolka said his organisation Gyan Sewa Trust had been successfully running a mobile dispensary in 20 villages in Dakha and covered four villages every day.

“Around 300 patients converge to gurdwaras to take medicines from the mobile dispensary, which visits every gurdwara once in a week,” he said.

Phoolka claimed that 75% villages of Punjab didn’t have government dispensaries and they was always a shortage of medicines or doctors in the rest.

“We have observed that a majority of patients had issues of high blood pressure, diabetes, vitamin D deficiency etc. But, due to abject poverty, they can’t even afford medical treatment,” he added.

He said he did not expect the Punjab government to provide primary medical care at the grassroots. He appealed to religious personalities to intervene and encourage communities to come forward to help provide medical facilities where governments had failed to do so. “I have urged the jathedar of Akal Takht to issue directions to every gurdwara to begin a weekly medicine langar and ask doctors to provide free medical services once in a week,” said he.

Quoting his trust’s experience, he said the monthly expenses on medicine langar comes to around Rs 20,000 . “People from almost every village have gone abroad and they wouldn’t mind extending a help of $300 a month, which will also take the financial burden off gurdwaras,” he said.

Bathinda: Protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) continued on the first day of 2020 as activists of Punjab Students Union, Naujawan Bharat Sabha and Aam Aadmi Party’s student wing Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Samiti (CYSS) held demonstrations in colleges across Punjab under the banner ‘Young India campaign against NRC, NPR, CAA’.

Protests were held at Nehru Memorial College, Mansa; industrial training institute (ITI), Guru Har Sahai in Ferozepur; and government colleges in Malerkotla and Sangrur.

A protest was also held at Mastuana Sahib in Sangrur. In Bathinda, All India Students Association (AISA) held protests at Government Rajindra College and ITI. Activists of Inquilabi Naujawan Sabha and Dr Ambedkar Library and Club also participated in protests at Bathinda.

Students are demanding the rollback of CAA and scrapping of National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Rashpinder Jimmy, president of one wing of PSU, said the act is unacceptable since it is against the spirit of the Indian Constitution. “It discriminates against a particular religion. Our Constitution clearly mentions equality on the basis of class, caste, creed and religion, but the NDA government is trying to divide the country,” he said, adding that students would hold a protest at Malerkotla on January 3 and give a call for boycotting exams in all colleges of Punjab on January 8.

AISA activist Sukhjit Ramanandi said CAA was discriminatory in nature and would divide the country on religious lines. “Students of the country will never tolerate it and will continue holding protests till the Centre agrees to withdraw it,” he said.

APSRTC employees perform abhishekam to the portrait of AP chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy, in Vijayawada on... Read More

ViJAYAWADA: In a first step in the merger process of Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation ( APSRTC ) merger with the state government, more than 50,000 workers became state government employees.

In a New Year gift to workers, the government has notified the absorption of employees into the government from Wednesday.

Chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy had promised RTC workers that he would merge them into the state government if voted to power. Soon after he came to power, Jaganmohan constituted an expert committee headed by former vice-chairman and managing director (VC&MD) of APSRTC, C Anjaneya Reddy to study various aspects of the merger and suggest ways to make APSRTC economically sustainable.

The Anjaneya Reddy committee submitted its report to the government on September 3, 2019. The state government in the following cabinet meeting accepted the committee report to merge the employees into the government. Subsequently, another committee was formed with the higher officials to chalk out the merger process.

On November 1, 2019, the board of APSRTC passed a resolution authorising the state government to take over the corporation’s establishment in “as-is-where-is” condition so as to facilitate the merger process.

The state government has created a new department called ‘Public Transport Department ’ (PTD) by making necessary legislative amendments. The PTD will be under the administrative control of the Transport, Roads and Buildings Department. The government has notified that the PTD will come into existence from January 1, 2020 and all the workers of APSRTC will become government employees under PTD.

The APSRTC workers have held a thanksgiving ceremony at all 128 depots across the state on Wednesday. Transport minister Perni Venkatramaiah (Nani) participated in ‘Thank You CM’ programme held at Vijayawada . He said the YSRC government has kept its promise of merging APSRTC into the government within the shortest possible time. The state government is having many plans to make APSRTC sustainable by reducing debts and by introducing technology enabled services in the future he said. “Our aim is to make APSRTC as role model in the country offering best services to people without compromising on the welfare of employees” he said.

Mysuru: The youths should always think about the good of society and they are the real asset of the nation, said zilla panchayat CEO K Jyothi at the Yuvajanothsava here on Wednesday.

Speaking at the inaugural function of the day-long district-level youth cultural festival at Maharani’s Arts College , she said: “The youths are the powerhouse of this country and hence its future. The progress of the nation depends on youths. Hence I request them to work for the progress of the nation by cultivating and practicing good habits. This is also the age where youths tend to take everything for granted and there are chances of getting deviated. Hence there are parents, teachers and friends to guide you and get back to you on the track.”

Mayor Pushpalatha Jagannath, delivering her inaugural address, said: ‘During our student days, we didn’t have much opportunity to showcase our talent which is not the case now. The parents, even though it is difficult for them to afford, still sacrifice everything to fulfil the demands of their wards. Hence I request all of you to utilise this platform to the maximum extent to showcase your talent.”

The mayor also made use of the platform to create awareness about cleanliness and Swachh Abhiyan. “Last year, Mysuru city stood third place in the cleanest city cateogry in the country. This year, we want to make it to number one. Hence we need your support. If each school tries to keep four roads clean in their surroundings, it will do a lot of good for maintaining cleanliness in city,” she said.

In the day-long Yuvajanothsava, students and those affiliated to the department of youth empowerment and sports in the age group of 15 to 29 years are taking part. The participants will be taking part in nine different events—classical dance, classical instruments, harmonium, guitar, classical singing, debate, mono act, folk songs and folk dance. Those who secure first place in the respective event will qualify to take part in the state-level Yuvajanothsava which will be held at Shivamogga from January 3 to 5.

Mangaluru: Instead of celebrating the New Year in grandeur, a group of like-minded people led by members of Sahyadri Sanchaya and Rotaract Mangaluru City visited the offices of district representatives and officials with a gift on Wednesday.

The gift included water in a mud pot , a sapling and a cloth bag . This is to convey to the peoples representatives and officials that New Year’s should not be restricted to celebrations only, but it is the time to introspect and ponder about measures to be implemented to protect the environment.

Dinesh Holla, convener, Sahyadri Sanchaya, working for the protection of Western Ghats, told TOI, “We can expect one of the worst water crises this year. Apart from celebrating the New Year, it is also time for the officials and peoples’ representatives to plan and prevent disasters. Last monsoon was marked by landslides and destruction of the Western Ghats. We cannot afford another similar disaster. Ambient temperatures are rising and water in the river Netravati, the lifeline of Dakshina Kannada, is drying up. We expect the administration to protect the environment. This is the time for the administration to wake up and take up water conservation measures. People continue to use plastic bags, which has to be controlled.”

The delegation met deputy commissioner Sindhu B Rupesh, city police commissioner P S Harsha and Mangaluru City Corporation commissioner Shanady Ajith Kumar Hedge, and also visited the offices of MLA Mangaluru City South D Vedavyas Kamath, MP Nalin Kumar Kateel and Mangaluru South police station. They will be meeting the MLA and district minister Kota Shrinivas Poojari soon. Every gift selected had a message. The sapling stressed on the need to plant more trees and emphasised on the need for a green city. Water is to indicate that the district is heading towards one of its worst water crises and a cloth bag to request the district administration for a complete ban on the use of plastic. The saplings were provided by green crusader Madhav Ullal, who told officials that he was also willing to plant them.

“For a secure future, it is important that every individual takes up the responsibility to protect the environment,” said Holla.

183,['2/01/2020'],Bronze travellers huge draw at Mysuru station,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Mysuru: The city railway station , already a talking point for its cleanliness, is turning into a crowd-puller with the recent addition of life-size bronze sculptures in its portico, depicting the romance of rail travel.

The statuary comes about four months after a glow-in the-dark “I love Mysuru” structure was installed at the station. Both are now popular selfie points for commuters, drawing rave reviews on social media as well.

The sculpture – ‘Life is a Journey’ – depicts two men, two women and a boy and a girl in various poses, with luggage, tickets and a camera, capturing the scene at a railway station.

“‘Life is a journey’ is a celebration of the spirit of travel. We saw the redevelopment of the railway station as an opportunity to showcase the talent and vibrant art and culture of Mysuru,” said Aparna Garg, DRM of Mysuru division of South Western Railway. The statues are the work of city-based sculptor Arun Yogiraj, who also made the life-size statue of Jayachamaraja Wadiyar at Hardinge Circle and Paramahamsa at Ramakrishnanagar.

“I have made hundreds of sculptures but this was a different ball game because I had to depict the common man and travellers and needed to capture the nuances of each of them, be it adults or the children,” Yogiraj told TOI. “I studied each character in detail and carefully observed commuters for each pose. These are realistic sculptures which are seen more in foreign countries.”

Over four months, Yogiraj studied postures and gestures, built true armatures (structures for sculptures) and clay models with detailed human anatomy. After fibre modelling to get a fine finish, the statues were cast in bronze.

“Mysuru railway station looks very appealing now,” said Ramesh, a manager in a private firm in the city and a frequent traveller. “Thanks to the initiative of the railway authorities and the talented artists, the station is no less than a tourist spot.”

Dehradun: The opposition Congress on Wednesday launched a scathing attack on BJP’s Jhabreda MLA Deshraj Karanwal and independent lawmaker of Khanpur Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion and accused them of “making a mockery of democracy.” The senior Congress members were of the view that strict action was required against the two “as they had leveled serious allegations against each other, which need to be thoroughly probed.”

Senior Congress member Suryakant Dhasmana told TOI, “Both knew that they had landed in an awkward situation as Champion had challenged the SC certificate of Karanwal and the latter had accused the Khanpur legislator of using castiest remarks against him. Both feared that a thorough probe would find them guilty, so after creating much confusion, which included knocking the doors of high court, they decided to bury the hatchet.” Dhasmana said that by making truce, the “crime or illegal act performed by them did not end. The allegations need to be probed and strict action is required if charges are found genuine.”

He did not fail to mention that approaching the police or the high court is “not a joke. When matters are out of control or extremely serious, people make police complaint or raise the matter before the court. They are not common men. By striking a compromise, they are hushing the issue.”

Another senior Congress member and former state spokesperson Mathura Dutt Joshi said that “If the charges were found true, they do not deserve to sit in the state assembly. This compromise reflects that Karanwal is scared of getting caught, whereas Champion wants to make a ghar-vapasi in the BJP. The Congress wants that both allegations should be thoroughly probed to bring out the truth before the people.”

Visakhapatnam: One hundred and twenty five owners and around 500 employees of Mee Seva Kendras in the district, along with their families, are spending sleepless nights as the fate of such centres remains uncertain. On December 30 Sri Hari, a differently abled Mee Seva employee dashed off a voice message, addressing it to chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy, claiming that he would commit suicide inside his Wombay Colony office. Fortunately, his friends received the message on time and rushed to the office to rescue him.

So far although the government has not made any formal announcement about the Mee Seva Kendras, they fear that the centres might be closed as the government has decided to recruit digital assistant-rank officers in the grama sachivalayams. The role of digital assistants at Mee Seva Kendras are similar to that of the digital assistant-rank officers in the grama sachivalayams in rural areas and in ward offices in city limits. Moreover, these digital assistants have begun their operations from Wednesday and that too free of cost.

“We are not sure about the fate of our business. Even if the government does not officially shut it down, the decision to make fresh recruits would affect our business considerably. Anyway the income from this business is not high,” KVD Prasad, owner of one such centres told TOI.

There are 125 Mee Seva Kendras in Visakhapatnam districts, that have around 500 employees. In Andhra Pradesh there are around 9,000 Mee Seva Kendras with around 30,000 employees.

“If we have to shut down our business what would we do? Most of the owners or employees of these centres are undergraduates and many of them are more than 40 years old. How would they find an alternative profession?” said Nagaraju, secretary of Mee Seva Operators’ Association.

Officials of all the Mee Seva Kendres called an indefinite strike from December 22 and since then all the Mee Seva Centres have been closed.

On April 11, 2011 Mee Seva Kendres were introduced in Andhra Pradesh during N Chandrababu Naidu’s regime. The TDP government introduced such services to facilitate local residents to pay government bills like house/property tax, water tax and electricity bills and to generate employments as well.

187,['2/01/2020'],YSRC rejigs strategies ahead of local body polls,"This story is from January 2, 2020

VIJAYAWADA: YSRC is keen to wind up the local body elections even before the nitty-gritty of the capital city relocation are finalised as the party has set its focus on political management in key districts.

While it is hopeful of reaping rich dividends in Grater Visakha Municipal Corporation (GVMC) elections following chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy’s decision to make the city executive capital, the party has started reworking its strategies in Krishna, Guntur and Prakasam districts where it might find the going difficult. Although, the chief minister is determined to complete the process of setting up three capitals through a resolution in the assembly by the end of January, the YSRC strategists are suspecting the process might get delayed if it had to face legal scrutiny.

Hence, the YSRC leadership wants to hold local body elections before the formalities of the three capital cities are finished. Sources said that the decision to let TDP MLA from Guntur West Maddali Giridhar to meet the CM and extend support to YSRC was with an eye on the upcoming elections to Guntur Municipal Corporation (GMC).

Although, YSRC has its legislator Mustafa in Guntur East, the switchover of Giridhar is expected to bolster the prospects of the party as he belongs to Vysya community which has a sizeable population in the city. Although, the party enjoyed the support of majority among the minorities, BC, SC and Christians in the last elections, it is worried about losing base among these sections as the working class has been hit due to shortage of sand and slowdown in construction activity in the last six months.

In this context, the party strategists have decided to consolidate its strength among the upper-class sections in urban areas by roping in key functionaries from rival camps.

The decision to admit TDP youth leader Devineni Avinash into the party and make him the city east segment in-charge was taken with an eye on civic body elections. The party also appointed Kamma leader Boppana Bhavakumar as city party chief as part of its measures to placate Kammas. With minister Vellampalli Srinivas (Vysya) and central legislator Malladi Vishnu (Brahmin) are representing two dominant sections, YSRC is looking for a strong face from Muslim and Kapu communities to expand its footprint.

The party might also be required to promote a strong functionary from the SCs to make a visible presence among these sections in the city.

According to sources, YSRC is holding negotiations with key TDP functionaries in Prakasam district. Meanwhile, the state government has almost finalized reservations to the posts of panchayats in all the districts. Collectors have finalized the reservations and sent the lists to the government.

The state government might advance the municipal elections in case the high court did not give its green signal for increased quota for the BCs in panchayaths.

Dehradun: Long-time warring colleagues, Deshraj Karanwal and Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion, have called it a truce on the first day of new year and are now “friends forever”.

Burying their hatchet at a joint press conference in Dehradun on Wednesday, Jhabreda BJP legislator Karanwal and expelled Khanpur MLA Champion, who were fighting legal battles which often spilled over on to public arena, said they have decided to iron out their differences and “withdraw all the cases”.

“All the misunderstandings between us have been sorted out,” Champion said, amid the newly-found bonhomie. Champion was expelled from the BJP last July after a video of him dancing with guns was widely circulated.

Champion, who has now vowed to be friends with Karanwal and withdraw all the cases filed against each other, has been trying to stage a comeback in the BJP. But, sources said the police case registered against him by Karnwal had made his return difficult.

BJP sources said that Champion had sought CM’s help in resolving his differences with Karanwal which seems to have worked, at least for now, with the two men addressing the media together. Karanwal even said, “I will withdraw the cases, including the one registered under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and Champion will withdraw cases filed against me. Now, we are friends forever.”Champion had filed cases against Karanwal mainly raising questions on the validity of his SC certificates and contesting from a reserved constituency.

“He now regrets filing the cases and has promised to work constructively,” added Karanwal.

Notably, there has been “truce” in the past, too, which didn’t last for long. “The two had announced a truce at the CM’s residence last year. But, things soon fell apart. After today’s joint press conference it looks like the party wants both the legislators to work together,” said a senior BJP leader.

189,['2/01/2020'],Nepal consignments contribute to growth of Vizag Port in ’19,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Imports to the land-locked Himalayan country of Nepal played a pivotal role in the growth of Visakhapatnam port in 2019. Among the around 1,78,000 consignments imported through the port, 33, 647 of them were bound for Nepal.

“Growth at container terminal has consistently compounded at an annual growth rate of 22% since inception. The year on year growth from FY15 to FY19 has been impressive too, at 16%. Thanks to container movements to Nepal that played a pivotal role in the increase in import ,” said a senior official from Visakha Container Terminal, the sole agency responsible for handling the container terminal of Visakhapatnam Port.

Officials said, traditionally, Nepal used to import essential commodities through the Kolkata Port. It was in 2017 that customs granted permission to Nepal to import via Visakhapatnam as well. And, gradually, in 2019 the Visakhapatnam Port actually handled more imports to Nepal than Kolkata Port.

“Being a riverine port the turnaround time at the Kolkata Port is three to four days. On the other hand at the container terminal in Visakhapatnam import goods get cleared within four hours. So Nepal started importing through Visakhapatnam in 2017 and in 2019 we actually handled 52% of Nepal imports through India,” the official added.

Nepal mostly imports food products, pulses, electronic goods and machineries. A major part of these imports are from the United States of America.

“To facilitate imports to Nepal, shipping line major Maersk initiated a dedicated service in 2018 to transfer the imported commodities from Visakhapatnam to Birgunj in Nepal by train. In Birgunj the goods are handed over to Nepalese importers,” stated an official.

In fact, to provide safety and security to the goods bound for Nepal, Indian customs had introduced radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology early in 2019. All containers carrying the imported goods are fitted with this technology. It helps customs officials to locate the containers in transit wherever they are in India. “Going by the figure till December 2019, this fiscal the container terminal in Visakhapatnam is all set to cross the 0.5 million TEU mark and it goes beyond doubt that imports to Nepal played a significant role in the growth,” said an official.

Vijayawada: Residents of the city rang in the new year in style with special parties and events organised by hotels on Tuesday night. Large numbers of youth visited Mahatma Gandhi Road, which wore a festive look.

St Paul’s Lutheran Church and other churches organised a special mass to welcome the new year while some youth marked the occasion by distributing sweets and blankets to the destitute.

At Sai Baba temples near Mutyalampadu and Stella College, devotees lined up late on Tuesday night, waiting for darshan. Temple committees organised special prayers for peace and prosperity in 2020. Special prayers, however, were stalled at the Dasanjaneya Swamy temple in Machavaram where temple authorities provided ‘seeghra darshan’ to clear the rush of devotees.

“Visiting the temple on the first day of the new year and offering prayers is an old tradition. We have performed a special ‘abhishekam’ for Sai Baba and made a special offering,” said Madhava Sharma, a priest at Gunadala Saibaba Temple.

Meanwhile, city police filed 55 cases of drunk driving . Checks were held between 11 pm and 4 am at 13 major junctions and 32 two-wheelers, one autorickshaw and three cars were seized. Police also set up barricades and medians on busy roads to control rash driving.

Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Nagaraju monitored special checks across the city.

Vijayawada: While merrymaking marked new year festivities in the city, residents of the 29 villages in the Amaravati capital region painted rangolis with a ‘save Amaravati, save Andhra Pradesh’ to welcome 2020.

Farmers in the capital region skipped new year celebrations as a mark of protest against the three capital cities proposal, and instead opted to express their grievances through rangolis.

A rangoli competition with a ‘save Amaravati, save Andhra Pradesh’ theme was conducted at BRTS road by Amaravati Pari Rakshana Samithi (APRS) and Helping Hands NGO. Thirty participants from the city made rangolis highlighting the problems of farmers in the region.

“Amaravati doesn’t belong to a single community or a religion. It is the spirit of the public of the 13 districts of Andhra Pradesh. While the idea of decentralisation is appreciable, shifting the capital out of Amaravati is not acceptable. Farmers of this region sacrificed their land for the sake of the capital and have now lost their means of livelihood. I have tried to depict this through my rangoli,” said Yalamanchali Vijayalakshmi, who won a prize in the competition.

Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh Congress vice-president and APRS functionary Sunkara Padmasri said they are conducting a series of protests and programmes to explain the plight of farmers in the Amaravati capital region.

“The state government is meting out injustice to the Amaravati region in the name of decentralisation. Proposal for three capitals is baseless and we will continue our agitation till the government withdraws its proposal,” Padmasri said.

193,['2/01/2020'],Women empowerment top priority for Canadian minister with roots in Vizag,"This story is from January 2, 2020

VISAKHAPATNAM: The Jason Kenney-led United Conservative Party’s landmark victory over the New Democratic Party in Alberta, in the spring of 2019, wasn’t one of the biggest political news of the year for Canada alone. Back home too, it marked a historic moment with two people of Telugu-origin, making it to the cabinet — Prasad Panda , minister of infrastructure and Leela Sharon Aheer , minister of culture, multiculturalism and status of women.

Reportedly, both were first elected to the legislative assembly of the Canadian province, Alberta, in 2015. While Panda was born in Guntur’s Sangam Jagarlamudi village, Aheer has her roots in Visakhapatnam .

On her recent trip to the city, TOI caught up with the 49-year-old Aheer who spoke about her political journey, which began 14 years ago.

“Back then, I used to volunteer for political events but never looked at it as a career option. I was running my private business,” she said, admitting that her friends nudged her to take the plunge, given her interest in it. Following an aggressive campaign, she was elected to the Alberta assembly in 2015.

Now, on her debut run as minister, Aheer has her agenda well chalked out: women’s empowerment, both at home and in society.

“One thing that always disturbs me is the way women and children continue to be abused all over the world. It is time for real talk about the violation of human rights and speak out candidly about honour killings, human trafficking, child marriage and female genital mutilation. We need to engage all ages and genders to have conversations on how we can protect our rights,” said Aheer who declared November 19, 2019 as ‘Women’s Entrepreneurship Day’ in Alberta, at the first-ever Canada-based Women’s Entrepreneurship summit. The day aims to encourage women entrepreneurs and create opportunities for the world to recognise the many ways women contribute to the economy.

Persuading women to join politics is also on her to-do list. Incidentally, for the first time, 44% of the contestants in the 2019 elections were women. “Although 51% population of Canada comprises women, until last elections, only a handful of them joined politics. Women felt they are incapable and lacked self-confidence. Last year our aim was to encourage more women to contest,” said Aheer while assuring unity, collaboration and inclusion within her province. “Be it people who cannot speak English or are new to the country, we want them to feel at home and not alienated. I urge the youth who are our future to engage in policy because it is the need of the hour. Wonders can happen if the people and government collaborate and work for a better world to live in,” the minister said appealing to people to break down barriers of religion, caste, economic status and gender.

As the conversation veered towards India, Aheer said, “India is my second home and I feel my heart beat in India. I feel so close to my family and the people of this country, especially the South. I feel at home because I am home,” Aheer said.

VIJAYAWADA: Nostalgia marked the meeting of 40 alumni of Sri Raja Rangayya Apparao and Chunduru Venket Reddy (SRR&CVR) College who came together again four decades after they left the college campus.

Alumni of the BCom (English medium) batch of 1978, now working in various professions, had not met after they graduating from college. The idea to reunite at the college came about after former batchmates YV Krishnaiah, Y Ramesh and KJN Gupta started to trace their other classmates. After five years, they had managed to trace 56 out of 75 batchmates.

Following two futile attempts to organise an alumni meet, the three succeeded the third time around with 40 alumni from across the country, the United States and Canada recently gathering on the college premises.

Speaking to TOI, Krishnaiah said, “Coming from a commerce background, most of our batchmates worked in public sector banks. Two of them even worked for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and retired in high positions.”

The alumni spent a day on campus with two lecturers, P Krishna Murthy and K Govardan Rao, who were felicitated at the meet.

G Ramasubramanyam, an alumnus, organised a book exhibition with old textbooks.

Principal Velaga Joshi, also an alumnus of the college spoke about the developments in the college over the last four decades. Alumni members donated Rs 1 lakh to the college for the ‘Gorumuddha’ programme under which breakfast is provided to students from economically weaker sections. They also felicitated veteran librarian of the college, Lakshmaiah.

198,['2/01/2020'],AP fishermen in Pak jail may be released by Sankranti festival,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The New Year is likely to bring some happy news for the 22 fishermen from Andhra Pradesh, who were arrested by the Pakistan marine security agency on November 22, 2018 and have been languishing in a Karachi jail since then. In all probability, they would reach home by Sankranti, which falls on January 15.

North Andhra fishermen’s association confirmed the development on Tuesday after meeting officials of Union home ministry in New Delhi.

“The ministry officials informed us that as part of an exchange programme, India and Pakistan would release a few prisoners who are held up in the jails of the two countries. Both countries have prepared a list of prisoners to be released. The names of the 22 fishermen from the state is in the list prepared by Pakistan,” AP Matsyakara Samakhya president Vasupalli Janakiram told TOI.

The 22 fishermen hailing from the coastal belt of north Andhra — 17 from Matyalesa village in Srikakulam district and five from Bhogapuram in Pusapatirega mandal of Vizianagram district — had gone to Gujarat were they were hired by a fishing company based in Veraval, near Porbandar.

They had ventured into the seas in November 2018 when their boat reportedly drifted into Pakistani waters where they were apprehended by a team from the Pakistan marine security agency. They were later taken to Karachi and lodged in a jail there on charges of trespassing.

“They are expected to be released by the second week of January 2020. However, the specific dates are yet to be confirmed. They would be handed over to Indian authorities at Wagah border,” added Janakiram.

It was the first time that any fishermen from AP had been arrested by a neighbouring country for trespassing into their waters. In October last year, eight other fishermen, hailing from Thippalavalasa village in Pusapatirega mandal of Vizianagaram district, were arrested by the Bangladesh coast guard for entering their territorial waters.

Every year fishermen from the coastal districts of the state migrate to Gujarat in September and return in March as the catch is very low in the Bay of Bengal during that time of the year.

199,['2/01/2020'],Only Parliament can take final call on location of state’s capital: Legal experts,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Amaravati: A debate is on about powers of the state and Union governments in deciding the capital city of a state after chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy proposed setting up three capitals based on an expert panel’s report.

Legal experts and political parties are divided on the issue. The legal experts say only Parliament has the authority to notify the boundaries of the state as well as the capital city. They noted that the assembly could only make an appeal to the Centre on the issue of the capital city through a resolution and it is the Centre’s prerogative to take the final call.

Article 2 and Article 3 of the Constitution of India confer exclusive and plenary powers upon Parliament to form or establish or completely alter and destroy the identity of the existing states. A state legislature, as per Clause (e) of Article 3 of the Constitution, cannot even change the name of the state. It is within the exclusive domain of Parliament to form any state, set boundaries, and name a state in the Union as defined in Article 1 of the Constitution.

“The power to establish a state’s capital is inherent to, and inseparable from, the power conferred upon Parliament under Articles 2, Article 3 and Article 4 of the Constitution,” said advocate and peasant rights activist Mallela Seshagiri Rao.

The matter of establishing a capital of a new state formed by Parliament by law is not covered by any Entry in List-II of the Schedule-VII of the Constitution. It is specifically because the capital of a state shall foster the needs of all sections/strata’s of the society/residents of the state without any political discrimination as to the development of a particular region/part of such state, he explained. Therefore, only Parliament can, by law, establish the capital of a newly reconstituted state, which after reconstitution and reorganisation by enacting a law, under Article 3(a)(c)(d) of the Constitution, said Rao.

Interestingly, Parliament has not passed any legislation making Amaravati as capital city of Andhra Pradesh after the bifurcation. In fact, neither the Centre nor the state government has issued a gazette notifying the capital city of the state resulting in confusion.

The state assembly had only passed a resolution when N Chandrababu Naidu was chief minister declaring Amaravati as the capital city. Subsequently, the TDP government failed to get it cleared by Parliament in the past five years giving scope for Jaganmohan Reddy to make new plans.

Legal expert and TDP MP Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar said the state has no say in shifting the capital city.

Meanwhile, minister Botcha Satyanarayana said the government was not shifting the capital city but plans were only to decentralize development across the state in an even manner.

AMARAVATI: Kanna Lakshminarayana , president of the state unit of BJP , on Wednesday questioned how chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy could take a unilateral decision to shift the capital city without consulting all stakeholders.

Ludhiana: Four masked miscreants tied up a yarn trader and robbed him at gunpoint in Sundar Nagar on Tuesday evening.

Even as the incident took place around 6.30pm, a scared Kuldeep Singh, 53, a resident of BRS Nagar, informed police at night.

In his police complaint, Kuldeep said, “I was at office with my employee, Gurmeet Singh. As my television set was not working, I asked Gurmeet to fix its cables. Minutes after Gurmeet left, four masked men barged into my office. One of them pointed a pistol at me.”

The four tied Kuldeep up with a chair and taped his mouth.

“After snatching the drawer keys from me, they fled with Rs 80,000. Before making good their escape, they threatened me against informing the police,” he added.

After sometime, when Gurmeet returned, he released Kuldeep. The trader narrated the incident to him and asked him not to call the police.

Daresi police station SHO inspector Vijay Kumar said, “Kuldeep was too frightened to lodge a complaint. After he apprised his family of it, his son called up the police.”

As no CCTV cameras were installed at Kuldeep’s office, cops are scrutinising the ones in the area. “A CCTV has captured the four masked miscreants. They came on two bikes. It is suspected that the accused did a reconnaissance before striking, as they barged in when the trader’s employee left and he was alone in office.”

A case has been registered.

AMARAVATI: The decision of former chief minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu ’s wife Nara Bhuvaneswari to take part in a public protest programme on Wednesday has raised eyebrows as this is her first appearance in the near four-decade-long political career of her husband.

So far she was never seen at public forums either when her father NT Rama Rao or Naidu served as chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.

Meanwhile Bhuvaneswari said her husband has always put peoples’ interests ahead of his family interests. She donated her gold bangles in support of the farmers’ agitation in the capital city area. She said that she was moved by the plights of the women and decided to take part in the protest to extend moral support to them. She participated in the farmers’ dharna in Yerrabalem village along with Naidu.

Speaking to the gathering, Bhuvaneswari said that Naidu had not even taken proper care of his health as he kept himself busy with overseeing the construction of Amaravati and Polavaram projects. He worked round-the-clock for the state and their family would be with the farmers in times of difficulty.

Telangana stands at fifth place.Overall, Andhra Pradesh scored 67 out of 100 points which marginally qualifies it as a frontrunning state among all 28 states.AP’s SDG score comparatively stands higher than the national average of 60. The state also improved on its overall score by three points compared to 2018 when it was 64 qualifying it as just a ‘performer’.On the other hand, Telangana scored well in economic growth and decent work while ranking poorly in gender equality.

Some of the aspects Telangana scored over AP includes: wards with 100% door-to-door waste collection; births registered; and population covered under Aadhaar and households electrified.Of the 16 SDG indicators, AP is graded as a ‘frontrunner’ state in 11 indicators, two categories as ‘performer’ and three cases as ‘aspirant’ which is the lowest grade. AP also stands second place in terms of climate action, life below water — marine ecosystems (compared to nine coastal states in India), after Karnataka . AP stands third in terms of ‘no poverty’ with a score of 69 points.Each indicator has some sub-indicators in which there are contrasting ratings given by the SDG report. Some of the major improvements that the state witnessed under these sub-indicators include: internet subscribers, mobile tele density, habitations connected by all-weather roads under PMGSY, houses completed under PMAY, wards with 100% door-to-door waste collection, waste processed, sex ratio at birth and districts verified to be ODF.In terms of the sub-indicators, AP’s highest score of 96 comes with clean water and sanitation.

The body is quite decomposed... the man must have died at least 30 days ago. We, however, are awaiting the autopsy report to confirm the cause of death.”

As no documents were found on the body or near it, police are yet to establish its identity. “The body will be kept at civil hospital for 72 hours. We have informed other police stations and sought details of missing persons so that the man can be identified,” said a cop.

The teams went to the residence of ADG located inside Marvel Homes on Ferozepur Road.

LUDHIANA: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday arrested a senior Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer — who is the additional director general (ADG) of the zonal unit of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Ludhiana — in a Rs 3-crore bribery case.

Prior to ADG Chandar Shekhar’s arrest, CBI nabbed two businessmen — Rajesh Dhanda of Ludhiana and Anup Joshi of Delhi — on Tuesday afternoon from a five-star hotel in Delhi with Rs 25-lakh cash, which they had allegedly accepted on behalf of the DRI officer. Dhanda is a prominent name in the city’s textile circle and has a huge business interest in Dubai, while Joshi is a customs clearing agent.

A statement issued by the CBI said, “The CBI arrested a DRI, Ludhiana, ADG and two private persons, including a friend of the public servant, in an alleged bribery case of Rs 25 lakh. A case was registered against the accused on a complaint, in which it was alleged that in June 2019, Ludhiana DRI had conducted a search at a private clearing agency, which provides services to various exporters. In this search, some documents pertaining to an exporter were also seized. The complainant, a resident of Delhi, submitted a complaint to the CBI that a clearing house agent and a close friend of the Ludhiana ADG demanded Rs 3 crore on behalf of the public servant for ensuring that he would not be implicated by DRI regarding recovery of his documents. CBI caught both private persons while demanding and accepting Rs 25 lakh from the complainant. During investigation, the public servant was also arrested. Searches are being conducted on the premises, including residence and offices of the accused located at Delhi, Noida and Ludhiana. The accused will be produced before the competent court. Further investigation is continuing.”

A clearing agency gets import and export shipments cleared from different departments.

It was only in the afternoon that the agency sources confirmed the arrest of the ADG, as earlier the CBI officials were maintaining that he was under detention. On Wednesday morning, different teams of the CBI visited Ludhiana along with the arrested officer and reached the office of DRI in Ghumar Mandi. Later, they went to the residence of the ADG at Marvel Homes on Ferozepur Road.

The ADG is among the most powerful postings as he has jurisdiction over Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh. ADG Chander Shekhar has had an illustrious career and was involved in big anti-narcotics operations. In November last, he grabbed national limelight when in two separate operations in Kashmir Valley, the DRI, in a joint operation with Army and other agencies, had seized heroin worth Rs 120 crore along with a huge cache of arms and ammunition from the border fence.

Former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and his wife Bhuvaneswari at Yerrabalem village in Guntur district o... Read More

AMARAVATI: TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu and his wife Bhuvaneswari participated in a farmer’s protest in the Amaravati region on Wednesday.

Naidu said chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy had turned a conspirator against the state and was working against its development.

He accused the chief minister of ruining the people’s dreams of a world-class capital city for Andhra Pradesh .

Naidu chose to forsake New Year celebrations and extend solidarity to ongoing protests in the region. Addressing a meeting in Krishnayapalem village, he said Jagan was acting against the farmers who had given up their lands for the capital city.

“Jagan does not know anything about governance and is acting against the interests of the state,” rued the former CM.

Claiming that all works in the capital city region had stopped soon after Jagan assumed the post of chief minister, Naidu said the three capital cities proposal was made as Jagan was unable to transform Amaravati into a capital. Naidu added that Jagan should tell the public what he had constructed in the seven months after becoming chief minister instead of questioning the former TDP government.

Naidu explained that his dreams for Amaravati had centred on the city and AP becoming one of the economic hubs of the country but Jagan had driven the farmers of the region to seek permission for mercy killings from the Prime Minister, a mark of the gravity of the situation.

“YS Rajasekhara Reddy at least tried to respect the opposition and take its advice. Jagan does not have respect for the opposition of concern for peoples’ issues,” said Naidu, adding that the chief minister was unable to prove charges of insider trading against him and his party functionaries.

Naidu found fault with the YSRC-led government for attempting to tarnish the image of Amaravati. “First, they branded it a flood-prone area, later they claimed the soil in the region was unsuitable for constructions, and then there were charges of insider trading. They have lied to the people on all occasions,” claimed Naidu.

VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh finished among the ‘ frontrunner ’ states with a creditable third position in the latest United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals ( SDG 2019) report by Niti Aayog.The state stood no.1 in some of the indicators which include health insurance coverage, clean water and sanitation. Telangana stands at fifth place.Overall, Andhra Pradesh scored 67 out of 100 points which marginally qualifies it as a frontrunning state among all 28 states.AP’s SDG score comparatively stands higher than the national average of 60. The state also improved on its overall score by three points compared to 2018 when it was 64 qualifying it as just a ‘performer’.On the other hand, Telangana scored well in economic growth and decent work while ranking poorly in gender equality. Interestingly, despite being a combined state once, there are certain contrast ratings between both the states as AP still lacks a concrete capital city. Some of the aspects Telangana scored over AP includes: wards with 100% door-to-door waste collection; births registered; and population covered under Aadhaar and households electrified.Of the 16 SDG indicators, AP is graded as a ‘frontrunner’ state in 11 indicators, two categories as ‘performer’ and three cases as ‘aspirant’ which is the lowest grade. AP also stands second place in terms of climate action, life below water — marine ecosystems (compared to nine coastal states in India), after Karnataka . AP stands third in terms of ‘no poverty’ with a score of 69 points.Each indicator has some sub-indicators in which there are contrasting ratings given by the SDG report. Some of the major improvements that the state witnessed under these sub-indicators include: internet subscribers, mobile tele density, habitations connected by all-weather roads under PMGSY, houses completed under PMAY, wards with 100% door-to-door waste collection, waste processed, sex ratio at birth and districts verified to be ODF.In terms of the sub-indicators, AP’s highest score of 96 comes with clean water and sanitation. The second indicator in which AP scored well is affordable clean energy and peace, justice and strong institutions. Conversely, AP stands amongst the worst in ‘zero hunger’ criteria despite standing second in agriculture productivity as food wastage is cited as a ‘major concern' in the report.",amaravati,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064586,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-385004,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ap-ranks-top-in-health-insurance-clean-water-sanitation-sdg-2019/articleshow/73064602.cms

Times News Network

Ludhiana: The police on Tuesday booked 13 immigration agents for defrauding city residents.

Shamsher Singh, a resident of Islam Gunj, said in his police complaint, “Vatan Arora of Alwar, Rajasthan, took Rs 50,000 from me on the promise of sending my son to Singapore on work permit.” When Vatan could not arrange the permit, Shamsher sought a refund, but the former refused.

Division 2 police station sub-inspector Sukhwinder Singh said, “Shamsher lodged a complaint in October 2019. The case was registered on Tuesday after a thorough investigation.”

In another case, Sadar police have booked travel agent Narinder Singh of Daad village for duping members of a Gatka (traditional Sikh martial arts) group on the pretext of sending them abroad.

Surjit Singh, a resident of Hambran and member of the group, said in his complaint, “Narinder took Rs 45 lakh from us, saying he will help us go abroad. When he could not arrange our visas, we asked him to refund the money. But of Rs 45 lakh, he returned only Rs 13 lakh.” The complaint was filed in May 2019.

In the third case, Daba police have registered a case against fraud agents Prince Shrivastava, Sushil Kumar, both residents of Nakodar Road, Jalandhar; Rajpreet Kaur, Mandeep Singh and Priya, all three of Amritsar, on the complaint of Bharmeet Singh, a resident of Maha Singh Nagar.

Bharmeet said, “The accused took Rs 5.30 lakh from me for sending me to Cyprus. But instead they sent me to Turkey on an entry visa.”

Focal Point police, too, have registered a case against fraud travel agents on the complaint of Prabhjot Singh of Jeevan Nagar.

Prabhjot told cops, “Shankar and Rajbir of Gobind Nagar, Ludhiana, took Rs 4.40 lakh from my two relatives — Lakhwinder Singh and Avtar Singh — and me for sending us to Armenia on work permit. After we reached Armenia, the accused also took 4500 dollars from us, but failed to arrange jobs for us. And so, we had to return from there.”

In fifth such case, Jamalpur police have booked Raminderdeep Singh of Amritsar for cheating Karamjit Singh of Bhukhri Kalan of Rs 75,000 on the pretext of sending him to Kuwait on a work visa. “Instead of sending me to Kuwait, Raminderdeep sent me to Dubai on a tourist visa,” alleged Karamjit.

Division 5 police have registered cases against three fraud travel agents. “Rupinder Garcha of Gobindpur village has been booked for duping Yogesh Sharma of Kailash Nagar of Rs 1 lakh on the pretext of sending him to Canada. In another case, we have filed an FIR against Jaswinder Singh of RS Nagar for duping Sangrur’s Hardeep Kaur of Rs 1 lakh. He had taken the amount to send her husband and daughter to Canada. And in the third case, we have booked Gurwinder Singh of Feroze Gandhi Market for cheating Anil Kumar of Bhamiyan Road of Rs 1.30 lakh on the promise of sending him to Germany. Gurwinder had also given Anil a fake job offer letter from Germany,” said a cop.

211,['2/01/2020'],Plastic ban put on hold after firms say will recycle waste,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Panaji: The state environment ministry had decided to impose a complete ban on use of all plastics below 50 micron from January 2020. The state also wanted to ban all items sold in small quantities in plastic and non-recyclable multi-layered packaging like chips packets, satchets, PET bottles below 500ml, etc. Rules were also framed to impose such a ban. However, the state has decided to keep the ban on hold for now.

Environment minister Nilesh Cabral said the plan was changed as manufacturers of such materials have now promised to themselves treat the non-recyclable waste caused from their products.

“The different associations of such packaging manufacturers as well some individual companies like Godrej, Hindustan Unilever, P&G and Tetra among others approached us. We do not want to only impose a ban on plastic, but find a solution,” Cabral told TOI on Wednesday.

“The associations and companies said they want to come on board to collect all types of plastic waste which is even non-recyclable. We had a meeting with them accordingly on December 20. They have said they will tell us how they plan to collect this waste. Therefore, rules for plastic ban have been put on hold for now,” he said.

The December 20 meeting was attended by over 30 associations and representatives of companies manufacturing plastic and multi-layered packaging, he said.

Currently, all such non-recyclable packaging is baled and sent to cement factories where it is used as fuel at very high temperatures. Goa does not have such factories and therefore is dependant on other states.

Cabral said that the manufacturers of the packaging material have been told to involve the unorganised sector like ragpickers in collection of the non-recyclable plastic waste.

“Currently, waste like PET bottles are bought from ragpickers at Rs 8 per piece for recycling and depending on the bottle size the amount paid can go upto Rs 20 a piece. The manufacturers will now ascertain a value to all other types of plastic wastes and involve ragpickers in collection of these too,” the environment minister said.

Earlier, to frame the rules for implementation of a plastic ban, Cabral had involved officials from various departments like directorate of panchayats, municipal administration, Goa state pollution control board and the department of science and technology.

The minister had said that instead of targeting every company that sells products in plastic packaging, the government is looking to target companies which manufacture packaging and distribute it to different companies like Tetra.

NEW DELHI: The aviation regulator’s recent clampdown on unsafe flying practices seems to be paying off. December 2019 was the first month since October 2016 when not a single instance of SOP violation by an Indian carrier pilot requiring action was reported.“There was no incident or accident last month that required action to be taken against pilot. This was a first in 37 months despite the fleet size of Indian carriers increasing significantly in that time frame,” Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) chief Arun Kumar said.The number of incidents requiring action against pilots had peaked mid-2019 due to a sharp rise in cases of runway incursions and aircraft skidding off runways during monsoon. The regulator then audited airlines which saw maximum number of these incidents and ordered action against many carriers’ operational heads and pilots involved in these cases.Data shows that February to August saw up to 11 cases every month, peaking in July. Violations included not following air traffic control instructions; runway incursions, heavy landing causing damage to aircraft; any procedural violation and non-adherence of SOPs. Following the DGCA cracking the whip after the aviation ministry gave it a free hand to rein in on violators, September, October and November saw two cases requiring action against pilots each month and then the figure dropped to zero in December.Maximum number of incidents requiring action against pilots was reported by SpiceJet . On their part, senior pilots say some airlines had a questionable operational record due to their practices. “The way rostering is being done by certain airlines is leaving pilots very fatigued and a tired pilot can inadvertently make mistakes leading to incidents,” said a pilot.They say fuelling practices of some airlines and maintenance issues need to be probed.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063010,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1791803,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/first-in-37-months-no-air-safety-violations-in-december-dgca/articleshow/73063008.cms

Visakhapatnam: Determined to crack down on the tipsy motorists on the New Year ’s Eve, Vizag traffic police booked cases against 287 motorists for driving while under the influence of liquor on the intervening night of December 31, 2019 and January 1, 2020.

The number of drunk driving cases increased by over 21 per cent on New Year’s Eve when compared to the drunk driving cases at last (2019) New Year’s Eve, when 236 motorists were booked for tipsy driving.

Speaking to TOI, assistant commissioner of police (traffic), MRK Raju said that around 180 drunken driving cases were reported under Zone-I of Vizag Police Commissionerate and 107 tipsy driving cases were reported under Zone-II, he added.

“We have appealed to the Vizagites to not to mix a drink in a drive, and also warned them of strict action if they were caught for tipsy driving. Our appeal seem to have little impact, with the number of motorists caught on the New Year’s Eve slightly increased when compared to previous year, said ADCP (Traffic) M Ramesh Kumar.

However, the strict enforcement of the city traffic police has led to fewer incidents of road accidents on New Year’s Eve. Police said that very few non-fatal accidents and one fatal accident was reported during the intervening night of December 31 and January 1, in which only one person died.

A senior police officer on condition of anonymity said, “We saw that some young revellers opted to be safe and hired cabs, auto-rickshaws, and also the bikes of Ola, Rapido and few others after consuming liquor at New Year parties.”

City police chief RK Meena said, “We didn’t let the tipsy motorists get away easy as our teams with advanced breath analysers changed the location of checkpoints from 9 pm on December 31 to 4 am on January 1.

Sources said that police seized 10 cars, 20 auto-rickshaws and over 250 bikes from tipsy motorists. Majority of the motorists who were caught were youngsters.

Temperatures dipping and the New Year celebrations saw liquor sales increasing in the city on December 30 and 31. Vizagites consumed alcohol worth Rs 5 crore in the last three days of 2019.

Sources said that since liquor shops shut down at 8 pm and bars and restaurants downed their shutters at 10 pm, the consumption of liquor was less as compared to last year.

Aurangabad: Police commissioner Chiranjeev Prasad has stopped the increment of two constables and issued notice to a senior police inspector of the Vedantnagar police station after an internal inquiry report found them guilty of helping a man recover the money he had lost to a gambler.

“After carrying out an internal probe, two constables were found guilty of misconduct. As a punishment, we have stopped their increment for one year, and have also served a show-cause notice to an inspector,” Prasad told TOI on Wednesday.

The police department was rattled when the two constables were accused of going to a gambling den and assaulting a man before snatching the money he had won in gambling from their friend in the first week of December 2019.

The constables allegedly assaulted the gambler and took back Rs 1.18 lakh, which one of the constable’s friend had lost during gambling. The alleged incident took place in the Kanchanwadi area falling under the limits of Satara area police station.

According to police, the gambling den was being run from a flat. The man who lost money dialled the police constable, who incidentally happened to be at a nearby shopping mall, along with his woman friend. He, along with the woman friend, went to the flat. He was soon joined by two to three more acquaintances, including another police constable.

The group, allegedly led by the constables, assaulted the gambler and took back Rs 1.10 lakh, the lost money, out of which a portion was reportedly transferred on account.

Angered over being snatched of the won money, the alleged gambler approached Satara area police station for lodging a robbery complaint against the constable and others. To counter the complaint, woman accompanying the constable alleged that the gambler tried to outrage her modesty.

According to police sources, the Satara police were considering the pros and cons of registering a cross complaint, including against the police constable, a senior officer from another government department approached them on behalf of the constable to settle things. The cops too realized that registration of offence would only show them in poor light as the gambling den was operating in their jurisdiction.

On learning about it, the city police chief ordered a probe, following which DCP zone-II submitted a default report, indicting the constables, following which punishment was granted to them and show-cause notice served to the senior PI.

Kozhikode: City corporation authorities have commenced shop visits to create awareness among shop owners to garner their support to impose ban on single-use plastic items in the corporation limits.

Health standing committee chairman K V Baburaj along with the health inspectors visited the shops at Oasis compound at SM Street and Palayam vegetable market on Wednesday to detail about the ban which will be imposed strictly by the civic body in its limits from January 15 onwards.

The single-use plastic ban has not been made compulsory in the limits of corporation due to the favourable court order obtained by the traders from high court against imposing penalty till January 15.

The corporation authorities have formed squads at the 18 health circles and three zonal offices of Cheruvannur-Nallalam, Beypore and Elathur and they will inspect shops to create awareness till January 15 and encourage the traders to switch over to eco-friendly cloth and paper carry bags. The same squad will conduct inspections covering shops and commercial establishments to check violations of ban after January 15.

Only a few shops selling essential commodities, grocery items and fish vendors have started using degradable carry bags and newspapers to wrap the commodities and fish varieties.

Corporation secretary issued an order to schools informing them of the fine fixed to be levied on them on detection of using single-use plastic items to serve food items to students at the time of holding functions at the schools. The health inspectors will impose fine of Rs 10,000 in the initial phase. The fine will be increased to Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 in case the officials detects the violations for the second and third time at the same schools.

The civic body has set up more than 100 kudumbashree cloth bag manufacturing units to supply the bulk orders of cloth carry bags in various sizes to shops, malls, markets to meet the demands of customers. It has also set up units to provide steel plates, glass and cutlery items on rental basis to serve food at the time of holding public and private functions to curb the use of disposable plates and glasses.

K Devaraj, owner of Kurungody store selling grocery items at West Hill said that it’s difficult to comply with the ban due to the absence of viable alternatives to the plastic carry bags. “We are using newspapers to wrap the grocery items. Some of the customers have started bringing cloth bags along with them,” he said.

217,['2/01/2020'],Road near Visakha Valley School to be widened,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority launched the construction works of the master plan road passing through Visakha Valley School , on Wednesday. VMRDA chairperson Dronamraju Srinivasa Rao and metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao launched the works.

Speaking on the occasion, Srinivasa Rao said that chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy laid a foundation stone for the master plan road works on December 28 and they would invite the CM againafter completing the works.

The project would affect a part of the wall and classrooms of the Visakha Valley School, Food Crafts Institute, Kuchipudi Kalakshetram and others. The VMRDA would build the damaged structures for these institutions at the cost of Rs 2.41 crore apart from spending Rs 5.93 crore on the road works. The 1.6-km road connects the national highway and the Vizag-Bheemili road. The VMRDA identified a land pocket near Gudilova to compensate the forest land needed for the road project.

The existing 20-feet road would be expanded to 60 feet. With ever-increasing traffic on both sides of this stretch—which connects national highway and beach road—the narrow road had turned into a traffic gridlock. The traffic from Visakha Valley School also contributes to a good part of traffic on this road. The Visakha Valley School Parents’ Association has long been demanding the government complete the road-widening project considering their daily travails on this stretch, which allows only one four-wheeler at a time.

Malappuram: L&T Infrastructure, the agency which was appointed to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the proposed suspension bridge project across Bharathappuzha in Ponnani has started soil investigation for the construction of the 4.8km bridge.

The soil investigation process is aiming to assess the material for the construction works and feasibility of the project in the proposed location.

L&T has already prepared primary-level design of the multi-crore project and it has started the process of analyzing the traffic through Kozhikode-Ernakulam highway including a number of heavy vehicles through the route, to prepare the DPR.

Office of assembly speaker P Sreeramakrishnan, who is local MLA has informed that the DPR would be submitted soon after completing the soil investigation process to finalize the location of the bridge.

As per the proposed design, the bridge will start from MES College premises and it will end at a location 800m away from Padinjarekkara. The suspension area of the bridge is 400m. Among the four lanes of the bridge, two lines would be used for vehicle traffic and other two lanes would be used as cycle tracks and viewpoints. Entertainment parks also would be set up on the banks of river in Padinjarekkara and Ponnani. A bridge café would also be set up.

Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) has sanctioned Rs 236 crore for the project which would be a part of the proposed coastal highway connecting Thiruvananthapuram with Kasaragod. The bridge would be first of its kind in the state and it would be modelled after the Howrah suspension bridge in Kolkata. The four-lanes would be completely used for vehicle traffic when the coastal highway develops into four lanes.

The total estimated cost of the project, which is to come up across the river at the estuary where Bharathappuzha and Ponnani river converge with Arabian sea, is Rs 236 crore. The project is being jointly implemented by harbour, fisheries, PWD and national highway departments.

Government is planning to appoint E Sreedharan, as chief coordinator of the project. TNN

222,['2/01/2020'],Vizagites call for massive public events to be moved away from the beach,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Citizens and environmentally conscious netizens are taking to social media to protest against the conducting of Visakha Utsav and such fests on the Beach and the adjacent Beach Road. They have appealed to the city administration to not conduct every event on the beach and make sure some events are conducted at venues in others parts of Vizag too.

Apart from severely inconveniencing the residents in these areas and crippling traffic movement, such fests are also adding a lot of trash to the seas and beach, a resident said.

Environmentalist and long-time resident of Pandurangapuram, Sohan Hatangadi said, “Visakha Utsav is conducted at a huge expenditure. It is more of a political propaganda with little impact on inbound tourism. Why can’t we have Vizag Utsav in places like Pendurthi, Anandapuram, Gajuwaka or Malkapuram? It was shameful to see that all the food stalls set up during the utsav left the leftover food and plastic cutlery strewn across the beach and didn’t take any responsibility of cleaning it.”

“Ecologically-sensitive sites like the sea get ravaged during such events. Tonnes of plastic and garbage end up in the sea and on the beaches. Marine life including fish and turtle are impacted. It blocks traffic on all approach roads, even obstructs ambulances. Residents have to put up with constant honking and high exhaust emission levels,” Hatangadi added.

Retired vice chancellor of Nagarjuna University prof V Balamohandas said, “During the Visakha Utsav, it took me around half an hour by car to reach Vuda Children’s Arena from Circuit House, (a distance of less than 500 metres) because the police stopped the traffic to enable convoys of ministers to reach the beach. The government should pass a GO stating that the police should not obstruct the traffic for ministers.”

A top bureaucrat, with several years of experience of working in Vizag, also remarked that planning and better traffic management needs a lot of improvement for the city to be able to host such fests and events.

Citizens like Pratap Singh Tomer pointed out that such fests can be held at multiple locations so that all Vizagites and tourists from elsewhere can visit without having to go through the traffic nightmare. Trade and business all over the city can benefit.

In fact, according to reliable sources, a commander from the Indian Navy had advised the traffic department regarding managing the traffic. The naval officer had suggested parking be done the way the Eastern Naval Command (ENC) does during Navy Day. But his advice was ignored.

Aurangabad: In a time where schools have adequate facilities with proper buildings, Mumsajinagar village of Sengaon tehsil in Hingoli district has a zilla parishad school which is a shack made up of dry grass.

This school is the only school in the vicinity of the village which has a predominant tribal population of 350. The other school are relatively well-built which is in Ghordari village, about 4km from the Mumsajinagar.

Most of the essential facilities, including toilets, are not available in the school. Thus, forcing the children to urinate and excrete in open.

Residents question on how the students can be taught about ‘Swachta Abhiyan’.

The residents are upset as despite donating 5,000 square feet land from the agricultural land they received from the government, for the construction of the school, the education department gas failed to do the needful.

An education department official said they require at least 15,000 square feet of land for construction of a school.

This primary school, which was started a few years back, currently has a strength of 17 students studying in Classes I to V with two teachers including a headmaster (HM), who teaches all the subjects.

Gajanan Khillare teaches all subjects to the students of Class III, IV and V, while the HM teaches students of Class I and II.

To make matters worse, the shack has only one blackboard.

The students get confused between their and classes of other students. The teachers, with the help of the residents, have arranged for tin shade where students of Class III, IV and V students will be shifted.

Sanjay Chillarge, a resident, told TOI, “It is very difficult for the children to walk 8km daily, to and from the school in Ghordari village, so we are forced to send our children to this school.”

The residents said that the administration just granted permission for the school and deployed two teachers, while they had to prepare the shack with dry grass and sticks. “We have crowd funded and arranged some bench and tables for the students,” said Ashok Fupate, another resident.

When contacted, ZP CEO HP Tummod said, “The land in the village is owned by the people of the scheduled tribe and as per the laid down norms, there are limitations in acquiring their land. The other lands in and around the village belongs to the forest department, which can neither be acquired for school nor is it feasible to have school on forest land.”

The official assured to send a team from the education department to the village to check for land for the construction of a school.

Representative image

VISAKHAPATNAM: To provide relief from onion woes, the government has decided to supply subsidised onions at Rs 15 from January 4 or January 5.

The district administration is expecting stock from Krishnapuram (KP) onions in next couple of days.

It can be recalled that the district administration had stopped the subsidised onions for the past few days due to lack of stock. Generally, the port city needs around 35 metric tonnes of onions per day, but around 25 metric tonnes of material was expected every day.

The price of onions at the rythu bazaars is between Rs 75 and Rs 77. Onions continue to cost as much as Rs 100 in the general markets. Damaged crop due to heavy rains and floods as well as a shortfall of rain in some areas caused the scarcity of onions across the country.

Generally, Vizag gets onions from Kurnool and Karnataka. Since rains damaged the crop in Karnataka , the city is now dependant on Sholapur, Kurnool, KP onions and others.

The state government supplied subsidised onions for Rs 25, initially. But the price of the Krishnapuram (Maidukuru) onions decided as Rs 50 a kilo after subsidy. When people opposed the decision, the price was reduced to Rs 25. The government even brought loads from foreign countries to cater to the needs of the public.

Marketing department officials said that KP onions may reach the city by January 4 and they would available in all rythu bazaars. Not just KP onions, the bazaars would also stock onions from countries like Egypt and Turkey .

A senior official in the marketing department said that they would supply 1kg onions for a family.

Kannur: In an effort to improve the tourism sector of Kasaragod, and also to attract the bird and nature enthusiasts to the district, the authorities are planning to set up a bird sanctuary at Kidoor in Kumbala panchayat, as part of the Kasaragod development package.

The place, which is home to over 174 varieties of birds , will be developed by providing the facilities like walkway along the river bank, planting of fruit trees, seating arrangements along with tree guards, solar lamps, toilets and waste treatment facilities, said the authorities. Facilities for bird watching camps would also be put in place.

The Prabhakaran Commission Report, as part of Kasaragod development package, had recommended the development of rural development project in Kumbala, and the bird sanctuary is part of that, said district panchayat president AGC Basheer.

The village, believed to be the root of Padmanabhaswamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram, has many interesting places around and this is one of the natural habitats of a variety of birds, including migratory birds, according to him. Kumbala panchayat has already given the land for the development of the infrastructure and the development would be made in an eco-friendly manner.

Once this bird sanctuary becomes a reality, it would become the biggest bird sanctuary in the district, said the district panchayat president, who also represents Kumbala division.

“When this project is implemented, we expect more nature enthusiasts to reach here and it would boost the eco-tourism,” said Basheer, who added that the Rs 2.7-crore project has gotten the administrative sanction and the work would start soon.

The village, through which the Shiriya River flows, has many varieties of birds, mainly thanks to the ecosystem there. The surveys conducted with the support of ornithologists have identified over 174 varieties of birds, which also include 38 types of migratory birds. Around 160 bird varieties from here have been registered in ‘EBirds’, the online database of bird observations said an official release.

In order to promote bird watching, around eight bird watching camps are organized here every year, with the support of Kumbala panchayat, and the development of the bird sanctuary is expected to boost such activities further.

The plan is to complete the works this year and the works would be awarded soon, said the authorities.

Aurangabad: A young male collared tiger from Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary lived in the area around the world-famous Ajanta Caves and stayed for about eight days before heading towards the Dnyanganga sanctuary in Buldhana district.

The collared tiger C1, moved within a two-km radius of the world heritage site in the Fardapur and Soyegaon areas around Ajanta caves. An alert about its presence was sent to the forest department in Aurangabad by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII). WII, in collaboration with the forest department, has taken up long-term monitoring studies of tigers and in March 2019 had installed radio collars on a couple of them.

Citing information received from WII, forest department officials said the tiger entered the area sometime after December 15 and stayed till December 25, before starting its journey towards Dnyanganga sanctuary on December 26. Deputy forest conservator Satish Wadkar confirmed that the tiger was within a two-km radius of Ajanta caves and Fardapur between mid-December and December 25.

Authorities say they kept the news of C1’s movements under wraps to ensure that no panic-like situation arose since the world heritage monument is visited by many domestic and foreign tourists every day. They also wanted to ensure the wild cat’s safety and security.

Forest officials were relieved to see the three-year-old tiger leave the area without incident. “The tiger preyed only on wild animals in the jungle patches and did not head towards human settlements and farms during his stay here. Any man-animal conflict around the world heritage site would have attracted negative publicity for the wild cat, which we seriously do not want,” said a forest official.

“To ensure that it is not bothered or disturbed, we had decided to keep the development under wraps,” said a senior forest official, who was part of the team that camped in Ajanta at night. As a precautionary measure, teams of the forest department, armed with guns loaded with tranquilizers, were deployed in and around Ajanta and Fardapur jungle to respond to any reports of man-animal conflict.

Forest officials said the tiger originally belongs to Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary in Pandharkawda of Yavatmal district and since leaving it on June 23, 2019, has travelled well over 1,700 km. From October 19 to 30, C1 was in the Umarkhed forest range under Pusad division of Yavatmal. On October 30, it was captured on camera in the Isapur sanctuary (Nanded-Yavatmal border). It also entered Hingoli division of Marathwada and has briefly forayed into Adilabad district of Telangana.

230,['2/01/2020'],Hike in rail fare &amp; LPG price will hurt slump-hit people: Opposition,"This story is from January 2, 2020

NEW DELHI: The opposition led by Congress slammed the BJP government for the hike in rail fares and prices of LPG cylinders and said the decision would further hurt the common man already reeling under the effects of a slowing economy and rising food prices.

Cornering the Modi government on rising unemployment and food inflation, Congress said it had hoped that the government would give some reprieve to the people. However, the two announcements regarding the increase in rail fares and LPG cylinder prices only pushes the common man into a “deeper financial economic crisis”, Congress said.

Asking when the government’s wilfully imposed “travesty” will end, Congress spokesperson Sushmita Dev attacked the government for hiking railway fares. “Coupled with the state of the economy, the rise in unemployment, and the fall in rural consumption, where even ‘daal’ and normal cooking oil is unaffordable, how is the common man going to deal with this injustice,” she said.

Referring to the rise in prices as a cruel New Year gift to the people of India, the Left parties also slammed the government for attacking people’s livelihoods. “Modi government starts the year. After railway passenger fare hikes, another attack on peoples' livelihoods. All this in the wake of sharp job losses, food price inflation and record fall in rural wages,” CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said on Twitter tagging an article on the increase in LPG prices.

In another tweet, Yechury called the rail fare hike, “New year gift from the Modi government.” The government on January 31, raised train fares by one paise to four paise per kilometre, depending on the travel class . It also hiked LPG cylinder rates by 19 per cylinder.

CPI, however, went a step further and demanded a rollback in the increase, alleging that this was a bid by the government to give a leg up to the privatisation of railway operations. “National Secretariat of CPI expresses its strong opposition to the hike in railway fare just before the budget presentation. This is an unhealthy practice to delink budget from price rise.

The National Secretariat is of the option that this step is being taken to help new private train operators who are being brought by the government to operate trains on private basis,” the CPI said in a statement.

231,['2/01/2020'],Cops to lay emphasis on streamlining traffic in 2020,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Nashik: The city police have chalked out plans for the New Year starting with laying more emphasis on improving vehicular traffic situation.

Senior police officials said that a plan in this regard is ready and will be executed in 2020 so that there are no traffic snarls and accidents in the city, especially busy roads and junctions.

Commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare-Patil said, “Our aim is to ensure that people make more use of public transportation. If more and more people use public transport, the rush of private vehicles on city roads will automatically come down, resulting in lesser traffic snarls and accidents.”

Nangare-Patil said that the traffic police have already swung into action against illegal rickshaws plying on city roads. “Once detained, these rickshaws will not operate in future. We have already eliminated the menace of passengers sitting on front seats in rickshaws and are appealing to the rickshaw drivers to ply by meter or share-seat system only,” he said.

“The result of the continuous drives against motorists driving without a helmet or seat-belts is quite evident. Most two-wheeler drivers are now seen riding riding with a helmet. The next step is to identify spots with maximum traffic congestions and road accidents and address them,” Nangare-Patil said.

Senior police officials said that they recently conducted a meeting with the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) officials to take steps for solving the perennial problem of traffic snarl at the Dwarka junction.

DCP Pournima Chougule said that a decision in this regard has been taken. The plan involves shifting of the existing bus stand and auto-rickshaw stands at Dwarka junction to a different place.

“All the rickshaw stands are located on the corners of Dwarka junction, thus creating impediment in smooth flow of traffic. Thus, it has been decided to relocate these rickshaw stands as well as bus stands to a different spot,” Chougule said.

She said that the police are also taking steps to ensure that heavy vehicles do not pass by the Dwarka junction during peak hours.

Over the last one year, police undertook various drives for the use of helmet and seat belts among motorists. Further, taking front seats or four seats in auto-rickshaws has also come down significantly.

CP Nangare-Patil said that in 2020, the aim would be to prepare such a situation so that more and more people make use of mass transport system.

Nashik city would get a fleet of 400 buses as against the existing 160 city buses from April 2020.The 400 buses would start plying on the city roads in a phased manner.

Aurangabad: Empowering women, bridging the gap between people and the police and basic policing will be the priorities for the Aurangabad rural superintendent of police, Mokshada Patil, in 2020.

The SP has roped in career counsellors and woman psychiatrist — to help the victims of domestic violence and women struggling in their personal lives — for the women’s complaint redressal centre.

In addition to this, a list of villages, under A-grade are being identified, so that police teams visit during weekly markets and interacts with the residents.

SP Patil has also issued an internal communication announcing that the rural police would pay for the higher education of cops’, who did not complete their education after joining the police force.

For getting recruited as constable, the candidates need to be at least HSC pass. Majority of the candidates after getting recruited, do not complete their education. In order to motivate them, the initiative has been taken. “On completion of graduation and with a certain number of years of service, police constables have an opportunity to appear for departmental examinations and become officers,” said SP Patil.

Apart from this, Damini squads have been assigned to reach out to female students travelling in public transport by sharing helpline numbers.

A special squad of tourism police will be trained in basic etiquettes, communication skills before they are deployed at the tourist spot for the safety of the tourists.

233,['2/01/2020'],Sena beats BJP to bag 5 of 9 panchayat samiti posts,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Aurangabad: The Shiv Sena in alliance with NCP-Congress on Tuesday defeated BJP by winning five of the nine panchayat samiti elections in the district.

BJP had to remain content with two panchayat samitis, while Congress won one post. An independent won the seat in Kannad with the help of some BJP members.

He also claimed that the independent who won the Kannad panchayat samiti belonged to BJP as he got elected with the support of the party. Boralkar also said that the situation arose because all other parties have joined hands against the BJP, but this has not gone down well with the voters. He also admitted that earlier, six panchayat samitis were being led by the BJP in the district.

234,['2/01/2020'],HC quashes FIR against primary teacher,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court recently quashed an FIR registered against a teacher in Latur district who was booked following a complaint by the school’s headmaster for seeking details of income-tax refund.

The assistant teacher, 40-year-old Dhanraj Shivraj Dhumale, then approached the HC challenging the FIR registered with the Chakur police station for offences punishable under sections 294 (obscene act) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. He had also sought quashing of the case and the chargesheet.

Rajendra Kure, the 40-year-old headmaster of Lalbahadur Shastri Secondary School, Shastrinagar, had alleged that on October 15, 2016, at 12.40pm, Dhumale, who was working as a primary teacher, came to his office. Dhumale allegedly used abusive language as well as threatened him (Kure) with dire consequences. The headmaster said the petitioner wanted to ask about an income-tax refund. Kure also contended that when Dhumale went to fetch some weapon, like a wooden plank, other employees of the school somehow held him back and saved Kure. He lodged a complaint on October 23, following which, the crime was registered.

The petitioner, however, submitted that he had given representation to the education department, making a complaint against the management on October 19, 2016, alleging that the management and the headmaster, by name of Bavage, were harassing him and in the incident dated October 15, the other headmaster threatened and abused him when he was seeking information about I-T refund. He had also complained to the education officer that the management collected money in the name of contribution toward building fund as well as annual gathering.

The court noted that the petitioner was also not allowed to resume his duty till the high court ordered the management on March 20, 2019, to allow the teacher to resume duty.

The HC had also noted that the petitioner was not paid salary for months.

While allowing the petition, the division bench comprising Justice T V Nalawade and Justice M G Sewlikar, observed: “It appears that the management chose other ways like giving report to police, which is nothing but pressure tactics.” The bench also stated: “Employees who depend fully on the salary face all kinds of problems when management stops giving salary and does not allow the employees to resume duty. If there are some misconduct, then appropriate steps like inquiry can be taken by the management and action can be taken.”

The court also observed: “In view of these circumstances, this Court holds that it will be abuse of process of law if the petitioner is directed to face the trial for the aforesaid offences. The incident took place inside of the campus of the school. Employees, who are interested in getting salary every month do not want to raise dispute with the management and they support the management.”

235,['2/01/2020'],"Review SLC decision on 50 saw licences, APCCF urges govt","This story is from January 2, 2020

Nagpur: The state-level committee (SLC), which grants licences to saw mills, is in the dock for its decision to permit 42 inches additional horizontal band saw (AHBS) to 50 saw mills as it is facing opposition from within the department now.

APCCF & state nodal officer Sanjeev Gaur on December 19, 2019, had invited attention of PCCF (HoFF) and chairman of SLC, raising serious objection on the minutes of the SLC meeting held on November 18, 2019.

The copy of the letter has been sent to the state government, which has constituted the committee as well as the regional office of the MoEFCC, which happens to be the appellate authority against the decisions of the SLC.

According to Gaur the decision taken by the SLC on November 18 to grant more such licences instead of reviewing the 50 licences issued earlier is nothing but afterthought on the part of the then PCCF (HoFF) to defend his report to issue licenses, which has already been rejected by the government.

On November 18, SLC, under the chairmanship of UK Agrawal, the then PCCF, took a controversial decision to look afresh into matters of applications of additional cutting machines instead of reviewing 50 AHBS issued on July 23, 2018. Gaur also contended that the decision to grant 50 licences on July 23 was without prescribed quorum.

It was Gaur, who as CCF (territorial), Nagpur, and the member of SLC then, played a whistle-blower and pointed out that the SLC decision was against Supreme Court directives. Based on Gaur’s report, the state government has objected to the SLC decision to grant 50 AHBS licences in Kolhapur circle.

Gaur contended that in the nine-member SLC meeting on November 18, barring the chairman himself and representative of the saw mill owners, all others were new.

The regional office of MoEFCC at Nagpur has already informed PCCF (HoFF) to take necessary action in conformity with Supreme Court order of March 4, 1997 regarding licences granted to 50 applicants for operation of 42-inch AHBS on November 15, 2019.

Gaur also mentioned that the decisions in the meeting held on November 18 tantamount to brushing aside facts and statutory provisions of MFR 2014.

Surprisingly, minutes of the meeting held on November 18 do not bear signature of MoEFCC representative Suresh Kumar Adapa, raising doubts whether SLC decision was in conformity with government of India guidelines.

Gaur also urged present PCCF (HoFF) N Rambabu that entire issue may again be placed before the SLC in a fair and impartial manner without any external influence.

Rambabu has already told TOI that he shall be taking appropriate action, both as chairman of SLC and technical adviser to the government. “Now it is up to him to save the government from embarrassment,” said sources.

As reported by TOI, permission for 50 band saws has been granted without receiving timber assessment report from Institute of Wood Science & Technology (IWST), Bengaluru & Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE), Dehradun. Besides, as per state government, giving permission for installation of additional band saws amounts to increasing cutting capacity of a saw mill and is against SC decision.

“A plain reading of the minutes of November 18, 2019, meeting makes it clear that the entire story is hatched and there is an attempt to cover up the actions of then PCCF, who, by his position as chairman of SLC, must have prevailed over other members,” Gaur’s objection letter states.

CCF (protection) and member-secretary of the SLC SS Dahiwale confirmed that APCCF Gaur has raised objections against the minutes of the meeting of SLC held on November 18.

AGRA: A 37-year-old bullion trader allegedly killed himself after shooting his wife and two minor children inside his SUV, parked near Vrindavan exit point on Yamuna Expressway early Wednesday morning. While Neeraj Agarwal, his wife Neha (35) and his daughter Dhanya (6), were found dead, his son Shaurya,10, is battling for life at a Delhi hospital.As per documents accessed by TOI, Agarwal was facing multiple inquiries from Income Tax department, commercial tax department and Economic Offences Wing for Rs 123-crore transactions after demonetisation in November 2016. Police say that the Enforcement Directorate was also on his trail and he was under heavy debt. “These could be likely reasons which pushed him to the brink,” they say.His family, however, claimed that Agarwal was killed at the behest of his business rivals. “Some people had shot at Neeraj two years ago in Govardhan area and a police complaint was filed in this regard. Fortunately, he survived as the bullet nicked just his car,” said his father Dinesh Chandra Agarwal. The family is based in Govindnagar area of Mathura but Neeraj, along with his family, was living in Delhi for the past one year.“Neeraj used to come to Mathura frequently. His wife also hailed from Mathura’s Jaganathpuri area,” his father added. He admitted that some inquiries were going on against him. “But Neeraj had filed an appeal in the cases and this this could not be the reason for his death,” he said.Police said that the incident took place early Wednesday morning. While Neeraj’s body was found on the driver’s seat of Tuscon, all other three members of his family were on the back seat and had gunshot injuries on their head. The car was locked from inside. According to SP (city) AK Meena, Neeraj’s son was found breathing when the police broke the glass of the car and he was immediately rushed to Nayati hospital from where he was shifted to Apollo hospital, Delhi, as his condition was critical.Meena told TOI that a small note was also found inside the car and the it had been sent to forensic wing for checking its authenticity. Though the note was not clear, it had a mention of some issues related to custom and penalties. He said, police found a pistol in Neeraj’s right hand and he had apparently shot himself on his right temple.Neeraj’s brother-in-law, Amit, told TOI that his sister, Neha and her family had dinner with them and they all appeared happy. “They had left late on Tuesday night for Delhi as their daughter’s program was scheduled early Wednesday morning,” he told TOI. Amit has filed a complaint in this matter and an FIR is being lodged at police station.In July 2018, the investigation wing of I-T department had conducted a raid at RS Bullion and Jewellers in Mathura, owned by Neeraj Agarwal and Neha Agarwal, and found large-scale anomalies during the period after demonetisation. According to reports, RS Bullion had alone deposited Rs 123 crore cash in bank accounts during demonetisation.After the raid, the I-T officials had told media persons that Neeraj claimed to have sold gold worth Rs 37 crore in a single day, however, records suggested that his firm converted black money of people into white by taking commission. In return, the trader had provided them receipt of gold purchase. Also, the trader, had claimed that he had taken gold stock from a firm in Mumbai — Vanity Jeweller — but it was closed down in 2012, much before demonetisation announced.",agra,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064010,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-439614,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/delhi-bullion-trader-kills-wife-daughter-before-shooting-self/articleshow/73062134.cms
237,['2/01/2020'],State BJP chief likely from coastal Odisha,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Bhubaneswar: Hectic parleys are on within the BJP as the saffron party looks for a replacement of Basanta Panda as party’s state unit president. Sources said the new state chief will be named within the next few days.

After BJP central observers — Rajya Sabha member Vinay Sahasrabuddhe and national secretary R P Singh —met senior party leaders here on Tuesday and held discussions with them to ensure ‘unanimous’ selection of the new state chief, speculation is rife that the saffron party may be looking for a face in coastal Odisha for the top party position in state.

A BJP insider said considering the party’s remarkable growth in western Odisha in recent years, now it will focus to strengthen its hold in the coastal region. “Selection of the new state chief may be done keeping that in mind,” they said. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the party won all the five Lok Sabha seats (Bargarh, Balangir, Sambalpur, Sundargarh and Kalahandi) in western Odisha besides three others, Bhubaneswar in coastal part besides Mayurbhanj and Balasore in the north.

The state BJP presidents have been from western Odisha since 2004 in a row when Jual Oram took over, followed by Suresh Pujari (2006-2009), Jual Oram again (2009-2012), KV Singhdeo (2012-20016) and then Basanta Panda in 2016. Also, the current leader of opposition (Pradipta Naik) is also from western Odisha. The party may try to do a balancing act by choosing someone from the coastal region, a senior BJP leader said.

Going with such a presumption of ‘coastal factor,’ senior leaders Manmohan Samal (Bhadrak) and Sameer Mohanty (Cuttack) emerge as top contenders. Factors against Samal who was party president twice (1999-2000 and 2001-2004) may be his past controversies. He had to resign as revenue minister from the BJP-BJD coalition government in 2008 over his alleged involvement in a sex scandal. Speculation over the name of Sameer, currently party’s vice-president, was also doing the rounds during party chief’s selection in 2016.

However, given that the election of state BJP leader is just a formality and would be decided by party chief Amit Shah, one never knows which factor would finally work, said BJP sources.

Speculation over the names of former Union minister Jual Oram (who did not find a place in Modi II cabinet), Suresh Pujari (currently national secretary) and KV Singhdeo (who lost the 2019 assembly elections), all of whom have held the post in the past, are also doing the rounds as among the contenders.

“Irrespective of region, the new state chief has to be an acceptable face to all in the party rank and files and someone who inspires public confidence. That’s the most important factor,” said a senior BJP leader.

238,['2/01/2020'],Counters to get back lost articles in autos,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Bhubaneswar: Commissionerate police in association with auto-rickshaw drivers is planning to open lost and found counters in Bhubaneswar where the drivers can keep the lost articles of passengers and inform police. Police sources said the proposed move will be a trust-building exercise by auto-rickshaw drivers.

“We have mooted the idea of opening lost and found counters after coming across some instances where passengers, travelling in auto-rickshaws lost their articles. Last month, a couple from Sagar in Madhya Pradesh lost their bag in an auto-rickshaw. Our team later traced their lost bag and returned it to them,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Sagarika Nath said.

Sagarika said details involving location of the proposed lost and found counters and their functionality would be finalized soon. “We will discuss with auto-rickshaw associations and seek their cooperation. The drivers will be sensitized about honesty and integrity so that they immediately take the help of police to return lost articles of passengers,” she said.

Police are likely to discuss the plan with auto-rickshaw drivers in an awareness camp here on Thursday. The traffic police would sensitise 5,000 auto-rickhshaw drivers on traffic and lane discipline among others on Thursday. “Our focus is to streamline the chaotic movement of auto-rickshaws by some unruly drivers. They will be sensitized about lane discipline, good conduct with passengers and usage of auto-rickshaw bays/stands to avoid traffic congestion,” Sagarika said.

Every day over 30,000 auto-rickshaws ply on different routes in the city. In October last year, police identified auto-rickshaw stands and bays near Raj Mahal Square, Kalpana Square and Vani Vihar Square. Each stand can accommodate at least 40 auto-rickshaws. Only five auto-rickshaws are allowed to be ply at the bay at one time. The bays exclusively work as only pick and drop points, police sources said. However, there were allegations about non-compliance by many drivers of the auto-rickshaws stand facilities.

Police said a private auto-rickshaw association has decided to provide uniform and identity cards to drivers in the city. The association is also planning to develop a mobile application to help passengers book auto-rickshaws.

N Uttam Kumar Reddy

HYDERABAD: Telangana Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy filed a public interest petition in the high court challenging the poll notification and schedule for municipal polls in the state without determining and notifying the reservations for STs, SCs, BCs and women.

He urged the court to set aside the notification issued by the State Election Commission (SEC). He said SEC should have waited till the reservations were decided in respect of 2,727 wards in 120 municipalities and 385 wards in five municipal corporations which would go to polls on January 22. He sought a stay on the further process because allowing the authorities to go ahead would be ‘contrary to the mandate of the Constitution’. SEC had announced that a notification would be issued on January 7, nominations process taken up between January 8 and 10. Poll result will be out on January 25.

HYDERABAD: The population of Scheduled Tribes (STs) is less in urban areas as compared to rural areas in Telangana . So, Backward Classes may get more percentage of reservations in the ensuing municipal polls . The exercise to reserve wards and chairpersons in municipalities and mayors in municipal corporations is almost complete.

Officials said final touches are being given to the quota issue and that the list of reserved wards, chairpersons and mayor posts is likely to be announced on January 4 or 5. BCs enjoyed 23% reservations in the gram panchayat polls.

“The population of SCs and STs in the urban local bodies going to polls is between 17% and 20%. Also, the government is likely to take the state as a unit to finalise reservations. As a result, BCs are likely to get a quota between 30% and 33%,” said an official.

At least three seats of mayor, 30 posts of municipal chairpersons and over 1,300 wards in the urban local bodies would go to BCs if they get over 30% quota. As per the Constitution, reservations for SCs and Scheduled Tribes are given in proportionate to their population which cannot exceed 20% in the ensuing municipal polls, sources said.

Fearing that BC quota may be reduced in the municipal polls, BC welfare associations led by R Krishnaiah submitted a memorandum to state election commissioner V Nagi Reddy to ensure that 34% quota extended to BCs in municipal polls in 2000 should be continued even in the January 22 polls. Krishnaiah told TOI that they would move Supreme Court if BC reservation is reduced in the polls.

(done)

Nashik: The city police’s Nirbhaya squad has taken to task 4,055 men and youths for harassing women, including college and school students, from June 6 last year till December 31, 2019, data available with police shows.

The all-woman squad, comprising four units, swung into action soon after it was formed on June 6 last year and the trouble-makers, mostly youths, were booked under various sections of the Bombay Police Act.

“Those caught by the squad were booked and released with a warning that strict action would be taken against them if they are seen indulging in such activities again,” said a senior officer of the squad on Wednesday.

“The squad is proactive when it comes to spreading awareness among women, especiall female students, and conducted 941 awareness programmes in educational institutions,” said the officer.

Officers said that the squad has been basically formed to provide a safe atmosphere to women and girls, it also challaned 858 motorists for flouting traffic rules during the last seven months.

The officers said that the squad got many distressed calls from women and girls about harassment, following which action was initiated.

An officer said the Nirbhaya squads move around in different parts of the city to check if women or girls are harassed by hooligans near schools, colleges, gardens or at market places and take action against such people.

Given the awareness programmes organised all over the city, most of women and girls studying in schools and colleges have the phone numbers of the squad.

For instance, a college student had left her mobile phone in a rickshaw a couple of months back. When called the number through her friend’s phone, the rickshaw driver demanded Rs 2,000 to return the mobile phone. The student soon contacted the Nirbhaya squad, which caught the driver and booked him.

Only recently, the squad launched a drive in the city and its teams are taking part in sting operations to keep a check on men and youths harassing women at night and nabbed a number of such people.

The women teams of the squad not only conduct awareness programmes for girl students in schools and colleges, but also counsel young girls who are found loitering in gardens after bunking their classes.

HYDERABAD: Excluding North East and Union Territories, Telangana is one of the states where the lowest amount of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) funds were spent in the last three years, according to the data of the past four years released by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, while Andhra Pradesh stood among the states where the highest amount of CSR funds were spent.AP, with a CSR expenditure of Rs 2,731 crore, stood third in the country after Maharashtra and Karnataka, whereas Telangana stood 11th in the country with Rs 918 crore despite several MNCs, corporate companies and IT and pharma firms having presence in Hyderabad.A total of Rs 42,536 crore was spent towards CSR by companies in India. The states that spent the lowest towards CSR were Bihar, Punjab, Jharkhand and Kerala. As per section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, every company during each financial year has to spend atleast 2% of its average net profit made during three immediately preceding financial years. Further, it is the company board’s prerogative to take up CSR activities, whereas the government cannot issue directions to corporates to spend on any activity.In Telangana, in 2017-18, around 634 companies had spent around Rs 291 crore mostly on education, rural development and healthcare. Infosys emerged as the biggest spender with Rs 20 crore, followed by Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) at Rs 19 crore and Divis laboratories at Rs 15 crore. Interestingly, the total amount spent on CSR in Hyderabad was Rs 21 crore.Suresh Chitturi, former president of Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), AP told TOI, “During election year, the CSR expenditure usually falls. It all depends on political will. In AP, from 2014, there was the special interest taken by the government to pursue CSR with corporates, hence expenditure could be more. Also, there are several profit-making PSUs in AP which may have spent CSR funds. Telangana figures are surprising.”Stating that it is difficult for companies to find the right NGOs to fund, he said, “Everyday, several NGOs approach us. We have to check the credibility and fund them. We don’t know how these funds are used. There is greater awareness these days on CSR among firms.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064429,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1484344,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/andhra-among-top-states-in-csr-spending-with-rs-2731cr-t-one-of-the-lowest-spenders-with-rs-918cr/articleshow/73062164.cms

CLEARED SKHER

SLUG: KASARA GHAT

Nashik: The Railways has decided to raise protective canopies at the entrance of the tunnels between Igatpuri and Kasara stations to prevent a recurrence of boulder falls during monsoon.

The Railways will construct six canopies at entrance of the tunnels so that the trains are able to move in and out freely. Of the six to be constructed, the Railways have already completed the construction of one at T3 terminal while coming from Kasara towards Igatpuri.

“There were several instances of boulders falling in the ghat section during the monsoon of 2019 at the entrance of tunnels. Once a major tragedy was avoided due to the alert loco pilots. In order to cut down on the risk and stress on loco pilots and increase safety, it has been decided to raise canopies of iron mesh at the entrance of the tunnel,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer of central railway.

The canopy has been designed in a manner that several iron rods run parallel to each other and can arrest boulders above a particular size from falling on the tracks.

The canopy has been built in a manner that it will catch and divert the boulders falling on it and do not affect the movement of trains. The boulders that fall through the beams will be small and would not hit the rail traffic. The beams have been laid on a strong concrete foundation and are at spots that are likely to witness boulders fall.

The cost of constructing each canopy is around Rs 90 lakh. According to the officials, the work of building the remaining five canopies will be finished before monsoon.

In 2019, heavy rainfall had caused boulders to fall on the tracks in the ghat section on several occasions, but it did not result in any major accident. Alert employees on the trains prevented any accidents. The construction of these canopies, much like the wire mesh on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, is a preventive measure.

The reduction in imports is a result of high gold prices and weakened consumer demand,” said Samir Mankad, CEO, GSEC Limited.The price of gold stood at Rs 40,300 per 10 gram in the Ahmedabad market on Wednesday.“Gold prices have remained high in the international market owing to escalating geopolitical tensions and increased procurement from central banks. Also, the fluctuating rate of Indian currency against the US dollar and increase in basic customs duty on gold kept gold prices on an upward trend most of this year,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).“Gold imports plunged due to various factors. These include stress across most industrial sectors and weakened consumer confidence, which caused a liquidity crisis. All of these factors led to a plunge in demand for most commodities and assets, including gold,” he added.Analysts said that demand for gold remained low-key during the wedding season as well, due to which yellow metal imports were further affected.“High prices of gold was a major deterrent for those looking to buy wedding jewellery. This led to an increase in exchange of old gold against purchase of new jewellery. We hope that after Uttarayan, when the Kamurta period ends, the increase in the number of muhurats will improve the demand,” said Manoj Soni, a city-based jeweller.Jewellers said that gold imports and overall demand has remained muted over the past two months in rural areas due to crop failures triggered by the unseasonal rainfall in October.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-imports-to-state-in-2019-lowest-since-2004/articleshow/73062243.cms

BAREILLY: Conservation effort and awareness among local people about the “vulnerable” sarus crane saw the number of Uttar Pradesh ’s state bird increasing by 254 in just one year in Rohilkhand forest zone comprising nine districts of Bareilly and Moradabad divisions.

The number of sarus crane, which is considered as the tallest flying bird in the world, has gone up from 1,867 in 2018 to 2,121 in 2019. Besides, of the total 2,121 birds found in the Rohilkhand forest zone, 401 are juveniles, according to a survey conducted by the forest department.

The bird is listed in Schedule IV (protected) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 and as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.

Chief conservator of forests, Rohilkhand zone, Lalit Verma told TOI, “The number of birds has gone up by 254 in a year. The increase in the sarus crane count can be attributed to the conservation effort and awareness among locals. We have been educating locals that sarus does not pose any threat to them if it is found present in their backyard, and thus, they should not disturb the bird.”

The survey elucidates that 1,720 adults and 401 juveniles sarus were found in the Rohilkhand forest zone. However, except Bijnor and Rampur, all other districts falling under the forest zone reported an increase in the sarus count in comparison to 2018. No Sarus was, however, found in Rampur which had eight birds in 2017 and four in 2018, while the count of birds in Bijnor decreased from 112 in 2018 to 102 in 2019.

The forest department had conducted a two-day counting for sarus crane on December 16 and 17. For the purpose, forest teams first conducted a survey of places where sarus were sighted the previous years and also reviewed new locations. Besides, the forest department also constituted teams comprising forest staff, NGOs, farmers and locals, who were present at the possible locations for sighting sarus.

According to officials as sarus birds are found near wetlands, marshy areas and paddy fields, teams were deployed at all selected sites to avoid inaccuracies. The counting was carried out from 7am to 9am and 3pm to 5pm on both days.

According to officials, the height of a standing sarus, which usually found in pairs, is approximately 156 cm (5’2”). The crane builds its nest in June-July in marshy areas using paddy straw, leaves and twigs and their breeding period is August-September. A female crane usually lays two eggs at a time.

In an informal chat with mediamen, he said the party leadership has given freedom to local-level leaders to work out winning strategies in the coming municipal elections. He criticised the State Election Commission for giving very little time to select candidates for the January 22 polls.

He lambasted chief minister Kalvakuntla Chandrasekhar Rao for diluting democratic norms.

“Where is the need to arrest Congress leaders who were going to Gandhi Bhavan in a peaceful rally,” he said, referring to police clampdown on the rallyists and detaining them during an anti-CAA protest.

Meanwhile, Uttam’s remarks on change of guard in the TPCC leadership led to a lot of speculations. Sources said MLA D Sridhar Babu and MP A Revanth Reddy were among the frontrunners to succeed Uttam. “With the party set to effect a replacement only after the municipal election results, it will be a testing time for all the aspirants,” a leader said.

Nagpur: As central goods and services tax (GST) department is running Sabka Vishwas amnesty scheme for defaults of the earlier central excise and service tax regime, Nagpur is among three zones where the response has been beyond the estimates. The scheme was extended for 15 days on December 31, 2019.

The scheme covers tax demands of pre-GST regime that have been held up under litigation. The taxpayers can clear their liability by paying the dues ranging up to 60% of the demand. At the time of launch, estimates were made on the basis of number of long-drawn litigations where it was hoped that the taxpayer may go for a settlement.

Till 2019 end, 1.36 lakh applications for an amount of Rs6,99,770 crore were received by the department from all over the country. Over 7,500 applications have been made in Nagpur zone for an amount of Rs339 crore. This comes to 117% of the estimate. The Nagpur zone covers Nashik and Aurangabad commissionerate too.

The average response comes to 73% of the total estimates drawn for all zones. The other two zones where the actuals have exceeded the estimates are Visakhapatnam and Mumbai.

Source said the better performance in the zones like Nagpur has helped in pulling up the national average to 73%.

If the number has exceeded the estimates, it means that even those assessees whom the department thought may prefer to continue with the litigations have turned up and applied under the scheme. Once an application is made, the amount due to the government if freezed.

Chartered accountant Pritam Mahure says, “Sabka Vishwas scheme has been successful as it has liquidated more than 73% of the pending legacy. The number of applications may even go up further due to the 15-day extension. However, many taxpayers are unable to apply due to severe cash crunch on account of slowdown and thus more extension, say by 2 months, could have been better.”

The highest development expenditure was 77% in 2015-16 and the lowest was in 2017-18, when the expenditure was 59%. It is these development expenditures which ensure creation of new civic infrastructure in the city, according to a budget analysis by Pathey Budget Centre, an NGO that analyzes public expenditure.The Pathey analysis claims that the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has never been able to achieve a cent per cent tax collection. the actual revenue collection has only grown from 75% in 2014-15 to 85% in the last budget year. The largest revenue shortfall — worth Rs 1,367 crore — was reported in the 2017-18 budget year. In 2018-19 the AMC has claimed that it collected Rs 4,300 crore against the budget estimates of Rs 5,240 crore. “This is most unlikely as the actual collection will still be less than the revised estimates for 2018-19,” says Mahender Jethmalani, one of the authors of the budget analysis.In 2018-19 the AMC had declared a budget of Rs 8,051 crore, of which it was to spend Rs 4,124 crore on capital works. Of this, Rs 1,747 crore was raised by the AMC itself while the rest was received as grants from the state government.If one were to analyze AMC’s own fund expenditure according to the 2018-19 budget estimates, 16% were reserved for laying new drainage, 11 % were allocated for bridge projects, 9.9% were earmarked for water supply infrastructure, while 9% were directed towards housing. In the same budget year, the AMC was to receive Rs 1,775 crore from the state government of which a mammoth 42.23% was received as grants under the Swarnim Jayanti Mukhya Mantri Shaheri Vikas Yojana (SJMMSVY), 15.25% was provided as grants under the PM Awas Yojana, 14.08% was to be received as a grant under AMRUT — a central government urban renewal scheme. In the last budget year nearly 3.66% of the state government grant was provided for undertaking cleanliness mission under the Swachh Bharat scheme.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amcs-budget-spending-short-of-target/articleshow/73062239.cms
257,['2/01/2020'],Works worth Rs772cr hit as civic chief cuts NMC budget by 25%,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Nagpur: In an unwelcome development at the beginning of the year, municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar has dropped various works pertaining to basic amenities worth over Rs772 crore approved in the current fiscal due to poor tax recovery by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), failure to achieve revenue target and finding new income sources. This confirms that the 156-year-old is going through a severe financial crisis.

The works will be dropped as a result of Bangar’s decision to implement 25% cut in the budget presented by standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane in June last year, which is probably happening only for the second time in NMC’s history. Bangar will present the revised budget in February.

The cut will impact cement road, tar road, water supply, sewage, storm drain, LED street light project and other types of infrastructure works. Leaders of BJP, ruling party in NMC, are likely to create pressure on Bangar to take back the decision.

Pohane had presented a budget of Rs3,197.60 crore and approved works of Rs3,197.34 crore, for a balance of Rs25.49 lakh by March 31. Bangar told TOI that based on data compiled for revenue earned between April and November end, and considering experience of last five years, likely revenue between December and March end was calculated.

Against the target of Rs3,197.60 crore, till November end, the NMC could mop up Rs1,882.87 crore (59%), including 2018-19 fiscal’s balance of Rs399.87 crore. Thus, the actual revenue this fiscal so far is Rs1,483 crore.

The income includes state’s grants of Rs1,102 crore, which means NMC collected revenue of only Rs381 crore on its own from property tax, water bill, town planning etc in the last eight months.

“If 25% cut is not implemented, it will create liability on the NMC. Work orders will be restricted up to 75% under all heads, excluding those works approved under fixed priority, for backward class and persons with disabilities,” he said.

The NMC had approved works worth Rs31.20 crore under fixed priority which are used for internal roads, Rs55.37 crore under backward class for works in slum areas and Rs20 crore for welfare of persons with disabilities, for a total of Rs106.57 crore. Thus, the 25% cut will be on works of Rs3,091.03 crore, which means works worth Rs772.75 crore dropped.

The cut is slightly higher than the budget presented by Bangar in March last year. He had presented a Rs2,452.36 crore budget but Pohane increased it by Rs745.24 crore.

Bangar is following a trend set by his predecessors. Against the practice of presenting revised budget in December after analysing situation up to November end, civic chiefs have been presenting them in February or March, that too with a cut. It was done for the first time in 2010-11 by the then municipal commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal.

The dropped works are either deleted on permanent basis in the revised budget or they create a liability for next fiscal.

Pohane said he would request Bangar to bring down the cut to 15%. “The cut is result of less recovery by NMC officials concerned against whom action will be initiated. Last fiscal, Rs299 crore were received as special funds from the state government to avoid the cut. We will approach the government this time too,” he said.

Condemning the move, Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe said that citizens are being made to suffer due to BJP’s failure. “BJP is either unable to ensure satisfactory recovery and achievement of target or increasing budget by cheating people. We will demand implementation of all works. Civic chief should have sought general body’s approval before taking the decision,” he said.

HYDERABAD: Two more persons were arrested in a new case booked in relation to the multi-crore Insurance Medical Services (IMS) fraud on Wednesday. So far, 23 people were held in the IMS scam.

ACB arrested Omni Medi company proprietor K Srihari Babu and Sweden-based pharma company Hemocue’s regional manager T Venkatesh.

Srihari Babu, former IMS director Ch Devika Rani and joint director Padma played a key role in obtaining purchase orders for Legend Enterprises, whose proprietor is his associate Krupasagar Reddy, officials said. Venkatesh, who is Telangana regional manager of Hemocue, had reportedly issued a fake authorisation letter indicating that Legend Enterprises was the authorised distributor of Hemocue’s products in Telangana.

“Using the fake letter, Devika Rani, Padma in collusion with Srihari and Krupasagar Reddy, issued purchase orders for white blood cell cuvettes and blood glucose cuvettes. The accused placed purchase orders for the products, whose original prices were Rs 11,800 and Rs 1,950 per kit for Rs 36,800 and Rs 6,200, quoting over three times the product’s original price. Legend Enterprises supplied 6,291 units of white blood cell cuvettes and 4,500 units of glucose cuvettes in 2017-18 and charged excess amount of Rs 12,84,96,600.

Nagpur: It was a wet start to 2020.

New Year revellers, who were wrapped in winter clothes on Tuesday, were caught on the wrong foot and with the inappropriate wear as it started raining around midnight. Most didn’t heed the forecast of the Met department which had hit the bull’s eye with its prediction.

Said Sajeena Abraham, “We had just stepped out of the church after the midnight mass and had to take shelter from the rain. It was pelting like it was monsoon. We had planned a little party which got delayed taking the punch out of our revelry.”

According to the data of Regional Meteorological Centre, Nagpur, the city received a total rainfall of 8.3 millimetres. Following showers, the minimum temperature of Nagpur almost rose by double — from 6.5 degrees Celsius it saw a drastic increase of 13.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday. The maximum temperature recorded was 21.8 degrees Celsius.

Many places in the city were flooded. Motorists, especially two-wheel drivers, had to wage through water making driving a difficult job.

“We had planned a terrace party with family friends in my house,” said residents of Friends Colony. “After it started drizzling we thought it could just be a passing shower. But when the intensity increased, we had no option but to shift indoors.”

As per RMC, the highest rainfall was recorded at Bhandara (28.6mm). The met department has forecast thunderstorm or hailstorm accompanied with lighting for Thursday too. For the coming week, the minimum temperatures of the city are expected to sway between 6-12 degrees Celsius.

As reported by TOI, the region is experiencing unusual rains in winter season as the wind flow is not completely northerly. On December 26, Nagpur received 10mm rains. Due to the unseasonal rains, the city has been witnessing less cold and more humidity.

A compiled data for December shows that in the first five days of the month, the average temperature of the city remained between 20-22 degrees Celsius. In the second week, the minimum mercury levels saw a slight fall and went around 10-11 degrees Celsius. However following rains, the minimum temperatures again went up to 16- 18 degrees Celsius.

From 12.6 degrees Celsius on December 27, Nagpur’s minimum temperature significantly dropped to 5.1 degrees Celsius the following day. This was the third lowest minimum temperature for December in almost a century.

Nagpur: Instead of taking some action, the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) only shifted two of its officials who aided over 250 tractor trolleys in illegal excavation of sand from reserve forest area.

TOI on December 26 had reported how inquiry report nailed ST Meshram, assistant manager (AM) of Jamdi-I (Gondia), and range forest officers (RFOs) KJ Shinde and RN Lambat, under whose jurisdiction large-scale sand smuggling was going on.

The FDCM shifted Meshram to Ballarshah timber depot and Shinde to Kanhargaon in Chandrapur. Both have been given field postings again. Inquiry officer IV Kore has also been shifted to Yavatmal.

The corporation took illegal quarrying lightly and action on the inquiry report was taken two months after it was submitted, only when TOI reported the matter.

The GM of FDCM, who has powers to suspend officials up to the rank of RFOs, has recommended departmental inquiry (DE) against Shinde. It was expected all those involved would be suspended. No action has been recommended against Lambat who also connived with the private contractor for illegal quarrying. FDCM is also silent on recover of loss of royalty over Rs10 lakh from the contractor or from these officers.

Ankita Shah's father has cancer.

AHMEDABAD: In an age when women are increasingly wading into male-dominated professional sectors to create a space for themselves, Ankita Shah, 35, has shattered the gender stereotype to become Amdavad’s first specially abled rickshawwali! Shunning a desk job as a call-centre executive, Ankita has been driving a rickshaw for six months, to contribute towards her ailing father’s cancer treatment.A BA with Economics, Ankita is the eldest among five siblings, and hails from a family with modest background in Palitana, her native place. She had her right leg amputated due to polio, at an early age. After facing social ostracization over her disability, she moved to Ahmedabad in 2012 and began working at a call centre.“I used to barely make Rs 12,000 working a 12-hour shift at the call centre. Moreover, after my father was diagnosed with intestine cancer, I had to constantly shuttle between Ahmedabad and Surat for his treatment and getting frequent leaves was a problem. The income wasn’t enough. That’s when I decided to call it quits,” she said.Despite appearing for interviews at various private companies, Ankita could not get a job easily as her disability was cited as a concern by most employers. “It wasn’t an easy time. Making ends meet was difficult and I was feeling all the more guilty because I couldn’t contribute anything for my father’s treatment. I finally decided to do something on my own,” she added.The idea of driving an autorickshaw struck her but it was both challenging and raised eyebrows in the family too. But determined to improve her financial condition to be able to pay for her father’s treatment, while finding work-life balance, Ankita embraced it all. “I learnt driving a rickshaw from a friend – Lalji Barot – who is also physically challenged and drives a rickshaw. He not just taught me how to drive, but also helped me get a customized autorickshaw of my own – which has a hand-operated brake,” she said.Today, Ankita ferries her rickshaw for seven to eight hours and makes upto Rs 20,000 every month. “It is much better because there is no work pressure. I can also visit my family and help with my dad’s treatment,” said Ankita, who plans to start her own taxi business in the future.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063810,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-808608,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amdavads-specially-abled-rickshawwali/articleshow/73062231.cms

Nashik: The rail fare for second class travel between Nashik and Mumbai, Nashik and Aurangabad and Nashik and Bhusawal has been increased by Rs 5, following the announcement of fare rise by the railways on Tuesday.

According to railway officials, the fare for ordinary train travel to CSMT, Mumbai, or Aurangabad or Bhusawal or Jalgaon from Nashik has increased only by 1 paise per km with the an effective rise being Rs 5 in the tickets.

“The ticket for travel to CSMT, Aurangabad, Bhusawal or Jalgaon will now cost only Rs 5 more. The AC travel, however, will be costlier by Rs 10 on these routes,” sources in the railways said.

The fare for Rajdhani Express between Nashik and New Delhi has increased by Rs 55 for a single journey.

The railway officials said that this was the first fare revision since 2014-15 and that it had little impact on the fare.

“The hike in train fares is nominal because it is still much cheaper than road travel,” Ragini Patil, resident of Nashik and frequent traveller.

Akash Khairnar, a daily passenger, said that the monthly season ticket was not touched and it is the best thing to happen for them.

“Given the rising inflation, the Railways has done the right thing by not overburdening the passengers with steep hike in the fares. The current rise can easily be borne by commuters,” said Khairnar.

Another commuter, Shreekant Kulkarrni, said that the hike at a time when prices of all the commodities were rising is unfortunate. “The fuel prices have increased, and the rise in rail fares would only fuel inflation,” he said.

BAREILLY: Even as the temperature in Bareilly dropped below 10 degrees Celsius making mosquitoes inactive, the district recorded 683 cases of malaria in December, which in the corresponding month last year was reported to be 578.

District malaria officer DR Singh said, “Due to low temperature, the mosquito becomes inactive. As the density of mosquitoes reduces in December, the number of cases also decreases drastically. However, in September, more than 600 cases were being detected per day. Besides, a few people, who did not follow the full course of treatment, are still carrying the malarial parasite.”

According to health department officials, the number of positive cases is decreasing with the drop in temperature. Last year, Bareilly had reported 6,302 malaria cases in October, but it reduced to 1,912 in September. Officials said malaria cases are at its peak during July to mid-October due to monsoon.

Of the total 683 cases reported, 251 were of “killer” malaria strain plasmodium falciparum (PF), while 428 were of a milder form of malaria caused by plasmodium vivax (PV). However, four people were diagnosed with mixed forms of malaria carrying both PF and PV parasites.

Bareilly district reported nearly 24% increase in malaria cases in 2019 as compared to 2018. A total of 37,482 malaria cases were detected in 2018 in Bareilly, but the number rose to 46,717 in 2019. Of the total 46,717 cases reported in 2019, 11,753 were PF and 34,576 were PV and 388 were carrying both parasites.

As PF cases are still being reported, health department officials said they would conduct active case surveillance in the villages, where PF cases were detected. Under active case surveillance, health department teams hold a camp in a village to test all suspected cases.

The department has categorised 135 villages and two urban wards of Jagatpur and Subhashnagar as sensitive for reporting PF cases.

Of these 135 villages reporting PF cases, maximum numbers of villages are situated in Majhgavan block (62), followed by Bhamora (35), Ramnagar (14), Kyara (11), Fatehganj West (8), Meerganj (3) and Faridpur (1).

266,['2/01/2020'],MSRTC to set up eight charging ports for e-buses in city,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Nashik: To facilitate e-bus services from the city, Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ( MSRTC ) has decided to raise eight charging ports for buses at the Nashik depot-1.

“Currently we have been asked to initiate the procedure for creating infrastructure for power chargers at Nashik depot. Hence, we are in touch with the state electricity distribution company limited (MSEDCL) requesting it to provide us with the quotations for raising the same,” said a senior officer from MSRTC.

MSRTC is likely to start e-bus services on two additional routes — Nashik-Pune and Nashik-Mumbai — besides the Mumbai-Pune route.

Officials of the Nashik division of MSRTC said that it was likely that the MSRTC launched three buses on Pune route and three buses on Mumbai route. However, officials said that the Mumbai route seems to be the priority.

“Mumbai route could be taken up on priority as we already have Shivshahi air-conditioned buses running on the route and they could be replaced. Mumbai route could also be on the priority since it connects the state capital and contributes towards reducing pollution,” an MSRTC official said.

“The MSRTC will raise eight charging ports at the Nashik depot. The technical specifications required have been shared with the MSEDCL which could be presenting quotation to the MSRTC explaining it over the charges required,” he added.

“Once the quotation is received, we will process it and get the infrastructure ready for the buses,” the officer said.

The MSRTC Nashik-1 depot has eight bays where the maintenance and repairs of 177 busses are carried out. These bays are the ones that fulfill the demand of the MSRTC for taking care of its buses running on diesel. Since the e-buses will have lesser moving parts, their maintenance would also be restricted. However they will be required to be stationed for re-charging which currently is a tedious task that takes at least four hours.

Nashik: Shiv Sena is set to elect a party member as the Nashik Zilla Parishad president while the Nationalist Congress Party is likely to walk away with a vice-president’s post as three parties including Congress reached a consensus to keep the BJP at bay.

With the president and vice president completing their terms on December 20, the elections for the same will be held on Thursday. The Zilla Parishad has 73 members of which one seat is vacant. The Shiv Sena leads with 25 members, followed by NCP with 15 and Congress with eight members. The Maha Vikas Aghadi has 48-member strength and enjoys support from independence as well as the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

While the name of Shiv Sena’s Balasaheb Kshirsagar is making rounds for the presidential post, the name for the vice president is yet to come to a consensus among the NCP members, the sources said. “Kshirsagar is running ahead at this point in time for the post of president. The name for the vice-president is still under wraps given that several names from the NCP were vying for the post. However, both the names will be finalized by the respective party chiefs and the decision will be conveyed just before elections to the office,” the sources added.

The election process is scheduled to start from 11.00 am while the election in particular will be conducted at 1.45 pm.

Meanwhile, the election of the president and vice president seats of 15 Panchayat Samiti were held on Monday and the Shiv Sena reigned supreme in seven Samitis across the district. The party got its members elected as president and vice president in Igatpuri, Sinnar, Niphad, Dindori, Peth, Yeola and Nandgoan Panchayat Samitis.

The NCP bagged posts in Deola and Nashik, while the Maha Vikas Aghadi bagged the posts in Baglan Samiti. Kalwan saw an understanding between Congress and NCP, CPI-M to win the bragging rights in Surgana, an independent candidate won in Trimbakeshwar and BJP member in Chandwad Samiti.

Nagpur: The coal ministry has cancelled the allocation of Mahagenco’s Bhivkund coal block located in Chandrapur district for failing to start mining even after passage of over 11 years. The block had proven reserves of 100 million tonnes (MT) and was meant for a new 500MW unit. It is not clear whether the ministry will now allocate it to another company.

The block was allocated to the power generation company in July 2008. Mahagenco was supposed to start coal production from September 2015. However, it failed to obtain the major clearances required for starting mining. It had received several notices from the ministry in this regard but to no avail.

Over a decade ago, Mahagenco had been allocated Macchakatta coal block in Odisha. However, it failed to start mining there too and its allocation was cancelled after Coalgate. In August 2016, it was given the Gare Palma block in Chhattisgarh but the company has failed to get environmental clearance so far.

The company continues to face coal shortage due to its failure to start mining from its captive mines. The allocation of the coal block had raised the hackles of environmentalists. The coal block is named after Bhivkund nullah that lies on the road linking Chandrapur to Ballarpur. Bhivkund forest is very dense and is contiguous to Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) through Lohara jungle. It lies in the tiger corridor.

Chandrapur greens have demanded that now the block should be permanently cancelled so that destruction of the dense forests is prevented and tiger movement is not affected.

The ministry had recently cancelled allocations of six blocks given to state-run power generation companies of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Maharashtra. These coal blocks, with geological reserves of around four billion tonnes, had been allocated to these companies between 2007 and 2010 for future expansion. However, none of these power projects saw the light of the day and no significant development was made to operationalize these mines.

Jharkhand has lost the Moury (225.4 MT) and Kerandari BC (916.5 MT) blocks. The Pindrakhi (421.5 MT) and Puta Parogia (629.2 MT) blocks have been de-allocated from Chhattisgarh and Odisha lost the Bankhui (800 MT) block.

Hyderabad: Demanding that the varsity provides alternate accommodation to all pursuing PhD, the students of English and Foreign Languages University ( Eflu ) on Wednesday staged a protest on campus for the second consecutive day.

They said it was not fair on the varsity’s part to extend winter vacation at the fag end and added that this is causing severe inconvenience to students, especially hose doing their PhDs.

“There are no vacations for PhD students. They can’t give us three days’ time and ask us to vacate hostels. Many of us can’t go back to our hometowns owing to financial constraints and unrest in cities among other reasons. They should have at least given us a month’s time,” said a PhD student.

The vice-chancellor, however, said major renovations was underway at the varsity and added that they can’t make alternate arrangements for PhD students as they don’t have separate hostels. “They can’t cite financial constraints as we have already deposited their fellowship amount in their accounts today. We even assured to compensate them for the cancelled tickets as we have announced extension of winter vacation on December 30. We have requested them to book train tickets to leave for their hometowns. If any of their tickets are in waiting list, we will even talk to railway officials and try to get them confirmed,” said E Suresh Kumar, VC, Eflu.

272,['2/01/2020'],Submit status report in UCO Bank scam: HC asks CBI,"This story is from January 2, 2020

NAGPUR: Expressing acute displeasure over Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) reply regarding Rs25 crore scam in UCO Bank ’s loan disbursal scheme for farmers, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has directed the agency to submit a status report of its probe into the scam.

While hearing a suo motu criminal petition, a division bench led by justice Zaka Haq directed the premier investigation agency to file a report by January 21.

The UCO bank had floated a scheme to grant loans to the farmers/joint liability groups through industry/mill owners. The latter are required to prepare a list of farmers, who would be cultivating the crop (Soyabean), and they would remain guarantors of their repayment. The loan amount was supposed to be deposited into accounts of farmers/joint liability groups.

The Adilabad-based GS Oil Company in alleged connivance with the bank officers in Wardha and Hinganghat, sought loans of Rs25 crore on the basis of forged documents. After the amount was deposited into farmers’ accounts, it was immediately transferred into company’s account, which revealed that it was the actual beneficiary. After the fraud came to fore, the CBI registered offences against the company’s officials under IPC Sections 420, 468, 471, 34 and Section 13 (1) and 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act.

While hearing their anticipatory bail plea, when the court came to know about alleged involvement of the bank officials, it directed the registry to file a suo motu plea and appointed Rajnish Vyas as an amicus curiae .

Pointing out massive misappropriation of public money by the bank officials, the amicus said it was done in collusion with directors of private companies like GS Oil. Further accusing the bank officials of not cooperating with the CBI, he also charged the agency of showing disinterest in the entire case. He prayed for directives to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to call on all banks and financial institutions to file a suo motu complaint on financial frauds by framing appropriate guidelines and its strict monitoring.

He also demanded CBI to explore implementing Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) in such financial swindles. He termed the entire incident as a ‘systematic and organized crime’ committed by the bank officials through illegal transactions.

After, HC’s notices to respondents on July 22, 2017, including Wardha police, RBI and CBI, it took over two years for them to reply. Vyas again pointed out that the respondents failed to sufficiently explain the disbursement of huge loans and the transfer of amount farmers’ accounts to the account of oil company.

“The facts on record show that loan was sanctioned in farmers’ names, but there is nothing on record on the basis of which it can be accepted that the persons in whose names loans were sanctioned are farmers. On specific query, the CBI hasn’t been able to point out any material to show that those in whose name loan was disbursed were agriculturist at the relevant time,” the judges said, before adjourning the hearing.

Representative image

BAREILLY: The Bareilly Development Authority (BDA) has proposed to construct a 5-km-long road connecting Dohra road to Bisapur on the city outskirts. A survey for the project is going on in the area.

According to BDA officials, a wide road will facilitate commuters moving towards Ramganga Nagar Awasya Yojana, as the area currently lacks a connecting road suitable for vehicular movement.

Speaking to TOI, BDA vice-chairperson Divya Mittal said, “We are taking measures to develop BDA’s housing scheme Ramganga Nagar Awasya Yojana popular among the public. However, for increasing the number of visitors, it is important to make the area easily accessible but, at present, the connecting Bisalpur-Dohra road is damaged to the extent that it poses risk to motorists. Thus, for the convenience of commuters/visitors, we are considering to lay a 5-km-long and 42-meter-wide road. A survey is underway and as soon as the project gets approval, the construction work will commence.”

The development authority has been taking up various developmental projects in Ramganga Nagar to attract more and more customers and ensure settlement in its residential projects.

Besides, the BDA has announced to develop a ‘Science Park’ over seven-acre premises with an estimated cost of around Rs 1.7 crore to create awareness among youths about technology, job creation, facilitating start-ups and attracting home buyers to Ramganag Nagar Awasya Yojana, which is spread over 269 hectares.

Apart from this, the development authority has also proposed to develop a ‘Forest City’ (a semblance of forest) over 81,000 sq metres within the housing scheme at a cost of around Rs 20 crore with facilities such as open gym, children play area, garden, walkway, etc.

We felt as if we were in a hill station,” said Vinay Jagtap, an engineering student.

“The Nashik city climate is very pleasant during the last few days of December. I had come to Nashik to visit a winery for new year celebrations.

276,['2/01/2020'],"NMC drive to spot fine shops, hawkers starts","This story is from January 2, 2020

Nagpur: From Thursday, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will fine road and footpath encroachers on the spot.

On Wednesday, the civic body launched an intensive drive to free footpaths and roads from encroachments.

The decision was taken by mayor Sandip Joshi and municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar.

As per directives of Joshi, the committee headed by BJP corporator Dayashankar Tiwari finalized a spot fine of Rs 1,000 for hawkers. The fine will be triple (Rs 3,000) in case of a second violation. The seized material will be returned to hawkers after recovering 25% of its value. The fine will be Rs 500 in case the value of seized materials is below Rs 500. The NMC is recovering these charges since the past few years and will continue doing the same along with the newly introduced spot fine.

In the third instance, material seized from hawkers will not be returned. It will be auctioned by the NMC. The police department will initiate action according to section 102 of the Bombay Police Act. Violators will have to pay this fine in court.

In case of encroachments by shopkeepers, the spot fine will be Rs 5,000. It will be Rs 10,000 in case of a second violation. Material seized will not be returned in case of a third violation. It will be auctioned by the NMC along with police action. In this case, material will not be returned in the first two instances if the shopkeeper in question has not paid property tax.

The NMC will recover the spot fine similar to that of shopkeepers from leasehold shopkeepers. In this case, lease will be cancelled if any leaseholder encroaches footpath or roads or any public place for the third time.

Joshi had already announced a spot fine and stringent action to make footpaths walkable and roads free for motorists. He also announced development of Smart Kiosks to rehabilitate hawkers.

NMC implemented the spot fine and action as per the new policy which will be later approved by the standing panel and general body.

The NMC launched the drive in seven out of the ten zones on Wednesday. Three zones — Dhantoli, Nehru Nagar and Ashi Nagar — failed to launch the drive for reasons best known to them.

There was tension in Mahal Zone during the drive. Despite 60-70 hawkers opposing the move, the NMC successfully removed encroachments in Mahal market. Encroachments were cleared on the stretch between Narsing Talkies and Ghate Hotel, Kotwali police station and Kalyaneshwar Mandir and Zenda Square and Ladkika pul. In all, 75 encroachments were cleared.

In Laxmi Nagar Zone, the drive was conducted on West High Court (WHC) Road from Laxmi Nagar Zone to Khamla Square. Items of a tipper were seized.

Drive was conducted on WHC Road between Law College Square and Shankar Nagar Square and also on footpaths in Gokulpeth market.

Similarly, the drive was undertaken in various places in Satranjipura, Lakadganj, Hanuman Nagar and Mangalwari Zone.

Assistant commissioner (enforcement department) Ashok Patil, Sanjay Kamble and engineers of zones were present. Surprisingly, the nuisance detection squad (NDS) levied a fine of Rs400 on hawkers in some zones. The fine was not related to encroachments but for creating unhygienic conditions.

IN A NUTSHELL

Earlier System: NMC used to seize materials of hawkers and shopkeepers and take them to its godown. NMC used to return materials after recovering 25% of the total value of seized goods. There were no provisions for spot fine

New Policy: Spot fine introduced for the first time

Hawkers — Fine of Rs1,000 for first time, Rs3,000 for second instance. In first two instances, materials seized will be released to hawkers after recovering charges of 25% of total value of seized materials. Materials will be auctioned in case of third violation along with action from police as per section 102 of Bombay Police Act in which the hawker will have to pay the fine in court

Encroachments by shopkeepers in front of shops: A fine of Rs5,000. It will increase to Rs10,000 in case of a second violation. Material seized will not be returned in case of third instance and auctioned by the NMC along with police action. In this case, material will not be returned in the first two instances if the shopkeeper in question has not paid property tax

NMC leasehold shops: Fine similar to that of shopkeepers. In this case, lease will be cancelled if any leaseholder encroaches footpaths or roads or any public place for the third time

More Fine: Nuisance detection squad will levy a fine of Rs400 if waste or garbage is dumped by hawkers or shopkeepers on footpaths, roads or public places

277,['2/01/2020'],"With 230 babies, ‘Jiyo Parsi’ brings cheers","This story is from January 2, 2020

Karmin and Yazad Gandhi with their children Zaisha and Rayaan.

NEW DELHI: “230 and counting…” – that is the number of children born to Parsi couples since 2014, who benefitted from the Centre's ‘Jiyo Parsi’ scheme, aimed at arresting a sharp decline in the community's numbers. The scheme took off in 2013-14 as an urgent response to the 2011 census data that pitched the Parsi population at just 57,264- a steep drop from 1,14,000 in 1941.

A scheme to spur the mating instinct may have seemed esoteric, but it would seem some gains have been made. The data of 230 children pertains to those couples who benefited from medical reimbursements offered under ‘Jiyo Parsi’ for medical interventions like fertility treatments, Assisted Reproductive Technologies and counselling— all intended to preserve a community, which despite its small numbers, played a disproportionate role in national life, producing stellar cricketers, exceptional scientists and trail-blazing industrialists.

The good news is that the Parsi story is witnessing a turnaround of sorts with younger couples choosing to have not one, but two children. The 2021 census will be an important milestone that will reflect how far the community has been able to slow down the trend. Studies conducted in the past to assess the reasons for the decline pitched a worrisome picture of there being an average of one child below the age of 10 in nine families.

With Maharashtra being home to most Parsis followed by Gujarat , Mumbai-based Karmin and Yazad Gandhi’s story reflects the changing mindset. This year Christmas was special as it was Rayaan - their second born’s first big festival. He completes three months on December 30 and has an elder sister Zaisha who is 2.

The family is a beneficiary of the ‘health for community’ component of Jiyo Parsi, which includes financial assistance of Rs 4,000 for crèche support per child up to the age of 8 to couples who fall within a certain income bracket.

Professionals in the tourism industry, Karmin and Yazad, are candid that the crèche support for their first child helped them plan their second. Yazad, who was 28 when he got married, says, “I was a single child but I was clear about marrying early and having children so that I could grow with them. The advocacy at community events does motivate young people,” he shared.

A review of the Jiyo Parsi scheme of the ministry of minority affairs (MoMA) is set out in great detail in a report of the parliamentary standing committee on social justice. The committee, led by Rama Devi, has emphasised the need for a separate census for the Parsi community.

Recognising the importance of numbers to assess the changes on ground over the last decade, Shernaz Cama, Director UNESCO Parzor and National Director Jiyo Parsi Programme, said they have already started planning on the outreach to ensure that when the enumeration exercise for census 2021 starts next year, the community is ready to come forward to be counted.

TOI search of Jiyo Parsi community posts on social media platforms found that marriages and child birth make for big news. In one post, a mother shares a poem along with her baby’s photograph and speaks of her dream of having a child being the biggest joy of the world.

“Low rate of marriage, delayed marriage and the largest numbers of those never married till age of 40 has led to a decrease in the number of babies born. Therefore, it is important to change both marriage patterns as well as treat infertility which is a socio- psychological problem,"" the ministry said in a reply to the committee.

It has been found that because of the very large proportion of elders in the community, a younger couple often bears the responsibility of several elders.

The Jiyo Parsi scheme therefore also provides for a senior citizen honorarium of Rs 3000 for childcare per child per month up to the age of 10 years. Assistance of Rs 4,000 per month per person after the age of 60 years is also provided.

Representative image

BAREILLY: A crime branch team of Bareilly police busted an inter-state highway robbery gang and arrested six of its members with Rs 4 lakh cash and seized looted articles from their possession on Tuesday midnight.

The robbers belong to western UP districts and used to commit robberies in Bareilly, Lakhimpur Kheri, Unnao and Shahjahanpur districts, said police.

Police said they would carry the stolen material in a mini-truck and sell the items with the help of a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) dealer in Ghaziabad, identified as Kapil Tyagi. One of their members was earlier working with an FMCG production unit and he would provide the information about dispatched goods to the gang members, said police.

In Bareilly, the accused had stolen a truck carrying shampoo from Rudrapur in Uttarakhand to Bhamora area in Gujarat on December 8.

The accused were arrested after an encounter on Bhamora-Aonla state highway when they were on their way to Lucknow for delivering the looted items.

According to police, when they signalled the driver of the mini-truck to stop, he tried to run them over. The accused, then, opened fire at the crime branch team in a bid to evade their arrest.

However, in the ensuing gun battle, six of them surrendered before police while two escaped, said police. The accused were identified as Shahil alias Mushrat, Azeem and Sajid from Meerut, Anil Singh, Kapil Tyagi and Parvez from Ghaziabad district. The remaining two accused Sher Mohammed and Waseem alias Pradhan are absconding and police are searching for them, said police.

Giving details about their modus operandi, Bareilly SSP Shailesh Pandey told TOI, “The accused used to target FMCG consignments, which are easy to sell. having worked with FMCG companies in Rudrapur, Sher Mohammed is well aware of the information about products dispatch. The accused used to commit robberies using mini-truck of Waseem, while Kapil used to supply looted goods to small dealers at discounted rates. The gang has looted a shampoo consignment in Bareilly, biscuits in Shahjahanpur, chyawanprash in Unnao and Maggi in Kheri districts. We have booked them under IPC sections 395 (dacoity), 307 (attempt to murder) and under relevant sections of the Arms Act.”

Kolhapur: In a desperate attempt to retain power in Sangli zilla parishad (ZP), the BJP is riding its hopes on the differences among the functionaries of Congress, NCP, and Shiv Sena.

The ZP election for the post of president is set to be conducted on Thursday.

BJP state unit president Chandrakant Patil has expressed confidence that the party would win the election this time around. Mahavikas Aaghadi comprising of Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena has also shown its confidence to capture power by defeating BJP in the election.

Sangli MP Sanjay Patil is said to be upset over the selection of candidates for the post of president and vice-president. In reply, his four supporters were absent at the party meeting. But top functionaries have managed in convincing Patil about power-sharing.

The saffron party is also trying to capitalise on the difference of local Sena and NCP functionaries. Some BJP officials are in touch with Anil Babar and Ait Ghorpade, who have supporters in ZP as well as long-time detractors of NCP’s Jayant Patil.

Sources in the party said that Patil is expected to take a lead bringing together all anti-BJP forces but he is yet to take any initiative in that direction. Few independent members, who have an alliance with a local outfit, have not taken any decision yet. BJP in total has a strength of 28 members while NCP and Congress have 22 members.

Dehradun: Education secretary R Meenakshi Sundaram attached a joint secretary rank officer to the secretariat on Wednesday. The move comes two days after an audio clip went viral on social media platforms. In the clip, the officer can purportedly be heard seeking bribe from a school owner for issuing a No Objection Certificate for CBSE board affiliation.

Late on Tuesday night, a government order was issued for action against the accused official which said that ""such acts tarnish the image of the department and government”. Sundaram has also recommended suitable departmental action against the official, if he is found guilty.

In the two audio clips that went viral on social media, the official can purportedly be heard telling the principal of a private school that it’s not easy to get the affiliation as there are too many middlemen who have to be pleased to get the file cleared.

In the first audio clip, a man can be heard saying — “Pachaas tak to dena hi padega. Babu se le ke sab koi mangta hai (One has to shell out at least 50.. From a clerk to others, everyone demands).”

Responding to the demand, the school’s principal can be heard asking if the education minister will also be taking a share.

In the second audio clip, the official can purportedly be heard asking the school’s principal if he has made up his mind to pay the bribe or not.

“We have attached the official to the secretariat and have forwarded the matter to additional chief secretary Radha Raturi for further action as officials of joint secretary level are governed by secretariat administration, which is headed by her,” said R Meenakshi Sundaram.

Meanwhile, the official refused to talk on the issue saying that this is a conspiracy against him.

283,['2/01/2020'],"On first day of year, Rajpur Road sees massive traffic snarls","This story is from January 2, 2020

yyyyyyyyyyyy

Dehradun: A long stretch of Rajpur Road witnessed traffic holdovers on Wednesday with a large number of tourist vehicles (from Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh) contributing to the jam as many people who had come to hill stations like Mussoorie and Dhanaulti for New Year celebrations were returning home on the day.

As the Dehradun railway station has been shut for a few months for repair and reconstruction works, most of the tourists had driven to the hill state in their cars. The large number of four-wheelers prolonged the jam, with traffic moving at a snail’s pace for many hours.

When compared to previous years, the number of buses, cars and two-wheelers was significantly higher this year. As per sources, in the last few days of 2018, a total of 3,800 tourist vehicles had entered the hill stations near Doon. In 2019, the number went up to 4,500. Rajvir Pundhir, who was heading towards Nehru Colony on Wednesday afternoon, told TOI, “I had expected a light traffic jam as I knew that tourists would be returning home. However, the traffic jam was huge. Despite efforts by police and traffic personnel, the holdover was visible on almost the entire stretch of Rajpur Road.”

Meanwhile, police officials claimed that no traffic blockades were caused and that there was proper traffic management.

An official who did not wish to be named told TOI that a meeting was held with hotel owners before the start of New Year celebrations.“In the meeting, hotel owners were asked to provide parking slots to their customers. They were also told to request their customers to not use private vehicles for intra-city movement so as to avoid traffic jams.” As reported by TOI earlier, several tourists had flocked to popular tourist destinations across the state to welcome the New Year and majority of the hotels, resorts, and guest houses in hill stations like Mussoorie, Nainital, Mukteshwar, Auli, and Chakrata were packed to their capacity on December 31.

Police during inspection on Wednesday

Dehradun: A 41-year-old man, identified as Kapil Dev Arora, was found dead near his residence in city’s Karanpur area on Wednesday morning. While his family members and friends did not rule out the possibility of murder, police, on the basis of the CCTV footage, claimed that it was “not a murder but an accidental death.”

Arora’s family friend Nilay Mishra told TOI, “Kapil was a computer expert and was extremely fond of electronic gadgets. He had done MCA and used to run a cyber cafe on the ground floor of his house. In the last few years, many hostels have come up in the area and the students living in those often created nuisance and argued with locals.”

Mishra added that Kapil had an argument with a few hostel residents some time before his death.

“His family and friends strongly believe that his death may be a case of planned murder,” he added.

However after going through the footage of CCTV cameras of a neighbour’s residence, police said that Kapil might have died after falling from the first floor of a hostel.

SP City Shewta Choubey said, “The CCTV footage shows that he was trying to climb on to the first floor of a hostel situated next to his residence. During his attempt, the boundary grill broke and he fell on it.”

According to police, Kapil had an argument with some people in the late night hours of Tuesday and police constables, who were on the spot, had dropped him home. “The constables had handed over Kapil to his father Arjun Dev. Subsequently, Kapil was locked in a room by his father, but he managed to come out through the window of the room. Prima facie, it appears to be a case of accidental death but we are probing other aspects as well,” Choubey said.

285,['2/01/2020'],‘Scrap exemption for PhD holders from NET/SET’,"This story is from January 2, 2020

NAGPUR: Several city teachers, under the banner of All India NET/SET Teachers Organization and National Forum for Quality Education, have urged Kasturirangan Committee, tasked with drafting National Education Policy (NEP), to make National Eligibility Test (NET) and State Eligibility Test (SET) as recruitment exam.

They also demanded that PhD holders shouldn’t be given any exemption during recruitment and they be asked to clear the two entrances.

Presently, the NET and SET are treated as only eligibility test while recruitment is 100% based on personal interview of the candidates.

Through 2018 regulation, University Grants Commission (UGC) had exempted PhD holders from appearing in NET/SET for their appointment as teachers.

Though teachers’ bodies had opposed the move then, UGC refused to heed the concern. “The NET/SET exemption was not only unfair to 8 lakh qualified candidates across India but also led to dilution of research standards,” the teachers had claimed.

Even as the NEP is being framed, the UGC recently wrote to all universities asking them to make its ‘Research and Publication Ethics’ credit course compulsory for all PhD students as part of pre-registration course work.

“Introducing these two courses on Publication Ethics and misconduct is mere farce and an attempt to legalize the temporary exemption to PhD holders from mandatory NET /SET examinations,” said Ramesh N Zade, president, National Forum for Quality Education.

“If PhD is removed as eligibility for teaching positions and promotions, its ethics, standard and quality will certainly improve,” said Kushal M Mude, convener, All India NET SET Teachers Organization.

In their suggestions and feedback to the NEP draft committee, both the bodies have pointed out the importance of NET/SET upheld by different committees between 1983 and 2016.

Mehrotra Committee, comprising 18 members, was constituted in 1983 and after comprehensive survey and deliberations it had prescribed qualifying in NET as an essential condition for recruitment for the post of lecturer in any university or college throughout the country. This qualification was not to be relaxed even in the case of candidates possessing MPhil and PhD at the time of recruitment. These recommendations were introduced in NEP 1986 after discussion in the Parliament.

In 2007, Mungekar Committee in its final report removed exemptions to MPhil and PhD.

TSR Subramanian Committee, comprising five members, had submitted its report on ‘Evolution of New Education Policy’ in April 2016 and had recommended NET/SET as mandatory for teachers in higher education. The committee noted that there has been improvement in the quality of candidates joining higher education institutions as teachers as a result of NET.

286,['2/01/2020'],Irrigation project cost jumps 21 times &amp; work is yet to start,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Nagpur: The Lower Painganga dam being built in farm suicide-hit Yavatmal district may soon turn out to be another white elephant surpassing even Gosikhurd dam in terms of burgeoning cost.

Approved in 1997 at an initial cost of Rs1,402 crore in Ghatanji tehsil of Yavatmal district, even the basic construction work is yet to begin and it may now take Rs29,000 crore to finish the project.

In 2009, the first escalation taking the cost to Rs10,400 crore was approved. Now, another estimate of Rs29,000 crore has been drawn for the project and approval is awaited. As against this, the yearly fund allocation for the works has been in couple of crores only.

In comparison to that, current approved cost of Gosikhurd dam, which has been in the limelight for alleged irrigation scam, stands at Rs18,400 crore. The targeted irrigation potential for Lower Painganga is almost close to that of Gosikhurd at 2.27 lakh hectare.

In Gosikhurd, nearly half of the target of creating irrigation potential for 2.5 lakh hectare has been achieved. On the other hand, work on the Lower Painganga dam has been shelved since 2012 by Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC).

A change in the design will now take the cost of Lower Painganga to Rs29,000 crore. A latest proposal has been put up before the state government over a year ago. All the VIDC has done so far is acquisition of 900 hectare forest land and over 700 hectare private holding.

As the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court disposed off a PIL seeking early completion of the project, it also directed the beneficiary states — Maharashtra and Telangana — to seek central assistance for expediting funds and pitch for making it a national project like Gosikhurd. The PIL was disposed off in 2017.

Maharashtra government had informed the HC that it had extended the deadline for the project completion to 2044, following fund crunch.

The main reason for the VIDC to have stopped the work is poor fund allocation. The VIDC has ended up spending a mere Rs330 crore in the last 22 years, which comes to Rs15 crore a year. For the 2019-20, the allocation for Lower Painganga is as low as Rs2.75 crore.

There is opposition from the locals to land acquisition which has also pushed back the work. VIDC needs to take over more than 19,000 hectare land for the project. Locals were against acquisition probably due to the low rates offered at that time. Now, five-fold hiked price has to be given under the new land acquisition law. However, even if the locals may find the deal lucrative, the VIDC does not have enough funds for buying the land, said a source. For land acquisition alone, the VIDC needs Rs4,700 crore.

The stopping of the work has also a political colour. Congress leaders in Yavatmal have blamed Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government for deliberately neglecting the project.

Former MPCC president Manikrao Thakre said, “It’s a huge project that would have changed the fortunes of Yavatmal and adjoining areas where highest number of farm suicides have taken place. The last government under Fadnavis unfortunately put the project on the back burner following stiff opposition by BJP legislators, who were opposing land acquisition for the project from their respective constituencies. Now, we would raise the issue with concerned ministers in our government for early completion of the mega project. Allocation is the major problem and we will convince the government to seek central funds for it, as directed by the high court.”

287,['2/01/2020'],Mahavikas Aaghadi falls in Solapur ZP elections,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Kolhapur: The Mahavikas Aaghadi suffered a major setback in the Solapur zilla parishad (ZP) election as six members of Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena rebelled against the party decided to vote for BJP-led alliance.

BJP’s Aniruddha Kambale was elected as the president by bagging a total of 37 votes. Dilip Chavan secured 35 votes to be appointed as a new vice-president. The election had garnered interest in political circles as NCP had made it a prestigious issue after its debacle in the Lok Sabha election.

Mahavikas Aaghadi — the ruiling alliance of NCP, Congress, and Shiv Sena — was strong on paper with Karmala MLA Sanjay Shinde taking a keen interest in the election on the instruction from deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.

However, Mahavaikas Aaghadi failed to capture power as four Sena members decided to join hands with BJP instead of Congress and NCP. Four Sena members are supporters of former Sena MLA Narayan Patil, who was denied ticket in the 2019 Assembly elections. The four members had contested the election on Sena symbol but defied party decision. Patil was expelled from Sena in the election as he had rebelled against official candidate Rashmi Bagal, who eventually lost the Karmala seat.

The Solapur the outcome is considered as an eye-opener for Mahavikas Aaghadi as senior leaders like deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Sanjay Shinde, and Baban Shinde, both MLAs Ganpatrao Deshmukh and Dilip Sopal have come together to keep BJP at bay.

BJP functionaries managed to keep its members united as influential leaders like Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil, Samadhan Autade, and Prashant Paricharak continued their support for BJP. All these leaders had come together in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, because of which Congress and NCP lost two seats in the Solapur district.

In the last election, Sanjay Shinde, now with NCP, had become president with the help of BJP. Shinde resigned from the membership after he got elected as MLA. BJP managed to attract four Sena members by offering them ZP president post and ensuring anti-BJP parties do not come into power

288,['2/01/2020'],Swachh Survekshan 2020: Nashik features in top 10 list,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Nashik: Nashik city has featured among the top 10 cities (in more than 10 lakh population category) in the Swachh Survekshan League 2020 (Quarter 1 and Quarter 2).

Swachh Survekshan was introduced with the objective of sustaining the on-ground performance of cities along with continuous monitoring of service level performance in terms of cleanliness.

SS League 2020 is being conducted in three quarters, i.e. April-June, July-September and October-December 2019. The survey allots 2,000 marks for each quarter and is evaluated on the basis of monthly updation of details by cities along with citizen’s validation on the 12-service level progress indicators through outbound calls.

Union ministry of housing and urban development on Tuesday declared the ranks of top 20 cities. In the first quarter assessment, Nashik secured 4th rank in the country while it slipped to the 7th rank in the second quarter assessment.

Nashik is the first city in the state to be featured in the top 10 list. In the second quarter, it secured the second spot with Navi Mumbai being the first.

Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials are optimistic that the city will rank better than last yer in the final Swachh Survekshan results as 25% weightage of the quarterly assessments would be included in the annual survey scheduled to commence from 4 January till 31 January 2020.

The performance of cities in Swachh Survekshan League 2020 is crucial to their ranking in the survey due to the 25% weightage of the quarterly assessments to be included in the annual survey.

“Nashik has improved its ranking considerably from 63rd position to among top ten clean cities in the country. This is because of the joint efforts of officials, citizens, corporators and other institutions. We are confident that Nashik will emerge top clean cities in the country in Swachh Survekshan 2020,” said municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game.

“In Swachh Survekshan 2020, there are around 40 different indicators such as garbage lifting, garbage segregation, waste composting, cleanliness drive, public toilets, cleanliness of roads and markets etc. We tried to perform well in all segments, resulting in the city’s improved ranking in the first two quarters,” added Game.

“If citizens, corporators and officials work together, I am confident that Nashik will secure the first rank in the survey,” said Game.

Nashik city failed to perform well in Swachh Survekshan 2019 as its ranking among 425 cities had dropped from 63 in 2018 to 67 in 2019.

Citizens’ feedback accounts for 35 percent of the marks in the survey that is at the threshold. According to the data compiled by union ministry of housing and urban affairs, there had been poor response from citizens about their feedback related to cleanliness and sanitation status in their cities.

BAREILLY: Power consumers can now get registered under the ‘easy installment scheme’ till January 31.

The Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) had launched easy installment scheme in November under which domestic power consumers in urban areas with up to 4KW load were able to pay their dues in 12 easy installments while rural consumers can pay pending bills in 24 installments after registration. The last date has been extended from December 31 to January 31.

Speaking to TOI on Wednesday, Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (MVVNL) superintending engineer, rural, Tariq Jalil said, “The special scheme was launched hardly a month ago. December 31 which was the earlier deadline was too short to make power consumers aware and for them to avail it on time. Therefore, the last date has been extended till January 31, for the convenience of consumers. Around 21,000 rural power consumers in Bareilly district have so far got registered under the scheme since November.”

Sub-divisional officer (SDO), Bareilly, Sathyarth Gangwar said, “Around 3,800 urban power consumers have availed to the scheme and registrations are under process. To ensure that maximum power consumers avail the scheme, state government has extended the registration period by a month. We have been sensitizing people through media while consumers visiting power department offices are also being made aware about it.”

UP energy minister Shrikant Sharma had introduced the easy installment scheme in November 2019, with an aim to tackle the problem of power dues which is a major issue in UP. Under the scheme, LMV-1 (domestic/residential) category electricity consumers in urban and rural areas (having a load of up to 4 KW) can avail the scheme by simply paying 5% of the dues or minimum Rs 1,500 (whichever is higher)as first installment.

Domestic consumers of urban areas will get the benefit to pay entire dues in 12 monthly installments and domestic consumers of rural areas will get the benefit to pay entire dues in 24 monthly installments and during the period, late payment surcharge penalty on the dues till October 31 will be waived.

Nashik: The average wholesale onion price crashed by Rs 1,000 per quintal — from Rs 4,500 per quintal on Tuesday to Rs 3,500 per quintal on Wednesday — at Lasalgaon APMC, the country’s largest wholesale onion market.

The increase in the supply of onions has led to the drop in the average wholesale price.

In Nashik retail markets, onions were being sold for Rs 45-60 per kg on Wednesday. The drop in wholesale prices are expected to reflect in the retail markets in the next couple of days. The retail onion prices are expected to drop to below Rs 50 a kg soon.

The supply of fresh kharif onions has increased over the past few days. The daily supply at the Lasalgaon APMC has increased to about 22,000 quintals a day. A fortnight ago, it was receiving just about 12,000 quintals every day. This increase in supply has helped bring down the average wholesale onion price, said APMC officials.

On Wednesday, the minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon were recorded at Rs 2,000 and Rs 4,551 per quintal, respectively.

We expect the trend of wholesale onion prices to be downward now. The supply will further increase once the arrival of kharif onions becomes regular by the second half of January. The average wholesale onion prices are expected to drop to Rs 2,000 per quintal in the next 10-12 days, said APMC officials.

Usually, the arrival of fresh kharif onions begins by mid-October, but the unseasonal rain had badly affected the kharif crop across Maharashtra this time. Around 75% of the onion plantations were damaged. This created scarcity of onions that shot up the average wholesale onion prices, added the officials.

But the acreage of late kharif onions has increased in the district to around 45,000 hectares. Now, the harvest of late kharif onions is expected to gather momentum.

Representative image

RAMPUR: At least six more protesters — all aged between 25 and 30 years — were arrested in Rampur on Wednesday after they were “identified from video footage” during a protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act which turned violent at Hati Khana Chauraha on December 21. These protesters were allegedly involved in pelting stones at police personnel, vandalising property and setting ablaze police jeep and bikes.

Rampur superintendent of police (SP), Ajay Pal Sharma, said the arrests were made only after a thorough probe, while family members of the arrested claimed they were innocent. The arrested persons appeared in video footage collected from the protest site, police said. All the arrested persons were presented before the court of the chief judicial magistrate and sent to jail under heavy police escort on Wednesday. Earlier, 18 protesters were reportedly arrested and sent to jail.

Police had also allegedly recovered a .32 caliber bore pistol and two live cartridges from the possession of one of the arrested protesters, identified as Nadeem. Rampur SP told TOI that initial probe indicated that the pistol recovered was used in firing during the protests. “We are investigating the presence of pistol at the protest site and will also seek police custody remand (PCR) of Nadeem for further questioning,” the SP added.

Police arrested the protesters under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapons ), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 307 (attempt to murder), 302 (murder), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force) and under sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act 1984. Section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act has also been invoked against the anti-CAA protesters.

The six arrested persons have been identified as Shimmi, Nadeem, Qayam Mian, Amir Ali, Nazim and Zahid. They were picked up by the Kothwali Sadar police officers.

Meanwhile, Nadeem’s family members said that he owns a grocery shop near the Hati Khana Chauraha. His elder brother Sharief said, “When police arrested Nadeem, we approached senior police officers, and they showed a video footage where Nadeem was purportedly seen. He was seen speaking on his mobile phone. Now, we will approach the court for his bail.”

Another protester was identified as 27-year-old Nazim, a city-based truck driver. Nazim’s elder brother Asif, who runs a paan shop at Pharai gate locality, said, “Nazim is the lone breadwinner. He has four children. He is innocent. But, police officers told us that he was involved in the protest and they have video clips. Now, we’ll approach the court.”

The family members of Shimmi, Qayam, Amir and Zahid have all claimed that they were not involved in the December 21 violent protests and police are concocting stories, mainly, for damage claims.

Rampur district magistrate Aunjaneya Kumar Singh had earlier ordered a magisterial probe into the death of 27-year-old Faiz Khan, an alleged protester.

295,['2/01/2020'],Bhujbal disapproves of NMC’s city bus project,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Nashik: State cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal on Wednesday expressed his reservations about the civic body’s decision to take over the city bus service from the ailing Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ( MSRTC ) and roll out swanky vehicles.

Talking to reporters, Bhujbal said this new bus service would add a financial burden of around Rs 100 crore on the cash-strapped Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC).

The NMC will incur an expenditure of over Rs 100 crore and this will also put an additional tax burden on residents. Therefore, instead of running the city buses itself, the NMC should provide some funds to the MSRTC to enable it to operate the service effectively, Bhujbal said.

The NMC’s preparations are already in the final stages of taking over the service from MSRTC.

Bhujbal’s statement comes when NMC is in the final stages of rolling out the city bus service. The bus service is to be operated on GCC (gross cutting contract) system for a period of 10 years. This includes the purchase of new buses, maintenance of buses, employing drivers, purchasing fuel, etc. The municipal corporation will pay charges to private agencies on a km basis. NMC has already finalised three agencies to operate all 400 buses in the city, including 200 CNG, 150 electric and 50 diesel buses. It has given letters of intent to the three agencies.

Two of the three agencies have also deposited the necessary bank guarantee to the civic body, while the third agency is expected to do so in the next few days.

NMC officials said they are planning to sign an agreement with these three agencies in a week or two. As per norms, each agency will have to deploy at least 50 buses within three months from the date of signing the agreement.

NAGPUR: Despite the post midnight downpour presenting challenge before police personnel deployed to check drunk driving on New Year’s Eve, they managed to nab 592 revellers who were driving under the influence of alcohol between 9pm on Tuesday and 6am on Wednesday. The action was taken at 50 nakabandi points at different locations set up by city police, including traffic cops and police station staff.

Rain also helped in a way as many revellers stayed indoors, bringing down the number of drunk driving case this year by almost half as compared to last year. Last year, city police had registered 1,069 drunk driving cases on New Year’s Eve.

DCP traffic Chinmay Pandit said, “It’s because of our arrangements the New Year night passed off without any major incident or accident. The bandobast started in the evening but heavy rain created complications for the cops during nakabandi. Had there been no rain, the number of drunk driving cases would have increased. Our staff did not leave their position and kept vigil on revellers.”

Among the 10 traffic zones, the maximum drunk driving cases were detected at Indora and Kamptee with 80 and 85 revellers getting caught respectively. At Sonegaon, which is the entry point for traffic coming from Wardha Road where several dhabas are located, registered the least number of cases — 43.

Till 9pm on Tuesday, cops had registered 103 drunk driving cases. With time the number increased. Around 110 cases were detected between 11pm and midnight. The most number of drunk drivers, 176, were nabbed between midnight and 2am on Wednesday.

Ahead of New Year’s Eve, the traffic department under DCP Pandit had launched crack down against drunk driving. Cops had also identified several sensitive points to avoid accidents and kept tight police bandobast throughout the night.

298,['2/01/2020'],KMC reduces supply as water level declines in barrage,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Kolhapur: The water supply department of the civic administration has reduced the water supply in some of the areas due to the decline of the water level at Shinganapur barrage .

The water is pumped from Shinganapur barrage located along the Panchganga river.

The water level is currently at 534.70 feet, which is below the required water level.

The water supply department has reduced the water supply and changed the timings in certain areas. For instance, Shahunagar, on Wednesday, received water one hour late and it lasted for two hours. Usually, the water supply to most of the areas is for at least three hours once in a day.

A senior water department official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “There is a major leakage in the barrage. We are going to carry out the repair work soon. The water level at the barrage has gone down. We have requested the water resources department to release more water from the upstream dams to maintain an adequate level. We have reduced the water supply in some areas which receive water twice a day for more than three hours.”

The water resources department (WRD) asked the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) to repair the leakages immediately and has not taken any decision yet to release more water from the dams. The WRD officials said that the water in the dams is meant for crisis situations such in summer when the demand for both drinking and irrigation are high.

The corporators are upset over reducing the supply of the water. Chhaya Powar, Congress corporator said, “Without consulting the local corporators, the decision was taken along with changing the timings of water supply. If there is any crisis, then the administration should inform us so that we can do something.”

The corporators complained to the standing committee chairman Sharangdhar Deshmukh. “I have scheduled a special meeting to discuss the issues related to water supply on Saturday. We have faced similar situations before. We will get the plan ready from the water supply department to address the water scarcity that is likely to occur in summer,” said Deshmukh.

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has issued the tenders for appointing a firm for the repair work of the barrage. The KMC has set the deadline of May end to complete the task.

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: The election for the post of president and deputy president of Kolhapur Zilla Parishad have piqued interest considering the changed political equations in the state and the denial of minister berth to senior Congress MLA P N Patil.

The BJP-led alliance has held the posts for the last two-and-half years but the new Mahavikas Aghadi could prove a hurdle in retaining the position.

The voting for the two posts will take place on Thursday afternoon. The nominations for the posts will have to be filed before 2 pm. The election proceeding will be video-graphed.

Members of ZP have been taken to undisclosed location and they will be bought back by late night or early morning of Thursday. Senior office-bearers of the parties will be meeting the members before they cast their vote.

To win the posts, the parties must be at least 34 votes. Congress and NCP, which are in the opposition, on Wednesday claimed to have the support of 35 members, while a similar claim has been made by BJP-led alliance.

All eyes are on the stand to be adopted by the supporters of Congress MLA P N Patil, who was not made a minister in the state government. Several of the ZP members are unhappy with the Patil’s exclusion and may abstain from voting. At least five members are known supporters of Patil and could prove a worry for Cong-NCP alliance.

The BJP-led alliance has power in the ZP since last two and half years but the five Congress members are in touch with the BJP. Minister of state Satej Patil, who is from Kolhapur, is making all the efforts to convince them to vote for Congress nominee.

According to the sources, a meeting was held between the leaders of Cong-NCP alliance and Shiv Sena on Wednesday evening. Shiv Sena members led by former MLA Chandradip Narke have decided to support Cong-NCP alliance.

BJP state president Chandrakant Patil and several leaders of Tararani Aghadi, led by Mahadevrao Mahadik, are ensuring their members do not support Congress-NCP alliance. Sources in BJP claimed that they have got the support of two members of Swabhimani Paksha led by former MP Raju Shetti, who is unhappy with Congress and NCP.

MANGALURU: Two weeks after violent protests against CAA left two protesters dead in Mangaluru, various organisations and individuals have contributed over Rs 2 crore to help their families and those who were injured in the clashes.

“Funds started pouring in after Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa rolled back Rs 10 lakh compensation to the families of each victim that he had announced after the violence,” said a police officer who is probing the violence.

Former MLA BA Mohiuddeen Bava is among those who are involved in collecting the funds. However, he refused to divulge details about the money collected so far. “Contributions may stop if we reveal this information. We are trying to help the victims’ families and the injured. They are facing financial difficulties after the recent violence,” he said.

On December 19, anti-CAA protests turned violent and a mob allegedly tried to attack a police station. Nauseen Kudroli, 49, and Jaleel Bengre, 23, were killed when Mangaluru police opened fire to control the protesters. Sources said that over 12 people, who were injured during the protests, are still being treated at various hospitals in the coastal city.

“Over Rs 2 crore has been collected to help the victims. Contributors have decided that Rs 25 lakh each will be given to Kudroli and Bengre’s families. The rest will be given to the injured protesters. We don’t know when the funds will be handed over to them,” a senior police officer told TOI.

Former CMs Siddaramaiah and HD Kumaraswamy have already announced compensation to the victims’ families. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee recently announced Rs 5 lakh each for the two families.

BAREILLY: A 55-year-old farmer was injured by a tiger in Kaanp Tanda village which falls in Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve on Wednesday.

The farmer received injuries on both of his hands and right leg and was admitted to a community health centre in Bheera. This is the third such tiger-human encounter in Kheri district since Saturday — leaving one dead and wounding three persons at different locations in Lakhimpur Kheri district.

The latest victim of tiger attack was identified as Paragu Bihari, a resident of Kaamp Tanda village. He was walking towards his field when a tiger suddenly appeared in front of him from a cane field and pounced on him. Paragu immediately screamed for help and a few villagers working at a nearby field rushed to rescue him.

There has been a significant rise in the total census of tigers in the state with maximum number of tigers, nearly 100, present in Kheri district. The earlier records show that the tiger attacks were found to be higher in winter season. Tigers usually move out of forest area to sugarcane fields in search of their prey. Many tigers take shelter inside sugarcane fields for months and hunt wild boars and Nilgai with much ease. Forest department has already alerted all the outlining villages to refrain from entering the forest area and move in groups, especially near sugarcane fields.

Speaking to TOI, divisional forest officer (buffer) Anil Patel said, “We have already alerted the residents of the villages located on forest outskirts. They were advised to move in groups, especially near forest area, but still they move alone and ignore our warnings. We have also offered the villagers in Kaamp Tanda village to relocate outside the forest area with a decent compensation but they are yet to agree on the proposal. Fortunately, the victim of today’s tiger attack is stable and he will be released from the hospital soon.”

NAGPUR: Many who partied hard as well as those preferring to go about as usual, spent the New Year Day waiting in long queues outside the Motor Vehicle Court on the premises of Nyay Mandir in Civil Lines after they and their vehicles were caught in drunk driving cases.

Probably for the first time, the offenders included people whose vehicles were used at the time by revellers in a state of inebriation. Generally, owners of vehicle caught while driven by minors were booked in such a fashion.

Traffic cops, who conducted on spot breathanaylser test, clubbed Sections 184 and 185 with 180 of the Motor Vechile Act (MVA) to fix responsibility on vehicle owners too.

While Sections 184 and 185 pertain to rash driving under influence of alcohol, 180 holds an individual accountable for permitting unauthorized persons to drive vehicles. Vehicle owners are levied a fine of Rs1,000 while it is Rs3,000 for first-time drunk drivers and Rs4,000 for repeat offenders. Rs500 too was imposed on several offenders for driving without licenses taking the total penalty to Rs4,500 to Rs5,000.

A woman doctor, whose compounder was caught drunk by cops, was penalized Rs1,000 beside having to wait all day in the serpentine queue.

She said she had given her scooterette to the employee to get a water can for the hospital but the man went for a drink on Umred Road. She coughed up a total fine of Rs4,500 as she had to pay for her employee as well.

Several youths too were imposed a cost of Rs3,000 each for drunk driving and Rs500 in absence of license.

This brought a windfall for small time lawyers who made a quick buck. The lawyers and their agents were seen outside the JMFC court luring gullible citizens. The lawyers charged Rs300 for assistance till the case is heard and settled. Agents charged 50% of the lawyers fee for bringing clients though the cases don’t need legal assistance.

Adv Suresh Shinde said he got seven cases while other days he there are just one or two.

Adv Sanjay Takode said people can do it on their own but they don’t want to take any risk of missing any documents which will entail coming again. “The registration certificate had to be presented before the judge with identification documents and valid license. First time offenders are not much aware of all these formalities,” he said.

Both, Shinde and Takode, said there is no way lawyers can get the penalty waived off once a drunk driving case in filed but people feel comfortable having a counsel by their side.

Adv Vihang Sakhare said the New Year celebration period is bringing good income for not just lawyers but also the government. “Over 500 cases have been made. The per day collection goes up to Rs3lakh to Rs 5lakh for the government,” he said.

I am a resident of Civil Lines, and have been preparing compost for the last 8 to 10 years. I read an article in The Economic Times about using kitchen waste in home gardens, and it inspired me to take up this green practice.

I had to partake in a number of trial and error methods to check which one was suitable for me, on the basis of availability of time and other resources. I started watching videos and undertook comprehensive research to adopt a sustainable system.

I collect vegetable and fruit scraps, and discard them in the flower bed. This mixes with the soil and improves the moisture content. The flowers grow in full bloom, owing to the enriched soil. When I started this process, I faced the problem of rodents creating a menace. Upon looking for other options, I found one that made use of old earthen pots.

I dispose of the overcooked and leftover food in the earthen pot, which has a hole at its bottom. Once the remains are drained out, it can be used as compost, too. I have used this organic waste mixed with soil in saplings to present as a gift to near and dear ones.

The earth gives us several resources in abundance, but we don’t know how to manage them. We don’t have the patience, and expect everything to be ready-made. Even after studying science in school, many people do not understand the value of this organic matter. We are facing many problems, and it is important to wake up right now and act on it.

I hope that citizens read up about various methods of putting their waste to use, and embrace them to play their part in saving the environment from mounting garbage heaps. Organic waste is black gold , and we must find the right way to utilize it to its full potential.

Dahisar Chowky also intercepted the highest number of drunk two-wheeler riders at 50 cases.Mumbai traffic police also recorded 601 cases of signal jumping, 258 cases of triple seat and 241 of speeding.In Navi Mumbai, the increase in cases was attributed to more policemen being deployed. “A majority of offenders were motorcyclists aged between 25 to 35 years. Despite Kharghar being a no-liquor zone with no wine shops or permit rooms, we still caught 25 people for drunk driving there. The reason could be tipplers consuming liquor at bars in other areas and returning home to Kharghar,” said Navi Mumbai ACP (traffic) Rajendra Chavan. Kalamboli traffic unit recorded highest number of cases in Navi Mumbai.In Thane, traffic police also booked 188 co-passengers for knowingly travelling in a vehicle steered by a drunk driver.“Thane has shown a dip in drunk driving on New Year's Eve because we had conducted consistant drives two days prior to New Year’s Eve.

Shinde had filed an appeal with Kumar regarding an “unsatisfactory” reply he got from Worli and Byculla police over Right to Information (RTI) Act queries. In December, Shinde had sought details under RTI on Worli police’s seizure of Rs 4 crore cash from a car during the state assembly elections in October.

“I had sought information regarding the seizure of cash as well as a job racket registered at Agripada police where BMC jobs were given on the basis of fake documents. In both cases, Mumbai police gave me evasive replies. Hence, I filed an appeal before DCP Kumar who was to hear me on December 27,” said Shinde.

Shinde had taken along a friend, Jitendra Kataria, to Kumar’s office.

Shinde alleged Kumar was aggressive and within minutes the discussion turned ugly. “I was polite to him and was listening sincerely but Kumar was rude and aggressive. All of a sudden, he got furious and jumped on his table and then pounced on me and began to hit me ruthlessly.” Shinde said when he tried to run, Kumar called his colleagues who pulled him back in the cabin. “They caught me and helped Kumar beat me till I fell unconscious.”

A bleeding Shinde was handed over to Byculla police where cops allegedly told him there was no point in complaining against Kumar, while apologising on his behalf, and advised him to say he fell off a chair. “A few policemen visited me in hospital and tried to convince me to change my mind about filing a complaint.”

Denying the allegation, Kumar said, “Nothing of this sort happened. He got injured after falling off a chair. The complaint is an afterthought as he is in the habit of being rude and of misbehaving. Four diary entries have been made against him for misbehaving with senior policemen. Secondly, the information he had sought under RTI was not relevant to him.”

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has entrusted Kerala State Pollution Control Board (PCB) for testing and notifying alternative materials that can substitute the banned single-use plastic items in the state.

The department of environment has directed PCB to test the suitability of the alternatives for single-use plastic items with the assistance of CSIR-National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science & Technology, Thiruvananthapuram .

Following the ban on single-use plastic items in the state, the demand for alternative materials has risen considerably in the state.

According to officials, many have approached state government with the claim to have discovered alternatives for the banned plastic, that are compostable as well as biodegradable. PCB will be responsible for checking the suitability of the alternative materials and it has to be lab tested and verified before they are brought to the market.

The Union government has identified “compostable plastic” as one of the alternatives to the regular plastic. The rules specify standards/norms for “compostable plastic”. Further, to promote the use of such plastic, the restrictive provision of 50 microns minimum thickness is not applicable to carry bags.

Further, a committee has been constituted by Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology (CIPET) with respect to research and development for compostable/biodegradable technologies on plastic. Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 define the norms for compostable plastic as an ecologically sustainable and green alternative of plastic. The rules prohibit the use of plastic bags with thickness less than 50 microns.

As per the reply furnished by Prakash Javadekar, minister for environment, forest and climate change , in Lok Sabha in November 2019, the guidelines suggest jute bags, cloth bags, paper bags as alternatives to plastic carry bags.

The minister has said that sufficient alternatives were available for plastic cutlery such as paper plates and leaf plates, paper/earthen cups and glass, wooden spoons, paper straws, multi-layered (aluminum + paper) pouches in place of container and container lids, wooden trays, stirrers made of wood.

Apart from the traditional material, new material like bagasse-based products, banana stem-based products are widely available in market, the reply pointed out. For the portion of plastic in items like ear buds sticks, balloons sticks, flags, candies, etc, wood/bamboo/paper, etc were suggested as easily available options. The other alternatives presented by Javadekar in Lok Sabha were cloth banner, lightweight textile fabric, wrinkle resistant warp knit, natural fibre-based sandwich board , resin-infused paper and partial boards.

AHMEDABAD: A teacher at a city school was shocked when she got hold of a note bearing the message “I love you” addressed to a girl. The message was circulating in Class I, at which stage kids are about 6 years old . The girl disavowed the note. The boy, thought to be its author, told the teacher that he liked the girl and for him ‘like’ and ‘love’ were interchangeable terms.A group of Class III girls (about 8 years old) of another school were busy discussing love affiliations and linking each other with the boys. When a teacher stepped in to shoot down the Cupid’s arrows flying around the class, the girls said they were only having fun. For their part, the boys seemed enamoured of only video games and gadgets.In yet another school, a girl in Class VII (about 12 years old) stopped talking after developing a crush on a new boy. She had speech problems and did not want him to notice that.Love, like the internet, is catching them young. Indeed, children are being exposed to the ideas of attraction and love through a host of mediums, primarily the mobile internet. But they seldom get the help of adults to tackle half-formed instincts.Driven perhaps by early hormonal changes or the loneliness that is inevitable in a nuclear family or when being brought up by a single parent, children are seeking solace from peers. But the peers themselves are a confused lot.“I am a homemaker and have all the time in the world to monitor my children,” said Kalpana Parikh, a mother of two teenage daughters. “But it is difficult to keep an eye on their WhatsApp chats. There, no topic is off-limit.” She went on to say: “Recently, I found my daughter, a Class VII student, resolving a tiff between her classmates, who were in a relationship according to her.”Another parent, Tushar Singh, said: “My son is in Class VI, but his friendship with senior girls of Class IX-X often scares me.” Singh added: “Once I found love letters in his school diary; I was disturbed. It took me a lot of time to make him understand things and bring his focus back to studies.”Smita Ghosh, a counsellor, said: “Children confess to being in love, but lack clarity about love.” Ghosh said it is crucial to make children understand that attraction is normal and at times hormone-spurred. “But they should not miss their goals,” she said.Dr Prashant Bhimani, a psychologist, said: “If you make your children understand respectful relationship indirectly, they will apply the principle themselves.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063835,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-578405,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/love-like-internet-is-catching-them-young/articleshow/73062389.cms

The accused led forest officials to two more monkeys held captive.

THANE: A 28-year-old man was arrested by Thane forest officials for allegedly capturing and trying to sell three rhesus macaque species of monkeys to local jugglers .

Narendra Muthe, range forest officer, Thane, said they were tipped off about a man planning to sell monkeys to jugglers from Kalwa on Monday night. The officials accordingly laid a trap for him.

The officials were waiting at a designated spot in Kalwa East when they spotted a man carrying a plastic basket loitering in the area in a suspicious manner.

Immediately, the officials intercepted him and on questioning, he broke down and admitted to carrying a monkey in the plastic basket. The man then led the officials to his hideout nearby where he had kept two more monkeys captive to be sold to jugglers at a later date. The animals were rescued by forest officials and kept in their custody. The forest officials registered a case against him and presented him before court that later granted him bail.

“We were informed about a man trying to trade monkeys illegally to jugglers. We laid a trap for him and when we interrogated him, he told us he used to trap monkeys from nearby jungles and then sell them to jugglers in the area for Rs 15,000,” said Muthe.

Forest officials said they will be probing the case further to know if the accused has a history of illegally trading animals and to uncover his network.

The rhesus macaque is a most common species of monkeys and is found across a range of habitats.

A mound of garbage near Science College in Patna on Wednesday.

PATNA: The Patna Municipal Corporation was fourth lowest among the cities having population above 10 lakhs in the Swachh Survekshan results for the first two quarters of 2019-20 announced on Tuesday. None of the urban local bodies (ULBs) in state could make it to the top 1,000 ULBs in the first two quarters under the Swachh Survekshan League.

The results were announced by Union minister of state for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday. The performance of cities in SS League is crucial to their rankings in the annual Swachh Survekshan 2020 as 25% weightage of the quarterly assessments will be included in the annual survey scheduled to be conducted from January 4 to 31.

As per the results announced on Tuesday, the bottom four cities with population above 10 lakh were Patna (ranked 46), Delhi (47), Howrah (48) and Kolkata (49). But technically, Patna was the second last as none of the West Bengal cities participated in the survey and hence scored zero.

Though Sahebganj ULB in Muzaffarpur was the best in state, but it still ranked 1,388, followed by Muzaffarpur and Danapur with 1,457 and 2,723 ranks respectively. An official with the urban development and housing department said the marks will have slight impact on the final survey starting from January 4. “The entire marks for the survey is 6,000, but SS League 2020 consists of only 1,500 marks and that too only 25% of it will be carried forward. Another 1500 marks each will be on the direct observation, citizens’ feedback and service level programme, which will make to total of 4,500,” he said.

“We do not expect much improvement in the final survey as we lack manpower required for the evaluation,” the official added.

State urban development and housing department minister Suresh Kumar Sharma said the department will now focus on improving the ULBs’ rankings in Bihar . “It is our New Year pledge to perform better from now onwards. We have already bought many equipment for cleanliness and the result can be seen from this month,” said Sharma.

Indore: Industries of the state consumed around 17 per cent more electricity in 2018/19 while firms under western region recorded a jump of 22 per cent in power usage as against a year ago led by demand from new units and expansion by existing facilities.

The state supplied 981.1 crore units of electricity to industries having High Tension (HT) connections in 2018/19 of which maximum was consumed under Western Region Power Distribution Company that recorded consumption of 403.4 crore units, showed data from the industry department.

Principal secretary for industry Rajesh Rajora said, “Madhya Pradesh has seen a rise in electricity consumption by industries negating the impact of slowed economy that has affected manufacturing units in the country.”

The increase in electricity consumption is mostly due to demand from new units that have set up facilities in the state while discoms also received proposals for increased usage from already existing units that have undergone expansions.

Under western zone, 165 new HT connections were registered this year while across the state around 302 new units were registered.

Discom MD Vikas Narwal said, “HT connections in western zone constitute about 70 per cent of the total in the state and number of units are regularly going up. We have supplied record number of units this year as demand was high.”

Narwal said, “We are hoping year on year increase in HT consumption looking at the pace of new industries setting up in the region.”

As per discom, besides industries, institutes and establishments also use HT connections and consumption of electricity by all categories of HT users stood at 518 crore units. Last year discom had supplied 413 crore units.

Indore: Like transport department, now Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has a revenue recovery target to chase in current fiscal.

State government has fixed a maximum target of Rs1161 crore for IMC among other civic bodies in state to recover this fiscal through various heads like property tax, water tax, user charges, licence fee and others.

Other civic bodies like Bhopal and Jabalpur also have a revenue recovery target of around Rs700 crore and Rs400 crore to achieve respectively before March 31, 2020.

IMC’s additional commissioner SK Chaitanya said that this is for the first time when civic bodies in state have been given annual revenue recovery targets.

“All civic bodies in state have been given 150 per cent revenue recover target to recover. This includes 50 per cent of the arrear amount and 100 per cent of the current demand amount,” Chaitanya told TOI.

He also said that this target has been set by the government on a logical ground as it would help corporations that are dealing with financial crunch become self-sustainable.

“The amount that we have managed to recover so far is very less as compared to the target set by the government, and we are not sure if we would be able to achieve it. But we still have three months remaining for the closure of the financial year,” he added.

IMC officials and public representatives had been demanding for financial assistance from the state government to ensure proper implementation of development project.

IMC used to get a monthly tax compensation (chungee kshatipoorti) of Rs49 crore from state government which has also been reduced to Rs31 crore for the past four months. And since then, it has become difficult for IMC to manage its monthly expenses such as payment of electricity bills.

The total number of registered property tax accounts in city is 5.41 lakh. In the last financial year, IMC had recovered around Rs418 crore from different heads like property tax, water tax, licence fee, advertisements, building permissions etc. However, this time it has already recovered around Rs422 crore.

Representative image

PATNA: The prevalence of childhood mental disorder is more in Bihar compared to other states in the country. A recent report published in Lancet Psychiatry stated that Bihar and other states falling in the low Socio Demographic Index (SDI) reported more number of mental disorder cases related to children and adolescent. On the other hand, adult mental disorder is prevalent in states with high SDI, the report said.

As per the report, Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) per 1,00,000 population is more in Bihar in the category of autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder which are related to children.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), DALYs for a disease or health condition are calculated as the sum of the Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality in the population and the Years Lost Due to Disability (YLD) for people living with the health condition or its consequences.

Conduct disorder is a condition in which a child becomes hostile or physically violent and may hurt others by pushing or biting during childhood and bullying in adolescence.

Dr Santosh Kumar, associate professor (psychiatry department), Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), said such children are more likely to become anti-social when they grow up.

Dr Kumar said conduct disorder for Bihar was second highest in the country at 117, while the same for Jharkhand stood at 118. DALY in the category of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (a condition in which child is hyperactive and distractive) for Bihar is 5.3 — which is also second highest in the country. DALY for Himachal Pradesh was 39, the least in the country, he added.

Idiopathic developmental intellectual disability (IDID) in Bihar has been calculated to be 252 — highest in the country — followed by Uttar Pradesh at 215. Dr Pramod Kumar Singh, head of psychiatry department, Patna Medical College and Hospital said IDID in simple terms was mental retardation. It can occur due to some post-natal care or poor health infrastructure.

Autism spectrum for Bihar along with nine other states was 54 which was the highest in the country. However in Bihar, life year lost to death or with disability disorder and anxiety disorder have been found to be 406 and 299 respectively — which is less than several southern states. In Tamil Nadu depressive disorders has been found to be 836, with Andhra Pradesh following next with 793.

320,['2/01/2020'],Benefits of core health in everyday life,"Core fitness for many is about having amazingly sculpted abdominal muscles but core strength is much more than that. To achieve the feat of having sculpted abs, one needs to drop the overall body fat percentage, however, this article is not about abs but the importance of core strength in everyday life. Your core muscles are basically the connecting bridge between your upper body and lower body. Though we might not notice but we engage our core muscles in every activity. When we walk, exercise, sit or perform basically any activity, our core is engaged and strengthening our core improves our overall health and wellbeing. Here are a few benefits core health has in our everyday life.Healthy backWeak core muscles increase the risk of back ache and injury. The major reason for this is the lack of spinal support. The total weight of our upper body lies on our spinal cord but if we do not maintain healthy core muscles, we deprive our spine of the necessary support. Healthy core muscles can make a vast difference in the long run. Our bones slightly deteriorate with time and a healthy core might come in handy in such situations.On the job tasksWhen we think about the activities engaging our core muscles, we think of lifting, twisting and standing. Well these are the obvious activities but sitting at your work desk for long durations also engages your core. While sitting for long hours, good posture is a must. If you can’t maintain a good posture while doing activities like typing, computer use and similar activities, your back can get quite stiff. A strong core helps you combat such problems.Good postureA good posture eliminates a lot of problems one might suffer. Exercising your core involves an overall strengthening of muscles and also prevents slouching. Good posture helps reduce the wear and tear of the spine and also allows you to breathe better.Improved athletic performanceAll athletic activities involve some or other kind of movement and our core is engaged for long hours during these activities. A strong core helps you achieve enhanced performance and allows you to be at your best for longer durations.Balance and stabilityOur core provides us the balance and stability we need in our everyday lives. It helps to give a centre of gravity while we are resting or moving our limbs. All the body’s movements originate from the core thus strengthening of core becomes essential to provide balance and stability while doing all such activities.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73046353,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1148604/73046353.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/benefits-of-core-health-in-everyday-life/articleshow/73046353.cms

Sharvari, who penned ‘Turtas Khasgi Avedach’ after her tenth board examination was over, said, “My school life was a sensitive journey of emotions and memories.” She said she shared with her mother the happenings of every day after coming from school.

“Looking at my words and expression of thoughts, my mother once asked me to write my emotional outbursts and also happy moments on a piece of paper. I kept on writing my experiences. Later, I decided to write a book,” she said.

Replying to a question about the fears while penning the book, Sharvari said, “It was difficult to write about me and people around. The book doesn’t revolve only around me but has equal space for important people in my life in school, teachers, best friends and soul mates. Writing this book was an experience in itself as it gave me a chance to revisit memory lane.”

Her book gives an insight into her school life, contains various anecdotes and memories that she experienced as a student and learner. It offers glimpses of her curious mind and how she decided to write it.

Nagpur: Actors showcased their talent in the plays that tackled as varied subjects as comedy, humanity, social issues and modern-day romance in the 59th State Amateur Theatre Competition hosted by Maharashtra state cultural directorate that concluded at Scientific Society Hall on Wednesday.

The contest concluded with the staging of ‘Bharatiya Rangbhoomiche Aadya’. The competition that commenced on November 18 witnessed quality performances, good direction and stage arrangement which gave amateur artistes a chance to excel. Theatre lovers came in large numbers too to watch new dramas which had innovative themes and young actors.

The preliminary round began with the play ‘Manasicha Shilpakar’, written and directed by Parag Ghonge. This was followed by ‘Kishta Bahar’, ‘Te Bara Taas’, ‘Zhalkari’, ‘Hitler Bootpolish Kartoy’, ‘Natakkar Bhadant Ashwaghosh’, ‘Pahila Prem and Propose’, ‘Neki’, ‘Itthal Itthal Love Love’, ‘Up-Down’, ‘ATS’, ‘Nyayapriya’, ‘Biopic Shri’, ‘Varul’, ‘Sattantar’, ‘Wata Palwata’, ‘Nilambari’, ‘Bewaras’, ‘Golmaal’, ‘Sari Raytri’, ‘Ti, Phone Aani Mrutyu’, ‘The Fear Factor’ and ‘Ramjatra’.

Event coordinator Vaidehi Chawre said, “Each play had young actors making a debut. A total of 25 entries were received. This time, the audience got an opportunity to experience a variety of plays. Each play was unique. This year, many talented youngsters participated and people saw them starting their acting career at the competition.”

Pravin Khapre, writer of ‘Biopic Shri’ said, “The credit for successful completion of the monthlong competition goes to actors, writers and directors whose vision to look at issues from a different perspective helped bring out the best in young actors.

“We practised for over a month as most of the artistes were non-Marathi. It was a task to make them understand the lingo and nitty-gritty of the language,” he added.

Writer and director Parag Ghonge was of the opinion that all the plays had good script and direction. Each play carried a message and acting of budding artistes made it a treat to watch.

“Presenting a good play requires a lot of hard work and team efforts. Everybody worked hard to give their best performances. More than the competition, it was an enjoyable process for the audience and actors,” he said.

Rupali Wande, director of the play ‘Pahila Prem and Propose’, was overwhelmed by the response the spectators gave to various dramas and turned up in large numbers to encourage them. She believed the audience enjoyed their play as it had reliability and the power to connect with new-age romance and attraction.

“Our play offered a perfect dose of drama, dance and romance. It was a lighthearted play with a storyline involving college life and the bond of friendship wherein love is an important aspect,” she said.

Director Abhishek Bellarwar chose women empowerment as the theme for his play ‘Neki’. The drama troupe also got reaction of the audience. “We enjoyed our performances. It was the first experience for many actors in the group. We got amazing response from drama lovers. Enthused by the support we got, we are looking forward to the results, to be announced shortly,” he said.

323,['2/01/2020'],"In 3 earlier cases, UP didn’t opt for recovery procedure","This story is from January 2, 2020

LUCKNOW: The recovery procedure initiated against those accused of damaging public and private properties during the recent anti-CAA protests has no precedence in Uttar Pradesh .

While the state has witnessed several cases of group violence in the past decade when public property was damaged, no government invoked the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 or the directives given from time to time by the Supreme Court and the Allahabad high court to make those responsible for damages pay for it.

There have been several protests by farmers for compensation as well as by Jats for job reservation when public property was damaged. Besides, there have been at least three instances since Yogi Adityanath took over as chief minister in March 2017 when public property was damaged during large-scale protests. But the recovery procedure was not initiated in any of these cases.

In April and May 2017, there were violent clashes in Saharanpur between Dalits and Thakurs. While the SSP office was vandalised, a police outpost and a police van were torched in the violence. Besides, around 20 vehicles, including a bus, were set on fire.

Almost a year later, many parts of west UP were affected when ‘ Bharat Bandh ’ backed by BSP on April 2 turned violent. It saw protesters burning a police outpost in Meerut. Besides, half dozen UPSRTC buses, three dozen motorcycles and several police vans were vandalized in the district.

Similarly, a police jeep was torched and a police inspector was killed in Bulandshahr on December 3, 2018. Police named 27 people in the FIR for the murder of the officer and another youth and damages to the public property among other offences. All the accused were arrested and are facing trial, but none of them sent ‘recovery notices’.

“As far as I remember, earlier such recovery notices were not served. That is also because people did not come forward to take claim of their damaged properties. Now that people are coming forward to file claims, we have to recover the money,” said Bijnor DM Ramakant Pandey.

“These recovery notices are being issued only because people are approaching us. The government is not issuing notices for claims on its own but only after people are approaching us,” he added.

Amit Shah and JP Nadda (file photo)

NEW DELHI: BJP president Amit Shah on Wednesday held a crucial meeting with senior party functionaries, including working president JP Nadda, to take stock of the party’s outreach in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and how effectively it can counter the opposition’s campaign against the new law.

The meeting also reviewed the party’s preparations for the upcoming assembly polls in Delhi, sources said.

Apart from Shah and Nadda, general secretary (organisation) B L Santosh and all other general secretaries of the party were present. The party has assigned responsibilities to its office-bearers to lead the campaign in favour of CAA.

Anil Jain is leading party’s charge in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar — the states which have witnessed major protests against CAA. Avinash Rai has been entrusted with leading and coordinating the outreach programme in Chhattisgarh , Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi.

Saroj Pandey has been tasked to coordinate in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Goa and Daman and Diu, while Suresh Bhatt is to lead the programme in Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh and Jammu & Kashmir.

For the southern zone, the party has selected Ravindra Raju who will coordinate outreach programmes in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh , Telangana, Karnataka, the Andamans, Puducherry and Lakshadweep .

For the eastern belt, former Bengal BJP chief Rahul Sinha has been made in-charge of West Bengal , Odisha, Jharkhand and the north-east. He will work in coordination with Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in the northeast.

325,['2/01/2020'],TN writer held for remarks against Modi,"This story is from January 2, 2020

MADURAI: Orator and writer ‘Nellai’ Kannan — who was booked for his provocative speech against Prime Minister Narendra Modi , home minister Amit Shah , Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam at an SDPI meeting in Tirunelveli city on Sunday evening — was arrested in Perambalur district around 8.30pm on Wednesday.

Kannan had allegedly instigated Muslims to “finish off” Modi and Shah.

A senior police officer told TOI that Kannan was arrested by the Tirunelveli city police in a guest house in Perambalur district. The officer said he would be taken to the Trichy government hospital to confirm if he was fit to travel to Tirunelveli, where he would be produced before the judicial magistrate. If doctors say he cannot travel, he will be produced before a judicial magistrate in Trichy. “In either case, we will act on the directions of the magistrate. We will hospitalise him or remand him in jail under judicial custody as they say,” he said.

As Kannan was arrested, BJP workers raised slogans against him while SDPI cadres condemned the arrest. When he was taken out of the guest house, some protesters attempted to throw slippers at him.

On Monday night, the Melapalayam police booked him under IPC sections 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505(i)(b) (intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the state or against public tranquillity) and 505 (ii) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes).

On Tuesday afternoon, Kannan was taken to a private hospital in Tirunelveli as he complained of chest pain. He had to be discharged in an hour as there was a strong protest by BJP cadres on the hospital premises. His family said he would be taken to a hospital in Madurai but maintained confidentiality over the place fearing protest by BJP cadres.

Police said Kannan’s family took him to Madurai on Tuesday and then to Perambalur, where he was arrested due to pressure following the protest by senior BJP functionaries on the Marina on Wednesday evening.

Senior BJP leaders along with 100 party workers were arrested for taking part in the protest on the Marina, demanding the arrest of Kannan.

They had set a 24-hour deadline for the TN Police to arrest Kannan.

NEW DELHI: The Indian armed forces stay far away from politics and work as per orders of the government in office, said the new CDS General Bipin Rawat on Wednesday, in remarks that follow criticism of his comments on leadership and violent anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests.

Congress and other opposition parties have not only criticised Rawat for statements with ‘political overtones’, the latest being his stance against the anti-CAA protests, but also questioned the need to have a CDS. The pivotal reform of the CDS post, incidentally, has been hanging fire since the 1999 Kargil conflict.

Asked about allegations that the armed forces were being politicised after he received a tri-service guard of honour on Wednesday, Rawat said, “We stay away, we stay far away from politics. We work on the directives of the government in power.”

Late last month, as the Army chief, Rawat had slammed people instigating protests in the country against the new citizenship law, saying leadership was not about guiding crowds including students to carry out arson and violence.

The remarks had been sharply criticised by opposition leaders. A large section of serving military officers as well as veterans feel there has been an increasing trend in recent years to needlessly politicise the armed forces, from politicians taking credit for cross-border strikes to UP CM Yogi Adityanath dubbing the Indian Army as ‘Modiji ki Sena’ at a poll rally.

During the Lok Sabha election, PM Modi repeatedly referred to the government’s resolve in ordering the air strike on a madarsa in Balakot in Pakistan known for training terrorists, a deci-sion taken after the jihadi attack on CRPF personnel in Pulwama .

The use of armed forces for building bridges, cleaning waste in high-altitude areas, organising events and other sundry tasks also detracts them from their primary role of preparing for war, conducting counter-terrorism operations and guarding the borders, say veterans.

Most property tax dues from western suburbs

MUMBAI: The BMC has initiated the process to auction Borivli BJP MLA Sunil Rane’s educational institution, Atharva Education Trust at Malad , for defaulting on property tax amounting to Rs 1.2 crore.The property is one of 228 for which the process has been begun by the civic corporation. Assets of several builders are part of the list for non-payment of property tax worth Rs 581 crore. One of the defaulters, Omkar Realtors, owed the BMC Rs 6.7 crore on its Malad property and another Rs 17 crore on its Worli property.All the properties were attached last year, but few had cleared a part of the dues, prompting the civic body to begin the auction process. On Wednesday, BMC officials submitted details of these defaulters to their publicity department in order to get advertisements issued, with details of defaulters so that the properties could be auctioned.Sunil Rane replaced the sitting MLA Vinod Tawde as the BJP candidate from Borivli in the assembly election in October last year and won by a margin of over 95,000 votes, which was the highest in the city. Rane was not available for comment.Among the other defaulters are several builders whom the BMC termed as “habitual defaulters”. A builder’s representative said that the slowdown in the real estate market has impacted them. “Payment of property tax dues is not a priority for several of them,” an official said. Omkar Realtors’ representative told TOI they would settle their dues in the next few days.Most of the property tax dues are from the western suburbs (Rs 255 crore), mainly the Bandra-Malad belt, followed by the eastern suburbs (Rs 192 crore) and the island city (Rs 133 crore).The BMC’s property tax collection has been dropping in the last few years due to defaults and this year, the figures will drop further as the government, as part of its election promises, has decided to exempt flats measuring below 500 sq ft from payment of property tax.Property tax collection is the biggest revenue source for the BMC ever since octroi was abolished. In the last three quarters, property tax collection showed a 19% deficit compared to last year as the BMC had issued no residential bills amid confusion over a waiver policy for homes under 500 sq ft.All collection has been only from commercial establishments, an official said. The municipal body had not issued property tax bills to residential units as it has not calibrated its software and other systems to exclude units under 500 sq ft while generating the bills. The BMC started to issue the bills on flats size measuring more than 500 sq ft only last month.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063207,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-250380,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mlas-school-on-block-for-property-tax-default/articleshow/73063058.cms
329,['2/01/2020'],Sex chat videos leak: Noida top cop says ‘morphed’,"This story is from January 2, 2020

<p>Gautam Buddh Nagar SSP (ANI photo)<br></p>

NOIDA: Vaibhav Krishna, Noida’s young police chief, found himself in the middle of controversy on Wednesday after at least three videos of an alleged sex chat with a woman were leaked online. Krishna, who is senior superintendent of police, described the videos as morphed and part of “an organised attempt to spoil my image”.

The woman isn’t seen in the videos, which are a recording of her phone screen using another device, but the male caller clearly is. Late in the evening, an FIR was registered at Noida’s Sector 20 police station against unknown persons under sections 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act.

Krishna, who addressed a press conference on the issue on Wednesday evening, warned against the videos being forwarded, saying anyone doing so with “malafide intention” would be booked. “It is my appeal that criminal activity should not be supported that way… Everyone has a right to privacy. How can one produce a morphed video?” the SSP said.

Asked about the content of the FIR, Krishna only said there was “conspiracy at work”, leading to morphed videos being circulated. He said the photo in the video was his and he was informed about it by a journalist.

“It seems to be a very big conspiracy, a very big attempt to spoil my image in an organised way,” Krishna said. “About one month back, in some matters related to Gautam Budh Nagar and other districts too, a very sensitive administrative report was sent to the CM’s office on which an investigation is on. Besides, over the last one year, the way action is being taken, many nexuses have been broken, criminals who were not being targeted earlier have been targeted and some very big corruption cases have been lodged. It seems some people were angered by this and resorted to such an act,” he added.

The investigation into the videos will, however, will be transferred to another district. “A probe will be carried out to get to the bottom of this,” Krishna said. “Where it (the video) has been forwarded from, where it originated from, its source will be checked,” he added.

To a question if any politician or government official was named in the report that has been sent to the CM’s office, Krishna declined to comment. The report is sensitive in nature. Investigation is on at the state level,” he said. He, however, confirmed there were names of police officers in the report.

Additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi told TOI on Wednesday evening the videos were fudged. “The officer concerned will lodge an FIR in connection with the incident,” Awasthi said.

The air quality in Mumbai on the first morning of the year was better compared to previous years. (File photo)

MUMBAI: The city this year might have experienced a lower impact of air pollution as concentration of the harmful pollutant PM 2.5 in 2019 was the lowest since 2016, according to an assessment done by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR). The city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) of 175 on January 1 was also the cleanest since 2016.

The city’s annual average for the concentration of particulate matter lesser than 2.5 microns (PM 2.5) was 54 ug/ m3, which is the lowest since 2016 (see box) but continues to breach the permissible limit of 40 ug/m3. “This year the overall concentration of PM 2.5 was lower due to the weather factors including the prolonged monsoon and the cyclones in the Arabian Sea. There has also been more awareness about pollution, and efforts to tackle it that could be showing miniscule results,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.

Track the pollution level in your city

PM 10 and PM 2.5, the major components of outdoor air pollution are under the worst carcinogenics to humans (Group 1). While the concentration of PM 2.5 might have dipped, it’s share in the PM 10 composition increased, according to a SAFAR study presented earlier this month. At the annual Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) conclave, Beig showed that Mumbai had a PM 2.5 to PM 10 ratio of 65% and Delhi 45%.

The air quality in the city on the first morning of the year was better compared to previous years. The quality worsened to 204 by the evening, as predicted by SAFAR. Researchers said the reason for an improved air quality on the new year’s morning was weather patterns. “The winds picked up speed in the last 24 hours, allowing the disbursal of pollutants. The humidity was lower on Tuesday as well, which reduces the pollutant carrying capacity of air. The moisture content increased a little during the day and hence the levels moved to the poor category,” said Beig.

In 2018 and 2017, the city recorded an AQI of 253 and 221 respectively, in the poor category. Among the 10 most monitored locations in the city, Malad was the most polluted at

276. The least polluted was Bhandup with an AQI of 88.

AQI levels for PM 2.5 between 0-50 is good, 51-100 is satisfactory, 101-200 is moderate, 201-300 is poor, 30-400 is very poor and above 400 is severe.

MEERUT: Police on Wednesday morning found the charred body of a 14-year-old boy from Haryana ’s Panipat town, 40km from west UP’s Shamli district where his father — a ‘ bhajan ’ singer — mother and elder sister were found murdered a day ago.

The accused, Himanshu Saini, an aide of ‘bhajan’ singer Ajay Pathak (45), was arrested by Haryana police. According to Panipat police, Saini was arrested when he was trying to flee after setting ablaze Pathak’s SUV which had his son, Bhagwad’s body in the rear seat. Police have sent the charred body for forensic and post-mortem examination.

It all happened a day after Ajay, his wife Sneha Pathak (42) and daughter Vasundhra Pathak (16) were murdered with a sharp-edged weapon at their Shamli house. Police said during interrogation, Himanshu confessed to have killed the entire family for not returning Rs 60,000 they owed to him. Himanshu alleged that he was insulted by Ajay every time he asked for his money.

During interrogation, the accused confessed to have killed the family with “one of the many swords which were kept at their home”.

Shamli SP Vineet Jaiswal said, “Himanshu had dinner with the family on Monday night, and decided to kill them after he was allegedly humiliated by Ajay for asking for his money.”

“After dinner, as the family was sleeping, he first went to Ajay’s room and attacked him and his wife Sneha with a sword. Then he went to Vasundhra’s room and killed her. He then strangulated 14-year-old Bhagwad to death,” said SP Jaiswal. Police said Himanshu planned to dispose all the bodies. He first took Bhagwad’s body to Panipat. “But, when he got to know that the news of the murders has spread, he set the car on fire,” said Jaiswal.

GURUGRAM: If you’re planning to invest in premium housing in Gurugram , the new year hasn’t brought good tidings.The Gurugram administration on Monday proposed higher circle rates, which decide how much you pay during registration of properties, in the city. The steepest hikes — more than double the existing rate — will affect those investing in upscale condominiums along Golf Course Road, such as Parsvnath Exotica, The Verandas, Palm Springs, Park Place, Belaire, Camellias, Vipul Belmonte and Central Park, and in DLF 5. In most of these areas, the circle rate may see an increase from the existing Rs 8,000 per sq ft to a maximum of Rs 17,000 per sq ft.The administration has invited objections and suggestions from residents till January 10, following which the circle rates will be finalised and notified.Circle rate is the minimum price at which a property is transferred in government records. Since the government collects stamp duty on the basis of the circle rate, it’s at the registration stage that a buyer will have to cough up a higher amount. So, if a buyer purchases a 4,000 sqft apartment at the current circle rate of Rs 8,000 per sq ft, the total cost comes out to be Rs 3.2 crore. If stamp duty of 7% is levied on the cost, that’s Rs 22 lakh. If the circle rate is hiked to Rs 17,000 per sq ft, the assumed cost of this flat will double, as will stamp duty.Property experts said this would have a negative impact on luxury real estate transactions. The circle rate proposed for group housing societies in Gwal Pahari has also been doubled from the existing Rs 3,000 per sq ft to Rs 7,000 per sq ft. The proposed circle rate for the group housing societies in Sector 15, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32A, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 46, 50, 51, 52 , 53, 54, 55, 56 and 57 is also more than double, from the existing Rs 5,000 per sq feet to Rs 12,000 per sq feet.“The circle rate for Huda builder floors and floors in the licensed colonies has been proposed to hike from the existing Rs 5,500 per sq ft to Rs 10,000 per sq ft.

The roads were jam-packed with vehicles but that didn’t deter mana Hyderabadis from partying it out, even if it meant getting stranded in traffic for a good one hour.

336,['2/01/2020'],P. V. Sindhu: ‘Winning the Olympic gold for India will be a great way to herald the new decade’,"From the looks of it, 2020 promises to be a year of reckoning for Pusarla Venkata Sindhu. She has come a long way from being that lanky Hyderabad girl who took everybody by surprise by winning the silver medal at the Rio Olympics back in 2016. This time Sindhu enters the Tokyo Olympics as the reigning world champion. And the 24-year-old knows that all of India will be cheering for her to become first Indian shuttler to win an Olympic gold medal when the 2020 Summer Olympics kicks off in July. “It’s a huge responsibility. Wherever I go, people are speaking about an Olympic medal. I hope I can live up to the expectations people have of me,” says Sindhu, as she settles down for a chat with Hyderabad Times. Excerpts:Yes, I can’t believe it’s 2020 already. The last decade was really good for me and I feel I grew from strength to strength as a player. The biggest high, of course, was winning the gold medal at the World Championships in Basel last year. More than anything else, it is all the love I’ve received from the people of India that has been overwhelming. It feels great to be entering the new decade as the reigning World Champion. I hope I can carry the winning momentum into this decade too and win many more medals for India. Winning the Olympic gold for India will be a great way to herald the new decade.They are going very well; I’m training hard with Gopi sir and Park Tae Sang. I’m back on tour from January 2 itself and will start the year with Malaysia Masters which will begin on January 7. The preparation leading up to Tokyo will be intense. The Olympic qualifiers are also coming up soon so all the focus is on that, everything else will take a backseat.It’s going to be a lot different compared to Rio, because the players are different and the game has evolved so much since. So the strategies are going to be different too. Last time, I was just a promising player going into the Olympics, but this time, I’m the reigning World Champion and the Olympic silver medalist, so expectations are bound to be much higher as people expect a medal from me. That is a huge responsibility and it motivates me to push harder and give my best on court, and hopefully, win the elusive Olympic gold medal for India.Well, I actually enjoyed the tremendous reception I got. It was a much-awaited win and it’s something very important for me. I already had two bronze and two silver medals and I badly wanted the gold. I knew I needed to be on top of my game. It was a great week for me in Basel and I’ve made some priceless memories. Yes, the adulation got a bit overwhelming at times, but I really enjoy it. It’s always nice to see so many people come to me, ask for autographs and selfies. I feel like a real star, and that’s a great feeling. Talking about my performance, yes there were a few ups and downs.In sport, you win some and lose some. But the important thing is to believe in yourself. After the World Championships, I had hit a rough patch where I lost in the first round and pre-quarterfinals in several tournaments. But I didn’t let that bog me down. I always learn from my mistakes, and I think that’s very important.The best way to answer critics is to give your best each time you step on to the court, and that’s what I plan to do. In sport, there are always wins and losses and the only thing I can control is how I play my game. I think it’s important to pick and choose your tournaments as a player, so that you can give your 100 per cent all the time. Because while playing tournaments are important, it’s equally important to stay fit.Yes, everything is fine. There’s nothing to worry about (laughs). I try to strike a balance between skill and endurance in my training. Sometimes, there will be long matches and you get tired, so that’s when you have to find the strength from within to pull through. My fitness regime consists of weight training to improve strength, and a lot of running agility drills to build my endurance and movement on the court.Apart from badminton, fashion is one thing that I really love. It helps take my mind off the game for a while. I enjoy the process of picking an outfit, putting onmake-up and prettying up to go for an event. I really like to dress up, that’s for sure. No matter how tired I’m, I will never step out not feeling good about the way I look. I’m very particular about that. And my look depends on where I go. My fashion funda is to be myself and I like to wear clothes that suit me and in which I feel comfortable.Well, I have a team of stylists but ultimately, I have the final say. Only if I’m fully comfortable and satisfied with my look, will I wear it. As a sportsperson, comfort is most important when it comes to clothes. If your clothes aren’t comfortable, you won’t wear it on the court right? The same applies for me while choosing other outfits as well. But when I dress up, I don’t think I’m a sportsperson. I’m just a girl who wants to look good.At home, I just spend time with my family. My parents are there for me and they motivate me all the time. As they too were sportspersons, they understand the challenges I face. I’m very thankful to them for their support. I also love spending time with my one-and-a-half-year-old nephew, Aryan. We watch movies together and do little fun things. He’s my biggest stressbuster. I love travelling too. Although my overseas trips are usually packed with training and tournaments, I sometimes do take time off to explore the place. Last year, I went to Switzerland and it’s my favourite place by far. Italy and Greece are my dream destinations and hopefully I will get to visit those places in 2020. Obviously, it’s a busy year with the Olympics. Maybe if I win in Tokyo, I’ll go there to celebrate (laughs).",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73058059,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-84520/73058059.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/telugu/movies/news/winning-the-olympic-gold-for-india-will-be-a-great-way-to-herald-the-new-decade/articleshow/73058059.cms

Dhanush’s character in Asuran simply blew my mind. It’s such a brooding, psyched out character, something I’ve never seen in Telugu cinema. Set in the 1980s, the film is very raw and intense,” says the actor, who is reuniting with director Srikanth Addala for the movie again after Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu . Talking about his character, Venky goes on to add, “He is like an asuran (demon). His behaviour and expressions and emotions are intense all through. A father of two kids, he goes around killing people to get his revenge. Dhanush did a fabulous job and I knew playing a character like that is going to be a challenge for me.” Venky also confirms that F2 – Fun and Frustration sequel is on the cards. “When we were doing F2 – Fun and Frustration, I was sure that it will make for a great comedy franchise. I have already had a few script discussions with Varun (Tej) and Anil Ravipudi (director). Once we lock in on the plotline, we’ll announce F3.

338,['2/01/2020'],Centre rejects Bengal’s R-Day tableau on girls scheme,"This story is from January 2, 2020

NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: West Bengal ’s tableau proposal for this year’s Republic Day parade has been rejected, the defence ministry said on Wednesday.

“The tableau proposal of the government of West Bengal was examined by the expert committee in two rounds of meetings. The proposal was not taken forward for further consideration by the expert committee after deliberations in the second meeting,” a statement from the ministry said.

Bengal was planning to showcase its social welfare project, Kanyashree, on direct cash-transfer for girls that has received international recognition. Bengal officials weren’t invited to two successive meetings convened by the defence ministry’s expert committee to decide on tableau specifications, state government officials said.

This is the second time since 2015 that Bengal’s proposal to showcase Kanyashree at the Republic Day parade has run into rough weather. There was a hitch in 2018 as well, when the state government wanted to make ‘Ekata-i Sampriti’ (unity is brotherhood) the central theme of its tableau. The state went unrepresented at the parade in both years.

It is pertinent to mention that Bengal government’s tableau was shortlisted for participation in Republic Day Parade 2019 as an outcome of the same process. In recent past, Bengal won the first prize in 2014 for a tableau showcasing Chhau dance and in 2016 for its presentation on Baul artistes.

Twenty-two proposals — 16 from states and UTs and six from central ministries — out of a total 56 were short-listed for this year’s parade.

339,['2/01/2020'],Fast food on wheels set for a comeback in Delhi,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Food trucks dishing out delicacies on the streets are a common feature across the world. However, while this fast food culture has gained popularity in the past decade in satellite towns like Gurgaon and Noida, its growth has been stagnant in Delhi.The scenario, however, is set to change as the city is likely to get more roadside joints in the next few months after a gap of 12 years. While the unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi had stopped issuing new licences for food trucks in 2008 as they were leading to traffic congestion and unhygienic conditions, the deliberative wing of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has decided to restart the process.Food trucks were banned in 2008 after a ruckus in North Campus of Delhi University.Kamaljeet Sehrawat, leader of the House in SDMC, said that the process for creating new regulations had been started and licences would be issued after the assembly elections as the model code of conduct is soon expected to come in force. “We will modify the conditions to address the concerns of traffic congestion. We will regularise the food trucks running in violation of norms. In any case, they are active for just 4-5 hours a day,” she added.“Safety norms and traffic concerns will not be compromised. We will review the problems that were faced in 2008 and find a solution. Gurgaon and Noida have already amended their policies to facilitate food trucks,” Sehrawat said.The civic body’s medical relief and public health committee has asked the public health department to reframe rules and start issuing licences. A senior public health official said that apart from permission from the land-owning agency, food trucks have to get a no objection certificate from Delhi Traffic Police to operate.SDMC data shows only around 60 food truck licences are currently valid in areas under its jurisdiction. While west zone has 16 licensees, Najafgarh has 11, south 13 and central 20. Given the low cost, many beginner restaurateurs opt to open food trucks.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063136,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-133760,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fast-food-on-wheels-set-for-a-comeback-in-delhi/articleshow/73063133.cms
340,['2/01/2020'],"Tree count up 11 lakh in decade, says BMC; activists sceptical of claim","File photo of Aarey Colony

The decade just ended was one in which Mumbaikars went to battle for green cover, as infrastructure projects threatened thousands of trees across the city, especially in the forested Aarey Colony. This was also a decade, according to the official tree census, when the number of trees in the city rose substantially—that is, if you believe the data.Completed in 2018, the census findings were not made public till recently, and met with scepticism. The count pegged the number of trees in Mumbai at 29.75 lakh—10 lakh more than the last census, done in 2008. But almost half of that increase was due to the inclusion of Aarey Colony, which was not part of the last count. Even what remained of the increase seemed at odds with what residents and activists were seeing on the ground: the incessant lopping of trunks for building road and rail, and for redeveloping buildings.Activist Zoru Bhathena said he found the 2018 data unconvincing. “While the BMC through the census had planned to give each tree a unique identification number, this was never done. Nor was any data provided on the BMC’s website,” he said. “Moreover, no one I know saw any officials coming to their neighbourhood for the tree census.”BMC officials say the census data is part of the civic environment report 2018-19. The greenest wards were the ones enclosing the suburbs of Ghatkopar , Malad , Andheri, Vile Parle, Jogeshwari, Vikhroli and Bhandup, some of which are on the periphery of the national park and the Aarey tracts. The least green wards are in south Mumbai, with the Pydhonie-Dhobi Talao area having barely 6,000 trees, and the Dongri-Umarkhadi stretch just about 8,000. It must be mentioned that the areas of the BMC’s administrative wards vary widely.However, census methods have been questioned by experts. Suchandra Dutta, assistant professor of the department of botany , RD National College, Bandra, said the census did not seem to cover educational campuses, many of which have a large number of old trees. “Some historical trees may have been missed out by the census. There is a need to look into this once again,” he said.Others question the delay between the two censuses. The Maharashtra Protection and Preservation of Trees Act 1975 mandates a tree census every five years, noted former BMC tree committee member Niranjan Shetty. “Yet another question is on why certain areas were left out in earlier censuses, especially government land or Aarey Colony,” said Shetty.BMC started the latest tree census in February 2015 from Raj Bhavan, Malabar Hill , finishing only in 2018, at a cost of Rs 3 crore. It was the first time that Geographic Information system (GIS) was used for the exercise.“One reason it doesn’t feel like that the tree cover is increasing,” suggested Dutta, “is that while tree planting efforts have increased, maintenance of those trees is poor.”Ashok Kothari, president of National Society of the Friends of Trees, said BMC has stopped planting trees on pavements. “Instead, space is made for allowing cables to be placed. It could be that some sincere efforts are being made, but there is a need for much more to be done,” he said.Civic officials said they aim to plant 20,000 trees this year. And in yet another bid to increase green cover, BMC has announced plans to develop 100 plots using a Japanese technique of quick afforestation. Will these grand plans help resolve Mumbai’s escalating tree wars?",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063140,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-541560,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tree-count-up-11-lakh-in-decade-says-bmc-activists-sceptical-of-claim/articleshow/73063125.cms

NEW DELHI: At 437, the Air Quality Index in the capital on Wednesday dipped to the ‘severe’ category from Tuesday’s very poor. Long traffic snarls on Tuesday evening and the fireworks post midnight could have added to the deterioration, the agencies said, adding that the meteorological conditions were favourable for pollution on Wednesday.Track the pollution level in your cityThe forecast for the next two days show that the influence of increased surface winds due to an active western disturbance on the air quality is likely to increase. The SAFAR model suggests that, under the influence of approaching western disturbance, increased surface winds and improved ventilation, the AQI is expected to improve to the higher-end of the ‘very poor’ category by January 2.“An additional source of emission through a number of sources like fireworks and vehicles in all likelihood has increased emission levels last night from 8pm onwards, which peaked at midnight to 1am. This has lead to a sudden deterioration in AQI,” said SAFAR.It added that despite high wind speed, a domination of emissions over surface wind has been the driving factor this winter, which has caused the sudden variations in the air quality. Met officials said the wind speed on Wednesday was around 15 km/hr, which was good for the dispersal of pollutants and should increase to 20-25 km/ hr on Thursday, along with a spell of very light rain. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, however, warned that with a drizzle, chances of pollution levels increasing again would be high.In Video: Air quality 'severe' amidst cold wave in Delhi",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063143,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-340357,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/severe-air-back-in-delhi-light-rain-likely-to-occur-today/articleshow/73063141.cms

370,['2/01/2020'],Free WiFi in Delhi Metro: High-speed Wi-Fi for free on Delhi Metro's Airport Express Line,"This story is from January 2, 2020

There will be no limitations on download speed or traffic volume (File photo)

NEW DELHI: From Thursday, commuters travelling by Delhi Metro ’s high-speed Airport Express Line will also be able to enjoy free highspeed Wi-Fi services inside the trains.

It will be the first Delhi Metro corridor to have Wi-Fi on-board moving trains and similar services are expected on other corridors in the future.

In July, TOI was the first to report that Airport Express Line will have Wi-Fi onboard in moving trains. The six stations of the high-speed Airport Express Line were the first to provide Wi-Fi connectivity to commuters, in 2016. Next year, Delhi Metro’s Blue Line (Dwarka-Noida City Centre/Vaishali) became the second metro corridor to provide free Wi-Fi facility to its passengers at all the 50 stations of the corridor.

The free Wi-Fi facility in Airport Express Line trains will be launched by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s managing director Mangu Singh on Thursday.

According to DMRC officials, the service in Delhi metro will be provided for free and without any limitations on download speed or traffic volume. The target speed will reach up to 300 Mbps per train, they said.

The mechanism through which commuters will be able to access Wi-Fi on-board moving trains will be a two-level network. Firstly, it is a train-to-tunnel (T2T) radio network, which passes signal from base stations inside a tunnel to portable base stations inside head cars. Secondly, the inner-train network that will transmit signal from the Wireless Access Points (WAP) in each car to users’ devices.

According to sources in DMRC, the corporation is planning to deploy a Wi-Fi network at all its corridors, except the Magenta (Janakpuri West-Botanical Garden) and Pink (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) Lines.

Stations on the Blue Line, the busiest corridor of Delhi metro network, started providing Wi-Fi facility three years ago. The facility, named “Oui DMRC Free Wi-Fi” is available at all the 50 stations of the Blue Line. Commuters can log in by searching for Wi-Fi options and log into “Oui DMRC Free Wi-Fi” after doing a onetime registration through their mobile phones.

For providing this free Wi-Fi facility, DMRC has tied up with a consortium which is already providing the same facility on all six metro stations of the Airport Express Line from October 2016 and also running India’s first Wi-Fi on train service on the Delhi-Howrah Rajdhani Express.

5 metro stations closed to keep crowd in check

NEW DELHI: More than 5.5 lakh New Year revellers, many from other parts of NCR, descended on popular destinations in the capital, causing monster traffic jams in several parts of the city on Wednesday. The massive inflow of people, estimated to be 30% higher than the New Year Day of 2019, prompted police to shut five Metro stations, adding to the woes of commuters.India Gate alone saw footfalls of nearly 3 lakh, police estimated. Visitors also thronged Connaught Place, Delhi zoo, Waste to Wonder Park, the “mall mile” on Press Enclave Road, Akshardham Temple, Bangla Sahib Gurdwara and the Hanuman Temple at Jamuna Bazar.The massive turnout, on a sunny day when temperatures touched a 20-day high, choked almost all arterial roads in east, central and south Delhi for nearly six hours. It followed a bitterly cold morning, when the minimum temperature, at 2.4 degrees C, was the lowest in January in seven years.The crowds were several times more than what police had expected. As the crowds kept swelling, the cops shut down five Metro stations — closing the entry and exit gates of Central Secretariat, Udyog Bhawan, Pragati Maidan, Khan Market and Mandi House stations — to prevent more people from pouring in.The crowd started swelling from 1pm as weather conditions. People heading to the zoo or India Gate caused choke points on Mathura Road as cops had to intermittently stop vehicles to allow pedestrians to cross the road. Apart from this, huge crowds also gathered at the Connaught Place Hanuman temple and Akshardham temple to offer prayers on the first day of the year, leading to major disruptions.The Waste to Wonder Park, which was inaugurated in February 2019, sold 11,000 tickets, its highest for a single day.Visitors had come from as far as Alwar to spend New Year Day in the capital. “I reached Delhi on train as my children wanted to see the National War Memorial. I did not expect such a huge crowd here. We could not enter the war memorial but enjoyed at the India Gate,” said Rama Kanth, a former athlete.Police had deployed 40 teams around the India Gate alone to control the movement of around 70-80 thousand people around afternoon, which soared to a total of three lakh through the day. Police officers say that the crowd suddenly started swelling around 2pm. Even though the cops tried to streamline the movement of the crowd especially around Rajpath and children’s park, the sheer volumes were almost impossible to manage.This choked Chexagon, Mathura Road (near Bapa Nagar) and Ring Road. Almost all roads, from Sarai Kale Khan to Lodhi Colony, became jammed due to the ripple effect of the mayhem. Adding to this, was the crowd at Delhi Zoo and Waste to Wonder Park. Even though the roads around both these places are no-parking zones, visitors parked their vehicles on the stretch, blocking a lane. Amid a maddening craze for selfies with India Gate as the background, nearly the entire road in front of the monument was occupied by visitors.“We had put out a diversion plan that helped us in managing the crowd. Vehicle movement never came to a standstill in any of these areas due to this,” said a police officer.According to an estimate, more than three lakh people had travelled to Delhi from NCR using the newly opened Metro lines and blocked the way for vehicle movements. Press Enclave Road in south Delhi too was teeming with people as revellers thronged the malls there. The police had to stop traffic at intervals to allow pedestrians to cross over. Auto-rickshaws and cabs stopped to pick up passengers, adding to the snarls.Police officers said they sought help from local police to control the crowds. “We could not risk a situation where we could allow pedestrians and vehicles to move at the same time. It would have sparked a law and order problem,” said a senior police officer.“I had presumed that travelling on Barapullah to reach Sarai Kale Khan and then taking Ring Road would be relatively smooth but the snarls on Barapullah stretched on for hours, after which there was a huge jam at India Gate. It took me nearly two hours to cross the stretch,” said Anshul Kalra, heading for Bangla Sahib Gurdwara from south Delhi.At Connaught Place, cops disallowed parking in the Outer Circle after traffic nearly came to a standstill around 5pm. Around the same time, more than 5,000 people had lined up along the road to enter Hanuman temple that blocked one carriageway of Baba Kharak Singh Marg. Police officers say that the situation became better around 8pm when the crowd started dispersing.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063212,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-256360,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/5-5-lakh-revellers-flood-delhi-spots-as-temperatures-touches-20-day-high/articleshow/73063061.cms

A brief spell of rain flooded the Nungambakkam vehicular subway on Wednesday.

CHENNAI: In one of the more intense spells of rain in the past few weeks, the city received 1.78cm and the suburbs got 2.83cm of rain on Wednesday. Weathermen have forecast similar spells in the coming days.

The Met department said the sky is likely to be generally cloudy. ‘Light to moderate rain is likely to occur in some areas,” it said. Most parts of the city and its suburbs got a quick and heavy spell of rain early on Wednesday morning. A Met department official said the monsoon has extended and weather conditions continue to be conducive for rain.

Private weather blogger Pradeep John, in a social media post, said: “Chennai January normal rains is 26mm and we have got that rain on the first day itself. The last time Chennai got new year rain is on 2012, but the quantum was not so high.” He added: “On and off rains (and) small spells will be there till January 9 after which rains will reduce.”

374,['2/01/2020'],"Retail demand for cars, SUVs positive from Sept-Nov ‘19","File photo

CHENNAI: Riding on heavy discounts particularly for BS4 models, retail sales of cars and SUVs have shown an increase for three consecutive months. According to the Vahan vehicle registration data shared by the government, passenger vehicle registrations were up 6.25% in November, 14% in October and 8% in September (see chart). This three-month on-the-trot sales increase comes after five months of continuous sales slump (see chart). The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), the industry apex body for auto dealers, says December too should see positive retail numbers for passenger vehicles though the bloodbath continues for the trucks and buses segment.“In December, dealers are expecting a small increase in sales. October saw positive retail due to festival demand, November the trend continued as the discounts continued and December too should see some uptick. The inventory levels are now very normal at 4 weeks countrywide and around 3 weeks in some markets and the liquidity situation is also improving with banks increasing their working capital and other financing,” said FADA president Ashish Harsharaj Kale. What has helped the situation, he added, are planned production cuts by car companies in the run up to the BS6 shift.“What’s happening is less a turnaround than a bottoming out with passenger vehicle numbers looking stronger month-on-month. The used car trade has also been quite active which is another indicator,” explained Kumar Kandaswami, partner, Deloitte.Used car marketers agree that the sector has been both strong demand and supply right through calendar 2019. “We were expecting a slightly softer December compared to October and November but used vehicle sales continue to be strong,” said Droom founder-CEO Sandeep Aggarwal. Online marketplace Droom, he said, sold used vehicles worth Rs 636 crore in October and Rs 604 crore in November and is looking to close December with around Rs 625 crore worth of business.The total passenger vehicle market (used and new) is currently 9 million units strong (used 5 million units, new 4 million units) and worth $77 billion (new $39 billion and used $38 billion).Auto financiers however say that December retails of some OEMS could be impacted by the production cuts taken to clean up the BS4 stocks. “December has seen some supply issues with a few OEMs that have been discontinuing their BS4 models. The aggressive discounting means customers are interested but in many markets they are not getting the model, variant, colour or powertrain of their choice,” said Vyomesh Kapasi, MD, Kotak Mahindra Prime.",auto,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063230,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1335635,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/cars/retail-demand-for-cars-suvs-positive-from-sept-nov-19/articleshow/73063236.cms
375,['2/01/2020'],Car sales dip most in two decades in 2019,"(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: Indian auto industry wrapped up one of its most difficult periods in the year 2019 as sales of cars and SUVs went into a free fall, witnessing the biggest decline in over two decades as rising uncertainties, difficult financing, and the economic slump kept buyers away despite heavy discounts. Such had been the pressure that the numbers fell despite the entry of new brands such as Kia Motors and MG Motors, which surprisingly managed a strong opening even in a difficult market.According to numbers sourced from the industry, sales of passenger vehicles — a cumulative of cars, vans and SUVs — fell below the psychological 3-million mark in 2019, after crossing the figure for the first time in 2017. The decline was led by the top brands that included Maruti Suzuki , Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, Honda and Toyota .The recipe for slowdown has been in the making since the middle of 2018 when numbers had actually started falling. The declines began to get deeper, and sharper, in the coming months and rather got more pronounced in 2019 as economic growth came under pressure and political uncertainties, with relation to the national elections, started growing. And, as liquidity pressures started mounting after the NBFC crisis and issues such as unemployment became severe, the industry started collapsing. Adding to the conundrum was the confusion around the migration to BS6 emission regime from April 2020 from the existing BS4.“It had been a tough year, but now we look forward to the New Year with optimism,” Shashank Srivastava, director (marketing & sales) at Maruti Suzuki , told TOI.

NEW DELHI: Indian auto industry wrapped up one of its most difficult periods in the year 2019 as sales of cars and SUVs went into a free fall, witnessing the biggest decline in over two decades as rising uncertainties, difficult financing, and the economic slump kept buyers away despite heavy discounts. Such had been the pressure that the numbers fell despite the entry of new brands such as Kia Motors and MG Motors, which surprisingly managed a strong opening even in a difficult market.According to numbers sourced from the industry, sales of passenger vehicles — a cumulative of cars, vans and SUVs — fell below the psychological 3-million mark in 2019, after crossing the figure for the first time in 2017. The decline was led by the top brands that included Maruti Suzuki , Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, Honda and Toyota The recipe for slowdown has been in the making since the middle of 2018 when numbers had actually started falling. The declines began to get deeper, and sharper, in the coming months and rather got more pronounced in 2019 as economic growth came under pressure and political uncertainties, with relation to the national elections, started growing. And, as liquidity pressures started mounting after the NBFC crisis and issues such as unemployment became severe, the industry started collapsing. Adding to the conundrum was the confusion around the migration to BS6 emission regime from April 2020 from the existing BS4.“It had been a tough year, but now we look forward to the New Year with optimism,” Shashank Srivastava, director (marketing & sales) at Maruti Suzuki , told TOI. Maruti — which also flags rising vehicle prices as a depressant — was able to hold on to its 50% share of the market, but feels that the industry still remains “cautiously optimistic”.

377,['2/01/2020'],Eight die on New Year's Eve in Chennai and Kancheepuram,"This story is from January 2, 2020

A sea of revellers clicking photographs and selfies at Marina beach on Tuesday night.

At least eight people, including a lawyer and a college student, died in separate accidents on the city’s outskirts and in Kancheepuram on Tuesday night and in the early hours of Wednesday when the New Year revelry was at its peak. Police, however, said they were not able to confirm if any of the accidents were directly related to the celebrations.

While hotels and clubs were packed and there were thousands of people on the roads through the night, the biggest party spots, like always, were the Marina and the Elliot’s beach in Besant Nagar. About 15,000 police personnel were deployed across the city and about 75 flyovers were blocked for vehicles from 10pm on Tuesday. There were few untoward incidents.

S Thangavelu, a 20-yearold third year BCom student of a private college and resident of New Perungalathur , died after he rode his two-wheeler into a bus parked by the side of a road near Tambaram. His two friends, who were riding pillion, escaped with injuries. Police said all the three were not wearing helmets. Thangavelu was rushed to the Government Hospital in Chromepet where doctors declared him ‘brought dead’.

Roads in the suburbs were full of merrymakers, either going to events or returning from parties. Ramalingam, a 40-yearold lawyer practising in the Madras high court, was returning home on his two-wheeler after celebrating with friends when he was run over by a truck near Puzhal Central Prison. He died on the spot.

At Irungattukottai on Chennai-Bengaluru National Highway, a car rammed against a lorry, killing two and leaving four others injured. The deceased, who police identified as Kancheepuram residents Vignesh Sha, 24, and Sankar Sha, 26, had celebrated with four others at Kancheepuram and all six were driving to a party in Chennai when the incident occurred.

Near Ennore, Sundar, 48, a fisherman, died after his twowheeler collided with another two-wheeler. The other biker is being treated at a government hospital. While Mohammad, 45, of Porur, who was riding a bicycle, was knocked down by an autorickshaw near Kumanan Chavadi and died on the way to hospital, an unknown vehicle fatally knocked down Krishnakumar, 31, a motorcycle rider, at the Red Hills-Kathirvedu traffic signal.

Rajagopal, a 70-year-old pedestrian, was fatally knocked down by an autorickshaw at Karayanchavadi near Poonamallee on Wednesday morning.

LED-illuminated barricades were put up on arterial roads, particularly Kamarajar Salai, Dr Radhakrishnan Salai, Sardar Patel Road, Anna Salai and Poonamallee High Road, and special teams were deployed on ECR at Neelankarai, Thoraipakkam, Thiruvanmiyur, Outer Ring Road, Maduravoyal Bypass, GST Road and GNT Road to check ‘racing’. Help centres were set up at many places and 25 patrol vehicles were on the roads to help clear crowds and traffic.

380,['2/01/2020'],GST evasion: GST evaders set to face stricter scans,"(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: Goods and services tax ( GST ) authorities are going to seek bank account details of businesses to tally with their filings, apart from initiating other measures, as part of fresh efforts to tighten the noose around evaders or those misusing and gaming the system.The revenue department will meet officials from central and state GST wings as well as the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and the Central Board of Direct Taxes next. The idea is to improve upon the red flags, which have helped the government improve compliance, resulting in filing of the GSTR-3B forms rising over 12% to 81 lakh returns by the December 20 deadline.“Through e-way bills and FASTag, we will be able to check if goods have actually moved. Data from banks will help us check if genuine transactions have taken place or bogus details have been filled up in the returns,” an officer told TOI.Weak compliance, which resulted in less than 70 lakh returns being filed by the deadline just over a year ago, was seen to be one of the reasons for leakages. But over the last few months, the revenue department has started detailed data analysis helping nab those who were under-reporting sales or were claiming excess refund of input tax credit.The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) along with GST Network, the agency providing the technology backbone, have devised what are commonly referred to as “red flags” that typically add up to around 40,000 a month in a tax base of over one crore. There are four-five parameters based on which alerts are sent out, with key focus being on the two GST returns that are filed.So, there is a “nudge” and a push in case the data in GSTR-1 does not tally with GSTR-3B. If the gap is around Rs 1 lakh, text messages are automatically sent to the company’s directors or the proprietor of a firm, asking them to look into the difference. Officials said, in a lot of cases, this itself is enough to get the entity to “rectify” the problem, which may have been due to oversight.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063304,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-523255,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gst-evaders-set-to-face-stricter-scans/articleshow/73063308.cms

Corporation officials said some smaller establishments were still using plastics.

CHENNAI: The corporation seized more than 320 tonnes of banned plastic in 2019 from various establishments including manufacturers and wholesale dealers. However, small establishments continue to use plastic bags, which the civic body is confident of phasing out this year.

Plastic ban was enforced in the state since the beginning of 2019. An estimated ₹90 lakh has been collected as fine so far, say officials. While enforcement drive was in full swing in the initial months, monsoon preparedness and other civic infrastructure works put plastic raids on the backseat in the latter end of the year, say officials. Of the total amount of plastic seized, a little over ten tonnes was seized in the past three months. Officials said that while raids are carried out from time to time, only the smaller establishments are found using plastic bags, which they had stocked and hence the seizure seems smaller.

Three weeks ago, extensive raids were conducted in Valasaravakkam Zone (Zone 11), in Nolambur , Poonamalee High Road, Kundrathur Main Road, Porur. As many as 155 establishments- eateries, department stores, street side vendors were surveyed and 10 kg of plastic was seized from about 14 establishments.

A footwear showroom on Kundrathur Main Road, Porur, which was found using banned plastic, was sealed by the authorities.

In all 15 zones in the city, over 3.6 lakh premises have been raided till December 2019, officials said. The highest amount of fine collected is ₹14.9 lakh in Royapuram (Zone 5).

386,['2/01/2020'],Karnataka: Caste quota poses headache for BJP,"This story is from January 2, 2020

BJP

BENGALURU: Renewed demands for higher reservation in education and employment for Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribes pose a major headache for BJP ahead of the cabinet expansion.

The issue could give opponents and even disgruntled politicians in the saffron camp ammunition to question BJP’s efforts towards social justice, even as the party tries to shore up its electoral prospects by rebuilding Lingayat-SC/ST alliance in Karnataka.

ST legislators, led by health minister B Sriramulu, have already ramped up pressure on chief minister BS Yediyurappa, threatening to resign en masse if the government doesn’t consider the requests to enhance ST reservation from 3% to 7.5%. SCs have been demanding that their quota be hiked from 15% to 17.5%.

The previous Congress-JD(S) government constituted a commission to look into the demands and asked it to submit a report before December 31, 2019. The commission, headed by justice Nagamohan Das, has now sought time till June to complete its study, much to the annoyance of the Yediyurappa government, which wants to resolve the issue sooner. Panel members said they could not focus on the task because of political stability in the state earlier.

The BJP government has granted an extension, which has further angered ST legislators. “We understand that the commission faced logistical issues during the transition from the coalition government and BJP government, but a delay of six months is not acceptable. We request the commission to speed up the work and submit the report before January 15,” said Sriramulu, who is at the forefront of the quota enhancement campaign.

Yediyurappa faces another problem: there are calls to make Sriramulu and Ramesh Jarkoholi deputy chief ministers. He already has three deputies. Both Sriramulu and Jarkoholi are looking to emerge as undisputable voices of the Valmiki community by bagging the post and leading the quota movement.

The government also faces pressure from religious heads. Valmiki Prasannnanda Swami, the pontiff of Valmiki Peetha in Davanagere district, who had earlier exhorted ST legislators to quit, has convened a meeting of community members on Thursday to discuss preparations for Valmiki Jatre. The issue of reservation is expected to feature and a potential deadline of February 9 might be set for ST MLAs from across parties to resign. There are 15 ST MLAs in the assembly, including nine from BJP. If the nine BJP legislators quit, Yediyurappa’s majority government will be reduced to a minority one.

CHANDIGARH: Nuh police have arrested a man for the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl, whose body was found in the Aravali hills in Ferozpur Jhirka area on December 26, 2019.

According to police, the accused, who was a drug addict, had tried to steal a goat owned by the girl’s family. As she had resisted the act, the accused had allegedly raped and strangulated her with her dupatta, the police said, quoting the confession statement of the accused.

“We have taken him on police remand to recover the clothes he wore on the day of crime and re-construction of the crime scene,” Firozpur Jhirka station house officer (SHO) Hari Singh said.

The accused’s images with the stolen goat were first captured on the CCTV camera installed in Firozpur Jhirka area. On December 28, he was picked up for questioning. Initially, he tried to mislead the police, but later he confessed about the crime.

Police said in order to arrange money for drugs, the accused had stolen a goat belonging to the victim’s family. As the girl spotted the goat, she approached him and tried to take back the animal.

After murdering the girl, the accused used another route to cross Ferozpur Jhirka. He was apprehended before he could take the goat to New Delhi.

She along with two other girls had gone to the Aravali hills to graze the goats. Two girls had returned, but the victim had remained untraceable. On December 26, villagers launched the search and found her body. Her half-naked body was spotted hanging upside down.

Meanwhile, residents of the village where the victim belonged sought death penalty for the accused and urged the Nuh deputy commissioner to write to the home department for fast track trial in the case.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

Ambala: Taking cognizance of the incident in which two Ambala-based sisters Heena (26) and Santosh (29) had been allegedly asked to submit nationality certificates for the issuance of passports, the Ambala deputy commissioner (DC) on Tuesday issued strict instructions and warning to the officials of the Regional Passport Office (RPO), Chandigarh, against such alleged acts. He also instructed the RPO to issue passports to the sisters.

DC Ashok Kumar Sharma said, “The officials in the passport office should not mislead citizens about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The main objective of the office is to look at the basic required papers and make passports available to the people concerned on the basis of those documents.”

The DC said a few days ago, Heena had written a letter to Haryana home minister Anil Vij in which she talked about problems in getting the passports. On September 16, 2019, Heena and Santosh were asked to prove their nationality after bringing ‘nationality certificate’ from the Ambala DC office.

Ambala: Former Haryana chief minister and JBT recruitment scam convict Om Prakash Chautala, who is out on 14-day furlough from Tihar jail, termed his grandson and Jannayak Janata Party leader Dushyant Chautala ’s move to become deputy chief minister in the BJP-JJP government a foolish decision.

Addressing a rally of INLD workers at Ambala on Wednesday, Chautala asked them to unite and strengthen the party.

Talking to mediapersons about the present political situation in Haryana, Chautala said, “Before elections, the situations were in favour of INLD and if they had not left our party, we would have received the mandate, and Dushyant would have become the Haryana chief minister.”

“What would be a more foolish decision than this? He left the CM’s post and became a deputy CM. I have no guarantee that for how many days he will remain at that post. What will happen and where will they go? I do not have any hard feelings for anybody,” he added.

Commenting on Haryana home minister Anil Vij, Chautala said, “Today, he has big departments under his control, but everybody knows about his behaviour. If this ruling government falls in Haryana, then the first reason would be Anil Vij and the second reason could be Dushyant Chautala. Both are fighting for the number one spot.”

Answering a question about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the INLD supremo said, “This decision was not in favour of the country, but for the ruling party. The situation in the nation is poor, and the irresponsible persons are ruling the government. They take no tension for the nation even when India stands for the communal harmony and people of all the religions have their equal rights.”

The daughter of Congress rebel and former minister Nirmal Singh, Chitra Sarwara, who contested recent Haryana assembly elections against Vij from Ambala cantonment segment also accompanied O P Chautala during his Ambala visit.

Most eway fatalities on lanes to Pune

PUNE: Most of the fatal accidents in 2019 on the Pune-Mumbai expressway occurred on the stretch towards the city.Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) officials said 39 people died in accidents on the expressway last year. Of these fatalities, 35 were in the Mumbai to Pune lane.HSP officers cited speeding by motorists beyond the Khandala ghat section of the expressway as the main reason for the accidents on the “Pune corridor”. The HSP refers to the lanes of the expressway towards Pune city from Mumbai as the “Pune corridor”.On December 17, the driver of a car speeding from Mumbai to Pune lost control over the vehicle and it collided with the iron railing of the expressway. Two persons, including the driver, died in the accident. Police said the vehicle was speeding over 120km per hour when the accident occurred.HSP superintendent of police Milind Mohite said, “The stretch from the Amrutanjan bridge in Lonavla to the Kiwale exit of the expressway witnessed most of the accidents in 2019. Speeding beyond the permissible limits was the main reason for these accidents.”The HSP officer said the heavy vehicles mostly moved at a sluggish speed in the Khandala ghat section — from Khopoli to Lonavla — due to the steep gradient. “The lanes are free after the Lonavla exit point of the expressway. From there the heavy vehicles take the side lanes and many cars proceed to Lonavla and its adjoining hill areas,” Mohite said.“The general feeling among the motorists is that they waste a lot of time trailing the heavy vehicles in the ghat section. Once they see the empty lanes after the Lonavla exit point of the expressway, they tend to speed. And in this hurry, many drivers lose control over the wheel and meet with accidents,” he said.The said many accidents have occurred along the shoulder lane of the expressway from Mumbai to Pune. “Many vehicles remain parked on the shoulder lane after developing technical snags. There have been instances of cars speeding and ramming the vehicles parked on the shoulder lane. Vehicles can be parked on the shoulder lane only during an emergency situation or to repair snags,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063381,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-669254,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/35-of-39-expressway-accident-fatalities-in-2019-on-mumbai-pune-stretch/articleshow/73063371.cms

KOLHAPUR: The Sangli police on Monday arrested a man for allegedly murdering his 17-year-old daughter over an affair.

The police have also arrested another man for allegedly raping the 17-year-old in September last year.

“As per initial investigations, the teenager came in contact with a man from another village who had come to to stay with his relatives in her village,” said a police officer. “There was a relationship between the two and when the girl’s father learnt of it, he warned her to end all communication with the man.”

“As per her father’s statement, on Sunday night when he came home after his duty, he checked the call records on her phone and found the girl was calling the man regularly. This enraged him and he hit her on her head with a wooden stick. She fell to the ground unconscious.”

Man arrested for daughter’s death

The girl’s father’s statement said, “On Monday morning, she succumbed to her injuries on the way to a hospital. The hospital authorities declared her brought dead. A case was registered with our police station and we arrested her father,” the police officer said.

“During the post-mortem, it was found that the victim was three months pregnant. Her mother lodged a complaint and we arrested the suspect for allegedly raping a minor in September 2019. We have invoked section 376 and section 3,4,5, 5(J)(2) and 6 of POCSO against him,” he said.

LUCKNOW: To raise tax collection in the state, chief minister Yogi Adityanath authorised officials of the rank of additional chief secretary to take state-owned helicopters to visit commissionerates for field visits.Reviewing tax collections in the state during a meeting on Wednesday, the CM said officials responsible for tax collections should carry out regular field visits. He asked the principal secretary, excise, principal secretary, stamp and registration, and principal secretary, power, to visit the 8 divisions. “We have been told to visit two divisions a day. Each division should be reviewed separately. To ensure we are able to complete work on time, the CM has told us to use state helicopters,” said a senior official.The state has about 14 lakh registered traders and the CM directed officials to increase this number to at least 50 lakh since UP is a largely consumer state. Interestingly, despite a slowdown in tax collections across the country, UP’s tax collection has registered an increase. In November, collections were about 12.4% higher than in the same period in 2018.Reviews should begin from January 15, the CM said, and weekly targets should be set for district officials which will be monitored at the headquarters level.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064024,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-419125,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-officers-to-get-choppers-to-mop-up-tax-cm-yogi-adityanath-gives-nod/articleshow/73063417.cms

Orthodox faction objects to ordinance

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a bid to resolve disputes over burial of bodies in churches under the possession of Jacobite and Orthodox factions, the state cabinet on Wednesday approved an ordinance to ensure burial rights for believers in their church cemeteries. The Orthodox faction has condemned the move, saying it is not in accordance with the Supreme Court verdict and is an attempt to bring in parallel administration in churches.The cabinet has sent the ordinance for the consideration of the governor. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters that the ordinance would ensure the right of any family of a parish to bury bodies of its family members in the cemetery of the church where their family tomb is situated, irrespective of any objection or dispute. If there is no family tomb, a believer’s body will be buried in the cemetery of his/her parish church.Vijayan said the ordinance would also allow the family of the deceased to conduct the post-death rituals anywhere outside the church or cemetery by a priest of their choice. The provision will allow a family to perform the final rites at a Jacobite church and conduct the burial in an Orthodox church where the family tomb is situated and vice versa.He said the government had to take the decision as the cabinet subcommittee that was formed to resolve the disputes between the Orthodox and Jacobite factions could not succeed in its efforts.“One of the factions refused to even discuss the matter with the sub-committee. There is nothing illegal in the ordinance. The usual custom is that a body should be buried at the earliest and when one section decides not to concede to any solution, the government cannot be a mute spectator. We are also not going against anything ruled by the Supreme Court,” the chief minister said.The Jacobite Church has welcomed the move but Orthodox Church episcopal synod secretary Metropolitan Yuhanon Mar Diascoros said the clause in the ordinance that anyone can cremate the body of a parish member in the cemetery cannot be approved.“The right for getting buried in a cemetery belonging to Orthodox Church is only for those belonging to the parish church. The vicar of the parish is in charge of the cemetery. The clause allowing anyone to enter the cemetery and bury the dead is a violation of the Supreme Court verdict. The Supreme Court had made it clear that it will not allow parallel rule in the cemetery. Burying bodes in the cemetery without the permission of priests who have officially become the vicars through the court judgment will create anarchy,” he said.The cabinet also decided to re-promulgate the Kerala education (amendment) ordinance 2019, the Kerala devaswom recruitment board (amendment) ordinance 2019, the Kerala state goods and services tax (amendment) ordinance and the Kerala minerals ordinance.",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063478,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-29160,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ordinance-to-allow-jacobite-burials-in-orthodox-churches-vice-versa/articleshow/73063486.cms

Woman’s fatal fall accidental or suicidal, suggest forensic officers

KOLKATA: A 29-year-old woman, celebrating New Year’s Eve with her husband on the terrace of their home in Poddarnagar, south Kolkata, was killed after she fell down four storeys through a narrow shaft between two adjacent buildings in the early hours of Wednesday.Sweetie Sutradhar, who used to work in a call centre, was found in a pool of blood by neighbours at the bottom of the shaft of her neighbouring building after her husband, Kuntal Acharjee, raised the alarm about her being missing. He was detained and being questioned by officers of Kolkata Police’s homicide department till late on Wednesday over certain discrepancies in his statement. Forensic officers indicated, however, that there were signs of the death being accidental.Police said Sweetie and Kuntal had come back to their rented apartment from a party around midnight. At that time, a group of residents of the same building were partying on the rooftop. While the others came down around 12.30am, Kuntal told cops that he and his wife stayed back drinking.“Kuntal said that after some time, he felt tipsy and came back to their third-floor flat and passed out,” said a senior officer of Kolkata Police’s south suburban division. “According to him, he woke up in the morning and noticed his wife wasn’t there, and began a search.”Even as the residents began a search, someone opened a door of the shaft at the ground floor of the neighbouring building and found Sweetie’s body. The residents immediately called officers of Jadavpur police station, who rushed her to MR Bangur Hospital, where she was declared dead.The shaft (circled) between the two adjacent buildings, through which Sweetie (left) fell to her deathResidents have also told cops they heard a muffled cry of a woman sometime between 2.30am and 3am on Wednesday and even called cops to check. “A team of officers from Jadavpur police station visited our apartment and conducted a search, but they could not find anything. Even the noise had ceased when they came,” said an elderly resident of the building.Officers of the forensic and homicide departments went to the spot. While homicide department officers said nothing concrete could immediately be said about how Sweetie had fallen till they received a detailed postmortem report, forensic officials suggested that it looked accidental or suicidal.“Had someone pushed the woman from the terrace, the body would have maintained a certain distance from the wall during the fall. But the fall trajectory doesn’t show any such sign. There are some distinct marks close to the wall throughout the shaft’s outer wall, which can be present only when the victim tries to hold on to something to avert the fall,” said a senior forensic official.He added there were some marks to show the victim spent considerable time on the edge of the shaft before falling down.Cops said Sweetie, who hailed from Asansol, got married to Kuntal, a video editor, a year ago. The couple moved to the Poddarnagar flat four months ago. “We have heard the youth’s family owns a hotel at Tarapith. They seemed peaceful and we have never heard any kind of rift between them,” said Kabita Roy Chowdhury, who lives on the ground floor of the building.The cops said the two adjacent buildings have a common 2.5ft-high parapet, and they were checking whether Sweetie had somehow lost her balance. “As she was new to the building, it is possible she may had tried to cross over to the other terrace by jumping over the parapet. Those not familiar with the place would also not know about the shaft. It is possible she had fallen down accidentally under the influence of liquor. But nothing can be clearly said till we get the postmortem and ante-mortem reports,” said an officer.“We have started a case of unnatural death. We are looking into all angles and are speaking to residents of the building, along with the husband, to find out how the woman could have fallen down,” said an officer.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063517,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-103837,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-new-year-party-on-terrace-turns-fatal-for-29-year-old-woman/articleshow/73063454.cms

MANGALURU: Two weeks after violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act left two protesters dead in Mangaluru , various organisations and citizens have collected over Rs 2 crore to help their families and those who were injured in the clashes.

“Funds started pouring in after Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa rolled back Rs 10 lakh compensation to the families of each victim that he had announced after the violence,” police officials probing the violence said.

Former MLA BA Mohiuddeen Bava is among those who are involved in collecting the funds. However, he refused to divulge details about the money collected so far. “Contributions may stop if we reveal this information. We are trying to help the victims’ families and the injured. They are facing financial difficulties after the recent violence,” he said.

On December 19, anti-CAA protests turned violent and a mob allegedly tried to attack a police station.

Over 12 people being treated in hospitals

Nauseen Kudroli, 49, and Jaleel Bengre, 23, were killed when Mangaluru police opened fire to control the protesters.

Sources said that over 12 people, who were injured during the protests, are still being treated at various hospitals in the coastal city.

“Over Rs 2 crore has been collected to help the victims. Contributors have decided that Rs 25 lakh each will be given to Kudroli and Bengre’s families. The rest will be given to the injured protesters. We don’t know when the funds will be handed over to them,” a senior police officer told TOI.

Former chief ministers Siddaramaiah and HD Kumaraswamy have already announced compensation to the victims’ families. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee recently announced Rs 5 lakh each for the two families.

Deaths of kids at J K Lon hosp saw slide since 2014

KOTA/JAIPUR: At least nine more infants have died at Kota’s J K Lon hospital in the last two days, taking the toll to 100 in December 2019.The number of infant deaths in the same hospital in December 2018 was 77, the hospital authorities confirmed on Wednesday.“At least nine newborns and infants have died in J K Lon hospital on December 30 and 31. The number of kids’ deaths in December has reached 100,” the hospital superintendent, Dr Suresh Dulara, said on Wednesday.He added, “On December 30, four kids died and on December 31, five kids died. All of them died mainly due to low birth weight and birth weight hypothesis.”The state government on Tuesday ordered hospitals attached to medical colleges to check the functional status of all medical equipment and send reports.Last week, chief minister Ashok Gehlot and health minister Raghu Sharma had claimed that that most of the children who died were referred to the hospital in critical condition from nearby districts, including regions of neighbouring Madhya Pradesh.The hospital superintendent claimed on Wednesday that the number of infant deaths at the hospital in 2019 was lower than 2018 and the lowest in last six years.“At least 1,005 kids died in 2018 in the hospital, while 963 died in 2019,” said Dulara. The number of infant deaths at J K Lon Hospital has witnessed a constant decline since 2014 when 1,198 deaths were recorded, which was 7.6% of the 15,719 admitted, according to data from Kota district collector Om Kasera and the hospital superintendent. The percentage declined to 7.2% in 2015, 6.6% in 2016, 5.9% in 2017, 6.1% in 2018 and 5.7 %, the lowest, in 2019, the hospital superintendent said.Following the controversy over the high number of infant deaths in December 2019 alone, the hospital has put in efforts for the upgradation and maintenance of its medical equipment, as well as reconstruction of paediatric units and deputations to make up the insufficiency of medical and nursing staff in the hospital.The principal of Medical College Kota, Dr Vijay Sardana, said, “The units of the paediatric department have been subdivided into three units. The HOD’s office will be in J K Lon Hospital and the non teaching unit will be working on the New Medical College Hospital premises.”He added, “A work order for installation of a central oxygen supply line in the hospital has been issued and work would be completed within 15 days. Proposals for new OPD and emergency wards for the paediatric and gynecology departments have been incorporated in the proposed OPD block under the Smart City Project.”Taking serious note of TOI’s report on December 30 headlined “Over 50% of gadgets in Kota hospital where kids died defunct”, the medical education department wrote to the principals and controllers of all medical colleges saying: “An immediate stock-taking of all the equipment should be carried out to make sure that all the gadgets are in use and their annual maintenance contracts (AMCs) are in place.”“For equipment whose AMCs have not been done, the process should be immediately initiated after stock-taking,” wrote Vaibhav Galriya, principal secretary, medical education.While pointing out that some equipment might be lying in hospital stores after purchase, he directed that a physical verification of the stores be done to ensure that such machines are identified and put to use immediately.Galriya has also pulled up doctors while pointing out that hospitals are not properly maintaining IPD bed tickets. “It has also been observed in some hospitals that IPD bed tickets are not being properly maintained. History and clinical notes of the patients are incomplete. All departments and treating doctors must be instructed to make sure that proper recording of patients’ medical information is done after their admission to the IPD,” he said in the circular.Also, proper counselling of patients and their attendants should be done. “They should be briefed regarding the disease and health of the patients,” he wrote.To prevent infection from spreading, he pointed out that microbiological surveillance of operation theatres (OTs) and ICUs must be regularly done at least once a month and samples taken from all relevant portions of OTs and ICUs.The hospitals attached to medical colleges will also ensure that bacteriological reports of the samples should detail the bacteria for which the culture is positive or negative and take curative action. Standard infection control practices, including hand hygiene, should be ensured in all OTs, ICUs, labour and procedure rooms, said Galriya’s directions to all medical colleges.In Video: More children die in Kota hospital, toll rises to 100",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063621,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-52591,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/9-more-kids-die-in-kota-hospital-death-toll-at-100-in-december/articleshow/73063545.cms

K’taka, Rlys adopt model

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh government has set a 7-day deadline for response to property attachment notices slapped on those accused of damaging public property during citizenship protests.More than 150 notices have been issued by the Lucknow administration since chief minister Yogi Adityanath declared those who indulged in violence will have to compensate for damages.Reviewing security arrangements in the aftermath of massive protests across the state during anti-CAA protests, the chief minister had directed police and administration to expedite identification of ‘rioters’ through photographs and video footage and swiftly issue notices. “In Lucknow, around 150 notices were issued. The accused will be given a week to present their side, but if the committee is not satisfied, proceedings will begin to extract compensation. If they are not in a position to pay, their properties will be attached and auctioned,” said a senior official in the government.Under fire from National Human Rights Commission for alleged police excesses during the protests, the CM also directed the administration to forward video clips of protestors to NHRC to bolster the government’s position.The government has taken recourse to a 2010 Allahabad high court order which allows the government to claim damages for public property destroyed during protests or riots from those convicted for violence.Even though the CM has drawn flak from Opposition parties, Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddiyurappa declared he too would take similar action against protesters. Yogi’s model is also being followed by the Railways.Meanwhile, the chief minister has said since protests were triggered by rumours and misinformation, police should reach out to the people, especially among the minority community, and tell them CAA will not take away citizenship. For this, help should be taken from the intellectual class, media professionals, professors, doctors and religious leaders.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063638,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-218741,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-government-sets-7-day-deadline-for-response-to-seizure-notices/articleshow/73063625.cms

LUCKNOW: Nearly six months after 11 tribals were killed in indiscriminate firing by the head of Umbha village in Sonbhadra over a land dispute, police authorities on Wednesday penalised five cops with a fine equal to their 30-day salary for lackadaisical attitude which led to violence.Superintendent of police, Sonbhadra, Ashish Srivastava said, “When village head Yagya Dutt tried to forcibly grab a disputed piece of land in 2017, police inspector Shiv Kumar Mishra and his predecessor Mool Chand Chauhan, did not pay heed to complaints by Gond tribals. They handled the matter with a prejudiced approach.”“Three constables – Kanhaiya Lal, Sudhakar Yadav and Pramod Kumar Singh – did not act as per rule of law and followed directions of their senior officers. As a result, 30 days’ salary of these cops will not be given to them for their services,” he added. On July17 last year, a group of villagers belonging to Gond tribe were carrying out farming on disputed land when a group of men, led by gram pradhan Yagya Dutt, reached there to take possession of the land which, they claimed, was purchased by him and his relatives in 2017.This led to violence which left 11 tribals killed and 21 others injured.The government ordered an SIT probe into the incident which is still pending.Sonabahdra district police also launched a probe into the role of cops who had served at Ghorawal police station under whose jurisdiction Umbha village falls.

JAIPUR: A Pakistani Hindu migrant girl’s request to sit for the Class XII board exam this year has been allegedly turned down by the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) citing technical reasons.Dami Kohli, who migrated from the neighbouring country’s Sindh province and currently settled in Jodhpur , had cleared her Class X board exam from Pakistan and then passed her Class XI exam after migrating to India in August 2018.“I was completely devastated when my form was rejected. We had faced immense problems in Pakistan and are hoping for a better future in India,” said Dami.State education minister Govind Singh Dotasra, who intervened in the matter on Wednesday evening, said the government was thinking of allowing her to sit for the exam and added that they had already sent a letter to the Pakistan high commission seeking details.“We haven’t received any reply from them. We want to know the details of their syllabus and do a comparative analysis. They are yet to reply. Any technical glitch will affect the future of the girl which we are trying to avoid,” said Dotasra.An RBSE official, who did not wish to be named, said whenever a student clears an exam from any other board, the standard is checked. “There are times when the marking system of the other board is lenient than RBSE. In that case, we have to look into whether the student would be able to pass as per our standards.

The three big targets this year...

What about All England title? Do you think it has lost its charm?

If you’re asked to choose between 2016 Olympic silver and 2019 World championship title, which one do you like the most?

Do you think 2019 could have been better?

You won only one title (Worlds) last year and lost in the first and second rounds of several tournaments. Your opponents think that you are unpredictable...

How do you suddenly raise your game in big tournaments. It happened in 2013, '14, '16 and '19?

How does leading Hyderabad Hunters help your game?

What are the areas of your game that you’d like to improve?

How do you look at women’s field in 2020?

Your match against Tai is being billed as the match of PBL...

Do you think Tai is no longer a force to reckon with on the circuit?

After the career high of a world crown in 2019, PV Sindhu has turned her attention to Olympic gold this year. While touching upon a lot of topics around her game and targets during an interview with TOI, the 25-year-old believes that unpredictability is her strength.Excerpts:Olympic gold will be the first and most important target. Then to become No.1 in the world and win a few of super series titles.All England is a prestigious tournament. Every tournament is important, but Olympics is the most important and World championships after that. All England is also on my radar and so I said some of the super series titles.Both are different memories. In 2016 nobody thought Sindhu will win in Rio. Then Sindhu was just one good player. But now after that silver, the level of recognition and responsibility is quite high. This world title also no one expected me to win. Both are very different from each other and very good memories.I wanted to win a few more super series titles. But then, I am happy as I won the World championships gold, Indonesia silver. It’s been a good year.Unpredictability is my strength. I feel it is good thing. It depends on the day, the shuttle, surroundings, drift etc. But I never felt bad about my early round losses. Despite first-round losses, the belief that I will play well in the next tournament is very strong. World championship is a very happy moment.I don’t know how I play well in big tournaments. Or if it is a good sign or a bad sign. But I am happy that I play well in big tournaments. So I want it to be like that always. It’s not that I want to lose small tournaments and win only the big ones. Sometimes luck also matters. I lost matches when I had big lead and I also came back from big deficits.It is very helpful. For example, Lionel a senior player used to tell me several important things like I should be more alert on court. I think the advice helped. It is going to be more of fun this year as we know each other. A few new players have joined the team so we will give our best, whatever happens will happen.After the Worlds, a lot of people have been telling me about some aspects of my game. I am working on them. I am working on patience and fitness. All other aspects of my game are good. The most important thing is to play the right stroke at the right time.Now the top 10 to 15 players are of the same standard. They are so many best players from different countries. Tai Tzu (Ying), (Nozomi) Okuhara, the Korean girls, Ratchanok Intanon, Chen Yu Fei, etc. All of them prepare well. On that day we have to give our best. If plan ‘A’ doesn’t work, we have to come up with plan ‘B’. There is no particular strategy.Everyone in PBL are waiting for the match between me and Tai Tzu. It’s definitely going to be a good match. PBL has always been very interesting and exciting because it is a team event. It happens only once in a year and there will be different players and we have to play for the team. The atmosphere is very different, the support we get from the team and the assistance we get from different coaches is all quite different. They will tell their views, point out our mistakes and these small things will add to our game.The Taiwanese player was unbeatable for a long time but now people are able to read her game well. The game is constantly changing. If I play a certain type of game in one tournament, I will play a different game the next time. It is a challenge to steal the point from the opponent. We have to consistently find where the opponent is vulnerable and catch them unawares. It is very important.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063734,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-275926,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/badminton/pv-sindhus-mission-2020-the-olympic-gold/articleshow/73063624.cms

LUCKNOW: A western disturbance that originated from the Mediterranean Sea and hit the Himalayas after crosscrossing from over Iraq, Iran and Pakistan brought relief from severe cold conditions in the city on Wednesday. The relief, however, will be shortlived because western disturbance is expected to cause snow in the hills and rains in UP and Lucknow from Thursday till Saturday.

The minimum temperature on Wednesday was 4 degrees Celsius while the maximum was 20.1degrees Celsius, one unit below normal. “Western disturbance along with a cyclonic circulation over Haryana and easterlies is expected to cause a few spells of light to moderate rain in some parts of UP including Lucknow,” said State Met director JP Gupta. There is also possibility of hail on Friday in isolated places.

414,['2/01/2020'],"Life could have originated in ‘soda lakes’, says study","WASHINGTON: The early Earth may have hosted many carbonate-rich lakes, which contained high enough phosphorus concentrations to get life started on our planet, according to a study.Phosphorus is one of the six main chemical elements of life, and forms the backbone of DNA and RNA molecules. The element acts as the main currency for energy in all cells and anchors the lipids that separate cells from their surrounding environment.“For 50 years, what’s called ‘the phosphate problem’, has plagued studies on the origin of life,” said Jonathan Toner, an assistant professor at the University of Washington (UW) in the US. The problem is that chemical reactions that make the building blocks of living things need a lot of phosphorus, but the element is scarce.The new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has found an answer to this problem in certain types of lakes. The research focused on lakes rich in carbonate — a salt of carbonic acid — which form in dry environments. Because of high evaporation rates, the lake waters concentrate into salty and alkaline, or high-pH, solutions. Such lakes, also known as alkaline or soda lakes, are found on all seven continents, the researchers said.They first looked at phosphorus measurements in existing carbonate-rich lakes, including Mono Lake in California Lake Magadi in Kenya and Lonar Lake in India. While the exact concentration depends on where the samples were taken, the researchers found that carbonate-rich lakes have up to 50,000 times phosphorus levels found in seawater, rivers and other types of lakes.“The extremely high phosphate levels would have driven reactions that put phosphorus into the molecular building blocks of RNA, proteins, and fats, all of which were needed to get life going,” said David Catling, a professor at UW. The carbon dioxide-rich air some four billion years ago would have been ideal for creating such lakes and allowing them to reach maximum levels of phosphorus, the researchers said.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063805,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-321106,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/life-could-have-originated-in-soda-lakes-says-study/articleshow/73063781.cms

Our food budget has increased by 30-40% a month.”Potato prices have also gone up by 20-100%. Potatoes, which were available at Rs 20 till last week, now cost Rs 25-40 per kg.Suresh, a wholesaler at Dubbaga Mandi, said the prices of tomato and potato had gone up due to reduction in supply following damages to the crop due to extremely cold weather prevailing for about a month in different parts of the country.

With the first batch of trained students passing out this year, Kapashi said the university will have to wait for at least two-more years before it can have sizable number of trained first responders who can react to a medical emergency that gets flagged to them via the app.The university is toying with the idea of rolling this App, that is presently at a conceptual stage, on a trial basis in Bengaluru and Mangaluru that has sizable number of medical colleges and will present the perfect pool for trained manpower to roll out this service. The idea is to ensure that a person trained in life saving skills can reach the emergency site within 15 minutes, which in a place like Bengaluru might be a bit hard to achieve, he surmised.With geo-tagging of a trained life saver, the app will flash the emergency on to their cell phones and a person nearest to the site could go over and help the person, he said. The advanced lifesaving course mandatory for medical students and basic lifesaving course that others including those opting for allied health sciences courses study deals with topics such as burns, ingesting poison, snake bites, respiratory issues and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, he said.Dr S Sacchidanand, vice-chancellor, RGUHS said the university spent the first three years in developing around 250 master trainers for this programme who in turn trained teachers of medical colleges in the state.

Apart from shot put, Rambhi also learned discus throwing again from the videos. While she had won the second prize in discus throw in 2017 Khel Mahakumbh, she stood third in the game in 2018 and also bagged the first and second prize at the university-level competitions in the same sports.

""I am proud of my daughter. She has been interested in sports, especially, discus throw and shot put, since her childhood. I have always encouraged her in sports. I am glad that an event like Khel Mahakumbh has recognized her achievements,"" said Rambhi's father, Devsi Seeda.

Habib said that this is absolutely incorrect as these leaders had never said such things. “I was present in the meeting, which was being quoted by the Governor,” claimed Prof Habib.He said that he would have reacted in the same manner, if the governor had misquoted anyone else and used “inappropriate” words against any community. He said he stopped the governor as he was “abusing” the sacrifices of these great leaders, even when the audience was objecting to it, he claimed.On being asked about breaking protocol as Governor Khan alleged that Habib went on to the extent of pushing aside his security aides while he was speaking, Prof Habib, said that History Congress also has a protocol that police should not have been deployed at the rostrum, but they were present there.Explaining the series of events of the day, Habib said, that he was stopped by the police on rostrum, when he was going towards Governor and that is against the rules of IHC. He said, “I pushed them back and walked towards him”.He admitted that he asked the Governor to quote Nathuram Godse, when he did not stop speaking against Maulana Azad and Mahatma Gandhi.On December 28, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan alleged that eminent Habib tried to disrupt his inaugural address at the Indian History Congress and said this ""intolerance"" towards a different opinion was “undemocratic”.

MEERUT: Police on Wednesday found the charred body of a 14-year-old boy from Haryana 's Panipat town, 40km from west UP's Shamli district where his father - a 'bhajan' singer - mother and elder sister were found murdered a day ago.

The accused, Himanshu Saini, an aide of 'bhajan' singer Ajay Pathak (45), was arrested by Haryana police. According to Panipat police, Saini was arrested when he was trying to flee after setting ablaze Pathak's SUV which had his son, Bhagwad's body. Police have sent the charred body for forensic and post-mortem examination.

It all happened a day after Ajay, his wife Sneha Pathak (42) and daughter Vasundhra Pathak (16) were murdered with a sharp-edged weapon at their Shamli house. Police said during interrogation, Himanshu confessed to have killed the entire family for not returning Rs 60,000 they owed to him. Himanshu alleged that he was insulted by Ajay every time he asked for his money .

The accused confessed to have killed the family with ""one of the many swords which were kept at their home"". Shamli SP Vineet Jaiswal said, ""Himanshu had dinner with the family on Monday, and decided to kill them after he was allegedly humiliated by Ajay.""

""After dinner, as the family was sleeping, he first went to Ajay's room and attacked him and his wife Sneha with a sword. Then he went to Vasundhra's room and killed her. He then strangulated 14-year-old Bhagwad to death,"" said SP Jaiswal. Police said Himanshu planned to dispose all the bodies. He first took Bhagwad's body to Panipat. ""But, when he got to know that the news of the murders has spread, he set the car on fire,"" said Jaiswal.

423,['2/01/2020'],Jaipur night shelters overcrowded as mercury continues its slide,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot distributes blankets at a night shelter in the city on Wednesday.

JAIPUR: As the city is witnessing one of the coldest winters of the last few decades, there has been a rise in the number of people taking refuge in nights shelters.

According to the management of the night shelters , the number of people coming there has seen a steady rise in the last four days. There are 14 shelters with a capacity of 50 to 150 people. People coming to the shelters, however, vary from 70 to 200 per night.

Santosh Gupta, manager of the night shelter near Ram Niwas Bagh, said they had been running out of blankets and mattresses in the last couple of days. “We are facing space crunch. All the slots get filled by 7 pm and we have to ask people to get their own blankets and let them sleep inside. We even ask people to adjust with more people on one mattress or else extra people have to sleep on carpeted floor,” said Santosh.

On Tuesday night, chief minister Ashok Gehlot visited night shelters situated near Ram Niwas Bagh and near JK Lone Hospital. Gehlot distributed blankets to the people and asked for their well being.

Night shelter is divided into two portions - men and women/children. The women portion is separated with a temporary wall and a curtain. Most of the women coming at the shelters are accompanied by men.

As per the norms of the shelter, persons with valid identity cards are allowed inside. Their card is taken for the night and given back to them in the morning. “It is better for the security for the people staying here or else there are chances of theft. At least with this we will be sure who all are staying here,” said Manoj Saini, manager of a night shelter.

Some people have objected to this. Sunita and her family, who live near the JK Lone Hospital, said they were not allowed to live inside the shelter because they didn’t have the documents. “Night shelter is supposed to be for the poor and needy people like us and if identity cards are made a pre-requirement, than the purpose of the shelters is lost,” said Sunita.

HYDERABAD: Even as Telangana is gearing up to carry out the National Population Register ( NPR ) exercise, the state government does not have a proper district-wise data on various parameters, which would be crucial for framing policies and implementing various government schemes.For example, if the government wants to focus on agriculture or irrigation facilities in a particular district, data on the number of operational landholdings and size of the landholding, net area irrigated and other details is a must. With no data available, planning will take a hit.With no district-wise details, the government has not come out with the statistical report in the last two years.The last report published by the directorate of economics and statistics in 2017 (fourth edition) was based on 2015 for some categories and depended on 2016 information for other categories.When contacted, director of economics and statistics department A Sudarshan Reddy said the reports were not published for the last two years. The 2017 report was based partially on 2015 and partially on 2016 information mainly due to non-availability of data from newly-created districts. “We will soon come out with the latest report,” the director said.The government created 21 new districts, which were carved out from 10 districts that existed in October 2016. Two more districts -- Mulugu and Narayanpet — were created in early 2019. Generally, the economics and statistics department collects data from each department, compiles and publishes information in the form of a report every October.Officials said that as many as 28 categories of information pertaining to each district such as demographics and population, health, climate change , livestock, agriculture, education, health, forest, transport, industries, mining, energy, banking, crime and police, industries, tourism and judicial data are compiled in the report.“The revenue department took more than a year to provide boundaries of new districts, mandals and revenue divisions. The government not only created new districts, but also created over 100 new mandals (now 589 mandals). Similarly, revenue divisions were also created. Since transfer of villages happened in the past couple of years, lack of records, staff crunch for compilation and series of elections have led to delay in compilation of the reports,” a senior planning official said. There were allegations that district collectors have not taken interest to send the data to the government.Interestingly, a couple of months ago, the census department wrote to the state government on 460 missing villages in about half a dozen districts after new district were formed and sought a clarification before carrying out Census-2021.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063958,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-404852,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-lacks-district-wise-data-on-parameters-crucial-for-planning/articleshow/73063959.cms

KOLKATA: The New Year day turned out to be pleasant in Kolkata, minus the sharp chill that had descended last week.Even as the temperature climbs, Kolkata is set to receive rain during the later half of Thursday. While showers could be moderate, the western districts of the state could be lashed by heavier rain. The rain could continue in Kolkata on Friday, though it could lose intensity and taper off by the weekend. Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 12.1°C on Wednesday.A cyclonic circulation over northwest Madhya Pradesh is set to trigger clouds, leading to rain in Bengal, said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. “It’s being fed moisture by the easterly winds flowing in from Bay of Bengal. The circulation has been formed partly by a western disturbance that has been moving towards central India from Jammu and Kashmir over the last few days,” said Das.He added the circulation will move closer to Chattisgarh on Thursday and start generating clouds that will float into Bengal. “The impact will be felt by Thursday and the day will remain cloudy. As a result, day temperature will climb down. But the minimum temperature will rise to 14°C degrees and should remain there at least till Friday,” said Das.While the cloud cover is set to pull the maximum temperature down to 20°C, the minimum could fall once the rainy spell ends.An uninterrupted flow of chilly northwesterly winds led to a lowering of temperature across south Bengal last week. Cold-wave conditions prevailed at Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum, Jhargram, West Burdwan, East Burdwan, East and West Midnapore and Murshidabad last Saturday.

In case of Bumrah, he was first selected to play for Gujarat but then told by BCCI president Sourav Ganguly to pull out

From left, Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube and Mayank Agarwal

MUMBAI: A few days back, some of the former cricketers and the media ripped into Shreyas Iyer and Shivam Dube for not turning up for Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy game against the Railways at the Wankhede Stadium on Christmas Day despite no international commitment in that period. Missing them badly, Mumbai suffered a crushing 10-wicket defeat, their first to Railways.

Around the same time, pacer Navdeep Saini too missed Delhi’s Ranji Trophy game against Hyderabad, citing that he had “been asked to rest”. On Tuesday, it emerged that India’s Test opener Mayank Agarwal will miss Karnataka’s Ranji Trophy match against Mumbai, which begins at the MCA BKC Complex from Friday.

TOI has learnt that Iyer, Dube and Agarwal were all “advised rest” by the “medical team of the Indian team,” which comprises physio Nitin Patel and trainer Nick Webb.

“Team India’s medical team of the Indian team monitors the workload of all the players in the side. Iyer and Dube were asked to rest as per its advice. Mayank has played two games so far, but he needs to rest a bit now because then he will leave with the India A team for New Zealand on January 10. Whenever a player is asked to rest from domestic games, skipper Virat Kohli, coach Ravi Shastri and chief selector MSK Prasad are informed about it,” said a reliable source in the board.

“It’s important to manage the workload of all the India players, so that they’re fresh and fit when they play for India. Sometimes, in this period when they’re asked to rest, they’re supposed to just train for a week and not play any cricket. There is so much non-stop cricket these days that workload management is paramount,” he explained. “The medical team maintains a database of all the players, their injuries and matches played.” he added.

However, there is an argument that the India players’ missing the Ranji Trophy despite being available to play devalues India’s biggest domestic tournament. There was also the case of pacer Jasprit Bumrah , first being asked by the selectors to play for Gujarat in the Ranji Trophy against Kerala in Surat but then being told to pull out by BCCI president Sourav Ganguly, a fact that got the attention of the legendary Sunil Gavaskar who wrote in a column that he hoped that it would be an exception.

“It’s not that all India players have stopped playing in the Ranji Trophy. In New Zealand, Mayank will be playing in both the limited-overs and the four-day first-class games. Ajinkya Rahane and Prithvi Shaw are playing for Mumbai. KL Rahul played in both the Vijay Hazare and Mushtaq Ali Trophy for Karnataka. At a time when you have IPL, T20 cricket and the India A tours, you have to give players sufficient time to recuperate and stay fresh,” he stressed.

CCTV camera footage shows the man who allegedly took away lingerie in Adambakkam

CHENNAI: Police have launched a hunt for a man who has been allegedly stealing women's lingerie in Adambakkam area. The man, believed to be in his 40s, would frequent houses looking for the innerwear of women left to dry.

The residents of an apartment complex in New Colony, Adambakkam, found the lingerie of women going missing during nights and checked CCTV camera footage. They were shocked when the footage showed a man hiding his face using a shawl and wearing a lungi entering the complex scaling the compound wall. He was found peeping into the bedrooms of residents and lifting the lingerie. He apparently made sure that the residents were asleep and then went on to steal their clothes.

With the help of surveillance cameras, police found he only stole innerwear from among clothes left to dry outside houses and those hung near windows. Based on the CCTV camera footage, the residents have lodged a complaint with the Adambakkam police.

Police believe the number of victims could be higher. Police sources said that initially residents believed that the lingerie could have gone missing accidentally until more women came up with similar complaints. They suspect that the culprit may have stolen the clothes at irregular times from different areas in the neighbourhood, making his capture difficult.

""So far, we haven't received complaints from residents from other localities,"" said an investigation officer. As of now, police said that they can't reach a conclusion about the motive for the man stealing the lingerie. ""The case is weird,"" an officer said.

Police said that the culprit's face was not clearly visible in the CCTV footage, though they were confident that his physical appearance could help them crack the case. Police are yet to register any case in connection with the incidents.

433,['2/01/2020'],‘Startup policy should give bigger roles to investors’,"This story is from January 2, 2020

JAIPUR: The startup draft policy has laid out an ambitious target of creating 1 lakh jobs and facilitated growth of 2,000 startups. While the industry said the measures will improve the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the state, the government also needs to involve the private sector players as they are better placed to know what works and what does not as they have already invested large sums of money in startups.

In order to empower and handhold startups, the draft policy proposed to waive off conditions like prior experience and turnover so that they can participate in government contracts. The objective of the initiative is to invite solutions for citizen-centric services provided by the government.

While the government has proposed a process for selecting ideas or startups involving IT or e-governance experts and government officials, Mahavir Sharma, chairman of TiE Global Board, said representatives from non-profits in the sector should be involved for identifying better ideas. “Government departments should just be observers. You don’t just need sector specific experts but also real investors who know what else is happening in India and the world in early stage startup ecosystem. Officials from the specific departments which need the solution should be there as has been mentioned but having investors would be very effective,” said Sharma.

The draft also makes provision for a RAJIV fund which can invest up to 25% in SEBI approved Alternative Investment Funds. But Sharma RAJIV fund should co-invest in accredited Angel networks across India. “The early ecosystem needs angel funding and not funding by funds. “The startups in Rajasthan need support at the lower level. By investing in the funds that will invest later might be premature at this stage,” added Sharma.

On the constitution of evaluation and implementation panel, he said academicians and transferable government officials don’t make good evaluators or investors. “People who have invested and succeeded make good evaluators. The government should not be in the process of evaluating actual startups. They should let proven Angel investors or VCs do it and co-invest with them. There should be a committee of all the above to evaluate the co-investor not the startups,” he added.

File picture of locusts at a field in Jaisalmer.

JAIPUR: The state cabinet on Wednesday urged the Centre to send new machines to Rajasthan to control the menace of locusts.

“This is a matter of concern that farmers had to incur so much losses because of crop damage due to locusts. A central team was in the state to assess the situation and had sent machines to end the menace,” said state health minister Raghu Sharma after the cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

“Now, the Centre has shifted those machines to Gujarat to control the situation in the state. Therefore, we are demanding the Centre to send new machines to Rajasthan so that locust menace could be brought under control,” he added.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had on Sunday ordered a special girdawari to assess crop damage due to locust attacks.

The CM held a public meeting at Dhanau Panchayat Samiti headquarters on Monday after seeing crop damage caused by locusts in Mithi Nadi village of Dhanau tehsil in Barmer district . He was on a two-day visit to western Rajasthan, which has been badly affected by locust attacks. The cabinet also approved making Nirogi Rajasthan a mass movement. ""About 50,000-60,000 Anganwadi workers will be part of the movement. Awarness programmes will be organised in schools for the screening of the children. About 8-9 departments will be clubbed in the entire campaign. The role of various departments were also discussed in the meeting,"" said Sharma.

JAIPUR: Two girls who climbed the overhead water tank on Rajasthan University campus remained there for the third day on Wednesday. In the afternoon, they threw a cloth soaked in petrol threatening to immolate themselves if the first grade teachers’ exam was not postponed.

First grade teachers’ exam is on January 3 and the government had already announced that they won’t shift the exam date.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had announced that 3,000 vacancies for the first grade teachers’ exam would be announced in September. This did not go well with a couple of candidates who are protesting on campus for past few days braving the harsh winter. Police officers, fire tenders and an ambulance have been on alert near the water tank for the last three days. Senior police officers also reached the spot on Wednesday to convince the girls, but they faced students’ ire. A police officer said they were trying to put a safety net around the tank, but were disallwoed by their supporters. “We requested the candidates to let us put safety net but they refused. If a girl falls off accidentally from the tank, her life would be in danger,” said the officer.

BJP MP Kirori Lal Meena, who has been supporting the students, reached the spot and requested the girls to climb down, but left unsuccessfully in the evening.

Meanwhile, candidates who are preparing for the recruitment exam are tensed. A candidate said at a time when the economy is down and unemployment is raising, this protest is putting their future at stake.

437,['2/01/2020'],Realme ColorOS 6: Realme seems to have learnt from Xiaomi’s ‘pain’,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Chinese smartphone maker Realme has decided to show ads on its phones. This is bad news for many users as they don’t like the clutter of annoying ads on their phone’s UI. But there is a silver lining to the news too, as Realme will also include a provision to disable all the ads with a single tap. And that’s where the former Oppo sub-brand appears to have learnt from its arch-rival Xiaomi , as it is painstakingly difficult to disable ads in MIUI . Realme will roll out the ads in India to all its phones running ColorOS 6 and above with the next update.

Users can recognise the ads by “commercial content recommendation”, a long-winded term coined by Realme. These ads (or commercial content recommendation) will appear in the Phone manager app and Security Check page by default after the update gets installed. To disable them, Realme phone owners can go to Settings > Additional settings > Get recommendations and then switch it off. That’s it. One tap to block every ad. Something like this hasn’t been possible in a Xiaomi phone yet, with users having to disable every single ad one by one manually, even in flagships like the Poco F1 . Realme has been doing really well in the Indian market since its inception in 2018 by targeting the budget and the mid-range smartphone segment and has thus begun to be known for its affordable devices.

Realme’s latest smartphone launch is Realme X2, that comes at a starting price of Rs 16,999. The key features of the handset are 64MP quad AI camera (with ultra wide angle and macro lenses) and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G processor, that’s said to enhance the gaming performance of the phone. There is a 32MP AI front camera with a Super Nightscape mode. The device is backed by a 4000mAh battery and comes with 30W VOOC Charge Flash 4.0 that is claimed to charge the phone to 65% in 30 minutes.

CHANDIGARH: The resident welfare association of a society in Zirakpur has removed the notice that directed pet parents to not use lifts for their pets. The resident welfare association had put up the notice last week, which drew a lot of criticism from animal welfare activists.

The notice stated that lifts were meant to be used by the residents only and anyone using them for thier pets will be fined Rs 1,000.

""The lifts installed are meant for residents only. Dogs are not allowed in lifts. It has been observed that almost daily pets urinate in lift cars, which spreads foul smell. All are requested to avoid such type of nuisance. If any resident is caught, he/she will be fined Rs 1,000. Cooperation of all is solicited,"" the notice read.

Vikas Luthra, an animal rights activist and a resident of the society, had shared the notice, which attracted public irk on social media.

""No resident welfare association can make such a rule. According to a high court ruling, no association can impose such a fine,"" Luthra said.

The TOI had earlier reported that as per Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) no one can restrict movement of any animal. ""According to AWBI guidelines, RWAs cannot stop pet owners from using lifts. The RWA might not be aware of these rules,"" another animal activist said.

CHANDIGARH: Shortage of funds has further delayed the seven-year-old proposal of replacing CCTV cameras at the Chandigarh railway station.

As many as 35 CCTV cameras keep an eye on the safety and security of passengers at the railway station. But they have a poor quality of recording. Sources said they are running on outdated technology.

Gurinder Mohan Singh, divisional railway manager, Ambala, said the division is facing a fund crunch. He said the division is aware that CCTV cameras are outdated and need immediate replacement. He said other departments were asked if they could transfer the funds but they have yet to get back.

The station improvement group (SIG) of the security department had drafted a proposal for new CCTV cameras and baggage scanner. The proposal includes metal detectors at entry and exit points on both Chandigarh and Panchkula side of the station. On Chandigarh side, a baggage scanner has been installed.

In 2017, the Ambala division sought a budget for hi-tech CCTV cameras, baggage scanner, lift and accelerators but the railway board did not give nod to the proposal. Later, the RPF on their own prepared a proposal and sought funds from the divisional railway manager, Ambala for installation of CCTV cameras.

Recently, the Northern Railway had told the Ambala division that they should hire a contractor who can install and maintain cameras. Members of the railway protection force (RPF) would be deployed to monitor the premises.

A plan was drafted for the installation of cameras at 25 spots, such as entry and exit points, at the end of platforms, circulating area and near booking counter at the station. But the work is yet to start.

MUMBAI: As many as 87 pubs, discotheques and orchestra bars across the city were ordered shut by the fire department last year for violating fire safety norms. Last year also saw the fire brigade receiving overall 5,4217 fire calls—at all places, including residential and commercial-—from Mumbai, a rise of nearly 13% compared to 2018.

The fire brigade had inspected 402 drinking establishments with fire NOC and found 115 of them violating the norms. The inspections were part of the special drive launched following the December 2017 Kamala Mills blaze that claimed 14 lives.

Explaining the drive, an official they want to ensure that drinking establishments do not compromise on safety. The fire brigade started compliance units at the local level, with officials conducting frequent inspections of such establishments as well as residential buildings for fire-fighting and other safety systems. If the fire brigade finds violations, they issue notices to the establishment to make their premises fire compliance, failure of which leads to serious action.

A fire officer said, “Such places are normally dark and have high footfalls. In case of a disaster on such premises, casualty can be very high. So, we insist that such places should be fire compliant. They should take precautions for the safety of people or we will not allow them to function.”

The fire department has given NOC to 411 orchestra bars, discotheques and pubs, including those in five star hotels—121 of them are in Bandra-Andheri belt.

About the overall number of fire calls they received, an official said 2019 saw the most calls in the last three years. Last year, fire brigade received 22 serious calls —level III and IV—compared to 20 in 2018. In 2017, the fire brigade received 26 serious calls and one Brigade Call (highest level)—the Kamala Mills case.

Kolam in front of house against CAA, NRC (File photo)

CHENNAI: The city police commissioner on Wednesday said his officers were probing the alleged Pakistan links of a woman activist booked for anti-CAA kolam protests after one of her social media accounts mentioned her as being part of an organisation based in that country.

A K Viswanathan told reporters the Facebook profile of Gayatri Kandhadai, one of those booked, says she is a researcher for Bytes For All (B4A), Pakistan, part of The Association of All Pakistan Citizen Journalists (AAPCJ) based in Pakistan. She was among eight people who held the innovative protest by drawing kolam (rangoli) before they were arrested and detained at a wedding hall on December 29. They were later released.

A few organisations like the Welfare Party of India, Arappor Iyakkam and Campus Front of India support her. ""We will probe the level of her links with Pakistan,"" the commissioner said.

The website of Bytes for All (B4A), Pakistan says it is a human rights organisation and a research think tank with a focus on information and communication technologies. It organises discussions on relevant topics, presents findings, mobilises opinion.

On the eight people being booked, Viswanathan said no permission was issued to them to protest against CAA and NRC. ""Police did not interfere until an issue was created. A protester drew the anti-CAA messages despite opposition from a houseowner,"" he said and showed a video of a nonagenarian saying anti-CAA messages were drawn before his house without his permission.

Later, incensed at the arrest of the protesters, DMK leaders and partymen drew similar kolams in front of their houses.

Protests, meanwhile, continued across Tamil Nadu . At midnight on Tuesday, as many as 200 activists decided to go on a procession from Panagal Maligai to Raj Bhavan when police stopped them. They raised slogans for nearly an hour and dispersed. In Nagapattinam, more than 2,000 people took out a rally on Wednesday demanding that the Centre revoke CAA. The procession, led by Nagappattinam MLA Thamimun Ansari and Kilvelur DMK MLA U Mathivanan, got participation from others parties. In Trichy, police booked members of Makkal Adhikaram, who were also holding an anti-CAA protest, for unlawful assembly.

Sydney, Jan 2 (AFP) Australia and New Zealand cricketers will pay tribute to firefighters and bushfire victims during the third Test in Sydney, officials said Thursday, as they prepare for possible delays if air quality plummets due to smoke. At least 18 people have lost their lives in one of Australia's most devastating bushfire seasons which has seen blazes raging across the country, including on the outskirts of Sydney. The match, starting Friday, will go ahead but play will be suspended at the umpire's discretion, should smoke significantly affect air quality or visibility. Saturday is shaping as of most concern, when another heatwave is expected to sweep across the country and create dangerous fire conditions. ""Like rain, the rules are in place to add time, to suspend play (for Tests). But what we're finding is it (smoke) comes in quick but also goes quick,"" Cricket Australia's head of operations Peter Roach told cricket.com.au. ""It's unlikely, we believe, it'll be there for a full day. ""We might see some challenges across that day, but we'll play it like rain or adverse weather. Time can be added on."" Before play on Friday both sides will take part in a minute's applause for fire and emergency services workers and wear black armbands as a mark of respect for those who have died. Cricket Australia also announced a fundraising drive for the Australian Red Cross Disaster Relief and Recovery Fund during one-day matches between Australia and New Zealand in Sydney in March. ""On behalf of Australian cricket, we wish everyone fighting the fires across Australia a safe New Year,"" Australia coach Justin Langer and captain Tim Paine said in a joint letter published in local media Thursday. ""We pray the conditions improve, the fires ease and the rains come. And, above all else, we hope all Australians pull together and help each other through this incredibly difficult time."" The issue of smoke is a difficult one for cricket officials, who currently rely on a mix of air quality guidelines from the International Cricket Council, state governments and the Australian Institute of Sport. But there are inconsistencies on what is considered ""unsafe"". A Big Bash League match in Canberra was abandoned this month because of toxic bushfire haze, but several have been played in Sydney since the season began two weeks ago.

NEW DELHI: There’s disappointment in store for those who looked forward to a 360-degree view of Delhi from the observatory deck atop Signature Bridge. Delhi government sources disclosed that the two inclined and two vertical elevators facilitating access to the four-storey viewers’ gallery were not capable of handing the expected rush of visitors.The viewers’ gallery is located at a height of 154 metres, twice that of the Qutab Minar. The gallery has a façade of thick glass which can be expected to get very hot at peak summer and this was another challenge for the government in its plan to haul people up for a bird’s-eye view of the capital.Though Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC), the agency executing the project, is working on some “modifications” in the design including widening of staircases to make them more spacious, officials privy to the status of the project said the final decision on whether the deck will be opened to the public lies with the political leadership.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also in charge of tourism department, did not respond to repeated attempts to contact him on the issue.Constructed at a cost of Rs1,518 crore, Signature Bridge was conceived of in 2004 and approved by the Sheila Dikshit government in 2007. It took more than 11 years for its inauguration in 2018, with the viewing deck and the glass façade taking another year for completion.The triangular-shaped inclined lifts go up 70 metres. These are connected with the second set of vertical lifts with three flight of stairs. The vertical lifts then travel up 60 metres to reach the four-level observatory deck, which has spiral staircases. This design makes the elevators very slow and it takes around four minutes for visitors to reach the observatory deck.“Due to the peculiar design, space constraint and slow speed of the elevators, some people may feel claustrophobic inside. The system may not get safety certificates from the fire and labour departments,” said an official. Trial runs of the four elevators are currently in progress.The elevators currently have simple fans though provisions for air-conditioning are being made, said sources. The elevators can accommodate four passengers at a time while the viewers’ gallery has a capacity for 50 people.The government contemplated building another tower with a bullet lift parallel to the existing structure and connect it with the observatory deck. “We had a discussion with the German consultant who oversaw the original structure, but he shot down the proposal,” revealed an official.DTTDC, however, is continuing the work to illuminate the bridge, pylons and steel cables. A separate agency has been hired to install theme lighting, the pattern of which will change as appropriate to national festivals. The lighting is likely to be inaugurated in the next few days.The construction agency is also connecting the sidewalk of the bridge with the parking area through a 300-metre walkway on the western side. The parking bay, which can accommodate 100 vehicles, also has an open-air plaza, eateries, play zone for children and public conveniences.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064327,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-117087,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-you-may-not-get-birds-eye-view-of-delhi-from-height-of-154m/articleshow/73064203.cms

London, Jan 2 (AFP) Mikel Arteta got everything he asked for in his first win as Arsenal manager with a rampant first 45 minutes from the Gunners earning a 2-0 victory over Manchester United at the Emirates. Nicolas Pepe and Sokratis Papastathopoulos scored the goals to secure just a second win in 16 games. Arsenal started the game three times as many points off the top four as the relegation zone, but a first home win in 87 days hauls Arteta's men up to 10th and within four points of United in fifth. ""I am very pleased with the performance, I'm even more pleased with the result,"" said Arteta after his third game in charge. ""Everything I wanted to see on the pitch, I saw tonight."" There were signs of encouragement for Arsenal in Arteta's home debut against Chelsea on Sunday when only a late collapse saw a 1-0 lead turn into a 2-1 defeat. However, this time the hosts saw the game through as a dismal United performance raised fresh questions over their chances of finishing in the top four. ""At the moment we are suffering to maintain that level of intensity of the first halves,"" added Arteta. ""That will come, but as well I really liked the resilience they showed. I liked to see them suffer together."" Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men were again shorn of Paul Pogba, who faces another month out after an operation on a troublesome ankle injury that has kept him out for the majority of the season. Pogba's absence is still evident in United's inability to create when denied the chance to counter-attack and they failed to recover after falling behind early on. ""After they scored the first goal, it seemed like they got loads of energy,"" said Solskjaer. ""They were the better team. They were aggressive, they regained the ball and it was hard to get the ball off them."" For the first time Arsenal started with all of Pepe, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette and Mesut Ozil together in attack and Arteta's bold choice paid dividends eight minutes in. Pepe scored just his second Premier League goal from open play since a �72 million move from Lille when he swept home Sead Kolasinac's cross at the back post. The Ivorian was suddenly brimming with confidence as he twisted and turned Luke Shaw before crossing for Aubameyang to volley just over. Lacazette then rolled Harry Maguire easily in a night to forget for the world's most expensive defender before pulling his shot across goal. David de Gea is another of United's more experienced stars suffering an alarming dip in form and a poor clearance from the Spaniard offered another sight of goal to Pepe, whose long-range strike came back off the post. Arsenal's first half dominance was rewarded with a second goal before the half-time interval as De Gea could only palm Lacazette's header from a corner back into the danger area and Sokratis pounced to fire into the roof of the net. As the hosts' energy levels dipped from a frantic first 45 minutes, United were allowed to dictate the game but did not have the guile to make their possession count. Andreas Pereira had the best chance to give United a lifeline but fired into the side-netting from Nemanja Matic's clever reverse pass. ""We have to be honest and admit physically we are not ready, but you have to show heart and this team is ready to change a lot of things,"" said Arsenal defender David Luiz.

NEW DELHI: The conductor of a Rajasthan Roadways bus was killed after the vehicle overturned while coming down the flyover in front of Hyatt hotel in south Delhi on Wednesday morning. The fire department received a call around 7am. Police said that the driver of the vehicle and some passengers had fled the spot.

The deceased was identified as Vijay Singh Barala (25) who hails from Rajasthan. “Three fire tenders were rushed as soon as we got a call. The firemen pulled out the conductor, who succumbed to his injuries at the hospital,” said Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service.

A police officer said that the bus was coming from Jaipur to New Delhi. “The final destination was Sarai Kale Khan. A case of rash and negligent driving and death due to negligence has been registered,” he said. “Efforts are on to nab the bus driver.”

Representative image

AURANGABAD: A young male collared tiger from Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary lived in the area around the worldfamous Ajanta Caves and stayed for about eight days before heading towards Dnyanganga sanctuary in Buldhana district .

The collared tiger C1, moved within a two-km radius of the world heritage site in Fardapur and Soyegaon areas around Ajanta caves. An alert about its presence was sent to the forest department in Aurangabad by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII). WII, in collaboration with forest department, has taken up long-term monitoring studies of tigers and in March 2019 had installed radio collars on a couple of them.

Citing information received from WII, forest department officials said the tiger entered the area sometime after December 15 and stayed till December 25, before starting its journey towards Dnyanganga sanctuary on December 26. Deputy forest conservator Satish Wadkar confirmed that the tiger was within a two-km radius of Ajanta caves and Fardapur between mid-December and December 25.

Authorities say they kept the news of C1’s movements under wraps to ensure that no panic-like situation arose since the world heritage monument is visited by many domestic and foreign tourists every day. They also wanted to ensure the wild cat’s safety and security.

Forest officials were relieved to see the three-year-old tiger leave the area without accident. “The tiger preyed only on wild animals in the jungle patches and did not head towards human settlements and farms during his stay here. Any man-animal conflict around the world heritage site would have attracted negative publicity for the wild cat, which we seriously do not want,” said a forest official.

“To ensure that it is not bothered or disturbed, we had decided to keep the development under wraps,” said a senior forest official, who was part of the team that camped in Ajanta at night. As a precautionary measure, teams of the forest department, armed with guns loaded with tranquillizers, were deployed in and around Ajanta and Fardapur jungle to respond to any reports of man-animal conflict.

Forest officials said the tiger originally belongs to Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary and since leaving it on June 23, 2019, has travelled well over 1,700 km.

Southampton, Jan 2 (AP) Tottenham is waiting to find out the extent of Harry Kane's hamstring injury after the striker left Southampton's stadium on crutches after a 1-0 loss at Southampton on Wednesday. Kane picked up the problem in the process of scoring an offside goal, sparking fears he could be set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines. ""For Harry to come out is negative,"" Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho said. ""Hamstring is always a negative. Is it tear? Is it a spasm? Is it a contraction? In this moment I cannot say."" Kane was not the only player Spurs lost to injury as Tanguy Ndombele limped off in the first half and it caused Mourinho to lose his patience. The France midfielder has been beset by fitness concerns following his summer move from Lyon and recently told his manager that he did not want to be selected for the Boxing Day win over Brighton. Mourinho did not hold back in his assessment of the club's record signing, who was brought in by previous manager Mauricio Pochettino. ""He is always injured, he is injured, is not injured,"" Mourinho said. ""He plays one match, the next week he is injured, he plays another match. We are full of hopes and this is since the beginning of the season. ""Of course it is a concern, you think you have a player, you think the player is in an evolution process, he plays very well against Norwich, you think today he is ready for it and he is not ready for it.

London, Jan 2 (AFP) Arsenal rang in the new year by giving boss Mikel Arteta his first victory as lacklustre Manchester United crashed to a 2-0 defeat, while Tottenham and Chelsea also slipped up in the Premier League's top four race on Wednesday. Arteta had watched Arsenal take only one point from his first two matches, with last weekend's 2-1 defeat against Chelsea especially painful after the Blues scored twice in the final minutes. But Arsenal had played well for long periods in that London derby and they produced an even more sparkling display to put United to the sword at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners took the lead in the eighth minute when Sead Kolasinac's cross ran through to Nicolas Pepe at the far post and the Ivory Coast winger beat David De Gea from close-range. Arsenal, who last won in the league at West Ham on December 9, got a deserved second goal in the 43rd minute when De Gea kept out Alexandre Lacazette's flick and Sokratis reacted quickest to lash home. Arteta's team are nine points adrift of the top four, but their second win in 16 matches in all competitions offers hope of a brighter future under the former Arsenal midfielder's management. ""It feels great, incredible. I'm so happy and proud of the players,"" Arteta said. ""Physically the level dropped in the second half but the commitment and desire was terrific. ""The performances are getting better so I was desperate for the win and we got it."" United are fifth, five points behind fourth placed Chelsea, after the latest in a long list of underwhelming performances in a troubled campaign. ""We started decent the first five or six minutes, didn't capitalise, and then they played really well,"" United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said. ""We were too slow in the first half, but that's credit to them. Some tired heads maybe."" Chelsea remain in pole position to secure the fourth Champions League qualification place but manager Frank Lampard will rue conceding a spectacular late equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Brighton. Cesar Azpilicueta gave Chelsea the lead, tapping in from close-range in the 10th minute. But Brighton scored the goal their persistence deserved in the 84th minute when Iranian substitute Alireza Jahanbakhsh acrobatically found the bottom-left corner with an overhead kick. ""It was frustrating for different reasons,"" Lampard said. ""We weren't ruthless enough. We got the goal and we had the possession. But we just didn't kill the game off."" Those dropped points gave Jose Mourinho's Spurs the chance to crank up the pressure on Chelsea and United, but they slipped to a 1-0 defeat at Southampton and England captain Harry Kane limped off with a hamstring injury. - Spurs unravel - ================= Tottenham fell behind to a 17th-minute Danny Ings goal and Kane injured himself as he converted Christian Eriksen's free-kick in the second half but was flagged offside. Mourinho's frustration boiled over as he was shown a yellow card after an altercation with the Southampton bench. ""I was rude,"" Mourinho said. ""I clearly deserved the yellow card. I had bad words."" Elsewhere at the top of the table, second-placed Leicester cruised to a 3-0 win at Newcastle and Manchester City beat Everton 2-1 to hand Carlo Ancelotti his first defeat since taking over as manager. Leicester appear to have put a mini-slump behind them, courtesy of goals from Ayoze Perez, James Maddison and Hamza Choudhury to move to within 10 points of leaders Liverpool. City remain in third after their home win against Everton, a single point behind Leicester. Gabriel Jesus scored twice in the second half at the Etihad before Richarlison pulled a goal back for Everton but City held on despite some nervy moments. ""This period is so tough. When you are far away from the first position sometimes people give up, but we never give up,"" City boss Pep Guardiola said. Struggling West Ham made a flying start under Moyes, returning to the London Stadium for a second stint as manager, hammering hapless Bournemouth 4-0 and lifting themselves out of the relegation zone, with the visitors now in the bottom three. Watford continued their impressive run under new manager Nigel Pearson, holding on to beat seventh-placed Wolves 2-1. Villa beat Burnley 2-1 with first-half goals from Wesley and Jack Grealish while Norwich drew 1-1 with Crystal Palace.

451,['2/01/2020'],Thomas set to tee it up at first PGA Tour event of 2020,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Los Angeles, Jan 2 (AFP) Justin Thomas' all-around game has made him one of the hottest players on the PGA Tour and the American will try to carry that momentum into this week's Tournament of Champions, the first event of 2020. Thomas, Dustin Johnson and Jon Rahm are the headliners for the event as the tour returns from a December hiatus at the par-73 Plantation Course in Kapalua, Hawaii. The field, which consists of only those who won on the tour last year, includes just 34 golfers after several notable winners decided to skip the no-cut event. Top-ranked Brooks Koepka is out with a left knee injury while Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods also qualified but opted not to play, as did Justin Rose, Francesco Molinari and British Open champion Shane Lowry. That sets the stage for Thomas to take advantage. Thomas said his goal for 2020 is to get back to the world number one ranking. ""All the motivation I need to get to number one in the world is in myself,"" he said. ""I don't need to try to prove anybody wrong. ""I don't need to do it because people said I can't. Because I want to be there is big enough motivation for me."" The 26-year-old Thomas, one of only 10 players in PGA history to shoot a sub-60 round, won the BMW Championship in August, finished fourth at the Safeway Open in September and won the CJ Cup in October. Thomas also did well at the Presidents Cup in Australia last month, finishing with a record of 3-1-1, his loss coming in the singles competition. The 2017 PGA Championship winner, Thomas has a burning desire to put together a complete season and get off to a strong start after last year was interrupted by a nagging right wrist injury. ""Yeah, I could have been a pity party and asked for more attention, but I definitely didn't deserve anything special,"" said Thomas, who has qualified for this event four of the past five years. ""I mean, I hadn't done what I had the year before and definitely not two years before that. ""Even with the injury happening, I tried to stay patient, and I was glad to see it kind of come back to how it felt at the end of the year."" Thomas will have competition from world number three Rahm, who is the top-ranked player in the field. Spain's Rahm has three wins and 10 top-10s in his past 13 starts worldwide, vaulting him to a career-high ranking. Johnson is making his first start of the 2019-20 season and has seven consecutive top-10 finishes in the event. Defending champion Xander Schauffele overcame a five-shot deficit entering the final round last year by posting a tournament-record 62 on Sunday. He is trying to become the first player since Geoff Ogilvy (2009-10) to repeat as champion.

MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday launched a mobile application, MANI (Mobile Aided Note Identifier), to aid visually impaired persons in identifying the denomination of currency notes.The app, which can be freely downloaded from Android Play Store and iOS App Store , was launched by RBI governor Shaktikanta Das. Once installed, the app can be used to scan all currency notes of Mahatma Gandhi series (new and old).Once the note is scanned, the app will cause the phone to buzz and the user will get an audio notification in Hindi as well as English. The app can be used in offline mode without internet connectivity.""Indian banknotes contain several features which enable the visually impaired to identify them, viz., intaglio printing and tactile mark, variable banknote size, large numerals, variable colour, monochromatic hues and patterns,"" RBI said in a statement. ""Technological progress has opened up new opportunities for making Indian banknotes more accessible for the visually impaired, thereby facilitating their day to day transactions,"" it added.The app is designed to help those with only visual or visual and hearing disability using the vibration mode. For those who are hearing impaired as well, the user can detect the note by checking the number of vibrations which increase with the denomination. For instance, for a ten-rupee note the phone will buzz twice. This will increase progressively up to eight times for a 2,000 note.RBI has been taking several initiatives to improve accessibility to those with disabilities. Earlier RBI had asked banks to to offer banking facilities including cheque book facility/operation of ATM/locker to the visually challenged as they are legally competent to contract.This followed a 2005 order by the Court of Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities which said that the visually impaired persons cannot be denied a cheque book facility.Indian Banks' Association, in turn, had framed operational guidelines for implementation of its member banks on providing banking facilities.

London, Jan 2 (AFP) Paul Pogba will undergo surgery on a recurring ankle injury and is expected to spend another month on the sidelines, Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer confirmed after his side's 2-0 defeat to Arsenal on Wednesday. The French World Cup winner made his comeback after nearly three months out in a 2-0 defeat at Watford 10 days ago and also made an appearance off the bench in a 4-1 thrashing of Newcastle four days later. ""We've had scans and it's nothing major, it's something that has to be sorted and dealt with. He's been advised to it as soon as,"" said Solskjaer. Pogba has made just six starts in all competitions for United this season and his influence in midfield has been badly missed with United sitting fifth in the Premier League. His latest setback comes at a bad time for Solskjaer with Scott McTominay also sidelined for two months leaving the Norwegian extremely short on midfield options. ""It's a big blow that Paul is out now that Scott's out, he'll be out for a few months. Paul will be back within a month."" Speculation also surrounds Pogba's future at Old Trafford after he expressed a desire to leave the club before the start of the season. Real Madrid reportedly remain interested in the man who cost United a then world record �89 million ($117 million) in 2016, but no move is expected to be made in the January transfer window. And Solskjaer denied suggestions it is Pogba's own medical team rather than the club's which has suggested to undergo surgery at this time. ""We look after our players' health,"" added Solskjaer.

GURUGRAM: A 50-year-old man from Jaipur died and three others were injured in the early hours of Wednesday after the SUV they were travelling in rammed a divider and overturned on NH-8 in Manesar. The crash occurred after a speeding heavy goods vehicle brushed past the SUV while overtaking it, causing the latter to lose balance. The driver of the lorry has been booked.

Mohammad Salim was headed to Delhi to trace his 21-year-old daughter, who had allegedly eloped with a youth last month. Police said they tracked her mobile phone to Delhi.

Prakash Javadekar

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming assembly polls in Delhi, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday once again blamed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Congress for violence during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

Union minister and BJP’s Delhi election incharge Prakash Javadekar alleged that the leaders of the two parties incited the violence instead of condemning it.

“AAP and Congress are responsible for the violence during protests against CAA in Delhi. The parties have maintained silence and did not condemn violence and their people incited it,” Javadekar alleged. He added that the upcoming polls in Delhi were going to be a contest of “nationalism versus anarchy” and “truth versus falsehood”.

Javadekar also named the functionaries of the two parties from Muslim-dominated assembly constituencies of “misleading” the minority community.

Both the AAP and Congress rubbished Javadekar’s charges and hit back at BJP.

Senior AAP leader and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that the party known for spreading violence was accusing other political parties of it. “We have said it umpteen number of times that the AAP condemns any form of violence,” he said. “Leaders of BJP have been reiterating the same statement like a tape recorder because they have no real issue to contest the assembly elections in the capital.”

Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra said that BJP was “rattled” by the “solid position” of his party ahead of the polls and hence was levelling baseless allegations. “Congress never endorses violence in any form, while everyone knows the history of BJP. Congress opposes the CAA but only supports peaceful and democratic protests against it,” Chopra said.

Exuding confidence that BJP will win the upcoming polls, Javadekar said that the saffron party will contest the elections with “positive” mindset and achieve “complete development” of Delhi.

“Modi government has initiated several schemes for the people of Delhi, which we will present to the electorate in the upcoming elections.

We will also share our vision for the next five years and expose the failures of AAP government,” the Union minister said.

On the issue of party’s CM face for the upcoming polls, Javadekar said nothing had been decided. “BJP takes right decision at the right time as per strategy. As soon as we take any decision about this, we will inform you,” he said. He added that the party will start selecting candidates for the 70 assembly seats “soon”.

461,['2/01/2020'],Rishad Premji: Wipro's Rishad Premji may lose executive chairman role due to new Sebi rules,"Rishad Premji (File photo)

BENGALURU/MUMBAI: Wipro’s Rishad Premji may cease to continue as the company’s chairman in an executive role if Sebi’s guidelines on segregation of the positions of chairman and CEO/managing director in the top 500-listed companies comes into effect on April 1.Wipro had submitted a proposal to markets regulator Sebi, seeking its permission to allow Rishad to continue in an executive role following a transition that was on expected lines and was set in motion after his father and former chairman Azim Premji stepped down from his executive role last year.After the transition, the senior Premji was designated founder-chairman and was reappointed to Wipro’s board as non-executive director for a period of five years. TOI had reported previously that once Sebi’s new rules are implemented, it will be one of the rare instances where the promoter family — despite enjoying a 74% shareholding in the company — will play no role in the day-to-day affairs running of the IT blue chip.Sources said that Sebi had communicated to Wipro that since Rishad, despite being the chairman of the board will also play an executive role in the company, the structure will not meet the regulator’s rule to segregate the roles of chairman and CEO ‘in letter and spirit’.The new rule mandates that the chairperson of the board must be a non-executive director. It was first proposed in 2017 by Sebi’s committee on corporate governance, headed by leading banker Uday Kotak. The basis of the new rule is to segregate the board of a listed company from its management. In 2018, Sebi made it a rule and gave top 500 listed companies (by market capitalisation) two years to move to the new structure, which will be effective April 1.When TOI reached out to Wipro, its spokesperson clarified that in July, founder-chairman Azim was reappointed to the board of Wipro as a non-executive director for a period of five years, but reiterated, “Wipro will abide by all applicable regulatory norms.”In its annual report for fiscal 2019, Wipro said that as and when the amended regulation relating to appointment of non-executive chairman by listed entities come into effect, “Rishad A Premji will cease to perform any executive role in the company and continue in the capacity of non-executive director of the company, such that the company remains compliant with the listing regulations in force at all times”.Although Azim has committed 67% of Wipro’s stake to his philanthropic foundation, the family continues to have the voting rights on these shares.However, Shriram Subramanian, founder & MD of proxy advisory services InGovern Research Services, spoke of another possible scenario. Since there’s growing clamour among some corporates not to separate the roles of chairman and MD, “in this background, two emerging possibilities are Rishad becoming the company’s non-executive chairman or taking the role of a joint MD after giving up his executive chairman role,” he said.The junior Premji has done multiple gigs at Wipro. From a quiet backroom operator, he rose through the ranks to become its chairman. Over the years, he headed investor relations and corporate affairs, and then as its chief strategy officer was instrumental in aligning Wipro’s strategy with the future needs of the business. Early on in his tenure, Rishad was credited with spearheading the integration of Citi Technology Services following Wipro’s acquisition of Citibank’s captive technology arm. Citi is one of Wipro’s top customers in the BFSI space. He is also credited with setting up Wipro Ventures, the company’s $100-million corporate VC arm that backs startups developing solutions that could complement Wipro’s businesses in future.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064548,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-68326,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wipros-rishad-premji-may-lose-executive-chairman-role-due-to-new-sebi-rules/articleshow/73064507.cms

463,['2/01/2020'],"Mumbai: To escape traffic smokehouse, foreign schools branch out","This story is from January 2, 2020

The American School of Bombay’s main campus at BKC.

MUMBAI: One city, awful traffic equals multiple campuses. Mumbai’s road congestion has impelled one of the city’s most elite schools to set up branches across the metropolis. The idea is not to up its student intake, but to allow the existing community to simply walk to school.

This academic year, the American School of Bombay (ASB) travelled closer for residents of north Mumbai. With their headquarters in BKC and a campus for juniors in Kurla , the consulate school started a facility in Powai . This is the second foreign school in the Knowledge Park with the Japanese School also moving from Worli to Powai. Soon, more centres will come up in other parts of Mumbai.

To beat the city’s traffic and promote diversity in the class, ASB, which runs a three-hour school for its lowest sections, decided to open the satellite campus, replete with a library, a learn-to-swim indoor pool, a sensory spa, and a live kitchen-canteen. The Powai centre currently has about 20 children, but given the area’s large expat community, the number is likely to grow.

ASB, which largely caters to expats and a floating foreign population, was recently permitted by the external affairs ministry to open its doors to locals too. About 6% of its student population is now Indian.

“We see ourselves as being a five-campus school in the next two years,” said principal Craig Johnson. After the Powai campus came up, residents of Juhu and south Mumbai have pressed for setups in their respective neighbourhoods. Even the initiation of the Powai school lay in parents speaking to the authorities about the time taken to travel from home to school and back. “It started with parents discussing the matter with us last year. We realized that travel time was too much for our students attending the early childhood classes,” said ASB’s COO, Alok Parashar.

Currently, the ASB Powai Learning Village, as it is called, is an early childhood campus catering to pre-K3, pre-K4 and kindergarten students. “However, if we get a request from parents to add a year or two, we will do so too,” said Parashar.

<p>Pakistan army chief General Bajwa<br></p>

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan government in an emergency meeting on Wednesday approved amendments to the Army Act, nearly four weeks after it assured the Supreme Court of passing a legislation on the extension and reappointment of an Army chief within six months.

Prime Minister Imran Khan had extended army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa 's tenure through a notification on August 19. However, on November 26, the Supreme Court suspended the government order, citing irregularities in the manner the army chief, a close confidant of the prime minister, was granted an extension.

On November 28, Bajwa got a six-month conditional extension from the apex court, ending an unprecedented legal wrangle that shook the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government and pitted the powerful military against the judiciary.

Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, who headed a three-member bench, announced the verdict after getting an assurance from the government that Parliament will pass a legislation on the extension/reappointment of an army chief within six months.

In Wednesday's meeting, which was presided over by Prime Minister Khan, the amendments made to the clauses related to the Army chief's tenure and extension were passed unanimously, the Dawn News reported.

The amended Bill will now be presented before the Parliament in order to come into effect.

Though the details regarding the amendments are not yet clear, defence minister Pervez Khattak said it include a proposal to extend the tenure of all the three services chief.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro ’s plan to build an elevated corridor on Mehrauli-Badarpur Road on a single pillar that will have two separate corridors for vehicles and metro is one step closer to reality.Two days after it started construction work on Janakpuri West-RK Ashram Marg corridor under Phase IV, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation awarded the first civil contract for Tughlaqabad-Aerocity corridor, which is 20.2kmlong with 15 stations.While the corridor will connect Violet Line (Kashmere Gate-Raja Nahar Singh) with Airport Express Line, the highlight of this section is a double-decker viaduct that will include the metro viaduct as well as an elevated six-lane flyover from Sangam Vihar to Ambedkar Nagar. The metro viaduct will be on the upper deck at an elevation of 18 metres, while the road flyover will be on the lower deck at 9.3 metres. The total length of the integrated structure will be 2.4km, providing a first-of-akind three-layered transport facility on this section. A 430mlong, six-lane underpass will also be constructed at Saket-G block at Mandir Marg crossing.“Three corridors of Phase IV have so far been approved under which 61.6km of new metro lines will be constructed across three different corridors comprising 45 stations,” Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, said.The first civil contract for the corridor awarded on Wednesday involves construction of a metro viaduct from Sangam Vihar to Saket-G block, including four elevated stations — Sangam Vihar, Khanpur-Devoli, Ambedkar Nagar and Saket-G block.“After construction of this stretch, the Mehrauli-Badarpur Road will be signal-free from Sangam Vihar to Saket. The work will be completed in about three years,” Dayal said.The other two civil contracts awarded for Phase IV corridors include one for construction of 10 stations on Janakpuri West-RK Ashram Marg corridor — Keshopur, Paschim Vihar, Peeragarhi, Mangolpuri, West Enclave, Pushpanjali, Deepali Chowk, Madhuban Chowk, Prashant Vihar and North Pitampura — and another for Maujpur-Majlis Park corridor.

NAGPUR: The year 2019 was almost a perfect one for Malvika Bansod . Fittingly enough, she ended the year with her career-best world ranking of 169 when the Badminton World Federation (BWF) updated the rankings on Tuesday, the last day of 2019.

The 18-year-old took a massive jump of 283 spots to reach 169 from a lowly 452 in the women’s singles world rankings. All this happened in just over three months when she made an international debut in the senior category with her participation in the Maldives International Future Series tournament in September. In addition to that, she has also bagged a lucrative five-year contract with Vishvaraj Infrastructure Ltd (VIL).

The in-form teenager’s spectacular performance was noticed by GoSports Foundation , which has promised to help her in boosting her career.

Malvika is delighted with the latest development and believes it will certainly boost her career in a big way.

“I am grateful to the GoSports Foundation for extending the support. It’s an elite organisation and I am glad that I was chosen by them. I have been selected in a long-term athlete development programme on the basis of my performance in national and international tournaments,” Malvika told TOI on Wednesday.

Currently training at Raipur under the watchful eyes of chief national junior coach Sanjay Mishra, Malvika is aiming for a spot in the senior Indian side sooner than later.

The forthcoming two All India Senior Ranking tournaments at Bengaluru (January 7 to 13) and Goa (January 15 to 20) are the selection trials for the Indian team that will compete in the Asian Badminton Championships next month.

“I want to thank my coach Sanjay Mishra for helping me improve my game in the last few months. I am also thankful to MBA president Arun Lakhani and VIL, without whose support I wouldn’t have played and performed well,” said Malvika, a student of Shivaji Science College.

NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday alleged that BJP was against affordable and quality education and reforms in the sector. “BJP has forced a fourfold increase in the examination fees for the Class X and Class XII students of CBSE. While Delhi government is still committed to bear the full fees of government school students , this move by BJP has imposed a huge financial burden on private school students. These families are not going to forgive BJP,” said Sisodia.On June 22, CM Arvind Kejriwal had announced that Delhi government would pay examination fees for CBSE X and XII, which were Rs 450 for general and Rs 125 for SC/SC students. “This decision was benefitting more than 3.5 lakh students in government schools. BJP thought that this historic decision would affect their politics and hence they got the CBSE to increase the fees on August 2,” claimed Sisodia, adding that the fees were hiked to Rs 1,950 for general and Rs 1,650 for SC/ST students.“BJP should answer why the Delhi BJP forced CBSE to increase the fee four times. The steep hike has affected 6 lakh families of Delhi,” Sisodia said. He added that the AAP-led government paid the fees as promised.Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana, however, rubbished the allegations. “Sisodia and CM Arvind Kejriwal are experts in spreading rumours. Their education model is nothing but a propaganda. They should answer why 2 lakh students dropped out of Delhi government schools in 2019,” Khurana said.BJP leader Vijender Gupta said BJP has nothing to do with the exam fee hike as CBSE is an autonomous body. “The fees were raised after five years. CBSE generates its own funds through the fees of a number of public examinations,” a BJP leader said. CBSE had earlier said the hike was necessary as the board ran on no-profit, no-loss principle.In Video: BJP against affordable education: Manish Sisodia",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064689,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-969543,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-against-affordable-education-says-delhi-deputy-cm-manish-sisodia/articleshow/73064701.cms

If doctors say he cannot travel so long, he will be produced before a judicial magistrate in Trichy. “In either case, we will act on the directions of the magistrate. We will hospitalise him or remand him in jail under judicial custody as they say,” he said.

As he was arrested, BJP workers raised slogans against Kannan while SDPI cadres condemned the arrest. When he was taken out of the guest house, some protesters attempted to throw slippers at him.

On Monday night, the Melapalayam police booked him under Sections 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505(i)(b) (intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the state or against public tranquillity), and 505 (ii) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) of the IPC.

On Tuesday afternoon, Kannan was taken to a private hospital in Tirunelveli as he complained of chest pain. He had to be discharged in an hour as there was a strong protest by BJP cadres on the hospital premises. His family claimed that he will be taken to a hospital in Madurai but maintained confidentiality over the place fearing protest by BJP cadres.

Police said Kannan’s family took him to Madurai on Tuesday and then to Perambalur, where he was arrested due to pressure following the protest by senior BJP functionaries on the Marina on Wednesday. BJP national secretary H Raja, L Ganesan, C P Radhakrishnan and Pon Radhakrishnan along with 100 party workers were arrested for the sit-in protest in front of Gandhi statue on the Marina beach front. They had set a 24-hour deadline for the TN police to arrest him.

Representative image

BENGALURU: ICU stereotypes where patients are seen lying supine may have to change. A 50-year-old woman diagnosed with H1N1 and pneumonia, battling for life and put on ventilator in ICU for three weeks showed improvement after her posture was changed and she was made to lie in a prone (face-down) position.

Prone ventilation made a remarkable difference to the woman from Kuppam in Andhra Pradesh , said her doctors at Manipal Hospital, Whitefield. She has now recovered completely and has returned home.

The change of posture has been proven to be a lifesaving therapeutic measure for many such patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and other lung- related infections. The 32% mortality level in ARDS worldwide can be halved with this technique, said a French study from 2013-14. The practice is now being widely followed in most ICUs.

""It is used as a strategy to improve oxygenation when traditional modes of ventilation fail. In case of ARDS and H1N1 leading to pneumonia, the infection is largely in the posterior side of the lungs. If the anterior side gets oxygenated well, the recovery is faster,"" says Dr Rajesh Mohan Shetty, chief of clinical services, lead consultant, department of critical care medicine, Manipal Hospitals, Whitefield.

The method is gaining popularity now - especially on patients with H1N1 - seen largely during the winter season. At government-run Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), doctors said prone ventilation is a life saver for many patients. ""Every day, it's used for at least one or two ARDS patients,"" says Dr C Nagaraj, director, RGICD. .

However, Dr Sandeepa HS, consultant pulmonologist, St Martha's hospital said prone ventilation cannot be used on all patients. ""It is not used on pregnant women, patients suffering from myocardial infarction (heart attack) and those with long -standing lung infections. But it is very effective on patients with H1N1 who develop ARDS,"" Dr Sandeepa said.

Prone ventilation is administered in 3-4cycles, and in some cases, the cycles last up to 16 hours each depending on the severity of the infection. Though the treatment cost does not vary for prone position, it requires a minimum of two doctors and three nurses to change the position.

""Since the time i moved to Bengaluru 50 years ago, I have seen New Year celebrations are limited only to MG Road and Brigade Road. This may be the reason why some ugly incidents, like women getting mobbed or molested, are reported,"" the Govindarajanagar MLA said.

""I have also noticed the same kind of revellers congregate at Brigade Road and the miscreants having a pattern. We can have an arrangement to organise New Year bash in different locations. This way, even people from other parts of Bengaluru can take part in celebrations and return home safely, while personnel will be in a better position to manage any situation,"" the senior BJP leader added.

477,['2/01/2020'],Future is trying on your clothes virtually: Experts,"This story is from January 2, 2020

BENGALURU: If the last decade transformed your shopping experience — ordering in from the comforts of your home using smartphones, or during a short break at work — the next decade will see technology change the way you shop online, besides revolutionising offline spaces.

As industry experts point out, the future of online apparel shopping is trying on clothes virtually, thanks to virtual and augmented reality-powered online and offline shopping spaces.

The digital trial room, as they term it, will require the customers to click a selfie, upload it on the online platform along with their height and weight. These inputs will create their online avatar to showcase how the outfit would fit them.

Abhishek Shetty, head (marketing), PR and loyalty at Celio says: “Online spaces report at least 30% to 40% of returns because of several factors — customers may not receive the right size or may not like how the product looks on them. Virtual trial rooms will help customers and sellers to a great extent.”

Not just this, as Amit Surendra Sawant, associate vice-president (marketing), Future Lifestyle Fashions points out, another technology — Magic Mirrors — will revolutionise brick-andmortar stores with experiential pop-ups and more.

Picture this: You step into a trial room with a bunch of clothes and want to try something similar in a different colour or style. Voila! mirrors turn into screens with a touch and slide option. A list of options pop-up and with just a click, your mirror reflection is now dressed in it!

“We intend to become a fashion experience centre with stores that will change like galleries, entertain like a show and build loyalty like clubs,” Sawant says, adding that technology will give consumers a virtual makeover in the coming years. The quick 360-degree photographs will help customers check-out how they look in a particular outfit from all the angles. Such technology will help salespersons evolve into fashion consultants, he added.

Tapan Acharya, chief revenue officer, Arvind Internet added these fashion consultants will be aided with a treasure of consumer data from online searches and shopping preferences.

Experts say the virtual shopping experience is the future of the presently evolving ‘Omnichannel’ Fashion retail, which is unifying a consumer’s online and offline demand. “If consumers can’t find their choice at the store, but it happens to be on our online platform, it will be delivered home,” Acharya said, adding that Arvind has ‘omnified’ 5,000 such stores across 500 brands in the last two years.

Although some experts bat for virtual reality (VR) technology and artificial intelligence revolutionising the physical shopping spaces in the way they have in China, Shetty says: “It’ll only work as a ‘wow’ factor. Serious consumers might want to try it themselves as they are already in the store rather than watching it on their photoshopped avatar.”

He says such trial rooms will entail massive costs and efforts, which the industry cannot afford now.

Divya Deshmukh

NAGPUR: Teenage chess queen Divya Deshmukh started 2020 as country’s top master. Graduating to the Under-16 age-group last month, the 14-year-old was ranked India's No. 1 in the U-16 girls’ category in the ranking list released by the World Chess Federation ( FIDE ) on Wednesday.

In April last year, for the first time Divya took the top position in the world by becoming No. 1 in the U-14 age category and maintained her numero uno position in the same age-group for the next seven months. She turned 14 in December last month.

With international rating points of 2,322 in her kitty, Divya became U-16 No. 1 in India and is ranked fifth in the world. She is also India No. 1 in the U-18 girls’ group and second among the U-20 players in the country.

From 2,432 Elo in April 2019 to 2322 in the ranking list of January, she has lost as many as 110 Elo points . Losing a handful of rating points, however, cost Divya dearly as she lost the India No. 3 position, behind recently crowned World Rapid Chess Champion Koneru Humpy and Harika Dronavalli. In the women’s open group of Indian players, Divya has dropped to the No. 11 position.

City’s Mrudul Dehankar too jumped two places and is now India No. 3 in the U-16 girls’ group behind Divya and Tamil Nadu’s Rakshitta Ravi.

City’s only Grandmaster Raunak Sadhwani – also placed in the U-16 category after turning 14 last month – is India No. 4 in the U-16 group. With an Elo of 2522 Raunak is behind India’s top junior performers Nihal Sarin, Praggnanandhaa R and Gukesh D in the ranking list.

Similarly, Vidarbha’s third International Master (IM) Sankalp Gupta earned a handful of rating points to take his tally to 2,400 Elo. He is now at the 17th position in the country.

(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: Broadcast regulator Trai has come out with a new tariff regulation, which will enable TV subscribers to access more channels at a lesser price. Trai made amendments to the regulatory framework for cable and broadcasting services and capped at Rs 160 the amount consumers will have to pay monthly for all freeto-air channels.

The regulator said it has decided that in case of multi-TV homes where more than one TV connection is working in the name of one person, it will charge a maximum of 40% of declared Network Capacity Fee (NCF) for the second and additional TV connections.

After examining various provisions, Trai has also reduced the maximum NCF charge to Rs 130 (excluding taxes) for 200 channels. Trai also decided that only those channels that have an MRP of Rs 12 or less will be permitted to be part of the bouquet offered by broadcasters.

In addition, it has also decided that channels declared mandatory by the information and broadcasting ministry will not be counted in the number of channels in the NCF. The authority has also permitted Distribution Platform Operators (DPOs) to offer discounts on long-term subscriptions that are for six months or more.

The sum of the a la carte rates of the pay channels forming part of a bouquet shall in no case exceed one-and-a-half times the rate of the bouquet of which such pay channels are a part, Trai said. The a la carte rates of each pay channel (MRP), forming part of a bouquet, shall in no case exceed three times the average rate of a pay channel of the bouquet of which such pay channel is a part, it further said.

Dismissing a petition filed by HM Vishwanath, a class -1 contractor from Bengaluru, justice B Veerappa has noted that reservation has been provided based on the principles of distributive justice to protect the interests of weaker sections of the society, particularly those belonging to SC-ST category.

In a notification issued on July 17, 2017, the state government provided up to 17.15% reservation for contractors belonging to SC category and up to 6.95% reservation for contractors belonging to ST category, with respect to contracts not exceeding Rs 50 lakhs. For this purpose, the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement Rules ,2016 was amended to insert rule 27 (A). The rules also provide that only in instances wherein no contractor from these two categories submit a response even after two attempts, a contract relating to such works may be tendered among others.

drinking water and playgrounds

What’s worse, the Jarimari Municipal Urdu School in Kurla has no drinking water for 400 students.The world is celebrating stepping into the new year and a new decade but three 20 x 20 feet rooms in the BMC-run Jarimari Municipal Urdu School in Kurla have over 400 students learning a hard lesson sitting on the floor. Established in 1971 in a donated building, the school doesn’t even have drinking water, let alone benches. Frequent power outages in poorly ventilated rooms and a single toilet for students and the staff is not the image an international city would like the world to see.The school houses grades 1to 4, with three divisions each, in the first shift from 7.30 am to 12.30 pm, and three divisions of grade 5 from 12.45 pm to 5.30 pm. All this in just three rooms. L-Ward Administrative Officer (schools) Saile Surve said the acute space crunch forced the BMC to not put benches. “On the floor, we can accommodate 35 students. With benches, the capacity will go down to 20,” she said, adding that the school was established to impart education to the local community and, therefore, can’t decline anyone from the area. “However, benches will force us to restrict the enrolment of students,” Surve said.Although the Jarimari School is not the only Urdu school in the area, teachers say parents from neighbourhood nodes prefer to send their children here for the reasons of proximity. “There are two Urdu primary schools run by the BMC –and– but ours is more popular. Most parents are engaged in household work in this area and like the idea of their children being close by. They fear for their safety and want to be available at all times,” a senior teacher said.The Right to Education (RTE) Act necessitates school infrastructure provisions such as all-weather buildings, a library, separate toilets for boys and girls,. However, the headmistress of the Jarimari School manages to buy only five litres of drinking water every day from the school funds. What she also can’t do anything about is the lack of proper toilet facilities and a library. There’s a common toilet used by both the students and the staff, but its ceiling leaks every monsoon.“It is disheartening to see kids sitting on the floor in the school. I have lodged multiple complaints with the BMC about the dilapidated condition of the building, but all I get is hollow assurances. The authorities have just turned a blind eye to all our problems,” said Imran Quraishi, a local activist.BMC education officer Mahesh Palkar washed his hands off the matter by claiming that the school building is neither owned by nor under the jurisdiction of the BMC, which runs India’s largest primary education network. “It’s a rented building, so we cannot renovate the space. Besides, there is no space in the neighbourhood to construct a new school. We are doing our best with limited resources,” Palkar said.An hour attending a grade 5 class reveals a mutual admiration club of teachers and parents. While the staff can’t praise the students enough, parents say the teachers step out of their comfort zones to impart education to their wards. “The results of our students here are better than the other schools,” said a senior teacher, who was transferred here recently. Until the authorities do something about the basic facilities, they want to pin their hopes on just education.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-1047195,msid-73063022/73063022.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/this-20x20-ft-bmc-urdu-school-in-kurla-has-no-benches-drinking-water-for-400-students/articleshow/73064833.cms

‘State bound by projects as it had cleared them’

PANAJI: After having given a raw deal on the Mhadei issue , Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar has once again ignored Goa’s requests for a meeting to discuss the draft coastal zone management plan (CZMP), 2011.Despite state environment minister Nilesh Cabral sending five letters requesting for an appointment to discuss certain relaxation in norms from the Centre, he has only got acknowledgement of the letters with no sign of a meeting.Goa, which has been given an extension till January 31 by the national green tribunal to submit the coastal plan-—probably the last extension—runs the risk of missing the deadline that can lead to heavy fines and jail term for the state officials.“We have written five letters—the latest was sent on December 24—and I have also met him three times. All we are getting are acknowledgements for our letters,” Cabral said.He said considering Goa’s unique ecosystem, it is necessary for the Centre to make some coastal regulation zone relaxations. “Otherwise, only 257 sq km of the state’s total 3,702 sq km of land will be available for development,” he said.This is because most of the land has already been demarcated under national highways, national parks and wildlife cover, private forests, paddy fields, salt pans, fish farms and other eco-sensitive areas.“Only 257 sq km for development is too little for a population of 15.6 lakh and 80 lakh tourists visiting the state,” Cabral said in his December 24 letter to Javadekar.We want to discuss the pressing and important subject of proposed amendments to the CRZ notification 2011 pertaining to Goa. We have submitted four letters on July 4, October 23 and 31 and again on November 30 in 2019. The latest letter was written on December 24,” said Cabral.For the Centre to relax the norms, Javadekar has to hold a meeting of Goa officials with those from the environment ministry, National Coastal Zone Management Authority and National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management.Cabral said chief minister Pramod Sawant had also briefed Javadekar about the objections raised by the people of Goa to the draft CZMP 2011, during the Union minister’s visit to the state in July 2019.“Goa has granted various clearances prior to the CRZ notification 2011. Based on these clearances, people have invested their hard earned monies to purchase fully approved and developed plots. The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) had also given their consent. Post-2011 notification, the high tide line (HTL) has shifted due to breach of bunds, etc, affecting numerous people,” Cabral had written to Javadekar.Breach in the bunds has meant more land inwards has turned saline, now making CRZ regulations applicable here, and making it a no development zone Cabral told Javadekar that since the state government itself had cleared these projects, it is bound by the principle of ‘promissory estoppel’.“Hence, it is proposed that after Clause 3(xiv) an additional clause be inserted stating that ‘CRZ notification of 2011 shall not be applicable to all such projects for which approvals had already been granted for development of plots prior to the CRZ notification 2011 and the line of HTL shall from such closest of the plot permitted for development’,” Cabral wrote.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73064921,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-754630,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-mhadei-prakash-javadekar-snubs-goa-plea-to-discuss-coastal-plan/articleshow/73064890.cms

Students take part in an Inqui-lab session at a government school in Bengaluru

BENGALURU: When his teacher brought some magnets to the class and asked him to use them however he wants, 10-year-old Arif from a nondescript private budget school in Hyderabad designed a shirt with magnetic buttons for his physically handicapped friend. In yet another government school on the outskirts of Bengaluru, a class 7 student designed a solar iron box for his parents, who run a laundry to enable them save on coal.

Both boys were in the classrooms of a startup - Inqui-lab - that works with government schoolchildren in Bengaluru and Hyderabad and helps them design innovative products. The startup is now being incubated by NSRCEL, the entrepreneurship cell at Indian Institute of Management - Bangalore, as part of its Social Cohort Programme 2019.

Founded by three engineers-turned-Teach for India (TFI) fellows in 2017, Inqui-lab works with students from classes 6-9 in Hyderabad and Bengaluru to help government and budget schools turn hubs of creativity and innovation.

""It all started when one of our co-founders, Eshwar Bandi, took some random objects like magnets and solar panels to a TFI classroom. He was amazed to see the ideas students came up with to solve basic problems they faced in their everyday life. Later, we started doing it in other schools and the phenomena was the same everywhere. We wanted to scale up to make it a project for schools to help students develop their problem-solving sk-ills,"" said Sahithya Anumolu, co-founder, Inqui-lab. Vivek Pidempally is third other co-founder.

Inqui-lab now works with 25 schools, five of which are in Bengaluru. It has a two-year weekly innovation programme that can be adopted by government high schools.

""More than helping students develop and market their products, our focus is on helping them develop these skills and induce creative confidence, design thinking, collaboration and prototyping abilities, which are the future skills,"" said Sahithya.

""We are teachers first and required help to think like entrepreneurs. The training at NSRCEL helped us have a bigger vision,"" she added.

The programme is conducted as part of regular classes in these schools. In Bengaluru, the startup has tied up with Mantra4Change, which implements things on the ground.

""Students love the programme as it's for the first time that they get to work with sensors, solar materials, electrical circuits and other stuff. Unlike in other labs, students here have to ideate and come up with projects which can solve simple problems of their lives,"" said Anu Nayudu, of Mantra4Change.

490,['2/01/2020'],Mumbai: Former ACP’s daughter duped of Rs 19 lakh in online matrimonial fraud,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Representative image

MUMBAI: The daughter of a retired assistant commissioner of police (ACP) from Mumbai was duped of Rs 19 lakh by a conman whom she had met on a matrimonial website. In his profile, the man had identified himself as Mithilesh and said he was vice-president of an e-commerce company based in Delhi, said the police.

Based on the 40-year-old’s victim complaint filed on Tuesday, the Andheri police registered a case under the Indian Penal Code and the IT sections for impersonation and cheating and are trying to trace the suspect through his email address, IP address and bank account where she transferred the money. The victim had never met the accused in person, said a police officer.

The complainant, who is employed with a private firm as a general manager, told the police that after she uploaded her profile on the matrimonial site, she got an email from Mithilesh in February 2019. A police officer said: “The victim got impressed when he told her that he was VP of an e-commerce firm and drew a monthly salary of Rs 1 crore. After gaining her confidence, the fraudster siphoned off money at regular intervals from February to September 2019.”

The complainant said: “In February, Mithilesh called me on my WhatsApp number and proposed. I accepted his proposal, but did not tell my parents about it. He told me that his company was selling a high-end mobile phone at a cheaper price and asked me to tell my colleagues about this scheme. My colleagues transferred money to my account which I then transferred to his bank account, but the phones were never delivered. I have paid him at least Rs 2.7 lakh every month for this discounted mobile phone scheme.”

The police said he even made her transfer money ranging from Rs 100 to Rs 70,000 giving excuses like he forgot his wallet or credit/ debit cards. “The victim finally realised that she had been duped when her colleagues started demanding their money back as they did not get the discounted phones and he kept making avoiding her,” said an officer. She then disclosed the fraud to her parents and approached the Andheri police on Tuesday.

Deenanath Hospital

With the government failing to honour its various health schemes, hospitals have turned averse to entertaining them. After turning the back on patients entitled to Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and Ex-servicemen’s Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS), many city hospitals have walked out on the MaharashtraKutumb Aarogya Yojana (MPKAY).Most big hospitals are no longer part of MPKAY’s empanelled list, which has 20 hospitals earmarked in the district. The police department has piled up dues to the tune of Rs 1.94 crore to, Rs 74 lakh to, Rs 38 lakh toand Rs 36 lakh toin the city, forcing them to refuse cashless treatment to MPKAY beneficiaries.The present empanelled hospitals in the district include only three hospitals in the city to cover 10,000 beneficiaries here, besides four in Pimpri-Chinchwad and 13 in rural fringes. The policemen and their kin are feeling the pinch of the big names missing from the list.They complain that being unable to access these better equipped speciality hospitals is affecting the quality of treatment they can avail, especially in the case of critical illnesses. Those who are compelled to pay from their pockets or borrow to get the necessary treatment from the hospitals no longer on the panel, also find themselves scurrying pillar to post to get their reimbursement from the department.Last month, a police constable with Pune police’s anti-encroachment cell, Ganesh Gawde, has in fact pleaded in a letter to the Chief Minister, Governor, Director General of Police, and other officials, seeking the inclusion of the big hospitals in the panel.“The big hospitals are the ones equipped with advanced machinery and specialist doctors. The current 20 hospitals are unable to match up to the quality they offer and are able to handle critical ailments. Many times, these hospitals refer the patients to the bigger hospitals not empanelled, putting us in a quandary. Those hospitals have to be incorporated in our panel in the interest of the thousands of beneficiaries MPKAY have here,” Gawde urged.An assistant sub-inspector, who did not wish to be identified, has been trying to recover the money he spent on his treatment from his own department for a while, in vain. “I underwent open heart surgery a year ago, at a private hospital not empanelled. My family had to borrow to take care of my hospital bill. Now I am running around trying to extract the reimbursement. I am also fending for my monthly medication, while the chase to recover my money has become frustrating,” he complained.Another havildar with the Pune police is struggling to garner appropriate treatment for a family member diagnosed with tumour. “It’s been more than a week that I’ve been trying to identify where my dependent can be treated. The treatment is costly and available at a hospital that has exited the panel. I really don’t know what to do now. We don’t have the kind of money needed for the treatment. Our savings have been exhausted on the initial treatment and screening,” he pointed out.At Noble, which was the latest to exit MPKAY’s panel, the medical director, Dr Dilip Mane, explained, “The dues are huge, so we stopped working for the scheme two months ago. The dues have piled up over two years and the officers seem reluctant to pay up. We would resume if they start clearing the dues.” Bomi Bhote, chief executive officer of Ruby Hall Clinic echoed, “The cops serve the society so hospitals were empathetic and continued to treat them despite delays in payment. We did not bother about low rates fixed for different procedures. But with dues from other schemes also piling up we were left no option but to discontinue our cashless service. If the dues are taken care of we will only be happy to take them in.”The Pune city police commissioner, K Venkatesham, acknowledged the issue was becoming a problem, and said, “We are tabulating the pending dues to various hospitals and are working towards getting them cleared. But the number of hospitals empanelled for MPKAY has only increased.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-219511,msid-73061617/73061617.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospitals-turn-hostile-to-pmkay-cops-bear-brunt/articleshow/73064913.cms
492,['2/01/2020'],NZealand look to salvage pride in smoky Sydney,"This story is from January 2, 2020

Sydney, Jan 2 (AFP) Smoke haze could come into play as New Zealand look to salvage some pride from their miserable tour of Australia in the third and final Test in Sydney this week. With bushfires raging across New South Wales state, day two of the match on Saturday shapes up as the biggest challenge with temperatures forecast to soar and smoggy conditions expected. The issue of smoke is a difficult one for officials, who currently rely on a mix of air quality guidelines from the International Cricket Council, state governments and the Australian Institute of Sport. But there are inconsistencies on what is considered ""unsafe"", with Cricket Australia and the players' association currently working to develop better protocols around visibility and air quality. It follows a Big Bash League match in Canberra being abandoned this month because of toxic bushfire haze. Currently, it is up to the umpires to decide whether conditions are safe, without any formal framework for that decision. With the first two Tests at Perth and Melbourne ending in heavy defeats inside four days, New Zealand will need all the help they can get. Coach Gary Stead admitted the Black Caps were ""beaten up by Australia again"" in their 247-run Melbourne thrashing and they have had to go back to the drawing board. ""We've got to find some areas where we can keep chipping away, make improvements and put Australia under pressure for longer,"" he said. ""When you get put under pressure for the periods Australia have put us under, then you have to question what we're doing. ""Australia have three bowlers at 145 kph and a spinner (Nathan Lyon) that's taken over 300 Test wickets so you're always up against it. You don't get a reprieve and that's the hard thing for us."" - No let-up - ============= The bright spot from Melbourne was makeshift opener Tom Blundell's gritty second innings century and he is set to retain the role alongside Tom Latham in Sydney. But there is doubt over skipper Kane Williamson, who has had a poor tour. The New Zealand Herald reported that he missed training Wednesday with flu-like symptoms, with batsman Henry Nicholls suffering similar problems. Jeet Raval is the only specialist batsman waiting in the wings, but he has been out of form and was dropped for Melbourne. Australian captain Tim Paine has made clear his team has no intention of easing up now the series has been won, with New Zealand potentially coming under a five-pronged attack in Sydney, starting Friday. Depending on the pitch, they could play two specialist spinners alongside their fast-bowling machine of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson. Leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson, championed by Shane Warne, has been called up to the squad and is keen to make his debut. ""The team's doing really well at the moment and it's going to be a tough team to crack into,"" he said. ""But I'm here and going to be preparing to play. That's the only thing I can do."" New Zealand's task has been that much harder with strike bowler Trent Boult ruled out after a Starc bouncer in Melbourne fractured his non-bowling hand. They have turned to off-spinner Will Somerville, who was raised in Australia, as his replacement. ""The fact he's played a lot of cricket in Sydney during his career for New South Wales will also be helpful as we prepare for this final Test,"" said Stead.

The cheat made the officer scan a QR code and siphoned off the amount from his bank account.The officer lodged an FIR with the Sangvi police on Tuesday. The suspect has been booked under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 419 (punishment for cheating by personation) of the IPC and the relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act.Sub-inspector Vinod Shendkar of the Sangvi police said the complainant was posted in Jammu and Kashmir and his family resided in Pimple Gurav. The major had come to the city a few days ago for holidays. “He placed an advertisement on an online marketplace to sell his old smartphone in the last week of December 2019,” Shendkar said.The major received a call around 10am on December 26 from a person who wanted to buy the smartphone from him. The fraudster told him he would first transfer 50% of the amount online and give the remaining after the phone was delivered. “The fraudster then told the major he would send him a Quick Response (QR) code and told him to scan it, following which the amount would be transferred to the latter’s account,” the sub-inspector said.When the major scanned the code he found out that the fraudster wasn’t sending him money, but was collecting it from his bank account. Within a few seconds, Rs19,500 was debited from the officer’s account. “The officer blocked his bank account and tried to contact the person but his cellphone was not reachable,” Shendkar said.

Sydney, Jan 2 (AFP) Former world number three Grigor Dimitrov saw his ranking slump last year as he struggled with a shoulder injury, but the Bulgarian Thursday said he won't push himself too hard, too fast to return to the top of tennis. The 28-year-old was laid low early in the season and was far from his best after he returned to action, although he did reach the US Open and Paris Masters semi-finals. Dimitrov said 2019, where he failed to win a title, had been ""quite a journey"". ""It's going to be a year that I remember for the rest of my life,"" he said in Sydney ahead of the inaugural ATP Cup team event, his warm-up for the Australian Open Grand Slam. ""Yeah, the body checks out pretty good right now. I'm still monitoring a lot of my work, a lot that I'm going through. ""I kind of pace myself in the right way. I'm not in a rush, which is also a good thing."" The shoulder problem was Dimitrov's first major injury and he said he plans to limit the number of tournaments he plays, particularly early in the season. ""I'm not going to force myself to play too many tournaments early on and really look after the body. That's the number one thing,"" said Dimitrov, now ranked 20. ""Clearly I haven't competed for almost the past four months of the year, and so that itself brought a lot of doubts, and dropping a lot in the ranking and so on.

""It's always been a dream of mine to always be kind of on the other end, and I think to be a coach is never easy. ""I don't know if I'm going to be a good coach.

Question: I’m a deputy to my superior, who doesn’t like to interact with me. Moreover, he assigns work directly to my subordinates, ignoring me. Often, I face an awkward situation when my juniors approach me for guidance on assignments which I have not been informed about. I am tolerating this unpleasant situation for the last five years. When I took my grievance to my boss, he said he is not answerable to me. The management appears helpless. This is frustrating as my chances of getting promoted are being blocked. What shall I do?

This is indeed a difficult spot to be in, and more so because you have been in this position for the last five years. I assume that in these five years, neither you nor your superior have been promoted. Professionally, that is a huge red flag. Before getting into issues which seem to indicate breeding of insecurity, I would be concerned about working under someone who is not progressing in his career. Your acceptance of the situation for five years amounts to professional hara-kiri.The focus should not be around what your superior should or could do, as trying to change his behaviour may not amount to much. What is equally worrisome is that the management seems toothless or lacks a transparent performance mechanism. Is your superior so indispensable that the management has no other option but to look away? Given that both of you seem to be stuck in the same role, it doesn’t seem so.The final issue is around your inability to guide your subordinates, again, on account of your superior.Make an effort to figure out the reason for your superior’s insecurity. Take independent feedback from your superior’s peers and the HR department on what could be possible reasons. Make use of performance management discussions for insights into why your boss is bypassing you.Be self-aware and honest about your performance. Document your achievements or gaps, which might have caused your superior to lose trust in you. Working on these aspects proactively can help approach the situation differently and could elicit a response from your superiors.Apply to internal job postings (if such an option or policy exists), or pitch for a new role under a different leader.Consider this only after options A and B have been exhausted. This will help you explore newer opportunities within the same organisation and give you a chance to grow.If all the options fail, it’s perhaps time to relook at whether you want to continue working in such an organisation. More so because you have given this issue more time than it deserves.However, it would be good to address your inability to help subordinates or guide them, irrespective of the behaviour of your superior towards you. You could continue to command the respect of your team by successfully establishing yourself as a leader whom they can trust and learn from. It would be good to reflect on this and work towards mending ways for the future.Are you dealing with a tough boss? Are your colleagues being mean to you?

I usually visit Hesaraghatta Lake and Magadi Lake for birdwatching. I never go alone. I prefer visiting the lakes with my friends between October and February when the birds visit these lakes. – Udaya Tejasvi Urs, birdwacher from Yelahanka

FIR

.

Anwas attacked by strangers when he went to a lake near Hosakote to take photos of birds that flock thereIf someone told youwould be injurious to health, you would laugh. But, an amateur photographer, can attest to that.On December 28, Ferdinand, an amateur photographer who works at Amazon, went to thenear Hosakote to take photographs of birds that flock to the lake. But instead of coming back from his expedition with afull of photos of birds, Ferdinand, found himself coming to at a hospital.Around 11 am when Ferdinand was clicking photos of birds at the lake bund, he was attacked from behind with a wooden log.“Two unknown people attacked me with a wooden log. They beat me on my head and on my left hand and I fell unconscious on the lake bund. Later, some people found me unconscious and shifted me to a government hospital at Hosakote for treatment. At 6.30 pm, I was shifted to Columbia Asia Hospital infor treatment,’’Immanval Ferdinand said in a statement to Hostakote police.The police have registered a First Information Report () against the two unknown people under Section 324 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for assaulting Ferdinand with dangerous weapons.“Our policemen patrol the lake during the evening and at night. This unfortunate incident took place during the day. We will send a policeman to the lake bund in the mornings too. We have registered a case and investigations are on,’’ said Hosakote Police Inspector V D Shivaraju.Meanwhile, lake volunteers and birdwatchers have expressed shock over the incident. They have demanded that the police take strict action against the culprits and beef up security around the lake.“It is quite shocking to know about this incident. My nephew Immanval Ferdinand, a resident of Whitefield, visited Dodda Amani Lake near Hosakote to watch birds and take photos. The miscreants attacked him to snatch the camera, lenses and wallet. I want the Hosakote police to act tough with the miscreants,’’ said Lourd Nathan.Stating that the attack on Immanval Ferdinand was the first of its kind on birdwatchers, Udaya Tejasvi Urs, a photographer from Yelahanka, has advised amateur photographers, especially those working in IT companies, not to visit the lake alone but to go in groups.“I usually visit Hesaraghatta Lake and Magadi Lake for birdwatching. I never go alone. I prefer visiting the lakes with my friends between October and February when the birds visit these lakes,’’ said Udaya Tejasvi Urs.Expressing similar opinion, Manju Vikas Sastry, Secretary of Youth Photographic Society has said the birdwatchers have to be cautious while visiting secluded places.“Miscreants target birdwatchers to snatch costly cameras and lenses which they carry along on these expeditions. I would like to advise them to take photos of unknown persons on their mobile phone if they come across such people. It will help the police to nab the culprits in the event of any unfortunate incident,’’ said Manju Vikas Sastry.The volunteers working at Dodda Amani Lake have described the attack on Immanval Ferdinand as unfortunate and shocking.“We want to create awareness among the visitors on the measures to be taken while visiting Dodda Amani Lake. We have submitted a number of letters to Hosakote Municipal authorities to clear weeds on the lake bund but nothing has been done so far,’’ said Swaroop Bharadwaj, a mechanical engineer who also works as a lakevolunteer.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-618873,msid-73062721/73062721.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/miscreants-can-strike-anywhere-anytime-in-bengaluru/articleshow/73065037.cms
