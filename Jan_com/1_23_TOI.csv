4,['23/01/2020'],Most Desirable Woman on TV 2019: Anushree,"She’s sassy, spunky and has her way with words. So, it’s no wonder, really, that Anushree has literally unparalleled fanfare that propelled her to become the first Kannada TV celebrity with over one million followers on Instagram. This popularity, it seems, has worked for her, as she wins the Bangalore Times Most Desirable Woman on TV 2019 title, hands down. Excerpts from a chat...This is a magical moment for me. It was like expecting the unexpected. The work I do has evoked mixed emotions among people with some liking me and others disliking me. But when I got to know that I am the most desirable woman on television, everything seemed magical. Now, I want to enjoy the next 365 days until the next list is out. Thank you Bangalore Times followers and my fans for helping me get this tag.It was, no doubt, a challenging journey. It wasn’t easy. I’m sure any person’s career journey is often far from easy. But that journey becomes interesting only when you have those challenges. If your path is a smooth-sailing road, then it would be boring. My journey has had a lot of roadblocks and speed-breakers along the way. But I’ve persevered and come through victorious.I would really thank Akul Balaji for this change. I’ve been hosting shows for a decade, but people really started taking note of me only about five years ago, when I was the host of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. I have probably done hundreds of shows before that, but it was Sa Re Ga Ma Pa that made ‘anchor Anushree’. Akul has to be credited for anchors being taken seriously and considered stars too. He got people to notice how shows without anchors are like buses without drivers. Now, shows are being created keeping anchors in mind too, unlike earlier, when they were an afterthought. Also, if you notice, show hosts are now allowed to be themselves and showcase their personality while anchoring, which is in stark contrast to earlier when it was mandatory to be all formal and speak bookish, chaste Kannada.I do give a lot of thought to my look. Personally, I think I am badly dressed when I am not at work. You will not see me in coordinated outfits. In fact, I hate dressing up. But I know that I have to put in an effort and be presentable when I am on television or hosting live shows. The head of the channel that I am associated with thinks that I am a favourite with family audiences, who consider me like one of their own — a daughter, perhaps. So, he keeps telling me that I have to maintain that family-friendly look. This means that I cannot wear torn jeans for TV, as families are watching me. I really want to meet those families (laughs). Despite my modest outfits, I often get compliments. So, when deciding my look, I give extra thought to the colours and ensure that my outfits allow me to move around freely, as I hate being stationary in one place.That’s a tricky question. Everyone desires something and that keeps changing. As for me, I think people might have chosen me not only for my anchoring, but for the person that I am. Many people walk up to me and tell me how inspirational I have been to them. They applaud my career-driven attitude, which makes me want to desire more.I really like Priyanka Chopra Jonas . Even without a background in showbiz, she went on to become Miss World and then went on to do well in Bollywood and carve a niche for herself in Hollywood too. She’s so multi-talented. If I had to emulate someone, it would definitely be Priyanka.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73520452,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-150704/73520452.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/kannada/most-desirable-woman-on-tv-2019-anushree/articleshow/73520464.cms

While he is gearing up for his Malayalam debut with Priyadarshan’s Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham , the actor will also be making his Telugu debut in Ani Sasi’s (son of late IV Sasi) next, which will also star Nithya Menen and Ritu Varma in the lead.What’s interesting is that he has to put on an additional 20kg for his role in the film. “Yes, I play a chef who weighs 100kg in the film. There is a connection to my weight and the storyline and I have put on 20kg for the role. Though there will be some prosthetics, I am still in the process of gaining weight for the role,” says Ashok, adding, “It feels very different; I am having fun putting on weight for a role.”The film, a romantic comedy, is set in London. “At present, we are in London shooting for the movie. Ani and I did a short film titled Maya, which got international recognition. He is also the writer of Marakkar. We were discussing this film for some time now and we are happy that the shooting is on. I am really kicked about my Telugu debut and I am learning the language,” says Ashok. Nasser and Sathya are part of the film, too, and the team has one more schedule, which will be shot in India.Ashok also has Senorita in Tamil, which will be directed by newcomer Swathini. Busy with movies in different languages, Ashok says, “I am in the romcom frame of mind.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73520060,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-995704/73520060.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/ashok-selvan-is-a-100-kg-chef-in-his-telugu-debut/articleshow/73520060.cms
6,['23/01/2020'],"Acting was easy, but the challenge was in dubbing: Sreeram","He grapples, loosens the weapon from his opponent’s hand, overturns him and pins him down on the floor and with that 59-year-old Sreeram winds up an hour-and-a-half session of Krav Maga training.Better known as Krav Maga Sreeram , it is his skills in this martial art that landed him his debut film, Sillu Karupatti. Wiping sweat off his face, he pulls a chair and settles down for a chat with us on his journey from a sales executive to a Krav Maga instructor and now, an actor. “Art has always been part of my life. But I didn’t have anything to do with movies until Sillu Karupatti even though my father aspired to join films and came to Chennai in 1969,” he starts.Sreeram says, “I am originally from Nannilam in Nagapattinam. My father, who was better known as Sama in the literary circles, and K Balachander (KB) were classmates in school. They used to be active in thinnai drama. Later, KB came to Chennai and he worked for the AG’s office. My father joined the Life Insurance Corporation and was posted in Madurai. But they continued to be in touch. Those days, drama was a big thing and KB’s niche was social and urban family dramas. My father would come for story discussions and it continued even for films. By 70s, KB completely moved to the big screen. Even though my father came to Chennai in 1969 on KB’s insistence, he couldn’t pursue movies because of his ill-health. My father even asked me if I wanted him to introduce me to KB and work under him as an assistant director. But I didn’t show much interest then.”Sreeram says that it was after he happened to read something that his father had written in his diary, that his life changed. “I didn’t pursue art even though I realised my artistic skills at a very young age. I was a part of NCC and pursued boxing and karate for a while. I dreamt of joining the armed forces. But I ended up in sales. My father had a habit of writing diaries. As I was going through one of them during a usual drinking session in a hotel room after work, my eyes fell on a notation across one of the pages, ‘Oru kai thukivecha yogimathiri en vazhkai ayidichu’, which meant that if you don’t use your skills for a long time it will wean away. Though I was drunk, it pricked my conscience. He gave me education and economic stability. And more than anything else, I imbibed artistic skills from him. The next day morning, I wrote my resignation letter.”So, in 1989, Sreeram says, he decided to dabble in art. “Though the salary was less as compared to my previous job, I joined a small ad agency. My wife was supportive. She said, ‘Pursue whatever you want as long as we don’t have debts’. Initially, I’d draw logos with hand and reproduce them at some DTP centre. Slowly, I got used to computers. I chose advertising to start with as it helped me merge my sales knowledge and artistic skills. It was a good move; there was no looking back.”How did Krav Maga happen? “I was around 45 — I felt I had to be a bit more serious about my health. But I was sure I wouldn’t enjoy working out in a gym. And that’s when I stumbled upon Krav Maga. It appeared more fluid and pragmatic when compared to traditional martial arts. At that time, there were these Israeli instructors of the art who had come to Delhi for a workshop — I attended two of their week-long courses. That introduced me to the fundamentals of Krav Maga. I completed three levels, and in a few years, started teaching on weekends and later, it became full-time affair.”Later, he recalls, he got introduced to the present DGP of Chennai, JK Tripathy, and was asked to help with a presentation on Public Administration for an international conference. “And that’s how I started off as a consultant for presentations of the police. Now, I am a police instructor for Krav Maga,” says Sreeram.“In the last few years,” Sreeram continues, “I have only been looking at doing Krav Maga sessions twice a day and some painting in between. But things have changed since Sillu Karupatti happened,” he admits.So, how did he land this role? “One of my students, an aspiring actor, posted pics of some of our sessions on social media. This was in 2016. Then, Halitha, the director of Sillu Karupatti, was looking for an old man to play the male lead in one of the stories in the anthology. She called me and asked if I’d be willing for the role. I thought it would be like any other offer I had been offered earlier by filmmakers, but never materialised. But when I read the script, I realised that it was about 20 pages of romance (laughs). And finally, we shot for five days.”How was it being in front of the camera for the first time? “I didn’t have major problems in acting. I have been a good communicator and have been on stage on many occasions. I would ask the director the mood that particular shot needed and then, go for the take. The challenge was in dubbing. After almost a year, I was called for dubbing. So, I had to go back in time and get into that same mood. That was a real challenge. I am not a voice artiste. But the director didn’t want to use a dubbing artiste. Since it was a love story about two older people, she didn’t want the audience to have any pre-conceived image about the protagonists.”But ever since the film released, he has been getting friend requests from Ceylon, Maldives, Singapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong, he laughs. But what about friends and family? “My wife hasn’t seen the film yet because it’s all about romance. There’s a scene where I kiss the woman’s shadow. When someone says that particular scene was good, my wife is like, ‘Kiss panreya, nee?’ (laughs). It’s just that she can’t leave the grandchildren and go watch it. She’ll probably watch it when it comes on online platforms,” he signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73520099,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1189523/73520099.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/acting-was-easy-but-the-challenge-was-in-dubbing-sreeram/articleshow/73520099.cms
7,['23/01/2020'],I stayed true to myself during my stay in Bigg Boss house: Chandan Achar,"Even though he was nominated for eviction almost every week during his stay in the Bigg Boss Kannada house, actor Chandan Achar not only persisted, but managed to hang on for over 90 days, which is a phenomenal feat. “I don’t fret over things that are not under my control. I was confident of winning the show, even though I was getting nominated every week. I thank people for having voted for me every time I was in the danger zone through these weeks. In my entire journey, I have stayed true to myself, which is the only reason I was able to survive in the house for more than 90 days,” he says.In staying true to his self, Chandan gave the housemates and audiences a glimpse of his short temper as well, when he got into a spat with Raju Thalikote and Kuri Prathap . “I played the game fairly without any biases. I am the one who calls a spade a spade, which did not go down well with many members in the house. This is also why I was getting nominated so frequently. But having said that, my spat with Raju and Kuri was because of the situation. It was an emotional outburst. Most of contestants think I am short-tempered, but I don’t hold anything against any contestant in the house. Sometimes, the tasks make us behave a certain way, which may seem unacceptable,” he says.The actor also managed to rub the ladies in the house the wrong way with some of his comments about their makeup regimes. “I said what I felt. The task required us to recall our experience from the first day in the house. On the morning after the first day, I couldn’t recognise most of the female inmates, as none of them had makeup on. I feel, as an artist, makeup has its own value, there is no need to cover our faces with makeup throughout the day. I made the comment on a lighter note, it wasn’t meant to hurt anyone,” he adds.So, does he have any takeaways from the show? “It became really difficult to live with eight to 10 contestants in the house owing to differences in opinion. I have now learnt to respect the opinion of other people, but only if they are genuine. Even If I don’t respect opinions, I think there is no need to have hatred towards them,” says Chandan, who eventually ended up being more of a loner during his stint on the show.Interestingly, enough, the actor says that he has favourite moments from the show. “I already miss Bigg Boss’ voice. The tasks taught me not to lose my temper in tough situations. Despite all differences, when festivals came, we celebrated together, which is what makes Bigg Boss a special journey in my life. I cherish the time I spent with Jai Jagdish, as there was so much to learn from his wealth of experience. Vasuki Vaibhav is from theatre background, so we connected well and Sujatha was a treasure trove of knowledge.”On nominating Priyanka while being evicted from the show, Chandan adds that he believes she is losing herself to win the show. “She has to play the game in right spirit. There should be no room for any contestants to fake emotions in the house,” he says, adding that he considers Shine Shetty a strong contender to win the show. “Shine is a more balanced person in the house. He knows what needs to be done win the show.

Touted to be one of the highest paid actresses on television today, ask her if the news is true and she says, “I was 13 when I started with Sapne Suhane... and now I am 20. And if there are articles about me being one of the highest paid actresses, I will not quote the amount, but I have actually worked really hard to reach where I am today. I have put in blood and sweat in everything that I have done. I started auditioning when I was just 9 years old. I gave hundreds of auditions and when things did not work out in my favour, I thought probably I am not made for acting. I have seen bad times. And even though I am earning a decent amount today, it has not got into my head. The profession in which I am has no stability. Take for example my last two shows Rishton Ka Chakravyuh and Mariam Khan – Reporting Live, which shut down after a few months only. If I am earning good for six months, I am not sure if I will be earning also in the next six months or not, and yes, as of now I am not the highest paid actress on television but I would love to be one,” says Mahima.Mahima Makwana (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)She adds, “I started off very young but that was out of choice and not out of any family pressure. I wanted to get into acting and start earning as well. Now I am taking care of my bank account as I have grown up. Even my mom is helping me manage my finances and we both are the raja-rani of our lives.”She says, “I feel proud to have bought a house of my own in a city like Mumbai when I was just 15 though it was just one BHK. I now wish to buy a bigger flat of my own as my brother has recently got married. I just want to get settled in life and stay independent all my life.”Not happy with the present scenario of shows going off air, Mahima shares, “It is very recently while giving an interview when asked if I miss my Sapne Suhane... days, I realised that more than missing the serial part, I miss the attention that the actors used to get then. There is so much of competition between TV shows and content on web that actors today do not get that much of attention. Also, there is no longevity of shows today which was there earlier. Sapne Suhane went on for three years when we were aiming for five years. But now as an actress I aim for a show to run for a year.

While Vishal Vashishtha and Rrahul Sudhir have been finalised to play the two heroes, Helly Shah has been roped in to play the protagonist in the new show. Ask her if she feels any pressure to make this instalment more popular than the previous one and she replies, “Not at all. In fact, I am quite excited, as I always wanted to do a thriller show, and I am getting to do one with this. I will try my best to do justice to my character.”Unlike last time, the heroine won’t be seen in a double role in the new show. This works well for Helly, who was in the news for her health woes during her stint in 'Sufiyana Pyaar Mera', in which she played a double role. The actress had then mentioned that playing twin roles is quite challenging. She says, “I don’t mind playing a double role again, but there is no such track in 'Ishq Mein Marjawaan' as of now. I got three months to focus on my health, which I couldn’t during the shoot of my previous show.

In his first Bollywood outing, Happy Phir Bhag Jayegi (2018), he was one of the four guys leading the cast with Sonakshi Sinha as the central character.When asked if he feared being overshadowed by his female co-stars during Panga, Jassie said, “I don’t compete with my co-stars, I just do my work and try to give it my best. I was cast in Panga even before my first Hindi film released. So, for me, even Panga is like my debut. As an actor, it doesn’t matter who is in the frame with me; I just focus on what I have to do in a scene. Like with Kangana, we used to sit down and read our scenes together before we started the shoot. Ashwiny ma’am would also explain everything to us. So, there was no need for me to feel outnumbered or overshadowed.”In his previous interview to BT, Jassie had said that he had turned down films that didn’t promise to put him on the poster. After working in two films, does he think differently now? He replied, “I’ve worked as a lead actor in Punjabi films and didn’t want to do two-scene roles in Bollywood.

""It is a dream for any NCC cadet to march at Rajpath and there are only a few lucky ones who get to experience that. For that, even if we need to lose out on our sleep for six months, I think it is definitely worth it,"" says Pankaj Goswami, an NCC cadet from Rajasthan Directorate, who is part of the Rajpath contingent. Marching at Rajpath is not 'just a drill' for these cadets who have spent the last six months preparing for the event.For some, taking part in the parade is fulfiling their parents' dream and for others, the Rajpath march has been their goal since the day they joined the NCC. ""Not everyone gets the chance to be where we are.

Ahead of their big day, the cadets tell us about the hard work that they have put in in the past one year to be Rajpath cadets and why this year's parade is important for them.Even when the Rajpath cadets return to the camp from practice, they keep working on improving their drill.

We have competed with lakhs of cadets to be Rajpath cadets and as an NCC cadet, it has been my biggest dream to come here. Not everyone gets the chance to salute the President and the country will be watching us, so it is a great feeling. Marching at Rajpath is an achievement in itself.""Nidhi, an NCC cadet from Punjab and Haryana Directorate, while taking a break from her march-past, tells us, ""I have been preparing for the Republic Day Camp (RDC) since June. First, I attended the base camp in Rohtak, then took part in Inter-Group Competition, then pre-RDC camp and then after selection, I came here. As a Rajpath cadet, you should be mentally prepared to deal with anything that comes your way. This Republic Day is important for me because we will be marching at Rajpath and it is a dream come true.""Aarti Tanwar, a Rajpath cadet from Punjab and Haryana Directorate, has been preparing for two years to be a Rajpath cadet. ""This is my second year with NCC and I have been preparing for two years for this. I have attended more than six camps before finally attending the RDC and I am the Navy Commander of our contingent. As a cadet for Rajpath, one is expected to give their best, so one needs to come prepared. After all the hard work that we have put in at various camps, we will now finally be marching at RDC and we will get to meet the ministers and officers,,"" she says.Following NCC's motto of unity and discipline, one can see cadets following instructions and working on a strict schedule everyday as part of their training at the camp. Arukshita Tyagi from Delhi Directorate shares, ""You don't just learn about following schedules but you also get to understand the meaning of giving respect to your seniors, juniors and fellow cadets. Since I am from the Delhi Directorate, our practice started in July. I took part in four camps after being a part of a selection process. In Rajpath, one requires consistent performance in all camps and you get maximum marks for your turnout, which includes your uniform, scarf, ceremonials and how you present yourself. For our braids, we need to make a figure of eight and no hair or thread on our head or uniform should be loose.""Despite all the challenges, the cadets are not complaining. ""I have been part of seven camps before this and last year, I did not get the chance to be a part of RDC. And therefore this year, I worked really hard to be part of the camp.

16,['23/01/2020'],"Remo D’Souza: When I make a dance film, I ensure that the characters have a reason to dance","Choreographer-turned-filmmaker Remo D’Souza gave the dance film genre a boost by introducing the Indian audience to the world of new-age dance through his movies. While his first two films, 'ABCD: Anybody Can Dance' (2013) and 'ABCD 2' (2015), were all about the art form on stage, this time around, he is taking it to the streets. He promises that this experiment of his called ' Street Dancer 3D ' is going to be a joyride. In a chat with BT, he talks about casting stars in his film, box-office expectations and making one of India’s best dancers — Prabhudeva — dance to his tunes. Excerpts:I feel that I have not explored even five per cent of the kind of dance and music that’s there in our country and across the world. While the earlier two films were based on dancing on stage, we have taken to the streets with this one. 'Street Dancer 3D' is based in London and revolves around Indian, Pakistani and people of other nationalities. It’s about desis, who are born and brought up there and the film focuses on what they feel about India. It is based on a documentary on illegal immigrants. There’s a strong storyline that sees a fusion with dance and music. When I make a dance film, I make sure that the characters have a reason to dance. It took some time to find that reason. But when we found it, it was amazing.A lot of people associate Bollywood with just song and dance. I get annoyed when they say that. Aise hi thodi hum duniya mein sabse zyada films banaate hain. Toh kabhi kabhi bura lagta hai, but I am glad that the perception is changing. Maybe, in the coming years, we will prove that the Indian film industry is the best. Bollywood is known for its music and dance, and there are no two ways about it. However, we are now making films without music and dance, too. But back when I decided to make a film on dance, there weren’t too many films of that genre. Everyone told me that this genre doesn’t work and that’s why no one makes any films that focus on dance. During the process, I realised that if I focus only on music and dance, without any story, it won't work. I knew that I needed a strong story to pull it off. A strong storyline is of paramount importance to support a dance film, and when you have that, you’ve got a winner.The film industry doesn’t talk about hits and flops anymore. Now, it’s all about the box-office collection on the day of the release, the second day and weekends. Today, no one asks, ‘Picture kaisi hai?’ All they ask is the first-day collection of the film. As a filmmaker, it’s scary to answer questions about the collections instead of how a movie is made. A film is judged on that. While it is scary, this is how the industry works now, and so, numbers matter. When we started working on 'ABCD 2', I realised that the person playing the central character had to be a strong actor along with being a good dancer. That combination was tough to find. Our quest to find that perfect combination ended with Varun and Shraddha. When we met Shraddha for 'ABCD 2', she said that she would audition for the part even if she was not chosen for it. She did this despite being a big name in the industry. I appreciate her dedication and sincerity, and we cast her.The script was originally written keeping in mind that this would be the third instalment of 'ABCD'. But since the studio that backed the first two films had shut down its Hindi film production unit, I had to take the film to someone else. I couldn’t use the same title, and so, we named the film 'Street Dancer 3D'. Varun was the original choice for it along with Katrina. However, just a month before we were set to go on floors, she had to opt out of this film due to Bharat. Everyone knows what happened with that film… Priyanka Chopra (Jonas) backed out and Katrina had to step in. We were stuck because I couldn’t push my schedule, as I wanted to shoot during winter in London. Being a thorough professional, Katrina herself told us that we should go with somebody else. That’s when Shraddha came on board. I had to make very minute changes in the script when she joined the team. Having said that, it doesn’t mean that one is indispensable. It could have happened with the actor, too. If an actress can get replaced, so can the actor.Not at all. He is the sweetest person I have met in my life. Despite being a big director and actor, he behaves like a newcomer on the set and surrenders himself to the vision of the director. He has never read the scripts of the films I have offered him, nor has he ever inquired about his character. He just comes and asks, ‘What do you want me to do?’ That’s how much he trusts me. His favourite line is, ‘Don’t make me dance so much; you should consider my age. These youngsters are better dancers than me.’ But as soon as the music is turned on and he starts dancing, he puts everyone to shame. He is like family to me, and will be a part of every dance film that I make.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73522086,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-60627/73522086.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/remo-dsouza-when-i-make-a-dance-film-i-ensure-that-the-characters-have-a-reason-to-dance/articleshow/73521967.cms

20,['23/01/2020'],India to ignore what Trump said on Kashmir to Imran,"This story is from January 23, 2020

President Donald Trump meets with Pakistani PM Imran Khan at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland. ... Read More

NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD: India is not likely to react strongly to US President Donald Trump ’s remarks on Kashmir to Pakistani PM Imran Khan during their conversation in Davos even as Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said Trump had assured Khan that he would visit Islamabad soon.

Apart from the view in government there isn’t really anything significant that the US president has committed to, New Delhi would not like to sour the atmosphere before Trump’s visit here next month. Trump is scheduled to visit India for the first time on February 24.

Senior government sources said, “Our position on the Kashmir issue has been clear and consistent. There is no role for any third party in this matter. There is nothing further to add.” They also pointed out that Trump did not himself mention either “mediation” or “facilitation” in his remarks.

Asked if he would visit Pakistan while heading out to India, Trump said, ""We are visiting right now, so we won't really have to. But I wanted to say hello for both a relationship standpoint...we have had a great relationship.” He added that US-Pakistan relations were at their closest at present.

Qureshi, however, claimed Trump had assured Khan that he would visit Pakistan soon but did not specify when the visit would take place. Ahead of US elections, it is difficult to see Trump embarking on a politically fraught visit.

On Kashmir, sources said Trump’s position had not changed, and he had stuck to saying US is “following it very, very closely” without committing to any particular direction. ""We are talking about Kashmir and with relation to what's going on with Pakistan and India. If we can help, we certainly will be helping. We have been watching it and following it very, very closely,"" Trump said.

The president’s visit to India will be used to sign off on a trade deal that has been remarkably difficult to close. This week, commerce minister Piyush Goyal is expected to hold another round of talks with his counterpart Robert Lighthizer in Davos.

US ambassador Ken Juster recently led a group of foreign envoys to J&K on a visit that was intended to show that while the internal conditions may not be optimal, there was enough to be optimistic about. Balancing out the positive feedback was a cautionary tweet by the US state department urging the Indian government to release local politicians who had been detained and to restore internet communications in the Valley.

Khan, however, kept India upfront. In his remarks, he said, ""There are issues that we want to talk about, like Afghanistan. Fortunately, we are on the same page... India, of course, it is a big issue. We always hope that the US will play its part in resolving that because no other country can.""

Over the weekend, Qureshi had met his US counterpart Mike Pompeo in Washington to request US assistance to get Pakistan off the FATF grey list, citing the financial burdens. Pakistan has to complete compliance on at least 21 out of 27 action plans it has agreed to before the FATF eases pressure.

Union defence minister Rajnath Singh speaks during a pro-CAA rally in Meerut. (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: The youth of Jammu and Kashmir are “nationalists” and those misleading them are the actual culprits, said defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday, while also stressing that India could never become a theocratic state like Pakistan because it considers all religions equal.

The remarks come after chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat last week expressed concern at the way boys and girls, some as young as 10-12 years’ old, were being radicalised in Kashmir. But the defence minister, speaking at the NCC Republic Day Camp here, said the children of J&K are nationalists and should not be seen in any other way.

""Youngsters are youngsters only. Sometimes, the way they should be motivated, people do not motivate them. In fact, they are motivated in the wrong direction. That is why children should not be blamed for this. The ones who are motivating them in the wrong direction are the culprits,"" said Singh, replying to a question on children in J&K being motivated to join the NCC.

The minister also underlined that India is proud to be a secular country. “We (India) said we would not discriminate among religions. Why did we do that? Our neighbouring country has declared that their state has a religion. They have declared themselves a theocratic state. We didn't declare so,” he said.

“Even America is a theocratic country. India is not a theocratic country. Why? Because our saints and seers did not just consider the people living within our borders as part of the family, but called everyone living in the world as one family. They gave the slogan of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’,” the minister added.

“Our Indian values say that all religions are equal. That is why India never declared itself as theocratic state. We never said that our religion would be Hindu, Sikh or Buddhist. We never said any such thing. We are a secular state. All religions can live here,” he said.

Gen Rawat, speaking at the Raisina Dialogue last week, had said, “Girls and boys as young as 10 and 12 in Kashmir are now being radicalised. These people can still be isolated from radicalisation in a gradual way.”

“But there are people who have completely been radicalised. These people need to be taken out separately, possibly taken into to some deradicalisation camps. We have deradicalisation camps running in our country. Let me tell you, Pakistan is doing the same,” he had said.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to stay the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, declining to take note of protests and anti-CAA resolutions by the Kerala and Punjab assemblies , and brushed aside repeated pleas for deferment of processes relating to the National Population Register (NPR) as a corollary of CAA .The court said the petitions would be heard by a five-judge Constitution bench and granted the Centre four weeks to file a comprehensive response. This means the hearing will not start before February 22.A bench of CJI S A Bobde and Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna had a tough time dealing with a record 144 petitions represented by nearly 300 advocates leading to a packed courtroom and a cacophonous atmosphere. It took CJI Bobde close to 15 minutes to bring order for a string of renowned advocates — Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi, Rajeev Dhavan, Vikas Singh, K V Vishwanathan, Shyam Divan, Indira Jaising , Jayant Bhushan, Prashant Bhushan, Colin Gonsalves and Sajan Poovaayya — to argue against CAA and NPR.Importantly, the bench agreed with submissions that petitions from Assam and Tripura should be heard separately from the larger clutch as they were opposing CAA on a ground very different from other parts of the country. They said the people of Assam were agitated as the CAA abruptly changed the cut-off date for grant of citizenship to illegal migrants from Bangladesh from March 24, 1971 (as fixed in the 1985 Assam Accord) to December 31, 2014 in the CAA. The court said these petitions would be heard after two weeks.The bench’s pronouncement, “we are not going to grant any ex parte stay”, saw Sibal arguing that the process for implementation of NPR would start in April and it would be in the interest of justice if the court asked the government to defer it for two months. However, attorney general K K Venugopal and solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “That kind of interim order will be as good as a stay order.”Sibal attempted several indirect pleas to get at least the NPR process deferred, but the CJI-led bench said, “If the law is prevented from being implemented or ordered to be deferred, it is as good as granting a stay. We are not going to do any such thing without hearing arguments on the requirement of stay. Arguments for interim order will also be heard by the Constitution bench.” When Sibal persisted, the CJI said, “The (CAA) law will always remain subject to the outcome of the petitions.”Explaining why it was not considering arguments on interim stay at this stage, the CJI said, “The problem is that petitions are continuously being filed. If the court passes an interim order on one batch of petitions, then a fresh batch will file petitions seeking review of it on the ground that they were not heard. And it will go on and on in a vicious cycle.”Sibal said the importance of the issue raised by the petitions and its consequences for the nation warranted hearing by a five judge Constitution bench. The bench agreed and said, “Why not? Maybe all the petitions should be referred to a five-judge bench.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73532570,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-106126,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-refuses-to-stay-caa-and-npr-or-process-for-their-implementation/articleshow/73532593.cms
23,['23/01/2020'],Govt to Supreme Court: Put 7-day limit for pleas against execution,"NEW DELHI: Responding to public resentment at condemned prisoners in the Nirbhaya case exploiting Supreme Court-mandated guidelines to delay their hanging, the home ministry on Wednesday moved the apex court seeking a modification of execution guidelines which have been seen by many as privileging rights of death row convicts over the interests of victims and society’s cry for justice.The ministry requested the SC to fix a time limit of seven days for a death row convict within which he must file a mercy petition after warrant for his execution is issued by the competent court. “Mandate all courts, state government and prison authorities to issue death warrant of a condemned convict within seven days of rejection of mercy petition and to execute him within seven days thereafter irrespective of the pendency of review/curative petitions by co-accused,” it said.Pointing to how guidelines were misused, the Centre said condemned convicts, if there were more than one (as in the Nirbhaya case), adopted a strategy to file curative petition in the SC one after the other to delay execution of the death sentence awarded to them concurrently by the trial court, the high court and the SC. It requested the court to fix a time period in which the convict could file a curative petition after rejection of review petition by the SCThe ministry said the guidelines laid down by the SC in January 2014 for filing mercy petitions and execution of death sentence took into account the interests of those on death row and this had to be balanced by another set of of prescriptions which took into account the interests of the victim, their families and the larger public interest.“While taking care of the rights of convicts, it is more important and need of the hour to lay down guidelines in the interest of the victims, their families and the larger public interest, lest the convicts found to be guilty of such horrible, dreadful, cruel, abominable, ghastly, gruesome and heinous offences would be permitted to play with the majesty of law and indefinitely delay or prolong the execution of the death sentence awarded to them,” the ministry said.“The country is facing menace of terrorism, rape, murder and rape-cum-murder offences where death sentence can be awarded. There are many instances of heinous and horrific offences of rape accompanied by an equally horrible and horrific offence of murder of the victim which shakes the collective conscience of the nation. The accused gets a fair trial through the three-tier justice system. Even after the SC confirms the death sentence, the convict has recourse to review petition which is heard in open court,” it added.“It often happens that one accused files review petition/mercy petition which gets rejected and other co-convicts choose not to file such petitions or initiate other proceedings. When the review/curative gets rejected of one accused, another files similar petition to attempt to delay the process of execution of condemned prisoners. This is for the reason that though many jail manuals do not prohibit execution of death sentence of co-convicts one by one, there may be some states where the execution of death sentence with regard to all the convicts in a case may be mandated to be done simultaneously,” the ministry said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73532909,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-37645,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-to-sc-put-7-day-limit-for-pleas-against-execution/articleshow/73532903.cms

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has reinstated a woman employee, who, after being dismissed for insubordination, had levelled unprecedented sexual harassment charges against previous CJI Ranjan Gogoi . A three-judge SC inquiry panel had concluded that the charges were “without substance”.

After facing an inquiry by the three-judge panel headed by Justice S A Bobde (currently CJI) that gave him a clean chit in May last year, Justice Gogoi bore no rancour when the woman complainant moved a plea before him in October last year seeking reinstatement.

The junior court assistant, who had accused the then CJI of an incident on October 11, 2018, was immediately ordered to leave the CJI’s residence office and report to the SC registry for work. However, she resisted the directions till October 27.

Later, she joined the SC registry but then faced disciplinary proceedings for insubordination leading to her dismissal in December 2018. She had levelled charges in an affidavit on April 19, 2019.

The complainant withdrew from the in-house inquiry midway. The allegations and subsequent developments had enveloped the SC in a controversy with a section of activist-lawyers pitching in for the dismissed staffer.

Five months later, the woman moved a petition before Justice Gogoi seeking mercy reinstatement on the ground that loss of job had put her family in extreme financial difficulty. She said she was not being able to get a job and requested the then CJI to reinstate her with back wages.

Justice Gogoi asked Justice Bobde to decide on her application, and the latter ordered reinstatement in the first week of November with back wages keeping in mind her advanced pregnancy. She joined service in November, received back wages and proceeded on maternity leave.

When news broke about the unprecedented charges, then CJI Gogoi held court on a Saturday on April 20 and hinted that there were bigger forces behind the allegations. He had said, “Nobody can catch me on money part, so they found this. I don't think a junior court assistant is behind this. There has to be a bigger force behind this. They want to destabilise the CJI, considering the important cases coming up for hearing next week in an election month.

“The independence of the judiciary is under severe threat. If judges are to be vilified like this, why would any good person want to become a judge? Who will want to become a judge and retire with a bank balance of Rs 6.8 lakh? I want to tell the country that the judiciary is under threat.”

HYDERABAD: Claiming to have unearthed a major land scam in Amaravati , the Andhra Pradesh police has revealed that some of the poorest people in the state have been shown as owners of lands running into crores.According to an investigation by CID , 797 white ration card-holders, each with a monthly income of less than Rs 5,000, bought lands worth Rs 220 crore in Amaravati in 2014 and 2015.The state CID has now written to the Income Tax department and Enforcement Directorate asking for an investigation into possible tax evasion and money laundering in the deals. The letter, a copy of which is with TOI, states that the investigation found that many of the land buyers did not even have PAN cards and paid no income tax.After Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the then TDP government had announced that Amaravati would be the new capital of bifurcated AP and pooled 33,000 acres of land in the region next to Vijayawada. The YSRCP government that came to power in 2019, however, decided to have three separate capitals with Amaravati having only the assembly and all government offices would shift to Visakhapatnam.After detecting that white ration card holders were being shown as landowners, CID registered a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy. In the letter to the to the Andhra Pradesh income tax chief commissioner sent on Wednesday, CID officials stated, “…the investigating officer examined the registrations of suspicious land done during 2014 and 2015 in Amaravati capital area of AP. It came to the light that huge cash transactions took place in purchasing the lands.”The cops have given the I-T officials details of the purchasers, their address, size of land sold, sale deed and market value of the land. ED officials, on the other hand, have been asked to look into possible money laundering in the land deals.Almost all the 797 white ration card holders, who bought 761 acres in the Amaravati capital region, are residents of Guntur, the investigation has shown. Of these, 529 don't have PAN cards. The CID investigation found that the highest number of suspicious transactions took place in Thulluru Mandal where the core capital city of Amaravati was planned and the temporary secretariat and high court buildings have come up.CID has already registered a case against former Minister of Telugudesam party Pattipati Pulla Rao and P Narayana regarding the purchase of assigned land.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73533729,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-147304,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/land-scam-aps-poorest-own-amaravati-lands-worth-rs-220cr/articleshow/73533641.cms

28,['23/01/2020'],India slips 10 slots to 51st in democracy index,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Protestors under the banner, 'Young India,' participate in a demonstration against Citizenship (Amendment) Act... Read More

NEW DELHI: India has slipped 10 places to 51st position among 167 countries on the Democracy Index , a global ranking of the “most and least” democratic countries prepared by the Economist Intelligence Unit , primarily due to an “erosion of civil liberties in the country”.

The report said India’s score fell from 7.23 (out of 10) in 2018 to 6.90 in 2019, and attributed India’s “democratic regression” to the abrogation of J&K’s special status, suspension of internet in the newly formed UT and protests over the CAA and the National Register of Citizens .

The score of 6.9 is India’s lowest since the inception of the index in 2006. India’s decline coincides with what the report says has been a poor year for democracy globally. India remains well above the 2019 global average of 5.44. India’s highest score was 7.91 in 2014 and since then it has declined.

“The Indian government stripped the Jammu & Kashmir state of its special status by repealing two key constitutional provisions granting it powers of autonomy... Furthermore, Article 35A prevented Indian residents from other states from purchasing land or property in J&K... Ahead of the move, the government deployed a large number of troops in J&K, imposed various other security measures and placed local leaders under house arrest, including those with pro-India credentials. The government also restricted internet access in the state,” the report said.

On the controversial NRC, the index said, “A separate citizenship registration exercise in Assam... has excluded 1.9 million from the final list of NRC. The vast majority of people excluded from NRC are Muslims. The ruling nationalist BJP says that most of the people excluded from the list are immigrants from Bangladesh, whose government denies this... The new citizenship law has enraged the large Muslim population, stoked communal tensions and generated large protests in major cities.”

The report, which has evaluated countries on their civil liberties, political culture, political participation, functioning of government and their electoral processes and pluralism in countries, however, recorded a “steady and significant upward trajectory” in people’s political participation globally, indicating that an increasing number of people are getting involved in the political processes and protesting in comparison to the years before.

KOLKATA: The chill is set to intensify in Kolkata this weekend as the northwesterly wind gains strength. A two-degree drop in minimum temperature is expected in the course of the week.

PATNA: The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel found lost items worth Rs67.6 lakh at the Jayaprakash Narayan International (JPNI) Airport, Patna in 2019. They handed over items worth Rs10.4 lakh to the passengers the same day. Airport manager (APM) returned items worth Rs57.1 lakh to the passengers, who turned up later on.

CISF officials at Patna airport said 12 to 15 passengers either accidentally forget their goods or just dump some to avoid paying charges for extra luggage. “In that case, they just took out few clothes or items that are not costly. Generally, we found the leftover items in the security hold and checking areas,” a CISF official said.

The public relations officer at CISF headquarters, New Delhi, Hemendra Kumar told this newspaper on Wednesday that altogether 2,831 lost items were found by the CISF personnel at Patna airport in 2019, while 1,509 items were recovered in 2018. “The security at city airport monitors the unidentified items on its premises and traces the owners with the help of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed there,” he said.

Patna airport terminal building has over 150 CCTV cameras and 362 CISF personnel for security.

Puja Mehta, a banker in Bengaluru, said she forgot to take her laptop bag from the baggage claim area. “After reaching Patna airport from Bengaluru, I accidentally left my laptop bag. As I was waiting for the cab with my father, who came to pick me up from airport, one CISF personnel came running towards me and returned my bag. I’m very thankful to them for their hard work and vigilance,” she said.

Some flyers thanked CISF on social media. Gyanendra Nath, an IT professional in Victoria Melbourne, tweeted: “Very thankful to BN Sharma, DK Mishra and other CISF and Patna airport staff members for retrieving my hand baggage which got exchanged during my recent travel from Patna to Melbourne via New Delhi. Appreciate your agility and eagerness to help (sic).”

Anshul Agarwal, an engineering student of Pune, wrote on January 15: “I accidentally dropped my ring near the scanner at Patna airport. I informed security personnel about my missing ring. CISF’s official Ujjwal Kumar assured me that even a needle doesn’t get lost at Patna airport. True to his words, he recovered it within 15 minutes (sic).”

The CISF personnel claimed that generally people forget items like laptop, mobile phone and charger, pen drive, sunglasses, bottles, edible items, umbrella, jewellery, wallet and money bag, electronic device, jacket and dress materials among other things. “When no one turns up to claim the items, we put the description on CISF website and if no one turns up to collect their items, these are auctioned by the airport after one year,” the CISF personnel said.

The sources at Patna airport said passengers usually leave inedible items, inexpensive clothes, sunglasses, bags and other things. “In some cases, flyers forget their expensive items like laptop and mobile phone,” they said.

Representative image

PATNA: The state transport department is set to launch 30 electric buses ( e-buses ) on major routes in the state capital by December end.

Patna Smart City Limited has approved the project of running e-buses by the Bihar State Road Transport Corporation on its 13th meeting held with different stakeholders on Tuesday. A sum of around Rs 10 crore has been sanctioned to BSRTC under the Smart City Mission Fund.

The buses will be procured on the basis of a tripartite agreement which will be signed by the Central government, PSCL and the state government. The Central government will provide funds under the FAME II scheme (Fast Adoption and Manufacture of Electric Vehicles). The state government has already launched electric car last year in July while the electric two-wheelers also available in the market.

Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the state government is promoting the use of electric vehicles using green technology by giving 50% reduction in road tax. “We will soon invite bids and begin procurement work for e-buses. Bihar will get the buses by December 2020,” he said.

He added, “All the electric buses would run on major routes in the city including Bailey Road, Ashok Rajpath, Digha, Gandhi Maidan, Rajendra Nagar, Station Road, Airport Road and Phulwarisharif.”

The e-buses are costly and one bus will cost around Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2 crore. The e-buses can cover a distance of 250 km after being charged once (four hours) and these buses do not emit fumes, thus helping reduce air pollution. Recently, a delegation of transport department had visited West Bengal where e-buses are being used by the state government. Another delegation of transport department would soon visit Mumbai.

Agarwal said that the delegation members will learn from the experts in Mumbai and get the details required to run the e-buses in the city. “A plan to run the electric buses will be prepared accordingly. As for the maintenance of e-buses, the company from where we procured the buses will take care of it. According to transport secretary, to charge the e-buses they need high-powered charging point because it needs more power supply than e-car or e-rickshaw. A high-powered charging station would be developed at Transport Complex, which would come up at Phulwarisharif near Patna airport. We are preparing a detailed project report on this. We will also put up charging stations at several locations in city where it is required,” said Agarwal.

Transport department is preparing an electric vehicle policy to promote e-vehicles in state, rebate and plan to set-up charging stations. The department is also in the process of converting 100 city buses that runs on diesel into compressed natural gas (CNG).

Will all Tata Motors vehicles now also have an electric variant? Is that part of the plan?

What other spin offs will you offer from the Omega architecture?

As part of your cost control measures, you have shut down your Thailand subsidiary. Will other overseas subsidiaries also face the axe? What about Tata Daewoo for instance which is facing headwinds in Korea?

Are you capping your investment plans to ride out the slowdown?

CHENNAI: With Altroz and its new BS6 ready passenger vehicle range, Tata Motors is readying itself to ride out the slowdown and the transition to BS6 smoothly. In a chat, Guenter Butschek, CEO & MD, Tata Motors, talks about electric plans, cost cutting and more. Excerpts:Not yet. In principle all future launches will provide an EV option. We already are offering a Tigor EV, a Nexon EV and an Altroz EV. All the new products based on the Alfa architecture will provide an electric variant. As for the Omega architecture, this too is battery electric protected. We had in fact debuted a concept in Geneva 2018 that was based on Omega architecture. So it’s technically feasible but not commercially viable. We would like to promote electric as a mainstream solution. The sweet spot in India to accelerate the adoption of EV is the segment below or just above 4 metres.Harrier has done well and December in fact was the best ever month for the model in retail and wholesale. The Harrier upgrade will be presented in the Auto Expo. Like the others, the BS6 version will be packed with other features including automatic transmission and a sunroof. Harrier is a flagship product and needs its own space. But there is a 7-seater variant on the Omega architecture which is in the making which will be launched in the market soon. There will be more products in 3-5 years to improve market reach. The two new architectures will have 12-14 products, taking our market coverage to 90%. We are looking at a larger share of the upper end of the market coverage.We took a call on our subsidiaries like Thailand. As for Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle, yes the economic environment in Korea is very tough. Medium heavy trucks have declined, competition brisk but Tata Daewoo is in strong recovery mode. It is a strong performing asset which complements Tata Motors truck range in medium and heavy duty segments.The last 9 months has demanded strong focus on cash management. We are focusing on receivables but also on spend. There is serious review going on and we are controlling not cutting our spend. The adjustment is to keep control on our cash because cash is king in difficult situations.",auto,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73542053,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1048416,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/cars/we-would-like-to-promote-electric-as-a-mainstream-solution-tamo/articleshow/73542064.cms
34,['23/01/2020'],Over three fourths of Crisil revenue now come from global biz,"This story is from January 23, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Crisil , India’s first ratings agency, now draws almost 75% of its revenues from its global analytics business. The company is set to demerge the ratings business into a subsidiary in 2020 to comply with regulations.

Crisil, which was originally incorporated as Credit Rating and Information Services of India Limited, was majority acquired by global ratings agency S&P. Since then, the company has gone on a global acquisition spree of non-ratings businesses and a majority of its employees in India are now engaged in analytics and providing support to the operations abroad.

Although the ratings division has always been a separate unit, the regulators felt that there should be a separate board of directors for that business. Sebi had directed credit ratings agencies (CRAs) to segregate the non-ratings business into a separate entity by May 30 this year. However, given that the non-ratings business is the dominant one for Crisil, it has decided to subsidiarise the ratings business.

Speaking to TOI, Crisil MD Ashu Suyash said that the company would be seeking shareholder approval for the demerger next month. It would be completed, subject to the approval of the National Company Law Tribunal and regulators. She said that the acquisition of Greenwich Associates — a provider of benchmarking data and analytics — in December 2019 had increased the share of international business for the company. Greenwich was the main rival to Coalition, a British analytics company that Crisil bought in 2013 for Rs 250 crore.

Besides this, the global business division includes Pragmatix, which Crisil acquired in 2017. Earlier, the company had expanded globally by acquiring UK-based equity research house Irevna, another London-based advisory company, and a Caribbean ratings agency. Besides India, the company’s businesses now operate from the US, the UK, Argentina, Poland, China, Hong Kong , Singapore, and the UAE.

The restructuring comes at a time when ratings agencies are under fire from regulators — both in India and globally — for failing to highlight default risks in time. A slump in corporate investments and risk aversion among lenders has also impacted the ratings industry.

With seven CRAs offering their services in India, the RBI had warned of ‘ratings shopping’ by companies for long-term bank loans based on indicative ratings given by CRAs, which are not available to banks or investors.

36,['23/01/2020'],Adani aims to be world’s largest solar co by 2025,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Ahmedabad: In a major push towards promoting green energy , billionaire Gautam Adani , chairman of Adani Group , on Wednesday announced plans to become the world’s largest solar power company by 2025 and the largest renewable power company by 2030.

The $15-billion Adani Group, which has, among other sectors, invested heavily in coal mines and thermal power projects, has now drawn out plans to invest over 70% of the budgeted capex of the energy vertical into clean energy and energy-efficient systems.

In a blog posted on a social media platform on Wednesday, Adani said that in 2019 they were ranked as the sixth-largest solar player globally. “And as part of this journey, we are well within reach to be India’s largest renewable energy company by 2020 and one of the top three global solar energy companies by 2021,” he wrote. The group’ existing portfolio of renewable power generating assets presently stands at over 2.5GW. “This is expected to more than double by 2020, with the implementation of 2.9GW under construction capacity and further record three-fold growth touching 18GW by 2025. To make this happen, we have committed to investing over 70% of our budgeted capex of the energy vertical into clean energy and energy-efficient systems,” he wrote. Another key project that has begun taking shape as part of this journey, is the expansion of our 1.3GW state-of-the-art solar cell and module manufacturing plant in Mundra , which will turn into a 3.5GW manufacturing facility, he said.

“We are also in discussions on ventures to enable the world’s only 100% green energy-based chemical manufacturing and data centre facilities,” according to Adani. The group has entered a partnership with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, German chemical giant BASF and Austria’s Borealis to study the feasibility of setting up a $4-billion chemical complex at Mundra. The project, if materialised, would mark the entry of Adani into petrochemicals. The power to be supplied for the project will be using 100% renewable energy.

The diversified conglomerate, with investments in sectors including ports, real estate, defence, city gas distribution, LNG and agri-business, has chalked out massive plans for building data centres across the country. The group has in the past announced to invest Rs 70,000 crore for setting up data centres in Andhra Pradesh.

Adani Group has moved quickly into a position to lead the clean energy transformation taking place not just in India but on the global stage that will see the group building one of the largest integrated energy portfolios, he said. “The age of renewable energy has dawned upon the world faster than most could have anticipated,” Adani wrote. “India has been the founder member that initiated the Global Solar Alliance constituted of 122 countries, and over the past few years, our nation has shown the greatest intent taking some of the most concrete actions for the world to look at it as one of the main the beacons of hope for managing the challenge of climate change.”

A majority of India’s COP 21 climate change goals set for 2030 are expected to be achieved almost a decade earlier, according to Adani. “PM Narendra Modi’s announcement at the 2019 UN conference to further raise India’s share of non-fossil fuel mix to 450GW is easily one of the most ambitious global commitments ever made by any nation. We must all be proud of this.”

He said India’s energy strategy finally has a line of sight on providing consistent 24x7 electricity for all segments of our population. “Efficient, supercritical and ultra-supercritical power plants will be needed to provide baseload power. This will be significantly complemented by capabilities such as renewable sources, natural gas, hydrogen, increasing electrification (EVs), energy efficiency technologies and innovation across the energy value chain,” Adani said. India was well on its way to achieving the optimal mix “perhaps better” than most other large nations in the years that lie ahead, he said.

“Given our goal to become the world’s largest solar power company by 2025 and the world’s largest renewable power company by 2030, we feel confident that we will be able to lead one of the fastest global carbon offsets. We are looking forward to this transformation,” said Adani.

37,['23/01/2020'],‘Amend tax laws to help mining cos sell rough diamonds at SNZs’,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Surat: Even as the country’s second Special Notified Zone (SNZ) for rough diamonds has opened up at the Gems and Jewellery park at Ichhapore, diamantaires will not be able to purchase rough diamonds from the mining company directly. Reason is that the foreign mining companies (FMCs) have not been given any specific exemption under the Income Tax Act, 1961 for sale of rough diamonds from SNZ.

Urging the central government to allow level playing field for the FMCs and its trading arms, the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), an apex body of the diamond industry has asked it to include suitable provisions in its budget proposal. It has demanded providing presumptive turnover linked tax rate of 0.125% for these FMCs to help them sell rough diamonds at the SNZs.

According to GJEPC, the FMCs are permitted to display, trade, auction rough diamonds in the SNZ. While there is no direct tax implications on the display of rough diamonds under the exemption given under section 9(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, there is, however, no specific exemption for sale of rough diamonds from SNZ.

Hence, the rough diamonds are kept only for viewing or for display purpose at the SNZs.

The country’s first India Diamond Trading Centre (IDTC) Special notified Zone was opened in Mumbai in 2015. Many foreign diamond mining companies including De Beers, Alrosa, Rio Tinto have been regularly displaying roughs for viewing here. Later, diamantaires have to place order for the selected goods which the FMCs then ship directly to the company.

The Surat International Diatrade Centre (SIDC) has opened up an SNZ at the Gems and Jewellery park at Ichhapore. Recently, the customs department declared the SIDC SNZ as the customs area for the trading, import and re-export of rough diamonds.

Vice-chairman of GJEPC, Colin Shah said, “SNZs are beneficial for small players in the industry as they get an opportunity to directly view the goods displayed by the mining giants. We have been demanding amendment in the taxation laws, so that there is level playing field for the mining companies like Israel, Belgium and UAE.”

Shah said that the apex body has been demanding presumptive turnover tax since for the past couple of years to help the SNZs turn into trading hubs for rough diamonds. “India is the largest consumer of rough diamonds with small and medium diamantaires taking major benefit of the SNZs,” he added.

Surat: Raghuvir Textile market on Puna-Kumbhariya road has entered Diamond City’s record books by breaking all previous time records of fire incidents. While it’s 40 hours and still counting, Surat firemen continue to battle smoke accompanied by occasional licks of flame that is coming out of around 600-odd shops in the 12-storeyed market.

On the second consecutive day on Wednesday, the fire department had deployed more than 250 staff for the complete cooling down of the market premises that gutted goods worth crores of rupees.

While the firemen are still struggling to put a lid on the mess, more than two-third shops in the complex have been completely turned to ashes with shops mostly on the front side of the building being the worst sufferers in the inferno, said a fire personnel.

About 20 teams comprising 10 firemen each from Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) fire and emergency department have physically entered into the premise and started breaking open the shutters of the closed shops, said Basant Pareek, chief fire officer (CFO). Talking to TOI, he said, “By 2 am on Wednesday the fire had stopped completely. Later, smoke started emanating from certain parts of the market.”

Pareek further said that at certain places, flames were still seen coming out of the shops and so, the fire brigade has flooded all the shops to bring the temperature down. “We did not want to take any chance of fire recurring and decided to perform the exercise in each of the shops,” he added.

An official engaged in the exercise said that the origin of the fire is still unclear. “The materials stored in some of the shops included sarees, dress materials, yarn and tent fabrics, which are highly inflammable. The aluminium elevation in the front of the building created a lot of heat inside the premises and it was difficult to stand even for a minute without protective gears,” the official said.

Fire safety installations must within 30 days

Surat: The Surat Urban Development Authority (SUDA) organised a meeting of builders, CREDAI, architects, engineers, textile owners’ association and Federation of Surat Textile Traders’ Association (FOSTTA) on Wednesday. In the meeting, chairman of SUDA, Banchhanidhi Pani ordered fire safety installations to be implemented in the city, high-risk and high-rise category buildings, within 30 days.

Pani also stated that the builders will have to take special permission and registration for all types of outer elevations in the buildings. All these elevations must have proper ventilation and should be made such that in such emergencies can be opened.

He also instructed to have at least one trained person to act immediately at the time of fire in every high-rise building.

Also, the market is awaiting some of the heavyweights to report their quarterly numbers to gauge further direction.”In Wednesday’s market, HDFC, ICICI Bank and Kotak Bank contributed the most to sensex’s slide, while buying in software stocks, mainly due to weakness of the rupee, cushioned the fall.

TNN

Pune: Maharashtra State Co-operative (MSC) Bank and Rupee Co-operative Bank have submitted a joint proposal to the RBI on January 17 for merger of the latter with MSC Bank . However, according to officials, the RBI could take as much as six months to give its approval to the merger.

The merger proposal, if approved by the RBI, will grant relief to over half-a-million depositors of Rupee Co-operative Bank, who have not been able to access their own deposits since the lender was put under directions in February 2013.

The two banks clarified that the depositors will not lose any money as a result of the proposed merger. “Those with less than Rs 1 lakh in deposits can withdraw the amount within the first year of merger in five tranches of 20% each, at a gap of two months between two withdrawals. And those with more than Rs 1 lakh in deposits can withdraw their money over five years in slabs of 20% per year,” MSC Bank said.

Vidhyadhar Anaskar, chairman, MSC Bank told TOI the RBI wanted the two lenders to submit a joint proposal, so that the process can move faster. “The RBI wanted to know if both bank’s agree to the proposal and terms of merger,” he said.

MSC Bank said it will give 6.5% interest or higher rates on the deposits kept with it after the merger. “This will be the best possible option for the depositors. A liquidation might have meant that those with more than Rs 1 lakh in deposits get only 35% of it. In this case, they will get their entire money even if it is in a phased manner,” said Sudhir Pandit, chairman, board of administrators, Rupee Co-operative Bank.

41,['23/01/2020'],Reconsider decision on MEd course: Patna University to NCTE,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Patna University

PATNA: Taking exception to the recent decision of the National Council of Teacher Education (NCTE) to withdraw its recognition to the MEd course of Patna University ( PU ) from the next academic session (2020-21), the education department has written a letter to the council for reconsideration of its decision.

PU education department head Khagendra Kumar said on Wednesday that the eastern regional committee of NCTE at its meeting held from January 16 to 18 considered all the necessary documents furnished by PU with regard to the requirement for imparting MEd course and decided to withdraw its recognition on the ground that it did not have the required built-up area as per NCTE regulations. The regulations state that an institution running MEd course should have a built up area of 2500 square metres.

What surprises PU authorities most that citing reasons for withdrawal of recognition to the course, the NCTE has pointed out that the built up area is less than that prescribed as per Appendix-V of NCTE Regulations 2014 to run two units of BEd course and one unit of MEd course. They had pointed out that the BEd course is run separately in two different institutions, namely, Patna Training College and Women’s Training College and the MEd course is run by the postgraduate department of education located in a separate building at Dariyapur on Bari Path.

The PU education department head said that “We fulfill all other conditions including the required number of teachers, instructors, laboratory, library and other infrastructural facilities.”

It may be mentioned here that the PU education department is one of the oldest postgraduate departments in the country, serving the needs of teacher educators of this region since 1954. “If the NCTE does not reconsider the case on PU’s request, the university would file a formal application of appeal to the NCTE’s governing council,” said Kumar.

KOLKATA: The KMDA will start conducting soil tests and topographic survey at both ends of Chetla Lockgate Bridge to prepare a report to set up a new bridge. “The study will show how much load it will be able to take and identify the spot for constructing the new elevated corridor,” said an official. The authorities will then come up with an alternative alignment for the new bridge.

The test and survey are scheduled to be taken up from the first week of February and will be completed within 25 days.

Chetla Lockgate Bridge was shut last year after experts found it to be in a very bad shape. KMDA took up emergency temporary repairs and reopened the bridge just before the Pujas. But only light vehicles were allowed on it to prevent a complete traffic shutdown during the festive season.

The bridge is currently being maintained with temporary repairs and constant supervision, but with heavy vehicles permanently banned, its utility has already decreased. “The bridge’s load-taking capacity has decreased drastically. Only light vehicles are allowed to take the bridge, and under constant supervision,” said an official.

KMDA is also engaging an agency to conduct soil test for a new canal bridge over Tolly’s Nulluh between Usha and Bansdroni canal bridge.

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Violation of fire safety norms will lead to imprisonment of up to three months or fine of up to Rs 10,000 as per provisions of the proposed Bihar Fire Services Rules , 2020. The proposals were presented by the home department at a meeting chaired by CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday.

The proposed provisions will make it mandatory for owners of large commercial buildings such as malls and cinema halls to appoint fire safety officers and they will face penal provisions if found violating the rules.

The presentation on the proposed fire safety rules was made by the home department’s additional chief secretary Amir Subhani at the meeting chaired by the CM, during which he asked officials to link the fire safety rules to ‘Jal Jivan Hariyali (JJH)’ mission. Nitish said the JJH mission can be linked with fire services in order to ensure supply of water for dousing fire.

“Common ponds and other sources of water can be used for fulfiling the requirement of water for dousing fire. Ground water should be used only in case of emergency. Environment conservation should be given equal treatment as disaster management and behavioural changes should be introduced accordingly,” a statement released by the government quoted the CM saying.

State fire officer-cum-DIG Pankaj Sinha told TOI: “The rules have been made for effective implementation of Bihar Fire Services Act, 2014. Violation of any provision of the rules can lead to penalty of up to Rs 10,000 or imprisonment of up to three months and Rs 500 per day in case of continuing offence.”

He added: “Similar punishments have been introduced for non-installation of fire-fighting equipment in buildings and not allowing fire officers inside the premises. Till now, we used to conduct fire audits and send advisory to building owners in case they failed to comply with the norms. But these rules have provided “teeth” to the fire department and we can now initiate penal action, if people fail to adhere to fire safety norms.”

44,['23/01/2020'],Holding ‘Free Kashmir’ placard not ‘anti-national’: Siddaramaiah,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Mysuru: The protests seeking to withdraw the sedition case against students of University of Mysore got a shot in the arm on Wednesday with the leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah arguing that holding a ‘Free Kashmir’ placard is not ‘anti-national’ even as he criticised a section of Mysuru advocates’ move not to represent the accused in the case, describing it as ‘illegal.’

He said ‘Free Kashmir’ is a movement to restore normalcy in the troubled Union Territory and it is not seditious in nature. “What is ‘Free Kashmir’ movement? There is prohibitory order imposed under Section 144 of CrPC even now. There is no freedom and a state of emergency exists there. The student has questioned this and asked it to be freed. It is not sedition,” he said.

The sections related to sedition do not apply in the protest that took place at University of Mysore, he said. Prime accused Nalini B is targeted as she is a Dalit. “Indian Constitution has granted her the right to protest, which she has utilized,” he said, adding she has not committed any crime.

The Mysuru Bar Association has resolved not to represent the accused in the case, which, he said, is illegal and goes against the basic tenets of their profession. “Some advocates are not acting as per the law,” he said, adding that when it was questioned, they behaved in an unruly manner. Some lawyers tried to attack advocate Manjula Manasa, former chief of Karnataka State Commission for Women, he claimed, and condemned it.

The former CM said the state government is targeting immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh. While they say the CAA is to help immigrants from Bangladesh, they are at the same time targeting workers from Bangladesh evicting them. The government lacks clarity, he said.

46,['23/01/2020'],Baby wipes market doubles in 5 years,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Driven by new-age ‘supermoms’ who are financially independent, educated and internet-savvy, baby wipes has emerged as a big category. This segment was practically non-existent 10 years ago.Though still nascent, the category has been growing fast over the last couple of years. Data by Euromonitor International reveals that baby wipes doubled in size over five years. According to the market research provider, the size of the baby wipes category increased from a little over Rs 100 crore in 2014 to around Rs 270 crore in 2018. However, it is small compared to the around Rs 5,000-crore baby diapers market.Kimberly-Clark India marketing director Chella Pandyan said, “The wipes category in India has been growing fast over the last couple of years, but remains in a nascent stage of development as far as household penetration is concerned. While hygiene and convenience are the key consumer needs driving adoption, it is the growing availability and access — enabled by more affordable price-points and e-commerce — that is helping expand penetration.” For ‘ Huggies ’ baby wipes made by Kimberly-Clark, according to Pandyan, the primary driver has been the fact that it is made from natural fibres.A study by JL Morison found that financially independent mothers don’t shy away from spending money to buy products for their babies, which provides time as well as convenience for themselves. In the qualitative part of the study, a lot of mothers indicated that they do strive to get some ‘me-time’ for themselves, which is difficult during motherhood phases, especially if they are working. Whenever they get this time, they spend it on socialising, catching up on their sleep, catching up on their hobbies and interests, surfing the net, or spending time with their spouses.JL Morison India group brand manager Nitin Bhandari said, “From a marketer’s point of view, this indicates that mothers are now willing to spend on products that provide them quality, convenience, comfort and safety for their babies.” These ‘supermoms’ are aware about the products and they also have a plethora of choices at their disposal. “While this provides an opportunity to marketers, the challenge is to provide the best quality and benefits at value-for-money prices. One of the biggest examples is the emergence of baby wipes, which did not exist around 10 years ago. Today, it is among the fastest growing categories,” said Bhandari.The research by JL Morison was conducted on a sample size of more than 400 mothers across five cities to understand their usage and attitudes regarding motherhood, babies and the product usage related to the same. The key trends that are driving growth in the baby care category are increasing birth rates, urbanisation, more working mothers, enhanced purchasing power and increased concern for child care.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73544703,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-79959,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/baby-wipes-mkt-doubles-in-5-yrs/articleshow/73531668.cms
47,['23/01/2020'],Kolkata: Officials conduct spot survey for Jadavpur flyover,"This story is from January 23, 2020

The flyover will decongest the perpetually busy Jadavpur police station intersection

KOLKATA: Officials from Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA), RITES, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and Kolkata traffic police officers on Wednesday conducted a spot inspection of the stretch connecting Prince Anwar Shah Road to Lords Bakery More to work on the plans for a flyover that has been planned to go over Jadavpur police station. Sources said RITES has been asked to conduct the soil test.

For the past few years, the authorities have been working on plans for the flyover that will decongest the Jadavpur police station crossing. According to plans, Jibanananda Setu will be extended a little over a kilometre to terminate at Lords Bakery More. Two ramps have been planned at the Jadavpur police station crossing for vehicles coming from EM Bypass intending to move towards either Jadavpur University on the left or towards Dhakuria on the right.

KMDA and Kolkata traffic police will need to sort out a few issues before the plans for the flyover materialize. Officials said there are about three houses close to Jadavpur police station that would obstruct the flyover’s alignment and the authorities will have to work on compensation and rehabilitation.

Cops said they have two requirements — the flyover on the Prince Anwar Shah Road side should not obstruct movement of vehicles towards either Katjunagar or Jodhpur Gardens. The police have also insisted that the three bottlenecks on the the access road from the Bypass-end of the bridge be sorted.

The cops have also wanted to know what kind of help and road blocks will be required during construction of the flyover. “This area witnesses heavy traffic. The Metro Railway has asked us to allot them space at Abhishikta crossing for the upcoming station, but we will need much bigger planning here. We have pointed out that the two constructions cannot be allowed at the same time as that might choke the Prince Anwar Shah Road connector completely,” said an officer.

Varanasi: After the completion of 3D imaging of 43 historical temples, which include those having artistic walls, Kashi Vishwanath temple authorities are set to rope in a company for the restoration of structures unearthed during demolition of 296 buildings to clear decks for Kashi Vishwanath Dham project.

Besides these temples, restoration of Kashi Vishwanath temple will also be carried out.

At least 14 companies took part in ‘expression of interest’ (EOI) session on Tuesday in which a presentation on 3D mapping of temples was made.

According to temple authorities, a provision of Rs 6 crore has been made for restoration of temples which will be completed with the KV Dham project by June 2021.

Talking to TOI on Wednesday, chief executive officer (CEO) of Kashi Vishwanath temple Vishal Singh said, “Proposal for the conservation-cum-restoration of 30 out of 43 temples and other historical structures unearthed during demolition has been finalised.”

“A presentation was made during EOI session on Tuesday in which 14 companies participated. Tender process will be finalized by the first week of February after the companies submit their detailed research report,” he added.

During demolition of buildings to pave way for KV Dham project in 2018, many 18th century temples were found buried under the layers of concrete and plaster.

Threat to KV temple’s architectural marvel was generated after layers of enamel paint were applied 5-6 times on its walls before 2008. A team from IIT-Roorkee was engaged in 2019 to conduct a study on the adverse effects of enamel paint on the temple’s walls.

During its study, the team also conducted 3D imaging of the artistic walls of the temple. After assessing damages, IIT-Roorkee recommended steps required for restoration. After going through study report, Sri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Trust, in its meeting in December, approved the proposal made by IIT-Roorkee.

Kolkata: A human chain will be formed from the north to the south of the city on Republic Day to uphold the values of the Constitution. A meeting was held by United Interfaith Foundation India (UIFI) on Wednesday to finalize plans for it.

Without directly going into the issue of the current narrative of protests against CAA and NRC that has rocked the country, the foundation members said the human chain will be a symbol of unity, equality and solidarity that the Constitution guarantees to the people of the country. In its 70th year, it was once again time to remind everybody what the Constitution stands for.

The chain will start from Golpark and end at the Shyambazar five-point crossing. People will stand on one side of the road holding hands to form the chain that will go straight up to Park Circus and then on to Mullickbazar, cross Sealdah, Rajabazar and end at Shyambazar.

“It is time to celebrate the Constitution and to celebrate the values of equality and brotherhood it upholds,” said Father Thomas D’Souza, the chairperson of the foundation.

The UIFI is an organization consisting of religious leaders and community heads from every denomination, who have come together to take forward the interfaith dialogue for promoting humanity, peace, harmony and brotherhood.

The chain will be formed at noon for 10 minutes. “The Constitution will be read out in several languages at vantage points,” said Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, general secretary of the foundation.

62,['23/01/2020'],Force Motors invests Rs 1k cr over 4 yrs on new platform,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Pune: Commercial vehicle and engine maker Force Motors said it has invested Rs 1,000 crore over four years to develop an entirely new platform on which BS6 commercial vehicles and electric drive train will be based.

“The platforms have been built to enter more sophisticated markets, where the regulations are more stringent...the existing platforms will also continue,” said Force Motors chairman Abhay Firodia.

Force Motors MD Prasan Firodia said the company’s aspiration is to get significantly into global markets with this “modular platform” and bring more vehicles on the platform in the future. The vehicles will be launched on the platform by the end of the year, when the company said it will reveal the technical specifications and the pricing.

The company said that it will be targeting markets in Middle East, Africa, ASEAN and South America, besides India. “About four years ago, we put together a team of 150 engineers to work on an entirely new next-generation platform,” said Prasan Firodia.

The current slowdown in the automotive sector is temporary and should settle in another three quarters, said Abhay Firodia. He said that the sudden change from BS4 to BS6 regime, lack of financing options due to the NBFC crisis were the main reasons why customer interest was not getting converted into sales.

“I must admit that the government is doing a lot of things right but they should generally get out of business. For example, they should sell their stakes in the public sector banks and bring that money to help the industry prosper,” he added.

There will obviously be opposition, he said, from the trade unions and others who will try and protect their comfort zone. “But why should the government protect the non-performers,” he said, citing the example of Air India.

Surat: Ten days after the textile businessman and his son’s would-be mother-in-law eloped, a recording of an audio call they made to a common friend has gone viral on social media.

In the 17 minute audio recording, the couple is heard inquiring about the health of their families without any mention of their location whatsoever. In the audio clip, the couple is heard talking with the man’s two friends where he is heard saying that he has couriered a gift for his daughter from an undisclosed location and that he has also sent some money.

After the call, the businessman’s mobile phone, however, has been on the switch off mode. Family members of both sides now fear that the duo may take some extreme step after their audio call went viral.

The businessman was heard telling his friend that he had gone too far and there was no other option but to elope. “Nothing is clear what will happen next,” the businessman was heard saying, while his friends were heard trying to convince him to avoid taking any extreme step.

Meanwhile, a meeting of the community from which the couple belongs could not take place on Wednesday. A community member informed that the meeting called to discuss various community issues and not just the case of the runaway couple, will be held sometime in the near future. However, sources within the community informed that the meeting is likely to turn stormy over the ‘love’ issue.

caption

Surat: From ‘how’ , the fire that is still not ‘under control’ at the Raghuvir Celeum textile market on Puna-Kumbhariya road, has turned into a ‘who’. While the exact cause of fire is still unclear, the needle of suspicion now points dangerously to some major human mischief.

Be that as it may, the Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Limited (DGVCL) has categorically stated that the building had no power supply as it had been severed after the small incident of fire that was reported from the market on January 8.

Fire started at about 3am when the market was shut and without any presence of humans. Slowly it developed into an inferno and engulfed the entire market, even before the fire fighters could reach the spot and start their operation.

Managing director of DGVCL, Yogesh Choudhary told TOI, “Power supply was severed in the building after a small fire incident reported on January 8. Just two days ago, electrical engineer had visited the premises for internal wire checking and power was resumed for a short time only. Prima facie there was no power supply on the day when the fire took place.”

Choudhary further said that the discom is doing an MRI of the power supply of the entire area where the building is located. “ We will also do an MRI of electricity metres and transformers to know whether any sort of power was supplied to the building or not,” he said.

According to Choudhary, overloading in the transformer results in fire in the internal wiring of the premises when power is drawn illegally from anywhere. The DGVCL is also getting data of the power consumption pattern of the entire area to find out if there was any such overloading in the transformer.

“It is very easy to blame DGVCL, but when we have not supplied the power at all, how can it be responsible. Without power, there cannot be a short circuit. This building houses all types of materials that are highly inflammable. However, we will be able to ascertain facts only after the investigation is over. At present, the firemen are still working and we will be able to enter the building only after everything settles down,” Choudhary added.

A senior fire officer on condition of anonymity shared his suspicions with TOI. “Like many other small fires in textile segments, this fire too looks suspicious. We have witnessed large number of small and big fires where loss of life has not taken place, but results in heavy loss of material. The reason may be that the traders want to take benefit of the insurance claim. Interestingly, such fires have been witnessed every year for the past three years during the months of January, February and March,” he said.

65,['23/01/2020'],HC to hear broadcasters’ response to Trai on Jan 30,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Swati Deshpande | TNN

Mumbai: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( Trai ) has informed the Bombay high court that its new tariff order of 2020 is “to ensure that an effective a la carte choice was available to distributors without being handicapped by the perverse pricing of bouquets by broadcasters at wholesale level”. The new order caps pay channel prices at Rs 12.

Television broadcasters had recently approached the HC to challenge the new Trai regulation. On Wednesday, after former attorney general of India Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for one of the broadcasters, sought time to file a rejoinder to the price curb justifications given by Trai, the HC adjourned to January 30.

Trai also sent 1,700 documents electronically, which need to be analysed, said Rohatgi before a bench of Justices S C Dharmadhikari and Riyaz Chagla. “We are challenging the constitutionality of the Trai action, which is absolutely arbitrary,” he said. And when the bench asked why a rejoinder is necessary, Janak Dwarkadas , counsel for one of the nine petitioners, said the authority has filed a 100-page reply that needs to be rejoined. The court was not keen on allowing an NGO, Telecom Watchdog, to intervene and told its counsel Raju Subramanian that the matter was in good hands. The Trai affidavit, filed through Dhir & Dhir Associates, said, “It was expected that broadcasters will consider consumer requirements and make bouquets of channels demanded by subscribers. However, analysis indicates that the freedom given to broadcasters has been misused.”

The Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) and other broadcasters — including a films & TV producers’ guild, Sony Pictures, Star India, Zee, Disney India, Asianet and TV18 — had earlier this month challenged the Trai regulation. The new regulation requires channels in a bouquet to be priced no more than Rs 12, a drop from the current cap of Rs 19.

Trai, which said it is the “statutory and expert authority …to protect interest of telecom service providers, broadcasters and consumers”, contended that its decision is “lawful” and cannot be assailed “on the ground that it benefits some or hurts others”.

It said that the “focus of broadcasters has been to push as many channels into a bouquet rather than give a choice to consumers on a la carte basis”. The authority said the broadcasters’ practice “defeats the very purpose of the 2017 regulatory framework to protect the sacrosanct right of consumers to choose and pay for only those channels they want to watch as informed consumers”. “Even some free-to-air channels were converted to pay channels” to make them part of a bouquet and “pushed to consumers along with popular channels”, said Trai.

The regulator said the price cap is only to ensure consumers can easily access individual channels, in an a la carte mode, as was intended, and not just bouquets of channels offered by broadcasters. Trai cited a 2018 Supreme Court ruling, which said subscribers are forced to take bouquets if a la carte rates are higher.

The broadcasters’ foundation contended, “A prescription of ceiling of MRP of Rs 12 on a la carte channels forming part of a bouquet or for that matter, fixation of any ceiling… is an invasion in broadcaster’s right to enter into commercial contracts for exploitation of free speech.”

But the Trai affidavit said when in 2017 the framework was implemented with no cap on permissible discount on sum of a la carte channels in a bouquet, it was expected that the broadcasting industry would own more responsibility and price their channels accordingly. But Trai said its main concern is that the “uptake of channels on an a la carte basis still continued to be very low as compared to bouquet subscriptions” and attributes it to the “highly disproportionate a la carte rates of channels”.

It also said that the “twin conditions will not affect flexibility of broadcasters to form bouquets as the flexibility to decide MRP of channels and bouquets continue to rest with them”. It further said the bouquets comprise some popular and many non-popular channels, yet “some broadcasters have declared the MRP of their bouquet as equal to or even less” than that of a single channel in it.

Trai had set January 15 as deadline to publish new tariff, which would come into effect from March 1 this year. In its reply, it termed the claims of the broadcasters that it would be put to extreme hardship as it would need to sign thousands of agreements for publishing their new rates as “patently false”. The amendment in regulations only requires “change of certain rate card annexures to the main agreement”. “The (digital) ecosystem is quite efficient to adopt such changes,” said Trai.

66,['23/01/2020'],Saroli textile mart is another sitting bomb,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Fast emerging new textile hub has about 26 markets and 20,000 shops

Surat: If Saroli village , some 15km away from Surat city , on the Puna-Kumbhariya road doesn’t learn a quick lesson from Raghvir Textile market fire, it will prove to be another disaster waiting to happen.

In this fast emerging new textile hub, about 26 markets, housing more than 20,000 shops have come up, almost all of them built in the same design with huge front elevation using highly combustible material including aluminium.

Out of 26 markets here, 18 have been built after 2014 which have the same design fault that made fire fighters face serious problem in dousing the fire in Raghuvir market. Even high intensity water sprayers were not able to spray required amount of water inside the burning building due to the presence of this outer elevation that was added primarily to serve as an adornment.

According to fire officials, the heat generated from the burning of the elevation material goes up to 600 degrees, making it impossible for humans to enter the building. On the first day, no firemen could try to enter the building — they could only after hours of fighting late at night — as flames kept bursting from all the directions.

According to Naresh Agarwal, spokesman for the CREDAI Surat and Saroli builders’ association, Saroli is the new extension for the textile market in Ring Road. The idea behind developing Saroli was to decongest areas like Ring Road, Salabatpura and Sahara Darwaja, which houses more than 165 textile markets. However, the principle of safety first has been neglected in many buildings. He also agreed that the elevations are made up of cheap aluminium sheets, pipes and glass are only for the purpose of adornment.

Agarwal further said that the builders association is ready to make any alterations suggested by the authority concerned and also follow the principle of safety first at all work places. “Such cheap combustible material not only catches fire easily and helps spread rapidly. People have used such materials only for cost-cutting, flouting the rule book. Even the internal design in some of the buildings are faulty,” he added.

Devkishan Manghani, chairman of Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s (SGCCI) textile committee said, “After the major Orchid textile market fire in 2014, Raghuvir textile market fire is the biggest one in the history. This has shaken the textile traders community at large. Goods worth crores of rupees have been burnt to ashes. If only there wasn’t the outer elevation, the market could have been saved.”

The protesters in Ekbalpore on Wednesday

By: Biplab Mondal

KOLKATA: Over a hundred women, including homemakers, professionals and students, are staging a sit-in in Nawab Ali Park in Ekbalpore for the past four days, demanding a rollback of CAA and NRC. The women fasted on Wednesday morning hoping for a Supreme Court intervention and broke their fast in the evening with a promise to carry on their protests till the apex court decides on the issue.

Shakil Akhtar, a 66-year-old medical practitioner, and one of the primary organizers, said, “We were born in this country. We have been voting in the elections for the past several years. Kolkata has always been home to all religions and thoughts. So why has this law been passed? This must be reconsidered,” Akhtar said, adding that the collective angst of the people is being reflected in the Nawab Ali Park protest. “We condemn this law and will continue our protests,” said Akhtar, who is the IMA’s Kidderpore branch secretary.

Social worker Shaukat Ali Siddiqui said, “The Saheen Bagh protest has encouraged us to take a stand. For many, it is now or never. The protesters here are from every faith and everyone is welcome here. Women are leading the protests and this will continue till the apex court decides on the issue. People from all walks of life have joined our demonstration. This law is ultimately going to harm everybody. The protests will continue.”

Iqra Siddiqui, a medical student, joined the protesters on Wednesday. “The politics over religion by the ruling party in the Centre should be condemned. India has always been about inclusiveness,” she said.

PATNA: The Bihar Chemist and Druggists Association called off their strike late Wednesday evening after health minister Mangal Pandey and principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar assured them to look into their demands.

Earlier, srugstores in the city remained closed as the association had called three-day statewide strike from Wednesday. The association accused the drug inspectors of harassing the medicine shop owners in the name of inspection and cancelling their licences on minor issues.

Association president PK Singh said, “The problem of pharmacists is not new as there are just four pharmacy colleges in Bihar. The state government knows about the shortage of pharmacists. So, the government should relax the rules and allow one pharmacist to handle at least ten drugstores.” earlier, Singh staged a dharna on Govind Mitra Road.

Association member Tarun Kumar said they had exempted drugstores at government and private hospitals. However, that was not enough as many people could not get medicines they needed from the hospital stores. Sexagenarian Sahdeo Pandey was waiting in a queue outside the medicine store at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) to purchase medicines for his wife Phulwanti Devi, who was suffering from arthritis and chest problem. Of total 11 medicines prescribed by the doctor there, Sahdeo got only three. “I do not know where to go now. All the shops outside are closed,” he said.

A pharmacist at PMCH, Sitesh Kumar, said the number of buyers had increased by 20%. “Few people are also coming with the prescription of some private doctors,” he said.

As part of your cost control measures, you have shut down your Thailand subsidiary. Will other overseas subsidiaries also face the axe? What about Tata Daewoo for instance which is facing headwinds in Korea?

Are you capping your investment plans to ride out the slowdown?

CHENNAI: With Altroz and its new BS6 ready passenger vehicle range, Tata Motors is readying itself to ride out the slowdown and the transition to BS6 smoothly. In a chat, Guenter Butschek, CEO & MD, Tata Motors, talks about electric plans, cost cutting and more. Excerpts:Not yet. In principle all future launches will provide an EV option. We already are offering a Tigor EV, a Nexon EV and an Altroz EV. All the new products based on the Alfa architecture will provide an electric variant. As for the Omega architecture, this too is battery electric protected. We had in fact debuted a concept in Geneva 2018 that was based on Omega architecture. So it’s technically feasible but not commercially viable. We would like to promote electric as a mainstream solution. The sweet spot in India to accelerate the adoption of EV is the segment below or just above 4 metres.Harrier has done well and December in fact was the best ever month for the model in retail and wholesale. The Harrier upgrade will be presented in the Auto Expo. Like the others, the BS6 version will be packed with other features including automatic transmission and a sunroof. Harrier is a flagship product and needs its own space. But there is a 7-seater variant on the Omega architecture which is in the making which will be launched in the market soon. There will be more products in 3-5 years to improve market reach. The two new architectures will have 12-14 products, taking our market coverage to 90%. We are looking at a larger share of the upper end of the market coverage.We took a call on our subsidiaries like Thailand. As for Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle, yes the economic environment in Korea is very tough. Medium heavy trucks have declined, competition brisk but Tata Daewoo is in strong recovery mode. It is a strong performing asset which complements Tata Motors truck range in medium and heavy duty segments.The last 9 months has demanded strong focus on cash management. We are focusing on receivables but also on spend. There is serious review going on and we are controlling not cutting our spend.

PATNA: Hailing the state cabinet’s decision to pay the arrears of 7th Pay Commission to the teachers of colleges and universities in state without waiting for reimbursement of 50% share from the University Grants Commission (UGC), the Federation of University Teachers ’ Associations of Bihar (Futab) has thanked both chief minister Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi .

Futab’s working president Kanhaiya Bahadur Singh and general secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh have, however, drawn the attention of the state education department towards denial of arrears payment for 15 months from January 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017 without any reason.

They pointed out that the revised UGC payscale has been implemented all over the country with effect from January 2016 and the central government has also agreed to reimburse the 50% of the difference of arrears with effect from January 2016 itself. Then, there is no justification in withholding payment of arrears difference for 15 months, they said.

They also expressed their resentment over the actual implementation of the 7th payscale and consequent release of government grants to only four universities in the state till date. While the notification for payment of revised pay of Pataliputra and Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University was issued in October last year, another notification of B N Mandal University-Madhepura and Patna University was issued a few days ago.

They alleged that this selective approach is discriminatory and demanded the release of adequate funds to all the universities in the state for uniform implementation of revised UGC payscales to the teachers and non-teaching staff and also the revised pension to all the retired staff with effect from January 2016 as per government notification.

(Representative image)

BENGALURU: Singapore investment company Temasek , along with Swedish major EQT , has set up a platform called O2 Power to develop and acquire renewable energy assets in areas like solar and wind energy. The two investment firms have committed $500 million in equity for the venture, which is targeting 4 gigawatts of installed capacity in the coming years.

The Gurgaon-based company will look at both greenfield project development and acquisitions, as it will also be able to leverage the equity commitment to raise debt. Temasek has a portfolio of $11 billion in India across both public and private companies. For EQT, this will be the first investment in the country.

O2 is being headed by Parag Sharma, former chief operating officer at ReNew Power, another platform play in the renewables space that was founded by former finance minister Yashwant Sinha’s son Sumant Sinha and was backed by Goldman Sachs. Other members of the top management are also from ReNew, which has built a capacity of 4.3 gigawatts since it was founded in 2011.

Ramesh Pokhriyal

NEW DELHI: Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association ( JNUTA ), in an open letter to human resource development (HRD) minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘ Nishank ’, has criticised him for not acknowledging the January 5 violence on the campus.

Referring to a PTI interview where Pokhriyal had said the students’ demand to sack the vice-chancellor was “not reasonable,” JNUTA said it was the HRD ministry which had “acknowledged the inability of the VC to initiate any dialogue with students. MHRD effectively reiterated the same understanding when it had to step in once again to initiate discussions on December 10 and 11”.

Claiming that VC M Jagadesh Kumar had refused to even attempt a solution, JNUTA asked Pokhriyal if he shouldn’t hold the VC responsible for the “very avoidable” disruption of academic activities. The association enclosed letters from over 2,100 academics from across the world seeking the VC’s removal. He should be removed “on the ground of his indefensible criminal misconduct”, JNUTA claimed.

CHENNAI: Thanks to a close-knit community of SaaS entrepreneurs giving back to the sector, a large pool of quality young talent, and pioneers like Intellect Design Arena, Ramco Systems and Zoho nurturing upstarts, Chennai has rightfully become India’s ‘SaaS capital’.

While the city’s conservatism makes it ideal to scale profitability-oriented software businesses, SaaS founders’ focus to create an employee-first culture has earned commitment of talent and helped bring in stability.

There are almost 650 SaaS startups in Chennai, and the city is spearheading the ‘product wave’ currently underway in Indian IT. Recording more than $1 billion in revenue, employing more than 15,000, and with over $600 million raised in funding, Chennai is already home to two SaaS unicorns – Zoho and Freshworks — and others such as Uniphore, Mad Street Den, Kissflow ChargeBee and Crayon Data are set to soon join the elite club.

A recent research by Venture Intelligence and NASSCOM found that Zoho, Take Solutions, Intellect Design, Ramco and FSS have grown revenues at a three-year compounded rate of 19%, while companies in the next 10 positions (the likes of Freshworks, Kissflow, GoFrugal and others) are growing even faster at 29%.

While industry trackers say there has never been a better time to start a global SaaS startup out of Chennai, the ecosystem is short of product talent at mid to senior levels. “We don’t have enough tech and product talent for the growth spurt,” says Cisco’s Muthukrishnan.

Chargebee’s Subramanian agrees. “We do miss having the abundance of talent that has been through growth cycles. But some talented people who are now moving back to India,” he says. Kissflow’s Sambandam credits Chennai-based SaaS entities for product building and inbound marketing skills, but believes they need an ‘Apple-style’ brand building capability, and sales skills to land large deals.

Aarushi Sharma awarded at a ceremony held at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi

MEERUT: President Ram Nath Kovind awarded the Bal Shakti Puraskar to speech and hearing impaired badminton champions -- Aarushi Sharma and Vinayak Bahadur -- from Meerut at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Wednesday. Aarushi and Vinayak – students of Dewan Public School and Shanti Niketan Vidyapeeth, respectively -- have won laurels for the country earlier. While Aarushi has won the bronze medal in the 5th Asian Pacific Deaf Badminton Championship, Vinayak has won four gold medals at the national level.

President Kovind conferred the Bal Shakti Puraskar to 49 children in the age group of 5-18 years in a ceremony held at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi.

The Bal Shakti Puraskar is awarded to children in the fields of innovation, social service, scholastic, sports, art and culture and bravery. The award consists of cash prize of Rs 1 lakh, a medal, a certificate, a citation and a tablet.

A Class IX student of Dewan Public School, Aarushi was born with hearing impairment. She had undergone a cochlear implant at the age of three years, after which she has limited hearing ability. She started playing at the age of nine, and aims to participate in the Olympics and continue to play the game, which gives her confidence that she is no less than others.

“It is a matter of extreme pride for us that our child was rewarded by the President. We will continue to support her throughout and we are sure that she will do the nation proud one day,” said Bal Krishan, Aarushi’s father.

At the national level, Vinayak Bahadur has bagged four gold medals, three silver medals and one bronze medal. He also bagged many medals at the state level. Vinayak’s parents and grandmother, too, are speech and hearing impaired. Khagesh Bahadur, grandfather of Vinayak, said, “He started playing at the age of seven and ever since there has been no looking back. We hope that he will achieve much more in future.”

The two students from Meerut were awarded for their excellence in the field of sports.

Congress workers burn effigies of BJP’s Gopal Bhargava and Badrilal Yadav to protest against remarks against R... Read More

Bhopal: The state Congress on Wednesday reacted strongly to former BJP minister Badrilal Yadav’s comment on Rajgarh collector Nidhi Nivedita, saying BJP leaders were behaving like Kauravas.

“Badrilal Yadav’s statement is offensive, indecent and an assault on the dignity of women. It shows the mentality of the RSS-BJP combine and the kind of attitude they have for women,” said state Congress media department chairperson Shobha Oza.

Party workers burned an effigy of Yadav in front of the state PCC office on Wednesday evening. “BJP is perpetuating its distasteful offensive against women administrative officers of Rajgarh. After Sunday’s incident, when a woman officer was pulled by her hair, BJP should have taken punitive action on its party workers. But instead of initiating action, their leaders are protecting the culprits. This reveals the hollowness of BJP’s slogans of ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ and ‘Naari Samman’,” Oza said.

Party spokesman and chief minister Kamal Nath’s media convener Narendra Saluja said, “This degraded comment of a BJP former minister of state is an insult to women. The BJP leader should apologise for it. People who make such comments should be shown the door by the party.” Later, he tweeted: “This dirty comment on a woman collector was made in the presence of Shivrajji (former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan), Rakeshji (BJP state president Rakesh Singh), Gopal Bhargava (LOP), and the leaders were smiling.”

PCC spokesman Durgesh Sharma compared BJP to the Kauravas of The Mahabharata. “The arrogance of Kauravas was crushed. Kauravas had made the same mistake that the BJP leadership is making. The offensive words used by Badrilal Yadav today show the mentality, character and ideology of BJP. They will get a befitting reply from the people of Madhya Pradesh.”

PCC media cell vice-president Abhay Dubey argued that “BJP’s main intention was to disrupt communal harmony in Rajgarh”. “BJP had already taken out a rally in Rajgarh in support of CAA in the last week of December and permission was given by collector Nivedita. When BJP again wanted permission for a second pro-CAA rally, the collector said it can be given after January 26 because an incident had occurred in Rajgarh on Republic Day,” he explained.

Dubey said the collector imposed Section 144 when BJP began spreading misinformation on social media. “The women officers, reviewing arrangements in the communally-sensitive Rajgarh district, were surprised to find some people were adamant on violating prohibitory orders and staging a protest. Both women officials tried to convince the protesters but some BJP leaders assaulted the deputy collector and pulled her hair after which the collector intervened to control the situation. The collector has the authority to use force and remove illegal assembly of people which may disrupt peace,” he said.

Indore: Dog bite cases in the city have increased by over 30 per cent in past three years. As per records of Hukumchand Polyclinic (Lal Asptaal), 32,444 dog bite cases were reported in 2019 as compared to 24,151 in 2017.

Hospital officials said that there is an increase of 34 per cent in number of dog bite cases reported in the hospital in past three years. Hospital attends at least 60-70 patients of dog bite every day, hospital in charge Dr Ashutosh Sharma said.

“Over 2000 fresh cases of dog bites are attended in the hospital every month, and more than 50 per cent of these patients come from areas like Chandan Nagar, Dwarkapuri, Khajrana, Banganga, Srinagar, and MR-10,” Sharma told TOI.

He said that 80 per cent of the cases are from urban part of the city, while 20 per cent patients come from rural areas like Depalpur, Mhow etc.

“We have noticed an increase in dog bite cases in city, and we also have to maintain stock of rabies vaccines and injections in the hospital,” he said, adding that efforts should be intensified to control increasing population of stray dogs in city.

Refuting the hospital’s claims Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) officials said that most of the cases were reported from rural areas particularly those out of municipal limits where there is lack of awareness among citizens. “Efforts are being made under animal birth control (ABC) programme to control dog population,” said IMC’s ABC programme in charge Dr Uttam Yadav.

Animal lovers in city referred this increase as an outcome of seasonal aggression, hormonal imbalance caused due to sterilization and cruel act such as beating etc. by locals.

“There is a need to create awareness among citizens on how to deal with stray dogs. Use of herbal medicines can be a solution to keep stray dogs calm,” suggested Priyanshu Jain, an animal activist.

She also suggested for dedicated space in certain areas where dog lovers can feed stray dogs as hunger is also a reason that makes them aggressive, and prompt them to attack on passersby.

The civic body estimates stray dog population in city to be around 91,000, and a fifteen-month deadline has been fixed by IMC to sterilize all stray dogs in city. “We are doing our best with whatever resources we have been able to produce and aim to control the increasing population of stray dogs within a year or so,” added officials.

Indore: For the academic session 2020-21, Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya (DAVV) will not keep entrance test for all the courses under one umbrella. Instead of centralized exams, the varsity has decided to split the entrance tests in three categories.

After last year’s Common Entrance Test (CET) fiasco, the varsity has decided to set up three examination committees to conduct entrance tests.

While professional courses will be conducted through CET, the conventional courses will be conducted through department-level examinations and MTech and ME courses will be in the third category.

In the meeting which was conducted with all the heads of University Teaching Department (UTD) on Wednesday, DAVV vice-chancellor Dr Renu Jain asked suggestions on courses that should be included in CET.

“Till 2018, examinations for various courses were divided into different categories. But, last year when the varsity tried to club it, it got backfired so the varsity has decided to divide the courses again this year,” Jain told TOI.

The dates for CET have not yet been decided. But the varsity has begun with the segregation of the courses that will be put in CET and non-CET bracket.

“If we want to conduct the online examination, we will have to also ensure that a trusted company conducts it. To ensure smooth admissions this year, we will have to begin the process well in advance as a good firm requires time otherwise in last minute only the non-reliable companies would be there,” said DAVV spokesperson Dr Chandan Gupta.

Every year, the varsity used to conduct the examination in June which had been shifted to May for a couple of years and last year it was shifted back to third week of June for courses of all the 14 UTDs.

Last year the CET exam was held for admission in 65 courses at 50 centres in 24 cities for over 3000 seats. This year the number of seats is likely to increase.

Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Biaora on Wednesday

Bhopal: BJP on Wednesday held a massive protest in Rajgarh with the demand to register FIR against the district collector and officials involved in alleged assault of party workers during a pro-CAA rally on Sunday. The party leaders said the incident shows that ‘Jawaharlal Nehru University virus’ has also entered the district.

“I have heard that ‘JNU virus’ has also entered Rajgarh. I came to know that the district collector Nidhi Nivedita has studied in JNU. The public of Rajgarh better knows how to eliminate the virus,” said BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayavargiya, during the protest rally in Rajgarh-Biaora town.

Comparing Sunday’s incident with the JNU protests, the BJP leader further said, “In JNU, the students raise anti-national slogans and also often insult the Tricolour there. Here too, our workers carrying Tricolour were humiliated by government officials, which is a sign of the JNU culture.”

BJP had announced to launch an agitation against the Congress government over the Rajgarh incident in which two senior women officials took on some unruly protesters, allegedly for misbehaving with them while trying to take out a pro-CAA rally by defying prohibitory orders under Section 144.

In video clips of the Sunday’s incident, Nivedita can be purportedly seen slapping a man and the deputy collector taking on some men who were part of the rally in Biaora. BJP leaders said that they will move court if a case is not registered against Nivedita. The party had also sent a fact-finding team on Monday to assess the cause of the incident. Later, party top leaders decided to reach Rajgarh to register FIR against the officials involved in the assault of its workers.

On Wednesday afternoon, BJP state president Rakesh Singh, former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Vijayavargiya and Leader of Opposition (LoP) Gopal Bhargava reached Rajgarh to ensure that an FIR be registered against Nivedita and other officials. They also held a vehicle rally, with top leaders greeting people on a truck and addressed a huge public gathering.

Making a scathing attack on the Congress-led Kamal Nath government, former CM Chouhan said that BJP workers will not remain silent. “The officials who had assaulted our workers will face consequences”, he said.

“Who gave you (collector) permission to beat (BJP) workers who were peacefully demonstrating with Tricolours in their hands? Don’t be egoistic, else your ego will be crushed. In which law is it written that a person carrying the Indian flag should be beaten up? This would be the last nail in the coffin of the Kamal Nath government,” said Chouhan.

The former CM further hit out at the Congress government and said, “Listen Kamal Nath! We will burn your Lanka to ashes. BJP workers do not tease anyone, but when someone teases us, we do not spare them. Never take BJP workers lightly, otherwise you (Congress) will have to pay a very heavy price,” said an agitated Chouhan.

Chouhan also said that if cops refuse to take complaint against the administrative officials, the BJP leaders would reach the police station to lodge the FIR. After his threat, police officers reached the stage and took the complaint against the collector and deputy collector.

Rakesh Singh and LoP Bhargava also called upon the workers to continue with their awareness campaign in support of the CAA. Singh said that BJP workers will hit the road and the struggle against the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh will continue.

BIJNOR: A 30-year-old man was killed by his younger brother who attacked him with a sharp object over family strife on Tuesday night.

The matter came to light after the family approached the police on Wednesday to file an FIR against the accused who fled from the spot soon after the incident.

The incident occurred when Alauddin who used to work as an artisan at a handicraft factory in Nagina reached home on Tuesday night. It took place at Laal Saray mohalla of Nagina town. The police are probing the case and investigating the reason behind the murder.

Alauddin’s father Mohammad Sirajuddin said, “There was tension between my elder son Alauddin and his wife Tamanna. That night, he was beating his wife, and my younger son Safruddin came to her rescue. He took up the matter with his elder brother. This led to a heated argument among the two brothers. Safruddin stabbed Alauddin in the stomach and left.”

“Alauddin collapsed. There was a lot of blood loss. We took him to a Nagina-based hospital where doctor declared him as brought dead,” Sirajuddin added.

Meanwhile, Nagina station house officer (SHO), Rajesh Tiwari said, “Police have registered a case against Safruddin under section 302 of IPC. He is still at large and will be arrested soon. Prima facie, Safruddin killed his brother over family strife. Probe is on.”

Rajnath Singh

MEERUT: In a bid to allay the fear of Muslims over amended citizenship law, Union defence minister Rajnath Simgh said here on Wednesday that anyone who is a citizen of India won’t be touched after its implementation. Addressing a rally in support of the CAA , he said “Unko (Muslims) koi chimte se bhi chhoo nahi sakta hai, (nobody can touch them)"", adding that even Gandhiji wanted citizenship for persecuted minorities of neighbouring countries.

""There are certain forces which want to create a divide bteween Hindus and Muslims on the issue of CAA. These forces have vested interests in creating a rift between the communities. I appeal to everyone that communal tension on religious lines should not be created,"" Rajnath later tweeted after the rally held in Meerut’s Shatabdi Nagar area.

Addressing the rally, he said: “Gandhi ji didn’t want the partition of India on religious lines but it did happen. So, it becomes our duty to be sensitive towards the interests of persecuted minorities in those countries. They should be given citizenship. Even Mahatama Gandhi wanted citizenship for persecuted minorities comprising Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis, Jains.”

“In 2003, former PM Dr Manmohan Singh also reiterated the need for it during his speech in Rajya Sabha. We are only following what they wanted. Have we done some crime by doing so,” said Singh, who was flanked by state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh another Union minister and Muzaffarnagar MP Sanjeev Balyan, Party’s West UP in charge Ashwani Tyagi, BJP former state president Laxmikant Bajpai and local MP Rajender Agarwal.

The defence minister said that those from minority community who are living in pitiable conditions in Pakistan are mainly Dalits and the poor. “Why should anyone have problem with an Act that provides them relief?” he asked, adding “We are asked why Muslims from other countries are not given citizenship?”

“ Let me tell them that this Act is made for those victims who are facing religious persecution in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. These nations are not secular countries. They are Islamic countries but India is not a Hindu country and is a secular country. And religious persecution can take place only in a country which is a religious state that is why we included non-Muslims in the CAA and not Muslims,” he explained.

Accompanied by his supporters, Lovely went from one house to another, reliving the times of Dikshit government

NEW DELHI: The densely populated lanes and bylanes of Chander Puri and Kailash Nagar were abuzz with activity on Wednesday as Congress candidate from Gandhi Nagar , Arvinder Singh Lovely , carried out his door-to-door campaign.

Lovely seemed to be at ease in the two localities as he mingled freely with the locals and conversed with them in Punjabi. These areas are dominated by Muslims but have a sizeable population of Sikhs and Punjabis as well. Many refugees from Pakistan also stay here.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

Accompanied by his supporters, as Lovely went from one house to another, people discussed with him the “good old days” of the Sheila Dikshit government when he was the transport minister.

As the former MLA moved around in the slum area, his connect with residents was evident with the elderly and women rushing to garland and shake hands with him. Said 60-year-old Rajpati, who has been living in the area for decades, “Lovely can be approached easily in case of any problem. He is the one who installed the underground reservoir when we did not have drinking water facility.” Rajpati added while pointing out to an uneven patch, “Look at the condition of the roads now.”

Lovely reciprocated their affection by hugging some and putting his hand around shoulders of a few others. Young men and children raised slogan of Na jaat par na baat par, mohar lagegi haath par even as they grooved to the dhol beats.

Sealing is a major issue in Gandhi Nagar. Lovely refers to it as “illegal sealing”. “These are household industries but often sealed by the officials claiming missing certificates. The area lacks facilities and still has the same number of schools, underground reservoirs, community centres, sewer lines and electric metres, which was there six years back,” said Lovely.

Lovely, who has been a four-time MLA from the constituency from 1998 to 2013, will contest against Dipu Chaudhary from AAP and BJP’s Anil Bajpai this assembly polls.

“Residents of the area are not even aware of the current MLA’s office. But people know Lovely’s office and house by heart. We would invite him home on occasions like birthday and housewarming, and he never said no. Development work has not seen much progress in the past few years and the condition of Naala road has only gone from bad to worse,” claims Jitendra Yadav, a DTC employee and a local resident.

89,['23/01/2020'],District sees rise in number of girls born in 2019,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Indore: The district has witnessed rise in number of girl child born in 2019, lifting sex ratio at birth (SRB) by 10 points. Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act (PCPNDT) Cell in district has recorded female delivery rate at 943 girls on 1000 boys in the last calendar year.

Based on data from 168 government and private hospitals of the district, PCPNDT cell reported a total of 65,229 deliveries --- 33,130 boys and 31,247 girls and 852 still births in last year.

Government hospitals reported 33,933 deliveries (951 SRB) while private hospitals reported of total 31,296 deliveries (935 SRB).

In 2018, PCPNDT Cell had recorded birth of only 933 girls/1000 boys and a jump of 10 points in a year was ‘arguably’ a great achievement, experts said.

The cell, in 2011, had made showing of identity proof compulsory for pregnant women undergoing sonography to check illegal sex determination. It had strengthened the system by installing active tracker devices in the machines in 2013.

As per official records, the district had witnessed 862 SRB in 2010-11, 871 in 2011-12, 871 in 2012-13 and 907 girls/1000 boys in 2014 (calendar year). PCPNDT had even claimed to record SRB of 945 girls/1000 boys in 2015 but in next three years, the figure dropped to 940 in 2016, 936 in 2017 and 933 girls/1000 boys in 2018.

This had raised many questions on working of the Cell. “We are keeping a close vigil on illegal abortions and sex determination and that is the reason behind improving sex ratio at birth,” Cell in-charge Satish Joshi told TOI.

He said that a separate portal has been created to maintain records of number of sonographies carried out on pregnant women through Form-F while all gynaecologists have been instructed to furnish details of the number of pregnant women they have examined

Indore: Government agencies have launched hunt for warehouses expecting higher output of onion this Rabi season.

National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED), an apex organisation of marketing cooperatives for agricultural produce, is looking to collaborate with private warehouses to ensure long lasting storage of bulb.

“Onion output is seen up this season and with an aim to ensure better storage facility, we have developed two warehouses in Madhya Pradesh. We are looking to collaborate with private warehouses to accommodate maximum produce,” said NAFED project manager SN Jha.

NAFED is targeting to store around 15,000 MT of onions this season in Madhya Pradesh at different production centres. It has developed two warehouses at Ujjain and Astha with a capacity of 3000 MT and 9000 MT respectively.

Supply of onions are likely to gain pace from mid-February with an estimated 45,000 tonnes likely to reach to the spot market by January-end, officials said.

With bumper crop, onion prices will witness massive decline. Higher output is expected this Rabi season due to expansion of area under cultivation by farmers and conducive weather. According to horticulture officials, farmers expanded the area under onion cultivation to 1.5 lakh hectares and output is estimated around 36 lakh tonnes. Of it, Indore division is likely to contribute over 9 lakh tonnes.

Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Harisabzi Vayapari Sangh president Mohan Singh Goud said, “Dealers are not booking bulk onions because prices are expected to fall as spot supplies are likely to pick up in coming weeks. Onion production and quality both are good this season since weather remained conducive throughout.”

Last year, onion- the staple diet in almost every household - brought tears due to skyrocketing prices. In the markets of Indore, onion had touched a record high of Rs 105 per kg.

HYDERABAD: Claiming to have unearthed a major land scam in Amaravati, the Andhra Pradesh police has revealed that some of the poorest people in the state have been shown as owners of land running into crores. According to an investigation by CID, 797 white ration card-holders, each with a monthly income of less than Rs 5,000, bought land worth Rs 220 crore in Amaravati in 2014 and 2015.The state CID has now written to the Income Tax department and Enforcement Directorate asking for an investigation into possible tax evasion and money laundering in the deals. The letter, a copy of which is with TOI, states that the investigation found that many of the land buyers did not even have a PAN card and paid no income tax.After Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the then TDP government had announced that Amaravati would be the new capital of bifurcated AP and pooled 33,000 acres of land in the region next to Vijayawada . The YSRCP government that came to power in 2019, however, decided to have three separate capitals with Amaravati having only the assembly and all government offices would shift to Visakhapatnam.After detecting that white ration card holders were being shown as landowners, CID registered a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy. In the letter to the Andhra Pradesh income tax chief commissioner sent on Wednesday, CID officials stated, “…the investigating officer examined the registrations of suspicious land done during 2014 and 2015 in Amaravati capital area of AP. It came to the light that huge cash transactions took place in purchasing the lands.”The cops have given the I-T officials details of the purchasers, their address, size of land sold, sale deed and market value of the land. ED officials, on the other hand, have been asked to look into possible money laundering in the land deals.Almost all the 797 white ration card holders, who bought 761 acres in the Amaravati capital region, are residents of Guntur, the investigation has shown. Of these, 529 don't have PAN cards. The CID investigation found that the highest number of suspicious transactions took place in Thullur mandal where the core capital city of Amaravati was planned and the temporary secretariat and high court buildings have come up.CID has already registered a case against former ministers and senior leaders of Telugu Desam Party , Pattipati Pulla Rao and P Narayana, regarding the purchase of assigned land.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73539624,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-619891,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/capital-gains-poor-own-land-worth-rs-220-cr-in-amaravati/articleshow/73530828.cms

All the details should be sent immediately. They should also mention the dates by which the distribution was completed in each school,” read the order issued by Amrendra Singh, UP joint education director (basic).

The company from which the shoes, socks and bags were procured had given a 12-month guarantee on the items, under which defective items were promised to be replaced.

Illustration used for representational purpose

NASHIK: Despite district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal expressing reservations about Nashik Municipal Corporation’s ( NMC ) move to take over the city bus service , mayor Satish Kulkarni on Wednesday said the project would not be rolled back.

Kulkarni said that the NMC had decided to operate the city buses as part of its social obligation towards the city and not to make profits. He also reminded Bhujbal that the current bus service rendered by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) is in pathetic state due to which residents are depending on autorickshaws or personal vehicles for commuting, that is eventually increasing pollution in the city.

Sources in the civic administration said that rolling back the project could land the NMC into legal trouble as work order has been issued to the contractors to deploy buses by April this year. If the project is withdrawn at this juncture, the aggrieved contractors could drag the civic body to court.

“We have finalised three agencies to operate the city bus service. We have already signed agreements with two agencies and work orders have also been issues to these agencies to operate a total of 250 city buses,” an NMC official said.

“The third contractor will operate 150 electric buses. We are in the process of signing an agreement and work order will be given thereafter. Hence, we are much ahead now and can’t stop the city bus service project,” he added.

During a recent meeting with the mayor, Bhujbal had made it clear that he was not in favour of the city bus service project.

Bhujbal had said that that the financial condition of the civic body is not healthy and at this juncture if the NMC invests in projects like city bus service and Nashik Metro, it would add further pressure on NMC’s coffers.

A total of 400 city buses are to be deployed on various routes by the civic body through three agencies. The bus service is to be operated on GCC (gross cutting contract) for a period of 10 years. This includes purchase of new buses, maintenance of buses, employing drivers, purchasing fuel, etc. NMC will pay charges to private agencies on kilometer basis.

The municipal corporation has plans to run the Integrated Transport Management System (ITMS) through a private firm in an attempt to make the city bus service more effective.

We request you to take immediate measures to run the assembly without bias and partisan attitude,” the members pleaded.

Kolkata: All India Reserve Bank Employees’ Association ( AIRBEA ) has written to chief minister Mamata Banerjee to intervene against discrimination of Bengal by the RBI central management.

The association has argued that RBI has allotted only 11 posts for Kolkata office, the second largest office of RBI in the country for recruitment in the post of assistant against 419 for Mumbai. Total 926 posts were declared to be filled up across 19 offices of the country.

“Since this recruitment is state-centric, the recruitment meant for Kolkata office will be made from the unemployed youth of West Bengal only. Hence, it is clear that Kolkata, nay, West Bengal stands utterly discriminated by the central management of RBI. We have waged struggle against this deprivation of state,” said Samir Ghosh, general secretary of the organisation.

He said that this issue is important so far as federalism of the county and economic management of the state and a distinct prelude to not only outsourcing of significant jobs and functions of RBI but also centralization of remaining ones at its one office.

Nagpur: Even as the three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising chief justice of India Sharad Bobde on Wednesday refused to pass an interim stay on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), a group of citizens have initiated a letter-drive which they want the apex court to treat as a public interest litigation (PIL).

Mohammad Asjad, an imam at a Wanjara masjid, said they have been continuously posting the letter drafted by a SC lawyers’ association. “We got a common letter drafted by our legal friends. In our area, some of us are going door-to-door to hand over photocopies of the letter asking people to send them to the CJI,” he said.

Asjad said when some people show reluctance citing lack of time, they get the signature, name and mobile phone number to post the letters themselves. He claimed over 7000 letters have been sent so far from various parts of the city.

“Our constitution is in danger and it is our duty to protect it in whichever way possible. No harm should happen to what Babasaheb Ambedkar formulated years ago,” he said.

Abdul Basit, a resident of Jaffar Nagar, said over 5,000 letters have been dispatched by residents of his locality, Teka, Kamptee and other parts of Nagpur. The letter states that “CAA is unconstitutional and discriminates on religious lines”.

In several cases, Basit said he and other volunteers have borne the postal charges beside the Rs10 court stamp as many people were not ready to pay though they gave their signature and mobile numbers on the letters.

The lawyers’ association from supreme court wishes to help as the issue concerns every individual. Already, 144 petitions have been filed.

Raghav Chadha

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party has submitted to the Election Commission its list of star campaigners for the Delhi assembly elections . Led by party convener Arvind Kejrwial , it includes former Congress member and Matia Mahal MLA Shoaib Iqbal, who led the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act agitation in Jama Masjid and its neighbourhood, party councillor Abdul Rehman, who was named in an FIR lodged after the Seelampur anti-CAA violence and Amanatullah Khan, sitting MLA from Okhla.

The list of 39 star campaigners includes 12 sitting MLAs who make up 17 who are also contesting the assembly elections. Caste and popularity factors appear to have been kept in mind while finalising the list.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

Music director and singer Vishal Dadlani, composer of AAP’s election song Lage raho Kejriwal and AAP Lok Sabha member from Punjab Bhagwant Singh Maan have also been roped in to campaign for the party. While Maan is already on the task, Dadlani is expected to join the electioneering soon.

Senior functionary Pankaj Gupta, Preeti Sharma Menon, former Jamshedpur MP Ajoy Kumar and Prithvi Reddy are expected to put in more time as star campaigners because many others, mainly the sitting MLAs renominated for the contests, are likely to be busy with their own campaigns. All three RS members from AAP — Sanjay Singh, Sushil Gupta and ND Gupta — are also in the list. Among star campaigners who are also poll candidates are Saurabh Bharadwaj , Raghav Chadha , Sanjeev Jha , Rakhi Bidlan, Gopal Rai, Satyendar Jain, Rajendra Pal Gautam, Imran Hussain and Kailash Gahlot. Some AAP seniors from Punjab will also do their bit.

AAP is seeking a third chance at forming the government with its slogan of ‘Achhe beete panch saal, lage raho Kejriwal’ and has released a report card highlighting the party’s performance at Delhi’s helm. AAP has roped in political strategist Prashant Kishor’s consultancy firm, I-PAC, and is preparing an army of part-time volunteers for the campaigning. The party dropped 15 and fielded 46 of its 61 sitting MLAs. It has replaced some of its sitting MLAs with politicians who recently joined the party from other establishments, like Iqbal from Congress, and Ram Singh Netaji, who has been given the ticket for the Badarpur assembly constituency.

Mangaluru: When Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, scion of the Mysuru royal family, joined dignitaries at ugrana muhurtha in pouring foodgrains into a wooden storage box to mark the start of the 13-day Brahmakalashotsava rituals at Sri Durgaparameshwari Temple at Kateel near here on Wednesday, he revered a temple relic. This box, referred to as ‘ kalembi ,’ survived a devastating flood that threatened to destroy the temple town on July 28, 1944.

Narrating the tale of the ‘kalembi’ that is valued by the temple and its devotees, Harinaryana Asranna, hereditary priest, told TOI that the raging waters of the Nandini river almost threatened to destroy the temple on that fateful day in 1944. When the river was sweeping away everything in the temple, including this box and other boxes used by the temple’s Yakshagana troupes, it was my uncle Gopalkrishna Asranna who prayed to the deity to spare the town, he said.

When the waters rose, Gopalkrishna held on to the idol of the deity in the sanctum sanctorum tightly, and said a prayer that if the idol got washed away, he too would prefer to get washed away with it. It was then that a miracle happened, when a large boulder that was brought by the water, rested against the outer walls of the sanctorum, and forked the water away sparing the sanctorum and the idol of the deity from any damage, Harinarayana Asranna said.

The water that forked due to the boulder also created a whirlpool at the dhwajasthamba where this kalembi and other boxes got stuck, he said. Devotees used to pour their donation of foodgrains into this kalembi, and after these floods, the temple received foodgrains in ample measure, helping it start and sustain mass feeding of devotees, he said. This kalembi is stored in the folk-art exhibit museum at the nearby PU college, he said.

104,['23/01/2020'],Select panel to decide Andhra Pradesh capital Bill fate,"This story is from January 23, 2020

<p>N Chandrababu Naidu arrives in Mandadam village on Wednesday after council chairman sent the capital Bills ... Read More

AMARAVATI: In a major setback to the YS Jaganmohan Reddy government, Legislative Council chairman MA Shariff on Wednesday decided to refer the Bills on three capital cities and abolition of APCRDA to a select committee. This in effect means the state government cannot go ahead with its plan to create three capital cities for Andhra Pradesh pending submission of report by the select committee. The panel will have three months at its disposal to submit the report.

In a cliffhanger that left the entire treasury benches in a state of shock, the Council chairman declared that he had taken the decision with his discretionary powers.

The chairman’s decision is likely to delay the entire procedure related to the trifurcation of the capital city and abolishment of the capital region development authority. The panel will now go deep into the Bills and submit its report. Opposition TDP, which has a majority in the Council, scored over its bitter rival YSRC by insisting that the Bills be referred to select panel.

TDP, which had been confident of outsmarting the YSRC in the Council, ensured its strategy worked well. TDP supremo and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu stayed right in the Council gallery for over three hours to oversee the implementation of the strategy. Stumped by the chairman’s decision, ministers and YSRC legislators raised slogans and created ruckus in the Council.

Earlier in the day, the Council chairman adjourned the session several times to discuss the issue with both leaders of TDP and YSRCP. Although, TDP members were upset when Shariff announced that the notice on select committee issue was not technically moved before the Bills were taken up for discussion, they continued pressure on the chairman saying that technical issues should not be taken into consideration.

Opposition leader Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said the chairman had to accept the demand of the majority of the House. He insisted that the Bills should be sent to the select committee. He said the chairman could go for voting to find out the mood of the House in order to send the Bills to the select committee. He demanded that some of the ministers, who are not members of the House, should be sent out from the Council before taking up voting.

Finance minister Buggana Rajendranath contended that there was no need for Bills to be sent to the select committee. He said that the Council chairman had no authority to refer the Bills to the select committee as per the business rules. He said that the decentralization Bill was intended to take governance to the doorsteps of people and develop all regions. He said that zonal developmental boards would help accelerate the development in all the regions. “Chair had not accepted any notice regarding sending Bills to the select committee while taking up the Bills for discussion. There is no point in raising the issue in the middle,” argued Buggana.

Municipal administration minister Botsa Satyanarayana said that they have explained the rule position to the chairman on referring the Bills to the select committee. He said that Bills should not be referred to the select committee after taking up for discussion. TDP members contended that they had served the notice on sending the Bills to the select committee on Tuesday itself. Ramakrishnudu said that they had submitted the notice to the chairman before he agreed to take up the Bills for discussion. He insisted that the Bills should be sent to the select committee for the scrutiny.

Meanwhile, the government summoned advocate-general Sriram Subramanyam to the Council to explain the rule position to the chairman.

During the debate, BJP member Somu Veerraju lashed out at TDP for ruining the state with ‘irresponsible governance’. He said that Chandrababu Naidu had ditched the farmers of the capital city by showing graphic images. He welcomed the state government’s decision to relocate the High Court to Kurnool. He said that BJP was the first political party to raise the demand for setting up of High Court in Rayalaseema. He said BJP would support the state government’s plans to decentralize the developmental activities. Veerraju said that the government should do justice to the farmers, who voluntarily gave their lands for the capital city construction.

PDF legislators KS Lakshman Rao and Katti Narasimha Reddy wanted that the capital city to be retained in Amaravati.

The villagers said they will continue protests till the government withdraws its decision.

GUNTUR: The bandh called by Amaravati Joint Action Committee (JAC) to protest the shifting of the capital evoked mixed response in Guntur district on Wednesday.

Although the bandh was observed in the capital city villages, it had little impact in Guntur city. Police deployed additional forces at key junctions and warned of serious consequences if protestors tried to create trouble.

While several educational institutions declared holiday extending solidarity to the cause, a majority of the shops and establishments remained open and government offices and banks functioned as usual. Bus services plied without any disruption. Tension, however, prevailed for a while when TDP cadre clashed with the police during the bandh. A scuffle broke out when the police prevented TDP workers from stopping school buses. Reacting to it, a TDP worker pulled the shirt of inspector Sitharamaiah prompting the police to lathicharge. Meanwhile, a group of TDP cadre led by constituency in-charge Kovelamudi Ravindra (Nani) held a rally in Guntur West constituency demanding the continuance of Amaravati as the state capital. Nani appealed to all traders and merchants to extend their support by closing down shops. He said if only Amaravati continues as the capital then Guntur city would get additional funds for development. He said Amaravati was not only the capital city of the state but also the pride of Andhra Pradesh.

In another part of the city, police arrested TDP cadre led by party district unit president GVSSR Anjaneyulu and Mannava Subbarao.

Meanwhile, villagers in the capital city area criticised the police for taking local schools into their control to take shelter. The villagers said they will continue protests till the government withdraws its decision. They demanded that Jaganmohan Reddy should quit as chief minister for deceiving them.

TIRUPUR: The Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR&CE) department has issued a notice demanding Rs 450 crore as rental dues for the Kangeyam Combined Court Complex.

The notice, issued by Kangeyam HR&CE assistant commissioner Kannadasan , irked the judiciary, which shot back stating that the land housing the court complex does not belong to the department.

It all started when the court administration wrote a letter to the department, seeking 10 acres near the Sivanmalai Temple to construct residential quarters for judges. Replying to the letter, Kannadasan said in his correspondence dated October 9, 2019, that the request cannot be acceded since there were rental dues pending for the court complex land. “The land on which the Kangeyam court complex stands belongs to the department. But the judiciary has failed to pay rent for it” he said.

Shocked over the claim, the principal district judge S Alli sought a detailed explanation. Kannadasan wrote back stating that Rs 450 crore was pending as rental due between July 14, 2012 and December 31, 2019.

The judge summoned land documents and held an inquiry with revenue and HR&CE officials and said Kannadasan was wrong.

Inquiries revealed that the .020 hectare land housing the court complex was owned by C Kumarappa Gounder and Thulasi Naicker till 1932, when the government acquired it. In 1999, a government order was passed allotting the land to the judicial and agriculture department. Subsequently, the land was given to the district sessions court.

When contacted, Kannadasan stood his ground and said that he was right in issuing the notice. But he said he does not have enough records to prove that the land belongs to the HR&CE department.

Meanwhile, senior HR&CE officials expressed embarrassment over the incident. “I don’t know why Kannadasan wrote such a letter without having any records. The department will conduct an inquiry into the issue,” a senior officer told TOI.

The PhD aspirant came down after six hours

Bhopal: A high voltage drama continued for six hours at Barkatullah University on Wednesday as a Ph.D aspirant climbed on top of water tank to stage his protest. He alleged that an ineligible candidate was given permission to pursue research, while he was not considered. In 2016 too, some students of the university had done the same act to voice their demands.

Ph.D candidate Pankaj Bhargava climbed the water tank on the university campus at 10 am. He said, ""I have been writing and discussing the issue with higher authorities of the university for the last one and a half months about the ongoing fraud in Ph.D admissions, but no action was taken by the university administration. Eventually I had to resort to this act to raise my voice.”

He added, ""I has appeared in the Ph.D entrance test last year in physical education. My name was on the first place in the wait-list. After a few candidates did not turn up, BU should have given me the opportunity. Instead, BU gave permission to pursue Ph.D to a person, who did not submit the ‘no objection certificate,” said Bhargava.

He further said, ""My demand is that BU should release the wait-list at the earliest."" Bhargava climbed down from water tank around 4 pm after the vice chancellor issued a written order assuring the candidate that wait-list of the subject would be issued soon. Members of municipal corporation, SDRF and police personnel were present when the incident happened.

Registrar B Bharti issued the order to form a three-member high-level committee to look into the fraud allegations made by Bhargava. He also directed the departments to issue the wait-list immediately. All the Ph.D candidates serving in government and non-government departments have been asked to obtain a ‘no objection certificate’ which is mandatory. Bharti said, ""We are looking into the allegations levelled by Bhargava. However, no one is allowed to disturb the academics of the university by such acts. We will do our work as per the rules and regulations. His name was not on the merit list; and figuring on the wait-list does not make anyone eligible for Ph.D. If his claim is correct, justice would be done in the case. Else, legal action would be taken against him.""

111,['23/01/2020'],Nashik corporators fume over defunct streetlights,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Representational Image



NASHIK: Local corpoators of the Trimbak Road area have expressed their anguish about the defunct streetlights along the Trimbak road in Satpur division of the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ).

The corporators said that the streetlights were not repaired even after reporting the issue to the electricity department of the municipal corporation.

Responding to the corporators, civic officials said that they were unable to carry out the repair work of streetlights due to lack of hydraulic vehicle lifts.

The mayor has also directed the officials to look into the issue and ensure that the defunct streetlights are repaired at the earliest.

“There are a number of streetlights along the Trimbak road. Lakhs of warkaris go to Trimbakeshwar in January to seek blessings of Saint Nivruttinath Maharaj and pass through the Timbak road. Therefore, I had approached the electric department of the NMC, urging them to repair defunct streetlights in the area, but in vain,” said corporator Seema Nigol.

“I had approached the officials from electric department several times; however, they did not take cognizance of the issue. They should be serious about the problem in view of the dindi of Nivruttinath Maharaj to Trimbakeshwar,” added Nigol.

Besides nigol, corporator Salim Shaikh, too, complained about the defunct streetlights in the area.

“Most streetlights in the Satpur area of the city are defunct. Moreover, there are many areas where there is a dire need of streetlights. Some electric poles have been damaged. The civic administration needs to conduct a survey in this regard and ensure that there are no defunct streetlights in any part of the city,” said Shaikh.

Vilas Shinde, Dinkar Patil, and other corporators also reiterated the same.

“We have already provided a vehicle for each ward, but the electric poles are taller in the Trimbak road area and we have only one vehicle to carry out maintenance work up to that height. Also, the vehicle was not available at the time due to which the work got delayed. But, the defunct streetlights will be repaired shortly,” an official from electric department of the municipal corporation said.

112,['23/01/2020'],HC refuses to hear PIL against CAA,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Nagpur: Refusing to hear petition challenging Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday granted liberty to the petitioner to approach Supreme Court which is hearing over 100 petitions on the same issue.

The public interest litigation (PIL) was listed before a division bench comprising Justice Ravi Deshpande and Justice Amit Borkar.

“Assistant solicitor general and additional government pleader have brought to our notice that about 100 petitions have been filed before the apex court challenging the validity of the CAA, which is the subject matter of the challenge in the present writ. All such matters are being heard by the apex court. In view of this, on the ground of propriety, we refuse to entertain this PIL,” the bench said.

Petitioner Urmila Kowe from Bhandara had filed the PIL through counsel Ashwin Ingole stating that she was espousing the cause of the citizens of India, who are not in a position to arrange for the necessary documents in support of their citizenship.

According to her, the CAA is a colourable legislation that violated the secular nature of the Constitution. “It’s discriminatory and violates the basic structure of the Constitution of India,” said Kowe.

She further contended that CAA is class legislation harping on religious identity of an individual. It also contravened the principles of secularism which have been recognized by the apex court in many cases. “The controversial amendment to the Citizenship Act manifestly and arbitrarily violates the fundamental rights enshrined in the statute,” she said.

Kowe argued that the amendment covered only a class of minorities from specific countries sharing borders with India from where there has been trans-border migration and it overlooked other reportedly persecuted religious minorities.

“The legislation also doesn’t cover ethnic and linguistic issues of Tamils of Sri Lanka and that the Act is in contravention of India’s international obligations under Article 14 and 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which the country is a signatory,” she said.

(With inputs from Sakina Dawood)

What HC said:

* About 100 petitions filed before SC challenging CAA

* Same is subject matter of challenge in PIL filed by petitioner

* All such matters are being heard by apex court currently

* Refuse to entertain this PIL on ground of propriety

* Petitioner at liberty to approach SC

Thanjavur: Tension prevailed at the Kumbakonam panchayat union council office here on Wednesday after a clash broke out between the elected local body members of the DMK and AIADMK when the council met for the first time. The incident began when the AIADMK members objected to a resolution adopted by the DMK members thanking DMK president M K Stalin for the victory in the local body elections.

For the first meeting of the panchayat union council, 18 DMK members including vice-chairman of panchayat union council T Ganesan, seven AIADMK members and two independent members were present.

The meeting was chaired by council chairman Gayathri. Commissioner Poonguzhali also attended the meeting.

A few resolutions were read out at the meeting, which were passed by Poonguzhali. However, the AIADMK members raised questions about the resolutions leading to a commotion. On hearing the noise, supporters of both parties tried to barge into the meeting hall. However, office-bearers and police prevented them from entering the hall. Both party cadres raised slogans slamming each other.

In the ruckus the glass panels of Poonghuzhali's cabin were broken. Following this, a large posse of police was deployed there. The DMK members demanded action against those who broke the glass panels.

On information, Kumbakonam DSP rushed to the spot and held talks with both party members and cadres. Poonguzhali lodged a complaint with the Nachiarkoil police demanding action against those who damaged the glass panels.

Mayiladuthurai DMK MP S Ramalingam, Kumbakonam DMK MLA Sakottai G Anbalagan and district panchayat council vice-chairman K Muthuselvan participated in the meet as special invitees.

114,['23/01/2020'],New excise policy will uncork 500 liquor subshops in Madhya Pradesh,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Representative image

BHOPAL: The new excise policy of the Congress government for 2019-20, finalized on January 6, will lead to the opening of 500 liquor subshops in Madhya Pradesh .

A liquor subshop is a sales counter that can be opened by a liquor licence holder if the distance between two regular shops is 5km or more in urban areas and 10km or more in rural areas.

There are around 3,600 liquor shops in the state, with the state expecting a revenue of Rs 13,000 crore this fiscal. Going by the collections so far, it’s unlikely to meet the target and may fall short by Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 crore, say sources.

As per initial estimates of the excise department, if 500 subshops are opened, it could yield an additional revenue of around Rs 2,000 crore. Liquor contractors don’t have to wait till the next fiscal to open subshops, but it is unlikely anyone would be willing to do so in the two months left. It may not be financially viable for them this fiscal to recover the subshop licence fee.

For a regular liquor shop valued/auctioned at Rs 2 crore per year, a licence holder needs to pay an additional 15% to open a subshop — or Rs 30 lakh. For liquor shops valued between Rs 2 crore and Rs 5 core, a subshop will cost 15% for the first Rs 2 crore and 10% of the remaining amount. Those owning liquor shops valued at over Rs 5 crore will need to pay the government 15% for the first Rs 2 crore, 10% for the next Rs 3 crore, and 5% of what’s left.

MP excise commissioner Rajesh Bahuguna explained that a liquor subshop must not be misinterpreted as a new liquor shop. “It is just extension of sale counter between two liquor shops in a prescribed gap. How many subshops will be opened depends on how many liquor contractors want to do so. We have an initial estimate, but things will get clear once new liquor shop licences are allotted,” he said. Opening a subshop is not mandatory for a liquor contractor, officials say.

Permission to open subshops has kicked up a political tussle between opposition BJP and ruling Congress. BJP has claimed that the new policy will turn the state into ‘Madira Pradesh’ while Congress justifies the new rule by saying it will prevent adulteration of liquor. Congress has asked BJP why it couldn’t ban liquor in MP in its 15-year rule and why over 890 liquor shops opened in Shivraj Singh Chouhan ’s tenure as CM.

115,['23/01/2020'],Land woes: Kateel temple may adopt ‘bhudhana’ model,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Mangaluru: The 13-day Brahmakalashotsava rituals of Goddess Durgaparameshwari that got under way at Sri Kshetra Kateel on Wednesday will be showcased as a model to the other temples in the state, said Nalin Kumar Kateel , president, Brahmakalashotsava Committee. When the rituals were held in 2007, the committee had taken up a few initiatives that have materialised in the intervening 12 years, and the same will be emulated during this year’s rituals, he said.

Addressing the media at Kateel, Nalin Kumar said a major initiative planned for this Brahmakalashotsava is to create a land bank for the temple. “We are seriously handicapped by a shortage of land to take up various development works for this ‘A’ grade endowment temple. We are striving to overcome this with donors purchasing parcels of land abutting the temple from owners, and donate it to the temple,” he said.

Under this ‘ bhudhana ’ (land donation) concept, a donor will pay around Rs1 lakh per cent of land to the owner, and this will be entrusted to the temple. The temple management committee on its part had also purchased land from landowners to facilitate widening of the ratha beedhi in front of the temple and reduce congestion there. The long winding legal battle to clear shops on either side of the temple’s main entrance too has borne fruit, he said.

While most such shopowners have voluntarily given up their rights to the shops, others had engaged the temple in a protracted legal battle, Nalin said, adding the remaining shops too will be cleared once the Brahmakalashotsava rituals are over. This was one of the reasons why some of the development works planned in the run up to this mega religious ritual held once every 12 years as per agama shastra were delayed and are still going on, Nalin noted.

The temple authorities also demolished the Saraswati Mandir in front of the temple that it owned, to make way for a makeshift ‘ugrana’ or kitchen store, the MP said. Underscoring the need for this initiative, Nalin said the guests and families that poured into the temple town on days considered auspicious for marriage, was such that it outscored the devotees that would come to the temple for the annual temple festivals where the rush is unmanageable.

On the infrastructure side, Nalin said widening of roads leading to the temple town has facilitated devotees to reach it with ease. The roads widened include the road from Ullanje to Kinnigoli and Arasulepadavu to Devaragudde that leads to Nellitheertha. The road from Moorukaveri to Permude has been widened at a cost of Rs 10 crore and a 3.5km long bypass road abutting the temple town was constructed to avoid the narrow road in front of the temple, Nalin added.

119,['23/01/2020'],Rs825cr fake purchases used to claim Rs148cr GST input credit,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Nagpur: An investigation conducted by the Directorate General of GST Intelligence’s (DGGSTI) Nagpur zonal unit has uncovered rampant practice of availing fraudulent input tax credit (ITC), by issuing fake e-way bills. This is in line with similar cases found in other states too.

A search conducted into the accounts of 58 business firms showed that fake purchases worth Rs825 crore were recorded to claim ITC to the tune of Rs148 crore. It was found that 10,000 fake invoices were issued to avail the ITC. The tax sleuths have arrested four persons in the case. Some of the accused are absconding, said a press release issued by the DGGSTI. The sleuths conducted searches at 75 places in this case.

ITC is a crucial component in an indirect tax system like GST. This is a proportionate reduction available in the tax liability for the levy that has been paid at the time of purchase of inputs. For example, the tax paid at the time of buying raw material is deducted while calculating GST on the final product. This is done to prevent cascading effect of tax.

The tax sleuths scrutinized each of the e-way bills to detect the fraud. It was found that the vehicle numbers mentioned in the e-way bills were merely two or three-wheelers in many of the cases. An e-way bill is proof of transport of goods from the seller to buyer’s end. The transaction cannot be validated without an e-way bill.

In order to record fake purchases in the returns and claim ITC, fake e-way bills were issued. There was no transit of goods but to validate the claim fake invoices had to be generated, said the source. The vehicle numbers were of automobiles that were not meant for commercial transport. The registration numbers of random vehicles were quoted in the e-way bills, said a source. In a large number of cases the vehicles did not even exist, the source said.

This is part of a quarterly investigation carried out by the DGGSTI. The figures are expected to further increase as the probe proceeds further.

Bhopal: Three cities from MP -- Bhopal, Sagar and Indore -- have been recognised by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for smart city development. Sagar topped in its category for overall performance, while Indore and Bhopal were recognised for specific projects. Bhopal smart city development too has been recognised.

Sagar smart city development was selected in the third stack of 30 cities for smart city development in 2017.

The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) has started giving awards for India Smart Cities -- under the Smart Cities Mission -- to felicitate and recognise their efforts under different categories. The awards ceremony will be held on Friday.

All smart cities have incorporated smart measures in the area-based development (ABD) and pan-city development.

“We have worked on all smart city development parameters and Sagar has been ranked as top performing city in the group,” said Sagar smart city CEO, Rahul Singh Rajpoot. The lake front development, pegged at Rs 92 crore along with an integrated control and command centre (ICCC) going live since October worked in favour of Sagar smart city.

Out of 33 applications, Sagar was selected in the last set of eight cities. Amravati and Rajkot stood second and third respectively.

Indore was recognised for riverfront development as a key initiative of the city in ABD area. Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has started riverfront development work of Kahn river under the smart city project.

The Mission was introduced in the form of a competition, called the smart city challenge. The first stage was in July 2015 when 20 cities, including Bhopal and Indore, were selected. Bhopal has been ranked in seventh position. It's public cycle sharing project was recognised by the Union ministry under smart cities mission.

These cities were required to develop their smart city plans (SCPs) and compete against each other. The SCPs were evaluated on the basis of the solutions, the processes followed, the feasibility and cost effectiveness of the plans, and citizen engagement.

Over the last four years, the ministry has announced winner cities in batches. So far, 99 cities have been selected under the Mission. MP has seven smart cities.

123,['23/01/2020'],State hires Rohatgi to defend bills,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Vijayawada: The state government, which has initiated several austerity measures and listed empty coffers as one of the reasons for shifting the capital to Visakhapatnam from Amaravati, on Wednesday earmarked a budget of Rs 5 crore to hire senior counsel and former attorney-general Mukul Rohatgi to argue in high court on behalf of the government on the petitions challenging the Bills.

The planning department issued a GO on Wednesday allocating Rs 5 crore to hire Rohatgi. It has sanctioned Rs 1 crore as advance payment to the senior counsel. The GO stated that the services of Rohatgi have been hired based on the recommendation of the advocate-general.

Rohatgi, an expert in constitutional matters, was incidentally one of the counsels, who had argued on behalf of chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy in disproportionate assets case. On the other hand, senior counsel Ashok Bhan, who represented the CBI in Jagan’s disproportionate assets case, is now arguing on behalf of the capital city farmers. The farmers, who had given land for Amaravati, moved the high court challenging the capital shift bills passed in the state assembly.

Allahabad high court

ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court on Wednesday sought information from the state government about the alleged misappropriation of funds by Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan in the name of Mohammad Ali Jauhar University in Rampur.

Hearing a PIL petition filed by Faisal Khan seeking a CBI probe into the matter, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Samit Gopal fixed January 29 as the next date of hearing.

The petitioner claimed that university’s property amounting to Rs 80 crore was being used by Khan for private purposes.

He also requested the court to direct a CBI investigation into the matter and ensure recovery of the amount misappropriated by Khan.

When the court asked about the need to entertain the PIL when several FIRs had already been filed regarding misappropriation of funds, the petitioner’s counsel argued that assessment and recovery of funds could not be done in criminal proceedings initiated through FIR and as per reports of district administration, the matter should be probed by higher authorities.

Despite the presence of police, shops along the plaza display their products, encroaching up to four feet of p... Read More

CHENNAI: Oxidised jhumkas and antique-style neckpieces were neatly displayed on a roller stand by a hawker from UP. He had placed knick-knacks such as key chains and embroidered handkerchiefs on a green canvas spread on the newly built sidewalk of the pedestrian plaza in Pondy Bazaar . His neighbour, from Chennai, sold stringed jasmines from a large basket. Nearby, another man sold dholaks.

There are at least a dozen hawkers on either sides of the plaza. And it’s not just hawkers who are encroaching the platforms of the 800m-long stretch built at a cost of Rs 40 crore as part of the smart city project. Many shop owners had either rented out spaces in front of the shops or extended their own shops on the platform by up to four feet.

“Unless we put things on display we won’t be able to attract customers,” said a senior staff of a fashion jewellery store. Clothes, hand-made bags, upholstery and many other products were placed on tables and shelves outside the store.

But this was not the plan when hundreds of vendors from the platform on either sides of the road between Thanikachalam Road signal and Pondy Bazaar police station were moved to a shopping complex, the road was shrunk and traffic was made one-way to let people shop in peace. Greater Chennai Corporation had said the space on the platform would be used for music shows, street plays and public awareness campaigns.

“That idea can fade away soon,” said Radhika K, a techie who lives in Ashok Nagar. “I come for a walk here at least twice every week. I see that the pavements are now being slowly encroached upon even when there are policemen around.”

The colourful cement slabs that have been placed for people to sit have been etched with names, initials and love messages. “I chased away at least two young men who were writing on the slabs with pocket knives,” said a constable, who was posted on duty. “We have sought permission from our seniors to book them for defacing public places. If we don’t nip this now we won’t be able to maintain its beauty,” she said.

A little further down, beneath a tree, there were empty alcohol bottles and food packets. “Walking towards the stretch is also painful,” said 65-year-old E Shanmugapandian, a retired banker. “The newly built platform on the other side of the Thanikachalam Road signal is used for parking bikes and autos. Some of the riders honk on the platform asking pedestrians to move,” he said. “The plaza was a paradise to many people like me. I hope it’s not lost soon,” he said.

127,['23/01/2020'],Activists: Enact legislation to guarantee essential services,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Puducherry: It is high time the Puducherry government enacts the Right to public services act to guarantee time-bound delivery of public services to the citizens , opine a cross-section of civil rights’ activists in the Union territory of Puducherry.

The act will not only ensure quick delivery of essential services but also establish a mechanism to punish the errant government servants in case of delay or default in extending the essential services, they pointed out. “Enacting the Right to public services act by the Puducherry government appears to be of paramount significance. This legislation is in place in many states and Union Territories in India with Madhya Pradesh being the first to enact in 2010 followed by Bihar in 2011. The right to receive public services is the power conferred on the people to obtain the services from the government departments within the stipulated time. This right also empowers the common man to initiate further action including claiming of compensation from the designated officers in case of delay or default,” said former Lok Sabha MP and economist M Ramadass.

The Puducherry government must first evolve a list of public services that will come under the legislation and notify them in the government gazette before enacting the act to guarantee the delivery of such services within a stipulated time limit. Most of the states and Union territories have included the common public services such as issuing birth, death, marriage and nativity certificates, ration cards, voters’ identity cards and extending power connections among others.

Karnataka has included 151 services from 11 departments under the act while Rajasthan 124 services from 15 departments, Delhi 50 services from 18 departments and Jammu and Kashmir 45 services from six departments. The Puducherry government must establish a nodal department to monitor, control and coordinate the public service delivery mechanism in the administration. The government must appoint a designated officer in every department to implement the act.

An aggrieved citizen can lodge a complaint with the designated officers against the government servants if they fail to deliver the services within the stipulated time. The citizens can also appeal against the orders of the designated officers. “The act must clearly mention the time limit within which the services will be delivered. Normally, the prescribed time limit is 30 days. In case of difficulty in providing the service within the prescribed time limit, the designated officer should inform the applicant in writing the reason for not providing the service. The act should also specify the minimum and maximum amount of compensation that the applicant is entitled in case the officers fail to receive the service,” said Ramadass.

People’s Pulse president P Devanathan said the Puducherry government commenced the process of introducing the act as early as in 2013 but failed to show any urgency in enacting the much-needed act.

“When we approached the then chief secretary in 2013 urging him to initiate efforts to prevent corrupt practices in the government departments, he told us the administration has commenced the process of introducing the Right to public services act. But even after six years, the government has not made any progress,” said Devanathan.

128,['23/01/2020'],Help Mysuru bag five-star status in garbage-free cities category again: Mayor,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Mysuru: Mayor Tasneem Bano has appealed to the residents to help Mysuru bag five-star status in garbage-free cities category again by cooperating with MCC.

Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, she said that Mysuru had emerged as the third cleanest city in the country under ‘Swachh Survekshan-2019 and had also bagged five stars among the garbage-free cities category.

The city had won the Cleanest City tag twice in 2015 and 2016, but slipped to the eighth spot in 2017 and 2018.

The Swachh Survekshan 2020 had just completed two days ago in city. The central team, which had visited the city, surveyed the places on their own yardsticks and left the city two days back.

However, a team of experts from Swachh Bharath Mission-Urban to study the city in garbage-free cities category for star rating initiative will be arriving in Mysuru in the next one or three days.

They will be rating cities on a 7-star rating system based on multiple cleanliness indicators for solid waste management, which will include door-to-door collection, bulk generator compliance, source segregation, sweeping, scientific processing of waste, scientific land filling, plastic waste management, construction and demolition management, dump remediation & citizen grievance redressal system etc, construction of toilets to achieve the Swachh Bharat Mission of ‘Open Defecation Free and Garbage Free India.’

“The MCC is totally unaware of their inspection, when and where they would visit suddenly. They will collect all information they wanted from the residents regarding segregation of dry and wet waste separately and handing over the same to pourakarmikas, garbage collection trucks and vehicles regularly. Residents must focus on keeping the city clean, besides not to throw wastes, dump in drainages and vacant plots,” she added.

Thanking her party leaders and residents of Mysuru for electing her as mayor, Tasneem Bano promised to give utmost importance to keep all roads and layouts in all 65 wards of corporation clean throughout the year. The city will be kept cleanest and beautiful during her tenure, she said.

She also added that she had given lot of attention to fill potholes on the roads and to repair the drainages damaged for laying underground cables.

“I have also given instructions to officials to stop giving permission to lay underground cables as individuals involved in such activities are damaging the drainages and roads”, she said.

Tasneem also said that she had given clear-cut instructions to the officials in all zones to pay surprise visit in all wards including slaughterhouses, meat shops, city outskirts apart from Central Business district areas and arterial roads to check cleanliness. “Directions have been given to them to penalize the residents and shopkeepers on the spot for not keeping city clean,” she said.

129,['23/01/2020'],"MVA clears Rs 2,413cr Nag River project, will also call shots","This story is from January 23, 2020

Nagpur: In what appears to be a move to take control of the BJP-ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and its projects, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Wednesday approved the revised cost of the ambitious Nag River Pollution Abatement Project. Now, Pili River too finds a mention in the project name.

The cabinet also constituted a high-profile committee of ministers to execute and monitor the project. While three district Congress MLAs are part of the committee, none of the city’s four BJP MLAs find a place in it.

The name of the project was modified following the recommendation of guardian minister Nitin Raut who, along with home minister Anil Deshmukh and, sports and youth welfare minister Sunil Kedar form the committee.

Environment minister Aditya Thackeray too is a member. The municipal commissioner is the member secretary.

The cabinet approved the state share of 25% in the total revised project cost of Rs 2,412.64 crore. “Union Jalshakti Mantralaya and National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD) had approved the project to mitigate pollution of Nag River. The NMC will implement the project. Centre, state and NMC will bear share of 60%, 25% and 15%, respectively,” reads the cabinet note.

The centre’s share will be Rs 1,447.59 crore, state will contribute Rs 603.16 crore and NMC Rs 361.89 crore. “The Centre will raise a loan of Rs 1,864.30 crore from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). State’s repayment of Rs 403.90 crore will come from the JICA loan and will have to pay the balance of Rs 199.26 crore. Cabinet has assured to repay the loan as well as its remaining share to Jalshakti Mantralaya,” the cabinet note added.

The decision to “constitute a coordination committee under Nagpur guardian minister Nitin Raut for execution and monitoring the project”, too has been approved by the cabinet.

In 2010, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court had treated media reports of high-level pollution in Nag River polluting Kanhan and Wainganga rivers, and Gosikhurd project as a suo motu PIL and directed the civic body to rejuvenate the city’s iconic river-turned nullah.

The NMC, which then too had a BJP majority, proposed the project in 2011. The project got momentum when Devendra Fadnavis became chief minister and Nitin Gadkari got elected as MP in 2014. The state and Centre cleared the project in 2015.

Gadkari, Fadnavis and BJP city president Pravin Datke have been trying to execute the project. Last year, the NMC realized that the project cost had gone up. In November last year, the Centre approved the revised cost and sent it to state for its nod.

Raut told TOI that Wednesday was historic day. “The name of the project has been changed to Nag and Pili River Pollution Abatement Project. Pili river was part of the project but its name was not highlighted. The approval was pending with the government. I got a cabinet approval in the larger interest of the city,” he said.

A good stretch of Pili river falls under Raut’s North Nagpur constituency.

Raut said BJP MLAs and NMC office bearers have no role to play in the project hence “they are not in committee”.

Next, an agreement will be executed between Centre, state and JICA following which the loan amount will be received in instalments. NMC will then float tenders and execute the project.

NEW DELHI: The Republic Day is just four days away, and various states, Union territories and central agencies are busy giving final touches to their tableaux for the morning parade on Rajpath. One of them is Kolkata Port Trust , the oldest operating port in the country celebrating its 150th year. For the first time, the port, which comes under the Union shipping ministry, will present its own tableau.

This year, 16 states and Union territories, and six central ministries will take part in the parade. The contingent will be led by the Chhattisgarh tableau highlighting its traditional crafts and ornaments. It will have an idol of Nandi — the mount of Lord Shiva — made out of bell metal at the front, while tribal folk artistes will perform Gaur dance, a traditional art form of the Maria tribe, on both sides.

Punjab’s tableau is dedicated to the humane principles preached by Guru Nanak as it’s the 550th birth anniversary of the founder of the Sikh religion. Odisha will showcase the famous Rukuna Rath Yatra of Lord Lingaraja, worshipped as both Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Meghalaya’s tableau will focus on the double-decker living root bridge, one of its main tourist attractions, while Jammu and Kashmir will showcase the new Union territory’s ‘Back to Village’ programme, launched last year to empower villages and panchayats.

Gujarat will bring Rani ki Vav: Jal Mandir (queen’s stepwell), an ancient engineering marvel that features on Unesco’s World Heritage Site list. Its preparation is being supervised by Pankaj Modi , younger brother of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . A deputy director in the information department of Gujarat government, he said, “Rani ki Vav is the best example of Gujarat’s traditional means for water conservation that exhibits a unique combination of civilisation, culture and art along with an engineering marvel.”

Besides Meghalaya, Assam will be the other northeastern state to be present in the parade. Its tableau will display the state’s unique craftsmanship and culture through bamboo and cane crafts. Bhortal Nritya, a popular traditional dance form practised in the state, will also be displayed.

The glory of the heritage buildings and sites of Jaipur will be the theme of the Rajasthan tableau, which will be decorated with jaali jharokha to display the city’s magnetic beauty through markets, monuments and grand gateways.

The commerce ministry’s promotion of industry and internal trade department will present ‘Startups: Reach for the Sky’, which will showcase the life cycle of a startup and the all-round support provided by the central government in this journey. It will depict how ideas come to life and positively impact the lives of common people.

Allahabad: The ongoing protest at Roshan Bagh locality continued on Wednesday. The protestors decided to continue stir for four more weeks.

The Supreme Court, on Wednesday refused to put on hold the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and has given the Centre four weeks to respond to petitions on the law, making it clear that it would not grant any stay without hearing the government.

“We have decided that now that the Apex court has given Four week’s of time to the government to submit its reply on the CAA, we will continue with our dharna for the same length of period”, said Adil Hamza, member of Samajwadi Party (SP) who is leading the protest from the first day. Hamza was among the leading protestors against CAA and NRC since the day parliament passed the bill in December.

Amaravati: Clearing the decks for a probe into alleged insider trading in the capital city area, the state assembly passed a resolution on Wednesday.

Home minister Mekathoti Sucharitha moved a resolution to take up the investigation in the assembly. The cabinet had recently decided to handover the investigation to the Lokayukta. Following the speaker’s directive to go deep into the insider trading issue, chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy assured that they would follow the speaker’s advice.

Subsequently, the state government moved a resolution to take the House into confidence. Speaking on the resolution, Sucharitha said the initial inquiries revealed that the TDP functionaries had purchased over 4,000 acres in the capital city area just before the official announcement on the capital city was made by the previous TDP regime. The minister said that TDP functionaries got information from government sources and invested heavily in the capital city area.

Civil supplies minister Kodali Nani said TDP legislators from north-coastal districts were doing grave injustice to their region as they had eyed the packages offered by party president Chandrababu Naidu.

Government whip Kapu Ramachandra Reddy said that Naidu had always indulged in corrupt practices during his long political career. He said that Naidu’s encouragement had only helped its functionaries to bet on Amaravati. Tanuku legislator Karumuri Nageswara Rao said that TDP leaders wanted to make billions by duping farmers.

Sources said that the state government is most likely to constitute a special investigation team (SIT) to assist the Lokayukta.

134,['23/01/2020'],BSNL to rollout 4G services in M’luru city today,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Mangaluru: While the state’s capital Bengaluru is still on 3G, tier-II city Mangaluru will join four others districts in the state with 4G services from Thursday. The network switch over will happen at 8.30am when MP Nalin Kumar Kateel launches the service.

The service is being launched after a delay of five months. The first announcement was made in August last year. With this, Manglauru will become the fifth city in the state after Kalaburagi , Bidar , Raichur and Vijayapura to get this facility.

Sources in Dakshina Kannada telecom district’s BSNL said 4G services are being rolled in tier-II cities as BSNL wants to test the service in a smaller population before launching it in Bengaluru. Their services in four other cities have been successful, which made the launch possible in Mangaluru.

In Vijayapura, the services were launched almost a year ago. A person using BSNL services said the speeds were good and the network performance was satisfactory, unlike 3G services, where speeds were pathetic. BSNL Dakshina Kannada telecom district sources said that the speeds would be in the range of 8mbps to 10mbps in areas where 3G services were offering speeds below 12kbps, especially in a busy location like MG Road.

The service is already up and running in 13 towers from Ucchila in Udupi district to Mukka near Surathkal , about 24km from here. Sources said that 151 towers in the Mangaluru area have already been converted to 4G technology, and BSNL has already reformed the 2,100MHz spectrum band, used for 3G, to strengthen its 4G network. The telecom operator is deploying L900 technology in the 2,100MHz band to complement its 4G services.

When activated, 4G services would be seamlessly available from Uchila till Nethravathi bridge in Mangaluru, a distance of about 50km, and till Farangipete on the Mangaluru-Bengaluru National Highway. Beyond 4G connectivity, the services would automatically switch over to 3G services when the customers move out of the 4G range. The district rollout is expected by April 2020.

As on January 21, the 3G sim conversion to 4G was at 37% in Mangaluru and 42% in the Uchila to Mukka area.

Chennai: Shocked over the submission of Chennai Corporation that it has planned to provide steel carts to licensed vendors in Marina at a monthly rent of Rs 100, Madras high court said authorities must exhibit some sense in fixing such rents and made it clear that the carts should not be rented out for anything less than Rs 5,000 a month.

A division bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice R Suresh Kumar also expressed their disappointment on Chennai Corporation’s proposal to increase the number of licensed vendors to trade in Marina from 900 to 1,352. The issue pertains to regulating vending in Marina and relocating fishermen from the Loop Road to a proposed exclusive fish market in Nochi Kuppam.

As to the corporation’s proposal to increase the number of licensed vendors from 900 to 1,352, the bench said, “The corporation of Chennai appears to have taken a decision to raise the number of shopping carts permitted in Marina beach from 900 to 1352. This court had already expressed that even 900 is much higher. If more number of carts are allowed, it would lead to congestion in the beach, the court added.

Directing the corporation to file a revised proposal for fixing monthly rent for the carts, the bench adjourned the hearing to January 29.

When the plea came up for hearing on Wednesday, additional advocate-general S R Rajagopal submitted that eviction of fishermen from Loop Road could be completed once the proposed market is established. As to constructing a footpath along the beach side of the road, the corporation is awaiting clearance from the Tamil Nadu State Coastal Zone Management Authority (TNSCZMA), he added.

Counsel for TNSCZMA submitted that the proposal has been forwarded to its Delhi office since guidelines framed by the National Green Tribunal prohibits any development in the sea side of the road.

However, expressing its dismay over refusal to grant clearance for the proposed footpath, the bench directed the M Jayanthi, member-secretary of TNSCZMA to appear before the court on January 29.

AAI is planning to shift international arrivals to a new terminal by year-end and rebuild the existing arrival... Read More

CHENNAI: Airports Authority of India (AAI) has begun vacating portions of the international arrival building so that it can be demolished in phases for rebuilding. Work to reconstruct the arrival building is likely to begin by the year-end after the integrated terminal coming up between the passenger terminals is built.

An AAI official said baggage conveyors have been moved closer to one another to free up space that has been cordoned off for pulling down. The terminal has six conveyors. More changes will be made so that more areas can be freed up in the coming months, he said.

A remote bus lounge in the terminal used by airline passengers to alight from shuttle buses will be taken up for work in the future. “The idea is to give as much space as possible for construction so that the rebuilding is quickly done. The existing arrival hall will be pulled down and rebuilt so that it can be merged with the new terminal that is coming up. This will help the airport to handle more international passengers after two to three years,” the official said.

Areas that have been cordoned off will be prepared for demolition soon. Since the building is marked for pulling down after shifting of operations, only required maintenance work is being done.

As per the plan, AAI will complete the integrated terminal, move international arrivals from the existing building to the new structure, pull down and rebuild existing arrival terminal as part of the phase 2 expansion to augment passenger capacity to 30 million a year. The new terminal will have capacity to handle domestic and international passengers.

Since international passenger movement has seen an increase in the past few years and AAI was not able to commission the ground floor arrival hall of international terminal because of lack of personnel and adequate baggage handling facility, focus is being given to add space for international terminal under phase 2 of expansion work.

Vijayawada: Even as CBSE announced its decision to allow children suffering from dyscalculia to use calculators for exams, the initiative may only aid a fraction of the students in AP.

According to CBSE officials, only around 10,000 students from the board’s affiliated schools have been identified as having the disability. Dyscalculia is a learning disability which makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible for affected children to meet developmental milestones in mathematics.

RV Shekhar, a city-based psychologist explained that scolding and beating children as a disciplining tactic won’t help them score better marks if they suffer from dyscalculia. “To identify the problem, parents can make children count from 1 to 100 or higher than that. If the child skips some numbers or gets stuck somewhere then it’s time to seek a clinical psychologist’s help,” Shekhar told TOI.

Teachers who deal with students with learning disabilities welcomed the move of letting them use the calculator, but asserted that a lot more needs to be done to provide quality education for children with special needs in the state.

According to Special Educators’ Federation, there are nearly 1.3 lakh children suffering from various mental disabilities in Andhra Pradesh. Over 1,100 special teachers’ posts for Class IX and X lie vacant.

“A lot many of them did write the exams but the results have been withheld as cases have been filed by teachers working for Sarva Siksha Abhiyan claiming right for those posts,” SEF general secretary Gummala Babu told TOI.

The notification for their recruitment was issued by the government in 2015, but unfortunately, there are not many takers for the posts. While Telangana government has seven schools meant for students with special needs. Andhra Pradesh which is a bigger state has only four in Hindupur, Chirala, Vizag and Vizianagaram.

Titles on Periyar were sought at the book fair

CHENNAI: The controversy surrounding Rajinikanth’s comments on Dravidar Kazhagam founder Periyar has led to a spike in the demand for books on the rational leader. At the just-concluded book fair in the city, there was renewed interest in books on Periyar.

Publishers, who participated in the fair, said titles on Periyar were one of the most sought.

Suba Veerapandian, founder of Karunchattai Pathipagam, a publication that deals with books on social justice, said sales of books on Periyar jumped by almost two times. “We sold nearly 2,000 books on Periyar in the book fair last year. It touched 3,500 this year. While repeated adverse remarks by various political leaders against Periyar sparked an interest among people, the recent comments of Rajinikanth increased the demand,” he said. Youngsters aged between 25 and 35 searched for books on the leader, he said.

At the golden jubilee celebrations of Tamil magazine ‘Thuglak’ in Chennai last week, Rajinikanth spoke about a rally led by Periyar in Salem in 1971. Rajinikanth had said that “portraits of Rama and Sita without clothes, decorated with garlands of slippers” were carried by people in the rally.

Booksellers and publishers said there was a growing interest among readers to understand the life and philosophy of Periyar. Nagarajan K, Booksellers and Publishers Association of South India vice-president and publisher of Bharathi Puthakalayam, said Periyar was the most-searched title in the online catalogue of the association’s official portal. ‘E V Ramasamy Engira Naan’ was one the most-sold titles on the leader, he said.

New publishers such as ‘Neelam Publications’, who have a range of titles on social reformers and rational leaders, said political awareness among the masses was palpable. Anbu of Neelam Publications said visitors to the book fair wanted to know the veracity of information available on leaders. “We can see a political awareness among the readers who want to understand the depth of these issues,” he said.

Dravidar Kazhagam said the spurt in demand for titles on Periyar was not related to the controversy triggered by Rajinikanth. V Anburaj, general secretary of Dravidar Kazhagam, said books on Periyar have been in high demand for the past two years. “In the current political scenario and crisis, Periyar’s ideas provide a solution,” he said. “There is no link between Rajinikanth’s remarks and sale of books on Periyar,” he said.

VELLORE: Three days after a 3-ft panchaloha idol kept in the sanctum sanctorum of a 90-year-old Krishna temple was stolen, the Arcot police on Wednesday arrested two people, including a habitual bike lifter, and retrieved the idol hidden by them in a drainage channel near Konan Colony in Arcot.

A senior police officer identified the arrested as D Sathiya, 40, of Konan Dalit Colony, and K Kannan, 44, of Krishnavaram in the town. The temple is located on Kanar Bajanai Street.

On Sunday, when priest Rajesh Sharma, 30, came to open the temple, he was shocked to find the panchaloha idol of the main deity missing.

According to prime accused Sathiya’s confession, he was involved in bike lifting cases and sought to lead a luxurious life. “Fearing arrest, we decided to hide the stolen idol in a drainage channel. Unfortunately, when we dropped the idol, a hand broke. Believing that the damaged idol would fetch only a low rate in the black market, we opted to repair it before sales. When we were searching for the broken hand, a resident spotted us and alerted police,” he said.

Police retrieved the idol and are on the look out for another accused who is reportedly absconding with the broken idol part.

Speaking to TOI, Anandhan, inspector of the Arcot police station, said the idol is now at the police station and will be handed over to the temple authorities following investigation.

Pune: The Shivajinagar police arrested two men from Lonavla for preparing fake documents of a land measuring six hectares at Kamshet and submitting them in the small causes’ court in Shivajinagar as genuine.

Inspector Manisha Zende of Shivajinagar police said, “The incident came to light after the current landowner realised the fraud and obtained all genuine documents from the revenue department. The matter was brought to the notice of the court and a complaint was registered.”

Zende said that police arrested Anil Savji Vadgama (50) and his associate Vijay Haribhau Kamble (52), both residents of Lonavla.

Zende said that a cheating and forgery case was registered in November 2019 against them by a company owner, a resident of Pali Hill in Bandra, Mumbai. “The two men had been evading arrest for a month. Two cheating cases, including land fraud, have been registered against them ,” Zende said.

“Three years ago, Vadgama and Kamble approached the company officials and said that the land belonged to them. Following this, the dispute was taken to the small causes’ court. During a hearing last year, the duo submitted a map of the land with forged signatures and stamps of revenue authorities.

The company officials obtained the original map of the land from the revenue department following which the forgery came to light, Zende said.

142,['23/01/2020'],"3 months on, Metro Phase II plan pending at Mantralaya","This story is from January 23, 2020

Nagpur: The Phase II of Nagpur Metro was cleared by state cabinet in January 2019 and the Union cabinet was expected to approve it in March 2019. However, the proposal is yet to reach the Union cabinet.

A MahaMetro official said that the reason for the delay was change in norms by the Union ministry for housing and urban affairs (MoHUA). “Some months ago, MoHUA decided, after a detailed study, that Metro light coaches should be used for tier II and tier III cities. This is because Metros in middle sized cities do not have much ridership. MoHUA asked us to revise the proposal for Nagpur Metro Phase II as per new norms,” he added.

Metro light coaches are a foot less longer than regular Metro. They can carry 750 passengers instead of 1,000. These coaches can carry 24,000 passengers per hour while regular Metro’s capacity is 30,000 passengers per hour. Their weight is 12 tonne instead of 16 tonne of the regular ones. Consequently, they cost less.

“We explained to MoHUA officials that we planned to use the coaches of the existing Metro for four corridors — Automotive Square to Kamptee, Prajapati Nagar to Transport Nagar, Khapri to Butibori and Lokmanya Nagar to Hingna Tehsil office. They asked us to use Metro light coaches for Wasudeo Nagar to Dattawadi spur. We accordingly revised our project and submitted it to the state urban development department. It has been three months since then. MoHUA officials have assured to clear the proposal as soon as it is received from the state,” said the official.

The cost of Phase II was Rs11,612 crore as per the detailed project report (DPR). Now, it has been reduced by Rs650 crore to Rs10,962 crore.

Many experts feel that ridership of Phase I Metro will not increase significantly until Phase II becomes operational. This is because people regularly travel to places connected by Phase II — for example Kamptee and Butibori — using public transport. They will use Metro instead of buses. Phase I was designed assuming that Mihan will employ thousands of people. However, Mihan is yet to take off.

BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis was chief minister till September. One could have expected speedy clearance of Phase II from Mantralaya when he was at the helm. Now, Shiv Sena’s Eknath Shinde is the urban development minister and local ministers will have to press him for clearing the project immediately.

Berlin Jose, founder of the NGO, in his petition stated that he was detained at the Madurai Central Prison, pursuant to the detention order passed by the Madurai collector on November 21, 2019. The order was passed only on the ground that a case was registered against him under Pocso Act.

He stated that the detaining authority could pass the order only to prevent the detenu from indulging in activities that are prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and such orders should not be passed on mere assumptions. Even though a case was registered against him, it would not cause any disturbance to public peace and tranquillity as mentioned in the order.Hence, the petitioner filed a habeas corpus petition seeking to set aside the detention order and set him at liberty. A division bench of justice T Raja and justice B Pugalendhi issued notice to the state government returnable in two weeks.

Nagpur: Maharashtra state unit of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has adopted the model of adolescence education campaign, ‘Beti Padhao Beta Samjhao’, introduced by its Nagpur branch. IMA Maharashtra will run this campaign on the state level in 2020 through its Adolescence Health Education Committee (AHEC). IMA has appointed a team of Nagpur-based doctors for the state-level activity.

Dr Majusha Giri, honorary secretary of IMA Nagpur, will be the chairperson of this committee. IMA president Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala will be executive member while senior member of state IMA and sexologist Dr Sanjay Deshpande will guide the state-level implementation of the campaign.

As part of this campaign, IMA will conduct half-day informative seminar on adolescent health, and how schoolteachers can deal with it, for schoolteachers. Doctors will discuss physical changes in adolescents, brain development and peer pressure, addictions, media, and abuse during adolescent period, relationship and sexuality in adolescent ages groups and other points. Separate seminars will be conducted for students also.

“The model of adolescent education that educates both teachers and students in schools will be implemented statewide this year. Doctors from Nagpur have been given this responsibility. Through its statewide implementation, we are looking forward to making national IMA also adopt this model for the entire country,” said Dr Manjusha Giri.

Dr Sanjay Deshpande said the committee will also work on concept of ‘doctor as a sex educator’. “We will train IMA members from various branches, who will visit schools and conduct lectures for teachers and students. A state conference in this regard will be organized in March,” he said.

Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala said, “Adolescence is a crucial phase in student life. Internal changes affect relationships in both social and academic sphere. It is important for teachers to acquire skills and provide a safety net at school. The committee will provide these skills to teachers.”

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) officials on Tuesday said they would soon fix responsibility after finding synthetic food colour in the tea masala of Yewale tea .

“We will seek state FDA commissioner’s (Mumbai) permission for filing a case regarding the food Act violation,” S S Deshmukh, FDA’s joint commissioner (food), Pune division, told TOI.

“An FDA team visited Yewale Food Products in Kondhwa and collected samples of tea powder, tea masala (pack and loose) and sugar on September 21, 2019. It seized a stock, worth Rs5 lakh and kept with the distributor, on suspicion and with label shortcomings,” he said.

“The report of the state health laboratory (Pune) stated that the samples were of required standards. We sent the samples again for testing at the referral laboratory in Mysuru on November 13, 2019. The report stated that the tea masala (loose) sample had tartrazine synthetic food colour. The item was declared unsafe,” Deshmukh said.

Yewale tea director Navnath Yewale said, “We do not know about the new report. It concerns our product so we should have been informed of it. We feel it is a conspiracy against us.

AHMEDABAD: Nirali Barot (name changed), 39, a travel firm owner in Canada and an overseas citizen of India (OCI), is camping in Anand for the past few days. “I got married 10 years ago and have been trying to conceive for about nine. My uterus is not competent to sustain a pregnancy leading to miscarriages. Surrogacy is the only hope if I want my own flesh and blood,” says Barot.

Hundreds of couples and individuals like Barot have pinned their hopes on the Rajya Sabha select committee which is to examine aspects of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019, which aims to end to commercial surrogacy in India. The committee visited Anand on Wednesday to meet various stakeholders. In the next two days, the members will travel to Hyderabad and Mumbai.

While stakeholders who were part of the discussion refused to divulge details of discussion, sources said that it’s likely that issues from the mandate, such as Anand's surrogacy services, it’s impact on women working as surrogate mothers, the economics of these services, eligibility for services etc, were discussed with surrogate mothers, fertility experts, parents and NGOs.

“We are often advised, why don’t we go for adoption. Have they tried the adoption procedure?” asked Barot. “I don’t mind adoption. But the procedure takes three to four years, doesn’t provide us with choice and is more expensive than current surrogacy cost.”

Dr Nayana Patel, the founder of Akanksha Hospital in Anand, who put the town on the global map through a record number of surrogacy cases over the past 15 years, said that in several cases surrogacy is the only feasible answer. “How would one address the wish of a woman or couple to have their own child when other options are exhausted?” she asked.

Infertility experts from across India have created momentum against the bill’s provisions since November 2019, which aims to end commercial surrogacy and promote altruist surrogacy that requires a close relative of family to step forward and carry the couple’s pregnancy. Already, an MHA notification has prohibited commercial surrogacy for foreign nationals, NRI and OCI couples, couples with children and single parents, among others.

Dr Abhirajsinh Jadeja (name changed), a gynaecologist, wants to become a single father. “I was in a long-term relationship which did not have a good ending. I don’t know whether I will in another relationship now. Should that decide whether I am eligible to have a child of my own? I could have a child when commercial surrogacy had still not hit rough waters but I was not ready then,” he said. “Why single out single parents? I believe from my experience that they are better equipped to handle a child with a family support.”

‘Uncertain about future’

The most vocal opponents of the Bill, however, were the surrogate mothers. Close to 100 women are in various stages of pregnancy at Dr Patel’s clinic. The women are generally from Anand district and are often related. “This is my second surrogacy. In 2017, I conceived for the first time and managed to make money enough to send my two children to school and save some to build my own house. I am separated from my husband and with just a primary education, I won’t be able to earn this much in any organized vocation,” said Alka, a surrogate mother.

Meena, another mother who is pregnant for a couple from Bengaluru, said that she is paid through cheque. “The government should surely crack down on exploitative practices, but indiscriminate action will do more harm than good for both surrogates and aspiring parents,” she said.

Mysuru: The Mysuru City Corporation has found a novel way to recycle tonnes of plastic waste dumped at its solid waste management unit in Sewage Farm, Vidyaranyapuram. The authorities have given a contract to mechanical engineer Darshan C, 26, whose startup converts waste to wealth.

The engineer from Srirampura 2nd Stage, who passed out from Vidyavardhaka College of Engineering in 2015, developed a plastic processing unit he wants to patent. Darshan, who used to travel near the landfill at Vidyaranyapuram while going to college, decided to design a machine to process plastic waste which is a threat to the environment. After graduating, he joined as an design engineer in a company and in a free time, he came up with a machine to recycle plastic waste into interlock pavers.

Darshan said every day nearly 80 tonnes of plastic is dumped at Sewage Farm. “I gave a presentation to MCC officials about my device and they agreed to give me an opportunity to manage the plastic waste.”

His device mixes and melts waste plastic covers and waste granite dust to produce interlock pavers which are used for pavements. “I set up Jagruth Tech Pvt Ltd in December. MCC gave the approval for 100 ft x 100 ft land inside the SWM unit at Sewage Farm where recycling will start in three months,” he said.

The plastic pavers is of better quality than cement pavers. Darshan claimed that cement pavers will have 5-tonne load capacity while his pavers can sustain 60-tonne load weight and can last 15 years. It can also sustain 120 degrees celsius temperature. Making it is cheaper too — Rs 45 per sq ft while cement pavers cost Rs 55.

Darshan said MCC has assured it’ll buy pavers for its civic works. “The authorities have given permission to use 2 tonnes of plastic from which we plan to produce 2,000 pavers in one shift,” he added. Darshan’s college friend Chidananda V and engineer Ramesh Kikkery have been supporting him.

MCC health officer DG Nagaraj told TOI: “We’ve given land at Sewage Farm and production will start in 15 days. He’ll develop pavers under the PPP model.”

AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Wednesday granted conditional bail to Congress leader Hardik Patel , who was arrested after the court issued a warrant against him for skipping court proceedings in a sedition case.

Additional sessions judge B J Ganatra placed a strict condition on Patel for bail, mandating that he never seek adjournments and skip court proceedings to delay the trial in the sedition case, in which two other persons are being tried along with Patel.

On Monday, Patel assured the court that he would never act in a way that could result in a delay of the trial. He also promised the court that he would not tender any adjournment application in the future.

On Saturday, the court issued an arrest warrant against Patel on a request by public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt for Patel’s continued absence in the courtroom during the trial of the 2015 sedition case.

154,['23/01/2020'],CBSE to provide exam calculators to ensure uniformity,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Nagpur: After announcing that students with dyscalculia (difficulty in learning or comprehending) can use calculators during exams, the CBSE said on Wednesday that the board itself will provide the gadget.

The CBSE move will ensure uniformity in the type of calculators being used. This comes as a big relief for school principals who did not have a clarity on the type of calculators to be permitted inside the examination hall.

Sanyam Bhardwaj, controller of examination for CBSE, told TOI that the board is already working on the logistics. “We are waiting to see how many applications will be submitted. Based on this, we will ship out the calculators to schools and exam centres,” he said.

TOI had reported on Wednesday about CBSE’s historic move to allow calculators for students with dyscalculia. Many principals had expressed concern over the nitty-gritty of its implementation as the CBSE’s circular had only mentioned ‘basic arithmetic calculator’.

Some principals told TOI that the CBSE “must mention the brand and model number of calculator to be used so that there’s no ruckus during the exam”.

Now, the CBSE itself has decided to provide calculators. Bhardwaj said, “There are different type of calculators available in the market and you never know which a student would bring. So, it’s better for us to provide them.”

ICSE schools too prefer to retain control over the calculators used by their students during board exams. Raziya Hussain, principal of MSB Institute, said, “The school purchases the calculators and keeps it as part of the inventory. They are used as and when required by students during exams.”

Another student-friendly move by CBSE is to keep the calculator option open for all related subjects. Since it was not mentioned in the earlier circular, many principals felt it was restricted only to math. Bhardwaj said, “Students can use it for physics too. We feel a majority will probably use it for math only.”

January 28 is the last day for students to apply for use of calculator. All requests have to be sent to the school principal. CBSE has clarified that this facility is available to only those students who have already registered themselves under the “children with special needs” category.

MADURAI: Madras high court on Wednesday issued notice to the state government on a plea filed by a suspended sub-inspector of police challenging his conviction and awarding of life imprisonment by a lower court for wrongfully confining a man and shooting him dead with his service revolver in Ramanathapuram district in 2014.

Petitioner A Kalidass stated that he was an SI at S P Pattinam police station in Ramanathapuram district. On October 14, 2014, a person named Aruldass lodged a complaint against Syed Mohammed stating that the latter had tried to kill him for not handing over the bike which was given for repair. A case was registered by the S P Pattinam police and thereafter he instructed three policemen to secure the man from the mechanic workshop situated opposite to the police station.

Kalidass said Syed was under the influence of alcohol when he was brought for inquiry to his room and he attempted to assault him using a knife. He fired three rounds using his service revolver in self-defence and Syed died on the spot. He stated that a case was registered against him which was later transferred to CB-CID.

On November 14, 2019, the Ramanathapuram principal district and sessions court convicted and sentenced him to undergo life imprisonment for the offence under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC and imposed a fine of Rs 2lakh. He stated that currently he has been lodged at the Madurai central prison. He said the lower court had erroneously convicted him even though the prosecution has not proved its case beyond doubt.

A flooded Sahakar Nagar bylane

Nagpur: It didn’t rain on Wednesday, but many bylanes in Sahakar Nagar were flooded. Not just this, water supply to parts of Sahakar Nagar and Gajanan Dham will be affected on Thursday. The reason: A contractor engaged by MSEDCL damaged underground pipeline while laying the discom cable bewteen Sonegaon Lake T-point and Sahakar Nagar on Wednesday.

Residents informed TOI that Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has taken up work to lay underground cables. “On Wednesday afternoon, the workers hit the pipeline damaging it badly resulting in springs of water flowing out from paver blocks of the cement road. As huge quantum of water was flowing out, the nearby lanes were flooded and water also entered a few houses,” the residents said.

After TOI, tipped by the residents, informed NMC’s water works department and Orange City Water, the concerned agencies swung into action and closed the valve to stop water supply to prevent further loss of treated water.

OCW spokesperson said repair work will be taken up on Thursday morning. “A police complaint will also be filed against the contractor for damaging the pipeline. We will also recover the cost of the repairs from the contractor,” the spokesperson added.

Residents also pointed out that the contractor carrying out the discom work was not following any precautionary measures. The pits dug out to lay cable were neither barricaded nor any warning boards were placed where the work was being undertaken, said the residents. Despite complaints to local corporators Pallavi Shamkule and Prakash Bhoyar, no corrective measures were taken, they alleged.

Madurai: Yet another public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed before the Madras high court seeking to conduct the consecration ceremony of Brihadeeswara Temple at Thanjavur district in Tamil.

Dr D Senthilnathan, a resident of Thanjavur district, in his petition, stated that he is the state organiser of Veerathamizhar Munnani of Naam Tamilar Katchi which works for the cultural resurgence among Tamil people. He stated the consecration ceremony of the temple is scheduled on February 5 after 23 years.

The authorities concerned are making arrangements for the ceremony without allowing Tamil and Thirumarai chants. Several devotees have submitted representations seeking to perform the ceremony in Tamil.

Two years ago when a plea was moved before the principal seat seeking to conduct consecration ceremony of Arulmigu Sundarar Temple at Thirunavalur in Villuppuram district, a single judge had directed to conduct the ceremony in Tamil.

Senthilnathan stated that he had also submitted a representation to the authorities concerned to conduct the ceremony of the Big Temple in Tamil, however, no steps were taken in this regard.

Hence, he moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to conduct the ceremony in Tamil by following the Tamil Saivaite Ahama (Thevaram and Thiruvasagam).

161,['23/01/2020'],HC contempt notice prompts registrar to act against 6 officials,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Nagpur: On account of alleged negligence of its own employees, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court took suo motu cognisance and issued contempt notice to its registrar (administration).

A division bench comprising Justice Zaka Haq and Justice Manish Pitale sought explanation from the registrar in this regard while asking him on why contempt action shouldn’t be initiated against him. It was only after the registrar initiated departmental action and censured six employees that contempt notice against him was recalled and proceedings were dropped.

The departmental action was mentioned in the service book record of four of them including Justice Pitale’s personal assistant, Shirastedar, and his court keeper. The staff of Justice Haq, including Shirastedar and personal assistant, were reprimanded for the lapses, HC officials told TOI.

The suo motu cognisance was initiated after Justice Pitale found that his stenographer wasn’t provided with a set of computer and printer when the HC reopened on January 2 after winter vacations. It hampered the court’s work for some time. Taking serious view of the negligence on part of HC officials, the bench observed that it was causing obstruction to delivery of justice and amounts to criminal contempt.

While issuing notice to the registrar, the judges asked him to conduct a probe and inform them about names of employees, who were responsible for the negligence. Subsequently, the registrar zeroed-in on seven officials and sought explanation from them.

The registrar then filed an affidavit on next day with names of the employees and an assurance was given that the mistakes/errors as noticed by HC wouldn’t be repeated. “Accepting the respondent’s assurance, notice issued is recalled and the proceedings are dropped,” the judges held.

During the same proceedings, the bench asked registrar that if names of erring officials were available with him, he should also inform on action taken against them. The registrar then filed another affidavit on the action taken against HC officials, absolving one as no evidence was found against him.

“Seen the affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent where it’s pointed out that departmental action is taken against the erring officers/employees. It was also informed that some orders are passed against them on administrative side. The officers/employees against whom any order is passed will be at liberty to avail remedy as per law, to challenge that order,” the judges said.

PUNE: Parents of a brain-dead laboratory technician (22) donated his vital organs to give a new life to three patients suffering from end-stage renal and liver diseases.

The organs were donated at the DY Patil Medical College and Hospital in Pimpri on January 18, while the transplants were carried out the next day.

The donor from Bidar in Karnataka was on a home visit to collect the blood sample of a patient when he collapsed. He was later diagnosed with intracranial haemorrhage and was shifted to our hospital on January 17,” said DY Patil Medical College and Hospital’s transplant coordinator Mayuri Ghatge.

An intracranial haemorrhage is a type of bleeding that occurs inside the skull.

Ghatge said he was declared brain-dead on January 18, following which his parents consented to donate his kidneys and liver. “The man was the sole-bread winner of the family. He has a younger brother. He had been staying in Pune for last two years,” she said.

“As per the norms of the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC), the man’s liver and one of the kidneys were allocated to two patients enrolled with DY Patil Medical College and Hospital in Pimpri. The man’s another kidney benefited another patient of kidney failure at Poona Hospital,” ZTCC’s transplant coordinator Aarti Gokhale said.

Ghatge said, “The man’s liver was successfully transplanted into a 56-year-old man, a resident of Shriganganagar in Rajasthan. The kidney gave new life to a 35-year-old Pune man. Both the patients are doing good after the transplants and will be discharged in the next few days.”

AHMEDABAD: It seems that civic officials have forgotten the law, as it seems as if their Swachh Bharat dreams have caused them to turn a blind eye to workers being made to enter sewers. One such case occurred in Viramgam town in of Ahmedabad district, where a 45-year-old worker was made to enter a sewer by officials of the Viramgam nagarpalika.

A video of the incident went viral, showing a worker identified as Mahesh Makwana, entering a sewer and removing sludge and stones from it with his hands. When asked what he was doing in the gutter, he said he was ‘just cleaning it’.

Makwana’s colleague, Atul Vaghela, said they work for the Viramgam civic body and for Rs 424 per day to clean sewers.When asked if machines were available to help them clean the sewer, Vaghela said, “Some stones were stuck inside the gutter and Makwana was trying to remove those stones which the machines cannot do. Some type of cleaning has to be done manually.”

The chief officer of Viramgam nagarpalika, Vinod Rathod, said he was unaware of any such incident.

Sources in the nagarpalika said that as the video showing Makwana entering the manhole went viral, Rathod called Vaghela and Makwana and scolded him for entering the manhole in broad daylight and threatened to sack them.Ahmedabad district collector K K Nirala was unavailable for comment on this issue.

In March 2014, the Supreme Court, acting on a PIL filed by Bezwada Wilson, founder of the Safai Karmachari Andolan (SKA), prohibited the practice of making workers enter manholes , septic tanks and sewers. The top court directed the state agencies to pay compensation of Rs 10 lakh for sewer deaths and told the government to identify the families of such workers who had died since 1993, when manual scavenging was first prohibited.

Out of 705 manhole deaths in the country, Gujarat reported 132 deaths between 1993 and January 2019, said activist Kirit Rathod, who blamed the state government’s lackadaisical approach for workers being made to enter manholes. The Gujarat government failed to prevent the practice of manual scavenging and pay compensation to families of of deceased manhole workers. A local NGO had also filed a public interest litigation (PIL) before the Gujarat high court seeking compensation for such families.

While hearing the PIL, the HC had in October last year observed about the state government’s approach, “It appears that, despite pendency of the matter and assurances to the court, the unfortunate situation still prevails under which on one pretext or the other workmen will have to risk their lives.”

“We are at pain to note that there is an absolute lack of sensitivity qua the issue, else this would not have happened. It goes without saying that the follow up, as prescribed under the Act needs to be placed on record qua those deaths also,” the HC stated.

CUDDALORE: A 24-year-old man has been arrested on charges of posting a nude photograph of his former girlfriend on a social networking site. The arrested was identified as K Kalaiarasan of Kandachipuram in Villupuram district.

Police said Kalaiarasan was staying in the house of a relative in Cuddalore district and was working in a cellphone service shop. He befriended a 22-year-old woman working in the shop and later proposed to her. She accepted his proposal and the couple was in a relationship for the past three years.

Her parents, on learning about her affair, disapproved of it as they both hailed from different communities.

After this, the woman began avoiding Kalaiarasan following her parents’ advice, angering him.

Kalaiarasan decided to take revenge on her. The woman had earlier sent him a nude photo of her following repeated requests. He opened a new account on a social media site and uploaded the photo there. The woman and her parents were shocked to learn about the incident and lodged a complaint with the Cuddalore all-women police station.

Police booked Kalaiarasan under Sections 417 (punishment for cheating) and 376 (punishment for rape) of the IPC and 67 (punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act and arrested him. Police produced him before a local court that remanded him in judicial custody.

Representational Image

NAGPUR: Doctors working in small towns, villages and in remote areas can now get updated clinical knowledge through online continuous medical education (CME) facility launched by the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC).

After accessing the online CME for six hours and answering a small questionnaire, doctors will get three credit points. These points are useful when doctors renew their registration with MMC.

“MMC launched this facility on a beta basis. A doctor can earn up to six credit points from online CMEs,” said Dr Vinky Rughwani, vice-president of MMC.

Doctors need to earn 30 points in five years to get renewal for the next five years. Practice without MMC registration is not allowed.

CMEs are held mostly in metro cities and big towns. Doctors practicing in small towns and remote areas are unable to attend such CMEs. Attending online CME is a good option for them. “We will see the response from doctors. MMC may think of increasing the point limit from six to 12 in the future,” Dr Rughwani added.

MMC’s module for the online CME is foolproof. The software is equipped with face reading facility. Doctors opting for CME must attend it by sitting in front of their laptops/computers/tablets for the entire six-hour duration.

After every CME, they have to answer online questions. They need to answer at least 60% of the questions to get online certificates. Credit hour certificates are generated automatically after completion of the CME and answering the questionnaire.

City’s doctors, who have been associated with organizing CMEs on various topics, felt that the online option is better as it will keep CMEs purely academic. “These days, many CMEs are conducted at tourist spots and doctors attend them just for formality. CMEs are more like get-togethers and not exercises in pure academics. The online mode will update doctors’ knowledge in the true sense and will eventually benefit patients,” said a senior doctor.

Nagpur: Late on Wednesday afternoon, as the news about Supreme Court’s refusal to pass ex parte interim stay on the controversial law CAA spread, citizens from different parts of city began turning up in large numbers at the Jaffar Nagar’s Eidgah ground where Shaheenbagh style protest is underway.

While the number of women swelled beyond 500 to 600, men’s tally too matched them. The protest, organized by Nagpur Peace Organization (NPO), is meant to provide a platform for city women who had been staging the agitation in support of their Delhi counterparts at Shaheenbagh.

The SC development and reports of Union minister Amit Shah saying CAA will be implemented at any cost seemed to have awaken the minorities, who gathered in bigger numbers than the previous three days of this protest that started from January 19. The police permission for extending the protest till January 27 too was turned down even as cops have already ruled out anyone staying at the venue beyond 6pm.

NPO organizers said the protest will conclude on Thursday while an another permission has been moved for next week. A similar protest is likely to be held at Mominpura’s Farooq Nagar ground after this one.

Lawyer Mohammad Fazal said the matter being admitted by SC is an achievement in itself and that a larger bench will now hear it. “Citizens opposing the CAA must not be disheartened over today’s development. Four weeks time is given and there are number of issues for government to reply. Government representatives themselves are not aware of them,” he said.

On Shah’s comment, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (West zone) member Zeba Khan, who is among the protesters, said the government is pretending as if it is not worried. “Then, why did they cancel their North-East tours? You don’t have Muslims there. This protest is not for one or two days but will continue for next four years,” she said.

NPO members Imran Noorani and Dr Aves Hasan said the SC development and what the home minister said in Lucknow must not be seen in isolation. “These two events are diversionary tactics to keep the nation busy with protest while the economy has crashed,” Dr Hasan said.

College student Ramsha Patel said the government must initiate a direct dialogue with the people. “There should be a solution through face to face dialogue. The government and police have failed the people,” she said.

Engineering student Yumna Ali said, “Amit Shah should know this is not right when so many people are against it. How can he say that the government will implement it at any cost,” she asked.

Housewife Sabiha Patel warned that the government is mistaking if it feels that citizens will settle down after some time. “Today, it is Eidgah, tomorrow it will be some other place. Protests will go on till CAA is scrapped,” she said.

Another housewife Farhana Syed said after this protest, they will start sending four people from each household. “Women are going to pack Delhi from all corners of the country till the law is repealed,” she said.

Teacher Tarannum Firdos said the protest was limited to Shaheenbagh but will spread nationwide. “We are becoming aware. We will not give up,” she said.

DEHRADUN: After laying a trap, the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) on Wednesday arrested an Assistant Garrison Engineer and a Junior Engineer from the Dehradun Garrison Engineer office for accepting a bribe of Rs 40,000 from a Delhi-based contractor for clearing his payment of over Rs 20 lakh.

According to CBI officials, the firm had written a complaint against the two engineers and also submitted an audio recording of the two demanding bribe. Providing details, a senior CBI official said, “The complainant is a registered Military Engineering Service (MES) contractor who was awarded two contracts in 2018 but his payments were due.”

After verifying all evidence and documents, a CBI team under the leadership of Sunil Kumar Lakhera laid the trap and nabbed the two engineers while accepting the bribe. The CBI team also searched the offices and residences of the two engineers. The details of recoveries made from the houses and offices of the two erring officials are yet to be known.

170,['23/01/2020'],Maharashtra: Resident doctors affected with TB to get special leave,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Illustration used for representational purpose

NAGPUR: In a major respite for more than 4,500 resident doctors in 17 government medical colleges in state, the Directorate of Medical Education and research ( DMER ) and ministry of medical education have agreed to sanction a special 2-month leave for resident doctors in case they get affected with tuberculosis (TB) while on duty.

While treating TB patients in hospitals, at least 100 resident doctors fall prey to tuberculosis every year. TB-affected doctors cannot work in hospitals. So, they go on leave until they recover up to the level that their infection report comes negative. This period varies from three weeks to four months.

As per old rules, residents going on TB leave had to compensate this period by working additionally after the end of their three-year tenure. But now, there will be no need to compensate this leave as it will be considered as part of their tenure. Doctors will get up to two months of such on-duty leave. This was one of the long-pending demands of the Maharashtra Association of resident Doctors (MARD).

“TB has been recognized as occupational disease by various authorities including Maharashtra Univeristy of Health Sciences. Resident doctors working in TB wards are on high risk of TB. Long working hours, poor living conditions are already taking toll of our health. In such condition, TB treatment needs to be given proper recovery period,” said Dr Kalyani Dongre, President of central MARD.

“While redressing a case filed by a resident from Nair Hospital in Mumbai, the DMER and authorities have allowed 2 months of special leave without extension or compensatory work period to the concerned doctor. This is a milestone decision and we will use it as a reference in future,” said Dr Ashutosh Jadhav, General Secretary of Central MARD who is from Nagpur.

DMER director Dr T P Lahane said that doctors getting infected with TB while they are on duty will get such leave. “Leave up to two months has been permitted for treatment and need not to be compensated by working additionally. This will benefit resident doctors,” he said.

Sharad Pawar to resolve stipend issue

A delegation of central MARD, on Wednesday, met NCP supremo Sharad Pawar in Mumbai. Members of the delegation claimed that Pawar gave them patient hearing and forwarded their proposal of stipend hike to medical education ministry and finance ministry. “We also spoke to medical education minister Amit Deshmukh. He has asked us to present the stipend pattern of central government for his reference. We will give the presentation at the earliest,” said Dr Ashutosh Jadhav, General secretary of central MARD. Residents also issued an official statement thanking Sharad Pawar in advance for forwarding their proposal of stipend hike. “We hope this new government brings change and we get our stipend hike soon,” reads the statement.

This image has been used for representational purpose only

MADURAI/CHENNAI: Khadi and Village Industries minister G Baskaran has stirred a hornet’s nest by saying that AIADMK is waiting for an opportunity to break free from its alliance with the BJP as the people had not voted for the party in the rural local body elections because of the alliance. The minister also went on to say that there was a lot of opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act among the ministers.

Baskaran was speaking at a function to commemorate the 103rd birth anniversary of AIADMK founder MGR at Ilayankudi in Sivaganga on Tuesday. “You have spurned us, but we won’t. We are waiting for opportunity to break off from the alliance with the BJP. All the ministers are opposed to the CAA,” he said.

However, on Wednesday senior minister and AIADMK spokesperson D Jayakumar said Baskaran’s statement may be treated as his individual view and it has nothing to do with the party’s policy decision on the alliance. “Only the party leadership will take a call on the alliance. The leadership will take the final call ahead of the 2021 assembly elections and that will depend on the political climate,” Jayakumar told TOI. When confronted by newsmen on Wednesday at Karaikudi, Baskaran sought to ‘clarify’ that only his comment regarding CAA was correct and that their alliance with BJP was inseparable.

Responding to Baskaran’s claim, BJP general secretaries K S Narendran and Vanathi Srinivasan said the party would prefer to ignore the views of any individual functionary or minister. “The two parties have an electoral alliance which will continue. The ally’s spokesperson has also clarified it and denied the statement of his cabinet colleague over the alliance,” said Narendran. Vanathi Srinivasan said they would be concerned only if they hear it from the “horse’s mouth”. Jayakumar has cautioned party functionaries and ministers from expressing their views on the alliance or internal matters of the party at open forums.

Baskaran had also said that AIADMK candidates had lost by three or five votes in the recently concluded local body elections. This in spite of the district administration being under the control of the ruling party. ``If we wanted we could have turned these losses into victories, but we acted fairly on the directions of chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami,’’ he said. ``Can you expect the same from a DMK government? They will beat you up and make you fall in line,’’ he said.

MADURAI: Only seven of the hundreds of ‘share’ autorickshaws running in the city, have been registered with the regional transport offices in Madurai, a RTI (Right to Information) reply has revealed.

General secretary of the Madurai Consumer Protection Centre, G Muniasamy , had filed the RTI to find out how many share autorickshaws of the total 12,223 three-wheel autos operating with permits in Madurai, had permits. There are three regional transport offices - Madurai South, Madurai North and Madurai Central - in Madurai, which are authorised to provide numbers starting with TN 58, TN 59 and TN 64. The reply to the RTI on share autos says that Madurai north has one share auto plying with a permit, Madurai south six and Madurai central none.

Founder of Makkal Vizhipunarvu Trust K Hakkim, said the RTI shows that there are only 12,223 autorickshaws in the city, but there should be at least 25000 vehicles operating on the city roads. Many of them are three-wheel ‘share’ autos which carry more than the permitted number of three passengers.

“Just stand in front of the Periyar bus stand, where work is underway. There will not be less than 30 share autos at any given time,” he said. Hence, these unauthorised vehicles are posing a risk to the public who travel in them, he added.

The three-wheel autos have permits to carry only three passengers at a time. But, many of them have been altered in the name of share autos, with a two-tier back seat at two levels and they carry more than 10 passengers at a time. “They are cheaper than mini buses and more convenient as they stop wherever we tell them to. So, I take these share autos regularly for just Rs 10 for a four km journey,” said A Selvarani of Anna Nagar.

RTO officials told TOI that the share autos which were given permits were those with five seats, and permission to carry five passengers at a time. “Many so called share autos are violating the rules when they carry more than three passengers. We impound not less than 50 to 100 vehicles per day, but we are not able to control the menace,” they acknowledged.

Nagpur: Rashtra Sant Tukadoji (RST) Regional Cancer Hospital, the only charitable cancer hospital in the region having tertiary cancer care centre (TCCC) status, will get an advanced linear accelerator machine used for providing more precise treatment to cancer patients.

Linear accelerator device is used for external beam radiation treatment of cancer patients. It delivers high-energy X-rays or electrons to the patient’s tumour. The device costs more than Rs20 crore.

“The machine will be of great benefit to poor cancer patients coming to the RST from the periphery of Vidarbha. It will reach RST by February 7,” said Dr Subhrajit Dasgupta, director of RST.

Dr Dasgupta also shared alarming facts from the latest figures released in the global adult tobacco survey.

“One good news is that tobacco consumption in Maharashtra has gone down from 31% to 25% in last six years. But, the same has doubled when it comes to the adolescence age of 15 to 17 years,” he said. Prevalence of tobacco use among persons aged between 15 to 17 has increased from 2.9% to 5.5% in last six years.

The RST has planned a series of events from February 2 to February 9 to mark World Cancer Day, which is observed on February 4.

For the first time since its inception, the hospital will organize a national oration in memory of Pt Shivkaran Sharma Chhangani, one of the founder members of the RST. This oration will be held on February 2 at 10am. Dr GK Rath, head of National Cancer Institute of AIIMS, New Delhi, will deliver a talk on ‘Cancer control programme in India’. This oration will be followed by a daylong academic exercise on recent advances in oncology.

National-level faculties will speak on radiotherapy, cancer immunotherapy, nanotechnology, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancers and breast cancer on the occasion.

On February 4, the institute has organized an awareness programme and a human chain will be formed on the hospital premises from 8.30am onwards. On February 9, it will host an academic event along with Indian Medical Association (IMA) Nagpur chapter. Renowned experts in the field of pulmonology, histopathology and medical oncology will share updates on lung cancer.

Dr BK Sharma and Dr Prasanna Joshi, both joint directors of the hospital, and Dr Ramkrishna Chhangani, chairman of the oration committee, informed that more than 20 social organizations and colleges in Nagpur will participate in the public awareness event on February 4.

NAGPUR: MahaMetro , which has been asked by Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari to execute Jai Stambh Square traffic improvement scheme, plans to partially raze the Station Road flyover next month. However, opposition by shopkeepers to be affected may stall the plan.A MahaMetro official said that Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had directed the agency to first rehabilitate the shopkeepers and then go in for the demolition. “There are 72 shopkeepers whom we have to rehabilitate. We have already constructed 40 temporary shops near the railway station and another 20 will be ready by the end of the month. Once the shopkeepers shift to the new shops, we will start demolishing the flyover from one side,” he added.The official said that the remaining shopkeepers wanted monetary compensation instead of shops. “It is yet to be decided as to who will pay the money, MahaMetro or NMC,” he further said.MahaMetro has plans to construct a big commercial complex to house the shops. It will be connected to the railway station by a foot overbridge. The agency will also construct a multi-level parking near the complex. City buses will use the ground floor while upper floors will be used for parking four-wheelers and two-wheelers.The flyover has to be demolished as MahaMetro wants to construct a six-lane road in front of the railway station. As defence land is required for the road, it will first construct a four-lane road and when the land becomes available another two lanes will be added.There are 165 shops below the flyover. The shopkeepers have two unions. The first union has owners of 72 shops, which existed before the flyover was constructed. They were allotted the shops by NMC at a cost of Rs8 lakh each. These shops are located in front of railway station entrances. The other union has 93 shopkeepers having their establishments away from the entrances. They got the shops by paying Rs10.20 lakh.The 93 shopkeepers don’t want new shops, but monetary compensation. They had met Gadkari, who agreed to their demand. They will meet mayor Sandip Joshi in this regard on Thursday morning.Nilesh Khorgade, leader of these shopkeepers, said, “We will be allotted shops at the backside and hence we won’t get any customers. Even now, we don’t get many customers as our establishments are at a distance from the entrance. We, therefore, want cash.”The other set of shopkeepers are not ready to shift to the temporary shops. “There are no drains and water connections in the complex. Most of the shops here are eateries. How will we function without drain and water? NMC must construct the commercial complex first and then demolish the flyover,” said Ramu Wankhede. Another shopkeeper said that he would approach the court if he was forced to shift to the temporary shops.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73548505,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-687900,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/partial-demolition-of-railway-station-flyover-next-month/articleshow/73531263.cms
178,['23/01/2020'],Tamil Nadu: ‘Existing homebuyers can’t object to increase in units’,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Representative image

CHENNAI: In an order that allows promoters to tweak plans for upcoming phases in a real estate project to increase the number of dwelling units , Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority ( TNRERA ) has said that developers need to execute projects depending on market requirement. The realty regulator also dismissed a complaint by a homebuyer, who owns an apartment in a block, objecting to the developer’s move to raise the number of units, modifying the initial planning permission.

The case pertains to a gated community project, ‘Viva City’, at Kannivakkam near Guduvanchery, developed by XS Real Properties Pvt Ltd. According to complainants J Sethu Ragu Raman and D Sathiyapriya, who purchased an apartment in the project, the gated community was advertised as a development comprising seven blocks with 352 units, with two and three BHK apartments ranging from 583 sqft to 1,084 sqft having various common amenities.

While 176 dwelling units were built as per the approved DTCP plan in 2013, the developer obtained a revised planning permission to increase the number of dwelling units to 571, a rise of 219 units or more than 50%, for the new project, ‘En Veedu’, on the same premises. Noting that the developer was duty bound to get the consent of the purchasers before modifying the plan, the complainant said it was illegal.

In response, the developer said due to recession and depressed market conditions, they could not proceed with the phased development as planned “originally”. With the Centre launching the PMAY scheme that facilitates subsidy on EMI on housing projects for first-time buyers in 2016, the developer, through a subsidiary, obtained a revised approval for two existing blocks and fresh approvals for upcoming phases from DTCP in October 2017. The size of the apartments was tweaked — measuring 60 square metres per dwelling unit — to make the buyers eligible under the PMAY scheme. The homebuyers gave their consent for changes in undeveloped portions, the developer said, adding that the revised plan was as per the rules and regulations of DTCP, which has been registered with TNRERA.

After hearing the arguments, TNRERA said the developer completed and handed over the apartments to the complainants three years ago. Stressing that real estate market conditions are dynamic and the builder has to construct apartments according to market needs, the order said the authority was unable to find fault with the developer’s decision to go in for larger number of smaller apartments taking advantage of the Centre’s scheme on affordable housing.

“Therefore, the complaint is devoid of merits and hence it is dismissed,” the order added.

Mysuru: The Economic Census 2020 began on Wednesday in the city with the launch of a mobile application by commissioner of Mysuru City Corporation Gurudatta Hegde.

The enumerators and supervisors who conduct door-to-door survey of houses and commercial establishments to collect data have also been given the task to clear misconception that the census is linked to CAA, NRC or NPR.

The IT-enabled economic census is done by the Common Service Centres (CSC). The CSC has hired 220 supervisors and 890 enumerators who have been trained to collect data on mobile application developed for data capture, validation, report generation and dissemination. They would collect data through door-to-door survey of each household and commercial establishment.

CSC district manager Mahantesh told TOI that the census will be conducted block-wise. “Each block will have 66 investigator units (IV) and each unit will have nearly 400 households and 2,000 people. The survey map has been provided by National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) and Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI). The enumerators are being trained to create awareness to the public on the census and clear the misconception,” he said.

After launching the census, commissioner Gurudatta Hegde said that the public should provide accurate information to the enumerators as the data will be used for implementation of development programmes by the government.

“The census is not related to CAA or NRC or it is done to track the tax defaulters. The enumerators will ask basic questions to which the public should give accurate details. The data collected will be kept strictly confidential and used only for development planning. The enumerators will visit each block thrice during the census to avoid any miss out,” he said.

As there were reports that the enumerators were verbally and physically attacked by miscreants in few districts, commissioner Gurudatta had written to the police to provide necessary security to the enumerators during the door-to-door visit in certain sensitive areas.

In the sixth Economic Census which was held in 2014, there were 1.4 lakh commercial establishments–88,062 in rural and 52,170 in city–in the district.

MCC deputy commissioner (administration) B C Shivananda Murthy was present.

Swachch assessers complete the task

Commissioner Gurudatta said that Swachh Survekshan assessors who had visited the city to inspect cleanliness have concluded the work and have returned.

“Nearly 45,000 people have given their feedback by participating in the survey. We have set a target of more than one lakh feedback. We have organised programmes at Infosys and L& T on Thursday where we encourage them to participate in the citizen feedback to vote for Mysuru,” he said.

Passengers coming from Far East and Southeast Asia will be screened at these counters for fever or any other ailments, which are considered symptoms of the disease. The move was after instructionsfrom the ministries of civil aviation and health affairs to mandatorily implement preventive measures following high alert around the world.Passengers coming from suspected areas, mainly China, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, are being briefed about the health issues and the precautionary measures to be followed. There are no direct flights from China to Kochi and those passengers from China would have to come via Southeast Asian nations or Sri Lanka. Hence, passengers travelling in those flights from these countries are also monitored. There are around eight flights from these countries to Kochi daily.“Special health counters with doctors and paramedical staff have started operating near the immigration desk throughout the airport working hours. Passengers are asked to fill up a form seeking health details. Also, an isolation ward has been set up at the Government Medical College, Ernakulam. So far, 28 passengers (coming indirectly from affected areas) have undergone screening tests. All tests were negative,” said an airport official.The passengers’ passports are being checked to know whether they have been to any of the affected areas recently.

KOLKATA: The transport department will run 400 dedicated buses for Kolkata International Book Fair from 3pm to 9pm. Transport minister Suvendu Adhikari on Wednesday published a booklet detailing the routes in presence of Booksellers and Publishers’ Guild president Tridib Chatterjee and general secretary Sudhanshu Shekhar Dey .The buses will cover all major destinations – Sealdah, Howrah, Parnashree, Behala, Shakuntala Park, Thakurpukur, Garia, Jadavpur, Kamalgazi, Raja Bazar, Habra, Chiria Mor, Barasat, Bally, Baruipur, Barrackpore, Santragachhi, Rathtalam Belgachia, Titagarh, Dankuni and Park Circus. Special shuttle service will be run from Sealdah, Kamalgazi, Tollygunge, Rathtala, Ultadanga.The 44th Kolkata International Book Fair is slated to start on January 29 and end on February 8. The fair will be inaugurated by chief minister Mamata Banerjee.Meanwhile, the Guild has decided to list all old-age homes in the city and donate mini-libraries to them. This, they feel, can be an antidote to loneliness that grips elderly citizens who live away from family. “No one can keep company better than books. “Neither can they visit libraries as frequently as possible nor can most homes afford a library. So we have decided to step in,” said Dey.Efforts are being made to make the event eco-friendly, though the details are not known yet. Guild members said that the state urban development department has laid out elaborate plans for this and is about to announce them soon. CESC, which partners thefair, is doing its bit to serve the environment. It will publicise the use of electric vehicles and will also have an electric two-wheeler parked at the fair along with a charging point to encourage book lovers to vote for these emission-free modes of transport.The theme country of the fair this year is Russia. “We will have the ambassador of Russia to India, Kudashev Nikolay Rishatovich, and many dignitaries and writers from Russia at the fair,” said Chatterjee. Other than Russia, 20 countries will participate in the fair.

Nagpur: A public trust means an entity express or implied for either a public, religious or charitable purpose or both, and includes a temple, or any other religious or charitable endowment and a society formed either for a religious or charitable purpose or for both. A trust is registered under the Societies Registration Act of 1860. There is no central act to govern public trusts, but various states have enacted their own laws according to their conditions and administration. The funds belonging to the trust need to be spent on the objects stated for the trust. This can be ensured if required transparency is maintained in the day to day operations of trusts, said additional commissioner of income tax (exemption) Dr Kishor Dhule.

He was addressing a seminar on public trusts organized by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) as a chief guest.

Dhule said a public trust is set up for the specific benevolent purpose for the benefit and need of the beneficiaries who may not be specifically defined in the trust deed. Management of the trusts should not be left unchecked, so that the purpose for which the trust is set up is not vitiated.

Vijayawada: A 60-year-old woman and her 40-year-old son sustained serious burn injuries after they were attacked with acid at Voletivaripalem village in Prakasam district on Tuesday. The injured were identified as Puvvada Ramesh (40) and his mother Lakshmi Kotamma (60), both from the same village and they run a private business.

According to Voletivaripalem police, the incident happened at around 6.30 pm when the accused Medikonda Anjaiah (28), who runs a milk booth, had a heated argument with them over delay in payment. Cops said that the victims had gone to Anjaiah’s milk booth to repay the balance amount they owed him, when tempers flared and Anjaiah abused both the mother and son over the delay in payment. He even threatened to attack them with the acid that was lying on the side.

Cops said that when Ramesh was leaving, Kotamma, provoked by Anjaiah’s arguments, dared him to try throwing acid at them.

In a fit of rage, Anjaiah took the bottle of the concentrated acid and threw it on the mother and son, causing grievous injuries.

Locals rushed the two victims to a local government hospital. Both of them have been declared out of danger, but Kotamma, being a senior citizen, is still struggling to respond to treatment.

Cops arrested Anjaiah and registered an attempt to murder case against him. Further investigation is still on.

188,['23/01/2020'],South traffic guard black spots keep cops worried,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Kolkata: The south traffic guard — comprising some of the posh zones, including Park Street and Maidan — is now home to Kolkata’s latest accident black spots. Review meetings on fatal accidents in November and December at Lalbazar have revealed that there have been nine deaths under this guard, most of them involving bus passengers. Worse, the trend continues in the new year as well.

Most of these deaths were reported from two important thoroughfares —JL Nehru Road (at the Park Street crossing) and AJC Bose Road (a part of it is under Vidyasagar traffic guard too). Accidents were also recorded on Mayo Road and Dufferin Road.

Sources said that an analysis of CCTV footage showed that the bus bay at the Park Street crossing was proving to be inadequate to accommodate so many vehicles during peak hours. “Some buses, especially government buses, tend to use the car lanes and stop in the middle of the road. Buses on same routes also race with one another, forcing passengers to get off or board on road. In their hurry, they become careless. Some trying to board with luggage fell on the road, leading to accidents,” said a police officer.

The erratic pedestrian movement — like getting off moving bus and trying to cross over, turning a blind eye to signals — has also led to accidents, claimed an officer present at the review meeting. “The failure to dereserve tram tracks on Dufferin Road to facilitate bus movement has also contributed to the rising number of accidents in this area,” said an officer from the south traffic guard.

“Both RR Avenue and Dufferin Road are death traps. Several accidents have been reported earlier — two persons losing their arms and a sergeant losing his leg — from these areas. For the time being, we want the buses to stop at the designated stop on RR Avenue. The usual practice is to race out of SN Banerjee road, use the middle flank and try and cross the Curzon Park signal in a jiffy. With the road now further constricted due to Metro works, monitoring the zone is a challenge. We will also try to restrict pedestrian movement,” said an officer.

MADURAI: Panchayat representatives are instrumental in taking various government schemes to the people and making them benefit from the same. The role of panchayat presidents and vice-presidents is crucial for the development of panchayats, minister for revenue, disaster management and IT, R B Udayakumar said on Wednesday. He was speaking after inaugurating a one-day training programme for elected local body representatives, including panchayat presidents and vice-presidents in Madurai. Udayakumar said that chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had ordered the programme for all elected representatives to inform them of their duties. The central and state governments are implementing many welfare schemes through the rural local bodies, for the social and economic upliftment of the people in villages.

It is the responsibility of the president to ensure that there is potable water, street lights and other basic amenities in the villages. Udayakumar said that the panchayat representatives should give priority for the implementation of various government schemes, including Mahatma Gandhi Rural employment generation scheme, greenhouse scheme, Swachh Bharat mission, in their villages. Village panchayat presidents and vice-presidents from Thirumangalam, Kallikudi, T Kallupatti, Sedapatti, Usilampatti, Chellampatti and Thiruparankundram were also told that they should work and perform with an aim to receive awards for best panchayat chiefs in the next Republic Day, when their services would be evaluated and recognised.

In Dindigul, district collector M Vijayalakshmi presided over the meeting. The collector said that local bodies were the basis of the democratic set up of the country. By enhancing basis infrastructure and facilities, social justice and economic upliftment can be established in villagers. Income of villagers have been enhanced through government schemes. Kudimaramathu works, power supply, and solid waste management was implemented well in the villages. Also, all financial transactions in villages must be done through electronic transactions, so panchayat representatives should be prepared for the same, she said.

191,['23/01/2020'],Chackai flyover to be opened in a week,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Finally, the national highway authority of India (NHAI) is gearing up to open the Chackai flyover as its construction, barring a few minor works, has been completed. Within a week, NHAI will partially open the flyover to facilitate traffic of vehicles from Kovalam to Kollam side.

As the construction of one slip road from the left side of the stretch from Kazhakoottam to Karode is yet to be completed, the NHAI will take some more time to open the other side for traffic. NHAI sources said the flyover will be fully opened after 10 days.

NHAI sources said the load tests conducted on the flyover last month were successful. The load tests were performed by placing fully-loaded trucks on the flyover to check its strength.

Though the NHAI is getting ready to open the flyover, the ongoing works of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) to reconstruct the manhole at Enchakkal Junction is troubling the agency. Sources said it would take a minimum of 10 days for the work to be completed.

“Currently, Enchakkal Junction witnesses heavy traffic congestion. While the traffic chaos at Chackai will be resolved with the opening of flyover, it is going to worsen at Enchakkal. The ongoing works of the KWA will add more trouble,” NHAI sources said.

Meanwhile, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has given a shocker to the NHAI by giving an estimate of Rs 1.75 crore for lighting the streetlights installed on the flyover. The KSEB had cited lack of feeder in nearby area as the reason for the exorbitant estimate. After the issue sparked a controversy, the KSEB conducted a joint inspection with the NHAI and is revising the estimate. A KSEB official said the new estimate, which will be much lesser than the earlier one, will be submitted within two days.

NHAI will power the streetlights using a generator till the issue with the KSEB is resolved.

NHAI sources said the state, which refused to share the flyover’s cost, has not given any respite in terms of powering the streetlights too. The NHAI was forced to construct the flyover at Chackai after the state government refused to raze down the approach to the airport.

The Chackai flyover consists of a two-lane bridge parallel to the existing railway over bridge. The 1050-metre-long flyover is constructed as a continuation of the ROB with around 42 spans. The width of the flyover is 19.6 metres, with two carriage ways of 9-metre width, a central median and crash barrier on either sides.

KOCHI: RDS group, which was the contractor for Palarivattom flyover , has approached the Kerala high court to appoint an agency to conduct the load test at its expense.

The company alleged that the state government has not finalized an agency to conduct the load test, which is essential to conclude the instability of the flyover, even though two months has passed since the high court’s order on November 21t.

State attorney K V Sohan submitted before a division bench led by chief justice S Manikumar that the government has approached the Supreme Court against the order of November 21 and that the load test can be conducted within a week if the apex court’s decision is not in favour of the government. Based on the government’s submission, the court has postponed further hearing to February 5.

The collector on Wednesday announced that vehicular traffic along the junction will be regulated from February 1 onwards to facilitate the works and that the traffic regulations will continue till March 30.

As Kazhakootam is the intersection point of old NH-47 and NH-66, the regulations are sure to create huge congestions in the junction.

According to the statement issued by collector K Gopalakrishnan, vehicles going from Kollam to Thiruvananthapuram city direction will be diverted at AJ Hospital Junction and will be directed via Market Road to reach Kazhakootam Junction. From the junction, the vehicles can proceed either towards Sreekaryam or towards Technopark direction along the service road. Vehicles going from Sreekaryam to Kollam direction will also be directed via Market Road from Kazhakootam Junction along which they can enter the highway at AJ Hospital Junction.

“We will be conducting a trial run of these regulations during next week. Appropriate changes will be introduced after assessing the outcome,” said Kazhakootam Cyber City assistant commissioner R Anilkumar.

Thiruvananthapuram: An Indo-German collaborative research proposal titled Genetic Architecture of Parkinson’s Disease in India, led by the comprehensive care centre for movement disorders in Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) and the Centre for Genetic Epidemiology, University of Tuebingen, Germany, has received a grant of $2.3 million from the Michel J Fox Foundation, USA.

The research was submitted by Dr Manu Sharma from the University of Tubingen, Germany, and Dr Asha Kishore, movement disorders specialist and director of SCTIMST. “This will be the first Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) on Parkinson’s disease (PD) in India and one of the largest GWAS conducted in the country,” said Dr Kishore.

GWAS in western population and east Asian regions have identified about 20 or more genetic variants as risk factors for Parkinson’s disease. As ethnically diverse populations vary in terms of the frequency of these variants in the population, it is necessary to conduct GWAS of Parkinson’s disease in India to capture the genetic variants that pose a risk for Parkinson’s disease among Indian patients under-represented in western studies, Dr Kishore added.

The aim of this research is to identify genetic risk factors of Parkinson’s disease in India through a GWAS. Approximately a half-million genetic markers will be assessed to identify the Indian Parkinson’s disease population-specific risk variants. To meet our objectives, more than 10,000 patients and 10,000 healthy controls will be recruited from across India to define a pan-Indian Parkinson’s disease map for the Indian population, she said.

A consortium of movement disorder specialists, neurologists and geneticists from 20 Indian centres are co-investigators in the multicentre international study along with the team in Germany led by Dr Sharma.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government recently approved new set of guidelines for declaring brain death of a patient.As per the new guidelines, the ventilator support of the patient can be removed by the medical team once the brain death is confirmed after tests without waiting for the consent from relatives.To declare a patient brain dead, a panel of doctors must perform prescribed tests twice with minimum interval of six hours. As per the new guidelines, medical practitioners should have a conversation with close relatives regarding the medical status and prognosis of the patient in whom brain stem death testing, including apnoea test, is being considered for confirmation of brain stem death diagnosis.The apnoea test should be the last brain stem reflex test to be performed and that too only if all other tests confirm the absence of other brain stem reflexes.All the prescribed tests are required to be performed twice to ensure that there has been no observer error and persistence of the clinical state can be documented with absolute degree of certainty. It is to be noted that the diagnosis is based on the clinical examination. After the completion of two consistent examinations by the medical experts panel, if criteria of brain stem death are met, the panel must declare the patient dead. “All treatments including cardiorespiratory support must be discontinued once brain stem death is pronounced,” says the new guidelines.Health minister pledges to donate organsTo promote organ donation, health minister K K Shailaja on Wednesday gave the consent for donating her organs after death.

Hence, he moved the high court Madurai bench to conduct indirect election for Rajapalayam panchayat union.

Similarly, in another petition, K Nirmala, a resident of Virudhunagar district, and a member of the DMK, said she was elected as ward 2 councillor of Sattur panchayat union in the district. She stated that since the DMK had a majority with eight councillors and its alliance party MDMK had two councillors of the total 16 councillors, the indirect election was postponed following the riot started by the ruling party members. Hence, she moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to conduct indirect election for Sattur panchayat union. When these petitions were heard on Wednesday, the state made the submissions.

Representational Image

AURANGABAD: The local crime branch of Jalna police has nabbed two suspects with criminal record for allegedly shooting Jalna trader Rajesh Nahar dead on the night of January 11.

Nahar was found with two bullet injuries in his car on the Partur-Vatur road, near Dambri village, in Jalna.

Raghuveer Singh Chandu Singh Tak and Arvind alias Badu Arjun Bhadarge, both from Partur and residing in MIDC Waluj area, were on Wednesday remanded in police custody for nine days by a local court.

Jalna superintendent of police S Chaitanya called the arrest a major breakthrough and said: “We are trying to find out the motive for the businessman’s murder and the person behind it.”

According to police, Nahar, was involved in cases for allegedly hiring contract killers to eliminate his rivals and even business partners.

Inspector Rajendersingh Gaur of the LCB said, “Raghuveer has 14 offences and Badu several cases registered against them. Most of the cases against them are property offences in different parts of the state.”

Police sources said that Nahar had disputes running into several crores of rupees in the market and that he had been arrested in a case. A video clip depicting the trader with alleged contract killers was recovered from him, said the sources.

Citing content of the clip, police said that Nahar was seen paying Rs 5 lakh out of the contract money of Rs 50 lakh for eliminating a private money lender from Jalna, with whom he had a monetary dispute.

Aurangabad: A 48-year-old man has been booked on charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust after he allegedly obtained a tractor on rent from a farmer and duped him of Rs 4.80 lakh.

According to police, the suspect is a special police officer (SPO) and he duped the farmer by claiming to be a retired police officer.

Former commissioner of police Yashasvi Yadav had introduced the concept of SPOs. The SPOs were given uniforms, whistle, baton and identity cards and were roped in with an aim to help city police with information and assistance in various tasks including maintenance of law and order situation.

Considering reports of some people with dubious track records making it to the list of SPOs, police had minimized taking their assistance, except in few cases.

As per complaint lodged by Ramesh Salve (50), a resident of Nagsennagar of Osmanpura, he met the 48-year-old suspect on January 23, 2019.

At the time of meeting, the suspect claimed to be an inspector who recently took voluntary retirement. The suspect sought the farmer’s tractor on rent.

Falling prey to the trap, the farmer handed over his tractor with registration number MH-20-AB-4116 against a rent of Rs 15, 000 per month. The complainant has stated that the suspect citing one or the other reason, not only failed to pay the promised rent on time for the past one year, but also failed to return the tractor.

Osmanpura police station inspector Dilip Tare said, “We have booked the suspect for cheating, criminal breach of trust, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy. Since the registration of offence, the suspect has gone underground and despite repeated attempts, he is untraceable.”

Representative image

MADURAI: An eatery owner is giving 10% discount on the bill for women who download the Kavalan app, introduced by the Tamil Nadu state police. He approaches women customers to create sensitization on the app and even helps them download and install it on their mobile phones.

S M Rajaprabu, 24, from Pattukottai in Thanjavur started the Madurai Meenakshi Mess at Ponmeni in June 2019.

“Although I knew about the app, Iexplored it only then. Every woman should have the app on her mobile phone so that she can press the distress button in times of emergency. Many women are not aware of the app. That’s when I thought of sensitizing them,” he said. Rajaprabu came up with the idea of introducing 10% discount, when his friend’s sister needed help to download the app.

Rajaprabu has so far approached more than 500 women customers and helped 200 of them to install the app on their phones.

Rajaprabu has completed diploma in hotel management and worked as a manager in an eatery in Chennai for a few years. When he wanted to start an eatery targeting bachelors and offices to offer traditional food, he chose Madurai. Only South Indian food is offered for lunch with an array of non-veg dishes and tiffin items are offered for dinner.

“I wanted to give a home like feeling for my customers and that’s why we do not have even a menu card. ‘Murattu Single’ is our flagship combo, where 21 items including non-veg, seafood, savouries, starters are offered at an affordable price of Rs 299,” he said.

He also popularizes reading habit among his customers and delivery boys, and has kept a bunch of books, which they can browse through until the food arrives.

201,['23/01/2020'],Saying CAA won’t be rolled back is dictatorship: Nath salvo from Davos,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Bhopal: Discussing India’s economic growth at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on Wednesday, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath termed as “dictatorship” remarks by home minister Amit Shah that the new citizenship law won’t be rolled back at any cost, irrespective of the protests. The buzz around India is subdued at the WEF this time, Nath said.

“Public is supreme in democracy. It is the responsibility of the government to obey public opinion. If people are on the streets in protest against CAA, then you should reconsider this law, discuss it with everyone. But you say that this law will not be rolled back in any circumstances; then, it is just dictatorship,” Nath said in Davos in reaction to Shah’s vow at a rally in UP on Tuesday that CAA “won’t be rolled back at any cost, irrespective of the protests”.

Nath sees this as “autocracy”, and remarked that anti-CAA protests have hurt Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image too. “The PM talks of cooperative federalism. But, states are not consulted before big decisions like CAA are rolled out. The youth of India are frustrated with PM Modi and this frustration will keep showing up in different ways. Nationwide CAA protests have hurt PM’s image,” the chief minister retweeted his statement after talking to reporters in Davos on Wednesday.

Nath, a regular at WEF for nearly 40 years, tweeted: “In all the decades that I have been coming to Davos for WEF, I have never seen the buzz around India so subdued. Everyone I meet is asking about the falling economy and growing social unrest. The central government is to blame for this mess.”

On January 13, Nath had questioned the need for the new citizenship law. “Is CAA necessary at a time when the country is facing an economic slowdown?” Nath had asked. “Is there a war going on? Are a large number of refugees seeking shelter in our country? CAA is only to divert the attention of public from crucial matters pertaining to economy, jobs and farm crisis. How long can BJP mislead people? There is an urgent need for improving our economic condition. PM Modi should talk about unemployment and farm crisis instead,” he had said.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A 42-year-old railway employee was run over by a train on Wednesday.

The accident took place near the coach factory attached to Kochuveli railway station near Karikkakom under Pettah police station limits.

Sajith S of SR Nivas, Mangalathu Nagarkavu, Chellamangalam, near Powdikonam is the deceased. He was a senior section engineer of the mechanical department at the wagon yard attached to Kochuveli railway station here.

According to police, the accident is suspected to have occurred around 6.30am.

Sajith was on night shift and his duty time ended at 6am. About 30 minutes later he was found dead on the track.

Eyewitnesses told police that Sajith was seen walking along the track while talking to someone over his mobile phone.

The police said that prima facie it appeared to be a case of accident. Meanwhile, chance of a suicide will also be probed as he may have jumped in front of the train after the call, they said.

The body of the deceased was handed over to the family after conducting postmortem. Sajith leaves behind wife Aswathy and a daughter.

Amit Shah, with MPs Meenakshi Lekhi and Manoj Tiwari, during a campaign in Lajpat Nagar earlier this month

NEW DELHI: With almost a fortnight to go before the February 8 elections for Delhi Assembly , BJP has planned a high-pitch campaign which will revolve around nationalism and Hindutva.

Senior party functionaries said that apart from talking about the “failures” of the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi, the campaigners will project the amended citizenship law, triple talaq, abrogation of Article 370 and 35A and the favourable ruling in the Ram temple case as achievements of the Narendra Modi-led central government in small group meetings across the city.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

“Opposition parties have been misleading people on the issue of Citizenship Amendment Act and inciting violence. We need to clear the air and expose them,” said a senior party functionary. “We have conducted several public meetings and door-to-door campaigns informing people about the features of the act and how it is not about taking away the citizenship of anyone in the country.”

“While other parties ran away from big challenges such as abrogation of Article 370, making triple talaq a criminal offence and the issue of Ram temple, it is BJP which delivered on what it promised. People must know and remember while casting their votes,” he added.

The party has planned over 5,000 group meetings, with about 200-500 people each, which would be addressed by top party leaders. On Thursday, Union home minister Amit Shah will begin the campaign by addressing two such meetings and participating in a padyatra in Matiala, Uttam Nagar and Nagloi Jat assembly segments.

Addressing a booth workers’ convention on January 5, Shah had mentioned that the party’s focus in Delhi polls would be on smaller corner meetings though there were a few public rallies, to be addressed by PM Narendra Modi, BJP national president JP Nadda and himself, closer to the election date.

On Wednesday, the party released a list of 40 star campaigners, including Modi, Shah, Nadda, several Union ministers, chief ministers of BJP-served states, Bollywood stars Hema Malini and Sunny Deol and Bhojpuri actors Ravi Kishan and Nirahua.

Rajya Sabha member Vijay Goel said some party leaders have also been asked to go to slum clusters and unauthorised colonies, stay overnight and have a discussion around a “bonfire” over a “cup of tea”. “We will tell them how the AAP government has failed to deliver on various promises and blocked Aayushman Bharat and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. But we will also tell them how opposition parties are defining the CAA in an incorrect manner and even inciting violence on the issue,” he said.

There will be campaigning outside metro stations, discussions in the metro, outreach programmes targeting various communities and roadshows and public rallies in the last leg of electioneering.

The party prepared a roadmap for the next 15 days at a closed-door meeting late on Tuesday evening. It was attended by all top leaders. “The message that the party leadership conveyed to everyone is that BJP is winning this election and it should be visible in the party’s campaign. It should be intense and direct and focus on the target groups,” said Delhi BJP general secretary Kuljeet Chahal.

NEW DELHI: BJP ’s Model Town candidate Kapil Mishra on Thursday compared the Delhi assembly elections with the India-Pakistan dichotomy , drawing strong reactions from Congress and AAP .The row erupted when Mishra, in a tweet, likened the February 8 poll contest with a “muqabla” between India and Pakistan. The former AAP functionary then backed up his comments while speaking to reporters, stating that several “mini-Pakistans” had been created in Delhi and that Shaheen Bagh was being replicated all over the capital.“People have occupied the streets at Shaheen Bagh. They are not allowing children to go to schools and adults to offices. They have refused to follow the Constitution and Parliament. Videos are emerging of children talking about the death of PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. The site has virtually turned into a mini-Pakistan. It is being backed by political parties,” Mishra said.He said such protests were causing a big inconvenience to the citizens.Mishra claimed that for political gains, parties were creating Shaheen Bagh-like protest centres. “In such a scenario, Hindustan will stand up against Pakistan and the assembly elections will be a contest between Hindustan and Pakistan,” Mishra said. “When other parties are openly supporting and creating mini-Pakistans, Hindustan cannot remain a silent spectator. The majority will not accept this...there will be a reaction to the action of the rioters who are against India,” he added.Mishra went on to call the women protesters anti-Indian. “Even those who attacked Parliament had tiranga on their cars. The youth of Jamia burned buses and were rioting. If BJP forms the government (in Delhi), we will arrest the tukde-tukde gang in 24 hours.”AAP’s Sanjay Singh dismissed the comments by asking “who is Kapil Mishra”. Congress functionary Mukesh Sharma said the BJP candidate’s remarks were an attempt to polarise opinion. “On February 8, people will decide whether they want jobs or unemployment. BJP is resorting to new tricks to divide people after CAA failed to do so. Its attempts towards polarisation will not work in Delhi.”Mishra, meanwhile, also targeted AAP over its development pitch. “We (BJP candidates) are explaining to the people in clear terms that Delhi did not witness any development in the last five years. No flyover was constructed, no new hospital or school was opened.

Thiruvananthapuram: A showroom of a prominent footwear brand, Bata, at Karamana was partially gutted in a fire that broke out in the three-storeyed building in which the showroom functioned.

The fumes were spotted when the manager of the showroom turned up in the morning to open the shop.

According to fire department officials, they received a call alerting them about the fire at 9.35am on Wednesday. The caller said that thick fumes were billowing out of the second floor of the building.

Three units of fire-fighters from the Thiruvananthapuram fire station rushed to the spot. The entire operation lasted just over 90 minutes. “Our priority after reaching the spot was to identify the source of the fire and then create a firebreak by removing combustible materials from the reach of the flames, thereby preventing it from spreading,” said Thiruvananthapuram fire station officer G Suresh Kumar. While one team of fire-fighters climbed to the second floor of the building to fight the fire, the others entered the other two floors and started removing all the goods inside. This strategy helped them keep the damages at minimum.

The fire broke out in the portion of the second floor of the building that was used as a storeroom. The shop authorities have not yet assessed the actual worth of the loss incurred. However, the fire department officials estimate that a loss of at least Rs 10 lakh has been incurred.

Officials said that the building did not have modern firefighting mechanisms . Though it is assumed that a short circuit may be the reason for the fire, the cause can be confirmed only after further examinations. tnn

207,['23/01/2020'],Pazhampori... back in IRCTC menu but at double the price,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Kochi: The railways has put appam, puttu, egg curry, pazhampori and several other favourite food items of Keralites back on its regional menu, but has also doubled the prices in the bargain.

‘Meals’ will now cost Rs 75, up from Rs 35, while a snack which came at a modest Rs 8 will now cost Rs 15.

On Tuesday, after an incensed social media vented its ire over the decision of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) to drop several Kerala snacks and food items, the corporation has brought out a new menu which shows that they have been reinstated. As a bonus IRCTC has included an option of fish curry along with the meals.

“I welcome @IRCTCofficial decision to withdraw earlier decision to exclude Kerala delicacies from railway menu. It was the sentiment of Kerala that I echoed to chairman M P Mall. IRCTC officials visited me today and handed over the reinstated menu. We got fish curry meals as a bonus!,” tweeted Ernakulam MP Hibi Eden on Wednesday. Eden had taken up the issue by sending a letter to Union minister of railways Piyush Goyal and IRCTC chairman M P Mall.

Flaying the decision to drop items like appam & egg curry, porotta, puttu, pazhampori, elayada, Kozhukkata, unniyappam, neyyappam and sukhiyan from the railways menu, a handle by the name @Advaidism tweeted: “Malayalis don’t eat rajma chawal, chhole bhature, pav bhaji & khichdi. Even south Indians don’t eat it. First they came for our language, now they’re coming for our food. Cultural fascism at your door steps,” the tweet read.

IRCTC tweeted from its official handle on Tuesday that “in view of the demand from passengers and representations received, IRCTC has fully authorized it’s local offices in zones and regions to bring more items as per the local taste and regional preferences within one week as snack meals.” It also informed that all food items served earlier will be restored. “Some of these snacks were missing though they were in the menu since people who had the contract did not have people who knew how to make them. But I think this happened because IRCTC standardized the menu without giving much thought about attachment Keralites have towards these snacks,” said Krishnakumar P, secretary, Thrissur railway passengers association.

Eden said though they have revised the menu, IRCTC has not responded to the request to bring down the price. “They presented me with a revised menu on Wednesday morning and said an order reinstating the list of snacks that were excluded will be issued soon,” Eden said.

The RSS workers plan to hold over 40,000 drawing room meetings before the February 8 polls

NEW DELHI: A fortnight before Delhi votes in the assembly election, an army of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh workers has descended on the city. They plan to hold over 40,000 drawing room meetings before the February 8 polls and discuss subjects like Shaheen Bagh and Jamia protests , Citizenship Amendment Act , National Register of Citizens and Ram Mandir .

RSS expects each meeting to attract 15-20 people, who will be asked to stand with the “nationalist forces” in the “test of polarisation”. On the radar are youth, women, socially influential individuals, working class people and Dalits.

The campaigning for assembly polls has already entered the final phase. Having announced their candidates, Aam Aadmi Party, Congress and BJP leaders have hit the ground with roadshows, corner meetings, door-to-door campaigns and publicity blitz on social media.

The intervention of the RSS army in the all-consuming electioneering has immense significance for BJP. Unlike general elections, assembly polls are fought on local issues, but with Delhi the epicentre of the CAA-NRC protests, the citizenship issue has taken over political and public discourse in recent weeks. The sit-in at Shaheen Bagh, over a month-long now, is being widely discussed among the masses. BJP candidate from Model Town Kapil Mishra has been pushing for an end to the Shaheen Bagh protests , while other saffron leaders have castigated AAP and Congress for “backing” the agitators.

An RSS functionary maintained that Delhiites were against the protesters because the new law would grant citizenship to persecuted minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. “Vested interests are supporting the CAA protests in Delhi. We are informing aware citizens that people are being inconvenience by other parties purely for vote-bank benefits,” the functionary said.

A 12-point pamphlet will be distributed to 25 lakh households in the capital. It talks about the abolition of triple talaq, construction of National War Memorial, development of Panchteerth in honour of BR Ambedkar, Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, CAA, 10% reservation in government jobs and educational institutions for the economically weaker sections and the regularisation of 1,731 illegal colonies in Delhi.

The pamphlet also offers the saffron view on the Jamia violence, the alleged hate speech by an MLA (the pamphlet does not name any political party or legislator), the delay in sanction of prosecution in the JNU sedition case, etc. “Vote thoughtfully to push forward the speed of development in Delhi and to stop the conspiring forces from breaking the nation,” the pamphlet urges. While asking for a 100% voters’ turnout, the paper asks people to keep in mind these issues when they reach the polling booths.

RSS has an extensive network of workers in almost all colonies of Delhi and they will be used for the awareness exercise. RSS Delhi unit spokesperson Rajeev Tuli, however, explained that the outreach workers will avoid discussing issues pertaining to the city because that is the job of BJP. The awareness exercise is likely to energise BJP’s campaign as the party attempts to dislodge AAP and return to power in Delhi after 27 years.

It talks about the abolition of triple talaq, construction of National War Memorial, development of Panchteerth in honour of BR Ambedkar, Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, CAA, 10% reservation in government jobs and educational institutions for the economically weaker sections and the regularisation of 1,731 illegal colonies in Delhi.The pamphlet also offers the saffron view on the Jamia violence, the alleged hate speech by an MLA (the pamphlet does not name any political party or legislator), the delay in sanction of prosecution in the JNU sedition case, etc. “Vote thoughtfully to push forward the speed of development in Delhi and to stop the conspiring forces from breaking the nation,” the pamphlet urges. While asking for a 100% voters’ turnout, the paper asks people to keep in mind these issues when they reach the polling booths.RSS has an extensive network of workers in almost all colonies of Delhi and they will be used for the awareness exercise. RSS Delhi unit spokesperson Rajeev Tuli, however, explained that the outreach workers will avoid discussing issues pertaining to the city because that is the job of BJP. The awareness exercise is likely to energise BJP’s campaign as the party attempts to dislodge AAP and return to power in Delhi after 27 years.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73536045,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-295760,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/rss-to-throw-its-weight-behind-bjp-campaign/articleshow/73538078.cms

Counterfeit currency with a face value of Rs 3.6 lakh has been seized

KOLKATA: With the use and demand for currency of Rs 2,000 denomination coming down, those making fake notes have also shifted gears. The Special Task Force of Kolkata Police has busted a gang that makes counterfeit notes of Rs 500 denomination only.

“In one consignment, we found all the fake notes to be of Rs 500 denomination. In Kolkata, this is a first since demonetization,” said a senior investigating officer at Lalbazar.

The anti-FICN team of the Kolkata Police had a tio-off that some of the gang members would assemble near Shahid Minar at Esplanade. Accordingly, they laid a trap and caught two from the gang around 6pm on January 21. On search, the cops seized 692 fake notes, with a face value of Rs 3.6 lakh from the two. The accused have been identified as Senaul Sk alias Sanaul (34) and Akramul (43), both residents of Kaliachak in Malda. “One of the accused had got a secret pocket stitched to his sweater to carry the counterfeit currency. He was planning to distribute these fake notes in trading hubs in the state,” said an IPS officer. Like earlier, these notes, too, carried Bangladeshi watermarks.

“With the RBI regulating the flow of Rs 2,000 in the market, the counterfeiters have gone back to making fake Rs 500 notes, their forte before demonetization,” claimed a senior officer.

BHUBANESWAR: Buoyed by a strong passenger sentiment and increasing flight movements, Odisha is eyeing newer destinations. On Wednesday, chief minister Naveen Patnaik chaired a meeting with chief executives of different airlines and officers of state government and civil aviation ministry during which a plan was unveiled to operate 14 flights to about five international destinations and three new places on the domestic map.

Abu Dhabi, Singapore, Bangkok, Sri Lanka and Dubai are the international destinations that the state has set its eyes on. On the home front, Kolkata-Jharsuguda, Bhubaneswar-Varanasi, Jharsuguda-Mumbai, Prayagraj-Bhubaneswar, Bhubaneswar-Rourkela and Bhubaneswar-Kalaikunda are the new destinations being planned.

At present, only the flight to Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur is operational from the Biju Patnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar. The one to Bangkok has been suspended for now. At the domestic level, flights from Bhubaneswar airport reach Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Guwahati, Mumbai and Surat.

The city airport has witnessed 38 lakh passengers by the end of 2018-19 fiscal, 8 lakh more than the previous financial year. Besides, the number of aircraft movements has gone up from 58,000 in 2017-18 to 63,000 in 2018-19.

Talking about the Odisha growth story, Naveen urged the Centre and the airlines to improve air connectivity from Odisha to domestic and international destinations.

“I take this opportunity to thank the ministry of civil aviation for increased connectivity to Odisha. I further request the ministry to introduce new connectivity from Odisha to domestic destinations like Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow, Chennai, Vizag, Kochi and Ranchi. Similar is the demand for potential international hubs like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, Hong Kong, Bangkok and Colombo. I assure that the state government will provide necessary support,” Naveen said at the meeting.

The government has said it will offer 1 per cent VAT on air turbine fuel for international flights . “In the last few years, the aviation traffic in Odisha has witnessed a vertical ride. Though domestic flight connectivity has seen noticeable improvement, there is greater scope for international connectivity,” Naveen said highlighting the fact that a sizeable number of techno-savvy Odias is active in countries like the USA and Australia besides European and South-east Asian countries.

Besides, a substantial Odia population is also working in the Gulf countries. “I strongly believe that our ‘skilled in Odisha’ module has strengthened Brand Odisha, making our professionals high in demand in many countries across the globe,” Naveen added.

Chief secretary Asit Tripathy, civil aviation secretary P S Kharola, transport minister Padmanav Behera, civil aviation joint secretary Usha Padhi, transport secretary Pramod Meherda and industry secretary Vishal Dev were present at the meeting, which was attended by 25 CEOs of different airlines. Representatives from AirAsia, Etihad, SilkAir, IndiGo and SpiceJet were among those who attended the meeting.

TRICHY: Former state minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE), V V Swaminathan, on Wednesday, said that it would be a betrayal of Tamil if the proposed consecration at Big Temple is not conducted in the language.

Addressing a conference in Thanjavur , Swaminathan urged the state government to conduct the consecration ceremony at Big Temple in Tamil, which is scheduled to be held on February 5.

“Consecration must be performed only in Tamil language. It is shameful and a betrayal of Tamil if the state government fails to take necessary steps to conduct the ceremony in Tamil,” he added.

Swaminathan also demanded that the state government establish the statue of King Raja Raja Cholan on Chennai’s Marina beach. The whereabouts of the king's tomb is also a mystery, he said and added that the government should do the needful to find an answer to the question.

While talking about the stolen statues of King Raja Raja Cholan and his wife Logamadevi, Swaminathan said though the statues were brought back by the idol wing police to India, they are yet to be reinstalled at the temple. There was a connection between the staff of the temple and the thieves who stole the idols earlier, he alleged.

Various resolutions have been adopted at the conference including pressurizing the government with regard to consecration in Tamil. Another resolution urged the government to take over the control of the temple from the trustee of Thanjavur Palace Devasthanam and senior prince Babaji Rajah Bhonsle.

Earlier in the morning, puja was conducted at a marriage hall in Thanjavur by Hindu Vedha Marumalarchi Iyakkam headed by its president T Ponnuswami , in which Kudanthai Irai Neri Imayavan, Thanjai Periya Kovil Urimai Meetpukuzhu president C Murugesan and its organizer P Maniarasan participated.

213,['23/01/2020'],Delhi assembly elections: Parties tap into doubts over drinking water to quench their thirst for votes,"Aam Aadmi Party has promised 24-hours availability of tapped drinking water in all houses

NEW DELHI: At a JJ cluster in south Delhi’s Kalkaji Extension, Adhir Chand Rai surveyed the dismal sprawl of Bhoomiheen Camp and sighed, “Before every election, I have heard many promises being made.”One thing, however, has impressed the 79-year-old. “The water situation has improved in the last two years. Supply lines that terminated at DDA flats have been extended to our homes,” he said. What is more, with their limited consumption, the hutment dwellers invariably end up paying nothing for water.In the 2013 assembly elections campaign, the newly started Aam Aadmi Party had promised bijli half, paani maaf — halved power bills and free water up to 20,000 litres a month. The scheme came into force on January 1, 2014, and data for the last billing cycle (November — December 2019) proved that 60% of Delhi’s households received zero bills for water.In a water-stressed city with a demand-supply gap of around 300 million gallons a day, political parties seek to turn water into votes. If AAP is tom-tomming its free water scheme and the expansion of water-supply infrastructure in unauthorised colonies and JJ clusters, no less than PM Narendra Modi described water quality as the capital’s biggest problem at an election rally at Ramlila Maidan last month, citing the increasing sale of water purifiers to support his argument.Delhi Jal Board vice-chairman Dinesh Mohaniya, for his part, quickly disproved a BIS survey showing poor results for some tap water samples from the city with its own tests that returned conclusions showing 98.2% of the 4,204 samples assessed had passed the quality benchmarks. He insisted that water being supplied in Delhi more than adequately met World Health Organization norms of 5% sample failure rate. The entire water purifier industry was founded on spreading doubts about water quality, he alleged.The reality perhaps lies somewhere between these two extremes. As Jasbir Chadda of URJA, a collective of city RWAs, observed, while supply network had reached unauthorised colonies, the distribution pipelines in planned areas were 40-50 years old. “AAP needs to focus on distribution of normal quality water 24x7. Water is a matter of trust. People must be confident of DJB’s capability to supply water drinkable straight from the tap.”Yogender Pandit, a security guard who lives in Surat Vihar near Bhalswa lake, says that water lines were laid in his area around a decade back, but water quality deteriorated after a coupleof years. “We get brackish water that can’t be used for drinking. That is why there are many water plants in Burari,” said Pandit.DJB has undertaken unprecedented infrastructure expansion in the past five years and piped water coverage has gone up from 54% to 89% of the households. Supply lines have been taken to 618 new colonies, sewer lines to 154. Water production has increased 14% and sewage treatment 21%. The addition of over six lakh active meters has boosted DJB’s revenue from Rs 1,219 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 1,819 crore in 2019, though the capital intensive infra development put the books under pressure.“When you can’t check losses, how will you replace broken pipelines?” asked Manoj Tiwari, the BJP’s Delhi president, citing figures from the answers to an RTI query. In its 2018 response, DJB had put its deficit for 2018-19 at Rs 663.6 crore. In 2008-09, the water utility had logged a surplus of Rs 61.9 crore, which increased to Rs 227.8 crore the following year. Mohaniya explained the losses as primarily due to infrastructure expansions and a higher salary burden after the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations.DJB also came up with plans to augment water resources, with the focus being on developing and conserving water bodies. Besides launching the Palla riverbed water storage project, the revival of 201 waterbodies has been announced, 155 to be undertaken by DJB. Pilot projects at Rajokri Lake and Gogha drain proved successful. However, cleaning the Yamuna from Wazirabad drain onward remains a work in progress.Jyoti Sharma, founder and head of FORCE, an organisation involved with water and sanitation issues, expressed happiness at Delhi moving in the right direction with improved access to drinking water and innovative approaches to water conservation. “The focus now should be on end-user water quality and water-use efficiency,” she said.Ahead of the February 8 polls, Aam Aadmi Party has promised 24-hours availability of tapped drinking water in all houses, while Congress has assured of not only the continuation of the 20,000 litre scheme but also an additional 30 paise cashback on each litre of water saved by a household. BJP is leveraging the Centre’s National Drinking Water Mission to woo votes with the promise of piped water to Delhi homes.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73538905,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-178370,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/parties-tap-into-doubts-over-drinking-water-to-quench-their-thirst-for-votes/articleshow/73539507.cms

TRICHY: While school education department has instructed state board schools to verify community certificates of Class V and VIII students who will be appearing for board examination this year, some of the schools are unable to verify the details .

With Saturday fixed as the last date to update the details by the teachers in Education Management Information System (EMIS), a centralized database of students, many of the parents have still not obtained a community certificate for their children who are in class V.

“Mostly students belonging to scheduled caste community obtain the certificate at an early stage as they are entitled to scholarship. However, students from backward class community will only furnish the community certificate when they come to Class X. Though the students give the details of their community, it is verified before preparing a nominal role,” said a government school headmaster from Trichy. As students of Class V and VIII will be appearing for state board examination from this year, teachers have been asked to update the details before Saturday to update details of students in EMIS.

Tamil Nadu Aasiryar Munnetra Sangam, K Uduman Ali said that parents could have been given some more time to get the community certificate. Many of the parents have applied for a community certificate and it is highly unlikely to get it before Saturday.

A block education officer from Trichy district said that it isn’t mandatory for all the parents to furnish the community certificate as details of their wards had been already fed in EMIS at the time of their admission. Their credentials will be used in board examination certificates. Since it will be used for further communication, parents are asked to verify the details, said the official.

AURANGABAD: The crime branch of the city police, while searching for a chain-snatcher, ended up detecting another case involving a gold valuer who allegedly passed other metals as gold for obtaining loan against them.

Police have arrested Sharad Jagannath Shahane (35), the gold valuer, and his younger brother Sachin (32) — both residents of Balaji Nagar.

Crime branch inspector Madhukar Sawant said, “We were looking for Satish Baburao Naik (27), who already has a record of being involved in chain-snatching cases. After tracking him down, he revealed that one of his friends has obtained two gold loans on his name by submitting gold-plated ornaments.”

Upon cross-verifying the claims made by Naik, the crime branch team went to Jana Small Finance Bank in Garkheda. The bank roped in another gold valuer who carried out the valuation of the metals deposited and found that duplicate gold ornaments were deposited in the bank for obtaining loan.

However, as the bank was taking longer than usual to take a call about lodging a complaint, Naik lodged a complaint with Jawaharnagar police following which the accused were booked on charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust.

As per complaint lodged by Naik, few months ago one of his friends contacted him with a request to help him obtain loan against gold. Naik, who was reluctant in opening the gold loan account in his name, somehow agreed after his friend claimed that he did not have the required documents. The suspect even offered to give a portion of money to Naik from the money obtained from the bank.

Accordingly, the suspect brought some gold-plated ornaments and on October 25, 2019 reached out to the bank, where his friend’s elder brother worked as gold valuer. The metal was passed off as gold and against it they obtained loan of Rs 1 lakh.

Days later, the suspect contacted him again and obtained another loan of Rs 2 lakh. On both occasions, the suspect did not give Naik the money promised from the loan amount.

Crime branch inspector said preliminary probe revealed that the suspect provides his services as valuer to several banks in the city and using similar modus operandi, he is suspected of obtaining loans from different banks.

TRICHY: A 50-year-old man, who was the prime accused in the double murder of a man and his son, was hacked to death by a six-member gang near Keeranur in Pudukottai district on Wednesday morning.

The murdered man has been identified as A Murthy, a former panchayat union councillor. Murthy, who was on his morning walk, was hacked to death by six men who came on three motorcycles.

Police said Murthy was the prime accused in the murders of Veerasamy of Kalamavur and his son, Muthu, over a property dispute.

Police said that Veerasamy and Muthu had struck a deal for Rs 1.25 crore to purchase a farmhouse owned by Murthy last year. According to police, Murthy had received the money but refused to vacant the farmhouse. Due to this, the dispute aggravated, and Murthy decided to eliminate the father-son duo.

A 12-member gang, hired by Murthy, hacked the father and the son to death in February last year. Further, the attack also left Veerasamy’s relatives Jeyaraman and his son Sivasangu, with brutal injuries.

Police had arrested 18 people, including Murthy in connection with the murders. While he managed to get bail a few months back, he was maintaining a low profile at his home in Keeranur.

Police said Murthy could have been murdered to avenge the murders of the father-son duo.

Pudukottai district superintendent of police Arun Sakthi Kumar constituted four teams to nab the gang.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has “limited options” to respond to India’s decision to abrogate Article 370 on Jammu & Kashmir and can only hope to gain from “self-inflicted” damage caused by New Delhi’s policies in Kashmir and on the citizenship law, US Congress’s research arm, the Congressional Research Service , has said.

“Given also that Pakistan and its primary ally, China, enjoy limited international credibility on human rights issues, Islamabad may stand by and hope that self-inflicted damage caused by New Delhi's own policies in Kashmir and, more recently, on citizenship laws, will harm India’s reputation and perhaps undercut its recent diplomatic gains with Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE,” the CRS said.

In a new report, the CRS said Pakistan’s diplomatic isolation as well as its “reduced” capability to alter the status quo in J&K through military means limited its options.

“Many analysts view Islamabad as having little credibility on Kashmir, given its long history of covertly supporting militant groups there. Pakistan’s leadership has limited options to respond to India’s actions, and renewed Pakistani support for Kashmiri militancy likely would be costly internationally. Pakistan’s ability to alter the status quo through military action has been reduced in recent years, meaning that Islamabad likely must rely primarily on diplomacy,” the CRS said, noting that Pakistan appeared diplomatically isolated on the Kashmir issue and had only Turkey as its explicit ally.

The CRS said following India’s August 2019 actions, numerous members of the US Congress went on record in support of Kashmiri human rights. A House resolution introduced in December and currently with 40 co-sponsors, urged the Indian government to end the restrictions on communications in J&K, it said.

“Yet, any US impulse to tilt toward India is to some extent offset by Islamabad's current, and by most accounts vital, role in facilitating Afghan reconciliation negotiations. President Donald Trump's apparent bonhomie with Pakistan's prime minister and offer to mediate on Kashmir in July was taken by some as a new and potentially unwise strategic shift,” it said.

Pakistan has been working hard to bring diplomatic pressure on India, including though China. China has called for a special discussion on Kashmir three times in the past six months. On August 16, the UNSC met for the first time in decades to discuss Kashmir.

221,['23/01/2020'],Ranchi congestion forced flight diversion: Airline,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Kolkata: A day after an AirAsia India flight (I5-545) from Delhi to Ranchi had made a fuel SOS diversion to Kolkata, the airline claimed that the captain’s decision was forced by a congestion .

The airport operator, however, denied the airline's claim, saying the exigency had possibly occurred because the flight was carrying less fuel. The flight departed with requisite fuel and an additional padding. On reaching Ranchi, there was a congestion and the landing was kept on hold. By the time the aircraft could make an approach, the additional fuel reduced to a great extent and the crew had to divert it to Kolkata as per the policy laid down by the company. The aircraft landed in the city and after refuelling, it returned to Ranchi. We reiterate that we gave importance to safety and security in all aspects of operations and apologise for the inconvenience caused to passengers,” said an airline spokesperson.

Ranchi airport director, Vinod Kumar Sharma, said it was not unusual for planes to queue up for landing and carry holding fuel. “A queue of planes arriving to land is routine. The diversion took place because the pilot felt he was running on low fuel ,” said Sharma. Officials at Ranchi airport said this was not the first time that flights to the airport had been diverted to Kolkata. This has made it to the headline simply because the pilot declared the plane was low on fuel. “The diversion happens because planes do not carry enough holding fuel to wait in queue,” said an official at Ranchi ATC, adding that the practice was fuelled by the incentive to purchase aviation turbine fuel at Ranchi, where the price was substantially lower than other airports.

“Picking up fuel from Ranchi leads to substantial saving in operational costs. But at times, it poses a safety risk,” said another official.

An ATC official said the flight would have touched down 18 minutes after it chose to go to Kolkata. “The Air India flight had already been cleared to land ahead of the AirAsia aircraft . It would have touched down in 9 minutes and the AirAsia flight, further 9 minutes later,” he said. In fact, on Tuesday, there were two more planes behind AirAsia and they landed in Ranchi without the need for a refuelling stop elsewhere.

222,['23/01/2020'],CCP yet to release seized food carts,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Panaji: Fourteen food carts selling ros omlette and Chinese food in the paved area near Don Bosco School in Panaji seized for dumping waste directly in the drains, are yet to be released by the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP), and are not likely to be allowed to operate there again, Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar said at a CCP meeting last week.

“The food carts continue to remain confiscated by us. We need to rethink their location and decide how many can be relocated. They will be released on payment of a fine,” CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues told TOI.

The carts operated throughout the night,cooking at site but not cleaning up after. The corporation found chicken bones and food waste dumped in the drains, emanating a stench. The mayor has threatened to cancel their licenses, reasoning that people’s health was at stake. “The operators were carrying out their business by inconveniencing others,” Madkaikar said, attributing the flooding in the area to the cart operators clogging the drains.

The issue was raised at the CCP meeting last week by corporator Soraya Pinto Makhija, who suggested the carts be relocated to Patto plaza, where offices shut by 6.30pm and there is ample parking. At the meeting, Madkaikar said the food carts would not be moved back there and that a meeting of the town vending committee would be called to discuss the matter.

The corporation has received several complaints from the school and residents of the neighbourhood.

Sitting on a chair affixed on a jeep, the CM waved to the crowd on the streets of Bhalswa Dairy and Swaroop Nagar as the first of his second round of roadshows kicked off.Donning a cap with the party’s name and symbol, Kejriwal sported a red sweater and his trademark muffler as he lent his voice to the campaigns of AAP candidates for Badli and Adarsh Nagar, Ajesh Yadav and Pawan Sharma, respectively.Though the CM rarely got down from the jeep during the nearly two-hour roadshow, he readily accepted colourful turbans and stoles offered by the villagers and put them on. He also shook hands with a few senior citizens. Amid tight security, the roadshow began from Som Bazar Road in Swaroop Nagar. Party supporters sang AAP’s election campaign song, Lage raho Kejriwal, and distributed pamphlets to the residents.As the cavalcade chugged towards Bhalswa Dairy Road, its speed automatically slowed due to uneven roads, overflowing drains and silt or garbage lying at various places. A resident claimed that a part of the silt was removed only the previous night in anticipation of the rally.“The roads haven’t been carpeted for years and it’s nearly impossible to walk here after it rains. But at least AAP has provided relief to us poor people in form of water and electricity bill waivers.

At the same time, he said AAP government’s schemes for the poor and the CM’s “low profile” were undeniable factors. “He (Kejriwal) was the one who continuously fought for a legal tag for the unauthorised colonies.

NGT

CHENNAI: Construction of a compost yard, which was stopped following opposition from locals in Poothapedu near Valasaravakkam , may not resume anytime soon.

The National Green Tribunal ( NGT ), Southern Zone, has directed the Greater Chennai Corporation to submit a report on how it handles waste at present before taking a call in the issue. The civic body had planned to build a compost yard on School Street in Poothapedu to dispose biodegradable waste. However, local residents, particularly those living in nearby apartments, opposed it saying they were using the land as a park and if the corporation dumps waste in an unhygienic manner, it would affect the surroundings causing health hazards. No proper site inspection was conducted before identifying the area, surrounded by schools and religious places, for this purpose and it’s in violation of the Municipal Waste Management Rules, residents alleged.

So, they approached the NGT seeking directions to remove construction carried out so far and permanently stop further efforts to commence operation of a compost yard or any other waste processing facility at Poothapedu.

The corporation, in response, argued that work at Poothapedu was stopped in 2018 following opposition from the locals. But the facility, aimed at decomposing organic waste using aerobic method and later converting it to manure in public interest, won’t cause any pollution or have any detrimental effect on the environment.

Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) inspected the place and confirmed that no construction happened there after 2018. However, TNPCB pointed out that the corporation hasn’t filed any application for obtaining its consent to operate such a facility as mandated by local laws.

Counsel for the government argued that the case was also heard by the Madras high court. There was nothing wrong is using a portion of the park for establishing a compost yard, the court ruled. Local authorities were told to ensure that no nuisance was caused to residents and the facility premises was cleaned twice a day to avoid mosquitoes.

On hearing the case, NGT members Justice K Ramakrishnan and Saibal Dasgupta directed the corporation to submit a report on present waste management strategies and whether legacy waste was dumped in that area. The matter will be heard again on February 17.

226,['23/01/2020'],Artha Tatwa group chief Pradeep Sethy attempts suicide in Jharpada jail,"This story is from January 23, 2020

BHUBANESWAR: Chief managing director of Artha Tatwa (AT) Group Pradeep Sethy allegedly attempted suicide in Jharpada special jail here on Tuesday.

Jail superintendent (Jharpada) Subhakant Mishra said, “Sethy tried to strangulate himself by using an electrical wire inside the jail toilet on Tuesday afternoon.” The prison’s directorate has started an investigation into the case.

The news of Sethy’s second suicide bid surfaced only after he was shifted to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack on Wednesday. Sethy had made the first attempt in 2016, blaming poor medical facilities and sluggish trial of his cases.

The AT Group chief is serving a seven-year jail term for his involvement in two separate cheating cases and still faces trial in connection with a few more cases.

The jail authorities blamed Sethy’s alleged mental condition for such an attempt. Mishra said, “Sethy has been undergoing treatment for a mental health condition over the past few years. On Tuesday, he had an altercation with a clerk inside the jail. Once it was over, Sethy snapped a wire from the inverter in the welfare section and ran with it to the toilet. Though security personnel chased him, he locked himself in.”

Mishra added, “The jail guards broke open the door of the toilet and rescued Sethy. He was found strangulating himself with the help of the wire.” Mishra further said Sethy did not have any injury mark on his body and was referred to the psychiatric ward (mental health institute) at SCB.

The jail authorities informed that Sethy had a few violent episodes in the last few months and was kept under vigil. He was lodged in cell no. 6 along with other undertrial prisoners.

The SCB doctors said they were examining Sethy’s mental health. “We will conduct certain tests on him. His condition is stable now,” a doctor said.

AT Group has been accused of duping investors of more than Rs 500 crore in the state. Police said Sethy completed his PhD in Botany from Karnataka University and pursued higher studies in Malaysia. Sethy transformed his company to a Rs 350-crore business empire between 2009 and 2012, they added.

He then floated nine other sister concerns and diversified his business into real estate, shares and investment and restaurant, among others. Sethy was arrested by Kharavel Nagar police here in May 2013.

Tukaram Mundhe

NAGPUR: The state government on Tuesday replaced Abhijit Bangar with Tukaram Mundhe as the municipal commissioner.

Bangar’s transfer comes as a surprise because he completed only 14 months in office despite having a minimum tenure of 36 months.

Additional chief secretary (GAD) Sitaram Kunte issued a letter to Mundhe, directing him to hand over his existing charge of project director, Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society, Pune, to another officer and take charge as municipal commissioner of the NMC with immediate effect.

Surprisingly, the government did not issue any letter to Bangar regarding his new posting.

The government has upgraded the post of municipal commissioner as Mundhe is an IAS officer of 2005 batch while Bangar belongs to the 2008 batch. Bangar assumed charge at NMC on November 14, 2018.

Mundhe has been transferred thirteen times in his 15-year career. He was transferred from Nashik Municipal Corporation in November 2018 after the general body passed a no confidence motion against him.

Mayor Sandip Joshi said Bangar did a commendable job with the highlight being improving the rank of the city in Swachh Survekshan. “I hope the NMC administration will improve its speed and efficiency under Mundhe. Everybody will have to ensure further development of the city and provide basic amenities to citizens,” he said.

Rumours of Bangar’s replacement with Mundhe started with Maha Vikas Aghadi forming the government in the state. Talk of the Sena-Congress-NCP-led government planning to take control of the BJP-led NMC by appointing Mundhe as the civic chief was doing the rounds.

Bangar tackled major issues like the worst-ever water crisis, appointment of new garbage operators, improvement of the city bus service, speeding up of the Smart City project, rejection of the proposed road from Bharat Van, acquisition of land for Metro Rail , cement roads and control over avoidable expense by curtailing the budget by 25%.

PANAJI: Sixteen contract staff, including junior civil and IT engineers, assistant accountants and lower divisional clerks working for the Corporation of the City of Panaji(CCP) are yet to receive their salaries for the month of December.

In December , staff salaries are usually released in advance. The employee contracts of the staff working in the technical, accounts, IT, administration and solid waste sections expired in October.

Mayor Uday Madkaikar said a decision is taken every six months at the standing committee meeting to renew the contracts. At the last standing committee meeting, the decision was not taken, he said, adding that this would be done at the next meeting, following which salaries will be released.

“We will review the performances of the contract staff and decide whether to renew their contracts or not,"" he told TOI.

Former mayor Surendra Furtado raised the issue of non-payment of salaries for the month of December at the corporation meeting held last week, saying the non-release of salaries could affect the functioning of the civic body.

On the other hand, corporator Ruth Furtado raised the issue of CCP hiring staff without the mandatory approval of the director of municipal administration, (DMA) and without advertising the posts.

Sources say the salaries of the contract workers haven’t been released as the accounts department refused to release the salaries of the new staff, as they were appointed without any advertisement.

CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues attributed the delay in the release of salaries to administrative issues. “The renewal is pending with the government administration. There is nothing stopping the payment of salaries,” he told TOI.

BHUBANESWAR: The special task force (STF) of the crime branch has started a probe into the operations of interstate gangs that make fake Aadhaar cards. The probe began after the STF rescued six sex workers suspected to be from Bangladesh here on Tuesday and found them possessed of fake Aadhaar cards.

“The addresses mentioned on the cards were in Kolkata. We have requested Kolkata Police and Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to ascertain the authenticity of the cards seized from the six women. Our larger goal is to dismantle the networks that create fake Aadhaar cards,” STF’s deputy inspector-general Jay Narayan Pankaj told TOI.

Sources in the STF said the six women, all in their twenties and thirties, had admitted to the probe agency that they had been trafficked from Bangladesh and engaged in prostitution in Bhubaneswar. They were rescued from Old Town area on Tuesday, hours after the STF arrested a couple from Pipili in Puri district for allegedly forcing them into sex trade.

The STF is also planning to seek the assistance of the ministry of home affairs (MHA) to prevent the unauthorized entry of Bangladeshi nationals to Odisha via road and sea routes. “We are planning to draw the attention of the Border Security Force (BSF) as most Bangladeshi nationals illegally enter India by road. The six women who have been rehabilitated in a short stay home here are being asked to identify those who helped them enter India and get fake Aadhaar cards,” an STF officer said.

TRICHY: A Trichy court on Wednesday convicted three people to life imprisonment for murdering a man after a dispute over monetary transactions done 11 years ago at Sangiliyandapuram here. The additional district court III awarded life imprisonment to Feroz Ahamed, 46, Pandikumar, 49, and Francis Prabhu, 49, and imposed a fine of Rs 1,000 each on them for murdering M Shahul Hameed, 40, of Dhanarathinam Nagar near Gandhi market.

The court also sentenced them to three more years of imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 500 on each of them for causing disappearance of evidence. Prime accused Umar Farooq, 46, the brother-in-law of Shahul Hameed, died during the trial. Shahul Hameed who returned from a job in a foreign country had gone missing from home on March 1, 2009. Based on a complaint from his wife Jawahar Nisha, Gandhi market police registered a case two days later. Since there was no progress in the investigations, Jawahar Nisha filed a habeas corpus petition in Madras high court and also pleaded to transfer the case to CBCID in 2011.

The investigation assumed a new dimension after the court transferred the case to CBCID with the officers confirming that he was murdered. His body was exhumed from a cemetery in the city, but police were left with no evidence to trace the accused. However, CBCID police soon managed to solve the puzzle and arrest the accused. The inquiry brought to light that Shahul Hameed used to send money to Jawahar Nisha when he was abroad.

On his return, when he asked for the money his wife told him that her family members had spent it. Subsequently, Shahul Hameed met Umar Farooq at his house and asked him to return his money.

Kolkata: Students should be encouraged to share their plus and minus points with school heads and educators so that they can boost their strength and work upon their weaknesses. Moreover, the teacher-student relationship should be open and transparent, in fact more like friends. This advice came from Prosenjit Chatterjee at the Times NIE “In Conversation With Prosenjit Chatterjee ” with principals at the Tollygunge Club on Saturday. HDFC Bank was the associate partner while it was powered by ZTrack, a unit of Funscholar Innovations Pvt. Ltd.

The Tollywood superstar had everyone in the Yule 150 hall spellbound for over an hour as he held forth on his childhood, school days, film career, fitness secrets and his life as a parent in an informal chat with well-known painter Ashok Haralalka.“Prosenjit Chatterjee is my brand, but I would like to be remembered as a human being first, as Bumba” he averred right at the onset.

The actor got many a moment to go down memory lane as he spoke about ‘Chhoto Jigyasa’, his first film as a child star. “I was barely four-and-a-half or five years old when I did that film, so I have very faint memories. But yes I remember I would eagerly say ‘I am ready for shooting, shooting khela’. We had a bungalow in Tollygunge and the entire unit stayed there during the shoot. I also remember running barefoot on Bally Bridge for the final shot and despite all the pain I kept running. People then said I had the ability to bare pain like a military man,” said Chatterjee who became emotional talking about the late Rituparno Ghosh.

Talking about his school days, he said that initially he was in South Point School and then was shifted to St Xavier’s Collegiate School. “I feel so good, like a god whenever I walk through those corridors....I always make it a point to go back to SXC to interact with the students. I owe so much to St Xavier’s... my days there taught me how to be disciplined and inspired me to become an actor.” About his son, he added, “Trishanjit is not interested in doing films, rather he is very keen to become an international soccer player. I have sent him to London to study and also get a chance to play good football. Arpita and I sent him to hostel in Kodaikanal as we wanted him to have a normal childhood away from Tollywood and the media.”

The Q and A session had his audience asking him the secret behind his youth, despite having crossed 50 years. “Not just me even Ajay Devgan, Akshay Kumar all seem more energetic after 45. It’s all inside your mind. My diet is like that of a sportsman,” he laughed. The event also saw presentations by HDFC Bank and Funscholar. Bumbada also unveiled the latter’s Ztrack, India’s first wearable tech watch for schools.

Kolkata: A 43-year-old owner of a boutique at Santoshpur Avenue has alleged that she fell victim to an unusual method of kepmari while she was managing her shop on Monday. A 50-year-old woman, reportedly a history-sheeter, is the prime suspect.

According to victim Mithu Mallick, a resident of Selimpur Lane, a dark complexioned healthy woman aged around 50 had come to her shop around 11am on Monday. “She waited for a couple of minutes before asking me to show some sarees. I had climbed up a few stairs to bring sarees from the store when I felt some liquid hit me. The woman then applied some strange balm on my hand. Even as the woman told me that I looked ill and I needed rest, I realized she was tugging at my gold chain. I could only feebly protest before I lost consciousness,” Mallick said.

The accused calmly removed all the jewellery from Mallick and took away Rs 17,000 in cash. Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said they had received leads about the accused from CCTV footage. “She seems an old hand. Mallick has had a history of epilepsy. We are looking at all possible angles,” said Sharma.

Panaji: The government’s proposal to setup Goa Bazaar on 30,000sqm of land at Merces with Rs 12 crore funding from the Centre is now stuck for want of administrative approvals.The rural development agency has already prepared the plans for the buildings and is waiting for approval from the expenditure finance committee before floating a tender for the project.

A senior bureaucrat has stalled the move to construct a space for artisans and women entrepreneurs, along the lines of Dilli Haat in the national capital, on the grounds that the site chosen for Goa Bazaar is a low- lying area, said rural development agency (RDA) minister Michael Lobo.

“Some secretary of some department has raised a query asking why we are building in a low-lying area. We have brought this to the chief minister’s attention, and we will have a meeting with him,” said Lobo, speaking to reporters at the CM’s official residence at Altinho.

The Union government had sanctioned Rs 12 crore for creation of Goa Bazaar with a condition that the funds have to be utilised within four years. RDA had acquired land at Merces but the land was subsequently divided and handed over for construction of the district court complex, said RDA director Sanjit Rodrigues.“When the funds were sanctioned, there was no plan. Now the plans have been made by GSIDC ,” he said.The district court complex is nearing completion, while Goa Bazaar has yet to get government approval. The project envisages minimal construction and the use of natural elements for the design of the 200-odd stalls for artisans and SHGs.

“The money is still lying with us. The utilisation of the money is for a period of 3-4 years, but we have not sent the money back. We are telling the Centre that we are doing it,” Lobo said. The minister said that Goa Bazaar can give self-help groups, women entrepreneurs and Goan artisans a year-round platform to promote and sell their products.

The illegal unit may be sealed

BHUBANESWAR: The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday dismantled an unauthorised polythene carry bag manufacturing unit at Bhagawanpur.

Acting on a tip-off, a special enforcement squad of the BMC conducted a raid and seized a large quantity of polythene bags. BMC additional commissioner Abani Patnaik said the unit was illegal because it was making polythene bags of less than 50 micron thickness, which are banned.

“The raid was conducted in the presence of police and officers from the Odisha State Pollution Control Board. The unit also did not have an updated trade licence certificate,” said Patnaik.

The squad has also seized the raw materials used to make the bags. “There was a huge stock of raw materials at the facility, besides machinery and water containers. The pollution control board will take a call on whether the unit will be sealed,” said a BMC officer.

The BMC had earlier said there was no manufacturer of plastic bags in the city. The illegal unit couldn’t be traced initially as it had not obtained a trade licence. The BMC was under the impression that wholesalers were buying polythene carry bags from outside Odisha.

The enforcement squad of the BMC has been conducting raids since October 2, 2019, to ensure that the banned polythene bags are no longer in circulation and are replaced by alternatives like paper and woven bags. On October 2, the state government had placed a blanket ban on single-use polythene across all 114 urban local bodies. On the same day, it had announced a ban on polythene in five cities.

In another development, the BMC squad intercepted a truck carrying banned polythene plates and bowls in Khandagiri. The police were asked to seize the truck. “We have imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on the truck owners for transporting banned polythene plates. The consignment was coming from Cuttack,” said an officer.

Panaji: The 12-day trade fair for rural artisans, Saras, will be held at SGPDA grounds, Margao, from Thursday.

Rural development agency minister Michael Lobo said 200 stalls will be put up to help self-help groups (SHGs) and women artisans to earn an income.

The South Goa District Rural Development Agency is organising the festival, with the state and Centre contributing Rs 35 lakh each.

“This will bring a lot of income and revenue for SHGs, this is our main purpose,” Lobo said. He also said that the state government sought to hold the Saras festival twice a year even if it has to foot the entire bill. Saras is an annual event where SHGs from across the country use common financial resources to sell their products. It is also organised in other states to which the state rural development agency sends artisans from Goa to promote and sell their products.

At the last Saras, artisans and SHGs earned an income of Rs 1.3 crore. This year, around 250 artisans will participate in the fair.

Aside from the trade fair, there will be games for children and entertainment programmes on all the days to enhance public participation.

A file photo shows an anti-CAA and NRC poster at a protest site

AURANGABAD: Nonagenarian freedom fighter Murgappa Kulse led hundreds of Latur residents in their protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register for Citizen (NRC) at the Dr Ambedkar Park in the city.

Latur activists began their three-day sit-in agitation from Wednesday evening at the Dr Ambedkar Park, where hundreds of people had gathered to express their solidarity with the protesters. Different groups have come together to form ‘Amhi Laturkar, CAA, NRC Virodhi Jan Andolan’, to resist the CAA and NRC.

Uday Gaware, a lawyer activist, said that despite his age, Kulse joined the agitation because he feels that the new law was intended at dividing the people.

“The central government’s move was an attempt to create a rift between different communities and cause havoc and confusion in the country. This was being done to divert people’s attention from core issues such as falling economy, increasing prices of essential commodities and rising unemployment,” Gaware claimed.

Intellectuals and social activists from across the country were expected to arrive in Latur over the next couple of days to join in their agitation.

Gaware said that these moves were not limited to targeting Muslims, but the government intended to hit Hindus too, particularly sections like Adivasi, OBC, Buddhists, and other communities.

Meanwhile, a group of lawyers in Beed staged anti-CAA and NRC agitation in front of the district court on Wednesday demanding the government to scrap the controversial law, while the sit-in agitation launched at different places including Nanded and Aurangabad continued on Wednesday.

NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday issued notice to Congress legislator from Umred Raju Parwe on a petition challenging his victory in assembly elections held in October last year.

Justice Vinay Deshpande asked the MLA to reply within six weeks. The judge also directed the registry to club all pleas challenging Parwe’s election and list it together.

Petitioner Shivaji Sonkusare from Kuhi, through counsel Uday Dable, alleged that Parwe did not disclose details of his income tax returns filed by him in last five years in the affidavit submitted to the state election commission.

According to him, the Representation of People’s Act makes it mandatory for all candidates to submit their income tax details for last five years, but Parwe had mentioned information related to only one year.

The petitioner had earlier raised same objection before collector-cum-returning officer, but he ignored all complaints.

Subsequently, he won the polls by defeating BJP’s sitting MLA Sudhir Parwe. The petitioner then knocked judiciary’s doors.

Sonkusare prayed for cancellation of Parwe’s victory from Umred as he had allegedly violated the provisions of Representation of People’s Act.

PANAJI: The transport department has recorded 143 cases of private taxis and other violators parking illegally outside and behind the Konkan railway station in Margao . In the year 2018, 262 violators were found and penalised.

The Margao taxi drivers and operators association comprising yellow and black taxis went to court alleging that private taxi operators, rickshaws and motorcycles were depriving them of carrying out their business legally, by operating from the space that was notified for them.

The association alleged that the director of transport had not taken effective steps to implement the court’s 2013 order. The high court on April 4, 2013 had directed the government to prevent tourist taxi operators and private vehicles on hire from illegally and unauthorisedly parking and operating from the approach road outside and behind Konkan railway station in Margao.

The court in 2013 had also directed the government to prevent black and yellow rickshaws and motorcycles from parking and operating in the space notified for black and yellow taxis.

The counsel representing the Margao taxi drivers and operator’s association, advocate Sanman Keny submitted to the court that tourist taxis and operators of private vehicles were illegally parking on the approach road behind the railway station, despite a legal notice to the assistant director of transport, (enforcement wing) Margao.

At the last hearing on Monday, advocate general Devidas Pangam assured the court that necessary steps would be taken to comply with the April 2013 order. The district magistrate of South Goa in 1997 had notified a stand for 15 black and yellow cabs on the left side of the approach road to the station, and another stand on the right side for 20 black and yellow rickshaws and 10 motorcycles. In 2000, a notification was issued permitting parking for 15 additional taxis, taking the total to 30. The stand was later notified as a ‘parking place’.

In 2008, the Margao taxi drivers and operators association was awarded a tender to operate a prepaid taxi counter for five years commencing from 2008 upon payment of license fee of Rs 95,000 per year apart from electricity charges and security deposits.

NEW DELHI: Following the Mumbai model, Delhi may get 24x7 markets if Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) wins the February 8 assembly elections. Inclusion of dentistry, dermatology and mental health facilities in polyclinics, a premium bus service, shelters for homeless people and multiple small sports complexes are likely to be among other promises to be included in the party manifesto.A three-member committee headed by Atishi, the key brain behind AAP government ’s education policies who has been fielded from Kalkaji, is finalising the manifesto, which is likely to be released on Sunday.According to a source, AAP is exploring the option of keeping some markets open 24x7 on a pilot basis to give Delhiites a night life and help businesses grow. The project will be extended to more markets if the pilot proves successful.The idea is to make the capital function like other big cities across the world, said the source. The launch of the 24-hour markets, however, requires proper security arrangements. All aspects of the project will be considered and every stakeholders will be taken into confidence before launching the project, he said.The government has already installed 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras across Delhi and another 1.4 lakh are being installed to make the city safer for everybody, especially women, the source said.

The rides will not only be comfortable and pleasant but also help in reducing traffic congestion and curb air pollution,” said the source, adding that all roads will also be paved to contain dust.The party will promise a robust transport system with over 11,000 buses, over 500 km metro network, and better last-mile connectivity. A better public transport system will also make the city safer for women, the source said.The manifesto is likely to draw largely from “Kejriwal Ki 10 Guarantee”, released recently by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

VADODARA: A state tax officer by the anti-corruption bureau in Kuber Bhavan on Wednesday.

The accused Priti Vispute was caught red-handed accepting Rs 15,000 from a pharmaceutical wholesaler. Vispute had demanded the money to reduce the amount of tax and issue assessment order.

The complainant had received a notice from the office of assistant state tax commissioner around four months back regarding the payment of value-added tax (VAT) for the financial year 2015-16. The complainant reached Vispute’s office along with all documents. Vispute told him that double entries were made by him in his books of accounts.

For the error, the complainant was asked to pay Rs 12 lakh penalty along with interest and an additional amount of Rs 80,000 as tax. ACB officials said that Vispute later told the complainant that she can reduce the tax amount as much as she can, but the wholesaler will have to pay Rs 15,000.

As the complainant did not want to bribe her, he informed ACB. On receiving the complaint, a trap was laid and the pharmaceutical wholesaler went to pay the bribe amount on Wednesday. After a brief conversation, Vispute accepted the money and immediately ACB officials raided her office on the fourth floor of Kuber Bhavan.

ACB officials refused to divulge details and said that Vispute will be produced before a special ACB court on Thursday.

CHENNAI: Nearly half of all crimes against children in Tamil Nadu are sexual offences and their number has also gone up by 18% in 2017-18, according an analysis by Child Rights and You (CRY) of the 2018 National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data.

Crimes against children in Tamil Nadu rose 250% in the last five years, revealed the analysis. And, 49% of all the crimes came under The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. The 18% rise in the number of sexual offences is almost double the national average of 9.9%. Christuraj Savarinayagam, advocate and child rights activist, pointed out that this could be because of better reporting, “but the rate of crime is also worrying”.

“Perpetrators are getting smarter, tactful and finding new ways to abuse children. The state needs to put in place strong child protection systems in every village, town and city to combat such crimes,” Savarinayagam said.

A total of 4,155 crimes were reported against children in Tamil Nadu during the past one year, which accounts for 3% of the crimes against children reported across the country. Tamil Nadu is also one of five states that reported the most cases of procuring of minor girls. There has been a 95% increase in the number of cases reported in the state over a period of one year — 76 cases reported in 2017 and 148 cases in 2018. During this time, the national average declined by 10%.

“It is really worrying to see Tamil Nadu recording so many crimes against children, especially under the Pocso Act. While education, awareness and community vigilance are key factors, more money flowing into child protection will be crucial to arrest this trend,” said Karthik Narayanan, regional director, CRY south.

A few months ago, the department of social welfare had announced that it would maintain its own registry of child sexual offenders, with the home department, to curb abuse in Tamil Nadu.

The registry would have the address and biometric details of offenders like the national registry for sex offenders. This would help police keep a watch on offenders and ensure that they are not found near schools, parks or areas frequented by children. In case they migrate, authorities in the states concerned would be alerted.

“The registry will be released soon, we are working on it,” said a senior official from social welfare department.

Bengaluru: Sri Gururaghavendra Sahakara Bank Nimyamita (SGSBN), a Bengaluru-based co-operative bank which was in news recently after the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) imposed curbs on cash withdrawals from it, has admitted that its non-performing assets ( NPAs ) are worth Rs 600 crore and 69 of its major borrowers are defaulters .

The admission came during a meeting the bank officials had on Tuesday with their members.

Bank sources said the deposits with the bank totalled Rs 2,800 crore, while its outstanding loans stood at Rs 1,677 crore. The bank’s NPAs are what led the RBI the restrict withdrawals. The 69 major defaulters owe the bank of Rs 372 crore. However, the bank has 100% collaterals against the NPAs, the officials said.

The bank told customers that after RBI's intervention, Rs 32 crore was recovered from borrowers and another Rs 55 crore will be recovered by January 31.

The bank started issuing notices to borrowers from Monday under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest (SARFAESI) Act.

Sources said, after RBI's intervention that an account holder should be allowed to withdraw not more than Rs 35,000, Rs 25 crore had been pulled out of the bank. It has also been discovered that the bank had purchased an asset worth Rs 19.9 crore.

The bank told its customers, ""RBI has been auditing our accounts every year for 10 years but could not find any flaw. For the first time, they rang an alarm bell and gave us 42 days. However, they did not wait for 42 days and imposed the withdrawal cap.”

While many customers expressed concerns over lack of transparency, the management has agreed to publish a weekly report on recoveries. The bank has also submitted to the RBI applications from its account holders seeking exemption citing medical emergencies.

The bank has stated that it has a strategy in place to recover Rs 100 crore by the end of January and Rs 200 crore by the end of February and Rs 175 crore by March end.

The management said they are not likely to go for elections as only 901 of the 8,000 shareholders turned up for the meeting and a majority of them are not eligible to vote as they had not appeared for three consecutive general body meetings.

VPT deputy chairman PL Haranadh confirmed the development. “We have already formulated a DPR, and a SPV will be formed soon. Once that happens, we can fix a timeline for the project,” he told TOI.

FTWZ is designated as a deemed foreign territory and is envisaged to be integrated zones to be used as international trading hubs. FTWZ status allows units to provide value added services to customers including packing, re-packing, labelling, knitting and bundling among other services . Thus, the zones could act as consolidation or distribution hubs for foreign and Indian clients alike.

As per the initial blueprint, land utilisation has been divided into three parts: Processing zone, non-processing zone and infrastructure-related land in the ratio of 69:12:19, an official said.

“Processing zone would primarily include warehousing zones of various kinds. The infrastructure zone would have roads and drainage facilities. The non-processing zone will comprise facilities such as power, fire, restrooms, green belt, truck terminal, office space and miscellaneous functions,” the officer added.

SDCL is expected to invest around Rs 240 crore towards infrastructure and other work related to the project. Both VPT and SDCL will form an special purpose vehicle (SPV) which will invest around Rs 110 crore to run the facility and retain earnings from the project. The cost of land provided by VPT is Rs 150 crore.

“As per proposal, road shows and awareness campaigns will be conducted to pick up the demand of the FTWZ. It’s an important project because the region lacks any facility of this nature,” an official pointed out.

A senior citizen is helped by workers at a polling station in Gundlapochampally.

HYDERABAD: The elections for 120 municipalities and nine municipal corporations across the state on Wednesday saw a huge turnout. However, in districts bordering Hyderabad such as Medchal-Malkajgiri and Rangareddy turnouts were relatively low. The state election commission (SEC) said that Nalgonda district saw the highest turnout.

The SEC is likely to order re-polling for one booth in Ward 41 of Kamareddy municipality where a tender vote was polled. The commission has asked the Kamareddy collector to submit a report on the incident.

The SEC announced that the average voter turnout across the state was little over 70% with Choutuppal recording the highest turnout (93.31%) and Nizampet the lowest (39.65%).

In the IT belt, turnout remained relatively low as companies did not declare a holiday for voting. In some cases, officials said, some IT employees came in to vote during the first two hours of polling.

Polling went on smoothly across the states except a few stray incidents of cases between workers of different parties. Incidents of violence were reported from erstwhile Mahabubnagar, Khammam, Nizamabad, Rangareddy and Karimnagar districts. Most scuffles were over allegations by various political parties on the use of money and other items to influence voters. On the day of polling, five cases of assault pertaining to polls had been recorded across state.

In Nalgonda and Wyra police arrested workers from political parties who were allegedly distributing liquor and cash to voters on Tuesday night. Nizamabad police registered a case against TRS 41 ward candidate Changubai for allegedly distributing cash and liquor. In some cases, police had to resort to light lathicharge to disperse crowds.

Though there were no major complaints of missing names in the electoral lists, in Nizamabad municipal corporation, people in Wards 35 and 36 claimed around 150 names were missing in the voter list.

A polling staff in Kompally uses a smartphone to take photos of voters

KOMPALLY: It took just three minutes for D Dharani, a final-year BCom student, to cast her vote and leave the polling booth. What helped her finish the process of exercising her franchise within minutes was the facial recognition technology.

“I came to the polling booth for the first time. I wondered what were the polling staff doing using a smartphone,” said Dharani, who voted at the Zilla Parishad High School, Kompally.

The State Election Commission (SEC) launched the facial recognition technology for voters of select 10 polling stations in Kompally Municipality of Medchal Malkajgiri district. A total of 7,700 voters cast their vote at these 10 polling stations.

The use of the new technology entails a polling official verifying a voter’s ID proof using a smartphone, and then taking his/her photo. The voter’s photo is then upload on the server using ‘face recognition app’.

This image is tallied with the photo on the voters’ list. If, the image is tallied, a green mark appears on the smartphone, stating he/she is a genuine voter.

“It is highly appreciable that the State Election Commission (SEC) has used such a technology to ease the voting process. They should continue this for assembly and Lok Sabha elections,” Dharani told TOI.

MNR Jyoti, Kompally municipal commissioner and assistant district election authority, said: “A voter who enters with a polling slip and voter ID card comes out after exercising his/her vote within two minutes, thanks to the facial recognition app. We cannot download this app from Play Store. The Telangana State Technology Services (TSTS), which developed this technology, trained 10 polling personnel. We have purchased 10 smartphones exclusively for this purpose.”

A couple, N Ratna Kumari, a homemaker, and N Suresh, a techie, were also excited about the use of technology in the electoral process. “It is a good initiative launched by the SEC, that too in Kompally municipality,” Suresh told TOI. “Bogus voters can be filtered out through this newly launched facial recognition technology,” said M Arjun Reddy, a resident of NCL Colony, Kompally.

Representative image

SAMBALPUR: To make the campus disabled-friendly, the Gangadhar Meher University ( GMU ) will construct a ramp in the varsity building at an estimated cost of Rs 61.87 lakh. Deputy registrar U C Pati said the central public works department (CPWD) has finalised a firm that would execute the work. It will be funded under Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA).

Pati said the ramp will originate from near the lecture gallery no.1 and connect to lecture gallery no. 2 in the first floor and from there it will connect to the commerce department. “Work will start by the month-end and work on the ramp will be completed within three months,” he said.

He said since the university building is an old one it does not have a ramp now. “Because of the absence of a ramp, the disabled students often face problems in attending classes on the first floor. There are around five disabled students in the institution now. Currently, we provide a tricycle to the disabled students to go to their classes on the ground floor. But they face problems in attending classes on the first and second floors,” he added.

He said a toilet block is being constructed on the premises of the varsity at an estimated cost of Rs 77. 58 lakh. “We have made special arrangements for the disabled in the toilet block too. This apart, we have also decided to have a lift in the new multi-storey academic building so that disabled students will not have to face any difficulty in attending classes,” he said.

252,['23/01/2020'],Bengaluru: Draft CMP gets 475 citizen responses; most oppose elevated road proposal,"This story is from January 23, 2020

The plan suggests 33%-50% of the new road capacity be earmarked for public transport

BENGALURU: The draft Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) released by Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) and Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) has received as many as 475 responses from Bengalureans.

It was in public domain since December 6 and the last date for submission of comments/suggestions was January 20.

“A total of 475 responses have been received by DULT and BMRCL. A mail sent on behalf of several people is counted as one response. That shows that a large number of people have read the document and hopefully given constructive suggestions. Each suggestion will be considered carefully and thereafter, a final document will be submitted by DULT and BMRCL to the government,” BMRCL managing director Ajay Seth told TOI.

An online campaign initiated by Citizens for Bengaluru and Jhatkaa.org on act.airalert.in, which has garnered 3,244 signatures, acted as a platform for citizens to send comments on CMP. Other cities have seen lukewarm response to CMPs.

Many activists questioned the two agencies for coming up with a CMP, saying it’s not their job. However, most respondents objected to inclusion of elevated corridors in the plan.

“The Centre’s Metro Policy 2017 requires every city wanting a Metro network to have a CMP. If Bengaluru needs new Metro lines, including ORR-airport line, it has to have a CMP. There is no law which mandates or prohibits any particular agency from preparing it. Ultimately, it’s a government document which has to be approved by the government. All government agencies concerned were consulted while drawing up the document,” said a senior official from the urban development department (UDD).

“DULT and BMRCL jointly formulated CMP on the government’s directions. An activist group had filed a writ petition a few months ago seeking direction to the government and its agencies to prepare the plan. Another group recently asked people not to make suggestions as it felt the document was illegal,” he added.

On inclusion of the elevated corridor in CMP, he said: “The plan has proposed Metrolite along north, south and central ring alignment of elevated roads and suggested review of the currently approved elevated roads. It has suggested that 33%-50% of the new road capacity, including on the elevated corridor, be earmarked for public transport (exclusive bus lanes). In fact, it suggests elevated roads as the last option.”

The official clarified: “The government approved ORR Metro in 2017. But the Centre hadn’t considered the request so far for want of a CMP. Mere inclusion in CMP doesn’t mean an elevated road or any other project has been approved. Each project has to go through the process of alternative investment analysis and appraisal before being given administrative approval.”

Marigowda Road wears a new look

BENGALURU: The Dr MH Marigowda Road stretch from Dairy Circle towards Hosur Road which had been closed to vehicles for nearly three months for whitetopping is set to open on Monday.

The 1.4-km stretch was riddled with potholes, prompting the civic body to take up whitetopping on November 11, 2019.

""I am glad that I will be using this road again because it will save so much time. Earlier I had to take a detour for my commute from Shantinagar to Tavarekere and ended up spending 20 more minutes,"" said Rahul Nair, a resident of Tavarekere.

Apeksha Muthappa, a student of Christ College, said she is more than glad as the road will now open. ""I had to start early just to reach college because the road was blocked,” she said.

Due to the whitetopping work, motorists had to take a diversion at Dairy Circle and travel through Bannerghatta road, Mico Road Cross and SG Palya and reach Forum Mall to get back to Hosur Road.

“The white-topping had to happen sooner, but it was taken up under the second package of the first phase of white-topping, which was sanctioned in 2017,” said a senior BBMP official, adding that the work was delayed due to the proposed metro work and delayed approval for traffic diversion.

BTM Layout MLA Ramalinga Reddy told TOI, “This is the first time that a white-topping project has actually been executed and completed on time.”

Admitting that there was a little inconvenience to road users, Reddy said people will now be able to commute without any accidents due to potholes.

Asked when the work on the other carriageway of the road carrying traffic from Hosur Road to Dairy Circle would be taken up, Reddy said it would begin in a month or so.

HYDERABAD: BJP MP Bandi Sanjay said that Karimnagar commissioner of police VB Kamalasan Reddy is behaving like a TRS worker rather than a police officer.

The Karimnagar MP alleged that stones were pelted at him during campaigning few days ago and said he faced a threat to his life. However, the CP said there was no attack on Sanjay and only rumours were being spread.

Kamalasan said the information circulating on WhatsApp and social media was wrong. “We have been protecting public representatives with utmost care. If there indeed was an attack on Sanjay, he would have brought it to our notice,” he said.

The MP said he did not rake up the issue before as it would have provoked his party workers leading to a law and order issue. He alleged that Kamalasan’s bias towards TRS was not acceptable.

HYDERABAD: Stray incidents of clashes between supporters of different political parties were reported across the state on Wednesday. The scuffles broke out over allegations of influencing voters during the municipal polls.

In Nizmabad’s Bodhan municipality, a TRS candidate was injured after a Congress candidate allegedly bit the former’s nose. The TRS worker, Imran, was admitted to hospital as he was bleeding profusely. The Congress worker was taken into custody following a complaint by TRS. In Gadwal’s Ganjipet booth, a clash broke out between supporters of AIMIM and Congress. “It was mild scuffle which took place between two contesting candidates near a polling station. Police controlled the situation immediately. We will be registering a case against the concerned persons,’’ Gadwal SP K Apoorva Rao told TOI.

Similarly in Boduppal’s Ward 6, there was a scuffle between TRS and Congress over an allegation of distribution of money to influence voters. In another ward, a Congress supporter was allegedly heckled by TRS cadres. Supporters of BJP and TRS in Alkapur also accused each other of influencing voters, an altercation broke between supporters of both parties over being allowed inside the booth.

Police had to resort to light lathicharge in Rangareddy’s Jalpally municipality to disperse the crowd around a polling booth. Few in the area alleged that the police were TRS supporters and had neglected bogus voting in Ward 11.

Few incidents of candidates luring voters also came to fore. Police arrested a candidate with Rs 5 lakh cash in Boduppal while another person was taken into custody from Kamareddy for distributing nose rings to women voters. In Badangpet, police had to step in to break a scuffle between Congress and TRS cadres. Additional forces were deployed after the incident.

According to director general of police (law and order) Jitender, a total of 21 election-related cases had been registered of which five pertained to assault. “The assault cases were booked in Gadwal, Bodhan and Khammam. In Khammam and Bodhan, it was a complaint and counter-complaint from the other party. The rest of the cases were related to bogus voting, distribution of money and other election code violations. There were no major incidents of violence,” Jitender said.

HYDERABAD: Dabeerpura ’s Ward 30, the only ward under Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) going for election, saw a turnout of just over 27%. Investigation by TOI revealed that most residents were not even aware that the election was taking place.

In some cases, locals said that they had not even received voter slips while many opined that they had lost interest in polls as there had been no development in the past few years. They said they were aware of NOTA but chose to stay at home instead. “Unlike regular polls, we did not get voter slips. My family informed me this morning (about the election) but when I reached the booth, I could not find my name,” said Hussain who returned from his booth at Spring Dale High School in Noorkhan Bazaar as he could not find his name on the rolls. “I don’t even recall any political parties campaigning in the past ten days or so,” Hussain added.

Like Hussain, many said that there had indeed been no campaigning which led many to believe that Wednesday was like just any other working day. “I was not even aware that there was an election. It was only when I saw police personnel deployed in our locality did I come to know about it,” said Aleem Khadri, another resident.

Many slammed political parties and said that a lack of development was the reason behind the low turnout.

“There has hardly been any development in our area for years therefore I decided to stay away from polls this time,” said a resident of Panjetan Colony. She said that she also knew about the NOTA option but had decided to give voting a miss regardless. Of the over 50,000 voters in the ward, just 13,000 exercised their franchise. Representatives of political parties were seen trying to urge locals to come out and vote.

HYDERABAD: Much is at stake for Congress and BJP as the poll results on January 25 will decide the fate of these parties on their claim of being the main opposition party to take on TRS. Congress and BJP have already conceded 80 wards, including 77 to TRS and three to AIMIM , without a contest.

BJP entered the fray in 2,313 wards, while Congress in 2,616 wards. Both the parties conceded defeat to TRS in the first round itself by failing to field candidates in over 30% wards of the total wards. As many as 739 wards went to polls without a BJP candidate, while 436 wards had no Congress candidate. With options running out, BJP and Congress leaders blamed the TRS government of ‘managing’ the State Election Commission and giving little time for the opposition parties to finalise the candidates.

Telangana Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy exuded confidence of winning a good number of municipalities and municipal corporations and his BJP counterpart K Laxman was equally exuberant, claiming that Wednesday’s polls would prove beyond doubt that his party is the only alternative to the ruling TRS.

Both BJP and Congress members blamed TRS for rampant distribution of money, liquor and gifts to lure the voters. “A free and fair election would see an outright Congress victory,” claimed Uttam.

262,['23/01/2020'],Thane station may house city’s first ‘oxygen parlour’ with walkways,"This story is from January 23, 2020

CR intends to place pollution-absorbing plants in a 1,200-sq-ft space at Thane.

THANE: In the first such initiative in the city, health-conscious commuters could soon drop in at Thane station to inhale fresh air as an oxygen parlour is likely to be developed by Central Railways here.

The concept, said officials at Thane station, involves planting certain species of plants known to produce a massive volume of oxygen that will be housed in a specially designed space measuring over 1,200 square feet within the station premises. The stretch will have walkways to enable visitors to move around or stand in the parlour to enjoy the fresh air.

A few plants that are known to absorb harmful pollutants from the air would be identified and shortlisted with help of experts and planted here. Station officials will make arrangements to ensure adequate water supply for plants.

Thane station administration has already shortlisted a few spaces on the station premises where the initiative can be taken up. A request has been sent to the Mumbai division for approval. This initiative could be a step towards combating air pollution in cities, especially around Mumbai division, and if successful, it may be replicated elsewhere, said officials.

When contacted, R Meena, station manager at Thane, confirmed the development and said officials have sought permission from the railway administration and expect a response in a few days.

“The idea is to create a green station within the station premises for commuters to enjoy clean and fresh air. If approved, this could be the first such parlour in Mumbai division. A similar initiative was started by the railways in Nashik recently,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR.

While commuters and passengers have welcomed the move, they have raised questions over the space required for the facility. “Thane station is already congested, thanks to bridges and stalls. There is little space for passengers to move. Authorities should look at improving the frequency of trains instead of diverting attention towards other issues,” said a railway activist.

Rajkot: Abdasa Congress MLA Pradyumansinh Jadeja’s son has created a flutter on social media after he uploaded three videos on Instagram showing him to be firing in the air from his pistol and a 12 bore gun.

Police said they were checking the videos uploaded by Jaideepsinh Jadeja. “We will check the videos and book Jadeja for the crime, if the firearms seen in the videos are found to be without licence,” said P N Yadav, Nakhatrana deputy superintendent of police.

Meanwhile, Jadeja senior posted a statement on Facebook denouncing his son. He stated: “What Jaideepsinh did was wrong. However, he has licence of the firearms from which he was seen to be firing. The firing took place in our farmhouse.”

264,['23/01/2020'],Dhupkheda residents too want Saibaba temple funds,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Aurangabad: Amid the ongoing row over Saibaba’s birthplace, the time the saint spent in Dhupkheda in Paithan taluka of Aurangabad district and in Beed — before he moved to Shirdi in Ahmednagar — is now in focus.

It is believed Saibaba had briefly stayed in Dhupkheda, which also has a temple in his honour. However, Saibaba’s little-known connection to Beed has come into the limelight for the first time.

Ashok Kamal Pal, who manages the Saibaba Ashram at Dhupkheda, said the saint had stayed at Chandbhai Patil’s house before moving to Shirdi. “Patil was a wealthy village officer. One day, he had lost his mare and was desperately looking for it. But he could not find the mare. It was then that he encountered a fakir. That fakir was Saibaba, who miraculously helped Chandbhai Patil find his mare. Saibaba also performed a few miracles on the occasion, following which Chandbhai Patil requested the saint to visit his home,” Pal said.

Referring to the scriptures on Saibaba, Pal said the saint went to Patil’s house and stayed there for some time. “There was a wedding in Patil’s house and the bride was from Shirdi. So along with the groom’s party, Saibaba reached Shirdi and stayed there for the next 60 years,” he said.

Meanwhile, some people in Beed made a few unfounded claims. They said Saibaba had undertaken a job in one of the shops in the town for a few years. The locals said the British rulers had also taken note of Saibaba’s presence in Beed and had gifted him a pagdi (a traditional headgear).

As the state government has declared funds worth Rs 100 for development of Pathri, a section of devotees has also demanded financial assistance for the development of the Sai temple at Dhupkheda. A group of Shiv Sena functionaries, led by Parbhani MP Sanjay Jadhav, was scheduled to meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday. The temple trustees and the action committee for Pathri development, however, were not taken along.

Jadhav was said to be in a fix following the stand taken by his party on the row through party mouthpiece ‘Saamna’. In an editorial piece, the mouthpiece had termed the Saibaba birthplace row “uncalled for” and added that the CM can’t be blamed for it. Jadhav could not be reached for his comments.

TIRUPUR: The state human rights commission (SHRC) has directed to pay Rs 50,000 as compensation to a couple, who was harassed and threatened by a sub-inspector.

V Rajasekar and his wife Thilagavathy are residing at John Jothi Garden in Andipalayam. SI C B Vijaya Mohan , who was then attached to the Tirupur north police station, constructed a house adjacent to the couple’s residence. He had deviated from the plan approved by the city corporation as some windows and staircase touched the compound wall of the couple’s house.

Rajasekar and Thilagavathy objected to the deviation as it was affecting their privacy. But the SI threatened them.

The couple filed a complaint before SHRC in April 2018, stating that the SI was threatening to foist false cases on them and put them behind bars if they continued to question the building violation. “He sent anti-social elements to threaten us. Because of the harassment, tenants were not staying in our house,” the complaint said.

The couple had earlier filed complaints to the collector, city police commissioner and the city corporation regarding the building violation and harassment. They submitted those documents along with CCTV footages before SHRC, which found Mohan guilty.

SHRC member A Chittaranjan Mohandoss said the police officer misused his power and violated the rights of the complainants. The commission recommended state additional chief secretary to pay the compensation.

Illustration used for representational purpose

AURANGABAD: While the state government has ordered up to Rs 2 lakh crop loan waiver , advocacy groups working for the welfare of farmers have objected to the mandatory requirement of Aadhaar card for availing the benefit.

Highlighting the alleged inordinate delays in Aadhaar enrollment and update, farmer groups have raised apprehensions that the desired benefit might not reach several farmers for the want of Aadhaar card.

Farmers’ leader Jayaji Suryawanshi said it was unjust on part of the government to link the loan-waiver measure with Aadhaar card.

“While no official record of Aadhaar coverage among farmers is available with the government, we every day come across numerous complaints related to difficulties faced by farmers for Aadhaar enrolment and update,” he said.

Civic activist Abhijit Dhanorkar said it does not make much sense to ask farmers to produce Aadhaar card for getting loan waiver.

“Farmers are already getting all the government benefits in form of money directly depositing into their bank accounts. Such accounts are already KYC compliant and can easily ensure that no bogus beneficiary can reap the benefit of government welfare programmes,” he said.

When contacted, some Aadhaar enrollment agencies in the city admitted that the process of new registration for Aadhaar has slowed down in recent past.

“Meanwhile Vasa’s father Abdul Vasa received a message that Vasa was found injured at Gulabnagar locality of Jamnagar, following which Abdul called up Barai who approached us.

Panaji: The opposition on Wednesday demanded that Goa speaker Rajesh Patnekar take a cue from the Supreme Court’s directives on disqualification petitions pending with speakers of legislative assemblies, and decide on the handful of disqualification petitions pending before him.

MGP, Congress and GFP said Patnekar should decide the fate of the 15 MLAs who switched over to BJP under questionable circumstances and should also send a signal to discourage party-hopping.

“This decision will strengthen democracy. This will stop MLAs from going to one party to the next. The speaker should take up our disqualification petition and dispose it of as quickly as possible,” said lone MGP MLA and former deputy chief minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar.

In a judgment, the apex court asked the Manipur assembly speaker to decide within four weeks the plea seeking disqualification of BJP lawmaker and Manipur forest minister Th Shyamkumar, who won the election on a Congress ticket only to switch over to the BJP camp.

Immediately after the 2017 state assembly election results, Vishwajit Rane quit Congress. After he switched over to BJP, Mandrem MLA Dayanand Sopte and Shiroda MLA Subhash Shirodkar followed suit by ditching Congress in favour of the saffron camp in October 2018.

Around the same time, two MGP MLAs split from the party and joined BJP without resigning as MLAs. Manohar Ajgaonkar and Deepak Pauskar skirted the anti-defection law as they formed two-thirds of the MGP legislative party.

Congress suffered the same fate in July 2019, when 10 of its MLAs, including opposition leader Chandrakant Kavalekar jumped ship and merged with BJP.

In all these instances, disqualification petitions were filed and these remain pending with the speaker’s office.

“The speaker has failed to even to send notices to the 10 MLAs who have claimed to have merged with BJP. We still maintain that there has been no split in Congress and that the merger is invalid,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar, said.

GFP also agreed with the Supreme Court’s ruling.

“We welcome the apex court’s suggestion that an independent mechanism should decide on disqualifications of lawmakers rather than the speaker. In light of the judgment, the speaker should decide on the pending disqualification petitions immediately. The petitions were filed in May and August of 2019. The speaker should stop acting like a henchman of BJP and decide on the petitions in a non-partisan manner,” GFP president Vijai Sardesai, said.

Mangaldeep Society on Old Padra Road

Vadodara: Complaints, representations and memorandums do not seem to be sufficient recourse to those suffering at the hands of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC).

A society on the posh Old Padra Road decided to slap a legal notice to the civic body and threatened to file a suit if its drainage line was not cleared at the earliest.

Residents of Mangaldeep Society that has 20 houses had been complaining about blocked drainages to the VMC since November 2019. But when a month passed and things did not move, the owners of houses issued a legal notice to the civic body in December. The move seems to have eventually moved things.

The notice was issued by lawyer Mukesh Thakkar on behalf of the residents. Thakkar himself is a resident of the society and had been trying to get the problem resolved. “The society does not have a registered association or society and there are no formal office bearers. All residents signed the notice that we submitted,” he said.

The notice states that the residents of the society used to pay their taxes regularly. It also pointed out that the right to pollution free water and safe drinking water that were a part of the Right to Life under the Constitution. The society was getting contaminated water due to the blocked sewage line and samples of the water had also been collected by civic officials.

“We issued the notice on December 2, but things did not move even quite some time after this. It was eventually an engineer from ward six who took up the issue and resolved it a couple of days back,” said Thakkar.

Bharat Polra, VMC deputy executive engineer of ward six, said that they had believed that the drainage line passed through the GEB Compound near the society. He said that a RCC road had been laid over the drainage line in the GEB Compound making it inaccessible.

“But later we realised that it had another connection in the nearby Tagore Nagar. The manhole in Tagore Nagar was inside the compound of a private residence. We took the help of a former corporator to ensure that the owner of the house was convinced to remove some flooring for work inside the manhole. The issue has been taken care of now,” he said. Despite the delay, the efforts have left even Thakkar impressed who said that after identifying the fault, Polra was quick to take care of the issue.

CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Wednesday directed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to talk to the Tamil Nadu government to ascertain the possibilities of sharing the Rs 8 crore revenue generated from the Mamallapuram monuments with the local administration for the upkeep and maintenance of the site.

A division bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice R Suresh Kumar passed the order on a suo motu plea initiated to preserve the beauty and safeguard and protect tourists visiting the town.

When the plea came up for hearing, G Karthikeyan, assistant solicitor-general of India, submitted that ASI generated revenue of Rs 8.14 crore from collection of entry fee from tourists visiting the monuments in 2018-19.

“The revenue was Rs 6.65 crore in 2017-18 and Rs 5.98 crore in 2016-17. For 2019-20, we have generated Rs 6.87 crore till December last,” Karthikeyan said.

He pointed out that while ASI is generating income by collecting entry fee from visitors, the local panchayat is also generating income by collecting entry and parking fee from vehicles entering the site.

“ASI is taking care of maintenance of monuments in the site annually and periodically, besides 411 other monuments across the state. The revenue collected is being deposited in the consolidated funds of the Union government and it would not plough back to ASI. Therefore, it is not possible to share any revenue collected from the entry fee,” Karthikeyan said.

Supriya Goel, 42, will undertake a 3,000-km-long bike ride to give strength to cancer patients.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Little did cancer survivor Supriya Goel who had been physically active since childhood know that she would be diagnosed with cancer in her late thirties.

In 2017, Goel was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer. Instead of several chemotherapy sessions, she chose to undergo two surgeries, radiation therapy for a few days and healthy living and positive thinking.

Now 42, Goel says that she has been given a second life, in which she has chosen to follow her childhood passion for biking. On January 26, she will embark on her maiden long-distance bike ride—a distance of around 3,000 km—to give strength to cancer patients and spread cheer among them.

Along with AP’s first female solo biker Vaishalli Kulkarni More, Goel will embark on the Coromandel to Konkan ride that will be flagged off from RK Beach Road on January 26.

Speaking to TOI, Goel said, “I have now a reason to chase my passion and to prove that women are strong. This ride will be my milestone and I have future plans to ride to other cities of north India.”

She added, “It took me six months to get back to normal life without chemotherapy. I was able to win this battle only because of a healthy lifestyle, positive thinking, inner strength and family support. I also urge every person to spend time with themselves and to do what they love. Physical activity should be a part of the daily routine of every individual.”

Prime accused in Samakhiyali police custody on Wednesday

Rajkot: Two persons who killed a 19-year-old youth in Shikarpur village of Bhachau taluka in Kutch district on Tuesday morning over a love affair, were arrested on Wednesday. Police said the accused duo, Mustaq and Imran Traya, had stabbed Jadeja to death.

Slain Kripalsinh Jadeja had eloped with Mustaq’s sister on January 19. They were caught from Momaimora village of Rapar taluka in Kutch district on January 20. On Tuesday, Mustaq and Imran went to Jadeja’s house and called him up to strike a compromise, said cops.

“The accused first allegedly kidnapped Jadeja in their car, took him to Bhachau-Bhuj highway where they slit his throat and then dumped the body in the main bazaar of Shikarpur village,” said A P Jadeja, sub-inspector with Samakhiyali police station, adding that Mustaq and Imran were arrested on the complaint by Jadeja’s brother Rajendrasinh.

“When Jadeja and Rajendrasinh came out of their house, they asked them to sit in their car and drove the brothers to the highway. On the way, they stopped the car and at knifepoint asked Rajendrasinh to go away. They then killed Jadeja,” said the police official.

The police have deployed bandobust in Shikarpur to maintain law and order after the situation turned tense, after the news of Jadeja’s murder spread. Cops have also seized the car belonging to Imran in which Jadeja had been kidnapped.

280,['23/01/2020'],Many highrises still at high risk,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Vadodara: Besides fighting regular fire incidents, Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services biggest challenge lies in making high rise buildings equip themselves with proper fire fighting infrastructure — a battle that they have been waging for past several years to no avail.

According to the fire department records, city has around 643 high rise buildings. Of these, only 350 have fire fighting equipment in working conditions as well as fire department’s no-objection certificate. Eleven buildings in different areas are among those that have never installed any fire fighting equipment since inception.

“New buildings which have come up after GDCR (General Development Control Regulations) and after the National Building Code came into effect, have all infrastructure in place. The problem lies with old buildings as the builders then never installed any of these measures and occupants now find it expensive to install everything from a scratch,” said a fire officer.

There are high rise buildings which have come up in past 10 years and have the infrastructure to tackle fire, but its occupants’ lackadaisical attitude towards regular maintenance render these useless, he added.

The GDCR have several details regarding construction of building including lobbies and corridors, installation of elevators, staircases among others so that losses in case of fire can be minimal.

Fire department sources said that as the power with them is limited, nothing can be done besides serving notices to the properties. “In the past we had sealed buildings, which we are not supposed, and snapped water connections but the owner would use political connections and our efforts turn out to be futile,” another fire officer said.

“We have chalked out a list of buildings which do not have no-objection certificates and respective fire stations will issue notices to them. However, this time we will be talking to the municipal commissioner to snap water connections of such buildings that fails to act within 30 days of our notice,” said in-charge chief fire officer Parth Brahmbhatt.

281,['23/01/2020'],Breast cancer cases in Tamil Nadu rising by 4% yearly: Data,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Representative image

COIMBATORE: A recent data presented by the Union health minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan, in reply to a question in Parliament on December 13 shows that the estimated number of breast cancer cases in Tamil Nadu has been steadily increasing by 4% every year.

As per the data, taken from the National Cancer Registry Programme, Tamil Nadu is estimated to have the fifth highest number of breast cancer cases in the country. It is the only state in South India to feature in the top five list.

Oncologists say that there seems to be no specific reason for Tamil Nadu’s numbers to be high. But attribute the increase to multiple factors - increasing obesity rates, increasing infertility rates among women and mutations of BRCA genes affecting more Indians. They say better reporting and diagnosis of cases could also lead to the number.

As per the registry, Tamil Nadu had around 10,269 breast cancer cases in 2018. In 2016, the state had 9,486 cases, which went up to 9,870 in 2017.

Dr R Swaminathan, who heads the Madras Metropolitan Cancer Registry in Adyar Cancer Institute and contributed to the National Cancer Registry’s data, confirms the data.

“In Chennai alone, the incidence of breast cancer in every 1 lakh women is increasing by 2%. Breast cancer has been increasing every year,” he says.

Tamil Nadu’s numbers are only lower than Uttar Pradesh, which had the highest number of estimated cases at 24,181, Maharashtra 16,358 cases, West Bengal 12,234 cases and Bihar 11,378 cases. While Karnataka’s figures are at least 10% lower than Tamil Nadu’s figures, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala’s estimates in 2018 are at least 40% lower.

“The Globocan 2018 data also found breast cancer to be the most common form of cancer in Tamil Nadu, and we think multiple factors contribute to this largely hormone driven cancer,” says consultant oncologist and associate professor at PSG Hospitals, Dr Kiruba Shankar.

“There are studies that show Tamil Nadu has high rates of obesity due to the growing affinity towards fast food and junk food. This eventually affects your hormones,” Dr Shankar says.

Growing rates of infertility and more people opting for hormone replacement therapy are also among the reasons for high breast cancer cases, say doctors. “Breast cancer is of three types and mainly hormone driven. We believe that increased exposure to estrogen in a woman’s lifestyle can increase risks. This happens due to too many menstrual cycles. Not having children or not breast feeding, and late menopause could also lead to increase in breast cancer,” says director of Sri Ramakrishna Institute of Oncology and Research, Coimbatore, Dr P Guhan.

Oncologists say what is more worrying is that breast cancer is affecting women in late twenties and early thirties, who ignore it as screening for breast cancer is usually advocated only after 40. “Even in the West, breast cancer is seen more in women’s end of fifth decade and sixth decade, but in India we are seeing a majority in the fifth decade, and number of women getting it in their third and fourth decade itself. So, more women should do self-examinations after they turn 30 and importantly approach at least their family doctor if they notice any abnormal swelling, lump or nipple discharge,” says Dr P Guhan.

However, doctors say all the above issues are present in other states too. “It could be a hereditary factor with many women today getting the gene mutation from their mothers or grandmothers, but we don’t see too many breast cancer cases due to this in Tamil Nadu. It could be better reporting of cases and more diagnosis also contributing to the numbers,” says Chennai-based oncology consultant Dr Bellaramine.

Illustration used for representational purpose

PUNE: A 21-year-old man was arrested and six boys — all school students aged 14 to 17 and coming from well-to-do families — were detained for allegedly assaulting a 24-year-old casual worker, who later succumbed to a head injury at the Sassoon hospital.

The assault took place at the Munjaba vasti chowk in Dhanori shortly after Tuesday midnight. The victim, Sagar Mahadev Bhalerao, was walking to his house at the vasti when he allegedly abused the arrested suspect, Pritam Rajkumar Jagdale, for riding his motorcycle close to him, an officer from the Vishrantwadi police said.

Citing preliminary investigation, assistant commissioner of police Laxman Borate told TOI, “Jagdale and one of the minor boys was heading home on his Royal Enfield motorcycle when he drove close to Bhalerao. The latter reacted instantly by allegedly abusing and threatening Jagdale. Jagdale challenged Bhalerao and told him to meet him at the nearby chowk. On the way to the chowk, Jagdale and his minor associate phoned the other boys, who gathered at the chowk. As soon as Bhalerao reached there, they launched a brutal assault on him.”

Borate said, “One of the assailants attacked Bhalerao with a bicycle chain, another hit him with a stick while the others dealt him kicks and blows. Bhalerao was initially admitted to a private hospital and later shifted to the Sassoon hospital where he died around 4.30am on Wednesday.”

Senior inspector Arun Avhad of the Vishrantwadi police told TOI, “We are waiting for the post-mortem report. However, doctors at the Sassoon hospital, in their preliminary opinion, have cited head injury as the primary cause of death.” A senior doctor at the hospital also confirmed to TOI that the victim had died of a head injury.

Borate said the fathers of three of the detained minors are state government officers while the other three fathers are employees of prominent private companies. “The six boys study in different schools but stay in the same neighbourhood. Jagdale is pursuing his graduation studies from a city college,” he said.

“There were a few paan kiosks open around the spot, but none of the local residents intervened in the fight. The boys left after Bhalerao fell on the road,” he said.

“A passerby called the police control room following which beat marshals from the Vishrantwadi police reached the spot. Bhalerao was sitting on a cement fence along the road. When the police asked him about his injuries, he said he had fallen on the road. He said that he was fine and would like to go home. He made no mention of the attack. On reaching home, Bhalerao narrated the incident to his younger brother Shubham, who took him to hospital,” Borate said.

The police arrested Jagdale on Wednesday morning.

283,['23/01/2020'],"Touts, illegal vendors stay put at airport 14 days after FIR","This story is from January 23, 2020

Kolkata: Unauthorized parking, touts pestering and conning flyers, illegal food stalls and unauthorized structures: everything that the city airport authorities had lodged a complaint against at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport police station a fortnight ago continued to operate with impunity on the airport premises.

To highlight the extent of the problem, the authorities had even attached a copy of the TOI’s report on taxi touts fleecing passengers published on December 30, 2019. Following the FIR registered on January 7, police had started a case under IPC sections dealing with extortion, criminal trespassing and criminal conspiracy and assured the authorities of taking strict action. But when TOI visited the airport on three consecutive days between January 20 and January 22, nothing seemed to have changed. In fact, some of the problems, like VIP vehicles blocking the area in front of the gates, were back. After TOI had earlier reported extensively on the illegal parking of VIP vehicles, the authorities had ensured that the cars waited at their designated lot, but the watch was ostensibly not maintained and the vehicles were back to flouting rules.

“We have asked the police time and again to take action against these illegal activities, which have not only been causing heavy losses to AAI revenue but have also been maligning the image of the Kolkata airport, considered the gateway to the east. They are also a big security threat to our passengers,” said airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee.

The authorities in the complaint mentioned encroachment by food vendors , some of whom have set up temporary stalls in the area opposite the old terminal building, an unauthorized canteen being operated out of the building that housed the police station, an unauthorized car rental company—M/S Helpline—occupying the counters in the arrival lane and that they illegally operated their taxis. The complaint also mentioned two problems that TOI had highlighted time and again: vehicles being parked at non-designated places, like the area in front of the existing and old terminal buildings and taxi touts fleecing passengers right under the nose of the cops. Stating that the encroachments in front of the old domestic terminal and the city side area in front of it came in the way of the expansion work of the new terminal building, the letter, signed by deputy general manager (commercial) V Nandhini requested the authorities to make arrangements and evict the squatters at the earliest.

But police claimed they had started a case under IPC sections 384 (extortion), 447 (criminal trespass), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention). “We have taken action against touts, clearing the airport premises of such men carrying out illegal activities. Also, we have made a dedicated parking bay for VIP vehicles and our personnel have been directing the VIP cars, clogging the area in front of the terminal, there. As for the other irregularities mentioned in the complaint, we undertake regular drives against all squatters,” a senior officer at Bidhannagar Commissionerate said.

However, when TOI visited the airport on Monday and Tuesday, the correspondent found VIP cars still clogging the area in front of the arrival gates of the terminal building for hours without anyone booking them, a number of suspicious-looking men standing outside Gates 2A/2b and 3A/3C, approaching fliers coming out of the airport and asking them to book cars with them. TOI also found scores of temporary stalls in front of the old domestic terminal, selling food, like rice and curry to fries and dosa, and a number of other stalls, selling tea and cigarettes. Asked, the owners said they regularly paid some men, who allowed them to operate out of there and that even if they had to move out during police drives, they could be back in a few days. A representative of M/S Helpline claimed they had the necessary authorization and allegedly paid an annual GST of Rs 4.5 lakh.

SECUNDERABAD: South Central Railway (SCR) zone witnessed a footfall of 91.3 lakh unreserved passengers from January 11 to January 20, owing to the Sankranti festive rush . The unreserved segment brought in Rs 45.7 crores to SCR’s revenue. SCR has announced 456 special trains from January 5 to January 25 to take care of the extra passenger rush.“The increase in the number of unreserved passengers commuting through the zone is 2.4 lakh more than last year and around six lakh more than regular average,” SCR officials said.Passengers travelling to and from their native places and the regular weekend rush contributed to the substantial rise in numbers, officials said. They added that the rush is expected to continue till the end of the month.“Daily travellers at premier stations such as Secunderabad and Kacheguda are expected to touch four lakh, which is double the usual number. We have, therefore, made additional arrangements, such as erecting extra counters, ATVMs, and CoTVMs. The dissemination of information was done through print, electronic, and social media and by putting up signage at prominent places,” said a senior SCR official.The zone almost doubled its running capacity this year, amid complaints of crowded compartments in reserved bogies, high ticket prices and insufficient trains.“It is hard to grab a ticket in Suvidha category.

KOLKATA: The special task force of Kolkata Police , probing into the heroin haul worth Rs 105 crore in the international grey market, found that the contraband was to reach the city from UP where it was mingled with the mixture coming from northeast before being smuggled across “international borders”.“Such a huge consignment cannot be meant only for this city or the state. We believe this was to be taken to the border areas for smuggling into Bangladesh . Such a corridor has been in existence from early 2000 when we busted a gang that used a similar modus operandi. There was even a shoot-out with gang members and the UP STF,” sources said.Cops are certain that both the accused — Maulana Fayazuddin (49) from Manipur and Juber (40) from UP — were trying to mix two types of drugs following the demands of different customers from across the country.“The two were mere carriers but even reaching them is a difficult task. The chain started when we nabbed a local dealer from AJC Bose Road. From there we reached his dealer in Tiljala. This led us to the UP linkman who finally spilled the beans and our sources worked accordingly on the leads,” said a police officer.Though the suppliers relied more on traditional methods of communication, those who had procured the contraband used encrypted messaging platforms like Telegram and WhatsApp.Sources ascertained the value of the seized heroin following its rate per kilogram as mentioned on the website of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. “As per the website, one kilogram of heroin is around Rs 40 lakh at the selling point where the raw form of the contraband is produced and processed.The drug has to pass through six or seven channels to cross Indian borders. Drug dealers have to bear 30% to 40% illicit value in addition to the actual rate at each channel. Eventually, when the contraband reaches India, it costs between Rs 3.5 crore and Rs 4.5 crore per kilogram, depending on quality,” said the police officer.According to the police, the increase in drug addiction among youngsters has become a major issue in the past few months. “Recently, several drug dealers and drug peddlers have been arrested for selling the contraband to school and college students. To curb the menace, we are planning to get in touch with school and college authorities and conduct counselling sessions for students to prevent them from getting addicted to drugs,” said a narcotics cell officer.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73539329,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-121851,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heroin-route-up-to-bdesh-via-kol/articleshow/73531621.cms

Coimbatore: Local administration and rural affairs minister S P Velumani on Wednesday called on the newly-elected village panchayat presidents and vice-presidents to remain directly in touch with the public and take care of their basic amenities.

He was speaking at the one-day training programme that the district administration organized for them. The event was attended by more than 300 panchayat presidents and vice-presidents from the district. They were trained in fund management, taxation, prioritization of funds and other administration related issues.

The minister also urged them to become good and able administrators. “Unlike MLAs who win with party support, you have won independently because you have already done service to the people. So, continue doing that and ensure that people’s basic amenities like roads and water are taken care of.”

Velumani said it was former chief minister, the late Jayalalithaa, who initially put in place a legislation reserving 50% of panchayat presidents’ posts for women. “It was she who gave me the strength and backing to pass the legislation. Compared to earlier times when panchayat presidents had no funding, as local minister I always allocate lots of funds for local bodies,” he said.

The programme at Kalai Arangam mainly focused on training the new panchayat heads in managing funds, as it was critical to take up development and infrastructure works in their villages. “They were mainly taught about the funds that they are entitled to as a local body and other funds that they could access if required and how to apply for the same. They were also trained in how to handle tax revenue and how to prioritize spending and implementation of various projects,” said an official with the district administration. “They were also told about how to organize a gram sabha, its frequency, ways to conduct it and how to choose beneficiaries for government welfare schemes.”

VISAKHAPATNAM: Three Telugu Yuvata leaders, including Greater Visakha Urban TDP president Lodagala Krishna, were arrested by the city cops when the TDP leaders were trying to lodge a complaint at the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy and minister Botcha Satyanarayana .

The leaders told the media that the YSRC’s decision of having three capitals in the state would do nothing but create unrest between the regions and castes, and would also only benefit YSRC leaders.

Kolkata: The number of AC electric buses in Kolkata swelled to 80 on Wednesday, with the transport minister Suvendu Adhikari inaugurating 10 more vehicles.

The West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) plans to run only electric buses, after phasing out the existing diesel-run vehicles.

While most of the new buses will ply existing routes of AC12 and AC23A, a new route, from Howrah Station to Salt Lake’s Karunamoyee (AC59A) was also introduced. “Electric buses will reduce the carbon footprint of WBTC, which serves the Kolkata metropolitan area. We aim to be a zero-emission corporation by 2030,” said a senior WBTC officer, adding the plan was to have an entire fleet of 5,000 electric buses in a decade.

With the e-buses replacing the old, fume-spewing vehicles, the carbon dioxide emission will be cut down by 7,82,560 tonnes a year. But the shift would be gradual, said a senior transport official. A total of 100 new e-buses are being bought for Haldia and Durgapur-Asansol and the government is ready to set up 241 charging stations in Kolkata. New Town, which also houses a booming IT hub, already has a fleet of e-buses and the number will go up to 50.

“The state has got approval for another 150 electric buses under the Fame II scheme,” an official said. All depots of West Bengal Transport Corporation at Tollygunge, Kidderpore, Kasba, Gariahat, Park Circus, Rajabazar, Lake Gardens, Belgachia, Nabanna and Santragachi, have been provided with charging infrastructure. Some private organisations are also setting up facilities for charging in the city.

The transport department on Wednesday also granted sanction letters to 1,500 beneficiaries under Gatidhara scheme and distributed 10 trauma-care ambulances to different organisations under road safety programme. The Howrah City Police got 10 motorcycles and CCTV cameras for traffic management. Two long-distance permits for AC buses, one from Santragachi to Patna and the other from Contai to Puri, were also given.

Jaipur: The revenue board has stayed the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA)’s recently proposed housing scheme, Shiv enclave in Zone-8, which was receiving tremendous response from residents.

The civic body had launched the scheme in December 2019 and invited applications to allot a total of 346 plots. The last date of submitting applications is 25 January. The scheme will be developed on the land of village Ganpatpura on at Goliyavas Circle near Prithviraj Nagar.

Savli MLA Ketan Inamdar

VADODARA: Savli MLA Ketan Inamdar may have grabbed headlines by tendering his resignation as an MLA on Wednesday, but this is not the first time that he has gone against the party. He is a known rebel who has contested twice against party candidates.

Also, Inamdar has expressed displeasure over the state of affairs earlier too. In June 2018, he had gone into a huddle with Raopura BJP MLA Yogesh Patel and Waghodiya BJP MLA Madhu Shrivastava over similar issues. He had then rued that MLAs were not respected by officials who dilly-dallied with works suggested by legislators

Notably, Patel was subsequently made a minister and Shrivastava was made the chairman of the Gujarat Agro Industries Corporation. Inamdar did not find favour for a post at that stage and was left sulking.

Inamdar began his political career by contesting gram panchayat polls that are not contested on party banners. An independent candidate initially, he later contested that district panchayat polls in 2005 on a BJP ticket but was not successful. He was suspended from the party later due to indiscipline, but joined it again in 2009. This stint with the BJP too proved short

Inamdar was denied a district panchayat election ticket in 2010 and contested as an independent. Many believed that Inamdar was a strong candidate despite his shortcomings and deserved a district panchayat ticket. He proved them right and won the polls. Once again, he joined the party in 2011.

But when he was denied at ticket for the 2012 assembly polls, he rebelled again and contested as an independent. He was the only independent who was successful in the polls in the state. He joined the party again after winning the polls and has remained with it since then.

He won the 2017 assembly polls from the BJP.

According to top party sources, Rupani and Vaghani have called Inamdar to meet them in Gandhinagar on Thursday. They have reportedly also asked him to refrain from speaking with media persons.

Amit Chavda, state Congress president said, “BJP MLAs are clearly frustrated with the functioning of their own government. Inamdar is only the beginning. Many many more senior MLAs and BJP leaders are also fed up of the government’s misrule”.

Catholic Church to hold public meet against CAA NRC and NPR

PANAJI: The Council of Social Justice and Peace (CSJP), which is the social work wing of the Catholic Church , will protest the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) at a public meting at Lohia Maidan, Margao, on Friday. The group will be joined by the National Confederation for Human Rights (Goa unit) and Concerned Citizens for Democracy.

“It is our common conviction that these measures are unconstitutional and, therefore unacceptable. The government must listen to the voice of the people and withdraw the Act. It can then engage in wide consultation if it still wishes to proceed with any form of legislation regarding citizenship,” CSJP’s executive secretary Fr Savio Fernandes told reporters at Margao on Wednesday. He said the government should also take note that this is the first time since the Partition that people across the country have demonstrated an unyielding show of unity to register their protests on the streets.

Educationist Prabhakar Timble and social activists Oscar Rebelo, Rama Kankonkar, Muzafar Shaikh are scheduled to speak at the Margao rally.

The council has stated that the government is resorting to the abuse of law and order mechanisms and intelligence agencies to suppress this people’s movement. “We have noticed how, in many parts of the country, the government has been high-handed in undermining the protests. It has unleashed violence and adopted intimidating tactics against peaceful protesters. Here in Goa, conceding to threats by a fringe group, permission granted to citizens of Mapusa for a peaceful protest was revoked on flimsy grounds,” Fernandes said.

“It is unlawful to disenfranchise genuine citizens whose legal rights to stay in this country cannot be challenged. In view of this vicious and deceitful method of de-citizenising millions of people, must not only reject the proposed NPR process but refuse to cooperate,” he added.

299,['23/01/2020'],Tamil Nadu government empowers more officials to check bonded labour system,"This story is from January 23, 2020

CHENNAI: After framing a standard operating procedure ( SOP ) to identify, rescue and rehabilitate bonded labourers, the state government has taken yet another progressive step to check bonded labour in industries by empowering the directorate of industrial safety and health (DISH) to check for such practices during inspections on industrial premises.

The ministry of labour and employment has passed an order to this effect. Following the government order, the directorate has asked its officials to invoke the provisions of the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, during inspections. “The authorities have acted upon repeated pleas from the stakeholders,” said an official in the department of labour and employment.

The scheme, according to the department, is aimed at transparency in inspections by adopting computerised risk-assessment-based inspections and random allocation of inspection officers. It would be conducted once in two years in factories under high and medium risk categories, and once in five years in low-risk industries, said an official.

The team assigned for the task will check whether the industry complies with the provisions of 18 Acts including The Factories Act, 1948; The Minimum Wage Act, 1948, and The Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, and ensures safety and welfare of the workforce.

Now, the Bonded Labour Act has been added to the list. “This will go a long way in eradicating bonded labour. The standard operating procedure to deal with bonded labourers will also give the necessary push to end the menace in organised sectors,” said the source.

Officials from DISH have also attended special training programmes on bonded labourers and SOP in the first week of January. “Bonded labour prevails in many forms, from forced labour to denial of basic rights. We have explained to them in detail the indicators of bonded labour in organised sector. Most of the officials were under the impression that bonded labour exists only in unorganised sectors like brick kilns,” said an official.

“Once the team finds elements of bonded labour in industries, the SOP will come into play,” he added.

Going by the SOP, the district collector would form a multi-disciplinary team comprising police, revenue and labour department personnel along with two eye-witnesses. They would take further legal action and rehabilitate rescued labourers, said the official.

Kolkata: Mayor Firhad Hakim on Wednesday directed the civic electrical department to conduct a health study of all the lamp posts in the city and submit a report on the findings by next one month. The move came two days after a five-year-old boy was killed when an old lamp post broke in two and fell on him at Ekbalpore on Monday. Hakim also told his officials to cut off the wires that some cable TV operators had illegally bunched up on lamp posts, adding load to the structures and making them vulnerable.

Hakim said a borough-wise survey of the existing lamp posts should be carried out to find any fault in the structures. “I have asked senior KMC officials to conduct a detailed survey of the city’s lamp posts. If any lamp post anywhere in the city is found to bear extra load or structurally unsafe, it will be pulled down,” he said.

About the huge mess of cables being bunched up on lamp posts, he said, “Some cable operators have been flouting rules and using our lamp posts to string up their wires. This must stop. I have asked the KMC electrical department to snap all such wires ,” Hakim said.

According to a KMC electrical department official, the survey will focus on some essential facts: the age of the lamp posts, the state of maintenance and to what extent the cable wires have been damaging. “We will consider all such factors while conducting the survey. If need be, we will cut off cable wires, where they have become a threat to the lamp posts,” he said.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Six BTech and BCom students from the city have designed an app—Bhai—to reach out to men and women in distress, such as victims of accidents or someone stranded in an unsafe situation. By pressing the alert button of the pre-installed mobile application, the user’s location will be sent to the nearest police station within a 20-km radius and some trusted contacts will be alerted.

Explaining the app, its designers E Jeevan , an engineering graduate from Gayatri Vidya Parishad , and his friend BCom student Atchuta Shiva Shankar said that following instances of assaults on women, especially after the Disha incident in December, they started designing an app for the safety of women and men.

“The central idea of the app is to react, respond and rescue before damage is done. This will be useful for any individual who travels alone to new places and requires help. This app is also useful for anyone in case they meet with an accident or require medical attention in remote or unknown areas,” explained Jeevan, who also runs NGO ‘Bhai’ (Begging Hands Abolition in India) to rescue child beggars and enrol them in school.

Twenty-two-year-old Shiva Shankar, who conceptualised the app, said, “The app has been devised in such a way that basic details of the user such as name, age, residence will be registered while installing the app. Police can verify the profile of each user to check any fraudulent or hoax calls. In the future, we plan to update the app to differentiate between medical and non-medical alerts. We have also spoken to the city police commissioner about the app and he has been supportive.”

Others associated with the Bhai app include Aedidea Innovations, KSG Sarma, K Lohit Sai, A Praveen and K Umesh Chandra – all are students of Gayatri Vidya Parishad Engineering College , Kommandi.

They started climbing the hill from the Baner side and reached a small temple near the Biodiversity Park around 9.40am, the report states.

The complainant said that they took a few photographs and selfies at this spot and started walking ahead around 9.45am when she realized that a man was following them. Soon, the man charged at her, she stated. Before she could gather herself, he grabbed her gold chain. The woman held on to one end of her chain and tried to pull down the suspect by catching his hair but the suspect managed to push her away, the FIR stated.

According to the police, the man managed to snatch her gold chain weighing 110gms and ran downhill. The woman attempted to chase him for a distance.

When contacted, the complainant told TOI, “I meet my friend regularly near the school but this was the first time we decided to go for a walk on the hill. We climbed the hill and halted near the Biodiversity Park. There were a few people present at the spot. We decided to walk a little ahead to the small temple. While walking, I realized somebody was following us. My friend had walked a little ahead of me and just when I stopped, the man charged at me, pushed me and grabbed my chain. I decided to retaliate but he managed to snatch the chain and ran away towards the Baner-end.”

Sub-inspector Mohan Jadhav of Chatushrungi police station said, “We have noted down the suspect’s description as provided by the complainant and her friend. We suspect the man may be a criminal on record. We will soon arrest him.”

Patna: The Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) will construct a first-of-its-kind exclusive examination complex in Patna having the seating capacity of more than 25,000 examinees at a time. “It will be the biggest examination complex in the country,” said a senior BSEB official on Wednesday.

Equipped with CCTV cameras, cellphone jammers and webcasting facility to check unfair means, the examination complex will come up on a plot of 6.79 acre land near the Old Bypass, around 100 metres before the connecting road to Mahatma Gandhi Setu.

“The complex will have 44 halls with the seating capacity of 20,680 offline examinees. Besides, another premises will have 20 separate halls with a seating capacity of 4,400 online examinees. A total of 25,080 examinees can sit in all the halls at a time,” BSEB chairman Anand Kishor told CM Nitish Kumar while making a presentation about the proposed complex here on Wednesday.

“A police barrack for at least 52 police personnel will also be built up there to ensure 24X7 security in and around the examination premises. Moreover, the premises will have residential quarters for supporting employees,” Kishor said.

The BSEB chairman also informed the CM that the board has already got possession of 5.78 acre land and a proposal for transfer of another 1.11 acre has been sent to Patna district magistrate.

After reviewing the presentation, the CM told the BSEB officials that there would be no difficulty in transferring 1.11 acre land as it is ‘gairmazarua’. He said since a big pond is existing on the land, the BSEB should ensure its proper beautification during the construction of the examination premises.

The CM also suggested for construction of a pathway around the examination premises so that visitors can walk around it. He said the boundary wall of the complex should be so strong that there would be no chance of any irregularities during examinations.

Nitish asked the officials to ensure proper road connectivity and metro connectivity to the examination complex. He said officials of road construction department and building construction department would make an on-the-spot survey of alignment of proposed Patna metro and ensure its proper connectivity with the examination complex through a wide road.

309,['23/01/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Curbs on palm oil import will push up subsidy burden,"This story is from January 23, 2020

CHENNAI: The Centre pressuring traders not to import palm oil from Malaysia , world’s second largest producer of the commodity, is likely to increase Tamil Nadu’s food subsidy from March.

The state buys palm oil at Rs 90 per litre and supplies it through PDS shops at Rs 25 a litre by subsidising the commodity. It supplies pulses and other essential commodities also at subsidised rates with a view to keeping prices of essential commodities under check in the market. More than 35,000 PDS shops across the state supply about 1.5 crore litres of palm oil every month. The present contract for procurement of palm oil ends in February. “We will continue with the special PDS supplies and edible oil will be very much part of it, irrespective of the price hike of the commodity. We foresee a price rise on account of imports from Malaysia virtually coming to a halt. Palm oil from Indonesia is coming at a higher price. But that won’t deter us from supplying palm oil through PDS,” said a senior official.

The civil supplies corporation buys imported oil from a private supplier – chosen through an open tender in December for three months. Including 67.5% import duty, the procurement price is Rs 90 a litre. The consumption pattern varies from district to district. The poor in Tamil Nadu prefer to cook using palm oil and PDS shops have been supplying it for more than a decade. “The supply is maintained through periodical tenders. Whether it comes from Indonesia or Malaysia is not our concern. When fresh tenders are floated for future supplies, the rates could go up further depending on the price of Indonesian oil,” another official said.

A senior official in civil supplies corporation said they were looking at other alternatives for palm oil. “We have rice bran, sunflower and groundnut oils as alternatives. If need be, we will procure them,” said the official. The government has allocated Rs 6,000 crore food subsidy for the current financial year. Of this, subsidy for palm oil is roughly Rs 500 crore.

Vadodara: An official of the Singvad taluka panchayat in Dahod were held while accepting a bribe for clearing bills for making toilets in houses in villages in the taluka panchayat area under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM).

The toilets for the left-out beneficiaries in the taluka were to be made by Om Sai Mahila Mandal based in Pipaliya. The organisation had also signed a memorandum of understanding with the taluka panchayat to prepare 99 such toilets.

The organisation made 12 such toilets in a month’s time. It prepared a bill of Rs 1.2lakh that was submitted to the taluka panchayat. Supervisor and in-charge cluster coordinator (SBM) Chandrasinh Patel allegedly sought a bribe of Rs 11,000 to clear the bill.

The complainant was not willing to pay the bribe and approached the Dahod Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) with a complaint. ACB laid a trap to nab Chandrasinh and when the complainant went to give the bribe, Chandrasinh sought an additional Rs 500 for accounts assistant Haresh Patel.

The complainant gave Rs 11,500 as bribe to Chandrasinh who was nabbed red-handed while accepting the cash. Sleuths could not nab Haresh during the raid as he was not present at the spot where the bribe was accepted.

The carcass of the chip-tagged endangered black stork

JAIPUR: Around three months after a satellite-tagged black stork was found dead in Jaisalmer, Russian researchers are waiting to get back their instruments, which were attached to the bird.

The carcass of the endangered species, ringed and tagged by the Russian Raptor Research and Conservation Network (RRCN), was recovered by the Border Security Force (BSF) on October 23, 2019. The bird reportedly died after collision with a barbed wire fence near the border.

Sources said BSF on suspicion of it being an avian spy handed over the stork to local police along with the instruments, which in turn sent these to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL).

The bird was ringed by researcher Alexey Ebel. It was marked with the Ring RRRCN Moscow Russia 139 and the tracker of the Max Planck Institute 6633 as part of a project to study the migration path.

Dau Lal Bohra, who is associated with RRCN to study the migratory path, told TOI, “The black stork was marked as part of a project to study the migration of the Siberian stork. The tracker is the property of Tigirek Reserve. The Russian research centre has authorised that the tracker on the bird be handed over to me, so that I can send it back to Russia. I have written to the superintendent of police, Jaisalmer, and also met the local police in this regard. However, even after two months I am waiting to get the possession of the tracker.”

SP Jaisalmer, Kiran Kang, on the possibility of the tracker being returned, said, “As the bird was found in border district, the tracker recovered had to be sent to FSL, the report of which takes time. I will send a reminder, but at this point cannot confirm when the FSL report will be prepared.”

Researchers said the bird is protected under the agreement of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) on the international trade of endangered species of wild fauna and flora. Its population has witnessed continuous decline across Europe and Siberia. Elaborating further, Bohra said, “The bird is rarely spotted in Rajasthan as it needs a lot of water. Barmer-Jaisalmer is the passage for this bird to travel to Pakistan, Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan. It is crucial to recover the instrument as there is no fresh study or data on this bird.”

314,['23/01/2020'],"University campuses should not be used for political agitations, says UGC vice-chairman","This story is from January 23, 2020

COIMBATORE: University campuses should be used for academic purposes and not for political agitations, vice-chairman of the University Grants Commission Bhushan Patwardhan said here on Wednesday.

“Universities should not be converted into battlegrounds for any reason or ideology. When students come to university campuses, they should restrict themselves to academics. They are free to do whatever they want to do as citizens outside. It is their individual right,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the 33rd Biennial Conference of Home Science Association of India held at the Avinashilingam Institute for Home Science and Higher Education for Women in the city.

“If students are given a better opportunity to connect with the community, they would be better placed and would not agitate. If students from urban areas stay with farmers for a month, they will never agitate,” Patwardhan said.

Speaking of new reforms in higher education, the academician said the UGC has finalised two new programmes in the idea-level National academic credit bank and semester outreach programme.

The national academic credit bank will allow students to earn credits from any course at any university across the country or even abroad. “Universities should decide how many credits are needed for degree and how many of these credits need to be from that university to get the degree of that university. Students can earn the remaining credits from any course in institutions in the country or even abroad. There would be a mechanism to process the credits,” he said. “This would enable a multi-disciplinary approach and liberate students towards a multiple-entry multiple-exit process.”

The UGC would implement it in a pilot scale either with only postgraduate-level courses or with a new liberal education programme or selected universities.

Under the semester outreach programme, students will be sent outside the campus to get experiential learning from various sectors, such as banking, agriculture and community work. “While such activities are now being done as NCC and NSS programmes or as extra-curricular activities, we seek to make it a structured credit-based course,” Patwardhan said.

The UGC has formed teams to frame regulations for the programmes and it would be finalised in six months. “These programmes are challenging to construct and implement. But these will not be made compulsory.”

A one-month structured residential programme will be made mandatory for teachers. They should complete the course within six months of joining. UGC is also framing learning outcome-based curriculum for various verticals.

The three-day conference on ‘Trends for Futuristic Development in Home Science: Research and Innovation’ was inaugurated on Wednesday at the institute. As many as 200 faculty members and 400 students from various institutions across the country are attending the event.

Satender Tiwari had to undergo a surgery after suffering a critical neck injury from nylon manja

NAGPUR: Bank manager Satender Tiwari, 32, was on his way to work. Shraddha Shende, 24, was returning home after giving an entrance exam for bank recruitment . Out of nowhere, a sharp kite manja slashed their necks, drenching their clothes in blood within seconds.

This year too, the Makar Sankranti festival turned bleak for many citizens who fell victim to the continued persistent use of nylon manja. Satyendra and Shraddha had a miraculous escape despite being critically injured.

After being discharged from hospital, the victims recounted their close shave with TOI.

Satender, who met with the accident on January 15 and came home three days back, says that the manja ripped off his leather jacket first and then slit his neck. “I had just crossed Manewada Square on my two-wheeler when I spotted a loose kite coming in my direction. I was focusing on avoiding it when suddenly I felt a strong force pulling me back,” he says.

The pain that Satender felt was past bearing. He stopped driving to check in the rear view mirror. “I was bleeding profusely so much that the blood entered my shoes in no time. Balancing the vehicle with my right hand, I made an attempt to remove the manja with the left one. But it was so sharp that my thumb got a deep cut,” he says.

Satender was rushed to a nearby hospital. “The doctors gave me first-aid but they informed that the cut was very severe and I needed immediate surgery. I was then taken to Orange City Hospital and Research Institute,” he adds.

When Satender returned home three days back, he was shocked to see a long deep cut on the collar of his leather jacket. “It’s frightening to imagine how sharp the manja was. It can’t be a cotton one,” he says, expressing resentment over nylon manja being sold and used despite the ban.

“Apart from the manufacturers and sellers, strict action should be taken against the users of the killer thread who put so many lives at stake every year. Immense awareness is needed,” adds Satender.

Shraddha’s family shares the same sentiment. “People who continue to use sharp-edged manja despite so many deaths and accidents should know that tomorrow someone close to them can also suffer. Thinking that such unfortunate things happen only to others is wrong. I never thought I would see my daughter soaked in blood,” says her mother.

Like Satender, Shraddha too was wearing a helmet and had wrapped a scarf around her neck. But in vain. “Tearing her scarf, the manja slit her throat. She was bleeding profusely,” her mother adds.

Shraddha was returning home from the examination centre with three friends when the incident took place near Katol Road on January 19. She was rushed to Suretech Hospital where she underwent a surgery. Now back home, she is still unable to talk due to unbearable pain. “She is not even able to tell us how she fared in her exam,” her mother says.

NEW DELHI: Over 300 flights were delayed and at least five flights were diverted at Indira Gandhi International Airport in the early hours on Wednesday after dense fog enveloped the capital.Visibility remained in the range of 0-50 metres for at least seven hours between 3.30 am and 10.30 am, during which five flights were diverted to Jaipur and Amritsar as the pilots were not CAT-III compliant, airport officials said. Among the flights diverted were three international flights and two domestic flights.Things became even more difficult with airspace closure of 105 minutes, which has been mandated for seven days on January 18, 20-24 and 26 due to the Republic Day celebrations. Airspace closure occurred between 10.35 am and 12:15 pm, with the ripple effect occurring in terms of flight delays through the day.Trains too were impacted by the fog, with at least 22 trains delayed in the morning, Northern Railway officials said.Given that airspace over Delhi usually remains closed for 105 minutes daily in the window of January 18-26 due to the Republic Day flypast, most airlines tend to schedule their plans in advance.According to a notice to airmen (NOTAM), which was issued by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) last week, “No landing and take off would be permitted at Delhi International Airport between 10.35 am and 12.15 pm on January 18, 20-24 and 26, due to the Republic Day celebrations”.RK Jenamani, scientist at the National Weather Forecasting Centre, said this was the third worst ‘dense fog’ spell this season in terms of both the intensity and the duration, after the spells of December 20 and 30, 2019. “CAT-III conditions prevailed for around seven hours till 10.30 am, with visibility hovering in the range of 0-50 metres,” said Jenamani.According to him, while the dense fog on December 20 lasted nearly nine hours, the spell on December 30 lasted close to 10 hours.Airlines also took to Twitter, informing passengers of the possible delays. Vistara tweeted: “Due to poor visibility in Delhi today morning, arrivals/departures from Delhi may get impacted throughout the day with consequential impact across the network. Please visit the website.”“Tough travel day for all of us due to dense fog in the northern region this morning and airspace closure in lieu of the Republic Day preparations. This has caused disruptions to several flights across the network. We’re doing our best to recover, however, there will be consequential delays throughout the day. Do keep a track of your flights through our website,” stated IndiGo.A few passengers who were stuck at the airports for hours also took to Twitter to vent their ire. “Stuck at Abu Dhabi airport since flight from Delhi EY 211 was delayed.. no support in providing connecting flight to Athens as that was missed because of the delay.

PUNE: Residents of Uruli and Phursunsgi are unhappy with the civic body for keeping garbage for treatment at a waste processing plant near its trash depot.

Members of citizens’ group Garbage Depot Sangharsh Samiti visited the area on Tuesday and complained about trash piling up at the processing unit site.

Bhagwan Bhadale, a resident of Uruli Devachi and member of the citizens’ group, said keeping the garbage at the processing site contradicted the Pune Municipal Corporation ’s (PMC) claim of completely stopping open dumping of the garbage in the area.

“The PMC is still bringing garbage in the area. We do not want any garbage reaching Uruli and Phursungi,” he said.

Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of the PMC’s solid waste management department, said the administration was not dumping garbage at the Uruli depot from January 15.

“The garbage is now being transported to the bio-mining processing unit site, located next to the trash depot. We are producing refuse-derived fuel and manure by processing about 400 tonnes of garbage at the site,” he said.

“Processing of garbage at the bio-mining site is also a temporary measure. Once the new processing units start functioning, garbage will no more be transported to the shed in Uruli,” Molak said.

“For vehicles that fall in ditches or on roadside which require to be lifted out, the RASTA van is equipped to do so fitted with ropes, ladder, lights and axe that come handy in such rescue operations. It also has tools to break window panes or breaking open doors. This way we don’t have to wait for the rescue operations by other departments,” Gahlaut told TOI.

The van, which will have a police sub-inspector and two constables, will also have stretcher, a first aid box and other necessary objects to help victims. “With the rise in vehicle density, accidents have become a regular affair. Such a special van is the need of the hour to save as many lives as possible,” a police official said.

In 2019, 148 fatal and 292 grievous accidents took place in the city.

The cops have also been trained to conduct rescue operations and will also start investigating serious accidents like crime scene investigations to ascertain the exact reason.

Every detail of the accident along with the time, reason behind the accident, vehicles involved and exact spot is fed in a special software and the data is then used to make roads safer through effective deployment of traffic cops at key spots.

Jaipur: In Pratap Nagar’s double murder case, the city police have claimed that it will take a month before the chargesheet can be filed against the two accused as the FSL report is still awaited. The two accused are in judicial custody till January 28. The cops claimed to have enough digital and circumstantial evidence against the accused husband, who hired a contract killer to murder his wife and infant child.

Rohit Tiwari hired Saurabh Chaudhary to kill his wife Shweta and son Shreyam. The mother-son duo were murdered on January 7 and both the accused arrested three days later.

Commissioner of Police, Jaipur, Anand Shrivastav talking about the investigation said, “We have sufficient digital evidence against Rohit including phone call and messages between the two accused. We are waiting for the FSL report and the charge-sheet will take at least a month to be prepared. We are covering all aspects in the case so as not leave any loopholes.”

Tiwari, who hails from Delhi, had planned the gruesome killings along with Chaudhary, who was paid an advance of Rs 20,000 to execute the crime. The husband had conspired to kill his wife and son as he wanted to “delete his back history” to get married again. Shweta, who hails from Kanpur, and the infant were bludgeoned to death by the hired killer.

During the questioning it was found that Rohit and Saurabh both had turbulent marital lives which were a common grievance for the two. Saurabh’s pregnant wife was living away from him in Agra due to marital issues and Rohit was also unhappy with his married life. It appears that the two made a pact to kill each other's wives as was found by the cops. While Rohit was sent to judicial custody on January 15, Saurabh was sent to jail two days later.

322,['23/01/2020'],Maharashtra: Tech glitch hits registration of leave &amp; licence agreements,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Illustration used for representational purpose

PUNE: The state registration department has failed to complete e-registration of over 10,000 leave and licence agreements in the past three days and has blamed the situation on “technical snags” related to non-linking of Aadhaar data with the Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ) server.

The state has 500 Authorized Service Providers (ASP) for the online registration of leave and licence agreements for properties. However, people from Maharashtra and other states approaching the ASPs for this online registration were made to wait endlessly with the property registration office failing to specify any timeframe to rectify the snag.

An ASP member in Pune said a couple from Rajasthan were forced to stay in a hotel here for the past three days as their registration work was not done because of the server snag. “They had booked their return tickets. But with no sign of their agreement papers getting ready, they are not sure how long they will have to stay back in Pune,” he said.

Another ASP member cited an example of a couple from Hyderabad, who had reached Mumbai to get the registration done and wanted to return the following day. The couple had to cancel their flight tickets because the work was not done.

“It’s a harrowing time for both ASPs and citizens trying to get their leave and licence agreements registered online. Online registration of the documents is not possible when there is no UIDAI server connectivity. Worse, nobody is owning up for the situation. The ASPs have been contacting the Inspector General of Registration’s office and the IT department in Mantralaya but there has been no response,” an ASP member said.

Deputy Inspector General of Registration (IT) P Ahirrao told TOI that the technical glitch was not related to his department. “It’s a problem with the UIDAI. We had sent them a mail on the issue and they replied that they were looking into the issue. We are writing to them daily now. We have to wait for them to rectify the snag,” he said.

An ASP member said, “Such snags are frequent. There should be a nodal officer to coordinate between agencies involved in the registration process and resolve issues at the earliest. Citizens should not be made to suffer.”

From last year, the state government’s department of registration and stamps began allowing registration of residential leave and licence agreements from home through the ASPs. The process requires registration of necessary documents, biometric prints and Aadhaar numbers through the ASPs at their offices or at a citizen’s home. A citizen has to pay Rs1,000 for registration at doorstep and Rs700 if the work is done at an ASP’s office.

The online registration of leave and licence agreements had prompted more people to opt for the formal registration of properties on rent without visiting the sub-registrar’s office. The earlier registration process needed two witnesses.

VISAKHAPATNAM: With the Port City assuming the status of executive capital, auto sales in the city are expected to rise in the near future.

Luxury automobile manufacturer Mercedes-Benz opened its flagship store at Mindi , near Gajuwaka on Tuesday, a day after the capital bills were tabled in the Assembly. The German auto company Audi had opened its showroom in the city in 2014.

Martin Schwenk, MD and CEO of Mercedes-Benz India Private Limited, said, “We will keep every model in the city, on par with metros such as New Delhi and Mumbai. Also, we are looking forward to introduce our new electric vehicle in the city once the product is launched after April this year.”

Speaking to TOI, Schwenk said the status of executive capital would be a boon for the luxury automobile market in the city, adding that professionals and realtors would be among the company’s targeted customers.

Managing director of Laxmi Gayatri Hospital, Dr KV Ramkumar, owner of a luxury car, said such cars require maintenance fewer times compared to other cars. “Only once a year do we have to send in a luxury car for service, against every 5,000 km for other cars,” he said.

Speaking to TOI, deputy transport commissioner of the Road Transport Authority (RTA), GC Raja Ratnam said there is an increasing demand for luxury cars and motorbikes in the city, which is expectd to further rise.

RTA sources said that currently, only one triple-digit number for a luxury car is registered in the city, but they expect more such number plates once the executive capital shifts to the city.

Panaji: One of the three offshore casino operators has sought permission from the state government to replace an existing vessel with a larger ship, a proposal that the ports department is still considering, said minister for ports Michael Lobo.

“There is a move, we have received an application to replace one casino vessel with another one. It is under consideration,” Lobo said.

Lobo also said that chief minister Pramod Sawant needs to finalise the gaming commission in order to bring transparency to the gambling sector.

“Lot of debates have taken place during the last five-year tenure, and in these three years as well. The gaming commission has to fall in place. I feel that the chief minister should take it up after the budget session,” Lobo said.

The ministeralso said that Goa needs the casino policy to be put in place in order to pave the way for the offshore casinos to be gradually shifted to onshore. Lobo did say that the state government’s first focus is on restarting the mining sector.

“The day mining starts, CM will start thinking about the casino policy. Otherwise people will say that the chief minister is framing policies for casinos and not for mining and mining dependent people. After mining, he will take up this issue which is of importance for tourism also,” said Lobo.

The minister said casino owners suggested that a time-frame should be laid down for offshore casinos to shift to land, but on the condition that live gaming licences are issued, which former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had agreed to.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Dehu Road Cantonment Board (DCB) has got the ministry of defence (MoD) approval for reclassification of land, a first in 60 years, to facilitate construction of a school building.

The need for the school arose after the building housing a school in Shelarwadi, which was started in 1960, was demolished a year ago after its structural audit. “Around 120 students of this school were then shifted to a school in the MB Camp area,” R Haritwal, DCB chief executive officer, said.

“This building was located on ‘A2’ defence land, where any kind of construction is barred,” he said, adding, “The cantonment has also sent a proposal to construct a new school building at an estimated cost of Rs 1.7 crore.”

CHENNAI: Continuing the crackdown on suspected Islamic State sympathisers in the wake of the gunning down of sub-inspector Wilson on January 8, the Tamil Nadu police on Wednesday arrested three men, two of them Hindus who converted to Islam, at Devipattinam near Ramanathapuram . A fourth person, who police suspect transferred cash to Wilson’s killers, escaped the police net.

The three arrested, Mohammad Ameer alias Arunkumar, 31, a native of Villupuram, Mohammad Ali alias Manikandan 28, a native of Cuddalore, and Pitchai Kani alias Pura Kani, 45, a native of Keezhakarai , were remanded in prison by a magistrate court at Devipattinam.

Ramanathapuram district superintendent of police R V Varunkumar said, “We had a tip-off about the trio moving from hideout to hideout in the district. Police tracked their movements and apprehended them.”

Investigators say Kani indoctrinated and converted Manikandan and Arunkumar to Islam three or four years ago. Later, police said, they were radicalised by the man who escaped, Shaik Dawood. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had arrested Dawood in 2018 on charging of converting and radicalising youngsters from poor backgrounds. He came out on bail and went underground and was involved in funding radical elements, police said.

Wednesday’s police operation was led by deputy superintendent of police Velladurai, and special branch sub-inspectors Dhebakar, Senthilkumar and Jesudoss. Officers refused to divulge details of the three suspects activities, which appeared to centred around funding radicals.

As part of the statewide crackdown, the Chennai city police had on Tuesday conducted checks at the lodges and mansions at Periamet and nearby areas. The raids was based on information revealed during the interrogation of Khaja Moideen, main accused in the July 2014 murder of Hindu Munnani leader Suresh Kumar at Ambattur . Moideen had jumped bail along with two other accused, Navas and Abdul Shameem, one of Wilson’s killers. Moideen and Navas were caught along with another man by the Delhi police. In fact, investigators believe it is the news of their arrest on January 8 that enraged Shameem and Toufiq, who killed Wilson later that night.

PANAJI: With the University Grants Commission (UGC) stepping back as a major funding agency for research projects by university and college teachers, the state directorate of higher education (DHE) is set to form research, development and innovation cells in all 33 government and aided colleges in Goa. Through these cells, college faculty will be motivated and trained to pursue proposals for funding of their small research projects with central government agencies.

The research cells will help develop and coordinate strategies to maximise the faculty’s success in gaining external research funding.

An umbrella initiative, ‘research, development and innovation cell’, has already been formed in the DHE and is headed by astronomer Vithal Tilvi, who has worked with NASA.

“Though the UGC has stopped funding research in a big way, every central government department has provision for funds for research projects. Most of these funds remain unutilised. College teachers require training on how to effectively write research proposals to be able to bag the funds. The research, development and innovation cell will provide this training and motivation,” a DHE official said.

In each college, a faculty member oriented towards research will be chosen to head the cell. Teachers will subsequently be coached to submit proposals for projects that can be accomplished with financial aid of Rs 5-10 lakh.

“Taking on these projects will help promote the teachers’ personal growth as they will be able to pursue research in varied subjects of their interest. It will also help their careers to progress in terms of promotions, etc. The exposure teachers get will benefit their students as well. It will boost innovation in institutions of higher education,” the official said.

The DHE’s research, development and innovation cell already has 60 teachers involved in writing research proposals.

Panaji: The state government would seek the advocate general’s opinion before deciding on the Lokayukta’s recommendation to initiate a CBI inquiry against former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar and two other officials for renewing iron ore mining leases for a second time.

The second renewal of the leases were subsequently quashed by the Supreme Court in February 2018, bringing all mining activity in the state to a grinding halt.

“The Lokayukta report has reached me today, and I have not read it as yet. I will go through it and take the AG’s recommendation,” said chief minister Pramod Sawant.

The Goa Lokayukta Justice P K Misra recommended a CBI inquiry against Parsekar, who is a senior BJP leader in Goa, and two other officials for renewing the mining leases. Misra in his report said that there was enough evidence to suggest that the public functionaries had committed criminal offences.

“It is a recommendatory report which has been sent to the government. It is not compulsory that the government is bound to act,” said Sawant when asked about his stance on the Lokayukta’s recommendations.

He also appeared optimistic of mining activity resuming in the state with a positive outcome expected from the review petition that the Supreme Court is hearing. Sawant said that the Lokayukta’s report would not undermine Goa’s interests in the apex court hearings.

Industries minister Vishwajit Rane said the chief minister has prioritised resumption of mining. “CM is very hopeful that before March 31 we will be able to find some sort of way out,” said Rane.

JAIPUR: The state IT department is working on amalgamation of ration card with the Jan Aadhaar card . The ration card is all set to be revised and the state government has decided to introduce smart ration cards in the state.

The state government had already taken a decision to replace the Bhamashah card introduced by the previous BJP government under the direct transfer of benefits with the Jan Aadhaar card. Now government is planning to merge the ration card with the Jan Aadhaar, so it will save money and a single card will serve both the purposes. A single card for all benefits is the idea.

Jan Aadhaar card is meant for the direct transfer of benefits of government schemes to the account of the beneficiary. Officials privy to the development said most of those who are beneficiaries of the PDS and National Food Security Act also come under the same category of beneficiaries.

Besides, both Jan Aadhaar card and ration cards are issued treating each family as the unit. So, there is no point in duplication. “A single card that will cater to all the benefits of government schemes makes sense which would not only reduce the administrative cost but also the investment required,” said an official.

PUNE: Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Wednesday demanded the resignation of Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman .

He said the country’s economy was in a poor state, the growth rate has gone down and the IMF's forecast for the country is a worry. “The low GDP reflected the Union government’s failure and Sitharaman should resign as she has lost the confidence of the Prime Minister's Office,” he added.

Addressing a news conference on Wednesday, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah are deciding about finance matters.

Pre-Budget meetings are being conducted at the Prime Minister’s Office without Sitharaman and interactions with leading industrialists were carried out in her absence, Chavan said.

Chavan claimed that Modi had conducted 13 pre-Budget meetings and none were attended by Sitharaman.

“Traditionally, the pre-budget meetings are held at the finance ministry under the supervision of the finance minister. But these meetings are held at the PMO office. It may be a testimony of the loss of trust in the finance minister and her style of functioning,” he said.

The former chief minister said he stood by his comment about the Sena wanting a tie-up with the Congrees in 2014.

On the 24x7 night life initiative, Chavan said before implementing the concept in Pune, it should be tested in Mumbai.

NEW DELHI: A 57-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide at her residence in Lutyens’ Delhi on Monday afternoon. The body of Natasha Kapur, the wife of the joint president of Atlas Cycles, was reportedly found hanging from the ceiling fan at her house in Aurangzeb Lane by her family members. Her husband, Sanjay, was not at home at the time.

In a suicide note purportedly written by Kapur, she said that she loved her children and asked them to take care of themselves and Sanjay.

The incident was reported to police around 2.30pm. Kapur’s son, Sidhanth, told police that he had called her several times to ask her to come down to the dining hall for lunch. When she didn’t respond, he went up to her first floor room to check. He found the door partially open and entered. He then went to the bathroom and found her body hanging from the ceiling fan with a piece of cloth. He cut the cloth, brought down the body and carried it to the bedroom.

Sidhanth then informed the other family members and police. Kapur was taken to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital where she was declared dead. The autopsy was conducted at RML Hospital on Wednesday afternoon after which the body was handed over to the family members.

DCP (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said that inquest proceedings have been initiated to find out the reason behind the alleged suicide. A forensic team would be verifying the handwriting and content of the note. It is also being probed whether she suffered from depression.

Police have recovered her mobile phone from which she had sent some messages to a number asking for money transfer the same day.

Pune: City-based commercial vehicle and engine maker Force Motors has invested Rs 1,000 crore over the last four years to develop a new platform for its next generation of BS-VI commercial as well as electric vehicles.

“The platform has been built to enter more sophisticated markets where the regulations are more stringent... the existing platforms will also continue,” Abhay Firodia, chairman, Force Motors, said.

Prasan Firodia, managing director, Force Motors, said the company’s aspiration was to get significantly into the global markets with this “modular platform” and bring more vehicles on the platform in the future.

The vehicles will be launched on the platform by the end of the year, when the company will reveal the technical specifications and the pricing.

The company said it would target markets in the middle east, Africa, ASEAN and South America, besides India.

Auto slowdown temporary

The current slowdown in the auto sector was temporary and should settle in another three quarters, Abhay Firodia said, adding that the sudden change from the BS-IV to BS-VI regime, lack of financing options due to the NBFC crisis were the main reasons why customer interest was not getting converted into sales.

“I must admit that the government is doing a lot of things right, but it should not be doing business and leave it to industry to do it. For example, they should sell their stakes in the public sector banks and bring that money to help the industry prosper,” he said.

There will obviously be opposition, he said, from the trade unions and others who would try and protect their comfort zone. “But why should the government protect the non-performers,” he asked, while citing the example of Air India.

HYDERABAD: As India battles to find a solution to ensure birth of female calves through artificial insemination to fix the skewed sex ratio in cattle, Telangana has surged ahead by topping the charts in the country in using the method for milching animals.While other states are slowly catching up with the method, Telangana is a trailblazer with 2,26,366 calves born under this method. Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh trails far behind (in a distant 10th place) with just 74,667 cattle.Though officials claim it is the way forward, this method using ‘sexed semen’ (sex-sorted semen) technology is mostly used to help in increasing milk production, which is key to farmers’ income as they depend on dairy operations to supplement their farm earnings.The programme, which is meant to cover 1.2 crore cows, was launched by PM Narendra Modi and nearly 17 lakh inseminations have already been done. Unlike the 50:50 chances of male-female calf in normal conventional semen, chances of having a female calf would be close to 80-90% with the use of sex-sorted semen, experts say.Unlike the non-sexed semen which is freely available to farmers, the cost of sexed semen ranges between Rs 700 and Rs 1,200 per dose. The Telangana government has set up a centre in Karimnagar to produce sexed semen.With farmers likely to use three doses to have a female calf, experts pointed out that the high costs could be a spoiler for small and marginal farmers. However, government officials said farmers would get the semen doses at subsidised rates. Apart from Telangana, semen production stations are located in Haryana, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Uttarakhand. Experts said there is a need for controlled population with high quality genetic potential to be bred at semen production stations. “We need to develop indigenous technology for semen-sexing. We also need to look at disease resistance and feed efficiency in cattle,” an expert said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73540244,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-295849,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-leads-in-artificial-insemination-of-cattle-in-india/articleshow/73530251.cms
337,['23/01/2020'],"Despite gag, MLA Renukacharya continues rant against Muslims","This story is from January 23, 2020

Mangaluru/Bengaluru: A day after two senior functionaries of the BJP — a deputy chief minister and a political secretary to the chief minister — made provocative speeches against a minority community, Nalin Kumar Kateel , state president of the saffron party, on Wednesday issued a gag order, banning functionaries from talking on issues without the party’s approval.

Deputy CM Govind Karjol and Honnalli legislator MP Renukacharya had passed comments castigating Muslims, in the process seriously denting the image of the party which is trying to avoid controversies in its efforts to allay fears on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The comments come on the heels of Ballari City legislator Somashekara Reddy warning Muslims at a pro-CAA rally of repercussions if they do not fall in line.

Kateel told TOI a gag order has been “clearly” communicated to all concerned at a recent meeting that he and chief minister BS Yediyurappa had chaired. “Our message to party functionaries is in line with what Prime Minister Narendra Modi has told his council of ministers and party MPs — to focus on their work and constituencies rather than comment on issues. Let them leave this task to official spokespersons of the party,” Kateel said.

However, it appears the message hasn’t gone through to Renukacharya, Yediyurappa’s political secretary. A day after courting controversy by saying anti-nationals were using mosques to store weapons, Renukacharya said he stood by his comments and launched a fresh tirade against madrasas, saying they were manipulating youth and encouraging terrorism.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Renukacharya said: “In our [temple-run] institutions, nothing anti-national is taught. We only teach values that are mandated for life. But at madrasas, youth are manipulated by teaching terrorism. Why do we need such schools? The majority of those accused of terrorism are Muslims.”

He immediately followed up this comment by saying he did not imply all Muslims were terrorists. The Honnalli MLA justified his comments saying he did not receive a single Muslim vote in the 2018 assembly elections. “They [Muslims] come to us seeking our help. They want the BJP for development, but when it comes to elections, they vote for Congress and JD(S),” Renukacharya said. He said no “special packages” will be distributed to Muslims in his constituency.

PATNA: Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Wednesday came out in defence of CM Nitish Kumar , who is currently facing continuous attacks from two senior JD(U) colleagues — national vice-president Prashant Kishor and former parliamentarian Pavan Varma . He described Nitish as a person often exploited by the very people who benefited from his “large-heartedness”.In a tweet, SuMo said, “He (Nitish) gave his chair to someone (a reference to Jitan Ram Manjhi), made many members of Rajya Sabha (Pavan Varma) and lifted many people from non-political corridors and gave them higher position in the organization (Kishor). However, some of those people have not refrained from being ‘thankless’. Not everything is always justified even in politics.”The deputy CM’s observations come a day after Varma wrote a letter to Nitish, expressing his “perplexity” over JD(U)’s decision to form an alliance with BJP for the Delhi assembly election.In another tweet, SuMo said BJP and JD(U) were doing the groundwork to extend their alliance beyond Bihar. “The two-decade alliance between BJP and JD(U) is unbreakable and our government is working together for growth of 12 crore people in Bihar. We are making ground for working together outside Bihar as well and those having ‘excruciating pain’ due to this, are trying to find excuses to break the alliance,” he tweeted.Hours before SuMo’s scathing comments, Kishor, ignoring JD(U)’s steadfast support to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), put out a tweet, challenging Union home minister Amit Shah to implement CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the same “chronology” that he “audaciously announced” to the nation in Lucknow a day earlier.Kishor said, “Being dismissive of citizens’ dissent couldn’t be the sign of strength of any government. @amitshah Ji, if you don’t care for those protesting against #CAA_NRC, why don’t you go ahead and try implementing the CAA & NRC in the chronology that you so audaciously announced to the nation!”His tweet evoked sharp reactions from the state BJP. “Kishor’s comment on Shah is shameful, indecent and intolerable. He has even been making statements against the decisions taken by the top leadership of his own party,” state BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said. “Kishor doesn’t have the ability to win a mukhiya or a sarpanch’s election. Even then he seems to regard himself as a leader bigger than CM Nitish Kumar,” Anand added.Many in Bihar political circles claimed Nitish had inducted Kishor into JD (U) in September, 2018, on the “advice” of Shah.JD(U) sources indicated that the party might soon take “disciplinary action” against Kishor and Varma. “Our leadership has initiated the necessary process… Wait till tomorrow (Thursday),” a top JD(U) functionary said, wishing not to be named.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73537401,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-737019,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sumo-bjp-stand-by-nitish-under-fire-from-pavan-pk/articleshow/73530291.cms

NEW DELHI: Life turned topsy-turvy for a businessman based in south Delhi after crooks not only carried out fraudulent transactions from his credit card, but also sent him objectionable pictures of him and his friend stored on his Google drive.

The accused also blackmailed him with morphed pictures of his family members, asking him to transfer Rs 1 lakh to an anonymous account to not put the pictures online. Three men, including the mastermind, have been arrested using the IP details of the devices of the accused provided by Google.

“The accused are Deepak alias Bittoo (19), Mohammad Ali (19) and Sanchit Saraswat (20). Ali is the mastermind of the gang and has earlier worked in a call centre,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, DCP (South).

Police said that Ali and Deepak were friends. The duo approached their third friend Saraswat who worked as a team leader with a firm. For just Rs 500, Saraswat allegedly provided an excel sheet with confidential data including credit card details, names and mobile numbers of people. The duo procured mobile numbers on fake addresses and started their own ‘call centre’ at Deepak’s house in outer Delhi.

The duo then allegedly started calling people from the list, impersonating executives of their target’s bank. They would gain access to target’s bank accounts and emails using his mobile number and the OTP. “In the current case, the accused ordered a gold chain for Rs 25,000 through an e-commerce website using the businessman’s bank details. The order was frozen as soon as we received the complaint,” DCP Thakur said.

The accused then allegedly accessed the victim’s Google drive and started threatening him with morphed pictures. The businessman was asked to send Rs 1 lakh to not leak the pictures.

KIA airport

BENGALURU: In a bid to “decongest” air traffic in Bengaluru, the government has proposed to construct a greenfield airport in either Tumakuru or Kolar. With the chances of HAL airport, in the heart of the city, opening up to civil aviation looking “bleak”, the government is scouting for alternatives that are relatively close to Bengaluru.

Planning commission vice-chairman BJ Puttaswamy told reporters on Wednesday the infrastructure development department (IDD) has pencilled in Kolar and Tumakuru districts for the new airport.

“We had a meeting with officials of the department and efforts are being made to identify a location for the purpose. This is to circumvent possible saturation of air traffic in Bengaluru in the coming years,” Puttaswamy said.

Confirming the proposal, IDD officials said the whole process will take at least 10 years as identification of a suitable location and construction of a full-fledged airport “cannot be done overnight”.

“The intention is to create an alternative to the already burgeoning Kempegowda International Airport. But the process is a long-drawn affair and will take at least 10 years by which time the concessionaire agreement with BIAL will almost be at an end,” an official said.

Puttaswamy said the possibility of Kolar hosting the new airport is “slightly less” as it would be more beneficial to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh than Karnataka. IDD officials say Kolar does have a ready-made infrastructure with a World War II era airstrip which is currently being used by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for test flights. But an official admitted, “With the airstrip under the control of the MoD, it is difficult to construct a civilian airport in the district.”

Puttaswamy said the government plans to have 10 airports in the state — one for every three districts. He said new airports could come up in Gadag, Koppal, Kodagu and Chikkamagaluru districts.

Odisha Water Supply & Sewerage Board (OWSSB) is implementing the Rs 810.83 crore mega project to build a comprehensive sewerage system for collection and disposal of waste water.

The court has issued notice to the chief engineer, OWSSB and project director JICA (Cuttack) to file an affidavit on the detailed status report on the project’s progress by February 3.

The court also reprimanded the JICA project authorities for the tardy progress in spite of the assurance given by them “from time to time to the state administration to complete the project work at the earliest”. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had laid the foundation stone of the JICA project in October 2012 with July 2016 as the deadline for its completion. It was later rescheduled to September 2018.

The HC sought three separate status reports from JICA project authorities — “wards/areas of Cuttack city where the project work has been completed, where it is partly completed and what time will it take to complete the work in those specific areas and in which wards/areas work has not commenced at all”.

“The affidavit has to further indicate what precautionary measures the authorities have taken for smooth passage of pedestrian on roads where the work is in progress as well as for preventing any kind of accident at the construction site,” the division bench of Acting Chief Justice Sanju Panda and Justice S K Sahoo said in its December 20 order, a full text of which was available on Wednesday.

The bench issued the order on “a suo motu writ petition” registered by the high court in the form of a PIL “taking into account newspaper reports relating to a lot of inconvenience faced by the public in general” on account of the JICA drainage and sewerage projects in Cuttack city.

The project envisages a sewage system with an underground sewer line of 385 km long with 36 pumping stations and three sewage treatment plants.

BHUBANESWAR: The state government will start land acquisition for the proposed expansion plan of SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack — at an estimated investment of Rs 1,000 crore — on Thursday after chief minister Naveen Patnaik reviews it, government’s media adviser Manas Mangaraj said here on Wednesday.

After 5T secretary V K Pandian visited the hospital early on Wednesday morning as a precursor to the CM’s visit there a day later, Mangaraj said the government has set a target to complete the acquisition of 25 acre by February 28. “The work will commence on March 1 ,” he said.

The government is planning separate vertical structures dividing the institution into four major zones distinct from each other for patient care, college, doctors’ accommodation and students’ hostels. Naveen is likely to unveil the plan during his visit to SCB on Thursday, sources said.

The government’s media adviser said some patches of land currently under departments of water resources, higher education, technical education will be transferred to the hospital. Similarly, some quarters currently occupied by Class IV employees and government accommodation given to 13 doctors will be removed to create space for the expansion. “While those being removed from government quarters will be given alternate accommodation, the government will announce a suitable compensation package for private individuals affected by the drive,” he said.

To ensure better connectivity to the hospital, the government will widen the road alongside Taladanda canal connecting the hospital to three lanes, he added.

Earlier, Naveen in November last year announced Rs 1,000-crore package for SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack, promising world-class facility at affordable prices. He has announced to increase the bed strength to 3000 from the current 2100 and set a benchmark AIIMS plus (better than AIIMS) for the expanded facility.

Established in 1944 as Orissa Medical College , the SCB (renamed in 1951) with 250 MBBS has daily average footfall of more than 8000 patients. In a parallel move to infra boost, the government is also planning administrative restructuring of the hospital on the lines of AIIMS.

JAIPUR: The state government on Wednesday rolled back the order banning T-shirts and jeans for teachers and employees at government schools in Tonk district.

School education minister Govind Singh Dotasra on Wednesday tweeted, “Orders of banning jeans and t-shirt for teachers in Tonk district have been rejected.

The chief district education officer who has issued such orders without the permission of higher authorities has been issued show-cause notice.”

It may be noted that an order was issued on Tuesday banning T-shirts and jeans for teachers and employees.

Chief district education officer (Tonk) Shivram Singh Yadav on Tuesday said, “These dresses violate the decorum of the school.

They don’t look good in work places. These are indecent and informal dresses. Employees must wear formal wear which will set an example for the students as well,” said Yadav.

Kozhikode: Expressing dissatisfaction over the Supreme Court ’s decision on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ), Muslim organizations have called for the strengthening of the agitations against the law.

IUML state general secretary KPA Majeed said that though it was a positive step that the Supreme Court was ready to hear the case in detail, the party would strengthen the agitations. The party will continue its fight against the law without any compromise, Majeed said in a statement.

Sunni leader Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar said it is known that almost 75% of the people in the country are against CAA. “I wonder why a decision in the case was postponed. All concerned should jointly continue peaceful protests,” he said in a statement.

Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen (KNM) state president T P Abdulla Koya Madani and general secretary Muhammad Madani said that the agitations against CAA should continue. They said the hope of secular democratic forces is the Supreme Court. “The agitations should continue till CAA and NRC are completely withdrawn,” they said.

Jama’at-e-Islami Kerala Amir M I Abdul Azeez called for extending and strengthening of the agitation. Same kind of experience from the apex court in important issues will adversely affect people’s faith in the judiciary, he said, adding that the court could have stayed the implementation of CAA in view of the explosive situation in the country.

Popular Front of India (PFI) leaders told a news conference that the organization would continue the legal fight and protest in the streets in the coming days. Addressing a news conference, PFI national vice-chairman OMA Salam said that it was a fight for the continuance of India as a secular and democratic country.

Students Islamic Organisation (SIO) said that the court did not consider the nationwide agitations while considering the case. The court considered it as an ordinary issue though more than 30 people have lost their lives. The agitation against the CAA should be continued with more coordination, SIO said.

352,['23/01/2020'],Govt can’t invalidate PAN for lack of Aadhaar linkage: Gujarat high court,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court said that a person’s Income Tax (I-T) permanent account number ( PAN ) does not become invalid for filing income tax returns and making transactions just because it is not linked to their Aadhaar card.

The HC said the government cannot make a PAN inoperative or hold the PAN holder to be a defaulter just because their PAN was not linked to their Aadhaar or their Aadhaar number was not quoted till the Supreme Court decides the validity of the Aadhaar Act, which is pending in the form of a reference before a larger bench.

The HC made it clear that until the apex court decides the issue of the Aadhaar Act’s validity as a money bill in Rojer Mathew v/s South Indian Bank Ltd, the government cannot take action against PAN holders for not linking them with their Aadhaar ID, under Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act.

The HC recently passed this order on a petition filed by advocate Bandish Soparkar in 2017, when the central government had issued the diktat mandating linking of PAN with Aadhaar. On March 31, 2019, the central government set a deadline of September 30 for this.

Soparkar submitted before the HC that parting with biometric data by linking his PAN with Aadhaar would cause irreparable damage to him. If his PAN was suspended for not linking it with Aadhaar, he would not be able to operate his account. Since the reference before the SC will have direct impact on the issue, his petition also cannot be decided till the SC decides the reference.

SALIGAO: Power issues in Saligao constituency may be a thing of the past, as the electricity department will float a tender next month to set up a substation in Saligao.

Instead of poles, the substation will have big towers, power minister Nilesh Cabral told a gathering at the Saligao panchayat hall after unveiling a plaque to mark the commencement of work to convert the overhead 11KV feeders to underground system, erection of new DTCs, augmentation of DTCs, erection of additional feeders conversion of single phase to three phase lines, replacement of conductors providing guarding DP and renovation and replacement of FRP box with MS distribution box.

The project cost will be around Rs 13.7 crore and the tender will be floated next month, he said on Wednesday.

“Towers will be placed at every 100m to 800m to get power supply for the substation,” the minister said.

“While erecting the towers, there should be no objections from the villagers and everyone has to stand united in supporting a good cause,” he said.

“The entire power department, including the chief engineer and executive engineer, are working tirelessly to ensure that 24-hour power supply is given to the constituency. But we need people’s cooperation in taking this forward,” Cabral said.

Thanking the minister for the project, Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar said the substation will resolve the major problem of load-shedding that the people of the area had to bear with.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: A farmer in Kuvana village in Banaskantha district found a newly-born girl on January 9. The girl was in pain and was crying profusely - her intestines were out of her body and there was imminent danger of contacting infection. She was first taken to a community health centre (CHC) nearby and then was sent to Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad in hope to save her life.

Hospital authorities said that it’s very likely that the child probably got abandoned by the biological parents due to the congenital condition.

Dr Rakesh Joshi, head of paediatric surgery department at Civil Hospital, said that the girl had a birth defect known as gastroschisis where abdominal wall is not fully developed and thus the intestines get spilled out of the abdominal cavity. “The girl weighed 2.3 kg and her other vitals were normal - prompting us to take her to neonatal intensive care unit and then to operation table. The operation was performed almost immediately at 11 pm on January 9 itself,” he said.

The operation was successful and the girl started feeding. As on January 22, she weighs 2.8 kg and has been handed over to city-based Shishu Gruh, said Civil Hospital officials.

Dr GH Rathod, medical superintendent, Civil Hospital, said that the congenital anomaly has prevalence of about 4 per 1000 live births. “Immediate surgery is required so that the exposed intestines don’t get swollen up and the child doesn’t contact fatal sepsis (infection),” he said.

Dr Joshi said that survival rate of such children is very low. “At Civil Hospital, only three such babies have survived in last 10 years primarily due to infections contacted by the child in open environments. In this case, the child was found soon after abandonment and was relatively free of such conditions. The child care agency has been advised to undergo regular check-ups for next few months,” he said.

355,['23/01/2020'],"Gehlot largesse for Raje, does about turn on perks","This story is from January 23, 2020

Jaipur: The Congress that had strongly opposed a legislation of the then Raje government allowing former chief ministers to have lifetime bungalow seems to have taken a somersault now.

The Rajasthan Ministers’ Salaries Amendment Act 2017 also allowed them to retain staff and allowances equivalent to a cabinet minister.

Sources said after being snubbed by the Supreme Court, the Gehlot government is now planning to make a policy on house allotment to MLAs so that former chief minister Vasundhara Raje, being an MLA, could continue to occupy the same bungalow — 13, Civil Lines. Before the legislation, former chief ministers were allotted just bungalows in the state, but through administrative orders. Raje brought in the legislation after similar orders in Uttar Pradesh were struck down by the Supreme Court.

After the Rajasthan high court struck down the previous Raje-government’s legislation in September last year, the present Ashok Gehlot government went an extra mile and approached the Supreme Court through a special leave petition (SLP) challenging the high court order.

It is well known that both Gehlot and Raje, despite being on opposite sides of the political spectrum, enjoy a mutually ‘beneficial’ rapport.

The argument of the state government in the court in favour of the legislation was that it was essential to protect the dignity of former chief ministers.

The Congress had initially alleged that the legislation was being brought in to specially favour Raje to retain the Civil Lines bungalow for lifetime, which she renovated spending huge sums from the state exchequer though there already existed an official CM residence at 8, Civil Lines. All the CMs before Raje had lived in 8, Civil Lines. After becoming CM for the third time in 2018, Gehlot also moved to 8, Civil Lines.

Under the provisions of the 2017 Act, only former chief ministers who served full terms of five years were eligible for the bonanza. Accordingly, Raje and Gehlot are the only two leaders at present who were eligible for the largesse under this Act.

Ghan Shyam Tiwari, a former BJP leader and a strong critic of Raje now in the Congress said, “the government should comply with the apex court order.” Tiwari had launched a campaign against the legislation.

Raje was allotted 13 Civil lines bungalow after she lost power to Gehot in the 2008 assembly polls. In 2013, Raje returned to the chief minister’s post, but did not shift to the official CM residence at 8, Civil Lines. After she lost power in 2018, days before the new government took over the same bungalow was allotted to her.

A PIL was filed in the high court challenging the Rajasthan Ministers’ Salaries Amendment Act 2017 in the light of the Supreme Court ruling and the high court declared the legislation illegal.

JAIPUR: With Republic Day approaching, anti-CAA protests in the state have gained momentum.

The Bhim Kranti Sena is holding a protest march from Gandhi Circle to Raj Bhawan on January 24. Muslim women in Tonk have started another Shaheen Bagh with 24x7 protests. Along with civil society groups in Jaipur, Ajmer, Kota and Sikar will hoist the national flag on the intervening night of January 25-26.

Political activist Mohsin Rasheed plans to write the Preamble with blood of people of all faiths to mark Republic Day.

“Our Republic Day has never so meaningful as it is going to be this year. People from all faiths and communities will donate blood and will use it to write the Preamble to represent the ethos of the country,” said Rasheed. Tonk has started holding protests daily from 10am to 6pm to express their solidarity with like-minded people.

Barely 150 km from Tonk is Kota, which is also witnessing a round-the-clock sit-in near the house of Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. “We have plan to hoist the flag on January 26 midnight at the protest site followed by patriotic songs. The message is clear. We want to reclaim the Constitution from the hands of the fascists who are unfortunately at the helms of affairs,” said Shifa Khalid, a mother of three children. Khalid has been holding 24/7 sit-in at Kota since January 14.

Samvidhan Bachao Andolon, a non-registered group started by Mohammad Alimuddin in Ajmerm, will hold a rally with madarsa children in Dargah Bazaar holding the Tricolour. “It is no longer a protest for us. It is become a movement for us to know our rights and duties. We have invited Constitution experts who will address the people on universal human rights and our Constitution,” said Alimuddin.

358,['23/01/2020'],"Overbridge, underpass at Guirim opens for traffic","This story is from January 23, 2020

5 coconut saplings have been planted along this route

PANAJI: Both lanes of the approximately 250-metre-long overbridge-cum-underpass at Guirim were thrown open for use recently. Thirty-five coconut saplings have also been planted in the structure’s median by the road works contractor to replace the trees that perished while construction was on.

In the last week of December 2019, only one two-lane section of the overbridge proceeding towards Panaji had been opened, while the lane leading towards Mapusa was opened just two weeks ago. However, although both lanes are operational, there has neither been an official inauguration nor has any signage been erected to indicate that the road can now be used. This has left motorists confused and the frequency of vehicles on the lane leading towards Mapusa remains low. Most vehicles travelling towards Mapusa continue to crowd the narrow service road below the overbridge.

PWD principal chief engineer Uttam Parsekar confirmed that both two-lane sections of the overbridge could now be used. While the overbridge is 27m wide, the underbridge has a width of 12m. It is not yet known when the requisite signage is expected to be erected near the new structure.

Environmentalists had raised objections during construction of the project and had asked PWD officials to rework the alignment to retain the existing coconut trees on the stretch. The structure was designed accordingly to keep the coconut trees in the median of the overbridge. Parsekar told TOI that as promised, the road works contractor has planted 35 coconut saplings in the median of the Guirim overbridge-cum-underpass to replace those that perished during construction.

He also said that construction of the other overbridge-cum-underpass at the Green Park road intersection is expected to be ready for use by December. This is expected to further ease congestion on this route.

Both, the Guirim and the Green Park structures, are part of the ongoing highway four-/six-laning work in Goa. The work has been taken up as per estimated vehicle density in Goa up to the year 2030.

The overbridges-cum-underpasses are meant to avoid slowing down of traffic at road intersections and also to reduce accidents.

While the Karaswada-Bambolim highway expansion contract is worth Rs 850 crore, the Patradevi to Karaswada project has been awarded for Rs 630 crore.

359,['23/01/2020'],Centre has become an agent of Vedanta: Narayanasamy,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Puducherry: Chief minister V Narayanasamy expressed deep concern over the proposed hydrocarbon project by the Union government arguing that the project will spell doom for agriculture besides depleting groundwater resources leading to intrusion of seawater into the groundwater table and turning potable water saline and urged the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan to scrap the project in the Union territory of Puducherry.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Narayanasamy said he has written letters to Modi and Pradhan on shelving the project after the Centre amended the environment impact assessment notification 2006 exempting prior environmental clearance and public hearing for hydrocarbon project.

Narayanasamy said the Centre roped in a private firm Vedanta Limited to explore hydrocarbon at 339sqkm onshore site spread in the districts of Karaikal and Puducherry in the Union territory and Nagapattinam and Villupuram in Tamil Nadu and at 4,047sqkm offshore site along the coast of these districts. The Centre has identified 2sqkm site at Bahour in Puducherry and 39.8sqkm site at Karaikal to explore hydrocarbon.

He said the firm will dig wells that run 3,500m to 4,500m deep leading to the depletion of groundwater. Moreover, the firm will use toxic chemicals in the drilling operations to explore hydrocarbon that will lead to severe air, land and water pollution.

“The project sites are fertile agricultural lands in the fag-end of the Cauvery delta in Karaikal and pockets with high population density in both regions. The project will wipe out agricultural activities, lead to severe environmental pollution, deplete groundwater resources, lead to intrusion of seawater into the groundwater table and turn potable water saline,” he said.

He said he wrote to Pradhan on May 20 last year and to the Union home ministry on June 10 last year registering Puducherry's stiff opposition for the project. “The legislative assembly also passed a unanimous resolution on July 27 last year against the project outlying its ill-effects,” he said.

He pointed out that Pradhan made an assurance in the Parliament that the Centre will scrap the project if people were against it.

“The Centre’s amendment exempting prior environmental clearance and public hearing for hydrocarbon project is nothing but curbing the rights of the states and Union territories. The amendment exposed the autocratic attitude of the Centre, which has become an agent of private firm Vedanta,” Narayanasamy charged.

He reiterated Puducherry government’s decision of not permitting hydrocarbon project in the Union territory.

PANAJI: Since deciding to accept the research findings of the Indian Road Congress and opting to use aggregate from construction debris as a base layer in roads in the highway expansion work, such material has been used in four major road stretches, PWD chief engineer Uttam Parsekar told TOI.The segregated material from construction debris has been used as base in the road from Green Park to Karaswada and Bambolim to Panaji, in the Canacona bypass road and also in parts of the western bypass road in South Goa .Parsekar said that the use of construction debris will continue wherever required.“As of now, we have been able to clear a considerable part of the construction debris lying across the state. The problem was most pronounced near Karaswada road stretch where a major part of the debris was lying and it has now been cleared with use of its aggregates in the road works,” he said.The PWD decided to accept the research findings of the Indian Road Congress last year as a solution to the growing problem of construction debris in Goa .In 2018, the high court of Bombay at Goa took note of this problem where construction debris was being clandestinely and illegally dumped by miscreants in any open space available across the state. To address this desecration of public and private spaces, the high court issued directives to the state government to identify sites where the construction debris can be offloaded after informing the authorities.Accordingly, the state government identified 13 sites by the sides of the national highways where the construction debris could be dumped. As land in these 13 sites was already acquired for the ongoing highway expansion work, dumping debris there was seen as a good temporary solution.But the issue resurfaced with the 13 sites getting filled sooner than the state had anticipated. Work of the highway expansion also progressed during 2019, which meant that the land acquired for the road widening needed to be cleared of the debris.As a result, both the district collectors, along with the director of mines and geology and PWD officials began working on identifying sites like abandoned mining pits and laterite quarries where such waste could be dumped.The mounds of construction debris piled up along the highway also made for an ugly sight.All this forced the PWD to look for other solutions and finally officials decided to adopt findings of the Indian Road Congress.Now, debris such as broken tiles, concrete and plaster of Paris are broken down and laid as base for the road.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73538858,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-460380,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/use-of-construction-debris-in-road-works-to-continue-pwd/articleshow/73531928.cms

CHENNAI: The number of students applying for Neet-2020 from Tamil Nadu has dropped by nearly 17% over 2018-19, against an increase of 74,000 nationwide, as per National Testing Agency data.There are 1.17 lakh applications this year against 1.4o lakh in 2019, the first time a dip has been registered since 2016. This, say teachers and counsellors, is due to many reasons including increasing cut-off, which proved tough for state board students, and more repeaters getting seats. The huge demand-supply gap in the number of seats has also discouraged aspirants from writing Neet without preparation.In 2019, of the 4,202 students who joined MBBS after writing Neet, 2,916 (70%) were old students. This year, many said they would take a break and apply in 2021. R Vivek Kumar of Chennai said, “I have been attending coaching class and preparing for the exam. But I am not confident of getting into a medical school this year. I want to perfect my scores in mock test before I write my entrance.”N Vijayan, principal of Zion Matric Higher Secondary School in Tambaram, said many students were disheartened last year after cut-offs increased, by 80 to 100 marks, across categories. “Since a majority of repeaters got seats, many students wanted to take a break to prepare for medical entrance. We counselled them to apply for Neet this year.”P Swaminathan, secretary of SRV Schools in Namakkal and Trichy, said more than 50% of their students appearing for Neet 2020 were repeaters. “The attitude towards MBBS is changing . Current batch students are looking for options other than medicine.” The cut-off for BC students, which was 475 marks in 2019, could cross 500 this year.While the number of students joining biology stream or science stream in Class XI is declining every year, the number of Neet aspirants from government and government-aided schools has dropped drastically this year. “Even our teachers are not very enthusiastic due to the results.

The permits for building the demolished buildings were issued during his tenure.

Sources said the agency sought permission in the first week of December to prosecute Devassy , who is now a serving councillor of the Maradu municipality. “The government has sought a legal opinion from the director general of prosecution,” said a senior official.

Crime branch claims it has enough evidence to prosecute him in all three cases registered in connection with the construction of the apartment complexes. Devassy has claimed that he had no role in the unauthorized construction and the responsibility rested on those who approved the plan.

Though those who had worked with him has given statements against him, the agency is unsure whether the prosecution can guarantee his conviction.

The agency has so far collected the statements of about half of the 250-odd owners of the demolished apartments.

Rs 42 lakh has been okayed for project

JAIPUR: Golden Hour app will be launched by the city traffic police which will help ambulances get clear passages even in heavy traffic hours. The traffic police will connect private hospitals and ambulances with the app. Also, the app will help in creating green corridors depending on the need of the patients. The traffic police on Tuesday issued the proposal inviting private players.

The police have invited request for proposal from private players to provide them design, development and commissioning of Golden Hour app with monitoring system with an estimated cost of Rs 42 lakh. With the app, the traffic police are aiming to save life of the patients while they are being transported from the point of accident or any other pick up point to the hospital within one hour, which is known as ‘Golden Hour’. “We have received approval of Rs 42 lakh for the project from Road Safety fund,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Prakash said.

According to proposal, the traffic police will conduct vehicle profiling of ambulances, fire brigade and other emergency vehicles using the application, which will be designed for the purpose. Once the information is uploaded and submitted to the server, the vehicle will be registered for availing the service of the app. Each vehicle record will be assigned with a unique QR code that will be pasted on each vehicle. At a time, when every second is important, the app will help ambulances search for a hospital directly or add a stop to pick up a patient for pick up from either their residence or accident spot. The application will automatically detect the user’s live location. The user has to input the destination in the search field.

The admin of the app will provide a safer route for any active requests thus making the user take a route that can save time in case of emergencies. The live movement module of emergency vehicle will be based on Google map along with live traffic status, which will be capable of showing movement of multiple emergency vehicles. The module will contain user friendly option of changing the heavy traffic route by the traffic control room based on traffic movement.

Panaji: Stating that the order by the Lokayukta to file an FIR against former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar and others was no surprise, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said it reconfirms the extent to which the elected government of Goa is controlled by the mining lobby.

Party general secretary Pradeep Padgaonkar said despite umpteen opportunities to reform the mining industry under the guidance of the Supreme Court judgements, the BJP government (and Congress government in the past) continued to make decisions in favour of its mining lobby friends.

“Because of this complete capitulation by elected leaders, today not only are the mining dependents in the state suffering, but also the state is in serious financial crunch,” Padgaonkar said.

Nithyananda

AHMEDABAD: The Interpol has issued a blue corner notice for Nithyananda on a request from Gujarat police to locate him, because he is considered the prime accused in the criminal case of illegal confinement of children and putting them to forced labour at his ashram in Ahmedabad.

The police informed a local court about the blue corner notice being issued because it has mentioned Nithyananda as an absconder in the chargesheet, which was filed last week. The chargesheet mentions that since Nithyanada’s location could not be found, the investigation officer obtained an arrest warrant against him from the court under provisions of Section 70 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Besides Nithyananda, charges have been filed in a local court by Vivekanandnagar police against two of his ashram administrators, his sadhvis Harini Chelappan alias Pranpriya and Riddhi Ravikiran alias Priatatva. They have been in judicial custody ever since their arrest upon an FIR lodged by a parent, whose four children were at the Nithyananda ashram in Ahmedabad, which is named ‘Sarvagnapeetham’. The complainant’s two adult daughters are missing and he has filed a habeas corpus petition in the Gujarat high court.

The man lodged an FIR in November after the ashram management refused to give custody of his two minor children to him. He accused the ashram authorities and Nithyananda of illegally confining, beating and abusing the children as well as of forcing them to do labour.

High Court metro station

CHENNAI: It is either a long walk or wait for multiple modes of transport for visitors and staff to reach Fort St George from the nearest metro station everyday. They are not likely to get any relief soon as Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has dropped the plan to build a foot overbridge (FoB) or a skywalk to link High Court metro station with Fort suburban station or the secretariat. Instead, CMRL is operating feeder services to the state administrative headquarters from Government Estate metro station, which commuters call an ‘erratic’ service.

A year ago, CMRL officials were mulling over the idea of constructing an FoB or a pedestrian subway, whichever is feasible, to encourage government staff to use the facility. High Court metro station, which is about less than 2km from Secretariat, is linked to Broadway bus terminus, NSC Bose Road and Esplanade Road through access points.

Metro rail officials said they dropped the plan as an FoB or skywalk to link High Court metro with Fort suburban station across North Fort Road was not feasible. “We thought about building an FoB initially but we found it is structurally not feasible. We have built footpath and started feeder services exclusively to Fort St George from Government Estate metro station since August 2019,” the officials said.

CMRL also operates feeder cabs from Government Estate metro station to the Secretariat. But Secretariat staff said the service was irregular. “The CMRL mobile app shows there is feeder service from Central metro to Secretariat, but we have not seen it,” said G Venkatesan, a former secretary, Tamil Nadu Secretariat Association. “CMRL could provide us a link to access High Court metro station which is closer than Government Estate. A regular feeder to Central metro will also help as our staff who come from Anna Nagar and those from suburban areas could travel faster to work because there is barely any MTC service from Central to Fort St George,” he added.

Sources said the idea to link the secretariat with a metro line was dropped after the new legislative assembly complex was inaugurated at Government Omandurar Estate in 2010.

On Tuesday, the court had granted bail to four protesters.

Speaking to TOI, defence counsel Zaki Anwar said, ""The court has granted bail to Aamir, a resident of Hillal Sarai; Waseem and Furqan, both residents of Mian Sarai; and Mohsin, a resident of Hindukhera in Deepa Sarai locality, after hearing the arguments on their bail applications.""

Anwar said, ""The court granted bail to all the four accused, against two sureties of Rs 60,000 each. As per the bail conditions, the accused will have to cooperate with the investigation, cannot tamper with evidence and cannot make any threats against the witnesses.”

""Aamir was also tortured in police custody, and his money and mobile phone were snatched by police personnel,"" Anwar added.

Another defense counsel, Tausef Hassan Khan, said, ""Another bail application is pending before the court of Additional District and Sessions Judge that had asked police to produce video footage of the violence that took place during anti-CAA protests.""

Those who were granted bail were among the 27 people arrested for violence during the anti-CAA protest at Chandusi Chauraha on December 20. SHO of Sambhal Kotwali police station, Ravindra Pratap Singh, had lodged the FIR against the protesters under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapons), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly), 307 (attempt to murder), 332 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant), 336 (endangering life or personal safety of others) and sections 3 and 4 of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984.

Bareilly: Under the wraps for the last 43 years, a shocking glitch in the service record of a lekhpal-- revenue official-- came out in open with his retirement, leaving the local administration and the revenue department UP’s Bareilly district perplexed. While disbursing the post-retirement remunerations to Shivkumar, the local treasury carefully examined his records and found, to their shock, that he had joined the service at an age of 16 years in 1976. But, according to the government norms, no revenue official can be hired before hitting the age of 21 years.

After serving for 43 years and a few months, Shivkumar retired on March 31, 2019.

Now, the Bareilly’s treasury department has forwarded the Shivkumar’s file to additional district magistrate’s (ADM) VK Singh. The ADM, on his part, has written to state revenue board seeking directions in this matter.

When contacted, ADM Singh on Wednesday said, “We have written to additional commissioner (finance) of UP revenue board seeking guidance in this matter. We want to know what amount of money could be recovered and on which grounds.”

“For fresh recruitment for the post of lekhpal, the minimum age required is 21. While in case of giving job on the humanitarian ground to kin of a deceased government official, some relaxation in age limits may be given. But, even in case of appointing kin of a deceased government official, the minimum age cannot be less than 18. We are examining if it was a matter related to fresh appointment or he was given job in place of his father after latter’s demise,” SDM Singh said.

According to the service book of Shivkumar, his date of birth is April 1, 1959. And he was appointed lekhpal on March 15, 1976. After completing probation period of nine years, he got permanent status on July 1, 1987.

Puducherry: A Puducherry court on Monday granted bail to eight people including Puducherry women's commission chairperson Rani Rajan Babu, her sons – Ashok Thuyavan and Balaji Raja and a tahsildar from Tamil Nadu R Banumathy in a Rs 2.73 crore forgery case in the Union territory.

The CBCID had booked 11 people including the eight people on charges of forging the document of a grove in Puducherry and receiving compensation of Rs 2.73 crore from the government. The erstwhile grove is popularly referred to as 'Kuyil Thoppu' where the nationalist Tamil poet Bharathiyar penned most of his poems during his 10-year stay in Puducherry.

The CBCID booked them under sections 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy), 193 (punishment for giving false evidence in a judicial proceeding), 209 (dishonestly making false claim in court), 210 (fraudulently obtaining decree for sum not due) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian penal code.

The agency’s action came after a direction from Puducherry chief judicial magistrate. As per the complaint, the 11 people forged the document of a 4.34-hectare of land belonging to P Aravamudhu and two others represented by their power agent V Seenuvasamoorthy Reddiar and received a compensation of Rs 2.73 crore from the government after the government acquired 2.5 hectares of land.

The government acquired 1.46 hectare for constructing a memorial for late Congress stalwart Kamaraj, 0.61-hectare for the East Coast Road project and 0.43-hectare for the construction of the interstate police wireless quarters. The accused people made a fake certificate dated January 30, 1935, claiming that the land was sold to them. They made a false claim for compensation based on the forged sale certificate before the court and received the compensation without the knowledge of the complainants.

Ahmedabad: The state government plans to relocate the city’s oldest ayurved college, which lies in ruins, from the Walled City area to a new campus on SG Highway. The college, Akhandanand Ayurved Mahavidyala, established more than half a century ago, is located near Bhadra fort. The five-storey building is in a dilapidated state and needs urgent repairs. The renovation of the college has been a challenge as it lies in the vicinity of a heritage property and any new construction or makeover is not permitted, said government sources.

“The college building was severely affected during the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat,” said a government official. “Numerous attempts to repair it since then have failed. The government has recently decided to relocate the college operations by building a new campus close to Sola Civil Hospital on SG Highway.” A team of officials from the state government’s health department had visited the college to inspect the building, the official said.

The college, affiliated to Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar, has 500 students pursuing various undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The college is associated with an ayurved hospital which lies in the vicinity. “The current plan is only for the relocation of the college. It does not include the hospital,” a source said.

375,['23/01/2020'],Maoist’s AK-47 looted from CRPF after ’14 Sukma ambush,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The crime branch confirmed that the AK-47 rifle recovered from slain Maoist leader Manivasagam in Manjikkandy , Palakkad in October last year were among those that were seized by Maoists from CRPF personnel who were ambushed and killed within Tongpal police station limits in Sukma, Chhattisgarh, on March 11, 2014.

In the report prepared by crime branch chief and ADGP Tomin J Thachankary after verification by a crime branch team, it has been said that the serial number of the AK-47 rifle (BE 385377) which was recovered from Manivasagam, who was killed in a police encounter, matched with one of the six AK-47 rifles seized by Maoists after the Sukma attack in which 11 CRPF personnel, four policemen and one civilian were killed. There are cases charged under IPC and Arms Act, in this regard, at Tongpal police station, the report said.

A team of 40 men from 80th Battalion of CRPF and police were on a search operation when they were trapped and ambushed by Maoists. After inflicting heavy casualties, the Maoists had taken away weapons and wireless sets from the troopers, and later distributed among the Maoist cadres.

The crime branch report also confirmed that the two .303 rifles recovered from Maoists in Manjikkandy were among those looted from Koraput town police station, Sadar police station, Lakshmipur police station, Kakiriguma police station and Narayanpatna police station by armed Maoists. The Maoists had then attacked district treasury and district armoury and had seized 500 guns and more than 25,000 ammunitions.

The police had seized as many as seven guns, including the AK-47 rife, two shotguns, two .303 rifles and two country-made guns, from the LWE cadres after the Manjikkandy encounter. Sources in the police department said that the remaining arms and ammunitions also were either stolen or smuggled from Nepal.

Four Maoists were killed in the encounter with the police at Manjikkandy in Palakkad, and the police had subjected the arms that were seized from them to ballistic examination. The police had then contacted police forces of all the other states to check the origin of the seized weapons.

Margao: Welcoming the Lokayukta's recommendation to the government to entrust the probe into the renewal of 88 mining leases to the CBI and for filing an FIR, state Congress president Girish Chodankar said that the party would soon lodge a complaint with CBI seeking a probe.

Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Chodankar pointed out that Congress had in 2018 filed a complaint in the matter with the governor as well as the DGP, but none of the authorities initiated any action.

Chodankar said that while they had specifically named former chief minister Manohar Parrikar in their complaint, the probe will also lead to links of the incumbent chief minister Pramod Sawant in the case.

“I am sure Parrikar will be indicted in the case if an inquiry is initiated,” Chodankar said.

He also condemned Sawant’s statement to the effect that the Lokayukta’s order was recommendatory in nature and not mandatory on the government.

Pointing out that the then SP (crime) Karthik Kashyap had replied saying that there was no prima facie case made out in the Congress’ complaint, Chodankar said that Lokayukta’s order indicated that the police were acting under pressure not to act on their complaint.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday condemned state GST officials for camping at a trader’s house for eight days and said that the officers were liable to be punished under the Indian Penal Code.A bench of Justice Harsha Devani and Justice Sangeeta Vishen held that intimidating the trader’s family to extort confessions was tantamount to an offence under section 348 of IPC — wrongful confinement to extort confession or compel restoration of property. This is punishable with a jail term of up to three years.The matter involved Paresh Chauhan, who is behind bars at present. The goods & services tax officers conducted a search on his premises and stayed at his house from October 10 to October 18, 2019. The stay came to an end only after the HC issued a notice deeming their stay at Chauhan’s house illegal. His relatives were kept under house arrest with SRP guards outside 24X7. His relatives were not permitted to leave home without permission.This incident shocked the HC and it said, “It would be failing in its duty as a sentinel on the qui vive [meaning ‘on the alert or lookout’] if it were to turn a blind eye to the violation of the legal and fundamental rights of citizens by authoritarianism and remain a mute spectator.” The court said that it passed the order “to curb any further abuse of powers in this manner by the authorities under the GST Acts”.The court opined that the GST officials’ work could have been concluded on Day 1, but they chose to stay for eight days with the SRP outside the house to scare the family. This is abhorrent and cannot be countenanced, the court said. It further said, “No provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for investigation, search or seizure, empowers a police officer to remain a moment longer at any premises once the search is over.”The HC said that the officials were trying to extract information from the family members, and not to trace hidden documents. The officials already had information about documents secreted by Chauhan when they talked to his mother and took away her phone, but they did not bother to use the details.The HC observed, “In this case, all statutory requirements are thrown to the winds and in flagrant violation of the powers vested in them, the concerned officers have resided in the residential premises of the petitioner for eight days and confined and intimidated his family members...This is nothing but a blatant abuse of powers.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73537379,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-142987,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gst-officers-camp-at-traders-home-criminal-offence-says-hc/articleshow/73530566.cms

V Saroja

CHENNAI: Trashing poll-time malpractice complaints against Tamil Nadu social welfare minister V Saroja , who was elected MLA from Rasipuram constituency in 2016, the Madras high court on Wednesday upheld her .

The election petition was filed by DMK candidate VP Duraiswamy, who lost the election by a margin of 9,631 votes. His primary contention was that Saroja bribed voters and was involved in various other election malpractices to ensure her victory.

Rejecting the plea, Justice V Bharathidasan said, “To prove the charges of corrupt practice in an election petition, the proof of commission of corrupt practices must be clear, cogent, specific and reliable as the charge of corrupt practice is almost like a criminal charge and the onus is on the person who brings forth that charge to prove it by leading reliable, trustworthy and satisfactory evidence.”

Noting that the election cannot be set aside on mere possibilities, unless the allegation of corrupt practices is satisfactorily proved, the court held that the election of the returned candidate cannot be set aside.

Relying on media reports, the petitioner claimed that when former chief minister J Jayalalithaa visited Salem for election campaign Saroja ferried 5,000 voters from Rasipuram to Salem through vehicles arranged by her. Refusing to accept such allegations, the court made it clear that the petitioner cannot merely rely on newspaper reports without evidence to substantiate the same.

“In the instant case the evidence is hopelessly wanting. The petitioner has come out with vague pleadings in his election petition and absolutely there is no substantial evidence to substantiate the allegations of corrupt practice,” the judge said. With the available evidence on record, it is not possible to connect the returned candidate with any of the corrupt practices alleged in the election petition. The petitioner has miserably failed to prove the allegations made in the petition with clear and cogent evidence, Justice Bharathidasan said.

After taking over the reins of the state unit, Bansidhar Bhagat , newly-elected president of Uttarakhand BJP , spoke to TOI’s Yogesh Kumar about the challenges being faced by the saffron party in the Himalayan state and how he plans to steer the party ahead of the 2022 assembly polls. Excerpts:

What will be your priorities for the party?

I have asked all district-level office-bearers to identity 25 workers in each booth in their area to have ‘chai pe charcha’ with them to know what are their expectations from the party in their region. This would help us in fixing goals at the booth level.

Any specific strategy that you have in mind for the 2022 assembly polls?

To reach any goal, one needs both josh and hosh (passion and wisdom). This synergy is necessary to win any political battle and I think that along with the support of my party workers, we will register a landslide victory in the 2022 elections.

How do you rate your main opposition — the Congress party — in Uttarakhand?

Congress has become politically irrelevant both ideologically and organisationally. In Uttarakhand, it is rudderless and has no vision for the state’s development. On the other hand, the BJP government under CM Trivendra Singh Rawat has delivered what it promised to the people.

KOCHI: Works related to ‘Operation Breakthrough’, the project planned to resolve waterlogging in the city, kicked off on Wednesday. All the 36 works under the first phase of the project will be completed by March 31.

Though most of the works pertain to cleaning of drains and canals, the district administration is learnt to have decided to invoke provisions of the Disaster Management Act for evicting encroachments in certain areas, including those along Vivekananda Thodu near the KSRTC bus station and Karanakkodam Thodu near Kaloor.

“In certain areas in Kaloor, owners of some of the apartment complexes have covered Karanakkodam Thodu in front of their residences using concrete slabs. The slabs have reduced the canal’s depth. We will send notices to the owners,” an official associated with the clean-up project said.

“Similarly, some small shops have been set up after encroaching upon the Vivekananda Thodu. We will be sending notices to them as well. If they don’t abide by our instructions, the district administration may invoke the provisions of Disaster Management Act,” the official said.

District collector Suhas S visited some of the areas where works were being carried out on Wednesday. He personally monitored the works at HIG in Panampilly Nagar, Paradise Road in Ponnurunni, Karanakkodam Thodu and Vivekananda Thodu.

The district administration has given instruction to the corporation for carrying out works suggested by the people’s representatives and the public on a priorit basis.

Bareilly: After a delegation of Jamat Raza-e-Mustafa, a prominent group of Sunni Barelvi Muslims, recently met clerics and people protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Delhi, shahar qazis who also met the group’s members have now decided to spread awareness among people in their area on the drawbacks of CAA and NRC .

The shahar qazis stressed on “holding peaceful protests till the government gives in and announces a rollback”.

On Wednesday, national vice-president, Jamat Raza-e-Mustafa, Salman Hasan Khan, said, “Our delegation met protesters at Shaheen Bagh, Jamia Millia University and Jawaharlal Nehru University and also conducted a meeting with shahar qazis. As shahar qazis hold sway in their respective areas, it has been decided that they will brief the people about drawbacks of CAA and NRC. We want people to carry on with silent protests against CAA and NRC across the country.”

Khan added, “We fear that ‘doubtful’ citizens would be identified during National Population Register (NPR) exercise by local officials who may put a large number of people in this category.”

Maulana Ikram Raza Khan, who was also part of the Jamat Raza-e-Mustafa delegation, said, “We will intensify our peaceful protests across the country to put pressure on the government to rollback CAA and NRC.”

Meanwhile, a delegation of Jamat Raza-e-Mustafa met Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai on Wednesday and requested him to reject CAA, NRC and NPR. Khan said, “If Maharashtra government refuses to pass CAA and NRC, it will create an environment of trust and peace among the people of state and country.”

Notably, criticising the CAA, Sunni Barelvi cleric Mufti Asjad Raza Khan in his statement issued last month had said, “This is not a Hindu-Muslim matter, but is about the country’s Constitution. The country can only be run by the Constitution, not by dictatorship. People who are protesting against NRC and CAA are praiseworthy. Silent protest is our right.”

Bareilly: The district administration has assured an inquiry and relevant action in the case of encroachment upon Delapir pond in the city, after a local NGO lodged a complaint against the illegal occupation of the pond by colonisers, land mafias and shopkeepers.

Pradeep Kumar, secretary of NGO Jaagar Jan Kalyaan, told TOI, “We have submitted a memorandum to Bareilly district magistrate Nitin Kumar, seeking action against the encroachment on Delapir pond. In a similar case of encroachment on a pond in Agra, the high court in September 2019 had ordered that if a place is recorded as a ‘pond’ in revenue records from before 1951, it should be restored to its original shape by removing all encroachment. The order was further extended by the HC across the state. We have requested the administration to take cognizance and relevant action in the case.”

Kumar added, “We have affixed copies of a demolition order passed by BDA for the Delapir pond site in 2017, as well as the copy of revenue records, stating that the place, spread over 1.965 hectare in plot number 133 of Delapir, has existed as a ‘pond’ since before 1951.”

As per the HC order of 2019, “All collectors of each district in the state shall entrust the additional district magistrate (finance and revenue) to make a list of ponds in existing revenue records in the year 1951-52. He shall also prepare a list of ponds which are under encroachment, or in respect of which, lease has been granted. The collectors shall proceed to cancel the lease of these ponds and restore them in accordance with law and directions issued.”

Bareilly SDM Ishan Pratap Singh told TOI, “A survey will be conducted to ascertain the encroachment status of the pond, following which relevant legal action will be initiated.”

For quite some time, builders, shopkeepers, land mafias and colonizers have encroached upon Delapir pond, in Biharman Nagla area of Bareilly. BMC environment engineer Sanjeev Pradhan said, “Plans are afoot to renovate Delapir pond and convert it into a tourist spot, with a shopping complex, food court, parking facility and space for boating likely to come up. The pond area will be restored and brought into its original shape. The plan is under consideration and once finalised, work will be taken up.”

Kolhapur: Officials from the district health department of the Kolhapur zilla parishad (ZP) have advised extreme precaution to the residents of Shirol after reports of two deaths due to dengue-like symptoms in the past week.

Even though the officials are denying that the deaths were caused due to dengue , claiming that the diagnosis of the said deceased patients was not done, they admit that the situation needs urgent attention.

Vinod More, the district malaria officer, Kolhapur ZP, told TOI, “Considering the current situation, we have started door-to-door survey across Shirol, which has a population of around 30,000 residents. We have also collected blood samples of four patients who were showing symptoms matching dengue-like infection. The reports are likely to be confirmed by Thursday morning.”

More further said that the inadequate efforts from the Shirol nagar parishad staff members have also contributed to the deteriorating situation.

“We have formed 15 different teams. They are surveying the area. They have already found around six spots that are mosquito breeding sites with live larvae. These sites are being destroyed,” he said.

According to the health department officials, citizens have a lot of complaints with respect to the town’s hygiene, which seems to be an increasing concern for the administration officials too. He added that they are closely monitoring the houses which have reported breeding sites.

He said the incubation period of dengue, after the bite of a virus-carrying mosquito, can be anywhere between three and 15 days. The symptoms may show in parts. They usually beging with more begin symptoms such as headache, chills, fever, pain in eyes, loss of appetite and backache. Patients can also be affected by joint pain in the first hours of dengue.

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: Pandharpur rural police have arrested two people, who were found using two banned chemicals for production of artificial milk. One of the suspects has two previous milk adulteration cases against him.

Acting on a tip-off, the food and drugs administration (FDA) officials conducted a raid at a private dairy at Sugaon Bhose village last week. The FDA team found more than 2,719 kg of chemicals at the dairy, including melamine, which has been banned in the country. They found three bags of melamine, each containing 25 kg of the banned substance.

Food Safety Officer Prashant Kuchekar told TOI that melamine is banned India since 2008 and its use to manufacture artificial milk was a serious offence. Melamine can be used only for industrial purpose in India.

FDA officials then lodged a complaint with the police and a case under sections 188 (disobedience of order), 272 (adulteration of food or drink with intent to sale), 273 (sale of noxious food or drink and 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc with intent to commit crime ) of the IPC, along with section 59 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, was registered against ten suspects.

The police have arrested two of them — identified as Dattatraya Mahadeo Jadhav and his driver Ganesh Gawli. Both are currently in the judicial custody.

Pandharpur rural police have registered various offences against ten persons, two of them arrested under various sections of Indian Penal Code and Food Safety and Standards Act 2006.

Prashant Patil, assistant police inspector of Karkamb police station, told TOI that they had identified a person from Mumbai, who had supplied melamine to the suspects. “We visited his Mumbai house thrice, but he is not traceable,” he said and did not rule out possibility of large racket of use of banned chemical in the country.

Patil said that preliminary investigation has revealed that Jadhav had studied up to class X and had completed some diploma in veterinary. Investigation has also found that Jadhav was involved in two milk adulteration cases – one in Pandharpur in 2009 and another in Phaltan in 2016. Both the cases are currently pending before the court.

Officials of FDA, who conducted the raid, said that the suspects had already used 23 kg of melamine to manufacture artificial milk. Considering that 20 mg of melamine is used to manufacture one litre of milk, police officials apprehend that the suspects could have manufactured more than 50,000 litres of milk by using the banned chemical. Apart from melamine, paraffin and non-edible oil was also found.

FDA officials said that three bags of melamine, which were found during the action, were imported from Iran. Police investigation has revealed that Jadhav used to send money to a supplier in Mumbai through hawala racket. Police have zeroed down a transport company, which used to supply melamine to the suspect.

NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s remark that he stood with Shaheen Bagh protesters triggered a controversy on Thursday with BJP leaders unleashing an attack on him and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra called Aam Aadmi Party an anti-Hindu party, while Hari Nagar candidate Tajinder Singh Bagga said that BJP stood with India and AAP with Shaheen Bagh protesters.

Asked during a talk on a television channel about the absence of AAP functionaries at Shaheen Bagh, the deputy CM said he stood with the protesters. He added that it was beyond him to open the road closed due to the protests.

While Sisodia came out in support of the protesters in the morning, Kejriwal, at a town hall with Times Now, said that protesting was everyone’s right, but people should not be inconvenienced. Asked why the blockade of the arterial road had not been lifted, the chief minister said it was beyond his jurisdiction to remove the barricades on the Kalindi Kunj road.

In the ensuing showdown, Patra asked Kejriwal to clarify on Sisodia’s statement. “AAP was behind provoking and instigating people. The reality has come out of Manish Sisodia’s mouth. These are the people who feel proud in claiming to be anarchist. We are watching the height of anarchy in Shaheen Bagh and Sisodia’s statement has proved that one anarchist is in support of another,” Patra told media persons.

The BJP spokesperson also accused Congress and AAP of creating confusion on CAA. “All these things are being done for vote-bank politics. I want to ask Kejriwal that if you stand with the Shaheen Bagh protesters, why are you not with the people of Sarita Vihar, Jasola and Madanpur Khadar who are suffering because the roads have been blocked,” Patra said, adding that Delhiites were ready to give a befitting reply to those misleading people with the politics of appeasement.

Bareilly: Moradabad Municipal Corporation has roped in retired military personnel to assist them in the enforcement activities in the district, starting with maintenance of law and order during an anti-encroachment drive on city rods.

According to information from the municipality, they earlier had to rely on the overburdened city police during such drives, which meant work was shoddy. They also said this move will help curb disputes with encroachers and other problems that MMC faced during earlier evictions.

Gambhir Singh, additional municipal commissioner, Moradabad, said, “The MMC anti-encroachment team is too understaffed to take up enforcement tasks in the city. Therefore, retired military personnel have been recruited to assist us in eviction activities. This should also help make the enforcement process smoother, as we’ll no longer have to rely on cops. It should also make launching crackdowns on encroachers, who often get into brawls with our staff during anti-encroachment drives, easier.”

Singh added, “Retired colonel Shivendra Shahi has been appointed as chief of the enforcement wing. A team of 12 retired military personnel, including among others section commander rank officers, will assist the MMC enforcement squad.”

Gandhinagar: The deadly coronavirus outbreak in China has led the Gujarat government convene a meeting of district CDHOs and municipal corporation health officers two days ago. Since Monday, the state commissioner of health instructed that prior to the intimation from central health authorities, infrastructure and the manpower required for screening fevers be readied.

“The principal focus will be city airports. Since there are no direct flights to or from China in Gujarat, we will be dependent on inputs from metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi,” says a senior state health official.

The authorities also discussed whether there were previous cases of the viral disease in neighbouring states or in Gujarat. The official also added that the paramedic staff required for patient care in the wake of an epidemic has been earmarked. “The WHO has already instituted a protocol which is widely followed and we plan to rely on it till further intimation from the central health authorities,” adds the official.

He added that Gujarat authorities are closely studying the handling of Kerala’s Nipah virus outbreak to control spread of the virus. “We have made provisions for isolation wards in major city hospitals across the state,” adds the official.

391,['23/01/2020'],"50% of female sex workers face violence, finds survey","This story is from January 23, 2020

Representative image

TRICHY: A survey of female sex workers (FSWs) conducted by an NGO has brought to light the adversities they face in their line of work and personal life for choosing sex work as a form of livelihood.

According to the survey conducted among 1,000 women sex workers in Tamil Nadu , Karnataka and Pune in 2019 by South India AIDS Action Programme (SIAAP), 50% of them face some form of violence. The objective of the study was to assess the impact of the sex work on the quality of their life.

“Most of them face domestic violence from the family members, particularly husbands for earning through sex work to make ends meet. Violence from customers is very less. Some clients would refuse to use condoms leading to arguments and violence,” project officer of SIAAP Janani Venkatesh told ToI in Trichy on Tuesday on the sidelines of a press conference.

Almost 46% sex workers (TN – 40%, Karnataka – 9 % and Pune 5 %) have experienced violence in the last six months. However, only 2% of them, sex workers from Tamil Nadu, took legal action because they fear that they will be arrested for indulging in sex work though it is not illegal and done without violating the clauses of Immoral Traffic (prevention) Act, 1956.

Out of the 1,000 FSWs, the survey covered 398 FSWs in Tamil Nadu, while the rest were from the two states.

The survey also revealed the story of some FSWs facing violence from police, healthcare providers, clients, rowdies and pimps, but most of them avoid taking legal action fearing negative consequences.

As per the survey, 40% doctors did not like to treat sex workers because it would reduce their clientele.

District program manager (DPM) Dr S M Manivannan of the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), Trichy, was of the view that the introduction of several government programmes to sensitize the FSWs prevents them from being at the mercy of any doctors outside. “Our programs clearly cover their needs. They get sensitization from our staff and get regular treatments at sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics to prevent them from being infected by HIV,” he told ToI.

The survey also elaborated about the empowerment of the FSWs through sex work to face life more confidently to help their peers. The study also had detailed information of the healthcare of the FSWs.

Senior officials from the social welfare department said that they are planning to come up with a separate policy to protect the rights of women sex workers in the state, so that they can avail medical care, legal aid and other benefits provided to women without being excluded.

“The state also has Ujjawala homes, which is meant to help women sex workers. Those in-charges of these homes are regularly conducting awareness programmes. But they can also help only when the workers come forward,” the official said. Ujjawala homes are also meant to provide rescue and rehabilitation facilities to sex workers. However, there are only six such homes in the state. Officials said that the risks involved in running such homes have been deterring organisations from taking up the task.

“If the state agencies did their duties they wouldn’t be struggling this way. But sadly, authorities too are still stuck in the medieval era, where they look down on these women,” said Sujata Mody, president of Penn Thozhilalargal Sangam. Sujata further elaborated on the stigma associated with them and criminalisation they face in their daily lives, with very little or no help from the state.

“In countries such as Norway and Sweden it’s illegal to seek paid sex, but here the victims are criminalised no matter what the situation is. These women are adults and should be allowed to do what they want, and they want dignity and acceptance,” she said.

Isabel Richardson, director of Madras Christian Council of Social Service, the lone Ujjawala home in Chennai, said that most workers came to them seeking alternative employment and rehabilitation. “From our experience we have seen that women are mostly forced into this job by their kin and they are often exploited, they go into depression, substance addiction, etc. And they all want to come out of it and lead a better life.”

392,['23/01/2020'],LED bulbs of required watt to be installed before Feb 28: Kalshetti,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Kolhapur: The action of blacklisting the firm appointed for installation of 24,000 LED bulbs across the city has been deferred by a month.

The proposal to blacklist Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) was tabled before the corporators for the approval after the recommendation of the standing committee.

The previous state government had made it mandatory for civic bodies to appoint EESL for installing LED lights. At the time, the corporators had objected to this; however, since the decision was taken by the state government, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) entered into an agreement with EESL.

During the agreement, the corporators had suggested that the bulbs to be fitted on the poles should be based on the width of the road. For instance, they suggested that LED bulb of 75 watt should be installed for roads with width more than nine meters.

However, the corporators claimed that the bulbs of less watt were installed, leading to black spots on roads. They also said that several accidents took place on major roads in the city owing to these black spots.

Sharangdhar Deshmukh, chairman of standing committee, said, “The committee recommended the blacklisting of the firm due to fault in their work. We have found that at least 50% of the bulbs fitted by the firm have less watt than prescribed by us. The road passing through some wards is illuminated unevenly owing to the LED bulbs of uneven watt. We want this firm to be blacklisted and the appointment of a new firm by the civic administration. If that is not possible, we have our own engineers and staff members to take the project forward. We have observed that in one day, civic staff can fit 130 bulbs. On the other hand, this firm has not been able to install even 30 bulbs in a day.”

Congress corporator Bhupal Shete said that by the end of seven years when the contract ends, the KMC will end up paying Rs 40 crore more to the firm which means equal amount will be lost by civic body. He also said that the the municipal corporation can complete the project in just Rs 4 crore.

While many corporators supported blacklisting of the firm, some claimed that blacklisting will not do any good.

Ajit Thanekar, Bharatiya Janata Party’s leader in the KMC, said, “It is the municipal corporation’s responsibility to get the work done. I do not know why this big step to blacklist the firm is proposed? There are other projects too that have been stuck. No good company will be ready to take up the projects.”

Bareilly: A 40-year-old man, who was lodged in district jail of Budaun, was allegedly found in an unconscious state in the prison barrack on Wednesday. He was later declared dead at a district hospital.

The superintendent of district jail claimed that the man was not physically assaulted as there were no injury marks on his body. According to him, the man may have died of heart attack. Police have sent his body for postmortem.

Notably, when prison staff opened the barrack in the morning, they reportedly found the man in unconscious state. The doctor at jail referred him to district hospital where he died.

According to jail officials, Mukesh, son of Ram Bharose and a resident of Kinhapur village under Ujhani police station of Budaun, was lodged in district jail here on January 10. He was booked under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 427 (mischief causing damage), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance), 504 (intentional insult with intention to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation).

District jail superintendent Aditya Kumar said, “Mukesh never complained of any illness when he was lodged in the jail. When our staff went to open the barrack, they saw Mukesh ‘sleeping’ with his face covered with a bedsheet. When they tried to wake him up, they found that he was unconscious.”

Kumar further said, “The doctor at jail referred him to district hospital where he died. He was not physically assaulted as there were no injury marks on his body. We suspect that he died of heart attack. We are awaiting postmortem report to ascertain the cause of death and further measures will be taken accordingly.”

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: “Women in Gujarat and in India have not written their own exclusive histories when it came to issues of emancipation or social movements, like the feminist movement of the West. Instead they have shared their space with men in their struggle,” says Shirin Mehta, historian, scholar and teacher, whose mammoth effort of chronicled the role of Gujarat women’s — including the subaltern, depressed classes and Adivasis — in social reforms and freedon movement.

She argues in her new 728-page Gujarati book titled, ‘Gujarat Ma Narichetana ane Vanchit Mahilao No Padkar’ (women’s emancipation in Gujarat and the role of subaltern women), that Mahatma Gandhi is often credited with drawing women into social and freedom movements, but Mehta says, “Women’s participation in these movements was not sudden nor accidental. It was the culmination of a series of ideas and institutional developments that had preceded the Gandhian era,” says Mehta. The event was attended by economist Yogendra Alagh, Lord Bhikhu Parekh, Gandhi scholar Tridip Suhrud and writer Kumarpal Desai.

In her book, Mehta resurrects Dalit women like Shanta Vankar, the 10-year-old girl Bhuri and Hari Vaghri from the 1874 industrial commission inquiry, where these women had come out to complain against the poor working conditions in the textile mills. In 1891, women from the Devipujak, Koli, Muslim and Bavcha communities, along with their men and children took out a protest rally against low wages and retrenchment.

UDAIPUR: His family opposed the idea and relatives and friends ridiculed him. But nothing deterred this 46-year-old man to name his only son ‘Congress’ who was born after 22 years of marriage.Vinod Jain, a building material supplier in Udaipur and a staunch Congress worker, has been ecstatic after receiving the birth certificate of his six-month-old son recently.Jain faced severe opposition from his two college going daughters Prarthana and Priyanshi who were very excited to get a little brother after so many years. “It is natural and rightful on their part to nurture a desire to name their baby brother. So, they were quite upset when I announced my decision to name him ‘Congress’. They quarrelled with me over the name and even did not speak to me for days but I was adamant and managed to convince them,” Jain said. The idea struck him from the BJP punchline- “Congress Mukta Bharat”. “Today, I have named my child and in the coming years, many others may do the same because ideas spread like fire. Congress ideology will never die,” said Jain.His wife Vandana was understanding, he claimed, as she knew his dedication towards the party and hence stood by his decision. He has been receiving congratulatory calls ever since the birth certificate has gone viral on the social media.“It may sound weird or funny today, but it is my gut feeling that soon, the Congress party would regain its glory and make a remarkable comeback.

398,['23/01/2020'],Hi-tech corridor: Nod for draft shareholders’ pact,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The state cabinet on Wednesday approved the draft shareholders’ agreement for developing the high-tech industrial corridor from Palakkad to Kochi.

The shareholders’ agreement will be inked between the state and national industrial corridor development and implementation trust (NICDIT) under the ministry of commerce and industry. The hi-tech industrial corridor is part of the extension of Bengaluru-Chennai corridor to Kochi, via Coimbatore. The length of the corridor from Kochi to Coimbatore is 160km. There will be six integrated manufacturing clusters (IMCs) in this corridor. In the corridor at Palakkad, food processing, rubber, electronics, general machinery and electrical machinery industries will be given top priorities.

The cabinet had last week decided to acquire 1,351 acres for setting up the IMC at a cost of Rs 1,038 crore through Kerala infrastructure investment fund board (KIIFB) in Palakkad for the project. Land will be acquired at Kannambra-Alathur, Puthussery-Chittoor, Uzhalapathy-Chittoor and Kanjikode. The state government’s request for extending the corridor to Kochi was earlier cleared by NICDIT.

The government expects to attract an investment of more than Rs 10,000 crore to the IMC and create more than 10,000 jobs. The project is envisaged to be run by a special purpose vehicle formed jointly by the state and Centre. The state’s investment will be the land while the Centre will develop it.

The cabinet on Wednesday also decided to give approval to Kerala urban service delivery project to strengthen institutional and service delivery systems of urban local bodies in the state, in such a way that World Bank funds can be provided to local bodies for the project, in addition to the Plan funds. The World Bank has agreed to provide Rs 2,100 crore as loan at 2% interest for 25 years for the project.

Physical investments will take place in a limited number of medium or small cities (with population less than 1 lakh), which have not received previous support for reforms and service delivery under national schemes like JNNURM and Amrut.

401,['23/01/2020'],"In a 1st, passengers of Ahd-Mumbai Tejas to get Rs 100 each for train delay","This story is from January 23, 2020

Mumbai: In a first for the city’s railway network, around 630 passengers of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai Tejas Express are eligible to a compensation of Rs 100 each for a delay of more than 80 minutes on the train ’s run to Mumbai Central on Wednesday.

Tejas Express is the only class of trains on Indian Railways whose passengers are eligible for compensation in case of a delay—Rs 100 if a train is late by more than one hour and Rs 250 in case of two hours. This is the second instance in the country of passengers of Tejas Express getting compensated. In October 2019, 950 passengers of the Delhi-Lucknow Tejas Express got Rs 250 each after the train reached it destination three hours late.

In the Ahmedabad-Mumbai train’s case, Western Railway services were affected after a technical problem in the over head equipment between Mira Road and Bhayander from 12.38pm to 1.30pm, which threw Churchgate-bound fast trains off schedule. As a result, four long-distance trains, including Tejas Express, were delayed too. IRCTC public relations officer said, “The train got delayed due to a problem in an over head electric wire. Passengers are entitled to a compensation of Rs 100 as the train was delayed by over 75 minutes.”

Passengers must make a claim for refund . IRCTC has estimated around 630 passengers are eligible for compensation. Passengers can call 1800-266-8844 or email irctcclaim@libertyinsurance.in. They must submit their PNR number along with the insurance number and a cancelled cheque. The claim will be processed within a day of submission of these details.

IRCTC offers travel insurance to passengers of Tejas Express through Liberty General Insurance Company.

Tejas Express was flagged off from Ahmedabad on January 17. This the first time that compensation for delay is being paid for it.

Tejas Express also took an unscheduled halt at Andheri as several passengers feared they would miss their flight due to the delay. IRCTC official said, “Some passengers who had a flight to catch requested us for an unscheduled halt at Andheri station. Based on their request, the train was halted at Andheri station for two minutes.”

402,['23/01/2020'],KMC drafts Rs7.55cr plan to upgrade pumping stations,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has drafted a proposal of Rs 7.55 crore for upgrading all three pumping stations and improving city’s water supply system.

During the general body meeting of the KMC held on Wednesday, the corporators claimed that water supply in their localities has been irregular for the last few months. Most of the corporators who complained about poor supply were from E ward and internal parts of the city.

They claimed that supply of water has stopped in many areas for the last four to six days and demanded starting alternate day supply to ensure every part of the city gets adequate supply.

The water supply department had tabled a proposal of utilising Rs 60 lakh for emergency repairs of the water treatment plants located in the city. Last month, a delegation of corporators had visited the water treatment plants (WTP) and found that the main reason for supply of contaminated water was decline in the efficiency of the WTPs

Satyajit Kadam, Tararani Aghadi corporator, said, “No water is being supplied in the E ward. Every time we are told that there is some technical glitch at the pumping station.”

Shekhar Kusale, another corporator, claimed that carrying out repair works will not work. “In order to ensure continuous supply the pumping stations at Balinga and Nagdevwadi should be upgraded immediately. We had requested drafting of estimates for the work since the last three months but nothing has been done yet.”

In the last three months, water supply has been cut for at least four to eight days a month owing to shutting of pumping stations. Next week, the KMC has planned another water cut that may last for two days for repairing the pumping stations.

Responding to the concerns, the civic officials in the meeting claimed that another proposal of Rs 7.55 crore is ready with the KMC through which the pumping stations will be upgraded and new pumps and systems will be installed.

Madurai: The officials from the engineering wing of Madurai Corporation said that works are expected to begin in the first week of February and all the bitumen laying works will be completed in two months. It will take one month more for the paver block roads to be completed.

The tender procedures were already over and the pre-bid meeting has also been conducted. Officials said that bids will be opened in the presence of bidders on January 28 and tenders would be awarded to the chosen bidders.

“We will provide three months’ time for the contractor to complete bitumen laying work and paver block roads. One more month leniency can be given for the projects taken up at places, where works are affected due to the upcoming Chithirai festival,” said an official from engineering wing.

Officials said that once a road is laid, the same road cannot be taken for re-laying for 5 years. Contractor’s defect liability duration is only for one year. The contractor can be pulled up for liability if the road gets damaged in the first year.

Bareilly: A 40-year-old man, who was lodged in district jail of Budaun, was allegedly found in an unconscious state in the prison barrack on Wednesday. He was later declared dead at a district hospital.

The superintendent of district jail claimed that the man was not physically assaulted as there were no injury marks on his body. According to him, the man may have died of heart attack. Police have sent his body for postmortem.

Notably, when prison staff opened the barrack in the morning, they reportedly found the man in unconscious state. The doctor at jail referred him to district hospital where he died.

According to jail officials, Mukesh, son of Ram Bharose and a resident of Kinhapur village under Ujhani police station of Budaun, was lodged in district jail here on January 10. He was booked under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 427 (mischief causing damage), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance), 504 (intentional insult with intention to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation).

District jail superintendent Aditya Kumar said, “Mukesh never complained of any illness when he was lodged in the jail. When our staff went to open the barrack, they saw Mukesh ‘sleeping’ with his face covered with a bedsheet. When they tried to wake him up, they found that he was unconscious.”

Kumar further said, “The doctor at jail referred him to district hospital where he died. He was not physically assaulted as there were no injury marks on his body. We suspect that he died of heart attack. We are awaiting postmortem report to ascertain the cause of death and further measures will be taken accordingly.”

BMC headquarters

MUMBAI: The BMC ’s civic works committee, which had changed its study tour venue from Andaman Islands to Chandigarh last week following the BJP’s opposition, reopened the proposal on Wednesday and reverted to its original plan with a majority vote. It will now visit Andaman as was planned earlier.

The works committee had initially intended to visit Andaman to study their drainage system but the BJP had taken strong objection to the expenditure citing reduced BMC tax collections. A Shiv Sena member in the committee had then suggested that the venue be changed to Chandigarh and the proposal was cleared despite the BJP’s opposition.

Several members were not happy with the change, though, and insisted that they visit Andaman. An urgent meeting was called on Wednesday to reopen last week’s proposal. The works committee cancelled the Chandigarh tour proposal and brought back the earlier Andaman plan on board. The members voted with 17 from the Sena, Congress and NCP supporting the Andaman proposal and seven from the BJP opposing it.

Kanira Dalal, 18, student, resident of Bodakdev

“I did not really know that blocking the left turn is a traffic offence, but it seems like a genuine issue. I feel that everyone should be careful on the road as these rules are for our safety only. Especially with the number of deaths due to negligent driving increasing, one should follow the rules properly.”

Krishna Parmar, 24, taxi-driver, resident of Nehrunagar

“I knew about the rule but I did not know what it is called. People know that they should not block the left side so there is no need to impose a hefty penalty. Sometimes people stop on the left side as they are in a hurry. Besides, if a person does not see anyone coming from behind, then he would stop his vehicle on the left side.

Parth Vaishnav, 28, private firm employee, resident of Paldi

“It is not a rule everyone knows about, like the helmet or over speeding. But it causes a lot of trouble if it is not followed. The authorities should make people aware about the rules and regulations. Stricter action taken against offenders will automatically lower their numbers.”

KOLHAPUR: Action against illegal transport in the city is expected soon.

The corporators raised the concerns related to the illegal mode of transport and its effect on the revenue of the Kolhapur Municipal Transport (KMT) during a meeting of the general body of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Wednesday.

They claimed that the KMT is financially weak and certain steps need to be taken to make the transport utility financially viable.

Shiv Sena corporator Niyaz Khan, who is a former chairman of the transport committee, said, “Around 2,000 people directly depend on the KMT for their livelihood. The KMT is making huge losses. Since the new chief of the KMT is from the transport office, we expect him to take effective action against the illegal transport, especially autorickshaws.”

The KMT officials too agree that the illegal transport is causing decline in the passenger count of their buses. The autodrivers pick up passengers waiting at the KMC bus stops even though they have their own separate stop.

At present, the KMT is making losses in tune of Rs 2.5 lakh per day. The KMC grants funds to the KMT for paying the salaries of the drivers and ticket collectors.

Subhash Desai, transport inspector and newly-appointed additional manager of the KMT, said, “Soon, corporators will witness change in operations of the KMT. We will take all measures suggested by them and those of urgent necessity.”

Some corporators welcomed Desai and said he was the first person having sound knowledge and experience of the transport systems to be appointed as the additional manager of KMT.

Khan claimed that there were limitations in effective management of the KMT when civic officials headed it and there was lack of expertise.

NEW DELHI: To avoid glitches due to “mishandling” of electronic voting machines and voter verified paper audit trail, the Delhi election office has prepared a “catalogue of errors”.A senior official said the catalogue had been prepared on the basis of “hands-on experience” of the officials in the 2019 Lok Sabha election in Delhi when VVPATs were used for the first time at all booths. The catalogue will serve as a dos and don’ts guide for over 80,000 polling staff entrusted with the responsibility of conducting elections at 2,700-odd booths where votes will be cast to elect the 70-member Delhi assembly.According to officials, several “distress” calls were made by presiding officers and polling teams to the central control room while setting up the polling booths during the parliamentary election in May last year. VVPAT , which is considered a sensitive machine, and EVMs malfunctioned at several places and were replaced before the voting began.The polling teams also forgot to delete the records of the mock poll before the actual polling started, which forced EC to order a re-poll at one booth, while at four other stations, the paper trail and the EVM data had to be separately matched. This had delayed the counting process. At some places, the polling teams found it difficult to connect the two equipment.“VVPAT has to be handled carefully. It cannot be kept under direct sunlight. While transporting, it has to be carried vertically. It also reacts to the climatic conditions. All these things have been included in the catalogue, which will be given to the polling officials during their training slated to start next week,” a senior election official said. About 1,000 sector officers have been trained under Phase 1.The polling teams also erred in completing the paperwork before the start of the voting process and while handing over EVM machines at the strong rooms.

KOCHI: Ajit Haridas , chairman of the Kerala pollution control board has resigned from the board citing ‘absence of an enabling environment’. A special board meeting on December 27 had passed a resolution expressing lack of confidence in the chairman, whom they accused of taking unilateral decisions without consulting board members.

According to board sources, Haridas was in trouble for inviting the CPM’s wrath after the board issued a notice to Thiruvananthapuram corporation in October last year asking it to pay an environmental compensation of Rs 14.5 crore under the polluter pays principle. What angered the party was the timing of the notice: CPM was fighting a crucial bypoll and V K Prasanth popularly known as ‘Mayor Bro’ was the candidate in Vattiyoorkkavu constituency.

Ajit Haridas could not be reached for a comment but his resegnition was confirmed by principal secretary in charge of environment Usha Titus. While the resignation letter did not elaborate on the reasons behind the resignation, a covering letter attached to it denied the allegations raised against him as vague and unspecific.

Nashik: City traffic police has written to the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ), asking them to remove the encroachments in Nepali Corner area of the city which is hindering smooth flow of vehicular traffic.

“Hundreds of hawkers occupy the road at Nepali Corner near Regional Referral Hospital,” a senior official of the city traffic branch said, adding that they have communicated with the civic officials to start an anti-encroachment drive in the area.

Police inspector Bharatkumar Suryawanshi of the city traffic branch said, “The Nepali Corner area has huge flow of vehicular traffic from the Main Road area. However, due to encroachment there is hardly any space left for vehicular traffic. In view of this, we have communicated with the NMC to take up the anti-encroachment drive.”

Suryawanshi has been appointed as a special officer of the city traffic branch for streamlining vehicular traffic at Ashok Stambh, Raviwar Karanja, Shalimar, Nepali Corner, Ramkund area and other congested parts in the old city.

“Our aim is also to do away with encroachments around Nehru Garden area that becomes crowded during the evening hours,” he said.

“The entire compound of Nehru Garden is surrounded by vendors during the evening hours, while the roads have busy traffic movement. These encroachments pose a major obstacle for the movement of vehicular traffic on account of which we have also suggested to take up an anti-encroachment drive around Nehru Garden as well,” he added.

Suryawanshi said they have removed encroachment from Shivaji Garden area along the Shalimar-CBS road which has eased the movement of traffic to some extent.

“The traffic police have started taking strict action against those violating the no-entry norm from Nehru Garden towards Shivaji Road area. Apart from booking motorists for violating the no-entry rule, we are also penalizing those riding two-wheelers without helmets,” he said.

Areas like Shalimar, CBS and Red Cross Signal witness heavy traffic throughout the day and encroachment is a serious issue in these areas. “We are communicating the infrastructure problems with the NMC so that the roads are made clutter-free for smooth flow of traffic,” he said.

Last year, over 300 schools had registered for admissions under the RTE. As per the act, economically and socially disadvantaged children, as well as those with disabilities, can be admitted in Class I or at pre-primary stage of private, aided and unaided schools. These children receive free education, including textbooks and other facilities.

NEW DELHI: To avoid glitches due to “mishandling” of electronic voting machines and voter verified paper audit trail, the Delhi election office has prepared a “catalogue of errors”.

A senior official said the catalogue had been prepared on the basis of “hands-on experience” of the officials in the 2019 Lok Sabha election in Delhi when VVPATs were used for the first time at all booths. The catalogue will serve as a dos and don’ts guide for over 80,000 polling staff entrusted with the responsibility of conducting elections at 2,700-odd booths where votes will be cast to elect the 70-member Delhi assembly.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

According to officials, several “distress” calls were made by presiding officers and polling teams to the central control room while setting up the polling booths during the parliamentary election in May last year. VVPAT, which is considered a sensitive machine, and EVMs malfunctioned at several places and were replaced before the voting began.

The polling teams also forgot to delete the records of the mock poll before the actual polling started, which forced EC to order a re-poll at one booth, while at four other stations, the paper trail and the EVM data had to be separately matched. This had delayed the counting process. At some places, the polling teams found it difficult to connect the two equipment.

“VVPAT has to be handled carefully. It cannot be kept under direct sunlight. While transporting, it has to be carried vertically. It also reacts to the climatic conditions. All these things have been included in the catalogue, which will be given to the polling officials during their training slated to start next week,” a senior election official said. About 1,000 sector officers have been trained under Phase 1.

The polling teams also erred in completing the paperwork before the start of the voting process and while handing over EVM machines at the strong rooms. EC has also decided to dispatch teams a day before and has made arrangements for their lodging and food at the polling booths.

Nashik: Police on Wednesday seized gutka worth Rs 42.71 lakh from a truck in Gaulane village on the outskirts of the city.

“DCP Vijay Kharat of zone II received information that a truck loaded with gutka has come from Gujarat and was on its way to Mumbai. After verifying the information, police laid a trap at Gaulane village and intercepted the truck,” a police officer said.

“The truck driver said that he was told that the place where gutka was to be delivered would be given told to him after reaching Bhiwandi. An offence has been registered against the suspect driver under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006,” the officer said.

PUNE: This year’s Republic Day won’t be as cold as was forecast earlier. So, the extra woollies people may have pulled out can be stashed away for now.The likely formation of an upper air cyclonic circulation at a lower atmospheric level over Maharashtra has partially negated the state’s chances of experiencing a significant fall in the night or minimum temperature till the month end.In fact, Shivajinagar and Lohegaon recorded their highest day temperature on Wednesday for this month at 31.4 degrees celsius (1.3 degrees above the normal) and 31.3 degrees celsius (1.3 degrees above the normal) respectively.Shivajinagar also registered the second highest night temperature for January on Wednesday at 15.3 degrees celsius. The highest was on January 8 at 17.4 degrees celsius.The India Meteorological Department had forecast a drop in the minimum temperatures to single digits across Maharashtra around Republic Day between January 25 and 27.Though the minimum temperature may fall to some extent on January 25 in the northern parts of the state, it may rise after that and there seems to be less possibility of a significant fall in night temperature till the month-end.Such weather conditions may keep night temperatures above the normal for some time and chances of a fall below 10 degrees celsius is unlikely.Already, parts of the state, including Pune, are experiencing a rise in humidity levels as well as night temperatures. With day temperatures having crossed 30 degrees celsius, a warmer than normal winter could be experienced in the state for the next few days though the nights will record marginally low temperature in the morning from January 23 to 25.Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune told TOI that partial clouding in the morning and the evening that keeps night temperatures warm may reduce slowly from January 23-25. Minimum temperature may fall gradually, but not below 10 degrees celsius , he said.“January 26-27 may again register a marginal rise in minimums due to various weather systems, including an anti-cyclone over Rajasthan and adjoining Madhya Pradesh, a trough-line forming over South Maharashtra and an upper cyclonic circulation over Rajasthan. All these factors will change the wind pattern over most parts of the state to southeasterly, southerly and easterly, which are warm and moist winds,” Kashyapi added.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73539228,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-131764,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/changing-wind-pattern-blows-away-colder-nights-forecast/articleshow/73530533.cms

KOLHAPUR: A 52-year-old woman was killed and four others injured in a road accident at Shiroli phata area on Pune-Bengaluru national highway at wee hours on Wednesday.

The injured have been shifted to the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) civil hospital and are under observation, said the police.

The deceased, identified as 52-year-old Savita Shantinath Bedkihale was a resident of Bhoj village, Chikkodi taluka, district Belgaum, Karnataka.

According to the police, all the passengers are relatives and were resident of Karnataka. Two of them are from Hatkanangle taluka. On Tuesday, they had gone to Pune to meet one of their relatives and left for their home on Tuesday night.

“At around 3am, when the car arrived at Sangli phata, Shiroli Pulachi on Pune-Bangalore national highway, the driver lost control of the vehicle and rammed into the tractor trolley carrying sugar cane, which was going on the left lane. Savita died on the spot and others including the driver sustained injuries. With the help of the passers-by, we admitted them into the hospital and they are under observation,” said a police officer attached with Shiroli MIDC police station.

“The tractor was on its way to Jawahar cooperative mill, Hupari, and the initial investigation suggests that the tractor was travelling on the left lane but the driver of the car lost his control and rammed into the trolley,” he said.

Satyawan Dashrath Budhawale (20), who is a resident of Mhaswad, Satara district, driver of the tractor lodged a complaint in this regard.

Police have booked the driver of the car for rash driving. Several sections of IPC including section 304 (A) (Causing death by negligence), 279 (Rash driving or riding on a public way), 337 (Causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (Causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and section 184 of the Motor Vehicle Act have been invoked against him.

The issue has again highlighted the importance of reflectors for the vehicles which carry canes during the night. Police are investigating if the tractor had put reflectors on the backside of the trolley, as per the rule.

Praveen and Saranya with their kids Sreebadra (9), Aarcha (7) and Abhinav (3)

KOZHIKODE: Seven-year-old Madhav , the sole surviving member of his family, reached Nedumbassery airport late on Wednesday night without knowing that the tragedy in Nepal had claimed the lives of his parents ( Ranjith Kumar and Indu Lakshmi) and younger brother Vyshnav (2). He survived as he slept in another room at Everest Panorama Resort in Nepal’s Daman during the fateful night.

Madhav had gone to sleep as soon as the four families checked in at the resort in Nepal on Monday night. As it was biting cold at the popular tourist destination, his parents and his brother went to their family friend Praveen’s room where a heater was available.

The child, who is unaware of the tragic chain of events, was brought to New Delhi from Nepal by some members of the travelling group. Madhav’s uncle Aneesh, who is serving in the Army in Uttar Pradesh, received him in Delhi and accompanied him on the flight from Delhi to Nedumbassery (via Bengaluru). They are expected to reach Madhav's maternal home at Mukavoor early on Thursday.His family had flown to Delhi for the holiday trip from Nedumbassery on Friday.

Aneesh told over the phone from New Delhi airport that Madhav was continuously asking about his parents and younger brother. “We haven’t told him about the incident despite his repeated queries. He is asking for his parents and younger brother,” he said. Aneesh is the husband of Chitra Lakshmi, Indu’s sister.

Ranjith Kumar’s brother-in-law Peethambaran said that the child was told that his parents would be coming home in another flight very soon. Relatives back home in Kunnamangalam are at pains on how they would console the little child when he would see the bodies of his parents and brother on Friday.

Madhav's class teacher Simmi S Nair from Silver Hills Public School in Kozhikode where he is studying in Class-II said that the kid had told her a lot about his trip during class last Thursday.

“When I made the announcement in the class on Thursday that all students should wear school uniform for the annual day programme on Saturday, Madhav came to me and said that he will not be there for the event as he and his family were going on a pleasure trip to Delhi. So I wished him a happy and memorable trip,” she said.

She said that Madhav's parents had shown keen interest and involvement in his studies.

Rampur: Administration in UP’s Rampur on Wednesday took the possession of 104-bigha land inside Mohammad Ali Jauhar University campus on the directions of revenue board court in Prayagraj, which has found that rules were flouted while purchasing the patch of lands from a bunch of Dalit farmers.

When contacted, Deepak Saxena, government counsel at board of revenue in Prayagraj, said, “Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act bars small land-owning Dalits from transferring their land to non-Scheduled Castes. And if they do, it has to be approved by the district administration.” No such permission was taken by the Jauhar Trust, run by local MP and senior Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan.

“The revenue board had quashed the order of the Moradabad Commissioner court, which had granted permission for sale of the land in 2013,” Saxena said.

On Wednesday afternoon, the administration also sealed a semi-constructed building inside the varsity campus over non-payment of Cess.

Led by Rampur’s sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Prem Prakash Tiwari, a team of officials reached the campus and started the procedure to seize the building and confiscate the land.

Rampur’s district magistrate (DM) Aunjaneya Kumar Singh told TOI, “The process to take the possession of the land was started after we received a copy from the board of revenue, which found that Jauhar Trust flouted the UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act while acquiring 104-bigha land.”

The officials also seized a building of the university.

The DM added, “One of the buildings of Mohammad Ali Jauhar University has also been seized after the Jauhar Trust failed to deposit a cess of Rs 1.37 crore for the construction of the varsity.”

Under the Building And Other Construction Workers Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service Act 1996, all buildings, above the cost of Rs 10 lakh, constructed in the state have to pay a cess of 1% to the board that spends it on welfare measures for workers.

The DM added, “The officials went to seize the administrative block of the university, but the vice chancellor Sultan Mohammad Khan said that seizure of the administrative block will hit ongoing examination. So, the decision was taken to seize some other building.”

The university, whose chancellor is Azam Khan, was established in 2006. Spread in over 500 acres, it is run by Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar Trust.

PUNE: Dense fog in north India, especially in Delhi and the NCR region, triggered the delay of 10 flights — both inbound and departing — at the Lohegaon airport on Wednesday morning.

NASHIK: The health department undertook the mop-up round of the national pulse polio drive across the district on Tuesday to adminster the dose to those children who were left out in the earlier drive conducted across the city and district on January 19.

While the mop-up round in the rural areas will be held for three days, in the city limits, the vaccination round will be held for five days, said health officials.

The district health department said that the National Pulse Polio Campaign was held across the district with more than 10,000 health workers and officers working for the success of the campaign.

The aim was to administer polio dose to over 4.57 lakh children below the age of five years in the city as well as the district. To serve this purpose, 3,561 booths were set up all over the district.

Senior health officials said that they set the target of administering polio dose to 4,57,860 children and that the department achieved 95% of the said target.

Health workers said that they will visit every household to check if any child under the age of five has been left out in the pulse polio drive.

Officials said that the pulse polio campaign was implemented in the state since 1995.

Meanwhile, due to the huge success of the government in administering polio doses to children below five years of age, not a single case of polio was detected in the country after January 2011, following which India was declared as a polio-free nation in March 2014.

PUNE: The Maharashtra State Cooperative ( MSC ) Bank and the Rupee Cooperative Bank have submitted a joint merger proposal to the RBI , giving hope to over half-a-million depositors of the Pune bank.

The proposal was submitted on January 17. Bankers said the RBI could take about six months to give its approval to the merger.

The proposal, if approved by the RBI, will grant relief to over half-a-million depositors of the Rupee Cooperative Bank whose deposits have been stuck since the bank was put under RBI directions in February 2013.

The two banks said the depositors would not lose any money due to the merger. “Those with less than Rs 1 lakh in deposits can withdraw the amount within the first year of merger in five tranches of 20% each time at a gap of two months between two withdrawals. And those with over Rs 1 lakh in deposits can withdraw their money over five years in slabs of 20%/year,” the MSC Bank said in a statement.

Vidhyadhar Anaskar, chairman, MSC Bank, told TOI that the RBI wanted the two banks to submit a joint proposal so that the process can move fast.

MSC Bank said it would give 6.5% interest or higher prevailing rates on the deposits kept with it after the merger. “This will be the best possible option for the depositors. A liquidation might have meant that those with more than Rs 1 lakh in deposits get only 35% of it,” Sudhir Pandit, chairman of the board of administrators, Rupee Cooperative Bank, said.

A large number of voters gathered outside the Kareeriya Government Upper Primary School and shouted slogans against local MLA Safiya Khan and Congress leader Zuber Khan.

Due to this, people were not coming to vote out of fear, they said.

Most of the candidates in New Delhi have categorised themselves as private company employees, housewives, NGO workers and many even as unemployed people. Of the hopefuls, 14 are women and an overwhelming 52 will fight the February 8 poll as independents.Complete Coverage on Delhi ElectionsOn the day of scrutiny of the papers on Wednesday, three nominations had been rejected till late night. The process was still under way.Contestant Ajay Tiwari, 36, is a garments businessman from Gandhi Nagar in east Delhi. He is a member of the Right to Recall Party. “We want to create a system in which a voter passbook is maintained and any voter can recall his/her vote in the municipal, assembly or parliamentary elections,” Tiwari explained. “The power in such a system is vested in a voter, not the party.”Among the independents, Pradeep Kumar, a mechanic who makes mechanical grinders to process spices, revealed that he did not have a permanent home but moved from place to place to find work. “I live wherever I get an order to fabricate a grinder,” Kumar said, and to explain why he is a candidate, said, “We are tired of Kejriwal. Everyone has a right to fight elections and I am standing against him because I had hoped his nomination would be cancelled.”Some of the nominees could not be contacted on the number provided in their affidavits. AAP had alleged on Tuesday that the extraordinary queue to file papers was a BJP ruse to delay the chief minister’s submission.Also in the reckoning were the customary mavericks, among them Daya Shankar Agarwal, 70, who said he was a retired professor from Delhi University’s PGDAV College. Last year, he sought to fight Modi from Varanasi, but his papers were rejected. “I also filed my nomination to challenge Pranab Mukherjee and Ram Nath Kovind in the presidential elections,” Agarwal said.The septuagenarian added that he was not fighting against Arvind Kejriwal, but for Delhi. “I was there when AAP party was launched, but it has failed in its ideals. Everyone has a goal when they arrive on prithvi lok (earth), and my goal is to take on a failing AAP,” Agarwal declared.Overall, 1,029 people filed 1,528 sets of nomination papers in the 70 constituencies, of whom 278, or 27%, were women.

Most of the candidates in New Delhi have categorised themselves as private company employees, housewives, NGO workers and many even as unemployed people. Of the hopefuls, 14 are women and an overwhelming 52 will fight the February 8 poll as independents.On the day of scrutiny of the papers on Wednesday, three nominations had been rejected till late night. The process was still under way.Contestant Ajay Tiwari, 36, is a garments businessman from Gandhi Nagar in east Delhi. He is a member of the Right to Recall Party. “We want to create a system in which a voter passbook is maintained and any voter can recall his/her vote in the municipal, assembly or parliamentary elections,” Tiwari explained. “The power in such a system is vested in a voter, not the party.”Among the independents, Pradeep Kumar, a mechanic who makes mechanical grinders to process spices, revealed that he did not have a permanent home but moved from place to place to find work. “I live wherever I get an order to fabricate a grinder,” Kumar said, and to explain why he is a candidate, said, “We are tired of Kejriwal. Everyone has a right to fight elections and I am standing against him because I had hoped his nomination would be cancelled.”Some of the nominees could not be contacted on the number provided in their affidavits. AAP had alleged on Tuesday that the extraordinary queue to file papers was a BJP ruse to delay the chief minister’s submission.Also in the reckoning were the customary mavericks, among them Daya Shankar Agarwal, 70, who said he was a retired professor from Delhi University’s PGDAV College. Last year, he sought to fight Modi from Varanasi, but his papers were rejected. “I also filed my nomination to challenge Pranab Mukherjee and Ram Nath Kovind in the presidential elections,” Agarwal said.The septuagenarian added that he was not fighting against Arvind Kejriwal, but for Delhi. “I was there when AAP party was launched, but it has failed in its ideals. Everyone has a goal when they arrive on prithvi lok (earth), and my goal is to take on a failing AAP,” Agarwal declared.Overall, 1,029 people filed 1,528 sets of nomination papers in the 70 constituencies, of whom 278, or 27%, were women. At the last available count, 333 papers had been rejected during scrutiny, while three candidates had withdrawn. The lowest number of nominations are in Kasturba Nagar, Patel Nagar and Ambedkar Nagar, where 12 declarations were submitted.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73537405,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-242807,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/52-independents-try-their-luck-for-new-delhi-seat/articleshow/73538106.cms
429,['23/01/2020'],State’s first public-pvt work in water sector begins in Nashik,"This story is from January 23, 2020

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: First work of the water resources department under a public-private partnership has begun in Nashik with the augmentation of Godavari right bank canal, which will reduce water scarcity in various towns, including Shirdi.

The partnership aims at roping in non-profit organisations and individuals ready to spend on building infrastructure without eyeing any benefit. An NGO from Sinnar — Yuva Mitra with the help of Tata Trust — has come forward to start the work.

“The need to augment the carrying capacity of the canal was felt due to urbanization and increased agriculture activity. Under PPP model, the entire project of 110 km is expected to be done in less than Rs 4 crore, which could have otherwise cost the state exchequer at least Rs 30 crore,” Sagar Shinde, executive engineer, Nashik Irrigation Division, said.

Under the project, the government will spend on the fuel costs for the machinery and the operator will be deployed by the NGOs. The augmented canal will provide water to parts of Niphad, Sinnar talukas in Nashik district and Kopargaon, Rahata and Srirampur in Ahmednagar district.

The 110-km Godavari right bank canal was constructed by the British in 1911 at Nandurmadhmeshwar pick-up weir. Then, the capacity of the canal was 384 cubic feet per sec (cusec). It was augmented again in 1963 to 534 cusec. The current work will increase the capacity to 750 cusec. The increase is capacity will also cut down water losses in the transit.

The construction, widening and strengthening of aqueducts that were old and needed repairs was already carried out. Now, the earthen structure has to be augmented. This a major activity and would require the use of earth excavators.

Farmers from Rahata have collected funds for the development of the canal. “We collected Rs 11 lakh and will be giving it to the government,” said Uttam Nirmal, secretary of the farmers association, Rahata, who is former executive engineer of water resources department.

The 90-km long left bank – GLBC was constructed in 1916 to provide water to Vaijapur and other regions in Aurangabad district.

PUNE: A deputy general manager (54) of an automobile company was duped of Rs2.94 lakh after he clicked on the link of a text message, seeking his personal and bank details for processing income tax refund.

The Sinhagad Road resident on Tuesday lodged an FIR with the Dattawadi police, stating that the incident occurred in the early hours of September 9 last year, when he was sleeping. When he woke up and checked the text messages on his cellphone, he found that Rs3.92 lakh had been debited from his bank account through five transactions.

The complainant immediately alerted the bank and requested to block his account. Subsequently, Rs98,000 was credited to his account, said an officer from the Dattawadi police.

The complainant had immediately filed an application to the cyber police station. The probe revealed that the money was transferred to four bank accounts in Pune and Hyderbad. One of the four account holders was a woman. “The case was transferred to the Dattawadi police on Tuesday for further probe,” said an officer from the cyber police station.

The complainant stated in his complaint lodged with the Dattawadi police that since his company had given him a cellphone number for professional use, he had given his personal cellphone to his wife. “His personal cellphone number was connected to his PAN (Personal Account Number). So, his wife received messages from the income tax department,” he said.

On September 3 last year, the complainant’ wife received a text message under the message header QP-ITDEPL, requesting to fill up a form to get income tax refund. “Two days later, the complainants’ wife forwarded him the message to his ‘business’ number. Thinking that the message was important, the complainant clicked on the link and gave his personal information as well as account details,” the officer said.

Four days later, the complainant received five messages on September 9 last year from his bank that Rs3.92 lakh had been debited from his account between 2.30am and 3am. “When the complainant saw the messages, he immediately contacted the bank and blocked his account. It helped him save Rs98,000 as the bank refunded that amount. In all, the complainant lost Rs2.94 lakh to the online fraud,” the officer said.

434,['23/01/2020'],History of golden era of Hindi songs unfolds at ‘Geetyatra’,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Litterateur Ambarish Mishra delivered Mukund Naniwadekar commemorative lecture ‘Geetyatra’, on Wednesday (Pic ... Read More

Nagpur: Many interesting anecdotes about the golden era of Hindi movies hidden in the pages of history, values yesteryear artistes held close to their heart and their magnanimity were beautifully chronicled by writer Ambarish Mishra at a programme held at Press Club, Civil Lines, on Wednesday.

Delivering a lecture ‘ Geetyatra ’, organized in memory of Mukund Naniwadekar, former secretary of Rajaram Library, Mishra traced the musical journey in his lucid style that contained songs and stories behind towering personalities of the film industry.

“Music director Madan Mohan once called Lata Mangeshkar to his place where lyricist Raja Mehdi Ali Khan and producer Raj Khosla were seated. She found on her arrival the room was filled with cigarette smoke. She noticed palpable tension as they were working on a composition which was difficult to come by. The nightingale then requested Madan Mohan to give her the lyrics.

“After some time, Mishra said, Lata sought permission of Madan Mohan whether she could give it a try. A few minutes later, Lata started muttering ‘Tu jahan jahan chalega’. Madan Mohan liked the tune so much that he retained it in the movie “Mera Saaya’. Lata did not claim the right on the composition she made. Such was the sense of belonging the legends had for each other,” Mishra said.

V Shantaram was one of the visionary filmmakers who thought ahead of time and made movies that promoted brotherhood, highlighted glaring discrepancies in society, and great music. After getting independence, the producers were keen to showcase aspirations of a young India instead of depicting a society that bled during the freedom struggle, Mishra said.

It was during this time composers like Naushad, C Ramchandra and Anil Biswas emerged. It was OP Nayyar who spotted talent of Asha Bhosle as a singer, Mishra said.

Very particular about time, Nayyar did not give even a single song to Mohd Rafi for three years as he got delayed for recording, he said.

Sharing lighter moments, Mishra said, producers Yash and BR Chopra pampered lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi to the extent that they even applied oil to his head and pressed legs.

Mishra played a few songs on his mobile in between the lecture and made the audience soak in the magic of music. With ‘Suhani raat dhal chuki’, he explained the mood of each song he played.

Filmmakers, lyricists and musicians of that era took Hindi cinema to greater heights with the mastery they had on the craftsmanship, Mishra said.

Songs like ‘Kuchh aankh mein aasu aate hai, seene main sulagte hain arman, ‘Shola jo bhadke’, ‘Dheere se aaja ri ankhiyan mein nindiya’ and ‘Sar jo tera chakraye’ were a package of good lyrics, music direction and singing, he said.

A short film on Naniwadekar’s life, made by Ajay Rajkarne, was screened.

Mrunalini Naniwadekar conducted the proceedings. Noted playwright Mahesh Elkunchwar, Shripad Joshi and Waman Telang were present.

Representative image

JODHPUR: The Rajasthan High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the divisional commissioner (Jodhpur), district magistrate (Barmer) and other officials seeking a reply on encroachments in Luni river by the land mafia by January 27.

In a PIL, petitioner Sumer Gaur said the land mafia had encroached huge land parcels in Luni river and constructed houses on the plots.

“Not only this, they have also started sand mining in the river, which was detrimental for the water body,” the petition said, alleging that repeated complaints against rampant encroachment to revenue officials of Balotra, district magistrate of Barmer and the divisional commissioner of Jodhpur fell on deaf ears.

Arguing on the petition, advocate Vipul Singhvi said the land in river was a gair-mumkin land, which could not be used for any purpose and any activity of construction or mining was illegal. “But this has been continuing in Luni river since long. The petitioner had submitted representations to the administration and a list of encroachments had been prepared in pursuance of these representations but encroachments continued to thrive,” argued Singhvi. He said the inaction indicated that there was a direct or indirect support to the encroachers by the administration.

“Besides representations, the officials were given many applications and complaints in person, but all these endeavours of the petition failed to bring any results,” he said.

The petitioner also submitted facts and records in support of the petition after which the division bench of justice Sangeet Lodha and justice P S Bhati admitted the petition and issued the notices to the divisional commissioner (Jodhpur), district magistrate (Barmer), SDM (Balotra) and tahsildar and nayab-tahsildar seeking a reply by January 27.

JAIPUR: Recently, chief minister Ashok Gehlot had appealed to women to refrain from wearing ‘ghoonghat’. However, a large number of women turned up at polling stations with ‘ghoonghat’ for the second phase of panchayat elections on Wednesday.

While some believed that this was a “traditional practice” and they would continue to wear it, few others felt that “the practice should go and will be eradicated over a period of time and not overnight.” However, they also said that this was an age-old practice and was adopted to show respect to the elders in the family and was not a ""regressive practice"". “More the women get educated, more would desist from wearing ghoonghat.

“Wearing ‘ghoonghat’ is a 'traditional practice' and it is a way of showing respect to the elders in the family. The women who have been wearing since ages, will not give up ghoonghhat. For them, it would be violation of the age-old tradition. By giving it up, they don't want to disregard the elders in the family. But, the girls of our generation will never wear a ghoonghat,"" said Sumitra Kumari, who is pursuing masters from R L Saharia government college.

Meanwhile, at a polling station in Sargoth panchayat, Govindgarh, among the women clad in ghoonghat in one of the long queues waiting for her turn was Mohri Devi, who believed that the practice can't be eradicated overnight. “It will happen gradually. Women are shy to remove it. But, eventually the practice of wearing ghoonghat will be abolished from the society and it should get eliminated,” she said.

However, a middle-aged woman, Kesar Devi, believed that the practice won't get eradicated. ""I will not remove my ghoonghat. This is an age-old tradition,"" she said.

Following chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s call to eradicate the practice of ‘ghoonghat’, Jaipur district administration had kicked off its ‘Ghoonghat Mukt Jaipur’ campaign in the city.

“It is a good initiative taken by the government. Awareness should be created among women through this drive. It will take time to completely abolish the practice. Can't happen overnight. But, at the same time, this is not a regressive or a bad practice. This has been going on since ages as a part of age-old tradition in our society,"" said Rekha Bohra and Meenakshi Nandwana, who had come to vote at a polling station in Muhana gram panchayat , Sanganer.

HYDERABAD: Stating that authorities should not hold grudges and ego hassles when people try to avail statutory remedies provided by the system, the Telangana high court on Wednesday directed authorities of National Institute of Technology ( NIT ) to ensure that the University’s academic senate committee decides on the appeal filed by a suspended B Tech first year student on January 24 and convey the decision to HC by January 27.

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy gave this direction while hearing the plea of the parents of the student who was suspended by NIT authorities. The student was among 34 students facing disciplinary action for resorting to unlawful activities such as Ganja consumption, ragging etc.

T Mahender Rao , the NIT counsel, handed over a letter written by authorities to the bench,which stated that they respect the high court, but expressed reservations about the student’s decision to approach the court when the appeal filed by him is to be decided by senate committee.

The NIT counsel insisted that the decision making process be left to institute’s discretion. “ Majority of the 34 students who are facing the disciplinary proceedings from rich families. Some of them were using drugs too”, the NIT counsel said.

Appearing for the petitioner, senior counsel D V Sitarama Murthy said that authorities must keep in mind the students’ future before subjecting them to such harsh punishments.

The bench also observed that the tone and tenor of the letter written by NIT authorities reflects an ego hassle.

“The institute has already spoken its mind and it appears that even senate may not be of much help”, the bench said before posting the case to January 27.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has, for the first time, stated that its former judge, R R Jain, was involved in the crime along with police officers including ex-IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt in the alleged drug planting case in Palanpur .

In his order dismissing Bhatt’s request to cancel the order and thereby the investigation and the case itself, Justice Pardiwala said, “The facts of this case need not be repeated. The more they are recalled, it is more painful. Unfortunately, the police officers are involved in this crime along with a former judge of this High Court.”

In this case, the HC had in 2018 ordered an SIT probe into the 1996 drug planting case in which an ‘A’ summary was filed by police by exonerating Rajasthan-based lawyer, Sumersingh Rajpurohit. The investigation as well as a complaint filed by Rajpurohit in Rajasthan had revealed that Bhatt and his subordinate officers had allegedly planted opium at Hotel Lilawati in Palanpur to frame the lawyer, in order to get him to vacate a shop in Pali town. The shop belonged to the sister of former Gujarat HC judge R R Jain, who had allegedly requested Bhatt to resolve the issue of the possession of the shop.

The HC said that the request to recall the order was one more attempt by Bhatt to create unnecessary hindrances and obstructions in the conduct of the trial proceedings of the NDPS case in Palanpur court, which has already framed charges. “I have no hesitation in observing that the filing of applications of the present type is nothing but last ditch efforts on the part of the applicant to see that the trial does not proceed further. Such attempts needs to be condemned in strong words,” the court said.

The court finally warned Bhatt saying that it would take “stern action” against him, if he continues to resort to delaying tactics.

442,['23/01/2020'],Agra: District administration to launch campaign against ‘jugaad’ vehicles,"AGRA: The district administration, taking cognizance of a TOI report which appeared on Wednesday, has decided to launch campaign against the unauthorised ‘jugaad’ vehicles operating in the city. The transport department and traffic police will have to ensure that the pollution causing jugaad vehicles do not operate in the eco-sensitive Taj Trapezium Zone. In Agra, additional district magistrate (city) will monitor the campaign.Deputy transport commissioner (Agra Zone) JS Kushwaha stated that orders will be issued to all the regional transport officers to ensure jugaad vehicles do not operate. In this regard, action taken will be monitored on a monthly basis.The term jugaad refers to an innovative fix or a simple work-around, a quick solution that bends rules or resource that can be used in such a way. There are at least 10,000 jugaad vehicles operating in the city, according to estimate.Jugaad vehicles are basically old, modified two-wheelers, tempos or rickshaws fitted with motor engine. These are extensively used for ferrying goods. Besides being a threat to road safety, the jugaad vehicles are causing pollution in the eco-sensitive Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ).Talking to TOI on Wednesday, additional district magistrate (city) Prabhakant Awasthi said, “Jugaad vehicles are illegal and will not be allowed to operate. Soon, a campaign will be launched to seize all these vehicles. Manufacturers of such vehicles will also be identified. Strict action will be taken against them.”Regional transport officer (administration) Ashok Kumar Singh said, “It is illegal to modify old vehicles and use them for loading purposes as jugaad. All such vehicles will be seized and dismantled. Besides, action will be taken against the owners of these vehicles.”While the jugaad vehicles may be cost effective for users, they are not good for road use. They cause accidents and are known to have poor brake mechanism.Since jugaad do not conform to specifications of a motor vehicle, they are not covered under the Motor Vehicles Act. Therefore, RTOs do not have any record of the actual number of jugaad on the roads. These vehicles, hence, do not have any vehicles registration plate. As a result, owners do not pay any road tax.Also, they do not have to undergo any pollution test and follow anti-pollution norms, mandatory for vehicles. That is why it is essential to ban them from plying in the Taj Trapezium Zone to protect over 40 monuments, including Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri.According to sources, an old scooter can be turned into a jugaad by spending as little as Rs 10,000. A jugaad auto-rickshaw can be developed for Rs 20,000. With minimum requirement of maintenance, jugaad vehicles can easily operate for three to five years.",agra,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73541177,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-138450,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/district-admin-to-launch-campaign-against-jugaad-vehicles/articleshow/73529135.cms

Nagpur: In the run-up to the forthcoming budget, the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) has demanded that banks should be mandated to extend farm credit only against e-negotiable warehouse receipts (e-NWR). There has to be a strong credit guarantee structure that would further enhance the banks’ confidence to boost farm lending.

The Commodity Transaction Tax (CTT) levied on processed commodities has increased the impact cost of market participants. The Indian commodity market has immense potential as many of these commodities can set Indian prices as a benchmark for the global market. Hence, the government should have a relook at CTT, said a NCDEX press release over budget expectations.

While SEBI has opened the gates for the commodity markets by allowing mutual fund, indices and options participation, the government should reframe its regulatory policies and start taking positions on the exchange platforms for procurements or sales, moots NCDEX for the budget.

It has also called for implementation of modified and stringent borrowing policy by RBI which could reduce NPAs. This would be possible if borrowers are obligated to decide minimum hedged positions and disclose their hedge positions, says NCDEX.

If these propositions are implemented in the right direction, we are hopeful that it will help commodity markets to grow in a vibrant ecosystem, inducing positive sentiments among our entire value chain and participants.

Saranya Sasi

KOCHI: “I will be joining the eight of you for the Thiruvananthapuram trip tomorrow,” said Saranya Sasi ’s teacher at Amrita School of Pharmacy in Kochi on Wednesday afternoon while discussing the plan to visit Saranya’s funeral during their class. “Madam, there are only seven of us now,” said a friend, unable to hold back his tears. Saranya’s friends and teachers, who are in a state of shock, are yet to accept the fact that she is dead.

For classmates and some faculty members, Saranya was their ‘chechi’ as she was pursuing her second-year in MPharm course, nine years after completing her BPharm from Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College in 2009. She was the eldest one in her class and some of the faculty members were her juniors during their college days.

For her teachers, she was one of the most hardworking and determined students they had trained. Despite being out of touch with pharmacy science for nine years after her marriage, the 33-year-old mother of three became the topper in the first year of the course for which she won a gold medal.

“Usually, most people would hesitate to pursue postgraduation in pharmacy science after such a long gap, but Saranya was determined to fulfill her dream. She was my junior in college and one of the most-active students I knew. She was an allrounder with good leadership and presentation skills. Last week, she received much praise from us after her third-semester mid-thesis presentation. We are yet to accept that she left us, just like that...,” said Dr Aneesh TP, a faculty at Amrita.

Saranya had applied for a week’s leave in advance for the Nepal trip. “After that she told us her husband had come home (from abroad) and the family was planning to visit Nepal. I granted her the leave and she was supposed to join us on Friday. Besides being a brilliant student, she was a mentor and elder sister for her classmates. Being the only day-scholar, she used to bring homely food for them. Students are still in a state of shock,” said Sreeja C Nair, Saranya’s project guide.

“I was her junior during the BPharm course and chechi was a mentor for us since college days. Though I was her faculty at Amrita, she was still the same old sister. She was a role-model for all those women who dream of pursuing higher studies after marriage,” said Prashant Sadanandan, another MPharm faculty at Amrita.

Faculty members and students will visit her home once the bodies are brough to Thiruvananthapuram. The teachers of Saraswati Vidayaniketan School, where Saranya’s three children studied, will also pay homage. The school observed a holiday on Wednesday.

Interiors of the e-waste information and collection vehicle

Bhopal: Electronic waste collection and disposal is set to get makeover, with introduction of e-waste information and collection vehicle by the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC). The vehicle is expected to be taken up as a model project by central pollution control board.

“Currently, electronic waste is being dumped in unscientific manner. Besides sensitising people over proper disposal of e-waste, the collected waste would be sent to Alwar in Rajasthan for scientific disposal,” said MP state level waste management committee, member, Imtiyaz Ali.

E-waste is often mixed with local garbage like other solid/semi-solid waste. “Only 1.5% of e-waste generated in India gets recycled. Consider the number of mobile phone and other tech, the need for proper disposal of e-waste is an urgent need. We expect to recycle or scientifically dispose in Bhopal e-waste,” said Ali. The civic body is aiming to make the city the first state capital to attain 100% scientific disposal of e-waste. Bhopal produces upwards of 250MT of e-waste each year. It includes extremely toxic and harmful materials such as lead, cadmium and brominated flame retardants.

Last year, BMC stepped up its campaign for improving cleanliness and hygiene in the state capital.

“It is important to separate e-waste from daily domestic waste. There are serious health and environmental impacts in case of improper disposal of e-waste,” said BMC additional commissioner Rajesh Rathore.

IIT-Bombay, director Subhasis Chaudhuri (File Photo)

MUMBAI: In an open house organised by the student body at IIT-Bombay , director Subhasis Chaudhuri said the institute must be free of any kind of political endorsement and students could express their “individual” views on political issues outside the campus. These opinions should be made in their individual capacity and not be attributed to the institute.

The open house was organised by students’ representatives on the campus to discuss issues related to the students. While responding to a question on the ongoing protests on the campus, the director is said to have told the students that the institute was funded by the Government of India and was an institute of eminence and its primary mandate was to produce high-quality manpower and do research that benefitted people at large.

The director also said just as a section of students had a right to express their opinion, others also had the right to not get disturbed.

During the session, Chaudhuri is said to have reiterated that the institute was strictly apolitical and that it did not endorse any views on politics. He added it needed to be completely free of any kind of political endorsement. “While expressing your views, you cannot say that it is from IIT-Bombay or you are representing IIT-Bombay. No one can say that IIT-Bombay is for or against any political views,” said a student, quoting the director.

TOI tried to contact the director, but he remained unavailable for comment.

Chaudhuri said the students were free to assert their opinion outside the campus or even write about it, adding that “at the end of the day, the pen is mightier than the sword”.

On Tuesday, the students of IIT-Bombay received a mail from the general secretary of the students’ council, which said, “In light of the various activities that have been happening in the institute recently, the general secretaries have requested the director to be part of an open house meeting on Wednesday.”

Sources said Chaudhuri reminded the students that the classrooms, the hostels and everything on the campus was funded by the Government of India and it was the taxpayers’ money. He told them it was the students’ responsibility to maintain the reputation of the institute, which was one of the best in the country. He then added there could be difference of opinion on the campus and students should understand each other’s viewpoints.

459,['23/01/2020'],Can’t convert playgrounds to gardens: HC,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Nagpur: Ruling that playgrounds cannot be converted into gardens, the district court has stayed Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) plan to develop a garden in one of the open spaces in Kukde Layout in South Nagpur. The move is likely to save playgrounds across the city.

Hearing a petition filed by Ajay Chaudhary, a resident of Kukde Layout, joint civil judge PP Naigaonkar passed an order on March 8, 2019, saying, “The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court in PIL No. 40/2013 by order dated September 12, 2017 has specifically stated that playgrounds are not to be allotted to any private or public institution(s). Playgrounds should be meant only for children, without any kind of hindrance or obstacle.

According to the orders mentioned in the PIL, defendant No. 2 (civic chief) and defendant No. 3 (garden superintendent) cannot convert land meant for playgrounds.

The plaintiff prime facie established the fact that the defendants are acting contrary to the rules and have undertaken the work of converting a playground into a garden.

Defendants No. 2 and 3 or anybody else have been restrained through a temporary injunction from carrying out any work which leads to conversion of a playground into a garden or any other work till the final disposal of the suit, said the order .

As per the details in the petition as well as the order, the NMC’s garden department had proposed to develop a garden and a green gym on the open space (No. 392) in Kukde Layout. The civic body had sanctioned Rs29.77 lakh and even issued a work order to a private contractor for execution of the project in March 2018.

When the NMC’s engineers and contractor arrived at the site to begin work on the project, local residents, including Chaudhary, opposed the move and lodged a complaint with the civic body. Later, Chaudhary filed a petition in the district court, pleading conservation of playgrounds for sports activities.

The district court’s order has come as a shot in the arm for those in favour of playgrounds. Naresh Pandey, a resident of the same layout, lodged a complaint with the NMC. Citing the court order, Pandey demanded that work on the garden, walking track and the green gym on open space No. 225 which is on the adjacent playground should be not begin.

“It’s a contempt of the court order by the NMC. It could not convert playground No. 392 into a garden. It also failed to install a green gym due to the court’s order. Therefore, NMC started work on playground No. 225. After we opposed the move, the NMC assured us that the playground would not be converted into a garden. Despite the assurances, the NMC went ahead and installed a green gym and started the construction of the walking track on the playground. NMC norms say that construction on only 15% of playground is permissible and that too related to sports only. Over here, construction has crossed the 15% mark,” Pandey said.

He added that NMC engineers threatened to cut trees on the playground for construction activities. “Many pipes (big in size) were also dumped on the playground. Children can no longer play and neither can senior citizens take their walks,” he said.

Engineers from the NMC’s garden department told TOI that the plan to develop the garden has been dropped. “The green gym and the walking track are meant for fitness and activities related to sports. The pipes will be removed soon. We also dropped the plan to lay a storm water drain along the walking track in the playground,” they said.

One of the biggest layouts of South Nagpur, Kukde Layout is running out of playgrounds. The Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) had developed a garden on the sprawling playground of the layout. The remaining playgrounds have green gyms and religious structures. In one playground, two library buildings have been constructed adjacently.

For decades, the NMC has been converting playgrounds into gardens. It has even permitted construction of religious structures and community halls. In Dhantoli, the NMC and the NIT are using land reserved for playgrounds for parking of city buses, slums and commercial shops. It has started the process to convert the city’s biggest playground into a commercial zone.

Kolkata: The prolonged and chilly winter has hot up some segments of brown goods sector in the country, especially in the east. The room heater business has witnessed the biggest surge in demand in the last 10 years or so in West Bengal and eastern region while there has been a multi-fold growth across India. Once an unorganised market, the room heater business in India is now ruled by four major organised players — Bajaj Electricals, Orient Electric, Havells India and Usha.

An official of Bajaj Electricals said that in most of the states, the company is experiencing a heavy demand. “There is no stock in most of the eastern states because nobody has anticipated so huge demand,” he added.

According to him, there has been more than 100% growth nationally in the segment. North and east India taken together comprise 80% of the room heater market.

Salil Kappoor, business head (home appliances), Orient Electric, pointed out that there has been a 150% growth in oil-based room heater in India. “In December, there has been a 70% growth in West Bengal, which this year has become a major market. Now there is supply bottleneck in most of the markets,” he added.

According to him, the size of the room heater market in India is Rs 400 crore, while in West Bengal it is worth Rs 30 crore.

Havells has seen growth from not just consumers, but several corporate sectors as well. Rajiv Kenue, senior vice president, Havells India, said, “We are one of the top players in oil-filled radiator and room heaters in India. With sharp a dip in temperature and intense cold waves spreading through North India, we have seen a surge in consumer demand compared to the last year. Delhi-NCR is one of the top-three regions driving demand for oil-filled radiators and room heaters. Most of our stocks of heaters and OFR in retail stores and Havells outlets are on the verge of being sold out. Consumer sentiments have picked up with regard to these purchases.”

Pulkit Baid, director of Great Eastern Retail, one of the leading electronics retailers in east, pointed out that there has been an unprecedented demand for room heaters this year. “What we sell in four months, this year we sold in one month only. This is a record in 15 years,” he added. Baid also admitted that most of the retailers are running out of stock.

Union Information and Broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday said questions pertaining to date and place of birth of parents in the National Population Register ( NPR ) could remain while furnishing such details — as made clear previously — will be optional.

Responding to questions at a briefing on Cabinet decisions on Wednesday, he said if a person doesn’t share details the questions will be “considered as dropped”. His remarks came a day after consumer affairs minister Ramvilas Paswan said that the query would be dropped from NPR.

Responding to a specific question, Javadekar said, “No no...It’s not like that. It will be considered as dropped if someone doesn’t remember the date and place of birth of his/her father and mother and can’t share.”

The questions on date and place of birth of parents had triggered fears that the exercise might be a precursor to the preparation of National Register of Citizens (NRC). Paswan told TOI on Wednesday, “There should be no need to show any document so far as the date of birth of the person or his/ her parents are concerned and I feel these won’t be required when information will be collected. Information provided by people must be trusted and you can check them by talking to their neighbours.”

Talking to reporters on Monday, Paswan had said even he didn’t know the date of birth of his parents. “Do I cease to become a citizen on that account? I had told the home ministry that these things will cause confusion,” he had said.

The minister also said the question on citizenship of a person born in India cannot be raised due to lack of such documentary evidence. “How can anyone’s citizenship be snatched on this ground? The government has reiterated this on several occasions,” Paswan said.

BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra (ANI Photo)

NEW DELHI: Accusing Congress of playing politics of religion and Muslim appeasement , BJP on Wednesday said the opposition party should be renamed ‘Muslim League Congress’.

Addressing a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra slammed Congress after Ashok Chavan said his party formed an alliance with Shiv Sena on the insistence of Muslims.

Patra said it was nothing but appeasement. “Two days ago, Ashok Chavan said ‘we formed the government in Maharashtra with Shiv Sena on the appeal of our Muslim brothers. Muslims were saying that BJP is their prime enemy’. This is an appeasing statement from the former CM,” Patra said.

“Does this mean Congress forms government asking Muslims and Muslims only? Do they not care about Hindus or other communities? Congress party should be renamed from Indian National Congress to MLC — Muslim League Congress. They only talk about Muslims and try to polarise them,” he added.

Patra claimed Congress did “Muslim appeasement” for votes but never did any good for the community.

He referred to comments of several opposition leaders, including those from NCP and AIMIM, to allege that they were “abusing” Hindus in the name of anti-CAA protests and sought an apology from Congress president Sonia Gandhi and NCP’s Sharad Pawar.

Asked about Congress functionary Mallikarjun Kharge’s jibe at RSS for its “non-participation” in the freedom movement, Patra asked if parents of Sonia Gandhi, who is of Italian origin, had fought in India’s independence struggle.

Highlighting a report in an Urdu daily, Patra said Rahul Gandhi had once described Congress as a “party of Muslims” and its functionaries had coined terms like “saffron terror”.

Patra claimed a video of Shaheen Bagh protests purportedly showed children talking about “murdering” the Prime Minister and the home minister and asked who had spread such “poison”. “It is a tragedy that poison against Hindus is being sowed in the country,” he said.

465,['23/01/2020'],Security at commercial complexes in twin cities under police scanner,"This story is from January 23, 2020

Hubballi: In the recent past, commercial complexes have mushroomed across Hubballi, and these establishments are collectively the most significant testament to the city’s growing tryst with progress. Now, in the wake of a crude bomb being found and subsequently defused in Mangaluru, the spotlight has turned on these complexes, but for an entirely different reason: Hubballi-Dharwad police are subjecting the security arrangement at these establishments under a lens.

The growth of Hubballi, coupled with its bright prospects, has drawn many investors to the city, with real estate developers showing a keen interest in initiating development projects. Many developers are eager to build commercial complexes in Hubballi-Dharwad, which together have 2,500 commercial complexes between them. However, the profusion of such establishments in the twin cities has cut out the work in front of the cops.

Hubballi-Dharwad police commissioner R Dileep was quick to point out that securing the safety of citizens was a continuous process. “But the incident in Mangaluru has necessitated the need to review security in crowded places in the twin cities. We will have to keep a close watch on anti-social elements,” Dileep told TOI.

The commissioner lamented the failure of many commercial establishments in the twin cities to comply with the guidelines laid down by law enforcement agencies. “In most complexes, there is no sign of a closed circuit television (CCTV) camera. This poses a huge problem when police initiate a probe. It also makes it difficult for us to monitor the movement of those people listed on our records as anti-social elements,” said Dileep.

He said that, owners of commercial establishments had been directed to install CCTV cameras in the building. “We had not set them a deadline, but we are trying to motivate them now to install these cameras at the earliest. We will be paying a visit to these establishments again to see if the owners have complied with the rules. If we find that they have still not installed CCTV cameras, we will be compelled to set a deadline,” the commissioner added.

Dileep admitted that police did not have in their possession knowledge about the exact number of commercial complexes in the twin cities. “We will seek these details from the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC). We will hold a meeting with HDMC officials to review security measures in the twin cities, which will be followed by another one with the owners of commercial complexes,” said Dileep.

A Hubballi-Dharwad police official rued the fact that a mere five to 10% of the commercial establishments in the twin cities had installed CCTV cameras on their premises. “In some cases, the cameras that the complexes have are defunct, while there is no facility to store old footage in some among other problems. Such being the case, all owners have been directed to install quality cameras on their premises,” said the cop.

Hubballi: Lack of adequate libraries and an equal lack of books in existing ones often stunt the growth of students , and in government schools, this rings truer. However, access to internet in many state-run institutions is looking to offset this limitation.

“Google is my best friend,” gushed Jyoti Bennur, a class VIII student at the Government Higher Primary School in Ballarwad village in Navalgund taluk. Jyoti has a tablet and is well-acquainted with all the apps on the device. “I get all the answers I need, and additional information along with it using the tablet,” said Jyoti in fluent English , who also shared her aptitude in the use of Email. The tablet helps her stay abreast of current affairs.

Jyoti is one of the many beneficiaries of an initiative, ‘Skill-in-Village’ undertaken by the Deshpande Foundation to enhance skills of schoolchildren in Dharwad, Haveri and Gadag districts. The programme envisages equipping students in rural areas with all the skills their urban counterparts are presently being trained in, in addition to which efforts are being made to turn them into effective, and more importantly, confident speakers.

Manager for the ‘Skill-in-Village’ project Harish MH said that improving communication skills of rural students was one of the primary objectives of the initiative. “Improving their English was the key to building their confidence. Our project also focuses on improving skills in computer and overall digital literacy. We have been working in 42 villages since the launch of the initiative in 2017. Some of the villages we have worked in are Karadigudda, Honnapur, Chabbi, Abbigeri and Bannikoppa. The initiative has yielded desired results with many students in these villages now seeming at ease in English, and very comfortable with operating tablets and computers,” said Harish.

The foundation has roped in 42 teachers, who are deployed to rural schools in the three districts, where they first conduct a survey, following which confer with the elders in the village and parents, before hitting the ground. “We roll out the initiative in those villages where we are guaranteed of maximum support from the local governing bodies such as the gram panchayat,” added Harish.

One of the teachers working in the villages is Laxmi Bhovivaddar, presently working with students of a government school in Ballarwad. “We focus on teaching the kids English grammar and other communication techniques. We train them in essential skills such as introducing themselves, deliberating on subjects among others. We also teach them how to use computers, using Google , etc,” she said.

Manjunath Baligar, another teacher working with the Deshpande Foundation on the project, said that the children were being taught other skills that help them in life before and after school. “We hold a workshop each month wherein students are called on to make a presentation to help us assess their skills. We also teach them lessons from their syllabus,” said Baligar.

Belagavi: Prison reforms, more often than not, aim not merely at improving conditions within the walls but also to markedly enhance their prospects for a life beyond, so as to complete the process of their transformation. In keeping with this vision, inmates of the Hindalga Central Prison in Belagavi are, besides equipping themselves with a useful skill that is bound to come handy in their life once out of prison, are performing a service for society while at it. For the past four years, inmates of Hindalga Central Prison have been stitching uniforms for schools.

Working at the garment factory within the premises of the prison, the inmates have been stitching, on average, 1,000 clothes for students. What started off as an exercise to equip the inmates with vocational skills turned into an endeavour that could be utilised for the benefit of others as well. Over the years, the prison authorities have purchased more advanced tailoring machines, and have roped in the department of textiles for their project. The garment factory inside the prison has only grown bigger, the scope of the project expanding with it.

Chief superintendent of police (prisons) Krishna Kumar did not conceal his delight with the industry of the inmates of Hindalga. “In the past four years, the inmates have stitched more than 3,000 clothes, which is an astounding achievement. What is more, some of them have grown into really skilled tailors. More than 60 inmates are working at the tailoring centre in the jail, with 37 advanced tailoring machines,” Kumar told TOI.

The senior official said that clothes stitched by the inmates were being sold to a wholesale shop in Belagavi, contracted by many schools in the district for uniforms. “This was a business deal that was negotiated by the skill development arm of the department of textiles,” said Kumar.

He said that demand for uniforms peaked during April, May and June, although the prison received orders for other clothes for the reminder of the year. “The inmates stitch skirts, leggings, knickers, trousers and shirts. They feel proud to contribute their bit for nation-building,” Kumar added.

Uniforms for home guards

Hindalga Central Prison has recently been tasked with stitching pants for home guards. The home department has placed the order with the prison authorities, seeking 3,000 pants. The inmates have previously stitched pants for home guards, although they were only for those in Belagavi.

LUCKNOW/HYDERABAD: A day after Union home minister Amit Shah dared the Opposition for a debate on the amended citizenship law (CAA), BSP chief Mayawati and AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday accepted the challenge. Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav, however, threw down the gauntlet to BJP for a debate on ‘development’.

Addressing a rally in Lucknow on Tuesday, Shah had challenged Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee and Akhilesh Yadav to debate CAA with him.

Putting out a tweet, Mayawati said: “BSP accepts Centre’s challenge to debate the controversial CAA/NRC/NPC, against which there have been protests across the country, especially by women and youth. The debate can take place on any platform and anywhere.”

On his part, Owaisi said: “People from the media informed me that the Union home minister is ready to debate CAA with Rahul Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee. I told them I am there, right? Let him debate with the dariwala (bearded man) first.”

Talking to reporters in Hyderabad on Wednesday, he said, “Call Asaduddin Owaisi and Union home minister, and let’s debate. Let’s debate everything, including CAA, NPR (National Population Register) and NRC (National Register of Citizens).”

Akhilesh, however, did not mention CAA while challenging BJP for a debate. “Let them determine the place and platform, we are ready.

4.5 lakh commuters use Metro every day

MUMBAI: Starting today , commuters of Metro One can enjoy unlimited travel by upgrading their monthly 45-trip passes for an additional Rs 25. The monthly passes cost Rs 1,375 for a journey between Versova-Andheri, while the new scheme offers commuters unlimited travel across the entire network for Rs 1,400.The scheme is expected to benefit commuters who have to make multiple trips that involve breaking their journey.The popular 45-trip monthly pass will, however, continue to be available.In the popular 45-trip scheme, commuters can make 45 trips, but are charged for only 30 trips. About 50,000 commuters make one lakh trips on a weekday using this pass.In 2019, Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL) on an average carried 4.5 lakh commuters per day on weekdays in more than 400 services.Metros in India and abroad offer two ticketing products – token for single journey travel and a card.Looking at the needs of Mumbaikars, Mumbai Metro One had introduced two additional travel products –return journey token and trip pass. All four products are currently available in physical form (Paper QR, token or cards) and also through smart phone apps (mobile QR Ticket).A week ago, MMOPL had announced QR-coded tickets as a replacement to the plastic token system.An MMOPL official said, “We will launch a new product in the form of monthly pass from January 23, which will allow commuters to take unlimited rides during the validity period of the pass. The pass will not be transferable.”The product will initially be launched for six months and extended based on commuter feedback.An MMOPL spokesperson said, “We are confident commuters will find immense benefit in this product and travel without having to think about the number of trips.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73535906,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-227063,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-unlimited-ride-metro-passes-from-today/articleshow/73535748.cms

TimesView The rise in incidence of crime in the Tricity can only be combated through greater coordination among the police forces of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula. The criminals have always taken advantage of the twin facts of contiguous boundaries and jurisdiction barriers to make a quick getaway. The Tricity police departments had created WhatsApp groups to share information on crime in their area about over a year ago following the Punjab governor’s suggestion for fighting crime jointly. The proposed coordination meetings of DGPs will further boost and streamline the enforcement agencies' joint fight to keep criminals at bay in the Tricity.

UT call on first flyover: Punjab, Haryana

CHANDIGARH: The DGPs of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh will meet once every three months and the Tricity SPs once a month to tackle inter-state criminals involved in heinous crimes and snatchings and to improve law and order.The decision was taken in the second meeting of the Coordination Committee of the Tricity on Wednesday held under the chairmanship of Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator V P Singh Badnore.At the outset of the meeting, Badnore thanked everyone for their active participation in the meeting, the main objective of which is to work for the coordinated development of Chandigarh and the satellite cities in Punjab and Haryana.The meeting discussed law and order issues like the participation of both the neighbouring states in tackling crime, snatchings and thefts.UT DGP Sanjay Baniwal suggested the use of emergency response support system (control room no.112) and e-beat book extension in the Tricity. It was also decided that field officers would meet more frequently for better coordination and cooperation.Concerned about multiple shootings by inter-state gangs — some in broad daylight in the past year — the administration had proposed the formation of a special unit of Tricity police. According to the proposal, the special unit would comprise superintendent of police (SP)-level officials from Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh to specifically coordinate in gang-related crimes.On UT administration seeking Punjab and Haryana response on the construction of the proposed flyover and underpass at the Sector 29-31-Industrial Area roundabout, both the states said it is for the UT administration to decide, and they have nothing to do with the matter. UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida, reportedly, brought the Sector 29 flyover and underpass for discussion in the Coordination Committee meeting. Punjab representatives maintained it for the administration to decide on to how to solve the problem of traffic congestion at the roundabout.Haryana representative too maintained it is the responsibility of the UT to resolve the traffic issues as it deems fit. But a senior Haryana official said the administration should explore other alternatives like removing the rotary at the intersection and installing traffic lights, as was done at the Sector 9-8-17-18 intersection.A proposal to impose uniform speed limits on major roads connecting Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali was also tabled in the meeting. But it was decided that the UT adviser Manoj Parida will hold a separate meeting with officials to resolve the issue. In the next meeting, Punjab will be asked to resolve the traffic congestion due to traffic signal installation at Chandigarh-Zirakpur barrier opposite Makkar farmhouse.The issue of beggary was also highlighted, with UT DGP stressing on working together for tackling the issue.It was also proposed that the security audit of public places for women safety should be done on various safety parameters like lighting, openness, visibility, security, public transport and setting up of powerline for women and child safety and to adopt the best practices on same lines from other states, including Uttar Pradesh.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73535742,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-716130,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tricity-joins-hands-to-improve-law-and-order/articleshow/73535739.cms

Don’t accept Punjab 100m ESZ plan: UT

CHANDIGARH: The 100-metre radius of eco sensitive zone (ESZ) around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary is not acceptable to Chandigarh and is a major threat to Sukhna Lake and the sanctuary. This was submitted by the UT administration in the meeting of the Coordination Committee of Tricity on Wednesday.UT chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai made these submissions in the meeting chaired by Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator V P Singh Badnore and attended by UT adviser Manoj Parida, Haryana chief secretary Keshni Anand, Punjab chief secretary Karan Avtar and other senior officials.Though final notification for Punjab and Haryana will be issued by the central government, the 100m proposal of Punjab is not acceptable to the administration, Dalai told TOI. The administration has already written a letter to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change in this regard, he said.In the recent letter to the director general of forests and special secretary, the UT had opposed the Punjab government's plan.The administration had termed Punjab's 2013 proposal to declare only 100-metre of state's area around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary as an ESZ a threat. Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had recently backed the state government's proposal.The administration has already notified 2 to 2.75km radius around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary as an ESZ. The environment ministry had also issued a final notification on ESZ around the sanctuary for Chandigarh, but Punjab and Haryana have so far not declared these zones in their jurisdictions.The UT is pushing for Punjab and Haryana to leave a matching area from the lake boundary as restricted development zone. UT, in a letter written on January 14, stated, “The ESZ for the area falling in Chandigarh around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary has already been notified by the ministry on January 18, 2017, wherein ESZ has been kept 2 to 2.75 km and regulating/prohibiting various activities therein. However, the proposal of Punjab is not in line with the proposal of Chandigarh… Further, it is to reiterate that similar proposal of the Punjab government, which was sent to the government in 2015, was not accepted by the Centre. In 2018, the government once again turned down the proposal of Punjab government proposing only 100m width as ESZ from Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. In case only 100m is left as ESZ, it will have serious adverse impact on Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary as well as Sukhna Lake (sic).”The UT has requested the ministry not to accept Punjab’s proposal in the interest of wildlife conservation in the sanctuary as well as for Sukhna Lake, which is being declared as a wetland, draft notification for which has already been issued by the administration.Earlier on December 27 last, the Punjab CM wrote to the Union minister of environment, forest and climate change Prakash Javadekar, “In the light of recommendations made by the Punjab government, the ministry has already notified ESZ of 100m width around all the wildlife sanctuaries of Punjab. However, the proposal of Punjab government in respect of declaring 100m ESZ around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary has not been agreed upon by the ministry on the basis that Chandigarh had proposed ESZ of 2 to 2.75km, and therefore the ministry advised Punjab to explore the possibility of declaring 1km ESZ instead of the proposed ESZ of 100m.The Punjab government reconsidered its decision of declaring 100m ESZ and it was found that the decision taken by the government on August 8, 2013, was in line with the recommendation of the central-empowered committee of the Supreme Court.”",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73535910,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-397093,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/100m-esz-plan-not-on-administration-tells-punjab-haryana/articleshow/73535762.cms

AMRITSAR: Pakistani Sikh politician Radesh Singh Tony, who had contested the 2018 general polls as an Independent candidate but lost, has fled the country along with his wife and three sons due to threats from fundamentalists .

The move comes barely a year after Tony, chairman of the Khalsa Peace and Justice Foundation , fled to Lahore in November 2018 from his native city of Peshawar , leaving behind his business and property. Tony told TOI on Wednesday that minority communities in Pakistan, including Sikhs, Hindus and Christians, were living under constant threats from fundamentalists who he claimed enjoyed the Pakistan government's sup port.

After the gunning down of Peshawar's prominent Sikh leader Charanjit Singh in May 2018, a large number of Sikhs and Hindus had migrated from Peshawar to safer places in Pakistan with sizeable populations of their communities.

NEW DELHI: Ghana has sought to take a leaf out of the Narendra Modi government's 'Ujjwala' scheme for giving poor households access to clean cooking fuel at affordable rates and sought India's assistance for building systems and infrastructure to promote LPG as household, industrial and commercial fuel in that country.

IndianOil and National Petroleum Authority of Ghana on Wednesday exchanged an MoU in the presence of oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Ghana high commissioner Michael Aaron here. The MoU paves the way for IndianOil to help Ghana implement its National LPG Promotion Policy. The MoU also allows IndianOil the option to open a business in Ghana's downstream sector.

Ghana is the second country to have sought India's expertise in giving citizens access to clean fuel. In March 2017, Nepal sought IndianOil's expertise for rolling out LPG-for-poor schemes similar to the Ujjwala programme envisaging giving poor households LPG connections free of cost.

GUWAHATI: The Gauhati high court on Thursday directed the government to maintain status quo regarding the security cover of former Assam CM Tarun Gogoi .

Gogoi, a three-time Congress CM, had approached the HC after his security cover was downgraded to ""Z"" with CRPF cover from ""Z plus"" recently. The hearing was done in the court of Justice Prashanta Kumar Deka.

Advocate Atul Chandra Buragohain, appearing for Gogoi in court, said, ""The court has asked the government to maintain status quo. The next hearing of the case is on February 12. During the period, the court has asked the government to file an affidavit.""

This is the second time that Gogoi's security cover has been downgraded by the government. In 2016, after the defeat of Congress in the assembly election, Gogoi's security cover was scaled down from ""Z Plus"" security cover with NSG to ""Z plus"" with CRPF cover.

GUWAHATI: Anti-CAA petitioners in Assam and Tripura on Wednesday gave a thumbs up to the Supreme Court ’s decision to treat their reservations about the new law as distinct from that of the rest of the country and, therefore, hear those cases separately and on priority.

“We have been asking for separate hearings for Assam and the northeast as our issues are entirely different,” Lurinjyoti Gogoi, the general secretary of the All Assam Students Union (Aasu), said. “We have been the worst victims of illegal migration from Bangladesh and cannot afford to take in a single extra illegal migrant — be it a Hindu or Muslim. We believe the Supreme Court will give us justice.” In its petition, Aasu has questioned the logic of considering illegal migrants eligible for citizenship even if they entered the state after the Assam Accord cut-off of March 25, 1971.

Congress’s Pradyot Deb Barman, a scion of the Tripura royal family and one of the petitioners against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, said he felt reassured by the apex court taking cognisance of the fact that the issues raised by anti-CAA campaigners in his state and neighbouring Assam were not the same as those echoing elsewhere.

478,['23/01/2020'],"70L infiltrators in Bengal, most vote for TMC: Ghosh","This story is from January 23, 2020

Falakata (Alipurduar): Th-ere are 70 lakh Bangladeshi infiltrators in Bengal, a majority of whom are Trinamool Congress voters, BJP president Dilip Ghosh claimed at a pro-CAA rally in Alipurduar’s Falakata on Wednesday, providing a glimpse of the political calculation behind the battle over the new citizenship law in the state.

Citing the 2019 Lok Sabha poll figures, Ghosh claimed Trinamool got 2.5 crore votes in Bengal while BJP finished the race with 2.3 crore. What he left unsaid was that CAA would come in handy to remove names of “infiltrators” from the voters’ list and bridge the gap between his party and Trinamool before the 2021 assembly polls.

“As many as 70 lakh Bangladeshi infiltrators are living in Bengal, of whom 50 lakh are Trinamool voters. These people are taking away a large chunk of the subsidised ration meant for bona fide residents. They are claiming a portion of your PM Awas Yojana allotments for dwelling units and also 100-day work. How long will you allow this when there no jobs in this state?” Ghosh said.

Referring to the arson at railway stations in Bengal after the passage of the citizenship bill in Parliament, he said: “Can a citizen damage public property or lay siege to railway stations? They (the arsonists) are all Bangladeshi infiltrators for whom the Trinamool chief, Congress and CPM have taken to the streets. Their brethren in Bangladesh poured poison in your ponds there, misbehaved with your wife and daughter, and forced you to leave the country and settle here.”

Ghosh also claimed that the Trinamool chief was “desperately walking the streets” because she can read the writing on the wall once the infiltrators are removed from the voters’ list.
