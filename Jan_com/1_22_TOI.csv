3,['22/01/2020'],Mohan Raja and I spent two days with Sriram Raghavan to discuss Andhadhun: Thiagarajan,"The Tamil remake of the Hindi film Andhadhun, which stars Prashanth in the lead, has a director on board! The film will be helmed by Mohan Raja , and the filmmaker has already completed the scripting work. Confirming the news, Thiagarajan , who’s acquired the remake rights, says, “A lot of reports about who would direct the film were making the rounds. But we had approached only Mohan Raja. The pre-production work is almost over, and the film will go on floors in February. Raja and I went to Mumbai last week and sat with Sriram Raghavan (director of Andhadhun) for two days to discuss the film. We spoke to him about what he thought he could have done differently after the film released, about certain scenes, what he did why he did... He spent three hours on the first day and five hours the next day with us. He was happy that the film was being made in Tamil. In fact, it was only recently that I told Sriram I’d remade his Johnny Gaddar as Johnny with Prashanth. He is a south Indian and speaks good Tamil.”Ask him if he approached Raja because he’s successfully handled remakes before, and the actor-director-producer retorts, “No, not at all. Raja is a commercially successful director. All his films have resonated with the audiences, and he can handle all kinds of scripts. His Thani Oruvan and Velaikkaran, which did really well and won critical acclaim, were his own scripts. We chose him because he can do justice to the kind of sensibilities that Andhadhun reflects. In fact, we were worried he might not want to do a remake as he’s planning to make a pan-India film in three-four languages.”Andhadhun, starring Ayushmann Khurrana , Tabu and Radhika Apte, won multiple National Awards. “It was also screened in countries like China, Korea and Japan and was loved by audiences the world over. So, I want to do justice to the remake,” says Thiagarajan, who is confident that Prashanth is an apt fit to play the lead. “Prashanth has completed four stages of piano in Trinity College. He’s been practising piano for the last six months. He’s lost a whopping 22 kilos and has gone to Malaysia to train more and reduce another five kilos,” he says. The rest of the cast and technical team is yet to be finalised. “Amit Trivedi’s compositions are the soul of the film. So, we are looking at locking a composer who can create that kind of magic. We should be announcing the rest of the cast soon,” he signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73487159,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-318373/73487159.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/mohan-raja-and-i-spent-two-days-with-sriram-raghavan-to-discuss-andhadhun-thiagarajan/articleshow/73487159.cms
4,['22/01/2020'],Raksh is Bangalore Times Most Desirable Man on TV 2019,"If television saw a comeback of sorts in 2019, it was of Raksh , who returned to the small screen with the TV show Gattimela . While his earlier stint in the show Puttagowri Maduve made him a face to watch out for, the new show seems to have sealed a place for him in the hearts of Kannada television viewers… so much so that he tops our list of Bangalore Times Most Desirable Man on TV, 2019.It is honestly overwhelming. It is a big boost when you’ve been putting in a lot of hard work and something like this comes your way. It only encourages you to work harder. People may say hard work is what is needed and results don’t matter, but I say that they do. It took me some time to come here. Now that I have got here, I feel blessed.I have my roots in theatre, and television was never part of my plan. My mind was set on films. I signed up for two films, which didn’t take off. That’s when I decided to give television a shot. It was only after I started that I realised how big the medium was. In just two years after I signed up for Puttagowri Maduve, I was already so close to achieving my dream — of being able to reach out to people. But then, Puttagowri Maduve was a female-centric one and did not give me the opportunity to really showcase my talent as much as I hoped for. I got that break with Gattimela, which set sail last year. I had only requested the makers to ensure that the character that was etched out stayed put and to leave the rest to me. They did that, and soon enough, the show began to get good viewer ratings. If Puttagowri Maduve paved the way to pursue my passion, Gattimela allowed me to showcase what I am really capable of.I do take time out to reply to each of the messages that I receive on social media. It is interesting to see how audiences react to each character you play onscreen. In my earlier show, my character had shades of grey, but people now love the new character I have been playing.To be called a desirable actor, one needs to have the ability to act effortlessly and consistently.I look up to Yash . He began as an actor on the small screen and has grown to be a star who is known nationally. My childhood idol, though, has always been Shah Rukh Khan . My study room was filled with his posters. He has influenced generations of actors, including me.I come from a family filled with engineers and doctors. I tried to follow suit, and took up science initially. But during graduation, I decided to pursue what I felt I had the aptitude for. My goal was to ensure I had a good educational background. Though I have not pursued law as a career, the various moot court sessions and ability to understand case studies has helped me understand the world better.I am a foodie and I love non-vegetarian food. During college, I would easily eat two plates of biryanis at one sitting. Over the years, I have learnt to control these urges. It is important for an actor to be disciplined, look good and maintain your physique. Being part of TV, this is a requirement right through the year, as we do not really have gaps between schedules during which you could afford to let go or relax. If you tend to slack here, people will overtake you in a moment.I am yet to meet that crazy female fan who gives me that unforgettable story. But, yes, there have been many requests for selfies. Since my wife Anusha prefers to maintain a low profile, I have had female fans telling me that they love me after clicking that selfie, without realising that my wife is right next to me.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73490687,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-139564/73490687.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/kannada/raksh-is-bangalore-times-most-desirable-man-on-tv-2019/articleshow/73490822.cms

And now, I’m happy to get a second chance to work with Seenu sir,” Vishwa tells us, “I play a Sri Lankan youngster who migrates to Chennai for work. How his life changes after he meets and falls in love with a girl who works in a spa here is what the film will explore. It will be an entertainer, but steeped in reality.

Also, the film will not be titled Spa,” informs Vishwa.The actor is presently taking diction lessons for his role. “I’m learning Sri Lankan Tamil from a coach in Tiruvannamalai now.

While its director Bibin Paul Samuel and scriptwriter Tobit Chirayath have worked on the script for over four years, the cast too had allotted time and effort to be physically ready for the movie.Bibin, who had wrapped up the film’s production on Monday, tells us, “It was an enjoyable and yet gruelling experience for all of us. We had actors who never had undergone physical fitness routine show up and put in close to four months of training to improve their strength to do the movie. By the end of it, all their palms were bruised and full of calluses.”The film’s lead role is played by Indrajith , who will be seen in two get-ups in the movie as a 30-year-old and a 55-year-old. On casting him, Bibin says, “This project is a sports-drama and while casting for lead actors now, people look for actors who have market value. Indraettan’s solo movies might not have fetched those yet but I was confident that he was perfect for our character. Once we started working, it was clear that we put our money on the right horse. He was willing to push himself for the role and performed remarkable while playing a spirited tug-of-war leader and also as a depressed man in the 50s who returns as a coach.”Physically too, Bibin says the actor had put in the effort to play the two phases of the character. “If we had more time, I am sure Indraettan would have been able to bring about a remarkable transformation for the character,” he says, adding that the original Aaha Neeloor ’s team captain Roy Neeloor had been on the sets to help with the team’s preparations for the sport.The team is currently looking for a Vishu release for the movie, which also has Ashwin K Kumar, Amith Chakalakkal and Santhy Balachandran in pivotal roles.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73481622,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-116820/73481622.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/indrajith-was-willing-to-push-himself-for-his-character-in-aaha/articleshow/73481622.cms

Anurag says, “Nandini and I have been living together since four years, after I proposed to her in February 2016.

8,['22/01/2020'],"Ravindra Jadeja is the apt ‘Mamba’ today, he strikes out of nowhere: Jonty Rhodes","During his most recent visit to Bengaluru for the Global Sports Injury Conclave, former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes was in the mood to talk about a topic that has caught his fancy lately — Bollywood. While Gully Boy is apparently the first film he has “watched properly”, he spoke to us about films and even gave us a glimpse of what it is like to be the fielding coach for cricket teams year after year. Excerpts:I would probably pick Ravindra Jadeja. He is like a python, he strikes from nowhere. You don’t see him coming, and he runs effortlessly. If it is someone like me or even Suresh Raina, you can see us putting an effort; getting dirty, diving everywhere — but Jadeja doesn’t even look like he is raising a sweat. He doesn’t miss stumps and is so quick that he doesn’t have to dive. He is a phenomenal fielder for India. Manish Pandey is also great — he’s taken great catches in the boundary.Young commentators often talk about the time players spend in the gym and of good core strength, but on the field, every part of your body is working. It is good see that young Indian players are learning the importance of fielding and building their skills. For a long time, players were hesitant to give it their all because the state of some of the stadiums is worrisome. If you dive half-hearted, you are more prone to injury than you would be if you are fully committed.Actually, I am very embarrassed to say that Gully Boy is the first Bollywood movie I have watched properly despite my long association with the country. On an earlier occasion, I had watched a part of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. I was part of the Mumbai IPL team then, and we were playing a match in Ahmedabad. Harbhajan Singh was with us, and he took us to his friend’s movie theatre — it was a compact screening theatre with 20 seats and half the squad came. However, there were no subtitles. So, by the intermission, Harbhajan told me, that I could go and that he didn’t expect me to stay on (chuckles).What I couldn’t understand in Bollywood was how in the middle of the movie, there was a song and a dance, and then they would immediately go back to fighting and punching each other. In that sense, Gully Boy was an easier acceptance. It is a song about music, dance and poetry woven into the movie. When I met Siddhant Chaturvedi (who plays MC Sher in the movie), a year ago, I heard the songs, and had not watched the movie. And I had really enjoyed it. I do believe that I haven’t done enough justice to discovering Bollywood. There has been more ignorance on my part, but I really, really enjoyed watching this movie.Strangely, getting on and off buses that take you to and from the stadium or airport, involves a bit of jostling around. For instance, when Sachin Tendulkar was playing for the Mumbai IPL team, a lot of effort would go into ensuring the crowd around was cleared before we could get the players on and off the bus. But other than that, decent cricket players have fairly good coordination. There are some clumsy guys, but fortunately, there have been no instances of slipping in the bathroom and falling over, or anything of that sort.Very often. After an entire season of coaching during a tournament, we then meet 10 months later at the start of a new season. But at that point, we have to start all over again, because the intensity of training during this gap has not been the same. Cricket is a game of habit, so we need to get to the basics and emphasise, to coaches and players alike, that maintaining one’s training intensity through the year is important. This is a message I have been trying to impart to players at the grass root level too.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73484965,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-175814/73484965.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/ravindra-jadeja-is-the-apt-mamba-today-he-strikes-out-of-nowhere-jonty-rhodes/articleshow/73484965.cms

10,['22/01/2020'],Impeachment trial begins in US Senate with swift Trump acquittal on cards,"This story is from January 22, 2020

WASHINGTON: The United States Senate on Tuesday began the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump , with a loyal Republican majority in the chamber signaling a swift acquittal of its unchallenged commander in a case that has dominated Washington politics for months.

The Republican leadership of the 100-member Senate, which will act as the jury and where the GOP has a 53-47 majority, framed ground rules aimed at blocking all Democratic efforts to stage an elaborate trial. Almost anything Democrats want, from admitting evidence from the House (where Democrats have a majority and which chamber impeached the President) to calling witnesses, will run up against a firewall of a Republican majority under rules resolution unveiled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell late Monday night, a political ploy that earned him the moniker “Midnight Mitch” on social media.

Having ensured that all 53 Senators, including moderates such as Susan Collins and past critics such as Mitt Romney, are in sync with the party line, Trump confidently flew out to Davos for the World Economic Summit, where he denounced the trial with the usual tirade about it being a witchhunt and a hoax. A quick exoneration by the Senate will also clear the road for a trip to India that could happen with weeks, even days, according to some reports.

It is only the third time in U.S history that an American President has been impeached by the House and is undergoing a trial in the Senate, but the cult of personality surrounding the event is unprecedented. Even Republicans Senators who are retiring (such as Tenessee’s Lamar Alexander ) or past critics who have just been elected for a six-year term (Utah’s Mitt Romney), are leery of going against a President who claims a 95 per cent support among the party rank and file.

Moderate Republicans and fence-sitters facing tough re-election in November such as Maine’s Susan Collins have made pro-forma remarks about wanting a fair process, giving hope to Democrats (who need just four GOP Senators to back them in votes on rule changes that will allow witness testimony etc). But the GOP leadership appears to have the flock well under control, shepherding lawmakers with raw political power.

A typical example was on show on the Hill over the weekend when Martha McSally, a Republican Senator who faces a tough re-election in Arizona, publicly put down Manu Raju, a veteran Congressional reporter, when he asked her if the Senate should consider new evidence that has surfaced about Trump pressuring Ukraine (which forms the basis of impeachment on grounds of abuse of power) as part of the impeachment trial. ""Manu, you’re a liberal hack. I’m not talking to you,"" McSally told him as she sailed into her office.

The public smackdown earned plaudits from the Republican leadership, which in turn asked the loyal GOP/Trump base to contribute well to her re-election, setting the campaign cash register ringing. In the past, Republican lawmakers who have challenged Trump or have not backed him fully, have been “primaried” – defeated in inner-party elections by candidates backed the President – with the added honor of being chewed up on Twitter by the volatile President. The result: more than 25 Republican lawmakers have announced their retirement over the past two years rather than take on the President.

Those who remain are now solidly behind the President, with not a single GOP House Representative voting for impeaching Trump. A similar firewall is expected to protect Trump in the Senate trial, despite the past reputation of the senior lawmakers being very independent-minded.

In fact, so confident is the Senate Republican leadership of its hold on GOP Senators that the organizing resolution circulated by Mitch McConnell allots each side 24 hours to make its opening arguments, but it is compressed into two session days, which means, the trial, scheduled to start at 1 p.m on Wednesday with Chief Justice John Roberts presiding, will run well into the night and into the wee hours, ensuring few people watch it. Democrats and liberals are already denouncing it as a farce unbecoming of a democracy.

The U.S Senate, at one time regarded as the most deliberative body in the world, is lately seen as an increasingly partisan body, with liberal critics deriding the Republican majority as a ""old white boys’ club."" Because the chamber reflects a geographical/cartographic representation of U.S.(two Senators per state), Senators from thinly-populated, mostly-white states (such as Wyoming, Vermont etc), are elected by fewer voters than would elect a member of the House of Representatives (elected by approximately 711,000 voters per constituency).

Seven American states -- Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota , South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming have only one Representative (also called Congressman/Congresswoman) -- but two Senators. This effectively means the Republican majority in the geographically represented 100-member Senate – now poised to exonerate Trump -- has a veto over the popularly- and demographically represented 435-member House of Representatives, where the Democrat-majority impeached the President.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he and Pakistan ’s Prime Minister Imran Khan are “working together on some borders” and discussing the Kashmir issue ahead of Trump's visit to India expected to take place in February.“We're working together on some borders, and we're talking about Kashmir and the relation to what's going on with Pakistan and India. And if we can help, we certainly will be helping. And we've been watching that and following it very, very closely,” Trump said in remarks on Tuesday, ahead of his meeting with Imran Khan on the sidelines of the World Economic Summit, in Davos , Switzerland.It was not immediately clear what Trump meant by “working together on some borders,” but US officials, including during recent visits to Pakistan, have been impressing on Islamabad to stop cross-border terrorism and bankrolling of terror groups directing attacks against India.Pakistan in turn has accused India of adopting an aggressive stance at the border and sought US help in not only defusing the situation but also in getting Pakistan out of the Financial Action Task Force listing as it complies with its requirements. The Trump administration and the international community is yet to be convinced that Pakistan has met all the metrics.In his brief remarks, Imran Khan too pressed Trump to play an active role in resolving tensions with India. “For us, in Pakistan, it (India) is a big issue. And, of course, we always hope that the US will play its part in resolving it because no other country can,” Khan said, in a repetition of his plea he made to Trump during his visit to the White House in July 2019.India has dismissed multiple Trump offers to play the role of a mediator as unnecessary while reiterating issues with Pakistan are bilateral in nature and can be resolved without third party intervention.Trump also implicitly confirmed an upcoming visit to India while saying a concurrent visit to Pakistan was not on the cards. “Well, we're visiting right now, so we won't really have to,” he said in response to a question whether he will also be visit Pakistan, suggesting that since he has met Khan in Davos there would be no visit.“But we -- I wanted to say hello for both a relationship standpoint -- we've had a great relationship -- and from the standpoint of our two countries. We're getting along very well. I would say we've never been closer with Pakistan than we are right now. And that's a big statement, although I wouldn't say at all times we were close, as a country. But we are very close right now because of the relationship that we have. So it's very important,” Trump said.Although he has met Prime Minister Modi several times over the past three years, Trump is expected to visit India in February for his first official visit as President, depending on the outcome of the impeachment trial in the Senate that began on Wednesday. A swift exoneration is expected to lead to a quick India visit, in part to burnish his foreign policy legacy and trade and business chops ahead of the November Presidential election.Read this story in BengaliIn Video: Prez Donald Trump again offers 'help' over Kashmir during meet with PM Imran Khan in Davos",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73500502,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-329646,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/donald-trump-says-hes-discussing-kashmir-issue-with-imran-khan/articleshow/73500413.cms

15,['22/01/2020'],Ranji Trophy: Bipul slams ton as Chandigarh look for bonus-point win,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Panaji: With two wickets down for 87 in 27 overs in the second innings, after conceding a first-innings lead of 329 against Chandigarh, Goa have a task on their hands in the Plate Division Ranji Trophy at the Academy ground, Porvorim, on Tuesday.

Riding on Bipul Sharma ’s unbeaten 103, Chandigarh declared their first innings for 580-7 in 150 overs. Opener Shivam Bhambri top scored with 157 off 287 balls. Goa scored 251 in their first innings.

Goa opener Sumiran Amonkar (21, 74 balls, 3x4) and night watchman Amulya Pandrekar (6, 11b) were at the crease at the end of the third day’s play.

With 27 overs to play, Goa had a mountain to climb and opener Aditya Kaushik’s horrible run continued as he failed once again. He perished for 15 when he gave a catch to Arslan Khan at short midwicket off right-arm medium pacer Jagjit Singh. Aditya has managed to score 138 in nine innings. His top score, 73, came against Bihar.

Smit Patel was the other man to get out after getting a good start. He played with a straight bat and looked set for a long inning until he charged left-arm orthodox spinner Gurinder Singh and missed the line and length to get bowled on 40 off 46 balls. Goa needed someone to bat throughout as the hosts can only draw after Chandigarh put up a big total.

Resuming on an overnight score of 310-3, Chandigarh relied on middle-order batsmen and two big partnerships. Right-arm medium pacer Lakshay Garg removed Shivam when the centurion nicked one to wicketkeeper Smit. Slow left-arm orthodox spinners Amulya and Darshan Misal failed to get any wickets.

Ankit Kaushik (89, 120b, 11x4, 2x6) and Bipul (146b, 8x4, 2x6) then strengthen Chandigarh’s hold on the game. The pair put up 123 for the fifth wicket.

Goa captain Amit Verma took two quick wickets of Ankit and Jaskaranvir Singh. However, Bipul and Gurinder Singh (33, 34b, 1x4, 1x6) added 61 for the eighth wicket to place Chandigarh comfortably at 517-8.

The visitors declared soon after Bipul scored the eighth century of his career.

With Puducherry (33 points) winning their match against Arunachal Pradesh on the third day and claiming the top spot in the group, Chandigarh will aim for a bonus-point victory, which will take them to the second place. Chandigarh will play Puducherry next, while Goa has an easy match against Arunachal at home.

Brief scores: Goa 251 (Suyash Prabhudessai 90; Jagjit Singh Sandhu 5-64, Shresth Nirmohi 3-38) & 87-2 in 27 overs (Smit Patel 40, Sumiran Amonkar 21*) vs Chandigarh 580-7 decl in 150 overs (Shivam Bhambri 157, Bipul Sharma 103*, Manan Vohra 102, Ankit Kaushik 89; Amit Verma 3-95)",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bipul-slams-ton-as-chandigarh-look-for-bonus-point-win/articleshow/73501239.cms

23,['22/01/2020'],Forced intervals in Hollywood films: Convenience or irritant?,"While moviegoers complain that the abrupt intervals ruin the viewing experience, cinemas say breaks are essential for F&B business as well as for viewers' comfortLast Friday, the Oscar-nominated film 1917 – which has won three Golden Globes including the award for best picture – was released in India. Among many excited fans was filmmaker Vikramaditya Motwane , who took to social media to urge the audience to watch the ""beautiful film"", but he also appealed to the cinema halls to screen the film without an interval , in order to not ruin the movie-watching experience.'1917' was filmed to look like a continuous shot, but like most Hollywood releases in India, the film has an abrupt interval. In the west, films mostly don't have intervals but in India, cinemas insert an intermission, dividing the film into two parts.When we spoke to cinemas, they told us that intervals are important from the business perspective of cinema halls as well as viewers' convenience perspective.If you are one of those moviegoers who don't want cinemas to ruin your viewing experience by abruptly cutting a film midway for an interval, the bad news is that cinemas are not going to do away with intervals any time soon because that spells revenue loss.Tinku Singh, Group President, SRS Cinemas, says, ""This is no secret that cinemas make the biggest chunk of profit from F&B sales, and not movie tickets. Hence, removing intervals will lead to revenue losses. So we go ahead with our usual practice of having intermissions in films. Which film should have a break and which shouldn't, how audience will react to no breaks – all these issues will have to be discussed if cinemas ever decide to do away with intervals. Besides, even Hollywood films are getting longer now, with the runtime often exceeding two hours.""A distributor, who's also a member of the Motion Pictures Association, says, ""When the 95- minutes-long Dhobi Ghat (2010) was released without an interval, this issue as to why Hollywood films should have intervals was discussed. But cinemas opposed the idea of removing intervals. The fact is that intervals can’t be done away with because it clearly means further losses for the cinemas, which are already not earning huge profits.”While most Hindi and other Indian language films are created in a format having two halves, it's not the case with most Hollywood films. So the inserted breaks often obstruct the flow of the film. Moviegoers have complained that cinema halls cut a scene or even a dialogue in the middle to announce an interval, which completely spoils the movie-watching experience. Rajendra Singh Jyala, Chief Programming Officer at INOX Leisure Limited , says, ""Unfortunately, we don't get Hollywood films in advance to decide where to insert an interval. Say a Hollywood film is two hours long, so we cut it at an hour. However, after the first show, if we see that the interval is interrupting a dialogue or an important scene, then we make modifications and insert an interval a few minutes before or after.""A still from the World War One epic 1917However, not all halls correct the practice and intervals continue to be abrupt, inconveniencing the audience. But when asked if they are making moviegoers unhappy by including these breaks, theatres say that while some people may have an issue, there are many who will object if they decide to do away with intervals.We reached out to PVR Cinemas, Carnival Cinemas, Wave Cinemas and Cinepolis but we had no response from them till the time of going to pressA still from the Tom Hanks-starrer A Beautiful Day In The Neighbourhood Not just in 1917, recent big releases like the multi-starrer Bombshell and Tom Hank's A Beautiful Day In The Neighbourhood, have intervals cropping up at abrupt moments.Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie in BombshellRajendra Singh Jayala adds, ""We insert intervals for the convenience of the audience. In the past, there have been a few instances when we did screen a few Hollywood films without an interval. These films were around 1 hour 20 minutes long, but those are rare instances. Otherwise, we screen all Hollywood films with an interval. It is for the convenience of the audience. People need a break to buy popcorn or to freshen up. In Indian cinema, we have a tradition of intervals. We have continued with the tradition of intervals for Hollywood films too.""",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73484984,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-153387/73484984.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/english/hollywood/news/forced-intervals-in-hollywood-films-convenience-or-irritant/articleshow/73484670.cms

We are a country of Harishankar Parsai, who wrote amazing satire and we are a country that made Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (1983). All of these writings and films were funny but also deeply political. Vivek Oberoi (her co-star in a web series) and I have discussed everything — from the Trump presidency to India to Brexit, and we never agree on things, but at least, I feel comfortable to have that discussion with him. It is perhaps because I have worked with him longer. Kangana and I, we never discussed politics. We just didn’t. Also, ours is a democracy. You work with people you may or may not agree with.The boom in the digital space has helped a lot of actors. Shefali Shah, Neeraj Kabi, Amit Sial.. these actors are finding good work and their visibility makes me happy. They deserve to be stars in their own right. I have done a lot of supporting roles in my career and I have no issues with that. I didn’t come into the industry with the news of a big affair or a famous boyfriend that the media won’t stop talking about. I didn’t have a producer dad. I had to start somewhere, and I feel that I have done well for myself. I haven’t done one naach gaana film and it’s a miracle that I exist. I am glad to have proved a lot of people wrong.Does stereotyping happen? Of course! The casting directors need to know that. I feel certain casting directors are more destructive to outsiders than producers. They have their prejudices. Barring Honey Trehan who insisted that I should be in Fukrey (2013), I have never been cast by a casting director in any of my films. Honey pushed me to do Fukrey when other casting directors told me not to do it as they wanted to plug their own people. Writer-filmmaker Kanu Behl auditioned me for Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye (2008). He was Dibakar Banerjee ’s assistant director (AD) then. He saw me in a play and wanted to cast me. Filmmaker Vasan Bala auditioned me for Dev.D (2009) through someone’s reference. He was also an AD with Anurag Kashyap . From that audition, I got Gangs Of Wasseypur (2012). As far as being glamorous is concerned, I’ll be that off the screen. That’s my motto. Because on screen toh mar jayenge na log. Saavli ladki? Glamorous?Why don’t you ask Bhumi (Pednekar) and me? Yes, the situation is better now, as we do have duskier actresses, but just observe this. An actress who gets launched at 20, look at her skin tone at 34. It’s completely different. What happened there?I did stand-up for fun as I wanted to do something that was scary. As far as voice-over is concerned, again, that’s the problem of casting directors and how myopic the industry is. I wonder why they haven’t seen that side of me. Recently, I was dancing at a party and some film colleagues asked me, ‘Wow, you can dance! Since you did Fukrey, we weren’t sure if you could.’ People still come to me and ask if I can speak English as I did Gangs Of Wasseypur. I don’t care about what these people say anymore.Ali is a sweetheart. He was expected to reach at 8pm for the show, as I was to perform at 8.30. He showed up at 6.30 with coffee and cookies for everyone. He is extremely supportive. I couldn’t have asked for a better man in my life. Our relationship is a great creative partnership. No one that sees us together feels like it’s a mismatch. It wasn’t unnerving to have him in the audience at all. My friend, Ali and my brother Pranav were all sitting together. I made jokes about my family, too. It was nice that people liked it and were pleasantly surprised by my comic side.I said it’s a miracle because it’s rare to find like-minded people who share certain core values and have similar interests like poetry, music, films and literature. Ali is also progressive and liberal. To find someone like that in your industry is rare. Also, we never expected to end up together. It happened organically.We don’t have time. If we were to talk about marriage, it will be like... I don’t have dates in March, May is too hot, we are shooting a film in June, it rains too much in July... It will become like a line production job. We are waiting and chilling, and we are in a happy space.Not at all. That film has such a great cast. It has Armie Hammer and he is also hot. Ali and I never get jealous about these things. We are partners who are excited about each other’s careers. I am so happy that he is getting such good work abroad.

NEW DELHI: Actor Soni Razdan ’s tweet describing the hanging of terror accused Afzal Guru “a travesty of justice” sparked a social media controversy on Tuesday. Razdan, actor Alia Bhatt ’s mother, said Afzal was made a “scapegoat” and demanded an inquiry into his handing.

“This is a travesty of justice. Who is going to bring back a man from the dead if he is innocent. This is why the death penalty is not to be used lightly. And this is why there also needs to be a solid enquiry into why Afzal Guru was made the scapegoat ,” she tweeted.

The tweet created a buzz on Twitter with many people criticising her.

BJP spokesperson Shaina NC tweeted, “Hey @Soni_Razdan my dear, #AfzalGuru a hardened criminal cum terrorist who attacked our parliament in 2001, and was pronounced guilty and hung until death in 2013. 12 years based on evidence, is no travesty of justice. If we have no fear of law, what precedent are we setting?” Razdan defended her stand and wrote, “No one is saying he is innocent. But if he was tortured and then ordered by his torturer to do what he did isn’t that what needed to be fully investigated? Why did no one take his allegations about Devinder (sic) Singh seriously. That’s the travesty.”

31,['22/01/2020'],SC to decide if pleas on Article 370 should go to seven-judge bench,"This story is from January 22, 2020

NEW DELHI: Before testing the validity of the Centre’s decision to scrap J&K’s special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and its reorganisation into two Union Territories, a five-judge bench of the SC on Tuesday said it would first decide whether to refer the contentious constitutional issue to a seven-judge bench.

Senior advocates Dinesh Dwivedi and Sanjay Parikh, appearing for Prem Shankar Jha and NGO ‘People’s Union for Civil Liberties’ respectively, told a bench of Justices N V Ramana, Sanjay K Kaul, B Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant that there were three SC rulings by five-judges benches on the nature and character of Article 370 which were conflicting and sought reference of the matter to a seven-judge bench. Attorney general K K Venugopal said, “I oppose the plea to refer the petitions to a seven-judge bench.”

Dwivedi and Parikh cited two over 50-year-old rulings by five-judge benches, in Prem Nath Kaul case and Sampat Prakash case, in which the SC had said Parliament could not change the character of Article 370 which gave special status to the state as it was in the form of a constitutional obligation that arose from the instrument of accession signed by the maharaja of Kashmir. They said the third judgment by another five-judge bench had ruled to the contrary while recognising Parliament’s power to amend Article 370.

In Prem Nath Kaul case [AIR 1959 SC 749], the SC had said, “Neither the scheme of Article 370 nor the explanation to clause (1) of that article contemplated that the maharaja was to be a constitutional ruler. The temporary provisions of that article were based on the assumption that the ultimate relationship between India and the state should be finally determined by the constituent assembly of the state itself. So, that article could not, either expressly or by implication, be intended to limit the plenary legislative powers of the maharaja. Till the constituent assembly of the state, therefore, made its decision, the Instrument of Accession must hold the field.”

In Sampat Prakash case [AIR 1970 SC 1118], the SC had said, “The political situation that existed when Article 370 was incorporated in the Constitution had not materially altered either in 1959 or 1964 and the purpose of introducing it was to empower the President to exercise his discretion in applying the Indian Constitution while that situation remained unchanged. Article 370(3) envisages that the article will continue to be operative until and can cease to be operative only on the recommendation of constituent assembly of the state, the President makes a direction to that effect. No such recommendation was made nor was any order made by the President. On the contrary, the constituent assembly of the state made a recommendation that the article should be operative with a modified explanation.”

Arguments will continue on Wednesday.

32,['22/01/2020'],Rajini stirs a storm with Periyar remark,"This story is from January 22, 2020

(File photo)

CHENNAI: Even as activists of several Periyarist movements demanded an apology from actor Rajinikanth for his comment against noted social reformer E V R Periyar while referring to a rally taken out in Salem by the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1971, the actor on Tuesday refused to apologise or express regret for his remarks. Periyar founded DK, which was based on rationalist thought. DMK is an offshoot of DK.

At the golden jubilee celebrations of the Tamil magazine Thuglak in Chennai last week, Rajinikanth had said “portraits of Rama and Sita without clothes, decorated with garlands of slippers” were carried by people in the rally. “I did not say anything that was a figment of my imagination nor anything that was untrue,” he said, adding “the issue needs to be forgotten, not denied.”

“My recent speech at the Thuglak function has raised a controversy. What I said was based on what I read and what I heard. If someone expects me to apologise and express regret for it, I am sorry. I will neither apologise nor express regret,” Rajinikanth told reporters outside his Poes Garden residence in Chennai, flashing a photocopy of an article that appeared in an English magazine in 2017.

An infuriated DMK government ordered for the copies of Thuglak to be seized, leading to a spike in demand for the magazine, the actor added. Soon, Periyarists from various organisations condemned Rajinikanth for his speech and denied that the rally had carried portraits that depicted Rama and Sita in a derogatory fashion and demanded his apology. Some political parties like VCK threatened to gherao his residence and police complaints were filed against the actor by Periyarists. “Let them say what they want. I will stand by what I said,” Rajinikanth further said.

Meanwhile, a group of Periyarists staged a protest in the city asking Rajinikanth to apologise. They also threatened to march towards his house, but police prevented them. Dravidar Kazhagam general secretary K Veeramani too joined issue with Rajinikanth. “He is answerable to the court. We will meet him in the court,” Veeramani told TOI.

DMK president M K Stalin asked Rajinikanth to think before he talked about Periyar. “Rajinikanth is an actor. Not a politician. Periyar spent a major part of his 95 years working for the welfare of Tamils. Rajinikanth should think twice before saying anything about Periyar,” Stalin said.

AIADMK too was quick in coming to Periyar’s defense. “One should speak about Periyar only after understanding his ideology. His ideologies are to be treated with respect and enshrined on a high pedestal,” said deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam . CM Edappadi K Palaniswami steered clear of the issue at a public meeting in Salem.

35,['22/01/2020'],What's the status of mercy plea of Rajiv convict: SC,"This story is from January 22, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought to know from Tamil Nadu the status of a mercy plea filed by Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict A G Perarivalan before the governor seeking suspension of his life sentence since he has already spent more than 28 years in prison.

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta asked the state government to inform the court about the fate of the mercy plea filed under Article 161 of the Constitution, which lays down the power of governor to grant pardons and to suspend, remit or commute sentences awarded by a court in certain cases.

Perarivalan was convicted and sentenced to death for procuring batteries for the bomb that an LTTE cadre used to trigger the blast which killed the former PM in 1991. Perarivalan, who at the time of crime was 19 years old, had pleaded that he did not know for what purpose the accused had asked him to procure the batteries. The SC had in February 2014 commuted the death sentence awarded to him and two others - Murugan and Santhan - to life term on the ground that their mercy petitions had not been decided for a very long time.

After dealing with Perarivalan's plea, the bench turned its focus to the working of the Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Committee, set up in 1998 on the recommendations of the Jain Commission , to inquire into the larger conspiracy behind Rajiv Gandhi's assassination. The bench told additional solicitor general Pinky Anand that probe status reports filed in April 1998 and November 2019 were identical and sought an explanation.

Anand said the MDMA's work was hampered as there was no response to letters rotatory sent to other countries, including Sri Lanka which in 1991 was the hotbed of LTTE activities. The SC asked the government to provide details of the progress made in the investigation in the last two years.

CHANDIGARH: New BJP chief JP Nadda ’s attempt to settle the ongoing tussle between Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar and his home minister Anil Vij over control of the state’s criminal investigation department has not been successful. Vij remained adamant on removal of ADGP Anil Kumar Rao, who heads the department.

Naddasummoned Khattar and Vij to the party headquarters in New Delhi late on Monday night in an attempt to mediate between the two.

After a two-hour meeting till midnight — it was also attended by BJP organisational secretary BL Santosh — both Khattar and Vij left the party headquarters for Haryana Bhawan together in a car, sending a signal that their differences had been sorted.

Khattar returned to Chandigarh on Tuesday to join a two-day training camp being organised in the assembly for first-time legislators. Vij, however, chose to stay back in New Delhi and made his stance clear by insisting on disciplinary action against Rao, who also heads the CM’s flying squad and is considered a close confidant of Khattar.

Announcing the visit, the MEA spokesperson said, “It is expected to further enhance and strengthen the multi-faceted ties between India and Brazil.” Bolsonaro has been at the centre of global ire over forest fires in Amazon, which many allege is a deliberate act to clear grazing and agricultural land. Bolsonaro has been engaged in verbal skirmishes with French President Emmanuel Macron as also actor Leonardo di Caprio over the fires.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bolsonaro are expected to focus on bilateral ties. Bolsonaro is believed to be bringing with him a large business delegation representing over 50 companies spanning agro-processing to defence. For India, it will be important to sign the new model investment pact with Brazil. The Modi government had scrapped investment treaties with 50 international partners in 2018, but its new model has found virtually no takers. Incidentally, the new text is similar to those by Brazil and Indonesia , but has been almost rejected by European countries and even Australia , as offering too little protection.

The Brazilian economy, like that of India is going through a slowdown, so both sides would be looking for activities to increase growth.

NEW DELHI: India and Nepal opened their second integrated check-post (ICP) on the Jogbani-Biratnagar border on Tuesday, with both Prime Ministers, Narendra Modi and KP Sharma Oli, jointly inaugurating the facility.

The Rs 140 crore ICP built with Indian assistance and spread over 260 acres is the second after the Raxaul-Birgunj one which was opened in 2018. Officials said it can handle over 500 trucks daily.

Modi said India is committed to simplifying and smoothening traffic with all friendly countries in the neighbourhood. “India and Nepal are working on several cross-border connectivity projects such as road, rail and transmission lines,” he said.

The two Prime Ministers also reviewed the progress in Indian-assisted post-2015 earthquake housing reconstruction projects in Nepal. Out of India’s commitment to build 50,000 houses in Gorkha and Nuwakot, 45,000 have already been completed.

National security advisor Ajit Doval , foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale and Nepal’s ambassador to India Nilambar Acharya attended the event in New Delhi.

In a statement in Kathmandu , the Indian embassy said the ICP has integrated three main border related functions — customs, immigration and border security — to facilitate movement of both passenger and freight traffic between the two countries.

For re-building earthquake-resilient 50,000 private houses in Gorkha and Nuwakot districts, India has pledged USD 100 million and USD 50 million soft loan.

Why Kolkatans root for their favourite biryani

A comfort food

In 2019, Kolkata ordered 39 lakh mutton biryani and 25 lakh chicken biryani on food apps, making it the fifth Indian city to place the maximum orders for biryani after Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. While the City of Joy’s love affair with this dish is much talked about, the latest data prompted us to take a relook at the goodness of our very own Kolkata biryani along with its all-new avatars. Prepared with aromatic rice, tender meat and select masalas, the Kolkata biryani has been cheering up foodies for more than a century now. And what sets it apart from its Hyderabadi or Awadhi counterparts is the aloo, which lends the dish a distinct flavour.Among other fast food items, biryani is pocket-friendly, feel city students. Ayush Banerjee, a student of Jadavpur University, says, “It’s not possible for students like us to order costly delicacies from posh restaurants. I am a regular customer at a small biryani joint near my university. Though the quality is not great, it serves decent biryani for a really affordable price.” Sambit Banik, the chef and owner of a restaurant on Sarat Bose Road, said, “We serve experimental Mughlai cuisine. We sell around 400 plates of mutton biryani on any given day and 250 plates of chicken biryani daily. Our most ordered dish is the classic Lucknowi dum style, followed by our special Hyderabadi sofiana biryani made with almond milk and aromatic spices.” Another student, Sudipta Sarkar, who is originally from Maldah and now resides in Jadavpur, said, ""Biryani is quite popular in Maldah but the variety that's available in Kolkata is so different and delectable. Since I study in Jadavpur University, the area has a lot of small eateries that sell biryani in affordable prices. Often I head there with my friends when we feel like eating out. It's both tasty and pocket friendly.""The potato in the biryani was introduced by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah when he came to Kolkata, and since he didn’t have enough funds to feed his entourage, the meat in the biryani was replaced with the tuber. Manzilat Fatima, the great-great-granddaughter of the Nawab tells us that the only difference between the Awadhi biryani and Kolkata biryani is that the latter has an aloo in it. “Bengalis choose biryani over any other food perhaps because it’s a rice-based preparation, has a piece of potato, which they love so much. I have gone offline because I couldn’t handle the demand online. I’m cooking 40-50 plates of biryani a day for private orders and my diners combined,” she said.Biryani has now transformed from a sit-down meal to a fast food item. It is the most common ‘first order’ by any new user across different food delivery platforms. Vinay Arorah, owner of a restaurant on Rajdanga Main Road that specialises in handi biryani, informed us that he gets more than 200 online orders for biryani a day. “The number increases by 60-70% during festivals.

ALLAHABAD: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) will help over 1.5 crore refugees from Pakistan , Afghanistan and Bangladesh to get Indian citizenship. VHP seers decided this at the Virat Sant Sammelan at its camp here on Tuesday. The seers also urged that the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya begin from Navaratra .

VHP said its volunteers would conduct a nationwide door-to-door campaign to identify refugees and help them procure necessary documents. Over 17 lakh saints will take part in the special drive.

Saints and seers will also be part of the campaign to inform people about the importance of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register. They will also undertake a special campaign to check conversion in slums and tribal pockets.

The saints said sedition charges should be levelled against those opposing the CAA and decided to chalk out a strategy to counter them. They demanded that the Ram temple be constructed under the leadership of Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas chief Nritya Gopal Das and saints associated with the movement be given representation in the trust to be formed by the government.

Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) president Narendra Giri said, ""Saints and seers will take up the pro-CAA campaign. Every state has to implement the CAA and sedition charges be invoked against those opposing it. There should be more focus on checking conversion.""

LUCKNOW: Taking a dig at the Centre over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ), Urdu poet Munawwar Rana on Tuesday asked why the government was afraid of giving citizenship to Muslims. Rana's two daughters were booked by Lucknow police on Sunday for holding anti-CAA protests at Hussainabad Clock Tower despite prohibitory orders.

The district administration has booked 160 women, including two daughters of Rana, for defying the orders on Monday night. ""This country has a history of upholding its values and giving shelter to the weakest. Why is the government afraid of giving citizenship to Muslims? People have been fighting for 30 years to get citizenship but failed. What 'new' this Act will do,"" asked Rana.

Criticising Tuesday's pro-CAA rally held by home minister Amit Shah here, Rana said: ""Instead of creating awareness of the new Act, they (government) are creating a divide by inviting a section of Hindus to a rally in Bangla Bazaar area of Lucknow while Muslims are protesting in Chowk.""

Speaking about the FIR against his daughters, Rana said: ""I respect the law of the land and agree that my daughters were a part of unlawful assembly. But home minister of the country has also violated the same law. How was he allowed by police to bring lakhs of people from 16 districts? If this country is the land of Ram, Krishna, Nanak and Chisti, then sense of justice must prevail,"" he said.

43,['22/01/2020'],"Giving info for NPR voluntary, says minister","This story is from January 22, 2020

NEW DELHI: Junior minister for home G Kishan Reddy on Tuesday said conducting the National Population Register (NPR) exercise was a constitutional obligation of states and also said sharing of information by the public for the purposes of NPR would be ""voluntary"".

Reddy's statement came a day after Kerala said it will not cooperate with NPR procedures, though it would go ahead with Census 2021. The minister said the Centre and states are constitutionally bound to undertake the NPR exercise, already notified by the Centre and re-notified by all states. NPR, it was underlined, was not started by the BJP-led government but by UPA in 2010 .

On whether sharing details sought in the NPR form was voluntary, Reddy said respondents would be free not to provide information that was not available with them or they were not comfortable sharing. ""If one is not comfortable sharing any information asked during NPR, he or she need not do so,"" he said.

The minister, however, said the Centre would continue to engage with states, including Kerala, and sensitise them on the need as well as utility of information collected through NPR. At the same time, Reddy pointed to an integrated household survey (Samagra Kutumba survey) conducted in 2014 by the Telangana government which had sought far more intrusive details from residents of the state including their bank account details and medical history.

""Many NRIs had to come all the way from Dubai for the survey as participation was mandatory. No questions were raised then by politicians like (Asaduddin) Owaisi. This shows that opposition to NPR is largely politically motivated,""' he said.

A few days ago, home ministry officials had said that while no documents such as passport, voter ID, Aadhaar card and driving licence need be shown to the enumerator, respondents were required to share Aadhaar number, voter ID number, driving licence number and passport details if in possession of these documents.

Asked about the provision in Citizenship Rules, 2003, regarding Rs 1,000 fine for giving incorrect information - particularly as the head of the household must sign an undertaking on the NPR form saying all information provided is true to the best of his or her knowledge - officials said the provision was rarely invoked though it is part of the rules.

A home ministry spokesperson had clarified on Twitter , ""No documents would be asked by the enumerators for the NPR exercise...If the respondents want to present documents, they are free to do so.""

46,['22/01/2020'],Andhra Pradesh: Legislative council to vote on capital bills today,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Andhra Pradesh CM Jaganmohan Reddy

AMARAVATI: Ending the day-long deadlock, the government succeeded in introducing the three capital cities bill titled AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions (APDIDAR) and repeal of the CRDA Act in the legislative council on Tuesday.

The legislative council, however, was adjourned to Wednesday without taking up discussion on three capital cities and CRDA bills.

Finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy introduced the APDIDAR bill while municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayan moved the bill to repeal CRDA Act. Both the bills were cleared by the assembly late on Monday night.

Keeping in view the TDP’s majority in the legislative council, the YSRC was prepared that the bills would be turned down in the council and planned to route them again from the assembly in order to walk away with the law.

However, YSRC was stumped when TDP moved a motion under rule-71 of business rules soon after the commencement of the council. The rule allows the opposition to take up a discussion on any policy of the cabinet and disapprove such decision. TDP wanted to complete the discussion on the motion and reject the government’s policy without allowing the ministers to introduce the bills.

Opposition leader in the council Yanamala Ramakrishnudu moved the motion and argued that they be allowed to initiate discussion on the government’s policy. But finance and legislative affairs minister Rajendranath Reddy opposed the move saying that they should be allowed to introduce the bills before allowing any discussion to be taken up.

The council chairman MA Sheriff, who got elected to the council as TDP nominee, had decided to allow the discussion under rule-71 prompting uproarious protests from YSRC. Curiously, the ministers started protesting against the chairman’s ruling and did not allow the discussion to begin.

The finance minister took strong exception to the chairman’s decision saying that it would lead to constitutional deadlock. He said that not allowing the government to conduct the business was not proper. Nearly 20 ministers were present in the council to take on TDP.

Demanding immediate discussion on the government bills, municipal administration minister Satyanarayana said they would not mind even if the council rejected the bills.

“Preventing the government from conducting the business is against the procedure. Let them reject the bills. We don’t mind. But we should be allowed to introduce the bills in the first place,” said Satyanarayana.

Amidst protests and slogans by the TDP and YSRC members, the chairman kept adjourning the House from morning to evening. He held discussions with both the sides during the breaks but failed to achieve consensus with both the sides sticking to their guns.

Progressive Democratic Forum (PDF) member Vitapu Balasubramanyam and BJP member PNV Madhav said stalling the introduction of the bills in the council was against the Constitution. “The bills have been cleared by the assembly and routed to us. We have a duty to take up discussion irrespective of our views on it. Let the government present the bills first,” said Balasubramanyam.

After five adjournments since morning, the chairman allowed the ministers to move the bills in the council at 6.45 pm.

Rs 1,364 crore canal rejuvenation project will be completed in 42 months

KOCHI: The initial concept report of Integrated Urban Regeneration and Water Transport System Project (IURWTS), launched for renovating five major canals in the city, will be ready in a couple of days. According to Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL), Antea Nederland BV (Netherlands) and Unihorn consortium, the implementing agency of the project, will prepare a detailed project report (DPR) on the basis of concept report within six months.

The Rs 1,364-crore canal rejuvenation project will be completed in 42 months. On Tuesday, a meeting of stakeholders was convened to review the progress of preparations. Hibi Eden, MP, Thrikkakkara MLA P T Thomas, Tripunithura MLA M Swaraj and Ernakulam MLA T J Vinod, who attended the meeting, stressed the importance of rejuvenating the canals in the city.

Apart from the MP and MLAs, 60-odd councillors attended the meeting, which was organized to get feedback of people. Major emphasis was on the upkeep of canals once it is rejuvenated. Several councillors stressed the importance of evicting encroachments and checking waste dumping into the canals. “KMRL will compile the suggestions and include the select ones in the new DPR. KMRL will focus on rejuvenation of canals and will try to bring a vibrant civic life to the people of Kochi through the project.” said KMRL MD Alkesh Kumar Sharma.

Eden asked KMRL to foresee the chances of recurrence of flood while implementing the project. “Waterlogging is a major issue in Kochi. There should be a plan to address it. There should be a time frame for completing the project.” said the MP. He also asked KMRL to rehabilitate all the families, who would be evicted as part of the project. “A strategy should be developed for creating awareness among the public on the importance of keeping the canals clean and green,” he added.

Thomas spoke about the importance of cleaning the small tributaries leading to the main canals. He asked KMRL to frame policies in consultation with the government to monitor all the future construction activities along the banks of all these five canals. Vinod asked KMRL to explore the possibilities of rejuvenating more canals in the city. Swaraj, meanwhile, extended his support for the project and wished good luck for the project to make city beautiful.

48,['22/01/2020'],Price rise in 2-wheelers prompts customers to opt for financing,"File photo

CHENNAI: Auto financiers are expecting an increase in financing of two-wheelers because of a rise in prices and return of NBFCs to the market. According to a top Honda official, price increases in the last 9 months has already resulted in a 10% increase in financing of Honda scooters and motorcycles.“The financing penetration in two wheelers was impacted by the NBFC crisis but with that situation stabilizing Honda has seen 10% increase in financing in April-December period and from September onwards the financing percentage has been consistently 50% compared to the earlier average of 42-45%,” said Yadvinder Singh Guleria , senior VP, sales & marketing, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India.This however was backed by aggressive financing schemes. Financiers say there will be around Rs 8,000-Rs 10,000 price increase when the industry moves to BS6 on April 1. Honda, which has just rolled out its BS6 Activa scooter for instance, has priced it Rs 8,000 more than the BS4 version. This markup in turn will compel more customers to opt for financing.“There has been substantial cost escalation in the past 18 months and the BS6 transition will add to it. When ticket size goes up, customers prefer financing. Currently around 38%-40% of two wheelers are financed and we expect this to go up to around 55% due to price increases,” said Vyomesh Kapasi, MD, Kotak Mahindra Prime.Typically auto financiers see two wheelers as a high risk product because of low ticket size. “In the last 18 months, there have been 2-3 price hikes in two wheeler market which caused a mark up of 15%-20% and BS6 transition will add another 10%-12%. This pinch will lead customers who earlier bought with cash to shift to financing as they would now have to fort out an extra Rs 30,000 for the vehicle,” said Madhu Alexiouse, COO, Muthoot capital Services Current interest rates on two wheeler loans are around 18-20%, he added. The bad news is that the steep increase in prices will further impact sales. “While financing penetration will go up, demand will also come down unless financiers compromise on eligibility criteria. But two wheeler loans are still a high risk product and so will be priced higher,” said Ashok Khanna, group head-vehicle loans, HDFC Bank So how much will a Rs 8,000 BS6 mark up bite in terms of the EMI? Typically if the vehicle price goes up from Rs 63,000 to Rs 71,000 and the full amount is financed over a 3 year period on 18% interest, then the EMI will go up from around Rs 2,300 to Rs 4,300. The price hikes and sentiment downturn means there are fewer customers and the cash-paying customers are waiting it out.“Those taking financing are asking for longer tenures like three years and for the insurance amount to be built in to the loan,” said Khanna. As for the new electric two wheelers hitting the market, here the question mark is resale value. “We have no idea or experience about electric vehicles and we don’t know what the resale value would be,” said Khanna. “So for EV financing, the down payment is typically higher,” he added.",auto,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73529100,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1676616,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/bikes/price-rise-in-2-wheelers-prompts-customers-to-opt-for-financing/articleshow/73529122.cms

An Indian Rock Python injured by manja was operated at the Transit center

NAGPUR: Four years after the Transit Treatment Centre (TTC) was opened at Seminary Hills, the forest department has planned its expansion considering the increasing flow of animals.

“The centre will get a Rs60 lakh expanse, which includes procurement of necessary medical equipment and structural expansion by constructing an ICU, animal keeping area, cage keeping shed, stores, a conference and staff room and landscaping,” said Prabhunath Shukla , deputy conservator of forests (DyCF), Nagpur.

Shukla informed the centre is procuring auto haematoanalyzer, anaesthesia machine, X-calibber gauzed Co2 air rifle, microscope, carabiners for lifting heavy animals, complete set for rescuing animals, drone, mounting rope kit among other necessary gear.

Opened on December 23, 2015 amid reluctance by senior forest officials, who believed when a rescue centre was already in place at Gorewada, why a treatment centre was needed, today it is proving to be a boon for wild animals and hundreds of birds that are being brought for treatment by individuals and attending calls.

“Majority of the victims have been due to road accidents in the advent of large-scale widening in the entire region, besides electrocution and man-animal conflict. Apart from city, the centre has been getting calls from places within 100km radius,” says honorary wildlife warden Kundan Hate, who pushed for the need for such a centre.

One of the reasons for influx of patients can be attributed to growing awareness among people. “Even small injured birds like green bee-eaters are brought to the centre by young wildlife lovers,” Hate says.

“In the last two months, at least 50 birds injured after getting entangled in manja (kite thread) were brought to the centre. Of these, 35 were barn owls. Wings of a couple of birds have to be amputed, some have been released pot treatment while some are on verge of being freed,” says Dr Mayur Kate, a veterinary physician at TTC.

Kate adds, “It is not only the birds that are affected by manja, on Tuesday, we performed surgery on an Indian rock python rescued from Hazaripahad, which was severely injured after getting entangled in kite thread.”

“In the last 4 years, things at the centre have changed. There have been multiple cages now and a Rs25 lakh X-ray machine is in place. There was time when our staff used their own two-wheelers to attend calls and brought animals in gunny bags,” recalled RFO GN Jadhav.

The treatment centre has become a learning ground for PG students. They have been assisting the vets here or rather learning several processes involved informed Khushboo Ade, Vrushali Jadhav and Ashish Ransinga , who are pursuing their post-graduation in surgery.

50,['22/01/2020'],Experts for preserving Bihar’s cultural heritage,"This story is from January 22, 2020

PATNA: Historians and archaeologists from different parts of the country on Tuesday talked about the need to preserve Bihar’s rich cultural heritage and make the youths aware of the state’s glorious traditions.

Addressing a national seminar on ‘Relevance of Ancient History, Culture and Archaeology of Bihar’ organized by the department of ancient Indian history and archaeology in Patna University (PU), the experts also highlighted the importance of carrying out more intensive studies on ancient scripts and dialects of the state.

Delivering the keynote address, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) director (eastern region) P K Mishra said, “Well-documented technical reports should be submitted after the excavations for preservation of archaeological findings. However, due to the lack of manpower, technical reports are not being submitted, causing great loss to the archaeologists’ efforts.”

Mishra, who has done extensive excavations of sites in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, pleaded for a comparative study of the ancient archaeological findings and present day works. He said, “The archaeological findings should be showcased and initiatives taken to market them properly.”

Throwing light on the state, Veer Kunwar Singh University vice-chancellor (VC) D P Tiwary recalled the contributions of A S Altekar in excavating various archaeological sites in Bihar. He called upon the younger generation to take interest in studying their rich cultural heritage.

ASI joint director general Sanjay Kumar Manzul, who is an alumnus of PU, observed that Bihar had always been on the forefront of India’s art and culture and all efforts should be made to preserve and promote its rich cultural traditions.

PU VC Rash Bihari Prasad Singh, in his presidential remarks, said, “PU departments of ancient Indian history and archaeology, anthropology, geography and geology should join hands in carrying out detailed studies on the archaeological problems of the state and help excavate all the potential sites for discovering the past.”

Department head and seminar chairman Jayadeo Mishra highlighted the contributions of Altekar and B P Sinha in excavating Vikramshila and other archaeological sites. He pointed out that after India’s independence, the first archaeological report was submitted in 1950 and that was on archaeological excavations in Vaishali.

The seminar’s organizing secretary Md Sayeed Alam proposed the vote of thanks.

PWC: Patna Women’s College student, Soumya Shree, took charge as the new ‘premier’ of the students’ council during an oath-taking ceremony on Tuesday. Altogether 12 new members lit up candles and vowed to remain loyal to the college and uphold its status. The oath was administered by principal, Sr M Rashmi AC, who later gave away badges and sashes to the girls.

The college choir sang the national anthem and a welcome song. Outgoing ‘premier’, Yashwe, delivered a speech and encouraged the new members to work hard to maintain the college’s dignity.

Mementos and certificates were given to the outgoing members.

St Xavier’s college: Students of the mass communication department bagged the first prize in an inter-departmental competition organized at of St Xavier’s College of Management and Technology on Tuesday. BBA and BBE students stood second and third, respectively.

Altogether five teams participated in the event whose theme was ‘Gandhi’s India: Respect and Welfare for All’.

Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma and BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh will also be present at the rally where 20,000 to 30,000 people are expected to be in attendance.The party’s district committee, however, is hopeful that over 1 lakh people will attend the rally.

The local traffic department has issued an advisory putting in place alternate routes for trucks and buses coming from Delhi and Ghaziabad and entering the city from Partapur area. They will be diverted to Begumpul via Partapur bypass to avoid heavy traffic snarls on the Partapur stretch, which will see heavy vehicular traffic due to the rally.

Union Home minister Amit Shah was in Lucknow on Tuesday. In a rally, he clarified that there is no provision in the amended law for taking anyone's citizenship away and the law will not be withdrawn despite protests. “A canard is being spread against the CAA by the Congress, SP, BSP, and Trinamool Congress,” he said.

52,['22/01/2020'],Two charred to death as fire breaks out in Vaishali shop,"This story is from January 22, 2020

PATNA: Two persons were charred to death after a major fire broke out in a cloth shop near Botla Chowk under Mahua police station in Vaishali district early Tuesday morning.

Police said the incident took place around 4am when the victims, identified as Manjeet Kumar (25) and Bharat Sah (52), were asleep in the shop named Maa Durga Vastralaya on Hajipur-Mahua road.

Mahua sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Nurul Haq said while Manjeet was an employee at the shop, Bharat worked in a nearby tea stall. “Both were asleep when the fire engulfed the shop causing severe burn injuries. They died on the spot,” he said, adding that the victims were residents of Rajapakar and Kanhauli areas of the district.

Electric short-circuit is suspected to have caused the fire. “As the iron gate of the shop was closed from inside, it took much time to break it open. By the time rescuers entered the shop, the two victims had already succumbed to their burn injuries,” the SDPO said.

Altogether five fire tenders were pressed into service to douse the flames. Senior police and administrative officers later rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation. A complaint was also lodged with Mahua police station in this connection.

Mahua police station SHO Krishna Nand Jha said, “The exact cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. But prima facie it appears that short-circuit is suspected to have caused the fire. A case of unnatural death has been lodged.”

The SHO said the shop belonged to one Pramod Sah, who was away at his native village at the time of the incident. He reached the shop after being informed about the incident. “How the incident happened is subject to investigation,” the shopowner told the media.

A local trader, Sunil Kumar, said timely arrival of the fire tenders from the sub-divisional headquarters at Mahua averted a major tragedy. “Had the fire tenders not reached the spot, the fire would have engulfed some other shops located in the market,” he added.

54,['22/01/2020'],Karvy sets deadline of Feb 15 to pay clients’ dues,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Mumbai: Troubled Karvy Stock Broking has set a February 15 deadline to pay all its dues to clients, which includes stocks and funds worth several crores of rupees. With a new man at the helm, the brokerage house is also going in for a restructuring of its financial services business and there are rumours that this may include sale of some assets and subsidiaries.

In the last few days, Karvy Group chairman C Parthasarathy has written to some of the clients — who are waiting to get money and/or stocks from the broking house — that all their claims will be settled by February 15. On the other hand, some other investors, also awaiting funds and securities for months, have been told by the company’s staff that their claims will be settled by February 6.

To a query from TOI, a spokesperson for the broking house said that it was “arranging the necessary funds” and “plans to complete customer payouts in the next few weeks”. Karvy is also in the process of restructuring its financial services business and “will ensure all commitments are fulfilled”.

Last November, Sebi had passed an ex-parte order against Karvy Stock Broking taking on new customers after illegally using its clients’ stocks to pledge with banks to get money, and then funnelling that money into its other group companies. Subsequently, NSE and BSE had banned the stock broker from the markets.Some of Karvy’s large investors who are still stuck for funds and securities, however, believe that meeting the February 15 deadline could be difficult, given the current market situation. Also, they pointed out that over the last several months, Karvy has been promising payouts to its clients but has been deferring the same. On the positive side, some clients have been receiving stocks in their accounts as full or partial settlement of their dues from the Hyderabad-based broking house.

Referring to cybercrime , the DGP said it has become a big challenge and ‘cyber cell’ has been formed in every district. Cyber technology experts have been posted in every district to tackle such crime, he said and added that the districts will be connected with the criminal tracking network system (CCTNS) soon.

NEW DELHI: AAP on Tuesday fielded Preeti Tomar from Tri Nagar assembly constituency. She replaces her husband, former minister Jitender Singh Tomar , who was earlier nominated by the party, but whose candidature was dropped in the wake of Delhi high court setting aside his election for giving a false declaration on educational qualification in the 2015 assembly polls.

“I have not been barred from contesting the election. I have represented the seat and, now, my wife will do so. We will continue to work for the people. The party has agreed to the decision,” Tomar said.

An FIR was registered against him at Hauz Khas police station. On July 24, he was granted conditional bail with a direction to join the police investigation.

Representative image

PATNA: People in the state should brace up to pay more for a bread packet as the manufacturers have decided to increase the prices by Rs3 to Rs10 from January 26.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the Bihar Bakery Association here on Monday. Altogether 13 bread manufacturing units participated in the meeting. The rising prices of maida (wheat flour), sugar and groundnut refined oil are the main reasons behind the increase in prices.

According to officials of the association, prices of white sandwich bread, brown bread, pav and fruit-mixed bread would be increased substantially whereas the prices of bun and multi-grain breads would remain the same.

Bihar Bakery Association president NK Agarwal said the manufacturing units in the state have been raising concern over the rising prices of materials needed for bread. “Prices of sugar and refined oil have increased up to 20% in the last couple of months while maida prices increased from Rs19/kg to Rs25/kg in the last three years. But we did not increase a single penny during this period,” he told this newspaper on Tuesday.

“Several small manufacturing units were shut down in Bihar in the last three years due to increasing material cost whereas labourers demand at least 10% hike every year,” he added.

He said a 200 gram packet of white sandwich bread will cost Rs15 instead of Rs12, while the price of 400g will be Rs30, which is Rs5 more than the present rate. Similarly, a packet of 800g bread will cost Rs50, instead of Rs40. A brown bread packet of 400 gram and a pav packet will be dearer by Rs5. One will have to pay Rs18 for a fruit-mixed bread, which is Rs3 more than the existing price of Rs15.

According to Agarwal, there are total 20 big bread manufacturing units. “More than 1 lakh packets of bread are sold in the state every day,” he said.

Several sweetmeat shops, local shops, thelas and hotels would also increase the rates of veg and non-veg sandwiches, pav-bhajji and other food products.

PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Tuesday asked the health department officials to take necessary steps to ensure that maximum people avail the benefits under the Centre-sponsored Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (ABPMJAY).

Chairing a meeting here to review the performance of ABPMJAY, Nitish also asked the officials to expedite issuance of e-card to more people and tagging of more hospitals under the national medical insurance scheme so that maximum people are registered and avail the benefits. He said the health officials should hold talks with owners of private hospitals and make them partner under the scheme.

“You should also send some necessary suggestions to the Centre about the practical problems being faced in the implementation of the scheme,” Nitish advised officials.

A health coverage of Rs5 lakh per family per year is provided under the PM Narendra Modi’s dream project which was launched in Bihar by Nitish on September 23, 2018.

Earlier, state’s health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh, in a detailed presentation, informed the CM that total 1.08 crore families in Bihar have so far been registered under the scheme. These families are entitled to avail health coverage up to Rs5 lakh per annum.

“Till date, altogether 570 government hospitals and 194 private hospitals have been tagged under the scheme to provide health services to members of the beneficiary families,” Singh said, adding that the e-card for beneficiaries were being prepared at a fast pace.

Singh also provided detailed information on the number of district-wise tagged hospitals and services availed by the covered families.

Health department’s principal secretary Sanjay Kumar made a detailed presentation on the opening of ‘health and wellness centres’, the other aspect of the scheme. He stressed the need for creating a new ‘public health management cadre’ for strengthening health facilities in the government sector.

All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna

PATNA: Joint problems, especially of knee and hip, are on the rise in the state. Over 600 joint replacements have already been done at the department of orthopaedics of All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) in the last five years. These facts came to the fore at a continuing medical education (CME) programme organised by the orthopaedics department of AIIMS-P on Tuesday.

Dr Sudeep Kumar, associate professor of orthopaedics, AIIMS-P, said the main causes of rise in joint problems were lack of proper food rich with calcium, lifestyle and lack of exercise. “On an average, 10 patients turn up at the outpatient department of the hospital every day and most of the 600 patients who underwent joint replacement were from the state,” he said.

“Knee problems are common in elderly people and if diagnosed early, these can be treated with medicines and exercise. However, in case of these problems reaching advance stage, joint replacement is the only way. Apart from knee replacement, about 300 arthroscopic surgeries to treat ligament tearing were also performed at the hospital in the last five years,” Dr Sudeep added.

Dr Gautam Chakraborty of Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, United Kingdom, said knee or hip replacements should be undertaken only by specialised hospitals. He appreciated the knee surgeries performed at AIIMS-P.

Dr Anup Kumar, Dr Prabhat Agrawal, Dr Avinash Kumar and others joined the CME programme which was earlier inaugurated by AIIMS-P director Dr P K Singh.

61,['22/01/2020'],U’khand comes up with policy for leasing out agri land,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Dehradun: The Uttarakhand government has issued a notification for the policy to lease out agricultural land in the state for a period of 30 years.

Keeping in mind the tough terrain, migration and large expanse of barren land, the state cabinet had earlier approved the amendments to the Uttarakhand (Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition Land Reforms Act, 1950). After approval from the assembly and governor it was recently notified by the government.

As per its provisions, a farmer can lease out land for farming, agriculture, horticulture, herbs, off-season vegetables, dairy purpose and solar energy to an individual, firm or NGO for a period of 30 years. In return, the farmer would be provided rent by the person taking the land on lease.

After permission from the district magistrate, a government land around the firm can be leased out by paying the fee, but only under special circumstances.

State agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal told TOI, “Earlier, before leasing any land, a person or a farmer was afraid that the lease holder may stake ownership of a land. Now, we have made provisions under which a lease holder will not become owner of the land.”

He added that the decision will help the people, who had barren lands or were unable to farm due to some problem or the other. “In this way, not only farmers but also the economy will boost. There are many villages where people have migrated leaving behind barren land. If they are willing to lease it out, investors can work on them and in the long run, all stakeholders will be benefitted,” the minister added.

Kolhapur: Shiv Sena Member of Parliament Sanjay Mandlik on Tuesday announced that the Congress-NCP-Shiv Sena alliance, Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), will fight the upcoming elections in Kolhapur District Milk Producers Association, also known as Gokul dairy.

The dairy is considered as a medium to reach out to the farmers that are potential voters for general elections. Therefore, many are eyeing to gain power in the dairy. Currently, the faction led by Mahadevrao Mahadik and PN Patil is in power.

“For the first time we are contesting as MVA in Gokul dairy. We have highest number of members behind us as the farmers want change. They want increase in rates of milk procured from them by the dairy. Last time, some NCP leaders were not with us, however this time we are together.”

During the last election NCP MLA Hasan Mushrif had worked against the faction led by Congress leader Satej Patil and Mandlik.

Mandlik along with Congress MLA Ruturaj Patil and district NCP submitted the resolutions from local co-operative societies supporting them. They claimed that Shiv Sena alone has received 720 resolutions. The Congress and NCP claimed that they have support of 2,200 societies. The number of societies officially recorded for voting are 3,659.

Mandlik added that there is no formal proposal from Congress MLA PN Patil to hold the election unopposed. “We are firm to contest the election. There is no formal proposal. Contesting the election will only help to democratize the institute,” he said.

According to sources, the issue of multi-state, alleged irregularities in the dairy and low procurement rates for milk will be the major issues to be discussed during the election campaign.

A senior official from the department of co-operative societies claimed there is duplication of many of the resolutions submitted by the local societies.

“We have found that many societies have provided their resolution of support to both sides. We are going to scrutinise them after the deadline of submitting the resolution ends on Wednesday. The final voters list will be released in the first week of next month,” the official said.

Lectures on the issue by UGC chairman Sukhadeo Thorat and journalist-turned-politician Kumar Ketkar were also ... Read More

Nagpur: After heavy Sangh Parivar bashing during earlier rallies against NRC-CAA, nine-year-old Binish Shaikh was seen reciting lines “Krishna Tumhe Aana Hee Hoga” at the ongoing Eidgah grounds women protest in Jaffar Nagar on Tuesday.

The hymn is an SOS to Lord Krishna seeking his help in the struggle that has seen mostly Muslim participation till now. Binish was among the children who addressed the over 400 protesters gathered at the ground on the third day of the agitation held by Nagpur Peace Organisation. It will go on till January 29 in support of Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh women protesters.

Wearing a traditional scarf around her head, Binish read out from a note “Bharat Ke is Mahabharat main Krishna Tumhe Aana Hee Hoga, Sudarshan Chakra Haath main Leke Bhrasht Netaon Ko Narka Tak Pahuchana Hee Hoga”.

Lately, there have been efforts to include organizations’ of other communities like Marathas, OBCs, Dalits, tribals along with Sikhs and Christians in the protests. The leaders have been stressing that the law will not only affect Muslims but also others, especially the marginalized classes. Sessions sensitizing leaders of non-Muslim sects are also being held these days.

“There is indeed a need for Krishna to come down in the current circumstances of the country. When we were preparing for her speech we found this poem on the Internet,” said Binish’s mother Mehvash Shaikh. She said people were indeed relating the current crisis with the situation depicted in the poetry.

“The school in which my kids study has students from other faiths too. We believe in religious tolerance and respect towards other faiths. In fact, the lines were appreciated by others in the community too. We are all Indians irrespective of different faiths,” she said.

Amid the protests, lecture on the issue by former UGC chairman Sukhadeo Thorat and journalist-turned-politician Kumar Ketkar were held at Vasantrao Deshpande Hall. “The provisions of the CAA will invite blatant discrimination between various religions. It is unconstitutional and immoral,” said Thorat.

The talk ‘Truth behind the unconstitutional CAA, NRC and NPR’ was organized by the Federation of Organisation for Social Justice, Secularism and Democracy on Tuesday evening. Thorat said, “CAA aims to provide a healing touch to the persecuted communities except the Muslims in three Islamic countries. That kind of legislation is discriminatory in nature. The original 1955 Act is based on secular principles.”

Ketkar, who was the chief guest, said, “Because of CAA, tribal communities will be unfairly affected. These people live in forests where there are no municipalities or Zilla Parishads. They sometimes don’t have religions and sometimes are not even aware of it. How will government implement NRC? We already have Aadhaar cards. Why is there a need for NPR?” He said that the main object of CAA, NRC and NPR was to divide religions.

64,['22/01/2020'],US firm to hire 200 employees,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: California-based IT firm Way.com has begun its operations at Phase I Campus of Technopark this month with over 50 employees. Way.com founder and CEO Binu Girija said the company will hire 200 employees by year-end.

Way.com is a prominent services market place offering convenient ways to book parking space, dining, events etc. After operating in various centres such as Ahmedabad, Chennai and Pune, the company has set up its office at Technopark to start its consolidated operations here.

Binu, who is from Vilakkumadam near Anchal, said he has aligned his personal and business goals and that he wanted to bring more jobs to the city. “I was the 10th employee of UST Global at Technopark. I grew up here in Thiruvananthapuram. So, I wanted to add value to Technopark,” he said.

After learning from his unsuccessful attempts in setting up startups, Binu tasted success with Way.com in 2014-15. “Once, I had to park my car and go for an urgent meeting. When I came back, they charged me $39. Later, I saw that there was a parking lot for $12 nearby. I felt cheated. I set up Way.com for solving parking issues through a transparent platform,” he said. Venture capital firm Agnus Capital is one of the major investors in Way.com.

For its Technopark centre, Way.com is hiring employees from various domains such as digital marketing, content writing, product management, business development, finance, etc, apart from engineering. “The mission is to build complete back-office operations in Thiruvananthapuram,” Binu said.

Binu said it was important to stay updated with latest technology trends, or else, it would be difficult to get employment.

He said earlier, employees looked for bigger brand names, but salary has turned out to be a major factor now. “Still, employee stock option is a grey area in India. Employees are not aware of it. In Silicon Valley, non-Indian professionals prefer startups. As soon as a startup sells or goes for an IPO, thousand millionaires are created in the Valley,” Binu said.

65,['22/01/2020'],NSE beats CME to be world’s top F&amp;O bourse,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Mumbai: The National Stock Exchange ( NSE ), the country’s largest bourse in terms of both turnover and volumes, has overtaken the US-based Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) group to emerge as the world’s largest derivatives exchange by number of contracts traded.

In 2019, nearly 6 billion derivatives contracts were traded on the NSE, compared to 4.8 billion on CME, data from Futures Industry Association (FIA), a global derivatives trade body, showed. The other three in the top five list are B3 of Brazil, Intercontinental Exchange of the US and the Eurex Group, headquartered in Germany.

NSE allows derivatives trading in equities, commodities, currency and interest rate. In comparison, CME allows derivatives trading in equities, commodities, interest rates, currency, weather, real estate, over-the-counter (OTC) products, etc.

The jump in the number of derivatives contracts traded on NSE came on the back of deepening of equity markets in India, a release by the exchange noted. “NSE witnessed more than 1.2 crore new investor registrations in the cash equities segment in the last five years, out of which close to 87 lakh registrations were in the last three years. It is also observed that a third of the new investors have come from tier-3 and tier-4 cities,” it noted. “Another heartening feature is adoption of digital tools by investors with about 26% of total trading activity in the cash equities segment coming through mobile and internet trading.”

NSE is also ranked third in the world in the cash-trading segment by number of trades, data from World Federation of Exchanges showed.

Commenting on the development, NSE MD & CEO Vikram Limaye said this was possible due to “supportive government and regulatory policies, state of the art technology infrastructure, a robust risk-management framework and broad-based trust and participation by the entire spectrum of global and domestic investors”.

PATNA: Anti-trafficking awareness drive is the need of the hour to make adolescents aware about its dangers, ADG (CID) Vinay Kumar said on Tuesday.

Addressing a workshop on ‘Anti-trafficking’ jointly organized by US consulate, Kolkata and Shakti Vahini here, Vinay said all the groups and organizations working against human trafficking should educate and empower kids to prevent such crime.

“Convergence and coordination between civil society, government agencies, states and multiple stakeholders across the country is important for combating human trafficking at grassroots level. It can also prevent the exploitation of the victims and protect them from trafficking,” the ADG said.

IG (Prisons & Correctional Services) Mithilesh Mishra stressed on the need for the law enforcement agencies and child protection committees to work with focused approach. “They have to make a plan and set the target for the better results in anti-trafficking drive,” he said.

Deputy director of American Center (Kolkata), Krish Das, said, “The US consulate general, Kolkata, is committed to intensifying our efforts to end human trafficking through a year-round, multilateral approach that supports the coordination of anti-trafficking efforts through meaningful engagement with local governments, law enforcement agencies, judiciary, civil society, the private sector and trafficking survivors.”

Shakti Vahini founder Ravi Kant said, “Human trafficking is an organized crime and over the years it has grown in dimensions. The missing children data as reported by the National Crime Records Bureau is an indicator of the magnitude of the problem. Around 46,000 adolescents, including 30,000 girls, are missing in the country since 2018.”

The experts talked about the various aspects of anti-trafficking in four technical sessions.

In first session, ex-chairperson of State Child Protection Society Bihar, Nisha Jha, and Chanakya National Law University dean SP Singh talked about ‘Creating safe communities and child protection’, whereas Ravi spoke on ‘Online child sexual abuse and online child sexual exploitation and safety mechanisms’. Vanessa Bouche, professor at Texas Christian University, US, chaired the sessions on ‘Diverge for co-creation — group work’ and ‘Finalization of action plan with: Creating strategies for synergy and results’.

KOLHAPUR: Bad weather resulted in cancellation of Kolhapur-Tirupati flight on Tuesday following which enraged passengers roughed up the private airline staff.

Indigo provides air service from Kolhapur to Hyderabad, Hyderabad to Kolhapur and Kolhapur to Tirupati. Every day the flight from Hyderabad reaches Kolhapur at around 10.30 am and the same flight takes passengers from Kolhapur to Tirupati at 10.50 am.

The flight that was supposed to reach Kolhapur at 10.30 am got cancelled due to low visibility at Kolhapur airport. Thus, the officials from Kolhapur airport announced that they are unable to take passengers from Kolhapur to Tirupati.

Passengers after hearing the announcement rushed to the airline staff and took them to task. The issue was resolved after the airlines arranged a private bus for the passengers from Kolhapur to Belagavi and booked their tickets from Belagavi to Tirupati.

Kolhapur airport director Kamal Katariya said, “There are several reasons like bad visibility and technical glitches due to which flights get cancelled. The airlines make alternate arrangements for passengers to avoid inconvenience. We always give priority to safety and service to the passengers. We also expect cooperation from passengers at such situations.”

70,['22/01/2020'],Price rise in 2-wheelers prompts customers to opt for financing,"This story is from January 22, 2020

File photo

CHENNAI: Auto financiers are expecting an increase in financing of two-wheelers because of a rise in prices and return of NBFCs to the market. According to a top Honda official, price increases in the last 9 months has already resulted in a 10% increase in financing of Honda scooters and motorcycles.

“The financing penetration in two wheelers was impacted by the NBFC crisis but with that situation stabilizing Honda has seen 10% increase in financing in April-December period and from September onwards the financing percentage has been consistently 50% compared to the earlier average of 42-45%,” said Yadvinder Singh Guleria , senior VP, sales & marketing, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India.

This however was backed by aggressive financing schemes. Financiers say there will be around Rs 8,000-Rs 10,000 price increase when the industry moves to BS6 on April 1. Honda, which has just rolled out its BS6 Activa scooter for instance, has priced it Rs 8,000 more than the BS4 version. This markup in turn will compel more customers to opt for financing.

“There has been substantial cost escalation in the past 18 months and the BS6 transition will add to it. When ticket size goes up, customers prefer financing. Currently around 38%-40% of two wheelers are financed and we expect this to go up to around 55% due to price increases,” said Vyomesh Kapasi, MD, Kotak Mahindra Prime.

Typically auto financiers see two wheelers as a high risk product because of low ticket size. “In the last 18 months, there have been 2-3 price hikes in two wheeler market which caused a mark up of 15%-20% and BS6 transition will add another 10%-12%. This pinch will lead customers who earlier bought with cash to shift to financing as they would now have to fort out an extra Rs 30,000 for the vehicle,” said Madhu Alexiouse, COO, Muthoot capital Services .

Current interest rates on two wheeler loans are around 18-20%, he added. The bad news is that the steep increase in prices will further impact sales. “While financing penetration will go up, demand will also come down unless financiers compromise on eligibility criteria. But two wheeler loans are still a high risk product and so will be priced higher,” said Ashok Khanna, group head-vehicle loans, HDFC Bank .

So how much will a Rs 8,000 BS6 mark up bite in terms of the EMI? Typically if the vehicle price goes up from Rs 63,000 to Rs 71,000 and the full amount is financed over a 3 year period on 18% interest, then the EMI will go up from around Rs 2,300 to Rs 4,300. The price hikes and sentiment downturn means there are fewer customers and the cash-paying customers are waiting it out.

“Those taking financing are asking for longer tenures like three years and for the insurance amount to be built in to the loan,” said Khanna. As for the new electric two wheelers hitting the market, here the question mark is resale value. “We have no idea or experience about electric vehicles and we don’t know what the resale value would be,” said Khanna. “So for EV financing, the down payment is typically higher,” he added.

PATNA: A team of Chhattisgarh police, which camped in Bihar for five days, failed to rescue industrialist Praveen Somani, who was kidnapped for a ransom of Rs 6.5 crore from Raipur district on January 8. The team, led by Raipur SSP Sheikh Arif Hussain, has now shifted its focus to some districts in Uttar Pradesh which share border with Bihar.

Police sources said at least two interstate criminal gangs with roots in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were involved in Somani’s kidnapping.

According to police sources, notorious Chandan Sonar is suspected to be mastermind behind Somani’s kidnapping. It was Sonar who had kidnapped Gujarat-based garment industrialist Sohail Hingora from Daman in October 2013 and kept him captive in Bihar’s Saran until around Rs 10 crore was paid to him as ransom.

Somani owns iron and steel manufacturing units in Chhattisgarh’s Raipur district. Sources said the industrialist was brought to Jamshedpur from where he was shifted to Ranchi and then to Gaya.

“Chattishgarh police team has so far conducted raids in Patna, Nalanda and Vaishali districts and quizzed several suspects having links with Sonar,” sources said.

Bihar STF SP Sudhir Kumar Podika refused to divulge details of the operation, saying it would hamper investigations. He, however, said the Chattisgarh police team has shifted its focus from Bihar to Uttar Pradesh now.

73,['22/01/2020'],State pollution control board serves notice to Shishambara plant operator for flouting environment norms,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Haridwar: The operators of Shishambara plant were served notice by the state pollution control board (SPCB) for flouting environmental laws on Monday. The notice states that if they don’t respond to it within 15 days, legal and administrative action will be initiated against them.

The move comes after a SPCB team recently conducted an inspection of the solid waste management plant. During inspection, the team found that around 20,000 metric tonnes of solid waste was not disposed in accordance with the rules laid down in the Environment Act. The team also concluded that some of the equipment were not good enough to be used in a solid waste management plant.

SPCB findings revealed that Leachate Treatment Plant remained shut for 15 days and unchecked leachate (liquid that passes through a landfill and has extracted dissolved and suspended matter from it) flows in the waste plant premises triggering unbearable stench. This leachate also flows into the nearby river and contaminates its waters. The inspection also found that air and water quality near the plant is unsatisfactory.

Meanwhile, locals who live near the plant have also been protesting against the plant operators for violating environmental norms. On Monday, a two-hour-long protest was staged at the Nehru Colony-based SPCB office.

Locals say that the state government has allowed dumping of city waste in the rural belt neglecting the fact that it is catastrophic for the forest and river. “The plant operators flout norms but they still receive Rs 92 lakh from local urban body. The civic body is clearing the city of waste at the expense of outskirt areas. Why is the pollution control board silent on this issue,” asks Ramni Devi, a resident of Singhniwala, located near the solid waste management plant.

SP Subudhi, member secretary of SPCB, told TOI, “The notice has been sent on the basis of the inspection conducted by our regional office team. We are awaiting their response. Further action will be decided on the basis of their response.” The response would determine penalty on the firm, the official added.

Last year, residents living near the Shishambara waste plant had handed over a memorandum addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind through the district administration in which they expressed deep anguish and said that they cannot see their children dying a slow death and therefore want voluntary death.

74,['22/01/2020'],No concession in property tax dues this time: KMC,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Tuesday announced that this time around there will be no concession or waiver on property tax dues.

The KMC has issued a public appeal stating that property tax defaulters should clear dues to avoid sealing of their properties. It also added that for the last three years the civic body has been giving concession to property tax defaulters.

“This time as well there is demand of concession on payment of dues. For the last three years concession was given and if allowed this year, the KMC may face strictures from the state auditors. There can be objections but it is unlikely that the state will allow it this time, considering the financial situation of the KMC. Therefore, defaulters should pay their dues to avoid the fine amount of 2% for every month and avoid sealing of the properties,” the appeal read.

The KMC is soon going to start sealing and confiscating the properties of the defaulters. Last year, the KMC had granted 50% concession on the penalty amount charged to the defaulters. Such decisions cause revenue loss to the civic body and last year the loss was around Rs 7 crore.

A senior property tax official said, “The elected representatives put pressure on us to grant concession. They come up with the proposal. However, we have asked the corporators to refrain from bringing in such proposals as it will be bad for the fiscal health of the KMC. Already recovery of the tax targets has slowed down. Concession makes defaulters pay the dues, however many times it leads to huge losses.”

The official claimed that the total amount of dues with the big defaulters has mounted to Rs 15 crore and the amount is part of the annual tax target. The corporators claim that fines act as deterrence to the defaulters to pay the tax on time and they eventually become the habitual defaulters.

75,['22/01/2020'],Jewellery imports drop in 6 of 9 mths of FY20,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Chennai: Poor domestic demand and falling exports has resulted in import of gems and jewellery in six out of nine months of FY20.

India imports gems and jewelery and value adds it and exports them.

Overall Indian imports of gems and jewellery declined 6.5% y-o-y to $18.6 billion (by value) for the period from April to December from $20 billion during the same period last year. August, September and November saw a growth in imports, while the rest of the months saw a fall, data from Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) showed.

Among categories, rough diamonds show the highest fall of 16%, while gold jewellery saw a 4% fall. Even as the category is small, rough coloured gemstones saw a fall of 36%, contributing to the fall.

Even as gold bars saw a growth of 5% mainly in November, overall imports were down. “Demand from China dropped by 10% because of the internal unrest and trade war, which is the second largest importer of our cut and polished diamonds,” said Colin Shah, vice chairman, GJEPC.

Mumbai: ICICI Lombard General Insurance has reported a net profit of Rs 294 crore for the quarter ended December 2019 an increase of 23% over Rs 239 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

The increase in premium was despite its gross premium remaining flat at Rs 3,769 crore largely due to the company’s decision to stay away from crop insurance. Crop insurance in the previous financial years had accounted for nearly a fifth of the company’s gross direct premium. Despite absence of crop and a flat gross premium the net premium rose 2% to Rs 2,657 crore on the back of higher retention. The company also reported an increase in investment income at Rs 336 crore from Rs 301 crore in the corresponding period last year.

Announcing the results, Bhargav Dasgupta, MD & CEO, said that the company’s combined ratio worsened to 100.5% in the first nine months of FY20 compared to 98.7% last year primarily on account of long-term motor policies and losses from catastrophic events in the previous quarters. The company was the fourth-largest non-life insurer in India based on gross direct premium income in fiscal 2019. The company had a sound capital position with a solvency ratio of 2.18 times the statutory requirement as on December 31, 2019 as against 2.26x at September 30, 2019.

Kanhaiya Kumar

GAYA: Former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar on Tuesday asked CM Nitish Kumar to call a special session of the legislature and pass a resolution against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on the line of Kerala or be ready to face public ire.

Addressing a public meeting at Gaya Gandhi Maidan, Kanhaiya exhorted Nitish to shed ambiguity and be counted among the saviours and not the saboteurs of the Constitution. He was in the town to attend the CPI’s state unit meeting. Kanhaiya said the CAA-NPR-NRC was not anti-Muslim but anti-poor as it will affect all the undocumented and ill documented people irrespective of religion, caste and creed. The status of documentation in our country is very poor and as such a very large number of people are vulnerable to losing their nationality, not because they are not Indians but because they cannot prove their citizenship status, he said.

The CPI leader also announced to undertake a ‘Samvidhan Yatra’ from Champaran to Patna on January 30, the day Mahatma Gandhi was martyred.

Ridiculing Union home minister Amit Shah’s reported claim of being a ‘bania’, Kanhaiya said the latter has brought discredit to the community respected all over the country for its computing skills.

Even the dullest of bania knows that 15 can never equal 85 and still he is trying to make 85 look weak in comparison to 15. He was referring to the ratio of non-Muslim and Muslim population in the country and the BJP’s attempt to play up the apprehensions of the majority community.

Cautioning those who were nursing the illusion that NRC would not affect them, Kanhaiya advised such people to visit Assam where 15 lakh of the 19 lakh stateless people were non-Muslims. He also asked people not to call UP CM as Yogi. Yogis denounce power, not usurp it, Kanhaiya said.

Earlier, trade union leader Amarjeet Kaur said that public sector undertakings, including BSNL, were bleeding white to make private players ‘obese’.

Later in the evening, Kanhaiya visited Shanti Bagh area of the town where the 24X7 anti-CAA protest entered the 24th day. Kanhaiya expressed solidarity with the protesting men, women and children and said their fight will not go in vain.

PATNA: Around 35,000 retail and 20,000 wholesale chemist shops across state would remain shut for three days from Wednesday against alleged harassment and exploitation by drug inspectors in the name of inspection.

The strike has been called under the aegis of Bihar Chemist and Druggist Association . Its president PK Singh told TOI on Tuesday that drugstores supplying emergency and life-saving drugs in government and private hospitals would remain open. Earlier, it was decided to close all drugstores. “The decision was changed after receiving requests from different sections of the society,” he said.

Singh alleged that several wholesalers were being threatened by health department authorities to keep their shops open during strike period or face action like licence cancellation. “We want to tell the authorities that if they pressurise us in such manner then the three-day strike would be extended for an indefinite period. Also, we will withdraw our decision to allow emergency and life-saving drug supplying shops inside hospitals to keep open,” he said.

The association’s president said their first demand from the state government is to provide a pharmacist to each retail shop or let them continue with the old system where one pharmacist used to handle at least ten drugstores given the huge scarcity of pharmacists in state.

“Our second demand is to withdraw departmental order dated March 29 last year in which guidelines for inspecting a shop were described. We demand that if licence is granted under Drugs and Cosmetics Act then inspection be also made according to the its guidelines,” he said.

Singh further said their third demand is that drugstore owners must be given at least one chance to rectify technical errors like difference in size of signboard during inspection by health department authorities instead of taking action like licence suspension.

Meanwhile, Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries came out in support of the association’s demand on Tuesday. It requested health minister Mangal Pandey and department’s principal secretary Sanjay Kumar for sympathetically considering their demands so that they withdraw their strike.

Chamber’s president PK Agrawal conveyed to the government that chemists and druggists are part of the society and they need to be supported.

PATNA: In a first, Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), Bihar on Tuesday blacklisted a city-based private firm for violating various norms of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, such as non-registration of ongoing project, duping the homebuyers and not giving them flats on time.

The order to blacklist the firm, Utkarsh Infra Construction Pvt Ltd at Kirorichak in Phulwarisharif, was issued by a RERA-Bihar bench of Rajiva Bhushan Sinha and Subodh Kumar Sinha.

The bench said the private firm has been prohibited from acting as a developer or real estate agent in the state with immediate effect. “This communication should also be sent to the RERAs of all the other states to impose similar bans on the company and their directors,” it said.

The bench further ordered that all bank accounts of the company should be frozen with immediate effect till its liabilities in the project, Kedar Palace, are fully discharged. “All the rights of the erring firm over Kedar Palace should be seized with immediate effect,” the bench said.

According to sources at RERA-Bihar, all the top officials of the firm were avoiding the buyers and authorities concerned. The buyers, who had booked flats offered by the company in 2016, had lodged several complaints against it with RERA-Bihar.

RERA-Bihar member R B Sinha told said they had issued several notices to the company directors and board members to appear before the bench, but to no avail. “We have already seized the company’s property, including Kedar Palace in Anisabad locality. The company had accepted money from 24 home-buyers for this project,” he said.

Sinha added, “Since the company directors are unavailable, we have decided to give the flats to the buyers by creating a home-buyer association. The building is almost complete and buyers can move to it.”

“The complainants who suffered mental and physical harassment may approach for compensation, if they wish so, under Section 71 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016,” the RERA bench stated in its judgement.

Nearly 1,500 elderly people gathered at Jantar Mantar on Tuesday asserting their right to universal monthly pe... Read More

NEW DELHI: 70-year-old Taj Begum , a resident of Old Seemapuri , is the primary breadwinner in her family. She lives with her widowed daughter-in-law, grandchildren and a son who is battling cancer. On Tuesday, she was at Jantar Mantar along with around 1,500 elderly people , asserting her right to universal monthly pension and streamlining of the process.

Taj Begum’s pension woes began soon after she lost her husband some 24 years ago. First, she could not get herself registered for widow pension as she temporarily misplaced her husband’s death certificate. Then, she was misguided by touts. A few years ago, when she finally got all her documents together and applied for an old-age pension, she was told that there was a cap on the number of pensions that could be given and was asked to apply for a widow pension.

In the run-up to Delhi elections, Taj Begum and others put up a show of solidarity and were brought together by Pension Parishad — a network of 200 organisations with a base in 20 states. It was highlighted that there was a 18.50-lakh strong voter base accounting for the elderly. In Delhi, elderly pension for those between 60 and 70 years is Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,500 for those above 70 years. The amount includes the central contribution of Rs 200 for those between 60 and 79 and Rs 500 for those above 80 years. At a press conference later, Pension Parishad released a report to cite how the Centre’s contribution under the Indira Gandhi Old Age Pension Scheme was last revised in 2007.

Activist Nikhil Dey from Pension Parishad told TOI that it was agreed that there was a need to organise the elderly at the community level so that they could collectively raise their concerns. Dey said the three major demands raised by the elderly included monthly pension of half the minimum wage to all the elderly; indexation of pension and a streamlined process of approving pensions.

When contacted on cap on old age pension, social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam told TOI that 5.30 lakh elderly were covered by pension in Delhi. “Since AAP came to power in 2015, around 1.50 lakh new pensions have been added. This includes 1 lakh pensions added by easing the cap and another 50,000 given to applicants after the earlier pensioner either died or the pension was cancelled. To add new pensions, the cap will have to be eased,” Gautam said. There is currently no cap on widow and disability pension and Gautam said he was all for exploring if the cap could be further eased and would work on this if AAP returned to power.

In a statement, the Pension Parishad demanded that Delhi government “determine a standard of basic entitlements that allows all people to live without deprivation. The entitlements should be delivered with minimum documentation, smoothly and efficiently, in a corruption-free manner”.

Bareilly: Fifteen-year-old Richa, a student of Class X, started complaining of stress and inability to recall lessons that she had memorised. Panicked, the girl was unable to memorise the concepts she had studied round the year. As the situation started getting worse, Richa’s parents took her to Mann Kaksh, a counselling centre at the district hospital, for the treatment of exam anxiety. After counselling and treatment, Richa felt improvement and scored well in her pre-board exams.

Richa, however, is not alone. With the board exams set to begin the next month, there is a surge in the number of students complaining of anxiety and stress, and as many as 15 students of Class X have been counselled for exam anxiety in just a fortnight.

Dr Ashish Kumar, a psychiatrist at the district hospital, said, “Due to awareness among parents, there is an increase in the number of students seeking the help of counsellors for stress management ahead of the exams.”

Khush Ada, a clinical psychologist at Mann Kaksh, said, “While counselling, we make students understand that though exam results are important, it will hardly decide their future. We help them regain their lost confidence and counsel them to work hard to achieve their goals with smart studies and recreational activity.”

“Parents approach us when their children complain of headache, nausea and stomach upset due to exam-related stress when their final exams approaching. Students are under pressure to fulfil the expectations of their parents, peers and teachers. We counsel them on stress management,” she added.

According to counsellors, students should avoid studying continuously for hours and should take breaks. They should take proper sleep of six to eight hours and have a proper diet.

Meanwhile, the district mental health unit is conducting counselling sessions on stress management in government schools. The counsellors have recently covered two schools and are set to organise camps in other schools later this month.

89,['22/01/2020'],"State BJP leadership to oppose three capitals plan, but Centre tight-lipped","This story is from January 22, 2020

Amaravati: The state unit of BJP is determined to oppose the government’s three-capital plan. Although the BJP has welcomed the government move to relocate the high court to Kurnool, the party said such decisions should not be taken in haste.

BJP state president Kanna Lakshminarayana said the party would chalk out a plan along with Jana Sena to protect the interests of Amaravati farmers.

Speaking to media in New Delhi on Tuesday, Kanna slammed the state government for taking unilateral decisions regarding the shifting of the capital city. He said people were feeling the pinch of the YSRC government’s policies. “Jaganmohan Reddy got an overwhelming majority in the assembly only due to peoples’ anger against the TDP government. It is now certain that Jaganmohan too would face similar anger in the next elections,” he said. Jaganmohan has been playing with the lives of the people for the past seven months as he was taking decisions out of vengeance against some sections, he said, adding that the BJP state leadership would not keep quite on such policies.

BJP national spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao, who was also present at the media conference, however, clarified that the Centre would not interfere in the decision taken by the state government at this juncture.

“TDP is demanding for the Centre’s interference like an elder brother. This is not a family dispute. We will go by the Constitution and the state government has absolute right to choose its capital city,” said GVL.

He said that the party’s state leadership was free to chalk out programmes if it found that the decisions of the state government were anti-people. Citing the situation in West Bengal, GVL said the Centre had not stepped in despite knowing that BJP activists were killed and tortured by the Mamata Banerjee government regularly.

He lashed out at Chandrababu Naidu for picking up Amaravati as capital city by ignoring the Prof Sivaramakrishanan committee report. He said Naidu was the first culprit for the chaotic situation in the state.

He said Jaganmohan has complicated the matter further by deciding to have three capitals. He said the YSRC government has retained Amaravati as the legislative capital city only to avoid legal complications. He, however, backed the state government’s decision to set up the high court in Kurnool.

90,['22/01/2020'],CBSE allows use of calculators for special students,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Nagpur: For the first time in its history, CBSE will allow the use of calculators starting this summer’s board exams for students with dyscalculia (difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetic). This facility can be availed only by those students who have already registered themselves under the “children with special needs” (CWSN) category for the exams. The board has specified that only a ‘simple basic calculator’ can be used.

But the facility to use calculator is not a default option for students with dyscalculia, rather they will have to apply for it specifically. By January 28, students will have to apply in writing to their principals following which the request has to be forwarded to the regional office (RO) concerned by February 2. The RO will then send a final approval to school/exam centre superintendent.

Principals say this is a welcome move by the board and will help students who have a disadvantage when it comes to numbers. Shilpee Ganguly, principal of Centre Point School (Katol Road), who also teaches physics in Std XII, said “I have always been a votary for use of calculators even for physics or chemistry because some of the ways we do our calculations are absolutely horrendous with no learning. Some of the calculations which they do in physics have no enrichment value.”

Anmol Badjatia, principal of Jain International School, said, “This is a fantastic move by CBSE because it will help students in learning more life skills. Students with dyscalculia do understand numbers, but struggle in operations. So if they can get some help in the operations part, it will mean a lot to them.”

Well known adolescent counsellor and paediatrician Dr Rajiv Mohta said, “This will be a big help for students with dyscalculia. They get confused with numbers and having a calculator will at least make it a level playing field.”

Maharashtra state board, as of now, only provides other exemptions to students with dyscalculia. Ravikant Deshpande, Nagpur division chairman for the state board, said, “No calculators are allowed but we give them extra time to complete the paper.”

CISCE board, popularly known by its Std X certificate name ICSE, offers the most options for students with dyscalculia. Raziya Hussain, principal of MSB Institute, said, “Apart from the use of calculators for students suffering from dyscalculia, our board even allows them to drop math even in Std X. There is no point in a student struggling with math, when they could choose something like environmental science etc,” said Hussain.

Bareilly: The basic education department has decided to cut one-day salary of all those government primary school teachers who on Tuesday boycotted teaching to stage a protest, pressing the government to accept their various demands.

The protesting teachers, however, claimed that they were on a day's mass casual leave to participate in the protest, even as the department had directed them in advance “not to go on a collective leave”.

The Bareilly unit of the Uttar Pradeshiye Prathamik Shikshak Sangh staged a protest at the office of district inspector of school (DIOS). The protesting teachers handed over a memorandum of their demands to the DIOS to be submitted to chief minister Yogi Adityanath.

As scores of teachers participated in the protest — part of a ‘Shikshak Samman Bachao’ campaign being run by the teachers’ association across the state — teaching in schools suffered.

Basic shiksha adhikari (BSA) Tanuja Tripathi said, “All schools in Bareilly district were opened on Tuesday. I have sought reports on absentee teachers and their one-day salary will be deducted.”

Though scores of teachers joined the protest in Bareilly, their numbers were not compiled till filing of this report.

Harish Babu Sharma, a protesting teacher, said, “A teacher is entitled to 14 casual leaves in a year, and it is his right to use all his leaves. On a call given by our organisation, teachers from across the state applied for a day’s casual leave for a sit-in to press for our demands. The teachers had informed the department in writing about it a few days ago.”

In the memorandum, the protesters alleged that eligible teachers were not being promoted for the past three years after the department shelved the post of headteachers in primary and upper primary schools.

They also questioned the transfer policy adopted by the department. Other major demands of teachers included availability of furniture, power supply with fans and proper lighting facility, drinking water, boundary walls and deployment of Grade IV employees or sanitation staff in the schools.

They also demanded regular jobs for Shiksha Mitras, implementation of the old pension scheme and rollback of Prerna app on which teachers need to post their selfies taken at their schools.

Despite the contributions for the country, the Anglo-Indian community feels sidelined as their reservations an... Read More

CHENNAI: They’ve contributed a great deal to India – in education (establishing more than 300 institutions in the country, 40 in TN, as well as setting up boards of education); in the defence of the nation (more than 8,000 fought in World War 1, in the 1965 war with Pakistan, Brig Desmond Hayde was the architect of the victory at Dogra, the turning point in the war); and in government service (a force to reckon with in the railways, posts and telegraphs).

But the Anglo-Indian community has also lost a great deal in the 70 years since Independence — from reservation in jobs and colleges to rights in terms of a board of education. ""We’ve come to terms with being sidelined, but now, we’re on the verge of being forgotten, losing what little representation we have in the government. And that is a frightening place to be,"" says Augustine Roy Rozario, founder and president, Anglo-Indian Suburban Front.

Rosario is referring to the Union cabinet’s recent decision to discontinue Constitutional provisions guaranteeing reservation for Anglo-Indians in the Lok Sabha, a privilege obtained for the community by lawyer and fellow community member Frank Anthony, who was a member of the Constituent Assembly and a nominated MP for four decades. It is the only Indian community that has representatives, two MPs, nominated to the Lok Sabha; 14 states have a single nominated Anglo-Indian member each in their respective state assemblies.

""Community members are scattered all over India,"" says Beatrix D’Souza, the first woman to represent the community in Parliament. ""We do not have our own state, and therefore in an electoral democracy we cannot be adequately represented unless we have our nominated seats in Parliament,"" says D’Souza.

It is estimated that more than a third of Anglo-Indians have left the country since 1947. The numbers still in India — depending on who is counting — vary from 296 (as per the 2011 census) and 4 lakh (according to Dr Nancy Ann Cynthia Francis, member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly; 1.5 lakh still in south India).

Dr Francis says the community has been steadily losing benefits. In 1950, for instance, there was 5% reservation for them in the railways, but with the condition that they would lose their reservation at the rate of 0.5 a year for the next 10 years. By 1960, there was no more reservation, which Rosario says is the reason, fewer community members are now in public service dwindled. ""We had reservation in colleges too,"" says Francis, among the last to avail the reserved medical seat in 1972. ""The Anglo-Indian syllabus too was integrated into the state syllabus 10 years ago."" Members of the community also feel the draft National Education Policy seeks to curb the rights of the community by bringing all schools across the country under one board, thereby undermining their rights in the field of education.

Over the years, nominated representatives have been petitioning for housing estates, cultural centres and reserved places for Anglo-Indians in Indian universities. In 2013, the Union minority ministry released a report that stated the community was in a crisis of identity, lack of proper education, employment, and cultural erosion. The 2019 decision, says Rosario, will worsen the situation. ""There are skill training centres and housing for poor members of the community in the pipeline. This move will halt development plans,"" says Rosario.

If our nomination is taken away, says D’Souza, any sort of development of the community will cease. ""We will not be able to avail the funds that MPs MLAs can use for development, which now amounts to `5 crore a year."" D’Souza says in her time it was `2 crore a year, with which she funded the building of schools, old age homes and a community halls.

The new move has now brought the members of the community under one umbrella of protest. A group in Chennai staged a protest last week. A few days before that, representatives of 10 Anglo-Indian associations from across the country along with the present and past nominated MPs and MLAs, and heads of Anglo-Indian schools met in Kolkata to form committees to conduct state and nation-wide protests, along with a delegation to meet the President. ""Our slogan is ‘together we can’. This is the first time the community is banding together like this. We can no longer remain silent,"" says Rosario.

KOLHAPUR: The Ichakaranji police on Monday arrested and booked a Telnade gang member Pawan Upadhye under MCOCA in connection with various criminal cases including extortion and rape.

However, the main accused Telnade brothers are still absconding and police are still searching for their whereabouts.

Upadhye was produced before a local court and court sent to police custody till January 23. “Telnade brothers, Upadhye and others were booked for allegedly threatening a woman, raping had stolen gold jewellery from her. The case was registered with the Gavbhag police station four months ago. Upadhye had applied for pre-arrest bail against his arrest in district court which was rejected. He had again applied in High Court but withdrew his application and surrendered before the police on Monday,” said a police officer from Ichalkaranji.

Kolhapur police in September 2019 booked the notorious ‘ST-Sarkar’ gang run by the Telnade brothers under MCOCA for the second time. The police had booked the gang members after they were alleged involvement in the murder of Bharat Tyagi in 2013.

“We are searching for the whereabouts of Telnade brothers that are absconding from Ichalkaranji. We have also initiated the process to cancel the post of corporator of Sanjay Telnade and the district collectorate will soon take a decision on his candidature. We have also initiated action to seize the property of the duo and other members of the gang and have appointed a forensic auditor for the same purpose. The details of the properties assessed by the auditor will be submitted in the court and based on it we will initiate the process to seize the property of the gang members. The properties of the relatives of the gang members are also on the radar,” he said.

Police took action against the gang following the incident in which they attacked an industrialist based in Ichalkaranji in July 2019.

Visakhapatnam: The area under the jurisdiction of the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) is likely to increase following proposals sent by VMRDA officials to the government to include another 13 mandals in the district under its ambit. An official order on the merger of these mandals is expected within the next few weeks.

Visakhapatnam district consist of 43 mandals, of which 19 are currently part of the VMRDA. Excluding area under the Intergrated Tribal Development Agency ( ITDA ), which comprises 11 mandals, all other mandals in the district will fall under the development authority following the merger.

Speaking to TOI, VMRDA chairman Dronamraju Srinivasa Rao said they are awaiting the official order on the merger of the 13 new mandals into the VMRDA. “The VMRDA is preparing its master plan-2041 and perspective plan-2051 to fully leverage the development potential of the region. The plans will draft suitable development strategies for each part of the three north-coastal districts to locate industries, housing projects, commercial and trade centres, mobility solutions and IT parks. The VMRDA will get a new land bank through the development of new housing projects in the district. New residential townships will be developed in the suburbs to decrease stress in the core city area,” said Srinivasa Rao.

The chairman added that the VMRDA also plans to develop an information technology park on about 200 acres of land in the city along the lines of Hitec city in Hyderabad. “We need rental assurance to take up the project. The VMRDA has begun its negotiations with various IT companies in this direction,” said Srinivasa Rao.

Amaravati: TDP MLC Dokka Manikyavaraprasad resigned from the legislative council on Tuesday, saying he decided to quit in protest against the trifurcation of the capital. He, however, sent his resignation letter to party supremo N Chandrababu Naidu instead of legislative council chairman MA Sheriff.

The TDP leadership is said to be upset with Dokka’s resignation as he announced his decision just an hour before the legislative council took up discussion on the three-capital plan. Dokka claimed that he was the first person to have moved the proposal to set up the capital city in Amaravati.

Dokka further said that he has decided not to contest any direct elections in future keeping in view his experiences in the 2019 elections. He thanked Naidu and party national general secretary Nara Lokesh for giving him the opportunity to serve the council and people of AP. Dokka got elected to the legislative council in 2017 and still has three years to serve as his term will come to an end in 2023.

A two-time legislator from Tadikonda constituency between 2004 to 2014, Dokka served as minister in the cabinets of YS Rajasekhara Reddy, Konijeti Rosaiah and Kiran Kumar Reddy. He quit the Congress after the 2014 general elections and joined TDP. Although he received many offers to join the YSRC in the past, he continued to remain in TDP. He contested from Prattipadu assembly constituency in 2019 elections and lost to Mekathoti Sucharitha of YSRC.

Edited. 300 words.

Times News Network

Saligao: Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) on Tuesday condemned statements made by South Western Railway (SWR) manager Ajay Singh to BJP Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha, and demanded his immediate suspension.

Saldanha, who was objecting to the double-tracking of the railway on Sunday, took offence to statements Singh made while she protested the proposed demolition of houses in her constituency to make way for SWR’s project. “India has houses that are 5,000 years old. Goans were the invading force that came about 500 years back. When you all came, you all also must have destroyed houses here,” Singh had said on Sunday, while quickly adding, “By you, I meant Portuguese.”

Congress spokesperson Trajano D’Mello demanded that the railways official be immediately suspended for at least 15 days, “so that it sets a precedent for other officers while dealing with the citizens of this country and state”. “When an elected representative who is a former minister is called Portuguese, our fears are coming true that BJP is playing the divisive politics of hatred towards other communities,” D’Mello added.

Meanwhile, Congress Bicholim block president Megashyam Raut, who was among those arrested for agitating near the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue in Bicholim last week, claimed MGP had lost sight of its ideals so much that it did not even recognise Shivaji in the country. Raut was arrested along with five others for burning a poster of former MGP Bicholim MLA Naresh Sawal in protest of a letter Sawal had written to the Bicholim PWD executive engineer (roads) stating that the statue posed an obstacle to vehicles and caused several accidents.

“New and young Congress functionaries are taking shape. BJP and MGP are frightened and are all out to suppress people like Raut,” Congress Mapusa block president Vijai Bhike, said.

KOLHAPUR: Ichalkaranji police have busted an inter-state truck theft racket and have arrested a man in connection with the case.

They have also seized six stolen trucks worth Rs 74 lakh from the suspect. The trucks were stationed at Ankali in Chikodi and Nipani in Belgaum of Karnataka. Two more suspects involved in the crime are absconding, said police.

The arrested suspect has been identified as Jamir Ibrahim Harchikar (43), a resident of Subhashnagar, Kolhapur . He was produced before a local court on Monday and remanded to two-day police custody.

“Two weeks ago, a truck parked near a petrol pump in Herle village was stolen. A team investigating the case received a tip-off that the stolen truck was seen at Ankali village in Karnataka. The team also received information about three suspects and their involvement in stealing and selling trucks at cheap rates. Acting on the information, the team raided the spot in Ankali and nabbed Harchikar,” said a police officer attached with the Ichalkaranji police station.

The officer also said that initial investigation suggested that three suspects were involved in stealing the crime. Harchikar was the one who would look for potential buyer and sell trucks at cheap rates. “After stealing trucks, the trio would give a complete makeover to them. They would also detach spare parts of the truck, tamper with the registration number printed on chassis and later sell them at cheap rates,” he said.

This is the second such gang arrested by the police in south Maharashtra. In 2013, Sangli police busted an inter-state truck theft racket and seized tyres and spare parts of trucks hidden in a godown near the Sagareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Palus taluka of Sangli district.

AHMEDABAD: Police were puzzled on coming across a case where cyber fraudsters first spent Rs 49,851 on a woman’s credit card and then paid Rs 20, 131 to the credit card account.

In her FIR with Bopal police, Pooja Banerjee, resident of Aangan Society near Adani Shantigram in Khodiyar, states that she works for a private company.

“On June 13, 2019, Banerjee received a call from an unknown number where a man introduced himself as being from the BRTS complaint board and told her to pay Rs 20 using a link he sent to her phone via a message. When she paid the money using her credit card, she got a message for a Rs 20 deduction,” states FIR.

A couple of seconds later, she got another message about a Rs 49,851 transaction on the same credit card, linked to a private bank.

“On June 14, 2019, she blocked her credit card and filed an application of complaint with the cyber cell of city crime branch. That day itself, the fraudsters paid Rs 20,131 into her credit card account,” the FIR states.

The Rs 29,720 was apparently used to buy various articles from a mall at Biharsharif in Nalanda district of Bihar.

She stated in the FIR that as the cyber cell of city crime branch was inquiring into the case she did not move a complaint with Bopal police. Later, she filed a complaint with Bopal police under charges of cheating and breach of trust along with offences under the Information Technology (IT) Act.

Inspector Anila Brahmbhatt of Bopal police said the accused introduced himself as employee of a BRTS complaint authority but he did not make it clear which BRTS they were talking about.

“We have begun an investigation in the case but have not yet tracked down the accused person,” Brahmbhatt said.

AHMEDABAD: A van carrying children to a school in the Jodhpur area of the city met with an accident on Tuesday morning, when a speeding car rammed into it from behind on SG Road in Satellite. The collision was of such intensity that the school van, carrying 10 children, turned turtle. Three children and the van driver suffered injuries.

Despite this, no police complaint was filed in the case as the driver of the car that hit the van was the driver of a controversial IPS officer.

“The incident occurred at around 7.30am on Tuesday, when the van was rammed from behind by the car driven by the IPS officer’s driver, who about 35 years old. One of the three injured children, a six-year-old Class I girl, suffered severe injuries and was rushed to a private hospital. She was discharged after being treated for about an hour,” said a trustee of the school. The van driver was also injured.

He said that the parents concerned did not want to move a complaint as they feared a protracted legal battle.

“The driver, who works for an IPS officer who was involved in an encounter case, apologized and the also parents did not want to file a cases. So, we preferred not to move a complaint,” said the trustee. Parents rushed to the school to ensure their children are safe. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), traffic (west), Ajit Rajian, said the cops were waiting to lodge an FIR but no complaint was moved.

The restriction was imposed by based on the complaint by Kerala state animal welfare board member, M N Jayachandran.

Guruvayoor Devaswom deputy administrator Sasidharan told TOI, “the Devaswom welcomes the expert committee to examine the tuskers Guruvayoor Padmanabhan and Valiyakesavan at any time. Our request is that the officials should complete the inspection at the earliest and take a decision soon. Our expert team already inspected the elephants and submitted a report and there were no health issues found.” Thrissur assistant conservator P M Prabhu said, “The inspection of the elephants is already delayed. I requested the expert team to inspect the tuskers at the earliest and submit a report immediately”.

However, the forest department began action against the parading of injured elephants in the temple festivals. On Tuesday officials returned two elephants Kongad Kuttishankaran and Chulliparampil Vishnu Shankar, from the Vellikkulangara Devi Temple festival at Kakkasery near Pavaratty. “Both elephants Kongad Kuttishankaran and Chulliparampil Vishnu Shankar, returned from the festival because they it was found that they were suffering from unhealed wounds. We will not allow injured elephants to be paraded at festivals,” said Prabhu.

103,['22/01/2020'],Delhi assembly elections: JD(U) senior writes to Nitish Kumar over BJP tie-up,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Nitish Kumar and Pavan K Verma

NEW DELHI: In an embarrassment for Nitish Kumar , his Janata Dal (United) colleague Pavan K Varma has questioned the party’s alliance with BJP in the Delhi assembly polls , alleging that in private conversations, the Bihar chief minister had always held that the saffron party was leading the country into a dangerous space.

Varma, who along with another JD(U) functionary — political consultant Prashant Kishor — has been pressing Kumar to reverse his support for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), said the Bihar chief minister did not change his dim opinion of BJP even after he had dropped his “RSS Mukt Bharat” plank to revive his alliance with the saffron party. “It was your personal view, as conveyed to me, that BJP is destroying institutions, and that there is a need for democratic and socialist forces within the country to regroup, a task for which you actually assigned a senior party official,” Varma said in a letter to the chief minister.

The former career diplomat further said: “If these are your real views, I fail to understand how JD(U) is now extending its alliance with BJP beyond Bihar, when even long-standing allies of BJP like Shiromani Akali Dal have refused to do so. This is especially so at a time when BJP, through the CAA-NPR-NRC combine, has embarked on a massive socially divisive agenda aimed at mutilating peace, harmony and stability of the country.

“In view of the above, I think there is an urgent need for JD(U) to harmonise what the party’s constitution says, what the leader of the party feels in private, and what actions the party takes in public. Politics, as you have emphasised to us, must be about principles and courage of conviction.”

Varma’s letter came a day after JD(U) dropped him and Prashant Kishor from the list of its “star campaigners” for the Delhi state elections.

BJP has left two seats — Sangam Vihar and Burari — for JD(U) candidates S C L Gupta and Shailendra Kumar, respectively. While JD(U) refrained from responding to Varma, it pressed ahead with its decision to tie up with BJP, with Nitish’s trusted colleague and Bihar irrigation minister Sanjay Jha attending the press conference where the tie-up was announced.

Sources in JD(U) dismissed Varma’s outburst as the rant of a “frustrated careerist”, and said he has been looking for fresh options after his Rajya Sabha term ended. “All this is plain posturing meant for secular galleries in New Delhi. Varma joined JD(U) when it was in alliance with BJP. He chose to remain with the party when Nitishji decided to return to NDA,” said a senior JD(U) source who insisted on anonymity. He also claimed that Kishor was appointed JD(U) vice-president on BJP’s recommendation.

In his letter, Varma said, “Mahatma Gandhi, Lohia, JP — the icons of our party — would have, I strongly believe, unequivocally denounced this (BJP’s) agenda, and fought it tooth and nail. I look forward to receiving some ideological clarity from you, either in a formal meeting of JD(U), or through such means as you consider best.”

Saligao: Congress on Tuesday condemned statements made by South Western Railway (SWR) manager Ajay Kumar Singh to BJP Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha, and demanded his suspension.

Saldanha, who was objecting to the double-tracking of the railway on Sunday, took offence to statements Singh made while she protested the proposed demolition of houses in her constituency to make way for the project. “India has houses that are 5,000 years old. Goans were the invading force that came 500 years back. When you all came, you all also must have destroyed houses here,” Singh had said on Sunday, while quickly adding, “By you, I meant Portuguese.”

Congress spokesperson Trajano D’Mello demanded that Singh be immediately suspended for at least 15 days. “When an elected representative is called Portuguese, our fears are coming true that BJP is playing the divisive politics of hatred towards other communities,” D’Mello said.

Congress Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco demanded that CM Pramod Sawant take Singh to task by complaining to railways minister Piyush Goyal. “If severe action is not taken, it will give a ticket to other government officials who visit Goa in the name of development to humiliate Goans again,” he said.

107,['22/01/2020'],Bureaucrats angle for prime land in Port City,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Visakhapatnam: With Visakhapatnam soon set to become the executive capital of the state, bureaucrats are angling for prime land in the city.

According to sources, the government may allot the land close to Rushikonda-Kapuluppada area provided they return the land allotted to them in Amaravati.

One of the IAS officers said there was no official communication from the government about land allotment in Visakhapatnam. “But senior IAS staff are proposing to seek land at the beach side hill where the Adani group was allotted land earlier,” the officer said.

Around 500 acre land was given to the Adani group early in 2019 to set up a data centre and technology park near a heritage site in Kapuluppada village with a proposed investment to the tune of Rs. 70,000 crore in the next 20 years.

Forum for Better Visakha, a civic group, had alleged that the market value of that land would be more than Rs. 2000 crore but the government had allotted the land at a subsidized rate to the group. Since the Adani group has allegedly revised its investment plan to only 80 acres with an investment to Rs. 3,000 crore in the next couple of years, vacant land may be given to the bureaucrats, sources said.

“Our association has not approached the government till now. A few of our seniors have however proposed this land. We came to know that the government, too, is seriously thinking about it,” said one of the IAS officers.

In December 2018, around 170 IAS and IPS officers were given around 25 acres between Nelapadu and Tulluru in the capital city region. According to sources, registrations of these plots had been taken place.

The allotment was made by the Group of Ministers headed by the then municipal minister P Narayana. Each IAS and IPS officer was given 500 sq yards at a price of Rs. 5,000 per sq yard.

The TDP government had also allotted 238 acre land for CRDA employees. The TDP government had frozen all registrations at Tulluru sub-registrar office for one week to facilitate registration of these plots.

111,['22/01/2020'],Rajinikanth raises a storm with his remark on E V R Periyar,"Actor Rajinikanth

‘We will meet him (Rajini) in court’

CHENNAI: Even as activists representing various Periyarist movements demanded an apology from actor Rajinikanth for his recent speech against E V R Periyar with respect to a rally taken out in Salem by the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1971, the actor refused to apologise or express regret for his comments. Hailed as a social reformer, Periyar founded DK, which had its basis in rationalism. The DMK was an offshoot of the DK.“I did not say anything that was a figment of my imagination nor anything that was untrue,” Rajinikanth told reporters on Tuesday. “Idhu marukkakoodiya sambavam alla, marakkakoodiya sambavam (The issue needs to be forgotten, not denied),” said the actor.“My recent speech at the ‘Thuglak’ (a Tamil magazine) function has raised a controversy. What I said was based on what I read and what I heard. If someone expects me to apologise and express regret for it, I am sorry. I will neither apologise nor express regret,” Rajinikanth told reporters outside his Poes Garden residence in Chennai, flashing a photocopy of an article that appeared in an English magazine in the year 2017.Participating in the golden jubilee celebrations of ‘Thuglak’ in Chennai last week, Rajini spoke about a 1971 rally in Salem organised by Periyar. He said “portraits of Rama and Sita without clothes decorated by garlands of slippers” were carried in a procession.“While no other media covered it, Thuglak carried it on its cover,” he said. An infuriated DMK government ordered for the copies of Thuglak to be seized, leading to a spike in demand for the magazine, the actor added. Soon, Periyarists from various organisations condemned Rajinikanth for his speech and denied that the rally had carried portraits that depicted Rama and Sita in a derogatory fashion and demanded his apology. Some political parties like VCK threatened to gherao his residence and police complaints were filed against the actor by Periyarists in several places in the state. “Let them say what they want. I will stand by what I said,” Rajinikanth told reporters. “In his speech at the Thuglak function, Rajinikanth spoke about the magazine having carried on its cover photos of the 1971 rally. Instead of producing that copy of the magazine, why is Rajinikanth falling back on an English magazine,” asked Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam founder Kolathur Mani, soon after Rajinikanth refused to apologise.Meanwhile, a group of Periyarists staged a protest in the city asking Rajinikanth to apologise. They also threatened to march towards his house, but police prevented them. Dravidar Kazhagam general secretary K Veeramani too joined issue with Rajinikanth. “He is answerable to the court. We will meet him in the court,” Veeramani told TOI.DMK president M K Stalin asked Rajinikanth to think before he talked about Periyar. “Rajinikanth is an actor. Not a politician. Periyar spent a major part of his 95 years working for the welfare of Tamils. Rajinikanth should think twice before saying anything about Periyar,” Stalin said.But, his son and DMK youth wing president Udhayanidhi Stalin was more brazen in his attack on the actor. “Rajinikanth will apologize once he realizes what he said was wrong. He has done so in the past over Cauvery, when he apologized to the people of Karnataka,” Udhayanidhi told reporters, taking a dig at the actor.The ruling AIADMK too was quick in coming to Periyar’s defense. “One should speak about Periyar only after understanding his ideology. His ideologies are to be treated with respect and enshrined on a high pedestal. It is only because of Periyar I have rose to this level in life,” said deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami steered clear of the issue at a public meeting in Salem.“While saying such an incident (the Salem rally) should be forgotten, why is Rajini bringing it up? Is he going to be given a doctorate? Saying something against Periyar, who is respected by all, should be condemned,” said senior minister D Jayakumar.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73507162,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-277301,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-apology-for-periyar-remark-says-rajini-parties-warn-actor/articleshow/73501619.cms
112,['22/01/2020'],"Jain cave turn home of bats, fades into obscurity","This story is from January 22, 2020

CHENNAI: Colonies of bats hanging from the ceiling of an ancient cave at a Jain site in Kazhugumalai in Tuticorin district paints a picture of apathy. It shows how lack of care and maintenance can destroy a rich heritage site.

Maintained by the department of archaeology, government of Tamil Nadu, the bas relief at Kazhugumalai has three rows of more than 100 Tirthankaras seated on a lotus pedestal. Even though the hill is known for its famous 8th century bas relief of Tirthankaras and the unfinished Pandyan era monolithic cave temple, it doesn’t get the attention it deserves.

A watchman has a tough time managing the site, which is frequented by vandals. Those who visit the site return after seeing the bas relief since there is no one to guide them about their importance. A Hindu temple built later obstructs the right side of the bas relief of the Tirthankaras. Added to this, animal sacrifices take place in the temple, which is taboo to the Jains who believe in non-violence and compassion.

""We have been raising the issue for long, but no action has been taken so far. The site lacks maintenance. The gate of the cave remains locked, and visitors don’t get the opportunity to see what’s inside,"" said Mukesh Jain, a heritage enthusiast, who also runs a matchbox manufacturing unit in Kovilpatti.

The labels written in Vattezhuthu that appear along with the bas relief of Jain Tirthankaras mention names of the donors and provisions made for offering. ""The main deity on the hill, according to the lone information board of the department of archaeology, was Aramalai Alwar, the other figures were erected by the followers of the Jains from the nearby villages,"" said Jain.

The sculptures were erected in memory of the departed. There were carpenters, potters, smiths and others behind the creation of this great piece of art. It is believed that Gunasagar Bhattara, a great Jain ascetic, lived on the hill and it was a big centre of Jainism for long. The bas relief and inscriptions, according to historians, date back to the reign of Pandya king Parantaka Nedunjedaiyan (AD768-800).

The monolithic temple, hewn out of a rock hill a little away from the bas relief of the Tirthankaras, stands testimony to the rich architectural heritage of the Pandyas.

Badri Seshadri, who has studied in detail the different faiths in Kazhugumalai, said it’s high time the state government took steps to protect the site.

""The monolithic temple is an architectural marvel by the Pandyas. You can see such structures only in Ellora. The sculptures around the temple are outstanding. The archaeology department of the state government should take steps to protect the site from vandals,"" he said.

Vijayawada/Visakhapatnam: The official Republic Day function of the AP government, which was earlier proposed to be held in Visakhapatnam , will now be held in Vijayawada.

Vijayawada, which is part of the AP capital region, has been the venue for all official functions. But after the government came up with the idea of three capital cities with Visakhapatnam proposed as the executive capital, it decided to hold the Republic Day celebrations in the Port City this year. Even as the district administration in Visakhapatnam was busy with the arrangements, the government on Tuesday morning decided to shift the venue back to Vijayawada. The move comes in the wake of growing anger among people in the capital region over the shifting of the state administration to Visakhapatnam. Officials in Vijayawada are now racing against time to make the arrangements for the celebrations.

Meanwhile, authorities in Krishna district and Vijayawada Municipal Corporation have started arrangements for the celebrations at Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium (IGMS). Officials have decided to work round the clock to complete all arrangements by January 25. Krishna district joint collector Madhavi Latha, VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh, and sub-collector Dhyana Chandra inspected the arrangements at IGMS stadium on Tuesday. Madhavi asked the police to increase security as governor Biswabushan Harichandan is going to hoist the flag. Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy and high court chief justice J K Maheswari will participate in the high tea after the flag hoisting, she said.

After receiving information about the venue change, Visakhapatnam police removed the stage and shifted all contingents of the parade to Vijayawada. “We have received a message from senior officials saying that the venue was shifted from here to Vijayawada,” police chief Meena told TOI. The Visakhapatnam district administration had even prepared about two dozen tableau highlighting the government’s Navaratnalu scheme.

AHMEDABAD: After revival in equity-based investments since September 2019, the growth in investments has once again slowed. The overall assets under management (AUM) in equity-based mutual funds in Gujarat remained almost stagnant in December 2019, growing barely at 1.1%, from Rs 80,398.3 crore in November 2019 to Rs 81,319.8 crore in December, suggests data by Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). Experts attribute the slowing growth to withdrawals from the equity markets and slowing fresh investments.“Overall investments were slow due to volatility in the stock markets. Moreover, when the stock markets delivered good returns in December against most part of 2019, there were significant withdrawals, especially from high net worth individuals (HNIs) and corporates. With gold prices going up and showing promising returns, several investors have diverted investments to gold as well,” said Jayesh Vithlani, a city-based financial consultant.AUM for equity-based mutual funds had significantly slowed till August when it showed a 3.09% de-growth, after which it began growing. The growth in AUM in Gujarat was at 4.49% in November, after which the growth slowed.Analysts said that SIPs went up significantly, across the country. The remaining investments remained stagnant. “December-January is typically the time when Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) do not make any investment decision.

Speaking to TOI on Tuesday, Parsekar asked why should only he be blamed by the Lokayuka when the cabinet took the decision to renew the mining leases.

He also said that the high court directed the state government to formulate the lease renewal policy and the government accordinaly formulated it. He said the high court gave the government 90 days to do so, and after the policy was notified, it was conveyed to the high court.

Parsekar said his government renewed the mining leases because the state was in financial crisis and the government had to pay the mining dependents through various schemes.

The former CM said that the renewal was challenged in the SC, which quashed the renewal of 88 leases.

He however said that the court didn’t touch the Goa Foundation prayer that an FIR should be filed.

SAMBHAL: The court of Sambhal district and sessions judge Ashwani Kumar Tripathi on Tuesday granted bail to four protesters arrested during the recent anti-CAA rallies, including a Jamia Milia Islamia University engineering student.

They were among the 27 people arrested for violence during the anti-CAA protest at Chandusi Chauraha on December 20. SHO of Sambhal Kotwali police station, Ravindra Pratap Singh, had lodged the FIR against protesters under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapons), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly), 307 (attempt to murder), 332 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant), 336 (endangering life or personal safety of others) and sections 3 and 4 of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. Section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act was also invoked. All protesters arrested from Sambhal were lodged in Bareilly district jail.

Speaking to TOI, defence counsel advocate Zaki Anwar said, “We told the court that cops had illegally arrested the student, who had nothing to do with the violence on December 20.”

Anwar added the court released Ehtaisham Nabi, third year student of BSc (engineering) at JMI, New Delhi, when he was returning home with his friends Hassan and Shahrukh, both students of a college in Sambhal. All three are residents of Hindupura Khera in Deepa Sarai. The fourth person who was released by the court on Tuesday is Arshad, a labourer.

District government counsel (DGC) Satya Pal Singh Gurjar opposed the bail plea at the hearing. Later, he said, “We vehemently opposed bail application of the accused persons, who were involved in the violence on December 20.”

Another defense counsel, Tauseef Khan alias Mikky, said, “The court granted bail to all four accused, against two sureties of Rs 60,000 each, and stated that during the bail term, the accused will cooperate with the probe, not tamper evidence, and not make any threats against witnesses.”

119,['22/01/2020'],Morbi coal-to-gas switch turns into a case study,"cap

Ahmedabad: At a time when India leads in pollution-linked deaths, the country’s ceramic hub at Morbi in Gujarat has emerged as a striking example of how switching to natural gas from polluting fuels in industry can help eliminate air and environmental pollution.A latest report by International Gas Union (IGU), headquartered in Barcelona, titled ‘Case studies in improving urban air quality - 2019’, highlights the success story of Morbi in creating a gas-based economy. This is the fourth edition of the Clean Air Report series by the IGU. Apart from Morbi, there are six other case studies, including London in UK and Bogota, Colombia.“The city of Morbi in the Gujarat region of India achieved a dramatic reduction of air pollution and environmental contamination, thanks to switching from coal to natural gas in its ceramic industry,” the report stated.Morbi is a mid-sized city of Gujarat known for its contribution to the global ceramic sector, with a total of 900 ceramic manufacturing units, which contribute significantly to the region’s economy. The use of coal gasifiers in the manufacture of ceramic tiles was making ambient air quality of the area very poor causing problems to the citizens of the area and regulators of the state.The National Green Tribunal in its order in March 2019 banned the use of gasification technology in the ceramic units of Morbi-Wankaner area and ordered Gujarat Pollution Control Board to shut down all the coal gasifiers of this area. As a result, all ceramic units of the area switched over to piped natural gas immediately with the supply and network already available to them.“The switch to natural gas brought immediate results and translated into significantly improved air quality readings, with a 75% reduction in PM 2.5 levels, 72% reduction in PM 10, and an 85% reduction in SO2 (sulfur dioxide),” the report states. In addition to the air quality improvement, there were significant other environmental benefits, including reduced water consumption and avoidance of emissions due to reduced coal truckloads, according to the report by IUG that has over 150 members worldwide, representing approximately 95% of the world gas market.The NGT decision came as a result of a recommendation made by an expert committee which found that “coal gasification is a dangerous process” that generated highly carcinogenic waste on the scale of 8,000 kg per day.“A month after NGT’s order, gas consumption in Morbi nearly doubled, from 2 million cubic metres (MCM) a day to almost 4 MCM, and it is expected to reach 8 MCM in the near future. At the same time, coal consumption dropped by 900 MT/Day, with the associated decrease in heavy vehicle movement, and the savings of 2,250 thousand litres of freshwater per day,” the report states.A report by the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution (GAHP) last month said that India suffered most pollution-linked deaths in the world, with 2.3 million followed by China with 1.8 million.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/morbi-coal-to-gas-switch-turns-into-a-case-study/articleshow/73493943.cms

Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad

NEW DELHI: In a democracy where elections are the biggest celebrations , there is a need to ensure maximum participation , a Delhi court on Tuesday said while modifying the bail conditions imposed on Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad with respect to his movement in Delhi.

The court also remarked, “Democracy cannot be reduced to a farce. It is necessary to ensure that any conditions imposed upon the accused that come in the way of participation in elections are modified.”

On the apprehension raised by Azad’s counsels — Mehmood Pracha, OP Bharti and MS Arya — who argued that the bail order had in a way restricted their client’s entry to Delhi, judge Kamini Lau clarified that there was never a prohibition.

Delhi Police opposed Azad’s plea stating that he had violated the bail condition by visiting Valmiki temple when he had only been permitted to visit three places — Jama Masjid, Jor Bagh and Guru Ravidas temple.

The bail condition of the January 15 order had said, “Azad shall not visit Delhi for the next four weeks and whenever the applicant/accused is required to come to Delhi for his medical treatment, he shall inform his schedule to the DCP (crime).”

Azad’s counsel argued that restrictions on his visits to Delhi for four weeks, except for treatment, came in the way of his right to participate in awareness camps and in advising the poor, weak and downtrodden sections of the society and minorities. The prosecution submitted that Azad had a history of making hate speeches and a possibility of him indulging in a similar act could not be ruled out.

A senior police officer present in court was asked if there was any “cogent material with police” supporting its contention. Finding no such material on record, the court said, “The ACP admits that as of now there is no material on record to show that after his release, the applicant indulged in acts that affect the law and order, public order or national security.”

On finding no concrete material, the court modified the bail conditions. Azad was directed to mark his presence before the police station concerned at Saharanpur, UP every Saturday till February 16. He also has to mark his presence before DCP (Crime) if he is in Delhi. “In case he is at any other place, he shall intimate to the DCP (Crime) about the same either on telephone or through email till February 16, after which he would only be required to mark his attendance on the last Saturday of every month till further orders,” the court said.

Arvinder S Lovely, Raghav Chadha and Kapil Mishra

NEW DELHI: With the filing of nominations now over, the next few days will see the three major political parties get into hectic campaigning mode to woo voters. While AAP, BJP and Congress claim to have fielded their “best bets” for the 70 seats, the focus will be on about 15-odd seats where the heavyweight candidates are contesting.

Apart from New Delhi and Patparganj assembly constituencies, where chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia are seeking re-election, Model Town , Rajendra Nagar, Kalkaji, Okhla, Matia Mahal, Gandhi Nagar, Krishna Nagar, Chandni Chowk, Dwarka and Mangolpuri are the seats that will witness a keen contest this time.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

By nominating from Model Town former AAP minister Kapil Mishra, who has turned into one of the most vocal critics of Kejriwal, BJP has tried a big gamble. Mishra has been pitted against two-time MLA Akhilesh Pati Tripathi. Congress has fielded Akanksha Ola, former MLA Kunwar Karan Singh’s daughter.

High voltage campaigning will be witnessed in the next few days at Gandhi Nagar, Krishna Nagar and Ballimaran from where former Delhi ministers Arvinder Singh Lovely, Ashok Kumar Walia and Haroon Yusuf are contesting. In Gandhi Nagar, BJP has fielded former AAP MLA Anil Kumar Bajpai. Lovely had comfortably won the 2013 poll from this seat, but stayed away in 2015.

Walia, who won four elections from Laxmi Nagar before losing to AAP in 2013 and 2015, has moved to the neighbouring Krishna Nagar seat. A part of Walia’s erstwhile seat was added to Krishna Nagar in the 2007 delimitation exercise. AAP’s SK Bagga, who had defeated BJP’s CM face Kiran Bedi in the 2015 poll by a thin margin, is re-contesting from this seat.

Former Congress heavyweight and Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra’s daughter Shivani is debuting from Kalkaji. She is pitted against AAP’s Atishi, who had contested the 2019 Lok Sabha from East Delhi constituency, but lost.

In Rajendra Nagar, AAP’s Raghav Chadha is pitted against BJP’s Sikh face RP Singh, who had won the 2013 assembly election but lost in 2015. AAP has replaced its sitting MLA and brought in Chadha, who unsuccessfully contested the 2109 Lok Sabha election from South Delhi. Congress has fielded former DUSU president Rocky Tuseed.

Chandni Chowk will see a repeat of the 2015 polls, but this time the candidates have switched sides. Former Congress MLA Parlad Singh Sawhney, who lost the 2015 election to AAP’s Alka Lamba, has now been fielded by the governing party. Lamba, who joined AAP in 2015 after a long stint with Congress, is back with the grand old party. BJP has again fielded Suman Kumar Gupta, the runner-up in the 2015 election.

Dwarka will also witness a repeat of sorts with former Congress MP Mahabal Mishra’s son Vinay contesting on an AAP ticket. AAP MLA Adarsh Shastri is fighting this election on a Congress ticket. BJP’s former MLA from this seat, Pradyumn Rajput, is a constant.

Alappuzha: The farmers of Kerala’s rice bowl are gearing up to start agitation programmes against the state government as they have not received the money for the paddy procured by the state government last year.

The farmers have already submitted a memorandum to agriculture minister V S Sunilkumar seeking his immediate intervention for distributing the price of the paddy as soon as possible.

The second round of cultivation at Kuttanad began last year in June and ended in December. Paddy procurement was completed in April. It was Kerala state civil supplies corporation that procured paddy from the peasants by deploying mill owners. Over 15,000 farmers have conducted the cultivation in 12,000 hectares in Kuttanad and the farmers need to get Rs 2,695 per quintal.

Kuttanad Karshaka Sangam members said that after procuring the paddy, the civil supplies department and mill owners gave them paddy receipt sheet (PRS) after taking their paddy and the farmers took loan from the banks after submitting those receipts. “As per the loan condition, the bank can collect the loan amount from our bank account, when the state government credits the price of the procured paddy in our bank account. This time, the state government has not credited the amount till date. So, banks started to demand us to pay the loan amount. It will create huge financial burden on us and the state government should take immediate steps for distributing the amount,” said the farmers.

“We have conducted the second round of cultivation after facing a lot of hurdles. Though we got good yields, the floods destroyed our paddy fields. The expected paddy crops per acre was 25 quintals minimum. But due to the flood, we got only around 15 quintals minimum and the state government completed the paddy procurement by April. Now, the puncha cultivation is going on and the harvesting of ‘puncha’ cultivation will begin in February. Our condition will become more pathetic in coming days if the government delays the distribution of the amount of the second-round cultivation. If the government continues its lethargic attitude towards us, we will not conduct second of round cultivation this year,” said the farmers.

Tinto K Edayadi, a farmer said that if they did not get a positive reply from the government, they will start agitation soon.

AHMEDABAD: In a rare move, the civic body on Tuesday began demolition of an illegal six-floor apartment in Jamalpur area amidst protests from local residents.

The construction work of the Hajim Residency near Jani nu Dhelu was earlier stalled by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) estate department on December 16 last year. The occupants were asked to vacate and a police case was registered against the builder.

On Tuesday morning, when the civic team’s demolition staff reached the spot under Gaekwad police protection, a number of women residents protested the demolition. The civic officials stalled the demolition work claiming that there were not enough women constables.

However, in a few hours more women constable reinforcements were brought in. “On Tuesday we broke the partition wall from the ground up to the sixth floor. The demolition work will continue on Wednesday,” says a senior AMC official.

NEW DELHI: Trolled heavily on social media after his name didn’t figure in the first list of 57 candidates released by the party on Saturday, Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga found his name on the list early Tuesday as the party candidate from Hari Nagar. Hari Nagar has a sizeable population of Sikhs and Punjabis though Bagga’s first choice was Tilak Nagar.

Bagga was one of the 10 candidates whose names were announced by the BJP hours after the party’s talk for seat sharing arrangement with its oldest ally, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), failed. The second list of BJP candidates included four such seats – Hari Nagar, Rajouri Garden, Kalkaji and Shahdara – that had gone to SAD in previous elections.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

The BJP has this time given two seats – Burari and Sangam Vihar — to its Bihar ally, Janata Dal (United), while Loktantrik Janshakti Party (LJP) has fielded its candidate from the reserved constituency of Seemapuri. The saffron party will contest on the remaining 67 seats. BJP, JD(U) and LJP announced their formal seat sharing arrangement on Tuesday at a press conference at Delhi BJP headquarters.

Janata Dal (U) candidate Shailender Kumar has been fielded from Burari constituency while SCL Gupta will fight from Sangam Vihar seat on the party ticket. LJP candidate Santlal Chawaria will contest from Seemapuri reserved seat.

Minutes after his candidature was announced, Bagga, who has a huge twitter presence with over 6.5 lakh followers, posted a rap song, ‘Bagga, Bagga Har Jagah’. He had hit the headlines in October 2011 when he was accused of assaulting lawyer Prashant Bhushan at his Supreme Court chambers for his views on Kashmir. He was also accused of attacking writer Arundhati Roy during an event a few months later. In 2012, Bagga claimed credit for attacking Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani. He was appointed as Delhi BJP’s spokesperson in 2017.

The other candidates in BJP’s second list included Manish Singh, a Poorvanchali from Delhi Cantonment, former MLA Manoj Shokeen’s wife, Sumanlata (Nangloi Jat), Ramesh Khanna (Rajouri Garden), Sunil Yadav (New Delhi), Ravindra Chaudhary (Kasturba Nagar), Kusum Khatri (Mehrauli), Dharamveer Singh (Kalkaji), Anil Goyal (Krishna Nagar) and EDMC deputy mayor Sanjay Goyal (Shahdara).

Interestingly, Shahdara MLA in 2013, Jitender Singh Shunty, who was fielded by SAD on a BJP symbol, has also filed his nomination from the same seat as BJP’s dummy candidate. Shunty had lost the 2015 polls from the same seat.

State minister for tribal welfare Pamula Pushpa Sreevani tabled the Andhra Pradesh State Commission for Schedule Tribes Bill on Tuesday that allows setting up of separate commissions for STs. Meanwhile, pandemonium prevailed in the assembly on the second day of the three-day special session as TDP members continued to protest.

Strongly defending the bill proposing separate commissions for SCs and STs, Sreevani accused the TDP of being anti-Dalit as it was stalling the bill, which would help their uplift. Echoing Sreevani, irrigation minister Anil Kumar Yadav lashed out against the TDP members for raising slogans even during the discussion on SC, ST commission bill. He alleged that Chandrababu Naidu and his men have ruined the state in the past five years and are now trying to push the state further backward. He dared TDP deputy floor leader K Atchannaidu to contest the next elections without an alliance with any political party. Social welfare minister P Viswaroop too lashed out at TDP for returning the bill from the council. He said the TDP has not learnt any lesson even after facing drubbing in the elections and continue to discriminate against Dalits .

With TDP members continuing to raise slogans, speaker Tammineni Sitharam left the House in a huff. Although, the speaker resumed the session after an hour, TDP members continued to protest at the well and disrupted the session.

Taking strong exception at TDP’s behaviour, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy said that their behaviour has exposed their prejudice against Dalits. He said YSRC has inducted six Dalit ministers into the cabinet and set up separate corporations for Mala, Madiga and Relli communities among SCs. Jaganmohan Reddy said they won all the SC, ST seats in the assembly except two.

“One among those is from the TDP and other candidate is from Jana Sena. After witnessing our (government) welfare programs, the JS MLA is supporting us. This is a historic decision and I request everyone to support the bill,” he said.

AURANGABAD: The crime branch of the city police arrested three people from the Kat Kat gate area of the city and recovered demonetised currency notes with a face value of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, amounting to Rs Rs 25.8 lakh.

Citing the seizure record, crime branch inspector Madhukar Sawant said that total 4,180 demonetised currency notes had been recovered from the suspects.

Of them, 980 were notes having a face value of Rs 1,000 and 3,200 notes had a face value of Rs 500, taking the total tally to Rs 25.8 lakh.

The suspects were carrying the notes in two different cloth bags and had gone to Kat Kat gate area in an autorickshaw to exchange the notes.

Police sources said that assistant inspector Gautam Wavle received a tip-off about the suspects reaching Kat Kat Gate area for exchanging the demonetized notes with valid currency notes.

Accordingly, a trap was laid by the crime branch team. Soon after the team intercepted the auto-rickshaw, one of the suspects identified as Umar Ghulamnabi Shaikh (37) from Jadhavwadi started fleeing with the bags containing the demonetised notes .

While chasing, both Wavle and the suspects fell on the road and sustained minor injuries. The suspects were detained for interrogation on Monday. After carrying out a detailed panchnama, an offence was registered against the suspects under relevant sections of The Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017, at the Jinsi police station on Tuesday.

Authorities said that apart from Umar, the two other suspects have been identified as Moin Munir Shaikh (35) from Kanchanwadi and Azharuddin Ahmed Syed (37) from Indiranagar area in the city.

“One of the suspects is a real-estate agent while the two others are autorickshaw drivers.Preliminary probe has revealed that they were offered a few thousand rupees for exchanging the demonetised notes,” said Sawant.

Assistant commissioner of police (crime) Nagnath Kole said that the crime branch had identified the man, who had handed over the demonetised notes to the suspects, and that soon he would be summoned for interrogation.

Though the offence has been registered at Jinsi police station, the crime branch has been asked to probe the matter given the gravity of the case.

Gujarat high court

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court will hear in third week of February the PIL filed by an NGO Ambedkar Karvan after the Una Dalit youths flogging incident, seeking framing of rules about cremation of dead cows because they are considered ‘Gau Mata’.

When the PIL came up for hearing on Tuesday, the state government sought time to file its reply and the court fixed further hearing on February 18. Meanwhile, the petitioner told the court that it would not press the prayer for framing of rules for cow cremation.

With this, the PIL now seeks directions to the authorities for protection for those engaged in skinning of the carcasses, action against hooligans working as cow vigilantes and rehabilitation of those who want to quit the profession of skinning the carcasses.

In July 2016, the Dalit youths in Una were attacked by cow vigilantes on the pretext of killing a cow, while they were reportedly skinning a dead cow.

132,['22/01/2020'],Second renewal was to satisfy greed of lease holders: Lokayukta,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Panaji: In an important order, Goa Lokayukta , on Monday, observed that the second renewal of 88 mining leases by the state government was not “quite fair” and reasonable and that the real intention was to satisfy the “avariciousness” of lease holders who were motivated by profits to be made through the exploitation of natural resources.

In the order, Goa Lokayukta Justice P K Misra recommended that the state government conduct a CBI inquiry into the second renewal.

“In our opinion, in renewing the mining leases, the state of Goa completely ignored several relevant and important and significant factors, giving the impression that the renewals were not quite fair or reasonable,” the Lokayukta said.

After the Supreme Court had quashed the renewal of mining leases in February 2018 and directed the state government to cease all mining activities by March 15, 2018, NGO Goa Foundation had filed a complaint with the Lokayukta alleging the renewals that were carried out from November 2014 appeared to be “result of corrupt acts” by the then chief minister and officer of directorate of mines. Stating that it was clear that the considerations that weighed with the state were not for the people of Goa, but were for the mining lease holders, the Lokayukta said that this certainly could not be described as “being in the interests of mineral development”.

It is, unfortunately, the undue haste with which the state acted in renewing the leases that gives the impression that it was willing to sacrifice the rule of law for the benefit of the mining lease holders, and the explanation of satisfying the needs of some sections of society for their livelihood (after keeping them in the lurch for more than two years) is a mere fig leaf, the Lokayukta stated. “It appears that to circumvent this rather uncomfortable policy, the state pressed the accelerator on the renewal of mining leases from December 2014 onwards to benefit mining lease holders. So much so, that in respect of five mining leases, the state overstepped the law and granted a second renewal in early January 2015 to some entities without even waiting for any approval or deemed approval of the mining plan from the Indian Bureau of Mines or any other authority,” the Lokayukta said.

Lokayukta said that in the period between January 5, 2015 and January 12, 2015, the state granted a second renewal to as many as 56 mining leases and from November 17, 2014, Goa government granted second renewal to as many as 75 mining leases.

Hari Nagar has a sizeable population of Sikhs and Punjabis though Bagga’s first choice was Tilak Nagar.Bagga was one of the 10 candidates whose names were announced by the BJP hours after the party’s talk for seat sharing arrangement with its oldest ally, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), failed. The second list of BJP candidates included four such seats – Hari Nagar, Rajouri Garden, Kalkaji and Shahdara – that had gone to SAD in previous elections.The BJP has this time given two seats – Burari and Sangam Vihar — to its Bihar ally, Janata Dal (United), while Loktantrik Janshakti Party (LJP) has fielded its candidate from the reserved constituency of Seemapuri. The saffron party will contest on the remaining 67 seats.

135,['22/01/2020'],Imposing Section 144 was unwarranted: Report,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Mangaluru: The report of the People’s Tribunal on the police firing in Mangaluru on December 19 last year, observed that, “The imposition of prohibitory orders under section 144 of CrPC were unwarranted .”

‘Report of the Observations of the People’s Tribunal on the Police firings in Mangalore on December 19, 2019, 6th-7th January 2020’ published by Listening Post (An initiative of the Indian Social Institute-Bangalore, Association for Protection of Civil Rights-Karnataka and the Samvidhanadha Haadiyalli, observed that, “there was no such situation in Mangaluru that required imposition of orders under section 144 of the CrPC.”

The People’s Tribunal is a civil society initiative that was organised by Listening Post, Bengaluru, to report on the December 19 police firing in Mangaluru. The People’s Tribunal comprised Justice (retd) V Gopala Gowda, B T Venkatesh and Sugata Srinivasaraju. The tribunal was tasked with conducting public hearings to hear from all the people affected by the police firing, and to report on the observations made by it.

“It is pertinent to note that none of the ingredients that warrant an imposition of prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC were present. While commissioner of police P S Harsha imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC on the evening of December 18, the order was not effectively communicated to the residents of the area. After the imposition of the prohibitory orders under section 144 of CrPC, permission that was earlier granted was subsequently revoked, but the same was not effectively communicated. As a result of a complete breakdown of communication, civilians who had no connection with the protest were subjected to an indiscriminate lathicharge and police firing,” the team noted.

“The action taken by police personnel present seem to contravene significant limitations on police powers, as provided for in the Karnataka Police Manual. One of the main responsibilities of police officials, as stipulated in Chapter 1 (code of conduct of the Karnataka State Police Force) is to uphold the rights of citizens in accordance with the Constitution,” they observed.

“The victims have suffered immense financial hardship as a result of the atrocities committed on December 19. Further, they noted that it is clear from statements by journalists present at the scene of the violence that force was deliberately administered against journalists, even after they identified themselves to the police officials. This represents a mala fide use of the coercive power of the state to intimidate the press,” the report said.

“From the statements it is observed that great harm was caused to civilians and innocent people who had nothing to do with the protests. Two lives have been lost. The families of victims have been badly affected. They need to be protected and adequately compensated. The entire incident requires to be probed by constituting a judicial commission of inquiry to arrive at the truth,” the report suggested.

Ahmedabad: A division bench of the Gujarat high court has dismissed an appeal seeking directions to the road transport offices (RTOs) in major cities to register sale-purchase of four-wheelers that were compliant to Bharat Stage-III norms and which were manufactured after March 31, 2010.

The litigation was filed after the central government ordered implementation of BS-IV norms. A single-judge bench had rejected such demand in 2014, against which an appeal was filed before the division bench.

The litigation was against the central government’s decision to phase out BS-III in 2009 and a circular issued by the ministry of roads, transport and highways in 2010 for implementation of BS-IV norms for vehicles in order to reduce vehicular pollution in major cities across the country.

This led to restriction on registration of the vehicles of BS-III in cities like Ahmedabad and Surat RTOs upon instructions received from the commissioner of transport.

The litigants had questioned the RTOs’ decision not to register sale of vehicles following BS-III norms.

The special public prosecutor litigating the Vakapalli gang rape case, in which 11 tribal women were allegedly raped by 13 members of the AP Armed Reserve police, said on Tuesday he would be constrained to ask the court to initiate criminal proceedings against the police for failing to present the duty roster and armoury general diary.

Appearing in the special court handling SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act cases in Visakhapatnam, AP, Sunkara Rajendra Prasad, the SPP, said the police had failed to present the duty roster and armoury general diary for the last several months.

“In Tuesday’s proceedings in the Vakapalli case, the reserve inspector from the Armed Reserve submitted to the court that they were unable to trace the duty roster and the armoury general diary,” Prasad said. Prasad had sourced the registers from Paderu police station and the Armed Reserve for information about the deployment of the special police party in August 2007.

Judge OV Nageswara Rao asked the reserve inspector why he had not produced these registers which should be mandatorily maintained. The judge added that if the registers are destroyed, they should at least produce the destruction register.

The SPP concluded that if the police do not make their stand clear, he would be constrained to ask the court to initiate criminal proceedings under Section 349 CrPC against the witnesses for not obeying the court’s summons.

The judge posted the case to February 4 as a last chance to produce the registers.

The Vakapalli case has been pending resolution for over 12 years. Two of the 11 tribal women allegedly raped by 21 members of the AP Armed Reserve died during this period. Eight of the 21 accused policemen were discharged by the AP high court in 2012, while the other 11 are being tried for the gang rape.

Khan, however, joined Congress before the 2013 assembly polls and won.Sources said there was a toss-up between Hashmi and Khan that delayed the announcement of the final five candidates. The final list was out late Monday evening. “For us, winnability was the main criteria. In Okhla, both the candidates were very strong. The election committee deliberated their strengths and weaknesses in detail before picking Hashmi,” said a senior party functionary, adding that Khan’s name in an FIR for inciting violence during the anti-CAA protests probably went against him.“We have carefully chosen our candidates and hope to win the majority,” Congress spokesperson Jitender Kochar said.The party’s last list of five candidates included chief spokesperson and former MLA Mukesh Sharma from Vikaspuri, Parveen Rana from Bijwasan, Mohinder Chaudhary from Mehrauli and Jai Prakash Panwar from the reserved constituency of Madipur.

AURANGABAD: A team of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC)’s department is in Mumbai as the State Election Commission is in the process of finalising the ward formation report. The development is crucial to the AMC general elections scheduled for April.

Overturning its previous circular, the state election commission, on January 3, had told the AMC that the general election of the civic body will be held in single ward pattern. Subsequently, a new ward formation plan was prepared. In the last AMC general election, there were total 113 wards. After Satara and Deolai wards were added in 2016, the number went up to 115. However, the AMC election department had to redefine the boundaries of all wards to meet the election commission’s guideline and divide each ward based on population of 10,000. This was chiefly to adjust the Satara-Deolai wards which alone had population of 52,000.

The ward formation plan prepared by the municipal corporation’s election department was presented to the three-member committee comprising divisional commissioner, district collector and municipal commissioner in the first week of January.

The committee approved the plan and the same was sent to the state election commission. The EC had asked the civic body’s election department to make certain changes in the plan and resend it.

At present, deputy municipal commissioner Kamlakar Phad is in Mumbai along with a team of officials from the municipal corporation’s election department. When asked, Phad said that the process of finalising the draft of ward formation is in final stages.

A pride march organized by Sarathi Trust on Saturday

NAGPUR: As the 2020 New Year rolled in, members of LGBTQ community are looking towards a fresh start after finally getting legal status in the country . LGBTQ members said they no longer feel like criminals in their own country. With this newfound confidence, they are gearing up to continue the fight for gay rights, and also want to raise their voice for other societal and environmental issues.

Gay rights activists said they are also social activists as there is more to their existence than just fighting for their own community. LGBTQ members in the city want to spread awareness and work for the betterment of society on the whole. The pride march organized by Sarathi Trust on January 18 in Nagpur too had the theme ‘Duties towards society’.

Anand Chandrani, a human rights and gay rights activist, said, “Every time we hit the streets and organize a march it’s not for drawing attention towards our sexual orientation. We also want to educate the society that even we have ideas, responsibilities and duties towards humanity and societal issues.”

Nikunj Joshi, CEO at Sarathi Trust, believes in the idea of gay rights activists turning into social activists, “There are so many LGBTQ members in the country working equally well for humans and society. This pride march was held to make citizens aware that we stand on equal ground, just like any straight person.”

“We had people from several human rights organization participating in the march to spread the message of humanity and welfare,” he added.

Pallavi Shimpley, a participant in the Pride Walk, and a travel enthusiast, believes that after homosexuality was legalized in the country they too want an opportunity to fulfil their responsibilities openly, “Now, our sense of responsibility has increased, which will facilitate work in the direction of abolition of any exclusion, and creating awareness about various evils in society.”

Madhura Kapre, a student and LGBTQ community member, has a strong opinion about homophobic people in society, “Until people don’t start to take us normally, they will always roll their eyes if we are contributing towards some societal work,” said Kapre. “We too feel equally sensitive towards crimes such as child abuse, rapes and exploitation.”

Hemalata Lohave, project manager at Red Cross, believes in recruiting LGBTQ members in the Red Cross projects as she feels humanity is bigger than anything, “We have so many queer and transgenders working for the betterment of sex workers and children.

143,['22/01/2020'],Delhi assembly elections: Congress picks Parvez Hashmi for Okhla,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Four-time MLA Parvez Hashmi was transport and PWD minister in Sheila Dikshit’s government

NEW DELHI: In a strategic move, which the party hopes will change political equation in Muslim-dominated Okhla assembly seat, Congress has fielded former Delhi minister and ex-Rajya Sabha MP Parvez Hashmi for the upcoming polls. Former MLA Mukesh Sharma will contest from Vikaspuri seat.

A four-time MLA, Hashmi was transport and PWD minister in Sheila Dikshit’s government between 1998 and 2003. After he was sent to Rajya Sabha by Congress in a byelection in 2009, Asif Mohammad Khan got elected from Okhla on RJD ticket. Khan, however, joined Congress before the 2013 assembly polls and won.

Sources said there was a toss-up between Hashmi and Khan that delayed the announcement of the final five candidates. The final list was out late Monday evening. “For us, winnability was the main criteria. In Okhla, both the candidates were very strong. The election committee deliberated their strengths and weaknesses in detail before picking Hashmi,” said a senior party functionary, adding that Khan’s name in an FIR for inciting violence during the anti-CAA protests probably went against him.

“We have carefully chosen our candidates and hope to win the majority,” Congress spokesperson Jitender Kochar said.

The party’s last list of five candidates included chief spokesperson and former MLA Mukesh Sharma from Vikaspuri, Parveen Rana from Bijwasan, Mohinder Chaudhary from Mehrauli and Jai Prakash Panwar from the reserved constituency of Madipur. Four seats have been given to RJD in a pre-poll seat sharing arrangement.

Sources said Sharma was tipped to be fielded from the coveted New Delhi assembly seat against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal but Congress later decided to send him to Vikaspuri, the area he was more familiar with.

Representative image

PUNE: The Chatushrungi police on Tuesday arrested a man and a woman for dumping newborn twins — a boy and a girl — near Pashan lake last week.

Police said the twins were born as a result of an illicit relationship between the suspects.

A comprising senior inspector Anil Shewale, inspector Maya Devare, and sub-inspectors Mohan Jadhav and Rakesh Sarade searched the registers and entries at all the hospitals in the city before zeroing-in on a hospital at Karvenagar, where the twins were born on January 13.

The man and the woman gave false names at the hospital and carried the babies out without permission of the hospital authorities, police said.

“The woman is a widow and has three daughters. Her husband died about four years ago. Her daughters are studying in boarding schools,” senior inspector Jadhav said.

“The woman lived alone and works as maid servant, while the man is an autorickshaw driver. He was arrested in a murder case registered with the Warje police station in 2008,” Jadhav said.

“They started staying together a couple of years ago. She conceived, but kept the pregnancy a secret. To maintain secrecy, they frequently changed their place of residence over the past 6-7 months. She never visited a doctor or nursing home for a medical check-up,” he said.

On the night of January 12, the suspects went to the Karvenagar hospital, where they gave false names and phone numbers to get the woman admitted. “The woman delivered the twins there. The next morning, without informing the hospital staff, the two left the hospital premises with the babies,” Jadhav said.

A day later, the two decided to leave the babies as they did not want anyone to know about her pregnancy. Jadhav said that they checked as many as 20 hospitals and 150 houses located in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad over the past week.

AURANGABAD: Vedantnagar police have registered a cross complaint against the contractor who had earlier filed a complaint against Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Shirsath, deputy mayor and three others for allegedly assaulting him.

“The contractor, along with five of his accomplices, have been booked for unlawful assembly, rioting, voluntarily causing hurt, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace and criminal intimidation,” said police.

According to the complaint lodged by Sunil Birare, he along with his friend, was interacting with a friend near Shirsath’s office on Saturday afternoon, when he spotted the contractor publicly using foul language against the MLA.

According to the complaint, the contractor and his accomplices allegedly assaulted Birare with an iron rod and one of the suspects allegedly assaulted Birare’s friend leaving him with head injury.

The complainant has stated that after MLA Shirsath intervened and tried to console, the suspect threatened him too.

The cross-complaint was registered within hours of the offence being registered against Shirshath, the Aurangabad west MLA, deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal and three others.

The MLA refuted the allegations and said that the contractor, who is an office-bearer of Shiv Sena, was interested in bagging a contract for works to the tune of Rs 10 crore in the Satara Deolai area, and started creating hurdles after failing to bag the contract.

A police officer said that as both the offences registered are bailable in nature, police would prefer initiating preventive action, that too after finding concrete evidence in both the complaints.

Alappuzha: The motor vehicle department (MVD) has warned of strict action against the private buses running without closing the doors in the district.

A 66-year-old man was killed at Mavelikkara on Monday after he fell on the road from a moving bus. The deceased was Chadramohan Thampi, a native of Thazhakkara, Mavelikkara. The incident took place while the fast-moving private bus was negotiating a curve.

Regional transport officer (RTO) Shibu K Itty said that he has issued directions to his officials to take strict action against drivers and conductors if they operate the buses without closing the doors. Shibu said that the license of both the driver and conductor will be suspended for six months.

“Alappuzha has 450 private buses and our patrolling team will catch the private buses violating the rules. Such buses will also be fined Rs 7,500. We have also received complaints from the public that the drivers are using mobile phones while driving and some drivers take off even before passengers disembark the buses. Our squads will check such buses and actions will be taken against them,” said an MVD officer.

Most private buses run in the town areas in Alappuzha without closing two doors, despite stringent direction from the state government.

“The MVD officials and police are not taking effective action, even private buses blatantly violate the norms throwing the safety of passenger to the wind. The private buses are running as if they are in a competition. Their action announcement can be seen only on media. We see the fight between the private bus crews in the name of timing daily. They don’t give us time to get into and get down from private buses safely. If buses are crowded, there is no safety for passengers especially school children and elderly people standing close to the door side. So, it is must to close the doors of the private buses,” said Aneesh Mohan, a youth.

AURANGABAD: Police have booked a woman, who is in her 40s, for allegedly sending objectionable pictures to her friend’s daughter following an argument with her.

Vendantnagar police have registered an offence against the woman based on the complaint registered by the 27-year-old woman. The suspect is known to the complainant’s father.

Police sub-inspector Sharda Laate said the complainant is currently pursuing higher education. “We are analysing the contents of the complaint and take necessary action,” she said.

“Between October 10, 2019 and January 11, the woman, who is allegedly in an extra-marital affair with the complainant’s father, had sent some of their objectionable photos on the latter’s WhatsApp,” she added.

Police said that since the offence was non-cognizable, all the technical data would be gathered before initiating preventive action against the suspect.

Sources said that the complainant belonged to a well-off family and was upset over her father’s objectionable picture with the woman, that were sent to her.

The police officer refused to comment as to why sections of the Information Technology Act were not invoked in the case, when the suspect reportedly used an internet-connected mobile phone for sending the pictures. As per practice, cases involving sections of the IT Act should be probed by at least an officer of the rank of inspector and above.

“The moment sections of the IT Act are invoked, it becomes a serious offence, making it mandatory for inspector rank officer to probe the case. Currently, the inspector is occupied with an offence registered against an MLA and four others including the deputy mayor,” said the officer.

PUNE: The special UAPA court will hear on January 27 a joint application moved by the nine arrested accused in the Elgar Parishad case questioning the veracity of the copies of the seized e-data.

The arrested accused have claimed that copies of the seized e-data have been provided to them without proper verification of whether hash values of the copies matched with the original data at the time of the seizure of their electronic devices.

Special UAPA judge SR Navander on Tuesday directed the state prosecution to file a written submission on the plea after the lawyers of the accused insisted that the matter needs to be settled before the process for framing of charges begins.

For the better part of Tuesday, the accused, their nominated experts and lawyers, besides the police, were busy with the verification of the e-data in the server room of the sessions court premises, as per the court’s order of January 13.

The objective was to ensure compliance of Section 207 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which says, copies of the documents the prosecution wants to rely during the trial must be provided to the accused.

In the afternoon session, the judge himself visited the server room after the accused and their lawyers raised the issue of verification of the hash values. The judge made it clear to them that the ongoing exercise was only aimed at ensuring compliance of Section 207 of CrPC and establishing authenticity of the documents would be taken up at the trial stage. This prompted the accused to go for a joint plea.

Lawyers Gaurav Jachak and Rohan Nahar, representing the accused, told TOI, “We have brought to the court’s notice that the hash algorithm values were not verified and the data have not been authenticated with the original seized electronic devices from the accused.”

The plea stated, “...the entire case is based on electronic data and the authenticity of the data with the originally seized devices as at the time of seizure must now be established... It is further prayed that cloned copies of the originally seized electronic devices with hash values of the contents of these devices at the time of seizure be provided to all the accused.”

Udupi: The beneficiaries of the government’s various social security pension schemes will receive the money at their doorsteps , even if they don’t apply for it. Government officials will keep track and let beneficiaries know they are eligible to get it. The pilot project will start in Udupi and it’ll be implemented in the state soon.

Preparations have been taking place across the district. Senior citizens, physically challenged, widows, divorced women, gender minority and others coming in pension categories under various schemes are eligible for it. Teams have been formed to work on the project and the department of revenue is taking steps to expand it around the state.

R Ashoka, minister of revenue, said: “Usually, the application for pension should taken from the taluk office and necessary documents should be submitted for the certificate of approval. Older persons, women and the disabled had to go to offices to get the pension and it’s difficult for them to avail the services. Therefore, the government planned to grant pensions. Under the Social Security Scheme, officials will go to homes of the eligible, check the records and sanction pension. Beneficiaries needn’t go to different offices for it.”

“The state has set aside Rs 75,00 crore for various pension schemes. However, mediators and ineligible beneficiaries get most of it and eligible beneficiaries get nothing. This new system can also stop pension going into the wrong hands,” he added.

Pension has been sanctioned for 3,869 persons in the district in the past three months. Of these, 1,938 pensioners have been selected by authorities. This document was submitted to the revenue department and beneficiaries selected for the pension will be issued the sanction letter in a few days. No one was chosen under Mitri Scheme.

157,['22/01/2020'],Jubilant Vizag docs hope for VIMS’ development,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Visakhapatnam: With Visakhapatnam becoming the executive capital, the medical fraternity hopes that Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences ( VIMS ) will be finally developed on the lines of Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences ( NIMS ) in Hyderabad.

Director of VIMS, Dr K Satyavaraprasad, said, “Vizag will definitely become a medical hub with patients coming from neighbouring districts and adjacent states. VIMS will be developed as an autonomous super-specialty medical institute just like NIMS. Adequate manpower would be surely recruited. In future, MCH DM (super-specialty) courses can commence in the hospital. There is no question of its being privatised.”

Despite government orders (GOs) issued last year regarding recruitment of 873 staff, including over 100 doctors , nurses, paramedics and class IV staff for VIMS, no progress was made on this front, although VIMS was officially inaugurated in April 2016.

VIMS has high-end imported equipment for complex surgeries and adequate space on a 100-acre land, but various specialties, critical care and super-specialties could not take off owing to lack of manpower across all cadres. Currently, a few departments are running with just 45 doctors on deputation basis and hardly any technical staff.

In fact, doctors hope that the overall medical infrastructure of the city will get a boost. “The government medical institutions like King George Hospital-Andhra Medical College (KGH-AMC) and other hospitals under AMC will get various facilities and preferential treatment like Osmania and Gandhi Hospital and Medical College in Hyderabad. More government hospitals might be developed as ‘Centre of Excellence,” averred Dr P V Sudhakar, principal of AMC.

158,['22/01/2020'],PCMC panel to probe Akurdi accident,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Pimpri Chinchwad: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has appointed a two-member committee to probe the reason behind the Akurdi accident, which left a woman dead on January 18.

Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar shared this information during the general body meeting of the PCMC on Monday.

The work of laying drainage and water pipelines is in progress near Akurdi railway station. Saraswati Shinde (50) of Chikhali was going with her son on a two-wheeler to meet her relatives when the vehicle slipped on the dug-up road. The impact of the accident was such that Shinde fell off the two-wheeler and died after coming under the wheels of a speeding truck.

Replying to the queries of corporators, Hardikar said, “Investigation will be conducted on how the accident occurred and who is responsible for it. We will also investigate if barricades were installed on the road or not. A two-member committee comprising additional commissioner Santosh Patil and joint city engineer Shrikant Savane will conduct the inquiry, following which a report will be submitted in three days. Strict action will be taken against the guilty person/s.”

Pimpri Chinchwad mayor Usha alias Mai Dhore presided over the meeting, during which former opposition leader Datta Sane raised the issue. “Digging of roads is in progress in various parts of the city for various works. No safety measures are taken at these sites and barricades are not installed,” he alleged.

Former mayor Rahul Jadhav said there was a need to check if the roads were being dug up after taking due permission.

159,['22/01/2020'],Congress joined Maharashtra government to keep BJP out: Ashok Chavan,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Ashok Chavan

AURANGABAD: Former chief minister Ashok Chavan of the Congress, presently PWD minister in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state, said on Monday that his party had joined the government to keep the BJP out of power.

Chavan, who arrived in Nanded on Sunday evening, headed straight to the venue where protesters were staging anti-CAA/NRC sit-in.

Addressing the gathering, Chavan said the Congress was in support of those opposing the “draconian” CAA-NRC. “Fortunately, a new government has taken the reins in Maharashtra . The Congress decided to join this government to keep the BJP out of power. Muslims too wanted that we join the government to stop the BJP from returning to power in the state,” he said.

Chavan said he had raised the citizenship issue in the state assembly too, urging the government not to implement CAA-NRC without discussion.

“At the Congress working committee meeting, Sonia Gandhi has asked party workers to launch a movement against CAA-NRC. Not just the Congress, other parties and people who believe in the Constitution are against CAA as it is against the spirit of the Constitution.”

Primarily addressing the large number of Muslims in the gathering, Chavan said, “We understand your feelings; we won’t allow social division of the country. You too must give a thought in Nanded and elsewhere before falling to anti-Congress rhetoric. This will help stop future losses. Still, whether you vote for us or not, we are with you.”

Chavan was apparently referring to his Lok Sabha loss in Nanded.

He also asked whether the Nanded MP that the Muslims had supposedly helped elect had raised any issue or talked against CAA-NRC in Parliament.

Slamming the BJP, Chavan said, “Since they have the numbers in Parliament, they are coming out with laws according to their whims. However, they require the state’s machinery to implement laws. In Maharashtra, we will not allow the implementation of the unconstitutional CAA.”

PUNE: The students of College of Agriculture Pune observed a token fast on Tuesday to protest against the alleged mistreatment by college authorities. It was only after KP Viswanatha, vice-chancellor of Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth reached the city from Rahuri and assured them about considering their demands that the students decided to end their protest.

The students have alleged mistreatment by teachers and sought their removal. They also demanded removal of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras from inside the hostel premises, opening up of library 24X7 for students, acquiring the latest books, banning the practice of renting of the college ground.

A third-year student said, “The rectors and some teachers behave badly with students. They do not respond to our queries about submission of forms or payment of scholarship. When we sought an explanation, they threatened us with loss of term or failing us in the subjects they teach. We are demanding the removal or transfer of these teachers.”

While the dean of faculty of agriculture from the university Ashok Pharande tried to meet the agitating students in the afternoon, students refused to call off their protest insisting on talking to the vice chancellor, who reached the campus in the evening.

“Students always need to be dealt with respect and understanding. Maybe, in some cases, a human touch was lacking. But I have assured them that all their justifiable demands will be considered.” said Viswanatha.

“We will look into the library issue about the lack of latest books. I have also told the dean to review all the 10 constituent colleges and meet the students so that any problem can be resolved before it flares up,” he added.

DARJEELING: The Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF), BJP’s ally in the Hills, for the first time opposed the National Register of Citizens and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Tuesday.

The GNLF had earlier refrained from clarifying its stand on the two issues but, with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee organising a rally in Darjeeling on Wednesday, the party said both NRC and CAA would affect the Gorkha community in their present form.

The GNLF also came out against the National Population Register (NPR). “The gazette notification on CAA and NPR shows that Gorkhas will be affected if both of them are implemented in their present form,” Mahendra Chhetri, spokesman of GNLF, said.

“One of the documents required to prove citizenship is parents’ the birth certificate. Not many Gorkhas have this. This will only create panic in the community,” Chhetri said.

Chhetri then rekindled the issue of putting Darjeeling under the Sixth Schedule, which he says is the only way to counter NRC and CAA.

“When CAA was passed, the Union home minister had said nothing in this section shall apply to the tribal areas of Assam , Tripura , Meghalaya and Mizoram , which are under the Sixth Schedule and covered under the Inner Line Permit. So, our party demands inclusion of Hills in the Sixth Schedule,” Chhetri said.

Keshav Raj Pokhrel, general secretary of the central committee of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (Binoy Tamang faction), however, said covering areas under the Sixth Schedule would not stop NRC from being implemented.

PUNE: The city police claimed to have solved as many as 36 cheating cases in the past one week and seized Rs14 lakh from the four persons — three attendants of a fuel refilling station in Camp involved in stealing data from debit/credit cards of customers and their handler — arrested on January 14.

The arrested petrol pump employees — Mithun Ali, Noel Shaikh and Saimuddin Ali — first inserted the cards of fuel buyers into the skimmer and then swiped them in PoS (point of sale) machines at the fuel station, police said. Zulfikar Ahmed, the other arrested person, was their handler.

The four arrested persons — all hailing from poor families at Malda in West Bengal — were lured into carrying out the act by two Delhi-based suspects on the promise of a commission of Rs20,000 each, police said.

A police team has gone to Delhi to arrest the duo. They had approached the four men in Pune about a month ago with the proposal to use skimming sensors to steal card details and note down PIN with the last four digits of the cards.

According to a preliminary estimate of the cybercrime police station, the duo based in Delhi had siphoned off money from the accounts of 60 people in the past one month.

Pune: World’s largest furniture seller Ikea aims to reach 100 million people in the coming two years, for which the company plans to invest at least 1.5 billion euros for expansion in India.

In cities like Pune, the company has taken the online route to get to customers faster. “Pune is the second market in India after Mumbai to open online first without the presence of physical stores. This is in line with the ambition to reach many more Indian customers much faster,” the company said.

Ikea did not specify its plans to open a physical store in the city though. “We are at an early stage, having launched a great online space for the many people of Pune… Meanwhile, we look forward to absorbing customer feedback and use it to continue to develop the best market approach for all cities we are entering in India,” Per Hornell, market and expansion manager, Ikea India, said.

The Swedish company has a warehouse in Chakan near Pune – its largest in India, from where it expects to serve customers with a shorter lead time. “Owing to our well-equipped distribution centre in Chakan, we are well prepared to serve our customers with a shorter delivery time of 3-5 days, depending on the products that need to be delivered,” Hornell said in an email reply.

Currently, over 2,000 people work for Ikea India and the company aims to hire close to 15,000 “co-workers” by 2025.

Trichy: Nine makeshift tiffin stalls hindering the movement of pedestrians near Teppakulam at the Main guard gate were evicted by the Srirangam zone officials of Trichy Corporation on Tuesday.

Corporation officials said that the public had complained of traffic snarls and inconvenience due to the tiffin stalls encroaching the narrow North Bank road of Teppakulam where Vanapattarai Road joins with the College Road connecting Main guard gate and Chathiram bus stand.

To prevent encroachments from recurring, the Srirangam zone officials of the civic body have fenced the retrieved space with metal bars.

While the street vendors claimed that they were not intimated in prior about the eviction drive, the civic body officials maintained that the makeshift outlets were intimated a week back about the possible eviction drive.

“Only our shops were targeted, dozens of makeshift stalls adjacent to us were not evicted,” A Jaffer, a street vendor from Teppakulam said. Corporation officials said that a litigation is preventing them from evicting the other street vendors on NSB road and in other banks of Teppakulam. “As far as the north bank of Teppakulam near Vanapattarai road, we do not have any legal hurdles in carrying out the eviction. So the encroachments were removed,” the official clarified.

Pune: A conman (27) stole the cellphone of a 28-year-old cab owner on the pretext of connecting his laptop to its hotspot and siphoned off Rs3.05 lakh from the latter’s bank account and through his credit card in August last year.

The suspect, Hrishikesh Bomble (27), foxed the cab owner, Samir Divekar of Navi Mumbai, when he had come to the city in the latter’s car for some work. Divekar had first lodged an FIR with the New Mumbai police. The case was later transferred to the Nigdi police.

Bomble was arrested from Nashik in October last year in connection with transferring Rs1.53 lakh from the bank account of a software engineer after stealing his cellphone, worth Rs84,000. Police said the same man duped Divekar. “Bomble is lodged in the Yerawada prison,” said assistant inspector Gajanan Jadhav of the Chandannagar police.

Divekar, the duped car owner, said Bomble had first hired his car in July last year. “He then hired my cab thrice and we got acquainted. When I took him to his native place in Khed in August last year, he had borrowed Rs2,100 from me. I had transferred the amount online,” Divekar said.

On August 5 last year, Bomble again hired Divekar’s cab for work at different places in Pune. “After reaching the city, he took me to a hospital for some work related to medical insurance and then he went to the PF office. He came out of the office after 15 minutes and requested me to give my cellphone because he wanted to connect his laptop to its hotspot,” Divekar said.

Divekar waited for Bomble outside the PF office till 10pm. “I went to the nearby ATM kiosk because I had run out of money but did not get cash there. After I returned home and checked with the bank, I found my debit card was blocked. Also, Rs2.75 lakh was transferred from my bank account to one Sunil Bomble’s account through net banking and Rs30,000 was transferred from my credit card to his e-wallet account,” Divekar said.

He claimed that Bomble accessed his bank account and credit card through the stolen smartphone.

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) on Tuesday initiated a drive to remove illegally put up cables and hoardings in the city.

The 2.5 km long cables put up by private parties running from City Club to Uddhavrao Patil Chowk were disconnected and confiscated by the municipal corporation’s squad. The drive continued until late in the evening on Tuesday and would continue over the next few days.

The drive comes two days after a woman riding a two-wheeler met with a fatal accident after her vehicle got stuck in a cable lying on the road.

Meanwhile, during his visit to Zone 8 on Tuesday, municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey issued a directive making it mandatory for individuals and organisations to strictly use recycled drainage water for all major construction projects.

As part of his weekly round-up of different zones in the city, Pandey visited the Itkheda and Kanchanwadi wards.

The visit included inspection of development works in Itkheda which happens to be the ward of mayor Nandkumar Ghodele.

The commissioner observed the functioning of the sewage treatment plant (STP) of the AMC in Kanchanwadi. Impressed by the functioning and capacity of the plant, Pandey instructed the officials to facilitate educational trips of AMC schools to learn about STP.

AMARAVATI: The capital region witnessed total shutdown on Tuesday following a decision by villagers to observe bandh to protest the passage of the bill facilitating three capital cities and repeal of the CRDA Act in the assembly. The farmers set copies of the bills on fire and shouted slogans against chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy and held peaceful protests across the capital city area.

The detention of TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu for over three hours in the intervening hours of Monday and Tuesday and the arrest of Guntur MP Galla Jayadev also added fuel to the fire. At Dondapadu village in Thullur mandal, unidentified miscreants set former chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy’s statue on fire. According to Guntur rural SP Ch Vijaya Rao, around six cops suffered minor injuries in the clashes. Several protesters too suffered injuries after police lathicharge

The police took Naidu into custody at the assembly after he threatened to walk from the assembly to his bungalow and kept shifting him from one place to another for hours, till he was finally allowed to go home. Jayadev, who was arrested on Monday night, was released on bail on Tuesday.

The TDP has decided to lodge a complaint with the NHRC and the Lok Sabha Speaker over the police action against Naidu and Jayadev.

TDP state wing president Kala Venkatrao said police showed utter disrespect to Naidu who served as CM for 14 years. Naidu was taken by cops through the interior roads despite knowing that he was a Z+ protectee, he alleged. Naidu was freed at around 1 am at his residence, after the assembly session ended.

Naidu said the government went ahead with the decision to move the capital city to Visakhapatnam despite his repeated requests in the assembly. “I am not scared of police action at a time when thousands of farmers and locals of Amaravati are facing much bigger harassment at the hands of police. Amaravati is a self-financing project and there’s no need to put in additional money to build it,” he said, adding that Jagan’s decision to move away from Amaravati was a conspiracy against the state and future generations. He said he would continue his battle till the government backtracks.

Meanwhile, Jayadev said he would meet the Lok Sabha speaker and lodge a complaint. “I was kept in police custody for about 14 hours. They did not even allow me medical aid. They tried to terrorise me,” he said, adding that the police also manhandled him. “You can imagine the fate of the public if the police can torture an MP.” A visibly shaken Jayadev claimed he was punched and abused by the cops. “I went to the assembly to protest against the government’s decision to move the capital out of Amaravati. The police didn’t just stop me from heading towards assembly, they punched and abused me. I still have wounds and bruises on my shoulders,” he alleged.

After his arrest, Jayadev was first taken to Narasaraopet police station, and then shifted to Thullur police station where a case was registered against him under sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 332 (causing hurt to public servant), 188 (disobeying an order given by a public servant), 354 (assaulting women), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons) and R/149 of the IPC.

Both 354 and 324 happen to be non-bailable sections. Police sources said they have collected reasonable video evidence shot through different personnel with their mobile phones which shows Jayadev “leading” the violent protests. Jayadev wasn’t kept in one police station as the cops claimed the protesters were constantly marching towards the police stations where he was being detained. Jayadev was produced at Guntur district court on Tuesday which granted him bail.

Elsewhere, TDP activists blocked traffic for some time on the busy Chennai-Bengaluru highway on Tuesday. Police had a tough time clearing the agitators and facilitating free flow of traffic on the busy stretch. At Srikalahasti, BJP and Jana Sena leaders came together to oppose the state government’s decision. They also blamed TDP for worrying more about its leaders’ landholdings rather than the plight of poor farmers who voluntarily parted with their land.

169,['22/01/2020'],Road safety awareness week fails to tackle real-time traffic issues,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Trichy: The state government’s ceremonial conduct of the road safety awareness week every year has turned out to be a farce as it is failing to solve the real-time traffic issues the commuters face each day on the city roads. While pamphlets were distributed near the Central bus stand as part of the awareness week on Tuesday, rampant traffic violations such as signal jumping happened just a few blocks away.

Local people are irked over the observance of the awareness week as the city traffic management is a shambles due to the non-functioning traffic signals, poor enforcement and lack of traffic infrastructure. The Mannarpuram traffic signal is defunct for more than five months now, and road users are in constant danger. Similarly, nobody cares about the ‘no parking’ boards installed along the arterial roads. People park their two-wheelers and cars well below the no-parking signs as there is no enforcement of the rule.

“Observing road safety awareness week is fine but what about the poor road infrastructure? There are numerous potholes on city roads. Such bad roads are equally dangerous, but no efforts were taken up to iron out such issues,” H Ghouse Baig, a resident of Khajamalai, said. U-turn is prohibited near the district court on Bharathidasan Road, but cars and even load carriers continue to violate the rule causing snarl-ups frequently.

“More than distributing awareness pamphlets, city traffic police and other stakeholders should enhance the enforcement,” T Santhanakrishnan, a resident of Srirangam, said. Local people said that the awareness week should find a solution to a real-time issue. Vehicles including buses often jump traffic signal at Major Saravanan signal near Vestry School, which is a threat to the lives of two-wheeler riders. Such violators escape unpunished. Residents blamed the absence of policemen on the one-way and the no-parking zones as a reason to such violations. “We will enhance the surveillance and enforcement on Major Saravanan signal to prevent traffic signal jumping. We will also intensify steps against the violators who park their vehicles on no-parking zones,” a traffic police official told TOI.

Pune: City-based Bank of Maharashtra (BoM) on Monday posted its fourth straight quarter of net profit, helped by expense control, even as its gross NPA inched up a bit in absolute terms.

The bank posted a net profit of Rs 135 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2019, against a loss of Rs 3,764 crore in the year-ago period. Even so, the bank’s gross advances grew a measly 4.8% against an industry average of over 7%.

“The bank has been focusing its lending to the retail, agriculture and MSME segment (which account for about 57% of bank’s loans). In the large corporate segment, the bank is lending only to top-rated corporates and is being cautious in the exposure it takes,” said AS Rajeev, managing director and CEO of Bank of Maharashtra.

He said the higher slippages (standard loans going bad) in the quarter were mainly due to two large NBFC accounts — DHFL and Religare. Except for these, he said, the slippages would have looked smaller than they do. About Rs 1,328 crore of standard loans went bad during the quarter, the bank said.

The bank reduced just about Rs 1,062 crore of bad loans in the quarter – more than half of what it could in the year-ago quarter. It has further declared Rs 4,812 crore under the special mention account category of the RBI – meaning it will have to be more watchful on these exposures.

Narendra Dabholkar

PUNE: Special UAPA judge S R Navander on Tuesday rejected the second bail plea of Vikram Bhave , who is facing trial for helping the two men accused of shooting veteran rationalist Narendra Dabholkar dead on August 20, 2013, with a recce of the murder spot, escape route and other details.

The judge orally informed the representing lawyers that the plea has been rejected on account of the applicant’s (Bhave) criminal antecedents; the fact that his name has surfaced in the present case while he was out on bail and that there is sufficient incriminating material against him in the instant case.

The court also considered the confessional statement recorded by a co-accused while rejecting Bhave’s plea. A full text of the order is to be released in due course.

“We will move the Bombay high court against the order by the Pune court,” lawyer Sameer Patwardhan, who represented Bhave, told TOI.

In August 2011, a Thane sessions court had convicted and sentenced Bhave to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in the June 4, 2008, bomb blast at Gadkari Rangayatan (theatre) in that district. Bhave was described in that case as a member of the Sanatan Sanstha. The Bombay HC admitted Bhave’s appeal against conviction and granted him bail in May 2013. He had since joined the office of Mumbai lawyer Sanjiv Punalekar as an assistant.

The CBI arrested Punalekar and Bhave on May 25, 2019, in the Dabholkar murder case on the basis of a confessional statement recorded by Sharad Kalaskar (one of the two men accused of shooting Dabholkar dead) on October 12, 2018 before a Karnataka magistrate during an SIT probe into the murder of journalist-turned-activist Gauri Lankesh in Bengaluru on September 5, 2017.

Kalaskar was arrested in the Dabholkar murder case in August 2018. He is also an accused in the Lankesh murder case.

It is the CBI’s case that Kalaskar confessed in the statement that Punalekar had in June 2018 instructed him to destroy the firearms used in the murders of Dabholkar and Lankesh. Kalaskar also confessed that Bhave had accompanied him and Sachin Andure (the other alleged shooter) for a recce of the scene of crime and showed them the escape route and the place from where they were to pick up the getaway vehicle.

Punalekar is since out on bail granted by the Pune court on July 5, 2019.

On August 17, 2019, then special UAPA judge R M Pande had rejected Bhave’s first bail plea, which was filed before submission of a chargesheet by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

Bhave moved the second bail plea after the filing of the chargesheet. He claimed that the filing of the chargesheet constituted a change in circumstance for consideration of bail relief and it (chargesheet) did not carry any incriminating material against him.

Trichy: Trichy-based Federation of Consumer Service Organisations (FCSO) has suggested constitution of ward-level committees comprising resident welfare association (RWA) members and volunteers from all the 65 wards to monitor activities of the corporation. The committees will track infrastructure development and civic issues in their respective wards and escalate the requirements to corporation officials.

Stating that the objective of the committees is to bridge the gap between residents and the civic body, FCSO members said that each committee would have 10 representatives from the respective ward.

“The committee will ensure whether good quality materials were used in the construction work,” said M Sekaran, president of the federation. Apart from monitoring the urban local body, the 65 committees comprising RWAs and NGOs will work closely with the corporation officials to carry forward people-oriented activities.

Since some wards are against the construction of micro compost centres in the particular ward, the committees will sensitise the residents about the advantages of having micro compost centres and convince them to allow its functioning.

FCSO members conducted stakeholders’ meeting near the Central bus stand on Tuesday and has planned to form committees for the remaining wards.

The school education department has already announced that for the next three years, no students will be detained even if they don't clear the board exams for Classes V and VIII.

On the delay in releasing the model question papers for the board exam, he said they would be released by the district-level examination boards under the chief educational officers.

CHENNAI: In what will bring cheer to a number of passengers at railway stations across Chennai and Tamil Nadu , Southern Railway has planned to install toilets at 200 stations.

Thirty-three of them will come up at stations in Chennai division, said railway sources. They said this was after Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) offered to fund pre-fabricated toilets using their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds.

RITES India, the engineering consultancy firm of Indian Railways, has been assigned by Railway Board to channelise the CSR fund by finalising standard drawing, layouts and tendering, the sources said.

After tenderig, RITEs has offered the contract to a Belgaum-based company which will be executing the project across stations in Tamil Nadu.

While 46 stations across Salem division will get the toilets, 55 stations each in Tiruchirapalli and Madurai division have been identified under the same scheme.

Senior railway officials say availability of toilets, their cleanliness and and maintenance are some of the important issues on which they get passenger feedback.

“This is why these parameters are also included in the yearly survey on cleanliness at stations conducted by a third party agency. Southern Railway’s rankings are steadily improving every year as we have focussed on result-based parameters while deciding our contracts as far as station cleanliness is concerned,” said senior officials.

Since last year, the Chennai division has brought in a system wherein the cleaning contractor’s payment will depend on passenger feedback.

The contractor’s representatives would be available at stations collecting feedback from around 40-50 passengers everyday on their tablets.

The passenger would have to rate the cleanliness on a scale of 1-5. “If the average rating is 4 or 5, then it is acceptable. However, if it is less than that, the contractor’s dues would be cut,” said a railway source.

In all, 30% of the contractor’s payment would be dependent on passenger feedback. This would also include regular inspections by the station officials and surprise inspections by top officials, said sources.

Indore: The plan to extend ibus service till Rau is finally taking shape. Atal Indore City Transport Services Limited (AICTSL) has pinpointed 16 locations for bus stops to be constructed between Choithram Square and Rau Circle.

Each location will have two bus stops on either side of the road as no dedicated corridor would be developed to run the buses. Thirty two bus stops will be set up on this 8-km stretch.

AICTSL officials said that bus stops would be in semi-covered shape with sliding entrance gate as well as seating space and house ticket counter as well as ATM kiosk.

Apart from bus stop structures, a dedicated bus bay would also be developed near bus stop for easy pick-up and drop of passengers.

“These bus stops would be developed with help of private agency on public private partnership (PPP) mode to avoid any financial burden,” they said.

The civic body has already invited tenders for the same and work will be started soon. “The agency will bear the entire construction cost. It will have right of advertisements on available space on stops,” added officials.

AICTSL chief executive officer Sandeep Soni said that the idea is to provide ibus connectivity to people of Rau and nearby areas.

“There would not be any dedicated corridor for ibuses on this route, only the service is being extended till Rau. We will operate buses on either sides of the road with normal traffic,” Soni told TOI.

“Our ridership has gone up by almost 100 per cent, and more buses have been proposed to be introduced on the route,” he added.

The AICTSL currently operates 42 buses on Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) corridor between Niranjanpur and Rajeev Gandhi Circle. The company had started ibus service in 2013 with 18 buses on 11.4km to cater to around 30,000 passengers.

VADODARA: Traffic movement at the Ambedkar Circle in Alkapuri will be affected for about a couple of months due to the construction of flyover between Genda Circle and Manisha Crossroads.

The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) will start construction of the span over the crossroads during this period beginning Thursday.

The Ambedkar Circle witnesses heavy traffic movement throughout the day as it is a major junction connecting Alkapuri to Subhanpura and Ellora Park towards the north and Old Padra Road towards the south.

While traffic will continue to ply on the service roads, vehicles will not be able to cross the junction.

Due to the traffic restriction at the junction, vehicles coming from the Alkapuri side will not be able to go towards Subhanpura and Ellora Park.

They will instead have to go towards Chakli Circle and take a ‘U’ turn. Similarly, traffic from Chakli Circle towards Alkapuri will have to go till the Trident Circle and take a ‘U’ turn.

The traffic from Chakli Circle comprises vehicles coming from both Old Padra Road and Gotri Road.

VMC’s in-charge city engineer, P M Patel said, that unlike other junctions, work on the Ambedkar Circle will take more time as a slab will have to be made for connection at the crossroads.

“The span is around 45 meters long and it will not be possible to place prefabricated girders using cranes unlike it had been done at the other junctions,” Patel said.

Sources in the civic body said that measures will be taken to ensure that the idol of Dr B R Ambedkar at the junction is not damaged during the construction work.

Teams are currently making efforts to nab a jeweller from Buldhana apart from accomplices hailing from different places including Nanded. “The suspects we now want are the ones who have played a role in dispersing the stolen booty,” said an officer. The police have already frozen the bank account of one of Sikandar’s the wives after he deposited Rs 14 lakh in to her bank account.

Pundaliknagar police station in-charge and assistant inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne said, “Despite the accused being hardened criminals, we are confident of recovering the stolen booty.”

SOCIAL INITIATIVE: Sri Vidyadheesha Teertha Swamiji of Sri Palimaru Math flanked by V Ravichandran of Diya Sys... Read More

Mangaluru: Having finished his paryaya tenure on Saturday, Sri Vidyadheesha Teertha Swami of Sri Palimaru Math on Tuesday announced his intent to focus on two areas that he could not focus on in the last 2 years heading the Sarvajna peetha. These are education of students and healthcare needs of people from economically backward sections of society. The Palimaru math could only pay lip service to these areas in the last two years, he said.

To fund these activities, the math has proposed to construct a new community centre near Sri Guru Raghavendra Swami Math at Kavoor. Sri Vidyadheesha Teertha will perform bhoomi puja for the project being taken up at an estimated cost of Rs 3.5 crore during the auspicious kumba lagna muhurtha at 8.15am on February 7. The seer said the project will have a built up space of around 8,000 sq ft and will be completed in one year.

Giving details of the project during his maiden visit to Sri Guru Raghavendra Swami Math, which is now a unit of the Palimaru Math, Sri Vidyadheesha Teertha said he could not come to the math when its kumbhabhisheka was held in May 2019 due to his paryaya duties. “It is my intent now to take up the hall project and use a portion of revenue earned from it to fund the education and healthcare needs of the underprivileged,” he said.

The project received a fillip with Vidya Ravichandran, president, Diya Systems, donating six cents for the hall, and the Guru Raghavendra Swami Math will utilise the four cents abutting this donated land to construct the community hall. “It will be my intent to allow the economically weaker sections of society to use the hall for free, and the well-to-do will be charged maintenance expenses required to run the hall,” the seer said.

Exuding confidence that the devotees of the math and philanthropists will help see the hall project through, the seer said he will not seek government funds which does not materialise when needed. “We will strive to tap into CSR funds that companies may be willing to apportion,” he said.

Palimaru Math met the health needs of around six villagers abutting the math through its Sanjeevini mobile clinic and Dhanavanthari health scheme in the last two years.

PUNE: A three-year-old girl died after being run over by a speeding Shivshahi bus at Loni Devkar near Indapur on the Pune-Solapur highway on Tuesday morning.

Police said the toddler, Riya Premkumar Gautam, ended up on the highway while playing and was mowed down by the bus driver, who failed to spot her. The Indapur police have booked the driver on the charges of rash and negligent driving.

“The girl was playing alone in front of her house, which is at a distance of few metres from the Pune-Solapur highway. Engrossed in the game, she wandered off to the busy highway around 8am on Tuesday ,” an officer from the Indapur police said.

The officer said as soon as the girl reached the highway, the speeding Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation’s (MSRTC) Shivshahi bus arrived. “The driver did not notice the girl and ran over her,” he said.

The hirl’s mother was busy with household chores and her father had gone to work at the time of the accident , the police said.

“The girl’s family is from Uttar Pradesh and had migrated to Pune three years ago in search of work. Her father works in a small company in the MIDC area,” the officer said.

The accident occurred a day after a 25-year-old woman pillion rider died and her husband suffered injuries after their motorcycle was hit by an MSRTC-owned Shivneri bus near Wakad bridge.

The bus driver, who fled the spot after the accident, was booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code by the Hinjewaji police.

The court suo motu took cognizance of the issue startled over six ‘original’ identity cards

CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Tuesday said it would, if needed, constitute a special committee to identify fake journalists in the state.

“Many persons claiming to be journalists are said to have been committing crimes and blackmailing business people and government officials. If this court is convinced, it will constitute a special committee to look into the circulation of those magazines as well as newspapers, income tax paid by those persons from the date of their first publication, and the properties, assets and liabilities possessed by them to know as to whether they are genuine presspersons or not and their assets are in consonance with their known sources of income,” a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice P Velmurugan said.

The bench also suo motu impleaded the Audit Bureau of Circulation as respondent since the circulation details of the newspapers and magazines could be given only by it.

The court suo motu took cognizance of the issue startled over six ‘original’ identity cards, issued by the state information and public relationship department, that a PIL petitioner produced to prove that he was a ‘genuine’ journalist.

The PIL was moved by S Sekaran, who claimed to be a freelance journalist. He wanted the court to initiate action against retired IPS officer Pon Manickavel for allegedly providing false information to the court while he was acting as a special officer of Idol Wing CID.

When counsel for Manickavel questioned the petitioner’s credentials as journalist, Sekaran produced six identity cards issued by the state government.

The court also directed the authorities to report the number of cases registered against fake journalists for criminal activities and the status of such cases, details of members of the accreditation committee and the media organisation they belong to, on what basis such members are selected, and why the state should not consider establishing a statutory body like Press Council of India to take action against errant members.

When the plea came up for hearing, the public prosecutor submitted that there were a number of cases filed against fake press people and the details had been collected from various districts and sought time to file a report.

This apart, five other city-based journalists impleaded themselves in the plea to assist the court in identifying such fake mediapersons. Recording the same, the bench adjourned the hearing to February 5.

INDORE: Minister Jitu Patwari and BJP MP Mahendra Singh Solanki entered into heated argument at a meeting of District Planning Committee, Dewas on Tuesday.

Things got so heated that Patwari threatened to send Solanki out of the meeting and the BJP leader shot back that Jitu will never be a minister again.

The DPC meeting, to review development projects in Dewas, got into trouble from the word ‘go’. Solanki raised objection to the seating arrangement and expressed displeasure over Dewas Congress president Manoj Rajani taking part as a ‘representative’ of PWD minister Sajjan Singh Verma, the Sonkatch MLA.

As the meeting proceeded, the BJP MP alleged that local bureaucrats were “working under pressure of Congress leaders” and targeting BJP workers during demolition drives. Solanki accused the district collector of not taking action against a company, believed to be owned by a Congress leader, for encroaching upon government land.

Furious, Rajani protested Solanki’s accusations and asked him not to make personal remarks. Tension shot up as Congress workers present in the hall started shouting at the MP. Soon, Patwari and Solanki got into a squabble.

Taking a dig at Solanki, Patwari said, “You have become MP in (Narendra) Modi’s wave. But developing your own personality is your personal responsibility. Your way of talking is not right. I can send you outside this room.”

An agitated Solanki retorted: “It’s my claim that you will not become minister next time”.

Patwari shot back, “An MP is a public representative. Solanki has insulted me publicly. He will be taught a lesson at the right time. The message should go out to voters of Dewas Lok Sabha constituency.”

Talking to mediapersons after the meeting, Solanki alleged that all the ministers of the state government were involved in corruption under the garb of taking action against mafia, while Patwari criticized the MP for “indecent behaviour”.

Jaipur: Over 100 species vanish from the earth every day. India is home to 22 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities. The loss of bio-diversity is menacingly rapid. The fears of climate change causing large-scale havoc have become a painful reality.

When the World Wilderness Congress ( WWC ) holds its week-long conference in Jaipur in March this year, conservation professionals, scientists, business and financial leaders, artists, community activists, land managers, and thought influencers will brainstorm on practical and positive solutions to the dual existential threats of extinction and climate breakdown.

“We need not forget that human beings are also a species. That’s why we advance an urgent agenda, one that manifests a new relationship with nature and allows people to respectfully share the earth with wildlife and wild places, for the benefit of all life. Nature needs half,” said Vance Martin, global president of WWC, here on Tuesday. WWC is the longest-running, public environmental forum to build awareness and support for wilderness, and strengthen wilderness policy from grassroots decision-making to national policy.

For the Jaipur congress, which the 11th in its 40-year history, WWC is expecting 1,500 delegates from 60 nations, including president of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa, Hollywood actor Shannon Alexander, ambassador for the United Nations Convention on Migratory Species Stanley Johnson, among others.

Co-organised by the Rajasthan government, Wilderness Foundation Global, WILD Foundation and Sanctuary Nature Foundation, WWC will also be attended by forest and tourism department officials from various states to explore new ways of sustainable livelihood, said Sunil Mehta, managing director (hon.), India, WWC.

As the Congress seeks to promote a global deal for ‘Nature Needs Half’ world through protection, restoration and ‘rewilding’, it also seeks to draw synergy from indigenous and modern approaches. Chairman of Wild Foundation Global Todani Moyo said, “Building partnerships between traditional, modern and indigenous communities to create community-based strategies for conserving nature is an important objective.”

Speaking about WWC’s global programmes that will amplify urgent calls to protect half the planet, Martin said the Jaipur congress will launch a BRICS-based (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) leadership committee and in-country social movements to influence policy agendas in some of the world’s largest and most bio-diverse countries. He said these countries are among the top 10 bio-diversity rich places in the world and are home to two-thirds of the global population.

Vadodara: A four-member team from Gujarat’s health department including Dr Rajesh Patel, chief medical officer of the state nodal cell for state’s health insurance scheme, Mukhyamantri Amrutam (MA) yojana, visited city-based Premadas Jalaram Hospital on Tuesday.

The hospital located on Harni-Warasiya Road was recently in the news for botching up medical reports of kidney patients who come at the hospital for dialysis.

After reports of the alleged negligence, the state health department had last week suspended the hospital’s affiliation for the MA yojana. “If any discrepancy is found in the audit, we visit the hospital. This too is a routine visit meant to inspect infrastructure facilities, medical records and HR inspection,” said Patel.

Patel confirmed that there were some discrepancies that came to the notice of the team. “We have issued necessary directives to the hospital so that they take corrective action,” he said.

He said that there were reports of patients getting hepatitis c virus (HCV) infection which decreases immunity of patients. “We have to ensure that the situation does not aggravate,” he said.

While the dialysis facility at the hospital has been suspended for now, the officials said beneficiaries from poor families can continue taking benefit of the MA scheme from other private hospitals in the city.

NAGAPATTINAM: Farmers in the delta districts will stage a protest on January 27 against the Union government’s recent amendment to the Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2006 exempting hydrocarbon projects, stating that it would affect farming and their lives.

Union environment ministry has exempted hydrocarbon exploration activities from the rigours of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and public consultation through public hearings.

It was issued in response to a request for exemption from the public hearing by companies , including Vedanta Ltd, whose proposal to explore for hydrocarbons in the Cauvery delta has been met with severe public opposition.

While condemning the notification issued by the Union government, the chief coordinator of the Anti-Methane Project Movement, T Jayaraman, said that they would not allow any companies to explore hydrocarbon in the delta and they would carry out a series of protests from January 27. Protests would be held at various places across the delta districts, he said.

Speaking at a meeting held at Mayiladuthurai in Nagapattinam district, Jayaraman said that no project should be executed in the country without taking the consent of the people residing at the particular area. This was a clear indication that the Union government is safeguarding corporates, which have been decided to explore oil and natural gas from the delta, he alleged.

“They have moved their focus from the delta to sea, which would affect both the terrains as well as the resources in the ocean. To show a stiff resistant, the Anti-Methane Project Movement has decided to hold massive protests at various places across the delta including Mayiladuthurai, Thanjavur , Tiruvarur, Mannargudi, Vedaranyam, Puducherry, Karaikal and Cuddalore in the first phase,” he added.

Members of the group during a meet of the organisation

CHENNAI: They call themselves the ‘Middle class group’ or Madhyamar simply because they believe that’s just who they are – a group of middle class individuals from all walks of life who have come together to make a difference.

What began as a motley group of 10-12 people airing their views on social media has in two years grown into a Tamil Facebook group of more than 23,000 people – doctors, teachers, autorickshaw drivers, homemakers (around 40% of the group), those in government sector and so on.

“The rich are, well, rich. The economically weak get their subsidies and their grants. But the middle class, we’re left to fend for ourselves. We set up this forum to help each other out, and learn from each other,” says Swaminathan Ramasubramaniam, an IT professional and member of the group.

The name Madhyamar, he says, was made popular by writer Sujatha and members decided it was perfect for them.

Apart from an annual meet and greet (this year’s was held last week) every week a topic is put out on the group’s Facebook page.

“Topics range from budgeting in a middle class family to getting kids into college, issues that are top of mind for the middle class. People offer solutions based on their life experiences. We also highlight people from the middle class who are making a difference in society,” says Madhyamar founder Shankar Rajarathnam , adding the average age of group members is 45.

Last year, the group also started a web channel, which regularly features episodes roping in experts from fields like personal finance, insurance, and the travel industries to speak on issues pertinent to the community.

“Members would send their list of questions a few weeks in advance to us so experts could answer their queries. During the Lok Sabha elections, for instance, we had former chief election commissioner T S Krishnamoorthy, while heritage expert V Sriram had a session with us during the Madras week celebrations,” says Swaminathan.

The group has also begun working towards charitable causes. “We recently constructed two classrooms for a corporation school in Sirugalathur, a hamlet near Kundrathur . We are also working with a school near Keezh Venmani, another village. Our members also get involved in activities like cleaning and painting temples and schools,” he says.

Vijayawada: After cockfights were banned in 2016, there was a steady increase in the number of cases registered against the prevalence of the blood sport in Krishna district, until recently. The drop in the number of cases registered has been drastic this Sankranti.

During the corresponding period in 2019, Krishna district alone filed 914 cases against those organising cockfights. In 2018 in both Vijayawada and Krishna district, the number of cases spiked by 250 per cent with 1,045 cases being registered.

Interestingly, the figures for 2020 show an inexplicable drop in the number of cases registered — 60 per cent.

The number of people arrested too has dropped by almost 60 per cent.

Police personnel TOI spoke to maintained that the sharp decline was due to the effective preventive action taken in ensuring cockfights didn’t take place.

Around 200 habitual organisers were bound over under Section 106 of CrPC towards the respective tahsildar’s offices. They also cited that they have changed the strategy this time that they had targeted blacksmiths who manufacture and sell cockfighting knives to the organisers of the blood sport.

However, massive cockfighting events were organised with full media coverage at Nuzvid, Gudivada and Avanigadda regions which on all three days of Sambaralu.

And bound over cases were filed even back in 2018 and 2019 as well as a precautionary measure. Sources admitted that many events did take place discreetly in areas such as Nandigama, Jaggaiahpet and other places with local political support.

Apart from cockfight rackets, cops also cracked down on other gambling rackets such as ‘kotha mukka’ and ‘matka’ card games and recovered more cash this year. In Vijayawada, they seized Rs 4.4 lakh and registered 13 cases against 87 people.

Krishna district police unit registered 173 cases against 523 persons and seized Rs 10.1 lakh from them. Regardless of the enforcement, the bloodsport did take place unabated in suburban regions of Yanamalakuduru, Pedapulipaka and Edupugallu.

Trichy: A 20-year-old college student was injured while two other students had a narrow escape after a fall from an overcrowded TNSTC bus on Tuesday morning near Lalgudi. The students fell from TNSTC bus 93E from Pullambadi after the foot-board at the rear side broke while on the move.

J Manikandan, a second year undergraduate student of government arts and science college, Lalgudi, sustained deep wounds on his knees. He was rushed to the hospital and administered sutures while the two other students sustained minor injuries as they managed to cling on to the bus as the foot-board broke. However, TNSTC officials washed their hands of the matter and blamed the students for travelling on foot-board in the crowded bus. Students however say it was the only bus operated on the route on Tuesday instead of three on other days.

As the college is located in a remote village, TNSTC has been operating special buses — four from Lalgudi and three from Pullambadi — for the students. With 1,200-odd students in the college, many take the bus to reach college in the morning. “The bus was jam-packed because only one bus was operated from Pullambadi instead of three. Since students didn’t want to be late to college, they had to travel on foot-board,” said S Rajadurai, a student.

A senior official of Lalgudi TNSTC depot said that one of the two buses from the depot was late but the service was not stopped. “Instead of waiting for the bus, students chose to cling on to the crowded one which eventually led to the mishap,” said the official. As soon as the bus reached the college after the incident, students staged a sit-in protest in front of it seeking additional bus service to the college. A team of TNSTC officials led by the Lalgudi branch manager held talks with the students and promised to take steps to increase bus services to the college. Following the assurance, the students called off their protest.

Thanjavur: The paddy procurement target for the current samba season has been fixed at 25 lakh tonnes, food minister R Kamaraj said at the tripartite meeting held on Tuesday. The previous year it was 19.1 lakh tonnes, the minister added.

“Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) had set up 1,766 direct procurement centres (DPCs) last year, through which 19.1 lakh tonne paddy was procured from 5.06 lakh farmers.

Amaravati: The decision of Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC) to postpone the Group-I examination has left candidates in shock.

This is second time the Public Service Commission has rescheduled the examination within two months.

APPSC secretary and senior IPS officer PSR Anjaneyulu said the commission has decided to postpone the examinations scheduled on February 4 on administrative grounds.

He, however, said the revised schedule would be announced on January 27.

Sources said that the commission took the decision following advice from the top brass in the government. Sources said that the state government has been providing free coaching to the scheduled caste, backward classes, Kapu and minority students by roping in expert coaching institutions in private sector.

While welfare corporations of respective communities have been spending money for free-coaching, the training institutions were making big money. Sources said that the coaching institutions have commenced the classes for Group-I on January 11 due to the delay in getting clearances from the government. This prompted students to seek the postponement citing shortage of time to complete coaching.

However, many candidates are worried that repeated rescheduling would adversely impact their preparation. With civil services prelims is scheduled to be held on May 31, the students are demanding that the APPSC should complete the process early.

“There is a lot of difference on how candidates prepare for a prelims examination which is objective and mains examination which is written subjective. We request the Public Service Commission to hold Group-I mains examination as early as possible (at least before the first week of March) so that we could get at least two months to prepare for civil services prelims examination,” said Sarathbabu, an aspirant.

Vadodara: A controversy has been raked up over the Gujarat Housing Board’s (GHB) decision to ask Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) to declare old houses built two decades ago as dangerous looking at their dilapidated condition.

While writing to the VMC, the board stated that even it was conducting structural stability audit of these houses. The houses in contention were constructed around 25 to 30 years back. The board itself has issued notices to those occupying these run-down houses.

VMC opposition Rashtriya Saman Paksha (RSP) leader Rajesh Ayre, in whose ward hundreds of such houses exist, stated that it seemed that the GHB was eyeing to redevelop the residential colonies on a public-private partnership mode. He said that similar development was taken up by the VMC even earlier, under different housing schemes.

Ayre has asked the municipal commissioner to ensure that the civic body does not become a party to the housing board’s move to benefit realtors. He threatened to conduct an agitation if the VMC took the step of ousting residents of the housing board colonies.

Ayre also pointed out that several houses were maintained by the residents there and were not in a bad shape.

VMC itself is, however, treading cautiously on the issue.

Sources said that it has decided to seek reports on stability from GHB before issuing notices to the residents of these houses declaring them as dangerous. Also, the civic body feels that it would be a mammoth task to conduct a survey of thousands of such houses in the city to check their condition.

CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Tuesday directed demolition of a luxury bungalow built in violation of coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms at Akkarai on the East Coast Road (ECR).

A division bench of Justices M Sathyanarayanan and R Hemalatha also directed the authorities to disconnect electricity and water connections to five other bungalows, which were also built in violation of CRZ norms in the same area. The bench also directed the city police to provide appropriate protection to carry out the demolition.

The issue pertains to a batch of pleas moved by owners of 138 such bungalows, including celebrities and high-profile businessmen, challenging notices issued by Chennai corporation in connection with the alleged violations. The owners wanted the court to direct the authorities to consider re-classification of Akkarai and Sholinganallur villages on ECR, which were declared no-development zones under CRZ-II guidelines.

The primary allegation was that all such bungalows were constructed within 500 metres of the high tide line. Inspections made by authorities revealed that about 50 of them were constructed within 200 metres of the high tide line.

The court summoned three senior secretaries of the state government and the commissioner of the Chennai Corporation to explain rampant violation of CRZ norms. The court also imposed Rs 25,000 each as cost on CMDA and Chennai corporation for abdicating their duties.

Murugan, a resident of the area, had also moved a PIL urging the court to order removal of rocks illegally dumped in front of such buildings to prevent entry of sea water and demolition of all such illegally constructed bungalows.

At the hearing on Tuesday, inspection reports filed by various departments including the PWD and directorate of town planning said all such bungalows have been constructed in no-development zone in clear violation of CRZ regulations. They further added that the structures had no building or plan approval from the appropriate authority or even environment clearance from the Centre.

As officials were a little relieved after noticing that the locusts have been contained in Sriganganagar district and its affected areas, fresh activity of swarms of locusts was seen.

More than 100 officials of LCO, Jodhpur, are camping in the 10 locust-affected districts and are in touch with the local farmers, officials of agriculture department, revenue department and others.

While on Tuesday officials engaged in the locust control were a little relieved as locust activity was merely in scattered form, they were made aware on the fresh spotting of swarms of locusts near Ramgarh area of Jaisalmer and on the Jalore-Barmer border near Tanot.

“As far as Sriganganagar is concerned, 95 percent locusts are contained. The scattered activity of locusts was confined to the areas including Bakuwala border and near Faridsar outpost in Raisinghnagar tehsil of Sriganganagar,” said Dr K L Gurjar, deputy director, LCO, Jodhpur, told TOI over phone from Sriganganagar.

He confirmed that fresh activity of locust was seen in the border districts including some parts of Jaisalmer, Barmer and a few portions of Jalore district. “Our teams are coordinating with the local authorities of agriculture, revenue and other departments to control the activities. With the help of locals spray of pesticide was organised at a few places in Jaisalmer and Jalore,” said a senior officer of LCO.

Meanwhile, at a few places in Sriganganagar, Jalore, Jaisalmer and Barmer the girdawari of the crops has been initiated by the authorities while at a few places the farmers have also been given compensation.

“Prolonged locust activity has been strange this year so far. As I have already said that Pakistan did not pay heed while he had clearly stated that they should contain the hoppers during our meeting on December 4 , 2019,” Gurjar added.

On the scarcity of the pesticide, Gurjar said, “There is no scarcity as we have ample stock which has been distributed in the districts where fresh attack has been witnessed.”

An elephant died on getting electrocuted near Palamaner in Chittoor in the early hours of Tuesday.

According to divisional forest officer (Chittoor West) D Sunil Reddy, a tusker , aged around 20 years, died after it came in contact with an electric pole at an agricultural field in Tekumanda village of Palamaner constituency in Chittoor district. “One of the elephants in a herd walked into an electric pole which broke into half and in the process, the elephant sustained an electric shock and succumbed on the spot,” the DFO said.

Local sources said a herd of elephants which ventured out of Koundinya Reserve Forests damaged crops near Tekumanda on Monday. Following the tusker’s attack on farmlands, forest department personnel along with trackers burst crackers to drive back the jumbos into the woods. It was in this process that a tusker which got separated from its herd and was rushing back to rejoin them hit the electric pole. Four tuskers died of electrocution in separate incidents at the reserve forests in 2019 which is home to 42 Asiatic elephants as per records from the same year.

The investigators are also likely to submit the charge sheet in the case on Wednesday

VADODARA: The city police on Tuesday submitted a report in a special POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) court to add a section of death penalty as prescribed in the amended POCSO Act in the Navlakhi gang rape case too.

The investigators are also likely to submit the charge sheet in the case on Wednesday.

The investigating officer gave a report to the court requesting addition of section 6(1) of the POCSO Act and section 394 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for causing hurt to commit robbery in the original FIR .

The court was also requested to remove sections 325 (causing grievous hurt) and 376D (gang rape) of the IPC from the FIR. The police said that evidence for section 325 were not found while the section of gang rape is not relevant in this case. The FIR already has section 376DA gang rape on woman under 16 years of age.

On receiving the report, the advocate of the two accused – Jaso Solanki and Kishan Mathasuriya – requested the court to give him time to file a reply. “The court considered my request and I will file my written reply to the report on Wednesday,” said the duo’s advocate Alpesh Chauhan.

The special public prosecutor in the case Pravin Thakkar said, “The charge sheet is ready and it will be submitted along with the ‘muddamaal’ on Wednesday.”

The ‘muddamaal’ or the material evidence is with Raopura police where the case was originally registered.

In the past as investigation had progressed, police had twice requested the court to add different sections. The sections for repeated rape on the same woman, committing rape on a woman under 16 years of age, assault and other offences were added later on.

CHENNAI: A Class IX student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, HVF Avadi, slipped down a flight of stairs at the school and died on Monday, police said.

Police identified the deceased teenager as 14-year-old Gourav Naveen Sanniboyina , a resident of Poompozhil Nagar in Avadi. Witnesses told police that the accident occurred in the afternoon, during the lunch break,when Gourav Naveen was climbing up to his classroom on the second floor of the school building, playfully hopping on one leg and skipping one step at a time.

In the process, he landed on the edge of one of the steps and slipped. His head smashed against the wall and he collapsed. A few students at the spot alerted some teachers who informed the principal.

Gaurav Naveen was rushed to the hospital on the Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF) premises where doctors found his pulse rate reducing drastically and suggested that the school management take him to a corporate hospital. The boy was shifted to the Shri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute (SRMC & RI) in Porur where doctors declared him dead on arrival.

Police said the boy had suffered a serious injury to the forehead that would have led to a haemorrhage in the brain and subsequent death. There was no other injury on the body, a police officer said. The school authorities informed Naveen’s family members and they rushed to the hospital. The boy’s body was handed over to the family on Tuesday after an autposy was performed at the hospital.

On Monday, soon after receiving the information, a team of the Avadi Tank Factory police led by inspector Natarajan visited the school premises and examined the place where the boy had fallen to his death. Police personnel made inquiries with some of the students and school staff who witnessed the accident and those who were the first to rush to the boy’s side.The investigation officers said there was nothing suspicious about the boy’s death. Further inquiries are on.

Naveen’s father Durgalu Sanniboyina, a junior works manager at the HVF, also didn’t mention about any foul-play in his boy’s death, the police officer said.

Representative image

TRICHY: The Chief Education Office of Trichy district will be the first district in the state to sensitise school heads on identifying gender non-conformed children.

On Tuesday, over 100 government school headmasters from the district were educated on gender non-conforming children and asked to identify such children in their respective schools for early intervention.

Gender non-conformed children can be easily identified in their adolescence, though hormonal imbalance begins as early as 5, said major general (retd) NRK Babu , correspondent of Sri Sivananda Balalaya (SSB) school, Adavathur, and key resource person for the session.

“We know that children are going to the streets. But when they are in schools, they either camouflage it or they are ignored. Often the school does not take notice of the issue over lack of awareness. Since most parents do not open up, we want schools to identify them so that their parents can be informed that there is an option,” he said.

Explaining the reason behind the move, he said parents of such children are often left with only two options - either keep them at home or disown them over societal pressure.

Babu said that statistics show that more than 80% of such children are abandoned by parents at a tender age. If teachers and heads of schools are aware, such children can be identified and parents can be counselled that there is a way to save the child. Once they are on the road, it is difficult to bring them back,” he added.

The teachers were asked not to overlook gender non-conforming children apart from preventing them from getting bullied. “All this effort is to ensure that parents don’t disown their child. Once we have the support of parents, we can save the child,” said Babu.

The district social welfare department in association with the chief education office came together to take up the awareness programme at the collector’s office and is expected to cover about 600 schools in the next two days.

JODHPUR: The state government has assured the Rajasthan High Court to fill all vacant posts in district consumer forums and State Consumer Commission by February 10 . The assurance came after the HC came down heavily on the government.

222,['22/01/2020'],Cong gears up for Rahul’s anti-CAA rally on Jan 28,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Jaipur: The Congress leaders in Rajasthan are gearing up to give a rousing reception to former party president Rahul Gandhi on his arrival here on January 28 to address a grand rally against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and to highlight the failures of the NDA government at the Centre. On Tuesday, chief minister Ashok Gehlot, deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, AICC general secretary Avinash Pande along with several ministers reviewed arrangements for the rally. Ram Niwas Bagh and Vidhyadhar Nagar stadium are the two venues under consideration for the rally.

Speaking to media, deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot said, “Rahul will kick-off a series of anti-Narendra Modi government rallies from here. The CWC has asked Rahul to tour the country and address people on the anti-people policies of the NDA government.”

Pilot said Rahul’s rally in Jaipur is important as it comes just a few days before the Union budget. The Congress wants to force the Centre to take some corrective measures on the economy in the budget and provide relief to the people, he said.

Pilot said the Centre’s wrong policies had wreaked havoc with the economy and youths are on the streets. There is all round resentment against the Modi government. The students in universities and campuses are on the streets as they are faced with a bleak future. To divert attention from its failures, the Union government had passed contentious laws like CAA which ignited strong protest from all over the country, he said.

He said it is for the first time in recent times a Central legislation has become such a bone of contention between the Centre and states and being resisted by the people.

Responding to a question on implementing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) by the state government, he said,""We believe that the law has been passed in Parliament on the basis of majority, but whether it will meet the legal standards will be decided by the Supreme Court.""

Pilot said any legislative assembly is free to pass a resolution.

He said the Congress party believes that the CAA is against the basic spirit of the Constitution. Deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot said a meeting of the ministers, MLAs, MPs, party candidates who had contested in the assembly and Parliament elections and PCC office bearers will be held on January 23 at 11 am to make the rally of Rahul Gandhi a grand success.

223,['22/01/2020'],Post of party chief most fulfilling experience: Pilot,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Jaipur: PCC president Sachin Pilot , who completed six years as the party state chief on Tuesday, said it was the most challenging and fulfilling assignment in his around two-decade-long stint in politics.

“I became MP and minister at a very young age. The post of party chief has been a fulfilling experience,” he said.

“During the last six years, I had travelled through the length and breadth of the state. I have stayed in 400 blocks which helped me to establish a connect with party workers and expand the party base,” he said while interacting with reporters.

Pilot said when he took over the mantle, the morale of the party workers was low. The Congress was trounced in the assembly polls with its tally reduced to just 21 MLAs. At the Centre, Narendra Modi became the prime minister and Vasundhara Raje was back at the helm of affairs in the state.

He said with the support of party workers and leaders, he took to the streets taking up the causes of people and the struggle had paid off.

Pilot said he would continue to speak for the people. “We are in power, but there is no compromise of issue-based politics,” he said. “One year now we are in power and we will ensure that all the promises made to the people are implemented,” he said.

On the blame game on the delay in holding panchayat elections between panchayat department and the state election commission, he said the poll panel is a constitutional body created to conduct elections on time in panchayat bodies and he had the highest regard for the institution.

He claimed that his department conducted the delimitation of panchayats in a very transparent way. He repeated the argument that after Supreme Court stayed the high court order on delimitation of panchayats, the commission should conduct the polls on time to the remaining panchayat bodies whose term come to an end on February.

Vadodara/ Anand: Rakesh Patel, husband of murdered NRI woman Heeral Patel, was found dead in Canada. The duo had their roots in Gujarat’s Anand district.

Rakesh was the prime suspect in the murder case of his 28-year-old wife Heeral, who hailed from Pamol village in Borsad taluka in Anand district. She was found dead in Brampton city of Canada last week.

Peel police had issued a Canada-wide arrest warrant for Rakesh on charges of first-degree murder after Heeral’s body was found in a wooded area in Brampton after she had gone missing on January 11.

Going by the reports in Toronto, the local police on Monday confirmed that the cops had found 36-year-old Rakesh last Friday near a hydro tower in Etobicoke area. Sources said the body was found hanging, though the cops have not confirmed the report. Rakesh’s 2009 model Honda civic car was found parked near a casino.

Heeral had married Rakesh from Kinkhlod village, also located in Borsad, in 2013. She settled in Canada with her in-laws, while her brother Vinay Patel and a cousin too live in Canada.

Of late, Heeral was having strained relations with her husband and her in-laws. The couple had eventually decided to file for divorce and the formalities for ending the marriage started a couple of months back.

Although not much details are known about the condition of Rakesh’s body, Heeral’s family members had claimed that her body bore injury marks. The deceased’s family members had been claiming that a relative of Rakesh, based in the US, had once threatened that he could get her killed.

File photo

AURANGABAD: A video of Maharashtra minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan purportedly saying that his party joined the Shiv Sena-led government on “insistence” of the “Muslim community” to stop BJP from returning to power has gone viral on social media.

The remarks were purportedly made by the PWD minister while addressing an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) rally in Nanded in Marathwada region of the state recently.

Chavan, however, said on Tuesday that he didn’t specifically mention Muslims in his speech.

“We have a (coalition) government in place in the state. Congress decided to join the government to avoid the (repeat of) losses the state had suffered in the last five years (when BJP was in power). Our Muslim brothers also insisted that we join the government to keep the biggest enemy, BJP, away from power,” Chavan said.

Chavan, who arrived in Nanded on Sunday evening, headed straight to the venue where protesters were staging an anti-CAA/NRC sit-in.

Chavan said he had raised the citizenship issue in the state assembly too, urging the government not to implement CAA-NRC without discussion. “At the Congress Working Committee meeting, Sonia Gandhi has asked party workers to launch a movement against CAA-NRC. Not just Congress, other parties and people who believe in the Constitution are against CAA as it is against the spirit of the Constitution.”

Primarily addressing the large number of Muslims in the gathering, Chavan said, “We understand your feelings; we won’t allow social division of the country. You too must give a thought in Nanded and elsewhere before falling to anti-Congress rhetoric.”

Slamming BJP, Chavan said, “Since they have the numbers in Parliament, they are coming out with laws according to their whims. However, they require the state’s machinery to implement laws. In Maharashtra, we will not allow the implementation of the unconstitutional CAA.”

230,['22/01/2020'],Periyar may help Rajinikanth launch himself in Tamil Nadu politics,"CHENNAI: For once, Rajinikanth has stood his ground. By refusing to apologise for his statement about Periyar’s Salem rally in 1971, he seems to have found a path to take forward his ‘spiritual politics’.And, in the process, the superstar seems to have put the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) and the DMK on a tricky wicket. Going by the utterances of Periyar supporters who have demanded an apology from Rajinikanth, it was a 48-year-old story that nobody wanted to reopen.By pitchforking the issue and Periyar on to the present political debate, Rajinikanth seems to have achieved what the BJP could not. It is not clear if Rajnikanth has realised it, but it amounts to saying that if someone has to create space to emerge as an alternative to the two main Dravidian parties , he will have to chip away at the roots of Periyarism.It wouldn’t, however, be an easy task, as Periyar was much more than a Hindu idol basher. He was a rationalist who sought to usher in social reforms in a state where a minority upper segment ruled the roost for long. Periyar’s attacks on Hindu deities – something that M Karunanidhi inherited – allowed his opponents to take their campaign way beyond the brahmins and into all sections of Hindus. That could be the reason, why Periyar supporters today speak more about social reforms and less about Hindu bashing. To their dismay, Rajinikanth has now forced them to join the debate on Periyar’s Hindu rhetoric.The recent developments have, in a way, showed how the DK has mellowed from being a harsh radical outfit not long ago. Even Veeramani is forced to limit his counter to just “we will meet him in court”. The predicament of the DMK and the AIADMK, both of which swear by Periyar, is more precarious. DMK president M K Stalin said Rajinikanth is “only an actor, not a politician”, that he should ponder before he speaks; deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam made a similarly cautious statement, saying people should speak about Periyar only if they understand his ideology.None of the parties claiming the legacy of Dravidianism can easily disown Periyar, but at the same time cannot go back to the strident idol-bashing. In stark contrast to his father, Stalin has of late been projecting himself as a moderate rationalist, even acknowledging that religious belief would not be an impediment to being close to the DMK.The AIADMK, had long left the hardcore Periyar path; its founder MGR made it a ritual visiting the Kollur Mookambika temple in Karnataka, and his successor J Jayalalithaa made temple rituals and yagnas a natural extension of electioneering.The technicalities of Rajinikanth’s statement – which he said was based on a few media reports – may continue to be debated. What needs to be seen is if the actor-to-be-politician will continue the battle even when it gets dirty. If he does, Rajinikanth can be sure that he is ready for politics.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73521534,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-61464,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/periyar-may-help-rajini-launch-himself/articleshow/73501858.cms

Vadodara: Seventy-odd street children for whom a small stretch under the Fatehgunj bridge opposite M S University head office acts as a shelter, are now looking forward to a better future.

SHaR Initiative has started ‘SHaR Shiksha’— a programme for the betterment of street children — who are otherwise involved in selling of small items or begging on the streets to keep themselves alive. The initiative has been started in the memory of former dean of MSU’s Faculty of Commerce, late professor Sharad Bansal in partnership with city-based Pathshala.

“It is heartening to see the children’s commitment towards changing their lives. They wash themselves with the spare water, clean the floor below the bridge and get ready for their daily lessons where they are taught lessons on cleanliness and also to read and write,” said Hema Bansal, promoter of SHaR and wife of Prof Bansal.

“Once these children are prepared, some of them will be absorbed at Pathshala, which will provide them with a home away from home,” she said.

The initiative is being launched through a digital platform on February 1 so that all can participate for change.

SHaR initiative is designed to enable conscious citizens play a larger role in supporting the community and be a catalyst for change or be the change. It aims to motivate the young minds to participate in social initiatives to help them widen their perspectives and sensitivities on driving social and economic changes. “We hope that Vadodara will have the courage and openness to engage with diversity and inclusiveness,” Bansal said.

Jaipur: A single bench of Rajasthan High Court on Tuesday issued notices to the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) and put an interim stay on the FIR and further action against its former secretary S Nandu. The court comprising Justice SP Sharma issued an interim stay on the FIR filed against Nandu on September 4, 2019 at the Jyoti Nagar police station of Jaipur and issued notices to the RCA through its president.

The relief was given after a petition filed by Nandu. In the petition Nandu alleged that the joint secretary, RCA Mahendra Nahar had filed a case against him at Jyoti Nagar police station in which he was blamed of issuing an official notice on a RCA letterhead.

Thereafter, the matter was investigated by the police authorities who found that charges were proven against Nandu and found him guilty.

Thus, aggrieved Nandu approached the high court for the relief. In the petition through his counsel he maintained that investigating officer became a complainant in the case, thus the proceedings by the police was challenged in the High Court through 482 CrPC.

The court in its order also asked police to refrain from subsequent action in this FIR registered at Jyoti Nagar.

NASHIK: Spending long hours on mobile phones, chatting or surfing the internet, and sharing of salaries by working women are among the reasons for domestic violence , said an officer attached to the Bharosa Cell on Tuesday.

“Whether a woman or man, whoever is involved in spending too much time on the mobile phones, it leads to tension among couples,” police inspector Sangeeta Nikam of the cell told TOI.

The officer added that a number of working women have also approached the cell with complaints that their husbands or in-laws demand that they surrender their salaries to them.

Among such women complainants are professionals such as doctors and lawyers, said Nikam.

Moreover, domestic violence complaints have shown an upward trend. According to data available with the cell, 976 complaints were lodged by women against their husbands or his relatives last year as against 678 in 201.

Domestic violence victims generally go to a police station, who advise them to go to the Bhosara Cell, which was earlier known as the Women’s Security Cell.

The women police officials at the cell try to address the issues by listening to the grievances of the women and call their husbands to know his side of the story.

“Our primary goal is to try and reach a compromise between a couple so that they stay together. They are counselled so as to prevent their marriage from breaking,” said Nikam.

“At the same time, the couples are also told about the legal hassles they would face if an offence is registered. At times, couples are called three to four times for counselling,” she said.

The officer said that last year, out of 976 applicants, they could help reach a compromise between couples in 146 cases.

“Some applicants were asked to lodge complaints through courts, where 259 women withdrew their applications after counselling and went back to stay with their husband,” said Nikam.

However, 219 women decided to lodge police complaints against their husbands while the remaining applications are still pending.

“Women coming with complaints are from all strata of society, including doctors, lawyers and teachers. Spending a long time chatting with friends on social media is observed in most of the cases. In many cases, the man is found suspecting his wife of infidelity or vice-versa.”

Nikam said there are also complaints from working women that they are expected to do the entire household work and manage their jobs as well.

Jaisalmer: People of Siwana in Barmer district, who have been facing water problems for a long time, on Monday launched an agitation ‘pani nahin to vote nahin’ (no water, no vote). They took out a silent march from the town bus stand to SDM office before handing over a memorandum addressed to the chief minister.

Villagers have given an ultimatum of 15 days to the administration to solve the problem. If administration fails, then they have threatened an indefinite bandh and sit-in. Besides, they have warned to boycott panchayat elections.

The town is facing water crisis for last five years. Siwana is an assembly constituency and also a sub-division with a population of 40,000.

The memorandum states that groundwater in the town has gone down so drastically that the tubewells have gone dry. The locals said that in 2003, Pokhran, Phalsoond, Balotra and Siwana projects were approved. However, till date water has not reached Siwana despite spending crores of rupees. The pipeline was laid 10km from Siwana. Water collection house was started at Padardi Kalla, Siwana, which is lying closed for last one year.

Villagers have demanded to complete the project. And till the project is incomplete, water should be supplied through alternative means by laying a small pipeline, they demanded.

JAIPUR: The state education department has extended the pilot project of one-in-all textbook to all primary schools from the upcoming academic session.

The aim of the exercise is to lower the cost of school books, reduce weight of school bags and to introduce inter-subject comparability model (ISCM).

The new format of combining books had received overwhelming response from schools. “The format has been successfully executed and has showed better results in terms of learning outcomes among students. The department is prepared to implement the model in all primary schools spread across the state,” said education minister Govind Singh Dotasra.

Disclosing information about the plan, the minister said 4 to 5 chapters of all subjects will be included in a book.

“The compact book will cover the syllabus of at least 2-3 academic months. It will allow students to carry one compact book and notebooks,” said Dotasra.

Experts suggested that one book with five subjects will help in strengthening the attention of students. “The ISCM, if implemented, will help in identifying the reasons as to why learning capability subject-wise differs from one student to the another. Before the go ahead, they should study the pilot schools—response of students, teachers and also feedback from parents,” said KB Kothari, senior educationist.

The new format will remain for primary sections for at least a couple of years.

He informed that the state would also introduce QR codes in every book so that students can get an access to videos and audios.

The medium will help students in accessing content anywhere and make the reading or learning attractive.

NASHIK: The crime branch unit 2 on Tuesday seized gutka worth Rs 40 lakh from a truck and arrested the driver while he was passing through the city limits. Police have also seized the truck worth Rs 15 lakh.

Police found huge boxes and packets of gutka from the truck. They immediately informed the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) about the seizure.

The crime branch unit 2 authorities said that the said action was undertaken on the directives of commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare-Patil.

The action was taken after the crime branch unit 2 personnel received a tip-off that a truck carrying huge quantity of gutka was proceeding towards the Trimurti Chowk area from Untawadi. Acting on the information, police immediately swung into action, laid a trap and intercepted the truck in the said area.

Police said that the truck driver hails from Uttar Pradesh. During questioning, the truck driver failed to produce the challan of the goods he was carrying. He also told police that the truck was loaded in Chikhli in Gujarat on Monday.

He told police that the concerned person who had given him the consignment was supposed to inform him the exact address for delivery of the goods.

The crime branch officials said that the suspect has been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Food Safety Standards Act.

FDA officials said that Pan Masala has been banned in Maharashtra. However, the product is still being sold and bought in other states. Therefore, it becomes difficult to track smugglers bringing the banned product into the state.

In Nashik , police and FDA officials often rely on tip-offs to take action against illegal smuggling of the product.

Officials said that they are constantly taking action against those selling and buying the banned product. However, pan masala and scented tobacco is still sold in various parts of the city and the district discreetly, said officials.

237,['22/01/2020'],Rahman to mentor 20 kids from Nagaland,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Rahman will ensure the children are trained to become professional musicians

CHENNAI: People usually think music is a passion but cannot be a career. But Oscar-winning composer A R Rahman is determined to bust that myth through his K M Music Conservatory (KMMC) and the Sunshine Orchestra which trains underprivileged children for free. Rahman will mentor 20 children from Nagaland, ensuring they are trained to become professional musicians, and work to promote musicians from the state.

Last December, as the celebrated Hornbill Festival drew to a close, the Task Force for Music and Arts (TaFMA), Nagaland, and KMMC signed a memorandum of understanding to promote Naga musicians.

“We wanted to build a strong music ecosystem, and were reaching out to eminent personalities in the field as well as famous music schools who could mentor the talent we have in a professional manner,” says Theja Meru, advisor, TaFMA. “Since ARR is well known and KMMC has a very qualified music faculty, we reached out to them,” says Meru, who came to Chennai for KMMC’s graduation ceremony and met Rahman last August.

“When Meru visited us, I was taken with his sincerity and the Nagaland government’s request for help in improving musical infrastructure,” says Rahman, who attended the valedictory of the Hornbill Festival. “When I visited the place, it was clear that there is a thirst for creative development, so I wanted to help in any way I could. KMMC will act as a knowledge partner, initiating exchanges of students and staff, and share the best practices for musical excellence.”

Rahman also announced the launch of the Nagaland chapter of the Sunshine Orchestra during his visit. Launched in Chennai in 2009, the Orchestra is one of the flagship projects of the A R Rahman Foundation. Members of the Orchestra in Chennai have accompanied Rahman for concerts in India and abroad.

“We visited an orphanage in Kohima , home to 90 children. All of them got on stage and sang Christmas songs and they were so melodious they sounded like a proper choir,” says Adam Greig, academic coordinator, KMMC.

About 20 children from the orphanage, aged between eight and 11, have been selected to be part of the Sunshine orchestra. “We are now identifying potential teachers who will be trained at KMMC. We will then go with them to Nagaland to start the project. In future, we aim to put in place where they will keep coming down to KMMC and the staff here will also go to Nagaland to teach,” says Greig.

According to Rahman, the children will learn orchestral instruments while schooling and can then decide to pursue it full-time after completing studies. “It is our intention that they become career musicians, there is a great need for orchestral musicians in India.”

NEW DELHI: After leading the Congress attack against the Modi government over Citizenship (Amendment) Act, NRC and NPR , former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi will lead a students' rally in Jaipur on January 28, turning the focus on economic slowdown, unemployment and student protests across the country.

Rahul's public rally, scheduled just days ahead of the Union budget, will seek to highlight the government's failure to live up to its promise of generating two crore jobs annually, allowing the economy to slip into a free-fall, price rise, and also bring the spotlight on ""stifling"" of voices of India's students and youth besides fee hike.

The Jaipur youth rally comes at a time when Congress has stepped up pressure on the Modi government over CAA-NRC-NPR after party-led states announced in December that they would not support CAA and NRC.

Even as several party functionaries have tied themselves up in loops by making contradictory statements on the CAA, Rahul's Jaipur rally is expected to be a frontal attack on the Modi government over the issue while also bringing up the economic woes.

The joint programme of NSUI and IYC is also expected to give platform to students and youth who have lost jobs and are affected by issues like fee hike etc.

The project, ‘You Are Not Alone’, aims to achieve sustainable health and development for LGBTQ community.

NEW DELHI: Heavily made up, Isha walks up to the stage in a bright red dress. She wears a smile — warm and welcoming. A closer look, though, reveals that things are not as they seem to be: her eyes are brimming with tears as speaks up about her battle with depression.

Isha is one of the many participants at an event titled, “Bekhauff — You Are Not Alone” , at Delhi Gate . The focus is on mental health and suicide prevention among the LGBTQ community .

Recalling her struggle, Isha says it took her years to start thinking positively. “I attempted suicide at 16, just days before my Boards. I was mocked at and heckled in school because of my sexuality. I was convinced that life was not worth living. As blood oozed from my wrist and I tried desperately to stop it, I realised for the first time that I couldn’t let a few students dictate what life was all about... most of these students I won’t even meet later in my life,” she says.

As Maya (21) tries to console Isha, she shares her own travails. “I learnt about my sexuality when I was just a kid, but it took me 10 years to come out to my family. They asked me to either forget about it or leave the house. But some things cannot be changed. I didn’t try to make those changes either. Four years ago, I was kicked out of my house and had nowhere to go. This is when I tried to kill myself. Even now I think of it and laugh it off,” she says.

Anjan, founding member of SPACE, an NGO for suicide prevention, says: “Suicide rate is high among LGBTQs. The transgender community is the worst hit. There is no official data about LGBTQ suicides in India because there is no data on sexual orientation and self-perceived gender identity. But in 2019 alone, I have seen five transgender suicides in Delhi within our network. One can only imagine the number of suicides that take place and no one gets to know about them.”

The project, “You Are Not Alone”, is a step towards achieving sustainable health, including mental health and development of the LGBTQ community.

“In one of the cases, the parents wanted the death certificate of their transgender child to be that of a male. Even in death, there’s no acceptance. We need to strengthen the efforts and implement effective intervention as suicide is mostly preventable. Every life is precious,” Anjan insists.

Apurva Agnihotri, a makeup artist, says though she was supported by her mother all through, she was always depressed while growing up. “I channelled my energy into makeup and now I have made a name in Bollywood. I am glad that I didn’t commit suicide,” she adds.

NASHIK: Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari stressed the need to have private medical universities in the state to reduce the load on the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences ( MUHS ) in Nashik.

“MUHS is the only medical university in the state and is managing a large number of medical colleges. It would be better if there were a few private medical universities in the state. It would enable MUHS to work towards quality enhancement,” the governor said while addressing the 19th convocation of the varsity here on Tuesday.

There are 394 medical colleges providing education in different disciplines such as allopathy, homeopathy, affiliated to MUHS.

During his speech, the governor also stressed upon value-based learning. He also suggested that medical students should have an interdisciplinary knowledge about other medical streams as well. “The students should acquire value-based learning and use it for building the nation,” he said.

The governor mentioned ancient physicians Dhanvantari, Sushrut and Charak and said that the country has a history of Ayurveda.

“We have an enriched history in Ayurveda like sanjivani herb and our ancient physicians – who are called vaidya — were talented and could understand a patient’s anatomy just by reading the nerve. We should believe in our history and take it forward,” the governor said.

He also said that doctors should give back to the society and promote Pradhan Mantri Jan-Aushadhi Yojana.

Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh lauded MUHS for being one of the top medical universities of the country. “The students who have received their degrees today have achieved the goal with which they had entered the varsity. It is a proud moment and a golden day for them,” said Deshmukh, who is also the pro-vice chancellor of the varsity.

Deshmukh said that MUHS is a leading institute and they should strive hard to make it the best institute in the world. He insisted that students should make sure to keep Maharashtra in the pink of health.

MUHS vice chancellor Deelip Mhaisekar said they were taking steps to make the varsity a global medical educational hub.

“We are striving hard to make it an international education hub, where a mutual interaction programme, faculty exchange programmes and several others can be conducted,” he said, adding that they were striving hard to ensure high quality doctors pass from the institutes affiliated to the university.

The varsity has started cashless transactions in all its colleges across the state and the research theses are being accepted online.

Representative image

CHENNAI: Residents of Perumbakkam Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) tenements on Tuesday protested before the board’s local office after the apartments did not get water supply for the last four days.

This comes at a time when bountiful rain over the last six months has filled up Chennai’s reservoirs and increased water supply to residents in other parts of the city. A large group of women confronted local TNSCB officials and demanded answers. Around 12pm, a senior official came to the spot and said water supply would be resumed. Residents from blocks 1-10 of the Perumbakkam new phase tenements joined the protest. Around 100 families live in each block.

The TNSCB-constructed tenements house several thousand people resettled from slums on the banks of Cooum river and Buckingham canal. While lack of facilities has been a regular complaint, poor grievance redressal mechanism has crept up recently.

TNSCB collects a monthly rent of Rs 250 from each family while an additional Rs 500 is collected as monthly maintenance fee.

Prema (name changed), a young woman who was resettled from Thousand Lights area to Perumbakkam in November 2017, said TNSCB officials don’t pay heed to their complaints. “Water is supplied only once in three days. Complaints are not taken seriously and they ask us to complain to a superior officer,” she said.

This issue was highlighted in a recent study undertaken by Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities (IRCDUC) and Housing and Land Rights Network (HLRN), who work with the families and governments.

The researchers quoted residents complaining about lack of a proper grievance redressal mechanism.

A TNSCB official told TOI water supply was stopped due to an electrical fault which was rectified immediately. Responding to allegations of regular water supply, he said supply depends on Chennai MetroWater Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB)’s supply. “If it is regular, then we also supply regularly,” he said.

Former Australia captain, Steve Waugh bowled a delivery to Samarjitsinh Gaekwad as the Gaekwad family and palace staff watched the action in awe on Tuesday.

“It was a pleasant experience. Steve and I took turns to bat and ball to each other in the corridor of the first floor in the palace. He told me that it was a memorable experience for him as he never played cricket in a palace,” Gaekwad told TOI. “He also carried back some pictures of those moments,” he said.

“When we were kids, we used to play cricket in the palace corridors whenever it rained. I told him about it and he expressed his wish to play cricket with me similarly,” Gaekwad added. Steve, who retired in 2004, was in the city to meet Gaekwad and document cricketing culture here. “He is writing a book on cricket and hence he is in India to photograph and document cricketing culture here as this sport is a religion in our country,” Gaekwad said.

“He is travelling to about eight cities. Vadodara is a nursery for cricket, so Steve chose it. He recalled his playing days when he had played cricket match on Motibaug Ground, how my uncle Fatehsinhrao Gaekwad had hosted the Australian team,” Gaekwad added. Steve also visited Motibaug Ground and met some young cricketers who were joyous with his surprise visit.

He gave them some useful cricketing tips and taught them how to play on front foot before heading for the sprawling golf course near the palace. “He wanted to play a few holes. He is a good golf player too,” Gaekwad said. Steve also invited Samarjitsinh to Sydney Cricket Ground where he has a box in his name.

Later, in a video on his Facebook wall, Waugh recalled the match he played at Motibaug Ground and how he was adjudged out on 83 after a half hearted appeal by the bowler.

VADODARA: Worried about your vehicle that was towed away from a no-parking zone? Don’t fret. You can now track it online.

The city traffic police have added a facility to its website ‘vadodaracitytrafficpolice@gujarat.gov.in’ wherein commuters can find out where their vehicle – two-wheeler or four-wheeler – has been parked after being towed away.

“Any owner whose vehicle has been towed away can log into our website where details of spots where such towed vehicles have been kept in a separate section. We have four different spots where the towed away vehicles are parked,” said Amita Vanani, ACP (traffic).

The vehicle owner has to type in the area from where his or her vehicle was towed away and the website will show the spot where the vehicle has been kept.

A few months ago, the traffic police had initiated a drive to paint the main roads with yellow lines denoting parking zones. The vehicles parked outside such lines are being towed away.

“When vehicles parked in no-parking zones were towed away, many commuters would get nervous fretting about what will happen to their vehicles or where will they be able to collect if from the traffic police,” Vanani told TOI.

Many would also call up the police control room to find out spots where such vehicles were parked by the cops. “We have different spots for parking towed away vehicles in different areas. This new feature will inform citizens the exact spot where their vehicle has been kept based on the area from which it was towed away. It will also show directions to the spot,” Vanani added.

Sometimes fearing that their vehicle was stolen, confused commuters also reach the police station to file complaints. However, with the facility in place now, they can first check the spot first to verify if their vehicle has been towed away. The traffic police currently has 20 towing vans for two-wheelers and six for four-wheelers.

“We cover majority of the areas in the city but the outskirts are yet to be included. The towing vans work between 12 pm and 8 pm,” Vanani added.

246,['22/01/2020'],Mayor orders probe into ‘missing’ LED flush lights,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Electric department officials are claiming that the flush lights were stolen

NASHIK: Mayor Satish Kulkarni on Tuesday asked municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game to probe the alleged irregularities into ‘missing’ LED flush lights in Nashik Road area of the city.

The directive came after the issue was raised by corporator Prashant Diwe from ward no 17 in Nashik Road division during Tuesday’s general body meeting.

Diwe alleged that there has been a fraud of Rs 40 lakh. “Around 38 electric poles were erected with LED flush lights. But there are only two LED flush lights installed on two electric poles. The electric department of the civic body is claiming that the missing high mast lights have been stolen. But the height of the pole is over 30 metre and stealing the LED light from these electric poles is not feasible,” he said.

“The electric department of the NMC has also made the payment for 38 LED flush lights to the contractor concerned. The missing 36 LED flush lights were never installed,” he added.

Congress corporator Hemlata Patil said if the electric department officials are claiming that the flush lights were stolen, then why did they not lodged an FIR with police.

Diwe and Patil demanded that the mayor should probe into the scam and suspend the executive engineer of the electric department.

When asked, additional commissioner BJ Sonkamble said he had visited the ward as part of Swachh Survekshan and during his visit, he found that only two LED flush lights and other 36 lights were missing.

Taking serious cognizance of this, Kulkarni ordered Game to investigate the alleged scam and submit a report during the next general body meeting to be held in February.

The mayor also ordered that the official involved be stripped of his power till the commissioner submits the probe report.

Meanwhile, another proposal of civic administration to replace the rusted old poles with new ones in parts of six divisions at a cost of Rs 10.68 crore created ruckus at the meeting as several corporators accused the electricity department of the civic body of alleged corruption in replacement of rusted electric poles.

The elected representatives alleged that the proposal for replacement of rusted electric poles was prepared without any survey and without taking the corporators into confidence.

A section of corproators also alleged that LED bulbs are being installed on all 90,000 existing poles are of small watts. While there is need of over 80 watt LED bulbs on 18 metre above width of roads, the private company concerned is installing 30 watt bulbs which are of no use.

The mayor gave his approval to the proposal for replacement of rusted old electric poles and said a tender should be floated.

VADODARA: A 27-year-old married woman living on Waghodiya road was allegedly raped and attacked with a knife by her former paramour in Dabhoi on January 19.

In her complaint, the woman has charged the man of rape, attempt to murder and criminal intimidation at Dabhoi police station on Monday after consulting her family members. The accused Imran Malek was arrested on Tuesday.

According to the woman, Malek called her on January 19 asking her to meet him at the railway crossing near Thuvavi village in Dabhoi taluka. She initially refused, but when Malek threatened to harm her, she went with her five-year-old son to meet Malek. The accused took her in wild bushes nearby and raped her in front of her young son . Later Malek asked her to leave her husband and marry him to which she refused. Infuriated by her refusal, Malek took out a knife and attacked her near the private parts and also hurled the knife multiple times on her abdomen due to which she bled profusely.

The woman told police that she shouted for help, but the area was deserted. She lost consciousness when Malek kicked her on her face.

A while later Malek took the woman and her son to a private clinic in Thuvavi where she was administered primary treatment. After dropping her at a nearby bus stand, Malek fled the spot threatening her not to tell anyone about the crime.

After managing to reach home somehow, the woman then informed her husband and other family members about the ordeal.

Police said that before she was married, the woman had an affair with Malek which continued even after the wedding. However, when her husband learnt about it, she cut off all ties with Malek, who kept forcing her to leave her husband and marry him.

250,['22/01/2020'],"Two Baroda Cricket Association staffers quit, but kept their jobs too","This story is from January 22, 2020

VADODARA: A major controversy has surfaced in the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) after two of its employees were reinstated after the duo had resigned from their posts and their resignations were also accepted by the apex committee.

BCA joint secretary Parag Patel has objected to the move of letting BCA’s statistician Nandan Sawant and IT department’s Dinesh Nandwani work on, over-ruling the apex committee’s decision.

The duo had resigned from their posts in December last year. “They both used to go out of town as scorers in the BCCI cricket matches. Due to this, work suffered a lot in the BCA administration. So, the duo was asked not to work as scorers in the BCCI games,” said a BCA official. But, the duo chose to quit from their BCA posts and their resignations were later accepted by the BCA apex committee too.

“However, even after their notice period is over, both Sawant and Nandwani are continuing with their jobs. I have objected to it as the apex committee had taken the decision to let them go. How can they continue with their jobs now without the permission or resolution of the apex committee? I have written to the management about it,” Patel told TOI.

Both Sawant and Nandwani have been working with the BCA for years and have also been doing the scoring work in local as well as BCCI matches.

“The top management has continued with the duo reportedly on the condition that they won’t go out of town to work as scorer in matches,” a BCA apex council member said.

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation’s ( NMC ) idea of putting a battle tank , used by Indian Army during the Indo-Pak war, on display in Lehkanagar area has not gone down well with a local corporator .

Although the army has agreed to donate its tank to the NMC, the local corporator from Shiv Sena opposing the move, stating that it could lead to traffic problems. The issue was also discussed during the civic body’s general body (GB) meeting on Tuesday following which mayor Satish Kulkarni announced that he would discuss the issue with the corporators opposing this idea.

The GB and standing committee of the NMC have already approved the proposal to the battle tank on display in Lekhanagar area of the city. The City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) and traffic police have also given their no objection certificates (NOCs) for the same.

Shiv Sena croporator Kalpana Chumbhle is opposing the proposal. “There space where battle tank is to be put on display is very small and this will affect the vehicular traffic. Hence, the battle tank should not be installed there,” she said.

Another Sena corporator, Pravin Tidme, from ward no 24 in Cidco division raised the issue during the GB meeting on Tuesday and warned of a sit-in agitation in the House if the civic administration fails to go ahead with the plan. Tidme also sought mayor’s intervention into the issue.

“The NMC has already given its approval to the proposal of installation of the battle tank in Lekhanagar area of the city. Even other agencies have given their NOCs. Hence, saying that putting the battle tank on display will affect vehicular traffic in the area is false,” Tidme said.

According to Tidme, this t-55 battle tank was used during Indo-Pak war and had destroyed several enemy battle tanks. “This battle tank is a token of bravery and will help students get acquainted with history,” he said.

City engineer Sanjay Ghuge said the municipal commissioner had directed to install the battle tank in police protection. “We have written to the police administration seeking police protection at the earliest,” he said.

The mayor, however, has directed the administration to speed up the procedure to put battle tank on display there. “I will soon call a meeting of corporators concerned and will sort out the issue at the earliest,” he said.

SURAT: Police arrested two women for allegedly forcing her kids to beg outside Lambe Hanuman Temple in Varachha on Tuesday. The accused woman had three kids each whom they forced to beg outside the temple.

They were spotted by cops during routine checking following orders of city police commissioner R B Brahmbhatt.

Police arrested Aarti Thakore, 35, and Hansa Patni, 30, for the alleged torture and were booked under Juvenile Justice Act. Thakore’s three daughters – 9, 5, and the youngest being 2 years old – were found begging along with Patni’s two daughters aged 6 and 5 and their 2-year-old brother.

“I have ordered a special drive against those people using children to beg in different areas of the city. Police will take actions against all such people,” Brahmbhatt told TOI.

“It has come to our knowledge that some women beg with toddlers in hand or their laps. Police will check if the child is their own and ensure that any child forced into begging will be rescued and sent to the children’s home,” he added.

PUNE: Just when the prices of onions have stabilized to some extent in the market, the humble potato has recorded a price rise of Rs 10 per kg in the last few days. From Rs 30 per kg, the potato prices in the retail market have gone up to Rs 40 per kg.Retailers said the prices of potatoes had been stable for the last six months but recently shot up due to shortage in the wholesale market.Across the spectrum from hotels, eateries, homes and community kitchens, potatoes are the commonest vegetable, often used by themselves or with other vegetables. Though winter vegetables like a variety of beans, carrot, beetroot, cauliflower , spinach and others are a draw, potatoes are a necessity.Sources from the Vegetable Growers' Association of India (VGAI) told TOI that around 50-60% of potato supplies come to Maharashtra from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab .However, the inclement weather and rain in September and October last year in those states caused heavy damage to the potato crops.Maharashtra's own potato rabi produce in 2019-20 is likely to hit the markets after February 15, and it is only after this period that potato prices may normalise, they said.A source from the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Pune, said potato prices on Tuesday touched Rs 1,800-Rs 2,700 per quintal. At the start of December, this price was around Rs 1,200-Rs 2,000 per quintal.“Since the last 15 days, the number of trucks transporting potatoes to the APMC in Pune reduced from the earlier 50-60 per day to 20-25 per day. These trucks would bring potatoes from the northern states of UP and Punjab,” an APMC official said.Swapnil Gore, a potato wholesaler at Chakan market, told TOI that potatoes planted in November and December last year suffered losses due to on and off rains in parts of the state as well as cloudy sky conditions.“For instance, per acre area which was to yield 200-300 sacks of potatoes produced around 100-150 bags. Potatoes planted in November and December in the state hit the markets in January this year, but this time the supplies are less by around 50%. Potatoes that were selling in the wholesale market for around Rs 800-1,200 per quintal around November-December on an average have now gone up to Rs 1,800-Rs 2,200 or more per quintal,” Gore said.Kalu Igwale, a city-based vegetable vendor, said the price of potatoes in the retail market has gone up during the last month from Rs 30 per kg to Rs 40 per kg.“Lower supplies have come into the market due to low supplies from major potato producing states like UP and Punjab. Less produce from Maharashtra due to last year’s inclement weather and rains have also affected supplies,” he said.Vitthal Hanamgar, a retailer in NIBM Road said that prices are high as supplies of potatoes from Agra have reduced. “A bulk of potatoes come to Pune from Agra while the local supplies are usually low,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73507218,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-827908,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/potato-going-the-onion-way-as-supplies-fall-in-markets/articleshow/73500659.cms

If the immersion pond is converted into a amphitheatre, it can be used by all the communities to host such events,” said Chandrasekhar, secretary of Federation of North-Eastern Colonies of Secunderabad (FNECS).The residents are also planning to organise an event for Brahmins and Pujaris community to educate them on zero waste. Apart from this, they also plan to install a bin near the immersion pond that can be used to dump puja waste instead of disposing it in the lake.Four deaths have also been reported in the immersion pond at Kapra lake following which residents have also sought security check post at the spot. Residents attribute the deaths to highly contaminated water in the pond.The demand to convert the pond into an amphitheatre was first raised by the Sainikpuri residents with the municipal administration and urban development minister KT Rama Rao during his visit to inaugurate a water reservoir in the area in 2018. Back then, even the Hyderabad Mayor had responded stating that the GHMC shall look into the matter. However, till date, no decision has been taken on the same.“All that the GHMC has to do is to ensure timely removal of water and cleaning of the immersion pond for it to be used as a cultural space. It’s time that the GHMC considers revival of the lake which has been pending for years now,” said Raghunath Chary, a resident of Eshwaripuri Colony.The FNECS members are now planning to issue a proposal to the GHMC shortly and pursue the matter with them regularly.“I will put forward the proposal to the GHMC commissioner seeking necessary approvals to take the work forward,” said Bheem Prasad, superintending engineer, irrigation department.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73518647,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-138951,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/residents-seek-to-convert-kapra-immersion-pond-into-amphitheatre/articleshow/73500665.cms
258,['22/01/2020'],Tragic deaths forced detailed investigation,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Exemplary investigation was required in the case of Takshashila Arcade fire that claimed 22 lives, mostly of students, on May 24, 2019. City police were up to the task and booked 14 accused for culpable homicide and other sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC). The investigation was later handed over to crime branch. Of the 13 accused arrested so far, majority of them have failed to get bail because of the effective investigation done in the case.

“The investigation is still continuing. Police added IPC section that deals with forging documents in the FIR and used it against the accused during investigation. Search is on to arrest one accused who is on the run,” said a police officer of crime branch.

Those arrested were Jignal alias Jignesh Paghdar, administrator of the building; Harsukh Vekariya, Ravindra Kahar and Savji Paghdar, owners; and Bhargav Butani, owner of the coaching class; Parag Munshi, executive engineer; Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC); Jayesh Solanki, executive engineer, SMC; Vinu Parmar, deputy engineer, SMC; Himanshu Gajjar, deputy engineer, SMC; Atul Gorsawala, junior engineer, SMC, Sanjay Acharya, deputy chief fire officer, SMC; and Kirti Modh, fire officer, SMC; and Dipak Naik, deputy engineer, Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Limited. Dinesh Vekariya, one of the owners, is yet to be arrested.

Acharya, Modh and Naik got bail from Gujarat high court in December 2019. Bail pleas of other accused were rejected by different courts.

City police filed a 4,275 page chargesheet in the court in July 2019. They also submitted a report in the court saying investigation in the case was still continuing and that evidences were being gathered.

Meanwhile, anti-corruption bureau (ACB) too started an investigation against the accused SMC officers. It booked Vinu Parmar, S K Acharya and H D Singh, a junior engineer, posted in Varachha zone, in disproportionate assets (DA) case. Acharya and Singh were arrested and are currently lodged in jail. Parmar is yet to be arrested by ACB. Noticeably, Singh was not booked by city police in Takshashila Arcade fire case since his role did not come to notice during investigation.

“Parmar is currently lodged in jail and has failed to get bail after his arrest by city police. ACB is investigating DA of all the three officers,” an ACB officer said.

259,['22/01/2020'],Kolkata: Cops seize heroin worth Rs 105 crore from Paikpara,"This story is from January 22, 2020

The heroin seized by cops.

KOLKATA: The Special Task Force of Kolkata Police recovered more than 25kg heroin, worth around Rs 105 crore in open market, from a Paikpara house in north Kolkata in the wee hours of Tuesday. Two persons have been arrested so far in connection with the biggest heroin haul in the state in the recent times.

Cops found that the contraband was supplied to Kolkata and UP from Myanmar , Nagaland and Manipur. The arrested persons were identified as Moulana Fayazuddin (49), a resident of Kakching in Manipur, and Juber (40) from Bahraich in UP. The police are investigating whether the gang had any link with known drug lords based in UP-Nepal border. However, they have ruled out the possibility of the gang’s involvement with terror group funding in the northeast.

According to DCP (STF), Pradeep Kumar Yadav, the arrests came after continuous raids on heroin dealers since 2019. “On a tip-off, the STF’s anti-terror squad nabbed the UP-based narcotics dealer Juber and his Manipur-based counterpart Fayazuddin from Paikpara under Tallah police station,” he said.

A case under sections 21C and 29 of NDPS was registered at the STF police station and the accused were sent to police custody till February 4. “We will interrogate the duo who were paid for transportation of the contraband. We have come to know that a team was leaving for the UP. Juber and Fayazuddin are hawker and agricultural labourer, respectively. We suspect that they had supplied heroin to the city market,” said a police officer.

“The seized heroin appears to be purple-greyish and resembles the purple heroin that is mixed and can be life threatening. The suspected purple heroin is being sent to a laboratory to understand its contents. The purple heroin is an illegal drug that contains oxycontin, carfentanil and fentanyl. The last two ingredients are dangerous,” said police sources.

Cops suspect that the duo had made an arrangement, by which they exchanged the heroin with each other to make specific products ordered by their clients.

“We feel that the heroin was not brought from Mynammar, but from UP, MP and Rajasthan. A few quantity of the contraband was also brought from Afghanistan that saw bumper production of heroin crop in the past three years,” added the police.

Representative image

PUNE: Students who are five years and six months old this June can be admitted to standard I once the state government moves to set December 31, 2020 as the cut-off date.

The decision would be applicable from the forthcoming academic year, education officials said. A government notification about the new cut-off date will be issued in a month.

Director of state primary education department, Dattatray Jagtap, said, “There have been demands from parents regarding the extension of the cut-off date. It was extended to October but parents are demanding that it be pushed to the end of the year.”

“The department is thinking about a change in the cut-off date and once a decision is made, it will be announced through a notification,” he added.

In December, the state education department had set the cut-off date as September 30, 2020 for admission in the 2020-21 academic year in schools.

Students completing three years on this date will be admitted to nursery and those completing six years on or before the cut-off date can take admission to standard I, the notification had said.

The department received complaints from other parents whose children were born in October stating that their children would be at a loss. Hence, the decision to further extend the deadline to December 31 is awaited to put the arguments made by parents to rest, Jagtap added.

The Right to Education Act says a child should have attained six years to be admitted in standard I and three years for nursery. Education officials said the new cut-off would not violate the guidelines of the act as the child would turn six years old in the same calender year when he or she would still be studying in Std I.

The cut-off date took into account the school timings and the curriculum pressure for the age.

Before 2017, the cut-off date was set for July 31, but parents had complained then that students born in August were at a loss by just a few days. The education department then extended the cut-off date to September 30.

A school official from the city said, “The state government should take such decisions much in advance. Many schools in the city have started the process of admissions already and some would soon begin the procedure. These rules should be clarified in advance to eliminate confusion.”

People take part in a rally to protest against NRC, CAA and NPR in Kolkata on Tuesday

KOLKATA: The Mamata Banerjee government will table a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) during a special session of the Bengal Assembly on January 27.

“We are going to bring an official resolution against CAA-NPR-NRC. We expect all parties to attend the session and help us adopt a unanimous resolution on the issue,” state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said on Tuesday. Chatterjee added that he had informed leader of opposition Abdul Mannan about the move.

However, the resolution isn’t going to be unanimous. “Our MLAs will attend the special session and put across their views in favour of CAA. I am not very sure of attending the session because our party will be organising a mega rally in Malda on January 26,” said BJP MLA Swadhin Sarkar.

Calling the move “better late than never”, the Left Front and Congress said Trinamool had scuttled the proposal when they had insisted on it after Kerala assembly passed an anti-CAA resolution. “The opposition wanted to bring a resolution in the House in September. But that was not allowed,” Mannan said.

Left Front legislature party leader Sujan Chakrabarty said: “The ruling party didn’t allow such a resolution when the Opposition wanted to bring it. Did someone from Delhi prompt the Bengal CM to make the move,” Chakrabarty asked, harping on the “Modi-Didi setting”.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: The body of a 12-year-old girl was found in an open plot near Astha Kunj in southeast Delhi. Initial probe suggests that the body was carried to the spot by someone and dumped near the gate in the early hours of Monday.

It was found that the girl was strangled with a rope or a cloth due to which she had a deep cut mark on her throat.

Her clothes have been sent for forensic analysis to establish whether she was raped before being murdered.

The incident was reported around 9am when morning walkers found the body and alerted the security guards. Police was then informed, after which the body was sent for autopsy at AIIMS. The cops did not find any identity proof or a mobile phone.

It was found that she was wearing a salwar suit that was torn and soiled.

Police suspect that she could have been dragged before being strangled. The cops are scanning footage of the CCTV cameras installed at the exit and entry gates of Astha Kunj Park to find out whether the girl was murdered inside the park and then dumped near the gate.

A sexual assault on the girl has not been ruled out. The cops are also checking the missing complaints registered in the nearby police stations to establish whether the child was kidnapped.

Police sources said she might have been murdered hours before the body was found. They suspect that the body might have been kept elsewhere first, following which the killers might have panicked dumped it near the gate. The stretch of Astha Kunj remains dark.

Police said the details of the incident have been uploaded on ZIPNET, the repository of missing people and unidentified bodies. The body will be preserved for 72 hours as per protocol.

263,['22/01/2020'],Backward panel sought caste data before Odisha’s census call,"This story is from January 22, 2020

CM Naveen Patnaik

BHUBANESWAR: A week after the state government formally sent a request to the Centre to include socio-economic caste enumeration in the 2021 Census, it has emerged that the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) had sought district-wise data on backward classes from the Naveen Patnaik government.

The NCBC’s request had come three days before the state cabinet passed the resolution seeking caste-based census, on January 11.

The questionnaire sent by the panel sought socio-economic data on backward classes in the state, including their population, education, employment and social status and representation in state and central government schemes.

In a letter sent to state chief secretary Asit Tripathy on January 8, the NCBC deputy secretary, BK Pati, had requested that the details be submitted within 15 days. The matter is now under consideration of the state SC/ST development, minorities and backward classes welfare department.

Among the other details sought by the NCBC from the state government are — prescribed quota of reservation for backward classes in direct recruitment and in promotions, whether the state has promulgated any Act governing reservation for backward classes in services, backlog vacancies identified for OBCs, actual representation of OBCs in state PSUs, annual turnout of graduates vis-à-vis that of OBCs and data on pre and post metric scholarship schemes.

The NCBC has also sought details of OBC specific schemes, hostels constructed for OBC students and representation of backward classes in schemes like MGNREGA, National Rural Health Mission, Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awaas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana among others.

“It would be very difficult for the state government to respond to all the details sought by the NCBC as we don’t have any specific programmes for backward classes since we don’t have their definite numbers. We have asked the departments concerned to respond to the queries sought by the commission. We will reply accordingly,” said a senior state government official requesting anonymity.

The state has so far not launched any OBC-specific schemes. Population of backward classes in the state is around 54 per cent and they are being given 11.25 per cent quota in government jobs. There are around 209 communities identified as backward classes in the state.

The Naveen Patnaik government’s move had sparked debate over caste-based politics in state. The BJP had earlier criticized the state government for not providing 27 per cent quota to backward classes in Odisha.

Senior BJD leader and former minister Ananta Das said, “The Centre should consider the state government’s demand for a caste-based census to identify the socio-economic and educational status of the backward population.”

PUNE: A conman (27) stole the cellphone of a 28-year-old cab owner on the pretext of connecting his laptop to its hotspot and siphoned off Rs 3.05 lakh from the latter’s bank account and through his credit card in August last year.

The suspect, Hrishikesh Bomble, foxed the cab owner, Samir Divekar of Navi Mumbai, when he had come to the city in the latter’s car for some work. Divekar had first lodged an FIR with the New Mumbai police. The case was later transferred to the Nigdi police.

Bomble was arrested from Nashik in October last year in connection with transferring Rs1.53 lakh from the bank account of a software engineer after stealing his cellphone, worth Rs84,000. Police said the same man duped Divekar. “Bomble is lodged in the Yerawada prison,” said assistant inspector Gajanan Jadhav of the Chandannagar police.

Divekar, the duped car owner, said Bomble had first hired his car in July last year. “He hired my cab thrice and we got acquainted. When I took him to his native place in Khed in August last year, he borrowed Rs2,100 from me, which I transferred online,” Divekar said.

On August 5 last year, Bomble again hired Divekar’s cab for work at different places in Pune. “After reaching the city, he took me to a hospital for some work related to medical insurance and then he went to the PF office. He came out of the office after 15 minutes and requested me to give my cellphone because he wanted to connect his laptop to its hotspot,” Divekar said.

Divekar waited for Bomble outside the PF office till 10pm. “I went to the nearby ATM kiosk because I had run out of money but did not get cash there. After I returned home and checked with the bank, I found my debit card was blocked. Also, Rs2.75 lakh was transferred from my bank account to one Sunil Bomble’s account through net banking and Rs30,000 was transferred from my credit card to his e-wallet account,” Divekar said.

He said Bomble accessed his bank account and credit card through the stolen smartphone.

266,['22/01/2020'],NCDRC hauls up police for failing to serve warrants to realty firm partners,"This story is from January 22, 2020

PUNE: The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission ( NCDRC ) has taken a stern note of the police’s failure to serve non-bailable warrants to the three partners in Kondhwa-based realty firm KDS Infra Buildcons for non-compliance of its orders.

Altogether 132 homebuyers — mostly retired employees of Ammunition Factory, Khadki, armed forces and central government establishments — have been struggling for four years to get back their money in the range of Rs75,000 to Rs1.50 lakh paid between 2009 and 2010 to book flats in “KDS Dham” and “KDS Angan” at Charholi Budruk near Vishrantwadi. The schemes never took off and the firm sold the project land to a third party.

Responding to a 2012 complaint by consumer body Akhil Bharatiya Grahak Panchayat, the NCDRC on February 17, 2016, directed the realty firm and its partners — Bhupendrasingh Dhillon, Maruti Budhaji Kadale and Abhijit Maruti Kadale — to refund Rs1.34 crore with 18% per annum interest and Rs4 lakh each as damages to the 132 homebuyers.

In June 2016, the ‘grahak panchayat’ had preferred a plea for execution of the order. The commission has since directed NBWs against the KDS partners many times. But they have evaded the proceeding. “They have paid Rs10 lakh of the decree amount, which works out to nearly Rs4 crore,” complainant-lawyer Vijay Kharmale told TOI.

In its order on January 16, the NCDRC bench of presiding member Anup K Thakur and member S M Kantikar noted, “It is clear from a plain reading of the order dated April 10, 2019, that there has been less than full cooperation on the part of the civil police authority in carrying out the issuance of NBWs upon the judgment debtors (the partners).”

The bench said in case of the Kondhwa police’s inability to serve the warrants, the DCP (concerned) was to appear in person before it and the notice for such an appearance was to be served through the police commissioner. “However, there is no appearance nor any submission on behalf of officials mentioned in the said order,” the bench said.

The commission has given “one more opportunity” to the police for a fresh effort to serve the NBWs through the DCP and, in case of inability, file a clear report by the next hearing on April 16. “We will move a contempt plea in the Supreme Court if nothing happens on April 16,” said Kharmale.

DCP (Zone V) Suhas Bawache told TOI, “The NBWs couldn’t be executed as the three partners’ current addresses were not known. We have issued fresh orders to the Kondhwa police to find the addresses and execute the warrants.”

SUDA officials said the building will be sealed and a probe has been ordered against the developers for not complying with the fire safety standards. Talking with TOI, SUDA chairman Banchhanidhi Pani said, “The market will be sealed permanently after the dousing operations are over.”

The owners and partners are Hitesh Ponkiya, Chandu Korat and GR Asodariya. The developer had put up a plan in SUDA in 2014 to get the approval for the construction of textile market in 2014. It took about four years for the developers to built the 14-storey textile market. The developers had applied for the BUC in January 2018 and the permission was granted in October 2018.

BERHAMPUR: The MKCG Medical College and Hospital is facing an acute shortage of platelets, a component of blood, which is a critical requirement for patients suffering from illnesses such as dengue, leukaemia and haemophilia among others.

The two blood separation machines at the hospital’s blood bank are lying defunct for nearly a month, leading to the shortage of this critical blood component. “On an average, 20 patients require platelet infusion per day here,” a hospital source said.

The Odisha Blood Bank at the MKCG premises here can’t separate the platelets from fresh blood collected from donors as the two centrifuge machines stopped functioning on December 27 last year.

“Some patients are being referred to other hospitals, including SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack , where the blood component devices are available,” said a senior doctor.

The department of transfusion medicine at the MKCG has written to the director, medical education and training (DMET), for shifting of two such machines from SCB to the blood bank here. “If these machines are shifted, the problem will be solved. We are waiting for their response,” said Rabi Kumar Mishra, the head of department of transfusion medicine at the MKCG.

Hospital sources said the state government had provided these two sophisticated centrifuge machines in 2008. A blood bank employee said after the machines went out of order on December 27, an expert was called to repair the units but it yielded no results.

Health activists here have demanded supply of a platelet apheresis device for the blood bank here. Such devices are available in two medical colleges at Burla and Cuttack.

“We demand that such a device is installed in the blood bank here at the earliest,” said Abani Kumar Gaya, convener, Manabika Adhikar Manch, an organisation fighting for betterment of health services in Berhampur.

Earlier, the state government had recommended the names of the two Kendrapada girls to the Centre for bravery award as they rescued many persons from drowning and brought them to safety from the Nipania river, a tributary of the Mahanadi, when a boat capsized near the village of both the girls.

“Both the girls risked their lives to save 12 persons, including five children, from drowning in the river. They were in their houses near the river when they heard cries of many persons and immediately jumped into the crocodile-infested river and swam fast towards them. Both the bravehearts rescued 12 persons and brought them to safety one after another,” said Gita Siddhaartha, president of ICCW in a press release from New Delhi on Tuesday. Sabita and Purnima are among 22 children —10 girls and 12 boys — of 12 states who have been selected for the National Bravery Award -2019. One award has been given posthumously. All the awardees were present in the press conference in New Delhi where their names were announced to get the award.

“The awards are a fitting recognition and appreciation of noble traits in our children to inspire and steer them in the right direction,” added Gita.

Talking to this paper from New Delhi, Sabita said, “ We are delighted after it was announced in New Delhi that we have been selected to get the prestigious award.”

Recalling last year’s boat tragedy, Purnima said, “The boat capsized in the river and 10 persons drowned. It was not possible for us to drag them from the beneath of the boat as a result we could not save their lives. There was nobody around when the incident took place. We did not know what to do when we heard the cries for help. We just jumped into the river to save them.”

“The exemplary courage of both the girls and their presence of mind saved the lives of many persons from the jaws of the death. We are delighted that they have been selected to get the prestigious award,” said Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak, Mahakalapada MLA.

Transport activists said they were puzzled by the lack of emphasis on first- and last-mile connectivity options in the CMP. The Centre had directed states to keep this as one of their main objectives under the 2017 national Metro policy.

“While the city administration is planning so much for public transport, should they not put the first- and last-mile connectivity among the key points?” wondered a transport planner.

The first- and last-mile connectivity options include feeder bus services, electric rickshaws, smart cycles, buses, electric scooter services and tie-ups with cab aggregators.

PUNE: Transport experts in the city have expressed doubts about deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s push for a new Metro line from Swargate to Hadapsar, as there was no provision for it in the Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP), sanctioned by the Centre last year.The has a provision for five main Metro corridors covering the city and its surrounding areas, and experts said the new root, mooted by Pawar at a review meeting last week, is not covered. “The entire (CMP) process would require more sanctions and revisions,” one expert opined.“New Metro routes cannot be proposed without a proper mention in the CMP and without proper study. While there is a proposed 100km BRTS system and also the five Metro corridors a master mass rapid transit network plan should be proposed and approved before embarking on a DPR of any Metro line,” transport expert Harshad Abhyankar from Save Pune Traffic Movement said.Another expert said the state government would have to make an amendment to the plan to include this specific route and send it to the Centre for approval.The CMP is the city’s long-term blueprint to improve accessibility and mobility. It was prepared by Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) in 2018 — covering urban, semiurban and industrial areas — and was approved by the central government last year after PMRDA met all its requirements.The state government has asked the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the CMP. The CMP provides a basic road map, while the DPR will put forth the detailed engineering work required to make it a reality.Another expert said the CMP has a provision for a “Light Metro” corridor from Sinhagad Road to Pune Cantonment. “This can be extended up to Hadapsar and will intersect with the Shivajinagar-Hadapsar route (an extension to PMRDA’s Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar Metro corridor). This will cover Swargate and Pune Cantonment and can be considered,” the expert said, adding that this route was slotted under “Light Metro” as the ridership was expected to be low, and said DMRC can study this further to to turn it into a full-fledged Metro corridor.The DMRC has already submitted a DPR for the Shivajinagar-Hadapsar extension, which Pawar had suggested can be extended to Kadamvak Vasti or Loni Kalbhor.Citizens said they failed to understand the need for so many Metro lines. “New lines will not help unless people use public transport and reduce dependence on private transport,” one citizen-activist said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73513211,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-852194,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/swargate-hadapsar-metro-line-not-in-cmp-experts/articleshow/73500765.cms

BERHAMPUR: The MKCG Medical College and Hospital is facing an acute shortage of platelets, a component of blood, which is a critical requirement for patients suffering from illnesses such as dengue, leukaemia and haemophilia among others.

The two blood separation machines at the hospital’s blood bank are lying defunct for nearly a month, leading to the shortage of this critical blood component. “On an average, 20 patients require platelet infusion per day here,” a hospital source said.

The Odisha Blood Bank at the MKCG premises here can’t separate the platelets from fresh blood collected from donors as the two centrifuge machines stopped functioning on December 27 last year.

“Some patients are being referred to other hospitals, including SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack , where the blood component devices are available,” said a senior doctor.

The department of transfusion medicine at the MKCG has written to the director, medical education and training (DMET), for shifting of two such machines from SCB to the blood bank here. “If these machines are shifted, the problem will be solved. We are waiting for their response,” said Rabi Kumar Mishra, the head of department of transfusion medicine at the MKCG.

Hospital sources said the state government had provided these two sophisticated centrifuge machines in 2008. A blood bank employee said after the machines went out of order on December 27, an expert was called to repair the units but it yielded no results.

Health activists here have demanded supply of a platelet apheresis device for the blood bank here. Such devices are available in two medical colleges at Burla and Cuttack.

“We demand that such a device is installed in the blood bank here at the earliest,” said Abani Kumar Gaya, convener, Manabika Adhikar Manch, an organisation fighting for betterment of health services in Berhampur.

LUCKNOW: UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday said Congress was behind separatism and terrorism in the country and the BJP government was rectifying the mistakes of the grand old party and atoning for their sins.

Sharing the stage with Union home minister Amit Shah at a pro-CAA rally in Lucknow, Yogi said the BJP government took courageous steps that were for the good of the country, while Congress and other opposition parties only played vote-bank politics and worked to stay in power. ""BJP always put the nation above everything,"" the CM said.

Yogi attacked Congress for not accepting the citizenship law despite the fact that it was first introduced during the regime of Jawaharlal Nehru . ""Congress cannot see the country progressing and is conspiring to provoke people to stage protests and resort to violence,"" he said.

Yogi also accused Congress, SP and BSP of financing protests against the citizenship law. He said the opposition was not able to see PM Narendra Modi working to realise the dream of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' and was hatching a conspiracy to orchestrate protests and riots. Yogi said his government would not sit quiet and let Opposition spread misinformation on CAA.

""It is no less than 'cheerharan' (disrobing) of the nation like that of Draupadi in the epic Mahabharat,"" Yogi said, adding the government cannot keep silent on the issue and people should not be mute spectators like Duryodhan.

""People have seen big changes happening in last six months, be it the dilution of Article 370 in J&K, paving way for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya or bringing citizenship law. Many deep-rooted problems have been solved,"" he said, adding all the steps should have been taken earlier but former governments could not muster the courage,"" he said.

PUNE: An autorickshaw driver on Monday handed over a bag containing diamond jewellery and garments valued at over Rs 7 lakh to the police. A woman passenger had forgotten the bag in his vehicle near Apsara theatre around 5pm on the same day.

The police returned the bag to the 55-year-old home maker Shobha Sandeep Lunkad from Bibvewadi and feted the autorickshaw driver Tukaram Yadavrao Kale from Sasanenagar for his honesty at a function held at the Swargate police station on Tuesday evening.

Lunkad and her daughter had visited a mall on Moledina Road around 5pm on Monday. After purchasing garments, the two boarded Kale’s autorickshaw to reach home.

The daughter alighted at Pulgate bus stand and handed over the bag with the ornaments to her mother. Lunkad then reached Shankar Seth Road and alighted in a lane next to Mira Co-operative Housing Society to visit her son’s office. She paid the fare to Kale but forgot her bag inside the vehicle.

The ASI additional director general visited the temple and its adjacent areas on Friday

BHUBANESWAR: The requirements of the Archaeological Survey of India has brought the state’s ambitious Lingaraj temple beautification project to a halt.

The ASI additional director general visited the temple and its adjacent areas on Friday and expressed concern over the construction work, which was being carried on without permission.

Official sources said the state government did not seek permission before commencing the project from the ASI or the National Monuments Authority, which is considered to be mandatory for any construction within a 100-metre radius of an protected monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act.

Arun Mallik, superintending archaeologist of the ASI (Bhubaneswar circle), said, “It is indeed a great initiative by the state government to clear encroachments on and around the Lingaraj temple premises and develop its periphery. But they must seek permission from the ASI before commencing any kind of construction within its 100-metre radius.” He added, “The state government can continue with the beautification work after getting permission from the ASI or the National Monuments Authority.”

The works department had started digging around the temple and places near it, including the Ekamreswar temple, Lingaraj Police station area and Debi Padahara pond, about a week ago.

A retired engineer, Binayak Pati, said, “Since the Old Town area has several ancient monuments, which are mostly centuries old, a number of precautions are need to be taken before starting any construction work so that the old structures are not affected. The work should be done after consulting the ASI, which is an expert in conservation and the custodian of these monuments.”

The state government had announced the ‘Ekamra Kshetra’ redevelopment plan on 66 acres of land around the temple. The plan include construction of Lingaraj Entry Plaza and Lingaraj Heritage Complex, revival of Bindu Sagar, parking space, amenities for Kedar Gouri-Mukteswar complex, widening of access road, Heritage e-auto project, relocation projects and new heritage interpretation centre.

The Lingaraj Entry Plaza, which will be constructed over six acres of land around the Lingaraj Temple, will be an extension of the Lingaraj Temple Complex. It will have similar designs and architecture. It will also have special arrangements for Shivratri and Kanwariya pilgrims.

The major fire at Orchid textile market on the Puna-Kumbhariya road in May 2014 was the longest raging fire in the history of the Diamond City. It took nearly 19 hours for the fire fighters to bring the blaze under control.

However, Raghuvir Celeum market fire on Tuesday is set to break the past record as the fire department struggled hard to control the flames, which erupted around 3am, till late night.

“The wind is hindering the operations. The fire on the left side of the building was doused, but it again erupted in the evening. We cannot say how long it will take to completely douse the fire,” said deputy municipal commissioner, NV Upadhyay.

The dousing operation took long time due to the elevation in the building. “We were able to gain control on the fire, but the presence of highly combustible material inside the market is still a big cause of concern,” he added.

Fire officials of the Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) fire and emergency department said that there is a connection between the Orchid textile market and Raghuvir textile market fire incidents. The front elevation of the decorative design on the buildings having aluminium panels prevented the fire fighters to properly spray water inside the shops.

A team of firemen were deployed on the top floors of the textile market to control fire from inside.

KOLKATA: A 16-year-old school girl allegedly committed suicide after being reportedly asked by her parents to concentrate on her upcoming board exams instead of spending time on repairing her smartphone that got damaged recently.

The student, identified as Dolan Das, was studying in Class X had just completed her school tests. A resident of Purba Anadapally under the Regent Park police station area, she allegedly hanged herself on Monday late evening when her mother had gone out for a cup of tea at her neighbour’s residence around 6.30pm

“We had received the information about her death around 7pm from MR Bangur Hospital where doctors said that she was brought dead. The doctors at the emergency wing said she carried oblique and non-continuous ligature mark on her neck, an indication that she had committed suicide,” said a senior officer.

Police said that they had met her kin and neighbours and visited her residence. “Her father is employed in Gujarat and rarely gets chance to visit home. She stays here with her mother Rita Das and elder brother. It has been learnt from her neighbours that her mother had apparently been rebuking her for sometime for her obsession with the mobile phone and social media which Rita felt was distracting her daughter before her Madhyamik exam,” said police.

The duo had an argument even on Monday evening on the same issue after which Rita scolded her daughter for damaging the phone (it fell in the water) and then sending it to a repair shop without even letting her know. “After this, the daughter locked herself up in the room,” said an officer.

Sources said the student of Bansdroni Benoy Balika Vidyalaya later hanged herself with a saree from the ceiling fan around 6.30pm. Her mother returned home by 6.40pm and asked neighbours and some club members for help. “The club members broke open the door and found her hanging,” said Raja Das, an acquaintance.

“No complaint has yet been received,” said DC (SSD) Sudip Sarkar. Police said arrangements were being made to conduct inquest and post-mortem to ascertain actual cause of death. “We will not comment on the exact cause and reason till we get final reports,” said Sarkar.

Jaipur: The first patient to undergo a heart transplant at SMS Hospital on Thursday last is steadily recovering.

Initially, the 17-year-old recipient Vishal Kumar started behaving differently as he was showing symptoms of psychopathy, but doctors handled the situation and allowed his mother to meet him at the post-transplant ICU.

“The boy is steadily recovering now and there are possibilities that we will take him off the mechanical support tomorrow,” said Dr Anil Sharma, head of the department (cardiothoracic surgery) said on Tuesday.

Among signs and symptoms of his improvement, he has started demanding food of his choice and also he feels comfortable sitting and playing on a tablet provided by the doctors. “Since he is on high immunosuppressive to ward off chances of rejection of graft, we are taking measures to keep him safe from any sort of infection,” said Dr Sharma. He said the family members are allowed to meet him with a wall of glass between them and the patient.

However, the doctors initially faced some difficulties in conducting the surgery due to certain lack of coordination with other departments of the hospital, but with the intervention of SMS Hospital’s principal Dr Sudhir Bhandari, the work conditions at the institute improved.

SURAT: Four traffic brigade jawans were booked at Mahidharpura police station on Monday for an alleged attempt to extort money from a moped owner. The accused stopped the victim claiming that he was driving on wrong side of the road and demanded Rs1,500 from him for not seizing his scooter. This is a first of its kind case registered in city against personnel deployed to manage traffic since steep hike in fine for violation of traffic rules was introduced.

Police booked Shehbaz Sattar Ansari and his three associates for allegedly demanding Rs1,500 from complainant Dipak Bagul, 21, a resident of Gaurav Path. The accused had stopped Bagul who was riding the moped near entry gate of Surat railway station on Sunday evening. They grabbed the keys of the moped even before the victim could understand anything.

The complainant feared heavy fine for traffic offence when the accused demanded money from him. Bagul refused to pay the money when a traffic cop arrived at the spot. Three traffic brigade jawans escaped from the spot on seeing J K Bariya, police sub-inspector. The PSI asked the lone traffic brigade jawan why he was not with any traffic cop and also not wearing uniform. The accused argued with the traffic cop and later he too escaped from the spot. The PSI then sent the victim to police station where he registered his complaint against the traffic brigade jawans.

Bagul is employed at an automobile showroom and had gone to the railway station to pick up his father who was returning from a tour.

BHUBANESWAR: The state will introduce spoken English in Class 1 across all government schools from the coming session. Earlier, English was taught only from Class III.

“We have decided to introduce spoken English for students from Class I so that students improve their standards and be more competent. We are planning to give more importance to English and its teaching in 100 schools, which were selected to be developed as the Centre of Excellence in the state,” school and mass education minister Samir Ranjan Dash said in a review meeting at Nimapada in Puri district on Tuesday.

Dash added, “The decision has been taken so that parents also prefer these schools to English medium schools in the state. It is a worrying trend that most parents want to send their wards to English medium schools. Our teachers are competent enough.” Dash further said they would incorporate changes in the curriculum.

While parents welcomed the move, teachers are apprehensive about its implementation.

“It is a welcome step. Students will be able to speak English fluently, which is considered to be an important aspect in today’s world,” Subas Pradhan, a parent, said.

Khageswar Pal, secretary of the primary teachers association, said the government was only making announcements and not bothered about their implementation. “If it is implemented, it will be a boon for the students,” he added.

Some educationists said equal focus should be given on the Odia language and overall education system. “It is true that many students in Odia medium schools fear subjects like english and maths but focus on English may not be of much help. The government should give more emphasis on quality teaching instead,” Ratnakar Panda, a retired headmaster, said.

The doctor, Radhe Shyam Jena, and health staffers carry the pregnant woman in a makeshift stretcher in Malkang... Read More

KORAPUT: A young doctor and five health staffers carried a pregnant woman from one of the remotest corners of Malkangiri district on a stretcher for nearly 30km in forested hilly terrain to Kalimela hospital on Monday night. Though the baby couldn’t be saved owing to the strenuous journey, the woman was said to be doing well and was out of danger.

The doctor, indentifed as Radhe Shyam Jena (27), initially helped Reenama Bare, the patient, deliver a baby boy in her house at Kodidhulagundi village under the Maoist-hit Badural panchayat. After the first delivery, it was found that Reenama was carrying another child and needed to be shifted to a hospital, else lose her life.

“After Reenama gave birth to the first child, we found another child in her womb. As she was bleeding profusely and needed better care, we decided to shift her to hospital,” Jena said. He added, “We left the village around 2pm and reached Tekguda at 6.30pm. She was then taken to Kalimela hospital in an ambulance from there.”

The doctor, who has been recently posted at Kalimela hospital, said, “As the village is situated on a hilltop without any motorable road, the only option for us was to carry her downhill on a stretcher.”

Jena and his team were informed about Reenama by the local ASHA worker when they were conducting a pulse polio programme in Kodidhulagundi. “We rushed to help Reenama, who was in labour. Once home, we found that the villagers were helping her deliver the baby through the traditional method, which is unhygienic and often dangerous,” Jena said. “I intervened and helped in her delivery. She gave birth to a baby boy,” he added.

Jena and his team was in Dhulagundi village, about 25km from Tekguda, on Sunday morning to conduct a health camp. After completing the camp on Sunday, they spent the night there and trekked another 10km to reach Kodidhulagundi for the pulse polio programme.

Jena informed that the still born baby, which weighed around one kilo, was buried in the forest. “Reenama and her son delivered in her home are safe and are under treatment,” he added. The Kodidhulagundi village of Kalimela block comprises about 35 tribal families.

291,['22/01/2020'],Bicycle-sharing scheme bites dust,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Jaipur: Transforming Jaipur into a city of bicycles seems to be a distant dream even after spending crores under the Smart City project.

The bicycle-sharing project, mooted by the Jaipur Smart City Ltd (JSCL) two years ago, is far from completion as it is marred by lack of infrastructure. Around Rs 2.31 crore was sanctioned for this project.

The project kicked off on March 23, 2017, with the authorities identifying spots for 20 docking stations. However, only three of those — Ramniwas Bagh, Jawahar Circle and Landscape Park, have bicycles available for rent and the rest are lying empty.

According to sources, there are a few takers at the three docking stations where bicycles are available. The authorities have fixed Rs 10 per hour as the charges. Ramesh Saini (name changed), a manager at the Ramniwas Bagh, said people used to hire bicycles on rent earlier, but the response was lukewarm. “Nowadays, the docking stations are mostly shut as people never come. The scheme needs more publicity. Also, traffic makes it difficult to ride a bicycle ,” he added. None of the senior officials of JSCL were available for a comment.

Recently, transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas made it compulsory for the employees of his department to pedal to the office on the first day of every month. Many have criticised this decision stating that distance and traffic makes the commute difficult.

Neha Kulhar, manager of Muskaan Foundation for Road Safety in Jaipur, said, “Authorities come out with brilliant ideas, but they fail at effective implementation. How can a person ride a bicycle on traffic-hit roads,” Neha said.

In 2011, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) paved a bicycle track on Bhawani Singh Road (from JDA Circle to Rambagh Circle). The city’s lone 500-metre track has now become a parking lot for autorickshaws and cars. “Just by declaring a track for bicycles doesn’t serve the purpose. After Rambagh Circle where will the cyclist ride? Authorities must pave longer stretches for bicycles,” she added.

Another attempt to pave a lane for non-motorised vehicles was made in Kishanpole Market where a lane was painted green. However, within a week it was encroached by vehicles and commuters. This shows there is lack of sincere planning on the part of the government.

292,['22/01/2020'],Helipad sanctioned for govt medical college in Ooty,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Representative image

UDHAGAMANDALAM: The state has sanctioned a helipad for the upcoming new government medical college in Ooty.

Dr M Raveendran, dean and special officer, Ooty Government Medical College, said, “Since the district is a hilly terrain, the government has sanctioned a helipad for the new medical college to facilitate heli ambulance service.”

Pointing to the state’s efforts at implementing the ‘hub and spoke model’ of healthcare by linking the nearby government hospitals with a travelling time of less than three hours to provide medical aid, he said, “Given the ghat section roads, the Nilgiris district with a population more than 7 lakh has failed to find a place in that model, which is very helpful for the patients with heart diseases.”

In the hub and spoke model, smaller hospitals or spokes will initiate primary treatment and stabilize heart disease patients before referring them to tertiary care centres or hubs.

He said losing the ‘golden hour’ was a cause of concern as the nearest multi-specialty hospitals were in Coimbatore, which is 85km away with a travel time of around 3-4 hours. The heli ambulance service, the medical college dean said, would now address the issue.

He said the new venture would open up another 1,500 new job opportunities. “We had earlier identified 25 acres of forest land at Indu Nagar in Ooty for the medical college. The process to get land clearance from the ministry of environment and forest and climate change under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, is being speeded up. The forest department is very cooperative in this regard.”

As per the Forest Conservation Act, concurrence of the central government is mandatory to divert the forest land for non-forestry purposes. Pointing out that a sum of Rs 447 crore has been sanctioned for the new medical college, Dr Raveendran said, “With 21 departments, the 650-bed facility will have more than 300 highly-qualified doctors.”

While the share of the central government stands at Rs 190 crore, the contribution of the state government is Rs 135 crore. The state has allocated an extra fund of Rs 122 crore, considering the hilly terrain of the district.

According to Dr Raveendran, the infrastructure will include quarters for doctors, nurses and paramedical staff, and hostel for 750 medical students. The medical college will also have an in-house facility for house-surgeons. “Once the formalities of taking over the identified land from the forest department are completed, we will start the civil work,” he said.

The timeframe fixed for completing the project is about 18 months from the date of laying foundation.

After three years, the existing government hospital would become a peripheral hospital while the new medical college hospital would serve as the central hospital.

Presently, healthcare in the Nilgiris is considered vulnerable owing to unavailability of adequate specialists like cardiologists, physicians, neurosurgeons and nephrologists, etc.

Besides the local bodies, key government departments like irrigation and public health engineering will be brought under this compensation regime, if norms are found to be violated by them, the order said.

The penalty will be effective from April 1, 2020. The NGT has also made provision for adverse entries in to annual confidential report (ACR) of the CEOs of the local bodies and responsible government officers for non-remediation of legacy dump sites — detoxification of wastes through bio mining at dump sites where assorted wastes pile up for several years — by March 30, 2020. Besides, other local bodies need to pay up Rs 1 lakh as compensation.

Significantly, as per the order passed by the NGT bench of chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel, judicial member S P Wangdi and expert members Nagin Nanda and Siddhanta Das, an environment monitoring cell has to be set up in the office of the chief secretary for coordination and compliance of environmental issues. The state has to submit the quarterly compliance report to the court with a copy to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

The CPCB will be the custodian of the penalty and the money will be used exclusively on environment improvement projects, the order said.

TimesView Barring Takshashila Arcade fire, which killed 22 young students, barely has any stringent action been taken in case of thousands of other fires. Notices and temporary sealing drives have miserably failed to rein in the businessman and builders who care little for precious lives. Surat is India’s textile hub and such frequent fires are only denting its image. Authorities like Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) need to deal with all those refusing to adhere to fire safety with an iron fist.

By late evening, most dousing operation was completed, but smoke billowed

Surat, projected to be world's fastest growing city in the 2019-35, is fast earning an ignominious tag of Gujarat’s ‘inferno capital.’Barely eight months after a major fire snuffed out 22 young lives in the city, another huge blaze gutted the newly constructed 12-storey Raghuvir Celeum Textile Market on Puna-Kumbhariya Road in Saroli on Tuesday. The flames were raging for over 12 hours and thick black smoke was seen from kms away.Though there were no casualties, this was easily one of the biggest fires in the Diamond City’s recent history with 60 fire fighters with 300 firemen trying to douse the blaze, albeit with little success.Though the exact cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained, it is suspected that some fault in the internal wiring could have sparked the flames at around 3am that spread rapidly due to huge quantity of textile material stored in nearly 800 shops in the market.Two of the total three wings of the market were completely gutted.More than 60 fire fighters and a staff of more than 300 fire fighters from all the 16 fire stations of the city were rushed to the spot to control the fire.Three high-rise ladders equipped with water bowsers were used to control the fire and dozen fire tenders from industrial areas of Hazira, Palsana and Hojiwala along with Bardoli nagarpalika and Kamrej fire station were summoned for the fire fighting exercise. A National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team was also rushed to the spot to help in the operation.NV Upadhyay, deputy municipal commissioner, who heads the fire and emergency service of SMC, told TOI:, “We are yet to ascertain the exact cause of the fire, but it appears that there was some fault in the electric wiring. By evening, we were able to control around 60% of the blaze and decided to send the fire fighters inside the building to douse the fire in the shops.”The market was constructed in 2018 and the area is under the jurisdiction of Surat Urban Development Authority (SUDA).Municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani, who is the chairman of SUDA, said, ""SUDA has cancelled the building-use certificate (BUC) of the Textile market and the building will be sealed.""“It was a massive fire and we used all our resources to control the blaze.

Jacob Thomas

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has decided to demote IPS officer Jacob Thomas from the rank of DGP to that of ADGP on the basis of a departmental inquiry against him.

According to top government sources, the government has endorsed the findings of the report, and an order will be issued to this effect after serving a notice to the officer conveying the decision, giving him one more chance to defend himself. Once the order is issued, it will be the first such case in the state when a senior IPS officer will be demoted as a penalty. Thomas, an officer from 1985 batch of IPS, is currently the senior-most police officer in the state.

He was elevated to the rank of DGP in January 2015 and is set to retire from the service in May this year.

A government-level probe against Thomas for penning an autobiography without obtaining prior sanction had found him of having committed serious breach of discipline and criminal misconduct that should earn him major disciplinary actions. According to the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969, major disciplinary actions include demotion to a lower rank, compulsory retirement and termination from service.

The probe was conducted by former additional chief secretary (health and family welfare) Rajeev Sadanandan, who had given a detailed report after examining the book ‘Sravukalkkoppam Neenthumbol’ (Swimming with Sharks) by Thomas. The probe had found that the officer has violated Section 3 (1) (c) of the Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act and the rule 7 of the All India Service Conduct Rules.

As per the findings of the report, Thomas, who is a member of the police force, must obtain the prior permission of central government, or, of the prescribed authority before publishing any book except if it is in the discharge of his duties or if the book is of a purely literary, artistic or scientific in character. The book belongs to none of these categories or as part of discharging the official duties, because of which he cannot seek exemption from taking permission before coming up with such a work, the report had concluded.

However, the report had found that he cannot be held guilty of violating the sections of the Official Secrets Act, as the information used by him in the book are not those which have been banned under the aforesaid Act. A criminal case has also been registered against him by the crime branch under the Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act.

The government had initiated the disciplinary proceedings against him after turning down all the explanations furnished by Thomas, who is currently posted as managing director of the Metal Industries Ltd, Shoranur, under the industries department, on the basis of a favourable order from the central administrative tribunal.

He was originally suspended from service pending inquiry for making inflammatory and provocative comments against the government action during the Ockhi disaster in December 2017. The income tax department also attached 50.33 acres of land at Sethur village in Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district of Tamil Nadu that was held by the officer, under the Benami Properties Transaction Act, 1988, treating it as a benami property.

296,['22/01/2020'],Jaipur: There’s no plan for basic amenities in new multi-storey buildings’ draft,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Representative image

JAIPUR: New rules framed to allow construction of multi-storeys in residential areas appear to have again paved way for highrises in the city.

The rules were framed after the high court on January 12, 2017 banned construction of highrises in residential colonies. Although the state government had approved construction of highrises in colonies on 1,500 square-metre plot, there is still no plan for upgrading the infrastructure of these residential areas. This would affect many existing colonies including Bapu Nagar, Tilak Nagar, Bani Park , C-Scheme , Vaishali and others, which have bigger plots.

It is believed this would again create additional pressure on existing facilities in these colonies. The court had directed development authorities to identify special areas or zones for multi-storey buildings in the city, which will be mentioned in the master plan and zonal development plan.

However, no special areas have been earmarked in the guidelines and the scope of highrises will increase in many areas. A senior official at town planning department said, “There is no area earmarked and highrises can be constructed in any part of the city. But, restrictions on minimum road width and plot area have been imposed, which will make difficult to construct a multi-storey buildings in residential areas.”

Town planners reasoned, with an expected population of 4.2 million by 2025, the state capital will be among one of the most populated cities of urban agglomerations in the country. Housing this large a population will require construction of about 10 lakh more homes within the city. Since large empty tracts of land are not available within the city, the cost-effective method to overcome housing shortage is allowing controlled development in old colonies.

But, residents believe permitting multi-stories in residential colonies without laying infrastructure adversely affects the rights of residents already settled. Durga Singh, a resident of New Colony who was affected by construction of a highrise said, “The court directed multi-storey buildings should not be allowed in old residential colonies as basic amenities were developed keeping in view of number of plots and families residing. Construction affects the rights of local residents. But, new guidelines has opened the way in many colonies.”

Another resident, Amit Sharma says, “As population is increasing in colonies, the pressure on drinking water lane, sewerage, parking and other amenities is increasing. Without up-gradation plan allowing highrises construction will disturb the existing ecosystem.”

An official at UDH said the matter was examined at the state level. Vertical development is the need of hour to have compact cities saving precious agriculture land being converted for urban use due to horizontal expansion of city. “The policy for encouraging multi-storied buildings in a regulated manner is required. However, issues relating to fire fighting preparedness of highrises including width of the road, area of plots, infrastructure facilities light and ventilation require attention by all concerned.”

Jaipur: The Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) has been able to get 10,000 feedbacks from the citizens so far, which is much lower than the targeted 1 lakh feedbacks by January 31, for Swachhta Survekshan.

This year, out of 6,000 points in Swachhta Survekshan, 1,500 are for citizens’ feedback and it seems, like every year, Jaipur will be lacking in this as well. Last year, the city received 978 points for the citizens’ feedback, which is considered to be the main reason for its lower ranking.

Additional commissioner at JMC Arun Garg said that they are making efforts to get as many feedbacks as possible. “We have been advertising it and citizens are supposed to answer seven questions in the Swachhta Survekshan App. It will be really helpful and we are expecting good results,” said Garg.

The efforts to improve on the citizens’ feedback by JMC can be seen by the fact that they have declared award for the any vyapaar mandal, resident welfare society, college, university or coaching institute that will assist in getting more feedback.

As per the JMC, it will invest Rs 30 lakh for development work in any institute or organisation that gets highest number of feedbacks. Those on second position will get JMC investing Rs 20 lakh for it and those on third position shall get Rs 10 lakh development work done by JMC.

Surat: The district child labour task force including the labour department, anti-human trafficking cell and the city police on Tuesday rescued 29 child labourers employed in jardoshi units in the city’s Udhna and Anjana areas, respectively.

Official sources said that the task force team had received information about these units using children as labourers. A joint team of anti-human trafficking team, labour department, NGOs and the police raided the spots and rescued 12 children below 14 years of age and 17 adolescents.

The children were employed to do hand embroidery, or ‘Khatli work’, in the units from 8 am to 10 pm. They were paid monthly wages between Rs 3,000 and Rs 8,000 by their employers. All the rescued children hail from Bihar and stayed in the units itself.

Talking to TOI, assistant labour commissioner, Ashish Gandhi said, “We have rescued 29 child labourers. We have started working with the anti-human trafficking cell. Till now, we were not taking any actions against the adolescents. On January 9, we had raided in the same areas and rescued 19 children.”

Gandhi further said that earlier the labour commission would issue notices to the adolescent child labourers and take prohibitory action against children below 14 years.

“Now, with human trafficking activities on the rise, we are taking joint action with the anti-human traffic team to track and rescue both adolescent and child labourers,” he added.

According to Gandhi, police complaint has been registered against the these jardoshi units’ owners, identified as Murtaza Alam, Mohammed Khalil, Mohammed Jaibul and Taslim Saiful.

299,['22/01/2020'],MoD asked to clarify if ASC is operational arm of army,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: The supreme court has directed the ministry of defence (MoD) to submit its reply on a question put up by a serving officer of Lt Colonel’s rank over two yeas ago. He wanted to know whether the army service corps (ASC) is an operational arm or not.

The court directed that a reply has to be submitted within eight weeks. An answer on the matter was sought by Lt Colonel P K Chaudhary of ASC during Nirmala Sitharaman’s tenure. He moved the court after the question went unanswered.

This is a fallout of a cadre rift in the army over alleged favour to combat arms, especially infantry. An operational arm is the wing that directly takes part in a combat like infantry or armoured. ASC deals with the logistics.

The issue dates back to 2010 when a petition was first filed in the armed forces’ tribunal (AFT). The plea alleged that the promotion policy that was based on the AV Singh committee report was discriminatory. The fighting arms were favoured over other wings like the ASC, it said. After that, the AFT ordered scrapping of all the promotion boards since 2009. The AFT’s verdict was challenged by the MoD in the supreme court. At that time the ministry had filed an affidavit in the court which said that ASC was not an operational arm due to which there was a differential promotion policy for that segment.

Later, another officer from ASC, Major Amod Kumar challenged his posting to the Rashtirya Rifles, a combat unit deployed in Jammu and Kashmir . His petition cited the earlier affidavit in which the MoD had said that ASC was not an operational arm. He had challenged his transfer on the basis of the affidavit. At that time the MoD came up with another affidavit saying even ASC was an operational arm.

Based on the dual affidavit, Chaudhary had submitted a question to the MOD on 28 September, 2018, seeking its clarification. As it went unanswered, Chaudhary moved the Supreme Court.

In his plea, Chaudhary cited observations by the court in Major Amod Kumar’s case. The court has said the respondent (MoD) has submitted that the combat arms, combat support arms, ASC and other minor corps are all ‘operational’ entities having a distinct ‘operational’ role.

The IIEST team that won the first match of this season on their campus

KOLKATA: This is perhaps a first for college cricket in India. All matches at IIEST, Shibpur, this season will be played with the pink ball. One match was played over the weekend and there are several lined up that will see some of the best campuses participate in the second oldest engineering campus in the country.

Interestingly, the first match was played at ‘Oval’ — one of the two cricket fields at IIEST (formerly BE College) — that the British had prepared for their entertainment, modelled on The Oval at Kennington, the UK. The other field is called ‘Lords’.

A resolution in favour of the pink ball was taken keeping in mind the current craze and also because a few day & night matches have been planned. The T20 match that was played over the weekend, though, was a day match between IIEST and the Indian Institute of Architects, West Bengal. IIEST won the match. Matches this season will feature teams from NIT Durgapur, BIT Mesra, NIT Jamshedpur, Institute of Engineering and Management, St Thomas College of Engineering Technology and Jadavpur University.

“We first decided to introduce the pink ball for just one match to see how it goes. Looking at the success of the match, the sports and games society of the institute decided that all the matches this season on campus will be played with the pink ball,” said Sougata Majumdar, general secretary of the society. The resolution states that all rules mentioned by the Board of Control of Cricket in India regarding the usage of the pink ball will be adhered to.

Captain of the IIEST team Shounak Ghosh said a lot of brainstorming went into the decision. “We read and deliberated a lot on the topic. Certain facts tilted the case in favour of the pink ball. For example the use of lacquer instead of wax to give the pink ball its shine is an important factor. This helps the pink ball retain its shine longer. Moreover, the pink ball swings better in the first 20 overs compared to the red one,” he added.

The authorities are just as excited as the players at the ‘timely’ introduction of the pink ball. “Cricket specialists claim that the pink ball will bring the culture of day and night Test matches back. We wanted to be part of the pink ball excitement that has gripped everyone since the first such Test in the country was played at Eden Gardens,” said Debabrata Majumdar, dean of students’ affairs at IIEST.

301,['22/01/2020'],269 species of winged visitors sighted in dist,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Coimbatore: The district has once again proved itself to be a popular birdwatching hub and a route for migratory birds by recording the highest number of birdwatchers and bird species this Pongal Bird Count, an annual bird monitoring programme.

Rare species such as Isabelline wheatear and Siberian stonechat were spotted during the drive in the region that comprises Coimbatore, Tirupur, Nilgiris and Erode districts. According to birdwatchers, the high number of birds and the variety of species is a sign of rich flora and fauna in the region.

The Pongal Bird Count allows people to observe birds from anywhere in the state and upload the sightings on eBird, a bird listing and documentation platform. This year, the drive has seen the highest number of submissions from the birdwatchers in the district.

As per the available data, 269 species of birds were spotted in the district from January 16 to 19. “A total of 501 birdwatchers from the district have uploaded their sightings on the website (eBird),” said Jaganathan, an avid birdwatcher.

While the exact data on the number of birds spotted in the district and breakup of numbers in every species would be released only by February-end, birdwatchers said rare species such as Isabelline wheatear and Siberian stonechat were spotted at the Uppar river in Tirupur during the four days.

“Both the birds are from Russia. Of them, Isabelline wheatear has been spotted in Tamil Nadu only around six times,” said birdwatcher Magesh Ram, from Dharapuram Nature Society. He was accompanied by another birdwatcher, Sadhasivam Dhamu, when he sighted the birds. “The birds require plain rocky surfaces close to a waterbody. Last year, we spotted them in the Nalathangal reservoir on the eastern side of Dharapuram. This year, we spotted them in the Uppar river, which is in the opposite direction, as it had more water,” he said.

According to him, the arrival of rare bird species to the district from other countries and continents is a proof that “our flora and fauna is able to handle their habitat and food requirements.”

The Metro rail project is categorised under category-B, according to environmental impacts assessment

BHOPAL: Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for Bhopal Metro rail has categorised the project as one where environmental impacts are likely to be significant. The EIA has been prepared to fulfil policy requirements of European Investment Bank (EIB) as per its ‘statement of environmental and social principles and standards.’

The Metro rail project is categorised under category-B, according to environmental impacts assessment.

The state government has been stressing upon a holistic plan for saving green cover. It includes monetary cost to recover green cover loss during construction of Bhopal Metro phase I.

The cost is pegged at Rs9.09 crore. About 2,192 trees with girth of more than 300mm and 30 trees with girth less than 300mm will be affected at alignments, stations and depot area. Additionally, in some areas, pruning will be required, according to environmental impacts assessment and environmental management plan of the Bhopal Metro rail project.

Interestingly, cutting down of about 2,192 trees (1,199 for Purple Line and 993 for Red Line) would cost about Rs1.31 crore, whereas compensatory afforestation would cost about Rs 2 crore, going by the report.

As many as 8,768 saplings will be planted at 1:4 ratio for trees with girth above 300mm and 60 saplings at ratio of 1:2 for tree girth size below 300mm above ground level under the compensatory afforestation plan.

Meanwhile, twice in the last month, the MP government has withdrawn and re-floated an advertisement to fill the post of a full-time MD for MPMRCL. The foundation-laying ceremony of the projects that would transform public transport in Indore and Bhopal was undertaken last year by chief minister Kamal Nath, who is also chairperson of MPMRCL. Currently, the MD's position is held by urban development principal secretary, Sanjay Dubey. “Release of loan would be sought at a chosen time. Some funds from Union government has been released,” Dubey said.

He denied that release of funding for construction of Bhopal and Indore Metro rail has hit a technical glitch. About 50% of the fund release of total Rs 14,000 crore for development of first phase of the twin projects awaits the appointment of full-time MPMRCL managing director.

Legal obligations of the quorum of board of directors will be met. It includes a full-time MD for the Metro rail development company of the MP government, said MPMRCL officials.

The managing director -- as the chief executive officer -- will be responsible for overall functioning for implementation of Metro projects. Importantly, he will also be responsible for planning of further phases of Metro projects, including preparation, ‘tying up of funds and arranging government approvals’.

Last month, the Shanghai-based New Development Bank (NDB) agreed to provide a loan of USD225 million for the Indore Metro, according to reports. EIB is to provide loan for the Bhopal Metro.

Hyderabad: All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi urged the Telangana State Commission (TSEC) to withdraw its plans to use a facial recognition application during Wednesday’s municipal polls and said it violates the right to privacy of voters. “Have voters consented to being recorded when they enter a polling booth? Which law permits the use of this technology? tweeted Owaisi, after submitting a complaint to TSEC about their plan.

In order to prevent impersonation cases in municipal elections , the TSEC said it will use a face recognition application on a pilot basis for voter verification in 10 polling stations in Kompally.

The phone-based app will be used by additional polling officers who will first verify the identity proof of the voter and then take a photograph and upload to the server using face recognition app installed on their phone.

A negative return from this pilot exercise will not be used to deny voting rights to any voter, the SEC has said, but Owaisi said it’s being used without any statutory basis and had a risk of being leaked. “Are there any safeguards against breaches/misuse of the data? Right to privacy is a fundamental right and it cannot be violated so brazenly,” Owaisi added. TNN

Congress commission coordination committee convenor G Niranjan on Tuesday lodged a complaint with the state election commission on how incidents of alleged distribution of money, liquor and gifts by TRS members have been reported from a large number of urban local bodies , particularly Manikonda, Bandlaguda Jagir, Jogulamba-Gadwal, Peddapalli and Shamshabad. “It has come to our notice that Rs 10,000 per vote is being distributed by the ruling TRS,” Niranjan said.

At a separate media conference, TPCC vice-president Mallu Ravi said distribution of freebies by ruling party is a testimony that TRS sensed a Congress victory and is making last-ditch efforts to lure voters. “If KCR-led TRS government had done its job in last six years, there wouldn’t have been any need to distribute money, liquor and gifts,” Ravi said.

Ravi appealed to the voters to teach a lesson to TRS by inflicting a humiliating defeat on the ruling party. Niranjan urged the State Election Commission to take stringent action against the political parties, leaders and contesting candidates indulging in distribution of money, liquor and gifts to lure voters.

Kolkata: Two sergeants from the Howrah Bridge traffic guard on Monday evening coordinated on radio and chased down a snatcher in the packed Burrabazar area and recovered the booty before handing him over to the local police.

According to DC (traffic) Rupesh Kumar, a 73-year-old man from Howrah’s Golabari, Rajendra Gupta, had gone to a shop in Sonapatty on business. Around 8.50pm, he came out from shop with a bag that contained Rs 20,000.

“Suddenly a man came up to him from behind and snatched the bag. The suspect fled the spot along MG Road, running towards the east. Howrah traffic guard sergeant DS Lakra was alerted when Gupta raised an alarm. A few passersby, too, chipped in to help catch the suspect. Lakra alerted officers in the area over radio,” Kumar said. One sergeant, Arunava Dalai, picked up the message and responded. He identified the suspect among the crowd and chased him. As soon as the snatcher saw Dalai chasing him, he started running.

“However, Dalai gave chase for several hundred metres for nearly five minutes. He caught the man near Kalakar Street and recovered Gupta’s bag,” said Kumar. The snatcher was taken to Burrabazar police station where he was identified as Rahit Mali, a resident of Indra Biswas Road.

“We are checking the CCTV footage. We are also looking for records of other crimes Mali might have been involved in,” an officer said.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Telangana high court Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan on Tuesday sought to know within 24 hours from the vice-chancellor of National Institute of Technology (NIT), Warangal, whether he would go soft and permit a suspended first year B-Tech student to attend classes from Wednesday.

The NIT authorities had suspended some students and rusticated few others after they were caught consuming ganja on campus.

The CJ said that time had come for academic heads to think of gentler ways to deal with young students and new-age children instead of meting out harsh age-old punishments. Appearing for one such student, senior counsel DV Sitarama Murthy told the court that NIT was meting out shockingly disproportionate punishments to young students and displaying scant regard for their future. The case will come up for hearing on Wednesday.

Sitting along with Justice A Abhishek Reddy, the CJ said authorities must realise that young people were getting more experimental. Recalling his childhood, the CJ said: “One stare from the mother is enough to scare the child. But today, the children, particularly the millennium ones, are hyper. Parents in the US used to tie straps around the kids to pull them back because ‘Johnny will not listen to his mom.’ Hey, it’s my life, who are you? was the question coming from the younger lot that baffled the elders in that country.”

The CJ recalled how he took part in a movement aimed at better treatment of children between 1971 and 1980 in the US. “Though the situation is not alarming here, time has come for us to deal with young people in a merciful manner. Do not be arrogant and do not be harsh towards others should be the message we must drive home,” the CJ said.

Counsel T Mahender Rao, appearing for NIT, said 33 students were punished. “Unless we display stern attitude towards erring students, it becomes difficult for the authorities to manage the campus,” he argued.

A cage installed in the operational area at Jaipur airport.

JAIPUR: The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has installed six cages at various corners of the Jaipur airport and also engaged bird watchers to keep stray animals and birds away from the runway.

On Monday, panic prevailed at the airport after authorities rescued a jackal that got trapped in one of its cages. The animal was then handed over to the forest department.

“We have made an arrangement so that stray animals from Jhalana forest side and from Jagatpura area don’t enter the runaway. We have placed six cages at different spots at the airport in which we keep fresh meat as bait twice a day. Any animal or wild animal which comes near the boundary at the airport gets trapped into our cages and in coordination with the forest authorities they are sent back to the jungle,” said Jaideep Balhara, director, Airports Authority of India, Jaipur, on Tuesday.

He refuted the reports saying the jackal had strayed on to the runway. “The jackal entered and got trapped inside the cage and was finally handed over to the forest authorities,” he added. On the measures taken by the authorities to keep the runway free of animals and birds, he said, “We have also hired bird watchers on contract basis and have these cages. Also, we intimate the Jaipur Development Authority from time-to-time to ensure disposal of garbage should not take place near the boundary of the airport.”

“Because of the dimension of the Jaipur airport, especially its landing area and the runway, if ever any animal is spotted, the air traffic control alerts the authorities and flights are given green signal for taking off or landings only after clearance of the runway,” said a senior officer at the air traffic control.

Hyderabad: Municipalities and corporations in the surrounding Rangareddy, Medchal-Malkajgiri and Sangareddy districts are likely to witness poor turnout in the municipal elections . Reason: Most residents in these areas are IT/ITeS employees but their firms have not declared a holiday.

This, despite the Labour Employment Training and Factories announcing a paid holiday on day of polling as per the directions of the state commission.

Earlier, assembly constituencies in these areas had recorded turnouts ranging between 50 to 60 per cent during the 2018 state polls and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. On those days, the IT companies had declared a half-day. Municipalities under the three districts include Nizampet, Tellapur, Manikonda, Narsingi, Pocharam, Medchal, Komapally, Boduppal, Shamshabad among others.

Election authorities are worried that if companies do not declare holiday, the voting percentage in these areas will dwindle further. “Even during the previous polls, IT firms had denied paid holiday but finally gave half-day holiday after intervention of the government,” said B Ramnath, a software engineer.

However, managements said that it was not feasible to declare a holiday under these circumstances. “It is not possible for managements to give a paid holiday to employees who stay in Greater Hyderabad (where there is no election). Employees who have been staying in the surrounding municipal areas have to be identified to give them a holiday,” said B Ezakiel, a manager in an IT firm.

Goa Foundation director Claude Alvares

PANAJI: Reacting to the Goa Lokayukta’s order on the renewal of mining leases, Goa Foundation director Claude Alvares on Tuesday said they will follow up the case till its logical conclusion.

He also said that the review petion filed by the state governmet is just an eyewash.

Alvares said they will file applications under the Right to Information (RTI) Act to know the status of the Lokayukta recommendations.

Renewal of such leases is akin to handing it over to the mining companies ‘free of cost’, Alvares said.

“In 2015, the leases should not have been granted free of cost. The government ought to have charged crores of rupees by auctioning the leases. The public exchequer was deprived of this huge amount, and that is an act of corruption,” Alvares said.

Alvares also said that the Lokayukta order will not have any bearing on the ongoing mining cases in the Supreme Court.

“I don’t think any government in power, whether it is Congress or BJP I am not willing to make comment on it, will give away 88 mining leases worth Rs 79,000 crore to mining companies without charging something. Even for jobs, one has to pay Rs 2 to Rs 3 lakh,” he said.

Alvares also claimed that this ‘deal’ with the mining companies would have done been at the party level because former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar signed only one line in the lease renewal documents.

K Muraleedharan

KOZHIKODE: Congress leader and MP K Muraleedharan has asked governor Arif Mohammad Khan to read the history of Diwan of Travancore Sir C P Ramaswamy Iyer .

Speaking at the fasting staged by IUML leader M K Muneer here on Tuesday, he said Iyer had to leave Kerala with a half-cut nose. Iyer had declared that he will form an independent Travancore state, but he had to leave without accomplishing his dream, Muraleedharan reminded the governor.

“Arif Mohammad Khan had said that he is the Constitution. No, he is only a rubber stamp,” the Vadakara MP said.

The governor said he is not afraid of the people who said they will block his way, but he could not even attend a function held at Kozhikode beach, he added.

The state assembly had passed a resolution expressing the angst of the people of Kerala over the CAA. “The governor said there is a criminality in the action,” Muraleedharan said, urging chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to show at least the courage of BJP leader O Rajagopal, who said that the governor should refrain himself from having a confrontation with an elected government.

Earlier, inaugurating the fasting, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the state government should exercise caution while going ahead with the census process. It is not enough to avoid some questions from the census but the government should ensure that it did not enter trouble, he said.

Kozhikode MP M K Raghavan, UDF MLAs from the district and leaders of the front attended the 12-hour fasting that was held at Kozhikode beach from 9am.

317,['22/01/2020'],CLAT 2020 to focus on comprehension skills,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Representational Image

BENGALURU: The Common Law Entrance Test ( CLAT ) 2020, gateway to the most coveted law schools in the country, will undergo major changes to focus on students’ comprehension skills.

Scheduled for May 10 this year, this test will henceforth be conducted by the consortium of National Law Universities (NLUs) headquartered in Bengaluru. Till last year, law schools had been taking turns to hold it.

“The format of CLAT has remained the same for 30 years. There was constant criticism that the test has failed to evolve. It was not tailor-made for legal education, was not allowing diversity and was considered too expensive. It’s high time we addressed these issues and brought about a change. While the format will remain the same with five sections — English, current affairs, legal reasoning, logical reasoning and quantitative techniques — the ingredients would focus on evaluating the comprehension and reasoning skills of candidates. Overall, it is designed to be a test of aptitude and skills that are necessary for legal education rather than prior knowledge,” said Prof Sudhir Krishnaswamy, vice-chancellor, National Law School of India University (NLSIU) and secretary-treasurer of the NLU consortium conducting the test.

CLAT UGET 2020 will be a two-hour test, with 150 multiple-choice questions carrying 1 mark each. There will be negative marking of 0.25 for every wrong answer as announced earlier.

However, all sections will have questions based on passages instead of direct one or two line questions. “For instance, in English, there will be no direct questions on the meanings/antonyms of words. Instead, students will have to identify the main argument, conclusions and draw inferences from a comprehension passage. The same applies to current affairs or maths, where a passage will be followed by five questions where students will have to identify relevant information and apply their thinking skills,” Prof Sudhir explained.

The consortium has released one set of sample question papers and intends to release another two and provide learning modules by March. “Students spend tens of thousands of rupees on CLAT coaching. With this high-quality learning material, we hope to provide a level-playing field and equal opportunity to students from all places and economic levels. An average student needn’t enrol in a coaching class to crack the test,” he said.

The consortium will ensure that the language remains simple, unbiased to quantitative reasoning and is only to test skills the student would need in law.

Bhopal: Besides poaching of wildlife, forest officials are facing another problem— illegal felling of Khair (Acasia catechu) trees, especially from the forests in the tiger corridor. Insiders claim over 20,000 trees of the protected species have been smuggled out in less than five months.

Areas targeted by the timber mafia include Kheoni Wild Life Sanctuary, Dewas and Sehore, say officials.

Khair tree is a reserved category tree across the country and one needs permission from the forest department to cut it, said forest officials.

Special task force (STF) of state forest department’s wildlife wing arrested 23 people from different regions in six separate cases of illegal felling and smuggling of khair trees. Those arrested include a businessman from Mumbai and a tiber mafia from Daulatpur region of Dewas district.

Three trucks, a car and 50 tonnes of illegally felled trees have been confiscated so far.

Daulatpur which is located close to an active tiger corridor is a hotbed of timber mafia with 80% of the population allegedly involved in felling and smuggling of the precious tree. Officials say though Khair is mostly smuggled to Haryana and Rajasthan. It is much prized for use to make columns in construction work, besides, rice pestles, oil and sugarcane crushers and knees of boats.

The tree is known for its medicinal properties and one quintal of this tree fetches between Rs 5,000 to Rs 50,000 as per market demand.

BOX:

USES OF THE TREE

- Reserve tree: The Khair tree is reserved tree across the country

- Medicinal tree: It is used for making medicines for treating ailments like skin, neck, tooth, diarrhoea and lung infections

- Used for leather shining and making wooden ships

- Red part of the wood used for making ‘kattha’, a main ingredient of paan

Tirupur: District collector K Vijayakarthikeyan on Tuesday warned organizers of Alagumalai jallikattu not to exploit the event for commercial gains. The third edition of Alagumalai jallikattu would be held on February 2.

In a meeting held in the collectorate with various stakeholders of the event, he called on the organizers to ensure that the bull taming sport was held to promote only the local culture. “The district administration is keenly monitoring every step.”

The event organizers, meanwhile, said they were collecting money only for making arrangements. Last year, there were allegations that the event organizers had sold tickets and involved in fleecing.

The meeting also discussed the safety and security arrangements. District superintendent of police Disha Mittal and other police officials said the arena should come with eight-ft high double fencing. ""With more than 50,000 people expected to turn up to witness the event, the galleries should be strong enough."" The galleries for common people would have a capacity to seat 15,000.

While the event organizers said they would install 4 giant LED screens to live telecast the event, the authorities asked them to install more than 12 such screens. The authorities also mooted the plan to rotate the crowd at least twice to ensure that all the people get a chance to watch the event from the galleries.

The collector said the number of bulls to be released from vadivasal should be around 550. “Animal husbandry and health departments should ensure that the bulls and tamers aren’t under the influence of any drugs or liquor.”

He also urged the event organizers to complete the infrastructure and arrangements, including first-aid centre, and hand them over to the district administration 24 hours prior to the event.

321,['22/01/2020'],Ekbalpore lamp post that killed boy was 12 years old,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Kolkata: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s electrical department will conduct a special survey to check the condition of lamp posts across the city.

The decision of the survey came following the death of a five-year-old boy after a lamp post fell on him at a Ekbalpore locality on Monday morning.

A section of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s electrical department officials said that the lamp post that broke in two and collapsed on the boy was around 12 years old.

In fact, in a preliminary probe, the KMC ’s electrical department has found around 30 vulnerable lamp posts in the Kidderpore-Ekbalpore area, which needed urgent attention to avert a repeat of the tragedy in the future.

On Tuesday, a group of officials from the electrical department visited the accident spot to probe what had led to the accident. They took stock of other lamp posts in the neighbourhood maintained by the civic body.

In a preliminary report submitted to the civic headquarters, the borough engineers and electrical department officials held cable clutter on the lamp posts responsible for the accident.

“The killer lamp post was overburdened with loads of cable wires. Though we had earlier identified such lamp posts and asked the local cable operators to remove the load, they did not follow our instruction. Now, we have decided to inform the matter to the civic top brass at the headquarters, seeking permission for conducting a drive to clean up the mess,” said a KMC official of Borough IX.

According to a KMC official in the borough, the accident proved to be an eye-opener as a prompt survey conducted by the civic officials revealed that at least 30 lamp posts in three wards of the Kidderpore-Ekbalpore area could pose a threat to people. Beside danger from cable wires, residents face threat from these lamp posts, too, as they are old and need to be replaced immediately.

“We carried out a random check on the lamp posts in the Kidderpore-Ekbalpore area. We will submit a report, urging the civic authorities to conduct a raid against a section of cable operators who refuse to pay heed to our warning. We will also request the authorities at the headquarters to replace some lamp posts that have become unsafe with the passage of time,” said a KMC electrical department official.

The official also said a detailed study on the city’s lamp posts would be conducted borough-wise and insecure posts would be replaced immediately.

Bharuch/Surat: Dejected by failure in his love affair with a girl belonging to upper caste, a postgraduate tribal student of Vasava community hanged himself in his hostel room in Vallabh Vidyanagar on Monday.

Vipul Vasava, 24, a native of Dediapada taluka in Narmada district, was fourth semester student of master’s in commerce course of a university in Vallabh Vidyanagar.

D D Shimpi, police inspector, Vallabh Vidyanagar police station, said, ""The youth hanged himself to death using a nylon rope tied to a fan in his room. We have found a suicide note addressed to his parents from his room. He has said that he was in love with a girl belonging to upper caste and that they were going steady. However, she recently told him their relationship has no future because he belongs to a lower caste and would not be acceptable to her family. The boy said he decided to end his life because of this caste discrimination. We will investigate if this suicide note has been really written by the victim.”

His family lives in Kalli village located deep inside the forests in Narmada district. Narmada police will inform the victim’s parents about this tragedy. Vipul’s father Manubhai Vasava works in an agriculture farm, the police officer said. Besides Vipul, Manubhai has a son and a daughter. Vipul in his letter written in Gujarati to his parents has sought their forgiveness for ending his life. He has said in the letter it is not that his girlfriend didn’t know he belongs to Vasava tribal community, but decided to jettison him suddenly.

Vipul said he can’t stand discrimination on the basis of caste. He asks his parents to meet the girl’s parents and ask them if they believe tribals are in any way inferior to them. Vipul has said he is proud to be born an adivasi and requested friends to support his parents.

KOLKATA: Two Behala youths have alleged that they were duped online after they took their bikes for servicing at a popular service centre near Base bridge off Taratala. One of them — Raju Banerjee, a resident of Beldanga Road — has lodged a complaint with the cybercrime section of Kolkata police.

According to Banerjee, he had gone to the service centre early on January 17. “The executive at the centre told me that I must first register online for servicing. When I asked him for a helpline number, he pointed towards a number on a board,” he said.

“When I called on that number around 10am the same day, the person on the other end said he would send a link that would lead me to a form online that I can use for the registration. He also told me that Rs 5 registration fee would be charged,” he added.

Accordingly Banerjee filled up the form, but when he tried to use an ewallet to pay the registration fee, the transfer was not allowed. “I asked a friend to help. He used his debit card on a digital payment platform to generate an OTP. The moment my friend used the OTP, Rs 4,200 was debited,” Banerjee said.

Banerjee said he went back to the service centre, but the officials there claimed that their booking number was down. “When I told them that I could hear the number ringing, the manager told me their number had been hacked. He said that he, too, had lodged a complaint with the police,” Banerjee added.

Two week ago, joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma had shared a tweet by Paytm where the company urged customers not to respond to any call or message where the caller/sender claims that the KYC is about to expire. Among those who recently lost money was noted classical vocalist Shantanu Bhattacharyya who was duped of Rs 63,000. In his case, the ‘Team Viewer’ app was used to control his mobile remotely.

Hundreds of e-wallet customers over the past five months, including several from the city, have registered complaints after getting duped by scamsters posing as e-wallet firm employees. According to police, the accused targeted customers by asking them to download a mobile or desktop application to facilitate the KYC process. However, the applications themselves are legal. Such apps include Anydesk, Quicksupport and TeamViewer, said police.

BENGALURU: A baby boy weighing a whopping 5.9kg at birth is drawing a steady stream of visitors at government-run Vanivilas Hospital . The baby, born on January 18 morning, is said to be the ‘heaviest’ the hospital has seen so far. The child born through C-section delivery has no health complications.The infant’s parents, Yogesh and Saraswathi, are from Darjeeling and have been living near Yelahanka, Bengaluru for 16 years. The couple has another child. “The mother was referred from Yelahanka General Hospital on January 17 following her swollen tummy, which doctors thought could be a high-risk delivery case,” doctors at Vanivilas said.While doctors at Vanivilas thought she could be carrying twins given her weight (80kg), they were in for a surprise in the labour room when the baby arrived. The weighing machine read 5.9kg, leaving nurses and doctors shocked. The baby was 56 cm tall. The mother had completed 40 weeks of pregnancy and had conceived 14 years after her first child.As per records, this baby is the heaviest one to be born at at Vanivilas Hospital, said Dr Geetha Shivamurthy, medical superintendent at the hospital. “A newborn weighing 4.2kg was the heaviest we had seen so far. The baby and the mother are healthy. However, we are yet to do hormonal assessment tests on the child,” she said.While it is believed that pregnant women with gestational diabetes can increase a baby’s birthweight, in this case, the mother didn’t suffer from diabetes. The boy, however, has lost 100gms in the last two days, which is normal for all newborns.Neonatalogists say this kid could be the heaviest newborn in the state. “This is very unusual.

Thousands of people visit the famed Ajanta caves — around 350km from Pune — every day

PUNE: The Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation ( MTDC ) has proposed introduction of electric buses to transport tourists from the visitors’ centre in Ajanta to the historic caves .

The tourism body is currently holding talks with the authorities to introduce buses on the lines of The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply & Transport Undertaking (BEST), which rolled out electric buses in Mumbai in September last year.

“Ajanta caves’ gradient is not suitable for the battery-operated vehicles that we had in mind earlier and thus we are now looking for similar electric buses which would suit its gradient. We feel that BEST’s fleet of electric buses may be suitable for this purpose. We are still in talks with the authorities. A clear picture should emerge next week,” an MTDC official said.

“BEST’s electric buses are high-capacity vehicles running on heavy-duty motors. They may be able to ply on the steep gradient of Ajanta caves . We were earlier trying to opt for the 16-seater golf cart electric vehicles to be used here, but those were found to be unsuitable to ply on the caves’ gradient,” he said.

As of now, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses ferry tourists to the caves from the Ajanta Visitors’ Centre over a 4km distance. “MSRTC buses are old and operate on diesel, which is a polluting fuel. In comparison, battery-operated buses cause zero pollution. MTDC needs eco-friendly transportation around the caves,” the official said.

JAIPUR: Two youths were arrested for allegedly stealing a blood pouch from an attendant who had collected it for his patient from the blood bank at Sawai Man Singh Hospital on Tuesday morning.

Not only the two accused stole the blood pouch, they also sold it to the attendant of another patient. “When the attendant, who purchased the blood, reached the ward and handed over the blood pouch to the doctors, the staff on duty found that the blood group did not match. They asked the attendant from where he got it. The attendant told him that he had bought it from a person,” said Dr DS Meena, medical superintendent, SMS Hospital.

The hospital staff immediately called police which arrested the two accused. “We have arrested 23-year-old Devendra Sharma and 21-year-old Jai Kishan from the hospital,” said Lala Ram, a policeman of Moti Doongri police station.

JAIPUR: Teachers and employees working in government schools in Tonk district have been prohibited from wearing jeans and T-shirts by higher authorities.

On Tuesday, Shivram Singh Yadav, chief district education officer in Tonk, issued orders prohibiting teachers and other employees from wearing jeans and t-shirts in government schools. Teachers and workers have been asked to wear formal shirts and pants.

Officials have said that these dresses violate the decorum of the school. Speaking to TOI, Shivram Singh Yadav said, “These dresses do not look good in work areas. These are indecent and informal dresses. Employees must wear formal wear which will set an example for the students as well.”

Opposing the move, Narayan Singh Sisodia, president, Rajasthan Teachers and Panchayati Raj Employees’ Federation, said that this order must come from higher authorities and not from one district head office.

“It should be dealt by the Directorate of Secondary Education, Bikaner, and employees of one district should not be forced to follow such orders,” said Narayan.

This is not the first time when such orders have been issued. In 2018, when the BJP government was in power, the Directorate of College Education had introduced uniforms in colleges under which students were given a dress code asking them to wear salwar kameez or sarees and banning western clothes in educational institutions. The move came under severe criticism and was rolled back by the government.

Last year the directorate of secondary education, Bikaner, issued orders to ban mobile phones in school premises, stating that employees and teachers were on mobile phones and not concentrating on work. This order is still in force.

Bhopal/Jabalpur: National Law Institute University (NLIU), Bhopal, student, Himanshu Dixit, who has filed a PIL in the Madhya Pradesh high court seeking amendment in MP Motor Vehicles’ Act to make helmet compulsory for women two-wheeler riders as well, on Tuesday presented figures of fatal two-wheeler accidents from 2015 to 2019 in the court and said as many as 580 women have also died in those accidents.

The division bench of chief justice, A K Mittal and Justice V K Shukla, while stating that it was a serious issue also expressed dissatisfaction with the reply filed in the court by the state government and gave it the last chance to present its side on the next hearing on February 10.

In his PIL, Himanshu Dixit has challenged the legality of rule 213 (2) of the MP Motor Vehicles’ Act, 1994, which exempts women two-wheeler riders from wearing helmet.

Arguing the case himself, Dixit on Tuesday furnished figures of fatal accidents in the state from 2015 to 2019 and said out of total accidental deaths involving two-wheeler riders, 580 were women. He said that exempting women two-wheeler riders from wearing helmet was in violation to article 14, 15 (1) and 21 of the Indian Constitution. He said that the Motor Vehicles’ Act, 1988, provides for compulsory helmet for all two-wheeler riders except for Sikh men and pillion riders. It, however, provides that the state government may exempt a particular group of people or community from compulsory helmet clause. But, exempting women from the rule of compulsory helmet for two-wheeler riders amounts to “discrimination” against women and detrimental to objective of the rule providing for compulsory helmet ride for two-wheelers, which is to save their life.

In the previous hearing, the court had issued notices to all the respondents in the case to file their reply. Expressing dissatisfaction with the reply of the state government, the court asked its counsel to file a fresh response on the next hearing of the case on February 10.

Secunderabad: Loco pilots in South Central Railway ( SCR ) zone want vacancies to be filled soon, as they are mostly overworked and denied rest even after working for 14 hours at a stretch at times. There are over 200 vacancies for loco pilots in Secunderabad division alone

“Being an important division with many originating, terminating and crossover trains, it is important to maintain a healthy buffer staff there. Loco pilots can’t function if they are always forced to work odd hours and in extremely stressful conditions,” said K Sivakumar, divisional secretary, SCR Mazdoor union.

After corroboration with the railway authorities, it was found that in most cases, due to increasing number of trains from September to March, the drivers are burdened with back-to-back bookings and are provided with only two hours prior notice.

“Depending on the route and division, a loco pilot could be driving continuously for eight to 13 hours,” said a pilot requesting anonymity.

SCR officials said that replacement of overage assets, adoption of technologies for upgradation and maintenance of track and signalling systems to help loco pilots is their priority. “We ensure that drivers undergo periodic medical check-ups,” said a SCR official.

333,['22/01/2020'],GST pinches OFB as orders from forces down by 14%,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: The Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), that has drawn flak for being a white elephant leading to government considering a proposal to corporatize the organization , is also hit by goods and services tax ( GST ).

The tax has cut down purchases by defence forces , bringing down the orders to OFB by 14% in terms of quantity. Lesser order book has affected the OFB’s cost-benefit ratio too, said sources.

The additional cost due to GST has increased the outflow for the armed forces, which are the main buyers of OFB products. The increase in expenditure was compensated by reducing the orders proportionately, said sources dealing in the matter.

The forces have to shell out nearly Rs2,000 crore extra to meet the GST liability. The OFB needs to get indents worth Rs20,000 crore at least to maintain a feasible costing level. At present, the orders are at around Rs17,000 crore, out of which nearly Rs2,000 crore is the GST component. To lower the costs, the orders have to be more so that there is enough revenue to recover certain expenses and even reduce the pricing, said sources.

Following an order issued in March 1993, products supplied by the OFB were exempted from excise duty. In 2015, a 12.5% excise duty was imposed on its products. As the tax had to be passed on to the buyer, the cost for the force increased by 12.5%.

After excise was replaced by the GST, the tax component has further gone up. The factories have to shell out 18% GST on arms and ammunition which are the mainstay items of the organization. For supply of pistols to civilian market, a GST of 28% is levied. Even as the factories have been availing input tax credit on the supplies from sister factories and trade sources, it has still affected the cost, impacting the orders, said a source.

There are 41 ordnance factories under the OFB and Indian armed forces are the major buyers of the products which range from tanks, artillery guns to small arms and ammunition.

Though both OFB and armed forces are government bodies, technically there is a buyer and seller relation between the two. Ordnance factory has to be paid by the armed forces for the products it supplies. The funds go from the overall defence budget, out of which the tax component has to be shelled out too.

The OFB has always been facing flak for not being able to lower its costs. The orders have to be at an optimum level to maintain the ration. Although, on the brighter side, the supplies are still enough to meet the strategic requirement.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state’s economy can leapfrog if the natural resources are utilized properly, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.

Inaugurating the disaster management project for local self-government bodies here on Tuesday, the chief minister said that the climate and soil of the state is suitable for all kinds of agriculture. “If we utilize them in the proper manner with proper planning, the state’s revenue from agriculture can be up to Rs 1,18, 000 crore,” he said.

The chief minister said that the local bodies can distribute various kinds of saplings. If one crore saplings are distributed in one year, the state can generate Rs 50,000 crore revenue in the next 10 years. The CM said that the local self-government bodies should set up rain shelters for increasing the vegetable production. In 10 years, there should be 100 such shelters in each panchayat. The state will earn a revenue of at least Rs 31,000 crore through this kind of vegetable cultivation, Vijayan said.

Among the states that are investment friendly, the state is at present on the 21st place and this should be improved to become one among the top five in the next five years, the CM said.

He said that it is very important to ready people for the conservation of environment of the state, which is evident from the experiences of last two floods. The local self-government bodies should play a crucial role in this matter. Awareness on environment conservation and coordination should be the responsibility of LSG bodies, he added.

335,['22/01/2020'],Pragati Maidan PS set to make way for Metro link,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Kolkata: Preparations are on for razing the Pragati Maidan police station that has come in the way of Airport-New Garia Metro corridor. Thus, a major hurdle for the project is being removed after four years.

This week, Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), the agency implementing the 32km Metro link , plans to start constructing a temporary structure to shift the police station. A plot next to the existing police station has been identified for the makeshift PS.

“RVNL will take around three months to build the temporary structure and shift it there. Demolition of the existing police station building will start soon after the shifting,” said an official of Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA), custodian of EM Bypass.

KMDA recently chaired a meeting with Kolkata Police and RVNL and the decision on razing the police station was taken. The police station opposite Science City-Parama Island on EM Bypass has come on the alignment of three Metro piers, 246, 247 and 248, resulting in a 100m gap of the elevated viaduct. Airport-New Garia’s Barun Sengupta station comes up near the police station. RVNL had earlier contemplated temporarily shifting of the police station to the ground floor of the station premises. The idea was shelved.

After the old building is pulled down and the piers constructed, RVNL will build the permanent police station to the south of the existing one, near the Energy Education Park. The cost of building both the temporary and permanent police stations, along with the demolition expenses, will be borne by RVNL.

State officials said the police station had been built months before the Metro alignment was notified in October 2011. Therefore, the onus will be on Metro Railway to pull it down and rebuild a new one in its place.

“Demolition of Pragati Maidan PS is expected to begin in April this year,” a railways official said, adding, “KMDA has identified a plot beside the existing police station where the permanent building will come up.” Several meetings have been held between the state agencies — KMDA and Kolkata Police — and RVNL for more than four years. But it was only recently that a consensus could be reached.

The New Garia-Airport line is one of the Metro corridors announced by Mamata Banerjee when she was railway minister. The Rs 4,200 crore project, commissioned in 2012, has missed several deadlines.

Bhopal: Union minister for tourism Prahlad Patel has termed the agitations for and against CAA and NRC an ""ideological confrontation.""

Talking to TOI on Tuesday, Patel said, ""Ye vichardhara ki ladai hai (ideological confrontation). Those who are opposing it will ultimately be exposed."" ""They (Congress and those opposing CAA) have not been able to point out any mistake in the law but are creating fear about NRC. Shouldn't we have NRC? There is no NRC today, but does the country need it or not? This should be debated.""

Last week, Patel led a rally of 3,000 in support of CAA in Damoh - his parliamentary constituency - and appealed to people to ""save the Constitution"".

Asked about refusal of Congress-ruled states to implement the new law, Patel said, ""They must understand that there was only one state, the state of J&K, before Section 370 became history. Whenever a law was passed in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha earlier, it was passed with a rider, 'except in J&K'. But such days are gone since Modi ji removed Article 370 . Political statements are a different thing, but, constitutionally, no government has authority to refuse to implement a law passed by Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.""

THRISSUR: “I think today, here in Kerala, you are missing a chance if you don’t go back to some of the roots of the philosophical and religious discourse in South India , because it contains a rich vocabulary and understanding of what it means to be human,’’ says Phillip Zarrilli , the actor, director and scholar from the United Kingdom .

“Look at the concept of ‘Bhavana’ in the backdrop of the Kerala’s aesthetic discourses, it is not really imagination, which is just two dimensional whereas Bhavana is multi-dimensional, it is a new world and experience you are creating. Similarly the concept of spirit and mind are also different,” Zarrilli said on the sidelines of ongoing International Theatre Festival of Kerala ( ITFoK ).

“Look at Koodiyattam, the way Koodiyattam brings into an aesthetic reality, something that it material, is fabulous, it is creating a whole world, and the West is so representational, it is not multi-dimensional,” he said.

According to him in the Indian religious and aesthetic there is a lot of reflection of lived experience, on the immediacy of lived experience and attempts to focus on the things themselves.

The concepts of “discovering things anew, acting without knowing, situations where I don’t know what is going to happen” are also important to the Indian theatre tradition, he said.

According to him analysis can be burdensome at times. Sometimes it is important to know what you are going to do. But it is also important to make the actor stop thinking. Often the actors will have to undergo a certain kind of lived experience, and it is vital to ensure that such a stream of lived experience of the actor is not interrupted by westernized analytical thinking, he said.

The play “Eidgah Ki Jinnat” by Abhishek Majumdar, was staged to a packed to audience on the second day of the ITFoK. The “Eidgah Ki Jinnat” is the second of the trilogy on Kashmir planned by Majumdar.

The day also witnessed repeat staging of the Brazilian play “Silver Epidemic” which was the opening play of the 10-day-long ITFoK.

338,['22/01/2020'],"Corpn refuses to share info on official vehicles, cites security threat: Activist","This story is from January 22, 2020

Coimbatore: The Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation has stated that information about the vehicles used by the civic body officials would pose a safety threat to the authorities.

Curiously, the health wing of the civic body stated this, while the engineering section shared the information about vehicles, raising questions about the intent of the health wing in refusing the same information.

The response by the health wing is seen as an example of the corporation’s attitude in dodging queries under the right to information Act. The civic body gave the response in June last year and still maintains the stand despite repeated appeals seeking complete details of private vehicles used by the corporation.

What was even more strange was that the reply was irrelevant to the question asked. It was question number two and three of the RTI query filed in March last year by activist S P Thyagarajan, which sought details of vehicles used by the authorities while the fourth sought a copy of the corporation commissioner’s order for using private vehicles for civic works.

The engineering department of the corporation gave details for three queries, including those of vehicles used by the officials.

The RTI query was sent to the health wing to respond to the fourth query seeking the copy of commissioner's order for using private vehicles.

In an apparently irrelevant answer, the health wing said that it could not divulge details of the vehicles used by the officials, instead of responding directly to the information about the commissioner’s order.

“How is the reply even relevant to the question asked? Also, in what way providing details about their vehicles become threat to their safety. All the vehicles used by the officials, already have their designation printed on it,” Thyagarajan said.

Unsatisfied with the reply, the activist had appealed to the deputy commissioner in June. A month later, he received a reply saying that the reply to his question was already made.

When contacted, corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar said that he is neither aware of the RTI query nor the response given by the corporation authorities. “There is no threat to official’s safety as claimed,” he told TOI. He said that he would provide the details if he is approached.

Thyagarajan said that the corporation spends crores of rupees for vehicle maintenance every year. “That’s why I wanted to know about the vehicles that are being used by them. But it has been almost a year and I am yet to get the complete answer.”

Kozhikode: Law minister A K Balan said that the state government has no constitutional obligation to secure permission from the governor before challenging the validity of Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) in the Supreme Court under Article 131 of the Constitution.

Addressing the media in Wayanad on Tuesday, he said that nowhere is it said in Article 131 of the Constitution that prior approval of the governor is needed for filing a case in the Supreme Court.

“Also, permission of the governor is not required for passing a resolution in the state assembly on the matter. Only the approval of the assembly speaker is required for that. Even constitutional experts like former governor Justice P Sathasivam has said that it is not mandatory to inform the governor before filing a case in the Supreme Court and apprising the governor is just a matter of courtesy,” he said.

Balan said that even if rules of business have some provisions, the parent act, the Constitution, is above that.

“The act of the government to challenge CAA in Supreme Court and the passing of a resolution against the controversial Act do not violate the Constitution, rules of Assembly or the rules of business. Also, we did not mean to insult the governor. The issue of invoking Article 131 is now before the apex court. If the Supreme Court says that what the governor said is correct, we will accept it,” Balan said, adding that the government does not have an issue with Arif Mohammad Khan.

He said that Kerala Assembly had passed resolutions against laws passed by the Parliament thrice in the past. The minister reiterated that the government will not allow any questions in the Census which is related to National Population Register.

Addressing a press conference in city, he said police should immediately search for the unidentified assailants and act against those police personnel who were found negligent.

“The incident is a serious offence. The accused had beaten up the youth earlier as well, but police did not take any action and refused to register a case. Had the police been active in the matter, the incident could have been prevented. I have instructed the district SP to register case against unidentified assailants and the police personnel who were found negligent in the matter under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act,” Murugan told reporters after his visit to government Hamidia hospital where the youth is currently admitted.

Dhan Prasad Ahirwar, a resident of Dharmashri area in Sagar district, was set ablaze on January 14 over a dispute with Ajju Pathan, Chhuttu, Kallu, Irfan and their accomplices. He was rushed to local hospital and shifted to Bhopal later after BJP took up the matter with the government. Murugan visited Ahirwar on Tuesday who is battling for his life after receiving 70% burn injuries in the hospital.

Murugan, meanwhile, said he was not satisfied with the treatment given to the youth at Hamidia hospital. “There is no proper arrangement in the hospital. Despite severe burn injuries, he was not admitted in the ICU ward. We have offered to shift him to Safdarjung hospital in New Delhi for proper treatment.

I decided to create awareness among people on the ill effects of plastic for humans and animals,” Rao said.“The first thing I did was remove all the plastic items from my home,” he said. He then purchased 200 jute bags with the slogan ‘kill plastic before it kills us’ and distributed it in his colony at Uppal .“Since plastic cups and covers are carcinogenic, I purchased 400 stainless steel cups and distributed them to tea vendors. But unfortunately, they (vendors) discontinued use of steel cups as they don’t have manpower to clean the cups and also water supply tends to be a major problem,” Raghu Rama Rao said.Rao has also visited several schools and interacted with students as he believes that children are the best ambassadors for any change and that a sense of civic duty must be instilled from a young age.Apart from declaring war on single-use plastic, he has also taken up a green drive. He got his colony renamed to ‘Harithapuri colony’ from Vijayapuri colony with the help of local representatives. and with help from residents, the colony houses hundreds of medicinal plants. “Some people and organizations such as Lions Club have come forward to join my mission. But I tell them they can join me not by providing funds but by bringing jute bags and saplings,” he said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73518404,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-271847,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uppal-man-wages-war-against-plastic-for-7-yrs/articleshow/73501013.cms

COIMBATORE: The Peelamedu police on Tuesday registered a cheating case against three people, including a Friends of Police co-ordinator.

Friends of Police co-ordinator S Senthilkumar had befriended V Vijayakumar, 42, of Balan Nagar at Peelamedu, 15 years ago. “In 2013, he asked Vijayakumar to buy two sites at Kanuvakkarai village near Annur and pay the amount in monthly instalments. Vijayakumar gave Rs 20,000 as advance to Senthilkumar’s close aid R Eswaran, a realtor. Eswaran told Vijayakumar that he had allotted two sites at Ishwaryam Garden and asked him to pay Rs 2,91,800. Vijayakumar paid the amount in several instalments in 2016 and requested Eswaran to register the two sites in his name. Collection agent Krishnamoorthy used to collect the EMI amount from Vijayakumar,” a police officer said.

Senthilkumar and Eswaran told Vijayakumar that the sites were not approved and demanded more money to allot them. “The trio cheated Vijayakumar of Rs 3,98,600 and failed to register the sites in his name,” the officer added.

The Peelamedu police registered a case against Senthilkumar, Eswaran and Krishnamoorthy under sections 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy), 406 (criminal preach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code . Further investigation is on.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: On Tuesday, Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board’s ( KIIFB ) governing body gave work sanction for infrastructure development projects worth Rs 4,014 crore. With this, it has cleared 675 projects worth Rs 35,028 crore.

Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac said newly-approved projects include land acquisition for industrial parks (Rs 14,275.17 crore) and development of national hig- hways (Rs 5,374 crore). “The projects include 24 roads, one reach of hill highway, one reach of coastal highway, three hospitals, one bypass road, 56 schools, seven railway overbridges, a flyover, fishing harbour, 19 colleges and two tourism programmes,” he said.

Isaac said there was no dearth of funds to carry out national highway projects. “For NH development, KIIFB gives 25% of the land acquisition cost on behalf of the government. It comes to Rs 5,374 crore. There is a tri-party agreement between NHAI, state government and KIIFB. The amount from KIIFB and NHAI are initially kept in an account in the name of principal secretary (finance). This would later be transferred to the account of PWD secretary. Acquisition amount would be directly debited to the account of landowners as per the demand of district collectors,” said the minister. He added that no restrictions were applicable on releasing such funds and that KIIFB has transferred Rs 349.7 crore for meeting land acquisition cost.

Isaac said KIIFB’s governing board was satisfied with the position taken on auditing. “In order to ensure transparency at all levels, the board has decided to establish a comprehensive whistleblower mechanism; an external expert would function as an ombudsman,” he said.

The four generators in the power house started operating by 3pm. Electricity minister M M Mani visited the power station on Tuesday and assessed the situation.

There are six generators in the power house. The excitation transformer of the second generator exploded around 9pm. This generator was renovated recently and the successful trial run was conducted last week. This generator was used for power generation from Monday.

Since this is an underground power station the smoke gets filled in the substation suffocating the staff. Soon after the explosion all the generators were stopped and the staff were evacuated. Once the power production stopped, the state experienced a shortage of 500MW electricity. By Tuesday after noon four generators have started operating. According to a KSEB official, the cause for the explosion is being probed. It was also informed that there was no restriction in power supply in the state following the incident.

CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Senior JD(U) leader Pavan K Varma on Tuesday sought “ideological clarity” from party boss Nitish Kumar on taking the alliance with BJP beyond Bihar to contest the Delhi election.

In a two-page letter shared on social media on Tuesday, Varma said he was “perplexed” by JD(U)’s tie-up with BJP for the Delhi polls despite Nitish’s “apprehensions expressed in private” against the BJP-RSS combine taking the nation to a “dangerous space”.

In comments that may embarrass Nitish, Varma even claimed that the JD(U) boss, even after aligning with BJP again in 2017, had confessed “in private” how the current saffron party leadership had “humiliated” him.

Varma, a retired IFS officer and former Rajya Sabha member, in the letter also accused BJP of having “embarked on a massive, socially divisive agenda”.

Later in the afternoon, Varma arrived in Patna to attend an event. Responding to a query, Varma said, “My decision on whether or not to remain with the JD(U) depends on the response of the JD(U) president Nitish Kumar on how the party formed an alliance with BJP beyond Bihar.”

Varma's letter comes a day after BJP announced it was leaving two seats for JD(U) in Delhi and one for the other NDA ally LJP led by Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan . This is the first time that the Nitish Kumar–led JD(U) has forged an alliance with BJP outside Bihar.

“I fail to understand how JD(U) is now extending its alliance with BJP beyond Bihar, when even long-standing allies of BJP, like Akali Dal, have refused to do so,” he stated in the letter shared on social media.

Varma appealed to the JD(U) chief that “as you have emphasized” politics must be about principles and the courage of conviction. “I think there is an urgent need for JD(U) to harmonize what the party’s constitution says, what the leader of the party feels in private, and what actions the party takes in public,” the letter said.

“On more than one occasion, you have expressed apprehensions about the BJP-RSS combine. In my first meeting with you in Patna in August 2012, even before I had resigned from the IFS, you had spoken to me at length and with conviction on why Narendra Modi and his policies are inimical for the country,” Varma said.

“It was your personal view, as conveyed to me, that the BJP is destroying institutions, and that there is a need for democratic and socialist forces within the country to regroup, a task for which you actually assigned a senior party official,” Varma added.

“When you were leading the Mahagathbandhan (a grand alliance which also had the RJD and the Congress as partners), you had openly made a call for ‘RSS-Mukt Bharat’ (India free of RSS ). These views, articulated for a sustained period, are a matter of public record,” Varma said.

JD(U) national secretary general K C Tyagi declined to make a comment on Varma’s letter, saying, “It will not be proper for him to comment on a senior colleague.”

However, JD(U) state president and Rajya Sabha member Bashishtha Narain Singh said, “There is no problem if the JD(U) has made a tie-up with the BJP in Delhi. It is natural.”

Bihar BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand told TOI, “Seat sharing for Delhi election shows the rapport among top leaders of NDA allies. Varma should not have written the letter in public. In a way, Varma is questioning the top leadership, which is against the discipline of party hierarchy as well as the collective essence and ethos of NDA.”

Goa University advises foreign students to avoid secluded places

PANAJI: Goa University officials on Tuesday said that following the stabbing of their student from Afghanistan, they have informed the Indian Council of Cultural Relations (ICCR), under whose programme the victim was in Goa, about the incident. In charge of foreign students at Goa University, Rahul Tripathi, said that the Afghanistan embassy in India had also been intimated about the stabbing case.

Calling it an isolated incident and stating that it should not be connected with any other incident across the country, Tripathi said, “I would like to look at it as an isolated incident.”

He said that on Tuesday he took a delegation of GU students from Afghanistan to meet senior police officials.

Police officials have asked GU to submit details of foreign students studying at the university and has also provided details of police personnel to be circulated among foreign students for use in case of emergency.

“The incident occurred around 7.30pm on Sunday. The student was badly injured by the accused. It appears that he entered into an altercation with an unidentified youth. The incident is alarming, for we think of Goa as a safe place. But we also appreciate the immediate action taken by police. I wouldn’t call what happened pre-planned. Certain things happened in the heat of the moment,” Tripathi said.

He said that when foreign students come to Goa, during their initiation, they are usually advised to avoid isolated places, like the ‘view point’ at Dona Paula where the victim was stabbed.

The victim Matiullah Aria had come to India for the first time in June 2019 to pursue the MCom programme at GU under ICCR’s student exchange.

BHOPAL: The district administration is on its toes ahead of the BJP protest to be held on Wednesday. Top BJP leaders will take part in the protest demanding FIR against the Rajgarh district collector.

Senior BJP leaders, including former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, state president Rakesh Singh, national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and others, will visit Rajgarh to demand FIR against the district collector for slapping a BJP worker during a pro-CAA rally taken out by the party in violation of section 144 on Sunday.

BJP has been granted conditional permission for staging a dharna in Biaora town on Wednesday, but the district administration has asked BJP leaders to ensure that they deploy their own volunteers for traffic and parking management at the site of the protest. “We are keeping a close vigil on the situation. We have worked out the traffic management also. A total of around 350 personnel would be deployed at the site. A handful of personnel would also be kept on standby to tackle any law and order situation,” Rajgarh SP Pradeep Sharma told TOI.

On Sunday despite prohibitory orders, BJP workers led by former MLAs Amar Singh Yadav and Mohan Sharma and district president Dilbar Singh Yadav took out a ‘tiranga yatra’ in support of CAA in Biaora town. The situation took an ugly turn when district collector and another officer lost their cool and slapped a protestor.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The BJP state unit on Tuesday termed the Kerala government’s boycott call against certain questions part of the proposed census enumeration drive “anti-constitutional” and claimed that the prodding amounted to clear instigation for violating law.

BJP state spokesperson M S Kumar here on Tuesday appealed to the people in the state to reject the state government’s boycott call and cooperate wholeheartedly with the census work.

The CPM central committee, which concluded here on Sunday, and the state cabinet meeting on Monday decided to appeal public to refrain from answering questions that could be used for preparation of NPR, which is allegedly a step towards National Citizen Registry (NCR).

“Census work is not a political activity. Non-cooperation with census activities is a criminal offence. The state cabinet decision would result in far-reaching consequences and the LDF government in power would alone be responsible for all eventualities it entails,” Kumar told reporters.

The co-existence of power and struggle was an outdated political slogan coined by former CPM leader EMS Namboothirippad, he said.

“Such gimmicks seldom work in this era. Attempting to nudge people to defy and disengage with the census proceedings is nothing but an open declaration of war against the Union government. The government is in fact trying to hold people to ransom. If it is not so, why does the government appeal public to bury some answers? Why don’t the government show the gumption to say that it would not spare officials for the enumeration work?” he asked.

He appealed to the public not to fall in the political trap set by the state government.

PANAJI: Goa Medical College ( GMC ), which missed the chance to convert its post graduate diploma seats to MD and MS seats in 2019, has submitted its claims afresh this year, and with time to spare.

GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar said the premier college’s tally of MD and MS seats for the academic year 2020-21will increase as they have made their requests well in advance.

“We are confident that our submission will be considered as we have sent our request before the cut-off date,” said Bandekar. The college offers 124 PG seats comprising 26 diploma seats. Diploma courses are offered in radio diagnosis, obstetrics and gynecology, forensic medicine, preventive and social medicine, skin and venereal disease and psychological medicine.

GMC’s missing out on the chance to hike its number of PG seats last year turned into a huge controversy with students and parents pointing fingers at the management, which led to Dr Pradeep Naik— who officiated as dean then— being asked to step down, as it had later become clear that a “miscalculation” on the part of the administration had led to the college losing out on an opportunity to increase its PG seats.

One of the concerns by some is whether the lone medical college of the state will be able to upgrade its infrastructure once seats are increased, a pre-requisite when seats are sought to be increased.

Bandekar however has repeatedly stated that the required infrastructure would be upgraded in a phased manner once the proposal is approved.

In the last few years, GMC has been enhancing its infrastructure. The super specialty block, which is under construction, is slated to be completed in another six months.

A bridge using mud and stones was built by mafia in Chhatarpur

Bhopal: In a major action against sand mafia, more than 40,000 cubic meters of sand dumps were destroyed in Morena while a temporary bridge constructed on Ken river for transportation of the illegally-mined sand was broken in Chhatarpur .

In Morena district, the forest department carried out anti-sand mafia operation in the mining areas on the banks of Chambal river where mining is completely banned because of gharial sanctuary.

Around 40,000 cubic metres of sand, mixed in the soil in the form of sand dumps, were removed with the help of earthmoving machines in the villages of Bhanpur, Jaitpur and Piprai. The dumps were created in the fields of local farmers, officials involved in the action said.

Explaining the operation, PD Gabriel, divisional forest officer of Morena said, “The river across a large area and we need more manpower to check illegal mining more effectively. Such operations will continue in the coming days as well.”

Meanwhile in Chhatarpur, action against sand mafia was undertaken in at least more than half a dozen mines on Monday evening which lasted till late in the night. A joint team of mining department, police and the district administration carried out the operation.

When the team reached Ken river in Kandella village of the district, they were puzzled to see how mud and stones filled up in the shallow parts of the river were used to construct a temporary bridge. According to officials, this was done to facilitate transportation of the sand from Madhya Pradesh to Uttar Pradesh. The temporary bridge was also affecting the flow of the river, they added.

Mining officer Amit Mishra said that eight heavy vehicles were confiscated including a truck loaded with illegally mined sand. However, the mafia criminals fled towards UP crossing the river, officials said.

Despite the action, illegal mining continued in Kandella, Mishranpura and Singrampura villages where large number of mines are located.

Dehradun: Responding to an RTI query, the state government has disclosed that since 2002 over Rs 1.6 crore income tax (I-T) has been paid on behalf of MLAs in the hill state.

RTI activist Hemant Gaunia has sought the details of the income tax paid by the state government and also the exact year-wise amount paid. In Uttarakhand , the income tax of the MLAs used to be paid by the state treasury department annually and this practice has now been scrapped by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat.

According to the RTI details, in 2002-03, the state government had paid a mere Rs 3,53,927 as the income tax amount of the MLAs which in 2019-20 had shot up to Rs 19 lakh.

Gaunia said, “This practice of paying income tax of the MLA by the state government, should have stopped a long time ago but no one took it seriously. More than the total money paid by the state government, the question is why public money should be wasted like this.”

He added that the state government had followed the UP system which had recently scrapped the rule which allowed the state government to pay the income tax of the MLAs. The hill state has 71 MLA including an Anglo India legislator and this year they will have to pay their income tax on their own.

A state government official said, “All the legislators have been explained about the IT liability status and they would pay accordingly after consulting their CAs or tax consultants.” On an average a legislator gets salary and other perks valued over Rs 1.23 lakh per month.

Dehradun: The members of city bus union in Dehradun have expressed their displeasure over the DMC-proposed tax of Rs 10,000 per year on each private bus. They claim that Dehradun Municipal Corporation has “no right to impose such a tax unless the Regional Transport Department gives a go-ahead to the same”.

Vijayvardhan Dandriyal, president of Dehradun Mahanagar City Bus Seva Mahasangh, told TOI, “We condemn the proposal. Such a tax would be illegal and unjustified. The DMC announced that it is mulling to impose tax on private buses through newspaper advertisement. This is objectionable.”

The members of the body reached DMC office on Tuesday to register their discontent. “Public Works Department (PWD) is the road authority and Regional Transport Authority (RTA) looks after the commercial vehicles plying on city roads. We pay road tax to PWD and get ourselves registered with the RTA. Then, why is the civic body imposing a tax on us and that too as high as Rs 10,000 per year,” Dandriyal said. He added that the DMC should rather focus on providing facilities to passengers at bus stops, which lie in shambles.

Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey told TOI, “DMC has proposed to impose tax on some 131 small businesses. These include bus services, beauty parlours, saloons, hotels, eatery joints, among others. Final decision on tax and its amount would be taken after listening to the objections of the business and their scrutiny.”

Several motorists have met with accidents as they travel on sludge,” he said.

Due to the leaks, the residents are not getting sufficient water, said Raveendran, another resident. “We have been purchasing water from trucks for the last three weeks. A load of water costs us close to Rs 2,500. Over 60% of the households on the lane does not have bore water connection and are completely dependent on corporation’s water supply.”

“Frequent movement of heavy vehicles is said to be one of the reasons for the repeated damages. The corporation had laid new pipelines six months ago but are not supplying water through them,” Raveendran added.

In the complaint to the superintendent of police, activist S Ganesh said that he came to know about the WhatsApp message after it was forwarded by environmentalist ‘Vanam’ Chandrashekhar. The message read “People from Thadagam are tying up with Maoists from neighbouring states in the name of social activism and are trying to close brick kilns. Research has shown that they have close links with Maoists. If such an industry closes, the area will see an economic fall leading to many employees, owners, suppliers, construction industry and raw material suppliers getting impacted. This will make it easy for Maoists to enter the area. Instead of worrying about this, two people are trying to close brick kilns.”

Though the message didn’t mention names, it is targeting him and activist TMS Rajendran , Ganesh said. “Rajendran had filed a PIL last October against brick kilns and I had filed many RTIs and got damaging information about brick kiln operators,” he said. The duo requested police to find out the origin of the message and act against the perpetrators for defaming them.

LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday, said Congress was behind separatism and terrorism in the country and BJP government was rectifying mistakes of the grand old party and atoning for their sins.

Sharing the stage with Union home minister Amit Shah at a pro-CAA rally in Lucknow, Yogi said the BJP government took courageous steps that were for the good of the country, while Congress and other Opposition parties only played vote-bank politics and worked to stay in power. “BJP always put the nation above everything,” the chief minister said.

Yogi attacked Congress for not accepting the citizenship law, despite the fact that it was first introduced during the regime of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. “Congress cannot see the country progressing and is conspiring to provoke people to stage protests and resort to violence,” he said.

Yogi accused Congress, SP and BSP of financing protests against the citizenship law. He said the opposition was not able to see PM Narendra Modi working to realize the dream of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ and was hatching a conspiracy to orchestrate protests and riots. Yogi said his government would not sit quiet and let Opposition spread lies on CAA.

“It is no less than ‘cheerharan’ (disrobing) of the nation like that of Draupadi in the epic Mahabharat,” Yogi said, adding the government cannot keep silent on the issue and people should not be mute spectators like Duryodhan.

“People have seen big changes happening in last six months, be it the dilution of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, paving way for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya or bringing citizenship law, ” said Yogi.

The southern zone of National Green Tribuanl (NGT) has imposed a fine of Rs 8 crore on the city-based KGISL Trust for constructing a multi-storeyed apartment without obtaining environmental clearance.

The firm had in 2010 proposed to construct the 37,000sqft-big building at Keeranatham, an IT hub in Coimbatore. The project titled 'Platina' has more than 400 residential units.

It is mandatory for firms to obtain prior environmental clearance (EC) while constructing apartments of this magnitude, according to Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006.

However, KGISL started constructing the flats before obtaining EC, said petitioner V Sankara Subramanian, an environmental activist from Tirunelveli.

The State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) too confirmed the violation in its letter to Tamil Nadu Forest Department Secretary in May 2013.

SEIAA further recommended Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to initiate legal action against the firm for the said violation under section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

District Environmental Engineer, Coimbatore North filed a case with the local Judicial Magistrate against B Ashok, managing director of the firm, R Maheswaran, vice president and others.

Meanwhile, the construction was completed and all flats got sold out soon.

KGISL in response argued that the Union Environment Ministry had issued a notification for regularising EIA violation projects and they were following provisions within stipulated deadline mentioned in the notification.

On hearing both the sides, NGT SZ members -- Justice K Ramakrishnan and Saibal Dasgupta -- directed the firm to deposit the initial penalty amount before Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) within two months.

The members also government to form a committee with representatives from pollution control boards and other related government agencies. This joint-committee has been told to submit an inspection report soon.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Local bodies in the state will have to prepare disaster management plans in addition to annual plans in the wake of recurring natural calamities in the state. The local self government (LSG) department has issued specific set of instructions for the preparation of disaster management plan.

Public buildings like halls, schools, hospitals, vulnerable to disasters and areas vulnerable to disasters will also be recorded in the template. An evacuation plan, basic life support team, voluntary group are other major components in the template. The plan will also give emphasis on grounds that can be converted into temporary helipads or those areas which can house cattle.

The plan will be prepared in standardized templates so that district-level disaster management authority will be able to incorporate other details from locally available information. The project will have two components. Situation analysis resource mapping and intervention comprise the first part. The projects which will be undertaken by local bodies based on this template in its annual plan will form the second component. The draft template will be put up for discussion in grama sabhas and ward sabhas. A 20-member local resource group will be formed in local bodies to assist working groups. The template will be approved by district planning committee and will be forwarded to district-level disaster management authority.

The template will contain seven chapters which will deal with basic data of a local body, possibilities of disaster and analysis, disaster management plan, preparation, alleviation and social empowerment, potential, climate-based disaster alleviation project and contact details.

Public assets in each ward will be recorded for arranging disaster management camps. Records on health institutions, anganwadis, basic infrastructure, community centres, educational institutions will also be recorded.

The project document prepared as part of Rebuild Kerala initiative has stressed the need to envisage development projects focusing on possibilities of disaster as well. The history of disasters in each ward will also be recorded like human casualties, damaged houses, damaged infrastructure, agriculture loss and loss of livelihood.

For the past week, sewage has been overflowing near the government primary school in Galbalguda , Tadban.

I request the authorities concerned to repair all faulty manholes and keep the area clean — Mohammed Akram

Perpetual nightmare

The stretch between Malik Motors and MMR Gardens, abutting NH-44 in Old Bowenpally is devoid of any streetlight. Pedestrians and commuters travelling on the stretch during night have to depend on the illumination from the shops owned by automobile distributors on the slip road. However, once these shops close their shutters, those commuting on the stretch are worried about their safety. People travelling on this stretch are vulnerable to crimes. I request civic authorities to will look into the issue — Jyothi R

Garbage menace

Garbage is being dumped in an open plot near Daffodils Apartment in Nethaji Nagar , Kapra. A garbage bin was placed in the open plot right in the middle of two apartments and this is encouraging people to dump garbage in the area. This poses a serious health hazard to residents of the apartments as well as others living in the colony. The owners have failed to erect a wall or construct a fence to put an end to the menace. I urge the authorities to remove the bin from the open plot and build a fence around the area — N Nagarajan

Plying without permit

Autorickshaws from other districts are plying on city roads and authorities are turning a blind eye to the issue. Many vehicles are plying on roads without permit with impunity, adding to pollution and traffic congestion. Police and civic officials should focus on stopping auto drivers without permits from riding on city roads — Utkash Jain

Panaji: Goa Lokayukta justice P K Misra on Monday observed that mining companies that have been indicted in the Shah Commission report and the public account committee (PAC) report, and those that have been involved in illegal mining activities should not be considered for renewal or grant of mining leases if allegations against them are proven.

“Unless and until the inquiry initiated pursuant to the judgment and order of the Supreme Court of India against those mine lease holders found to be violating either Rule 37 or Rule 38 of the Mineral Concession (MC) Rules 1960, or otherwise indicted in the report of the justice Shah Commission/PAC report, or found to be engaged in any kind of illegality, and those involved in illegal mining activities shall not be considered for renewal of the mining leases,” the Lokayukta’s order stated.

Misra further stated, “In our view, if these violations of Rule 37 of the MC Rules are allowed, there shall be substantial leakage of revenue and mining operations cannot be effectively regulated and controlled by the state government. The state government, therefore, must initiate action against those mining leases that violate Rule 37 of the MC Rules.”

The Lokayukta stated that those mining lease holders who have paid stamp duty and where no violations are found in terms of the justice Shah inquiry/PAC report, should be considered for renewal.

SALEM: Former Mylapore MLA K N Lakshmanan on Tuesday corrected actor Rajnikanth, saying pictures of Rama and Seetha naked were not paraded during the anti-superstition rally that was organized by social reformer Periyar E V Ramasamy in Salem city in 1971.

“Those pictures were placed on the dais and not taken during the rally,” he said.

Meanwhile, the veteran actor on Tuesday refused to tender an apology or express regret over his remarks that he made at the 50th anniversary celebrations of Thuglak magazine in Chennai recently.

Rajnikanth also said Lakshmanan, a native of Salem, had staged a protest, condemning the rally that was organized by Periyar.

Lakshmanan said more than 500 people had participated in the anti-superstition rally, by displaying pictures of all deities, including those of Rama and Seetha.

“Those were not naked pictures of deities as the actor had said, but they were garlanded with sandals. They had also beaten those pictures with sandals,” he said.

The former MLA said his Bharathiya Jan Sangam had strongly condemned the rally and raised slogans against Periyar.

When asked about the case that was filed by the Bharathiya Jan Sangam, Lakshmanan said he was the first witness in that case, while Cho, founder editor of Thuglak magazine, was the second witness.

“The case was, however, dismissed by court citing lack of evidence to prove our side.”

ERODE: The season of rekla races is upon us. In a small panchayat town of Sivagiri in Erode district , a 33-year-old man is busy manufacturing carts throughout the year. Vijaya Natarajan works hard as he gets orders for carts from almost all the southern states.

“Earlier, more than 10 people were involved with this. But at present, I am the only one making these teak wood carts,” Vijay Natarajan , told TOI. There is a huge demand for my carts in the market, he adds.

The four types of rekla carts in the market are chariot cart, four people katta cart, cycle katta and cage katta. Of them, cycle katta is usually used for rekla races in Tamil Nadu.

Rekla cart is usually made up of teak, prosopis juliflora (a type of shrub) and sal woods.

“But, I only use teak wood,” he said, adding that, teak wood is strong and weighs less in comparison to other wood logs.

The rekla participants are able to win competitions as his carts are sturdy and can tackle the opposing wind, he says confidently. “The horse or the bull doesn’t get tired because of the cart weight and as a result, runs fast,” he said.

Vijay Natarajan get orders from the entire Kongu region and also from other southern districts. Next to Tamil Nadu, he also gets orders from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka.

He takes at least four months to make a new cart. He sells it at a starting price of Rs 65,000 which can go up to one lakh rupees, depending on the cart’s size and work. People also ask him to make a cart to place it in their houses as a symbol of pride.

Vijay Natarajan further shared that getting labourers to make rekla cart is one of the biggest challenges. “I can’t get a labourer even though I am ready to give a decent pay,” he said, lamenting that this field will be lost after him.

AHMEDABAD: The fire in the seven-storey market Raghuveer Complex building in Surat on Tuesday, brought to focus the issue of fire safety equipment in high-rise buildings. In Ahmedabad city, of 2,700-odd such buildings, around 40% still do not hold valid no-objection certificates from the fire department.A senior officer in the Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) said around 800 of such buildings are commercial ones. Officials said about 30% of residential highrises and 40% of residential-cum-commercial buildings have still have not got fire safety NOCs. Officials say that as these are residential buildings, they can only issue notices and not seal the buildings or slap hefty fines on them.Asking not to be named, the officer said there is a serious lack of political will on this issue, and thus officials are unable to take strict action. The officer said that in 2018, after a review meeting with AFES officials, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) told them to submit a report on fire safety violations in the city. AMC officials then told the fire department to target the 800-odd commercial high-rise buildings. In August 2018, AFES officials were told to draw up a list of buildings that have not renewed their licences or have installed faulty equipment.A drive was taken up and several buildings were issued notices and told to renew their fire safety NOCs. However, 18 months after the drive, officials still say that 30% of the residential high-rises in the city do not have valid NOCs.Fire officials said that of the 778-sanctioned posts in the fire department, some 39% are vacant. The number of sanctioned posts have also not been revised despite the growing AMC limits. The officer said that the city has one fireman per 21,683 people.Officials said that while the AMC makes recruitments as the corporation’s limits increase, the fire department is totally ignored. Apart from this, no less than 20 firemen are deputed to the corporation as security personnel.AMC standing committee chairman Amul Bhatt said, “Fire safety is one issue which has been neglected by the people. We issue notices but cannot seal them as they are occupied.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73505636,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-622892,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/40-of-city-highrises-not-fire-safe/articleshow/73501062.cms

Buy wine from beer shops now, suspense over prices

LUCKNOW: The state cabinet approved new excise policy for 2020-2021 and raised licence fee for liquor shops with senior officials claiming this won’t trigger a price hike. The government has set a target of Rs 31,600 crore in excise collection in 2020-21.The price of country liquor will, however, go up with the cost of each pouch rising to Rs 50 from Rs 45. Compared to the basic fee in 2019-2020, the licence fee for coming financial year has been increased by 10% for country liquor shops, 15% for beer shops and 20% for foreign liquor vends.Among the new provisions of the policy, licence fee will be charged to serve liquor in luxury trains and cruises within the state, which was earlier free. Licences will be given to airport lounges and hotels outside the airport.Under the new policy , it will also be possible to purchase wine from beer shops besides vends selling Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL).Despite official claim, the UP Liquor Traders’ Association office-bearers said prices will eventually go up once the excise policy document is released. Association secretary, K L Maurya said, “In 2019, the cabinet note said very little, but when the policy was finally implemented, several provisions introduced led to price hike. We cannot rule out a similar situation this year as well since the government has increased both the margin money for traders and licence fee.”Association president S P Singh said, “As per available details, there seems to be no direct impact on price of liquor for consumers as increase in licence fee will be borne by dealers since prices are fixed by government and dealers cannot pass on these costs to consumers.”In other major change, the policy will enable availability of liquor throughout the year. The policy also aims to promote microbreweries by reducing duty on draught beer, besides rationalizing the duty structure on super premium brands of liquor to bring prices down at competitive levels with the neighbouring states.“To ensure competitiveness with other states, we have reduced the excise duty on one bulk litre of draught beer from Rs 150 to Rs 60. This will promote microbreweries in state and will lead to reduction in price,” said Sanjay Bhoosreddy, principal secretary, excise.Similarly, super premium brands of liquor costing Rs 5,000 per bottle and above will become slightly cheaper due to rationalisation of duty structure.“There is a differential duty structure based on category of liquor. Since the duty was very high on super premium brands, including largely imported whiskeys, the state was losing revenue as purchase was being made from neighbouring states,” Bhoosreddy explained.“It has therefore been decided that just for the super premium variety, the state will rationalise the duty and bring prices at par with other states,” he added.The other major change being implemented through the policy is ensuring availability of liquor throughout the year. Usually, several brands and varieties would run out of stock at the start of new financial year due to the licensing process.Under the new policy, a vendor will be able to carry forward the left over stock on March 31 and sell it from the next day. The vendor will have to register the left over stock, and pay the difference in duty as per the new policy and a carryover charge. To ensure availability of beer in this period, vendors will be able to start stocking beer from February 15, 2020.The new policy has also simplified rules for issuing licenses and their renewal by making the process online. The allocation of licences will now take place through e-lottery. To end monopoly and break cartelisation in the trade, one person can now be given licence for only two liquor shops in state, as opposed to 150 earlier. The use of QR code has been made mandatory which means that all bottles will be barcoded. This has been done to ensure transparency and availability of best quality liquor, said Bhoosreddy.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73506760,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-103442,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cabinet-nod-to-excise-policy-licence-fee-up-by-15-for-beer/articleshow/73502210.cms

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala with the parents of Allan Shuhaib at their house in Kozhikode on Tuesday

KOZHIKODE: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has asked chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to reveal details of evidence in his possession to assert that Allan Shuhaib and Thwaha Fasal , the CPM workers who were arrested under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act ( UAPA ), have links with Maoists.

Speaking to reporters after visiting the houses of the arrested youths here on Tuesday, Chennithala said he will raise the issue again in the assembly. “My party workers in Kozhikode were not in favour of my visit to the houses of the CPM workers, but I intervened because it is a human rights issue. My intention is not to draw political mileage from the issue,” he said.

Chennithala said prima facie there seems to be some procedural errors in imposing the UAPA on the youth. “There are some stipulations before slapping UAPA and I think they were not followed in this case,” he said. The Congress leader said this is the attitude of the BJP government. “Then what is the difference between Amit Shah and Pinarayi Vijayan,’ he asked.

Allan’s parents Muhammad Shuhaib and Sabitha Sekhar told the Opposition leader that police conducted search around 4am without any warrant. “Police had written that it was a UAPA case even before they came to our house. They wanted me to sign at the bottom of a paper, half of which was blank and I asked them to put a cross mark before signing,” Shuhaib said. “We expected help from the party we trusted, but it came as a shock when they abandoned us,” he added.

Sabitha later said Chennithala’s visit was a relief. “He promised to raise the issue in assembly,” she said.

Thwaha’s brother Ijas said the government should consider taking the case back from the National Investigation Agency (NIA). “I am told that there is a provision in the law. NIA took over the case at a time the high court was considering the bail petition,” he said.

Deputy opposition leader M K Muneer also visited their houses on Monday, raising the possibility of the UDF taking over the issue.

Meanwhile, a convention will be held here on Thursday demanding the withdrawal of UAPA slapped on Allan and Thwaha.

Murali Kannamballi, C K Abdul Azeez and others will attend the meeting.

House visit for political mileage: Surendran

BJP state general secretary K Surendran has said Chennithala visiting the homes of Allan and Thwaha was a ‘cheap attempt to draw political mileage’.

Talking to reporters in Kozhikode on Tuesday, Surendran claimed that Congress was trying to ‘communalize’ a case related to terrorism.

“By jumping into the fray, UDF is trying to compete with LDF in a case which is prima facie linked to extremism as noted by court,” he said.

Surendran added that UDF is whitewashing extremists by helping the accused. “A few days ago, a policeman was killed by extremists at Kaliyikkavila, but Chennithala did not have time to visit his place. Congress or UDF didn’t utter a word about the incident though the accused were arrested from Kerala ,” he said.

“UDF is intervening with the intent to create a communal polarization in the state. The Congress leader is trying to fish in troubled waters,” he claimed.

Ahmedabad: The Gujarat Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2013, and Gujarat Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measure rules, 2014, had made it mandatory for municipal corporations to register fire protection consultants. But Ahmedabad is yet to begin the registration process.

The state government had made registration of consultants compulsory in October 2019. Surat has already published the list of registered consultants and Vadodara has issued an advertisement for registrations. Ahmedabad is yet to act.

According to the Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services, the role of the consultants is to certify that highrises adhere to fire safety norms. Only after this step can highrises get building-use permissions.

Officials said that the certification is essential for even the renewal of the fire department’s no-objection certificate (NOC).

An official said that it has come to light that many buildings with the fire NOC have malfunctioning safety equipment. In some cases, the equipment has been stolen. Citing the examples of two buildings — one in Prahladnagar and another in Gota — officials said that both had an NOC, but when they were hit by fire, it emerged that the safety equipment was missing or malfunctioning.

The officials said that most parts of the equipment are removed and only the pipelines remain to fool the inspectors.

394,['22/01/2020'],Tell police to protect people from dogs: PIL,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday issued notice to the state government, city police commissioner and the municipal commissioner, in response to a PIL demanding that police action against the increasing stray dog menace.

The petitioner advocate, Kirtikuamr Bhatt from Bopal, sought HC directions to the government and city police commissioner to use the police force to curb the menace of stray dogs. He argued that under the provisions of Gujarat Police Act, police authorities are responsible for the safety of citizens. “The law makes them responsible for ensuring the safety of citizens, not only from human beings, but also from all sources of danger,” the petitioner contended.

The petitioner argued that the free roaming dogs have the potential to cause danger to the life and health of the people. While this is an issue of public health with thousands of people in danger of rabies, it is the responsibility of the state government to prevent dog attacks. He submitted that packs of ‘man-eater’ stray dogs roam free on the streets and the victims are mainly poor and middle-class citizens, children, the infirm and the elderly.

The petitioner cited various news reports along with a figure of 60,292 cases of dog bite reported between November 2017 and October 2018 to emphasize the scale of the menace. He claimed that the total number of dog-bite cases was 30,026 in 2010. He argued that cases of dog bites in Ahmedabad are on the rise and the dog population management programme has proven a failure. The animal birth control programme for dogs has also failed, the petitioner claimed and argued that the police must act to protect people from dog attacks.

395,['22/01/2020'],Ahmedabad: Insurer told to pay Rs 14 lakh to widow,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: A consumer court hear has pulled up an insurance company for betraying a widow by wrongfully denying her husband’s death claim and ordered it to pay the insurance amount of Rs 14 lakh to her along with compensation for litigation cost and causing her shock and pain.

This happened because the insurance company denied death claim to the widow on the ground that her husband had already committed suicide before it received the proposal for life insurance policy. The policy was obtained in the name of a dead person.

The woman challenged the insurer’s repudiation and won the case. The Ahmedabd District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum has permitted the widow to recover Rs 14 lakh within 30 days from the insurance company along with Rs 20,000 towards legal expenditure and compensation for shock and pain caused to her due to wrong rejection on part of the insurer.

In this case, Prahladsinh Solanki from a villager near Dehgam had bought Rs 14-lakh life cover from Exide Life Insurance Co India Ltd in form of its ING Term Life Plus Plan. The policy was issued on November 27, 2013. In February 2014, Solanki’s wife, Bhavnaben, applied for death claim saying that her husband passed away on February 1, 2014 because of diarrhoea and supplied a death certificate issued by Prathmik Arogya Kendra, Gandhinagar.

In March 2015, the insurer rejected widow’s claim on the ground that her husband had committed suicide on September 9, 2013. By the time the policy proposal was received and policy was issued, he had already died. The policy was issued in the name of a dead person.

Bhavnaben sued the insurer. After hearing the case, the consumer court said that the insurer had not provided any opportunity to the widow before repudiation and hence its decision was against the principle of natural justice. The death certificate is very clear.

397,['22/01/2020'],Some traitors store arms in masjids instead of praying there: BJP MLA,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Davanagere/ Mysuru: Two senior BJP functionaries, who are part of chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s government, courted controversy on Tuesday while provocative speeches on terrorism and mosques.

In Mysuru, deputy chief minister Govind Karjol said ""terrorists only come from Pakistan"", while Honnalli legislator MP Renukacharya, also political secretary to the chief minister, suggested some Muslims run masjids only to ""store arms and ammunition"".

""There are no Hindu terrorists. I never heard the word Hindu terrorism,"" Karjol said in Mysuru. ""Terrorists only come from Pakistan.""

Meanwhile, speaking at a Citizenship (Amendment) Act awareness campaign in his constituency in Davanagere district, Renukacharya said, ""There are some anti-nationals who give fatwas from masjids. Do you conduct prayers inside masjids? No, instead you store arms and ammunition there. Is this the reason for running masjids?""

He also urged Muslims to visit mutts and temples, saying, ""You will only get prasadam and thirtha (holy water) and nothing else."" He went on to say, ""You (Muslims) killed our youth who opposed cow slaughter and you expect us to be silent? It is impossible.’’

The Honnalli MLA also criticised Congress and JD(S) for supporting the minority community. ""Your workers [of the two parties] have become jobless. People no longer attend your political meetings. You support the minority community and mock [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi, Yediyurappa, and [state BJP president Nalin Kumar] Kateel. You expect us to stay mum? After Modiji became the Prime Minister, no incident of communal riot has been reported. Peace was restored,"" Renukacharya said.

Citing an example to justify his comments, he said, ""Davanagere sitting MP GM Siddeshwar and I got only 500 to 600 Muslim votes in the last three elections. Even then, without discrimination, we gave lakhs of rupees in grants to shaadi mahals and masjids. Yediyurappa too has given over Rs 250 crore in grants, but why do Muslims still hate BJP? It is the most unfortunate thing.""

Recently, Ballari City MLA Somashekara Reddy of the BJP made similar controversial remarks at a pro-citizenship law rally in Ballari. He threatened those opposing CAA, asking them to think of the ""consequences"" if members of the majority community take to the streets against them.

""We are 80%, you are 17%,"" Reddy had said. ""If we react, what will be your situation? Be careful."" Reddy was booked for the speech.

Dehradun: Hundreds of men, women and children from minority community had to call off their protest in city’s Reetha Mandi locality after police denied them permission to strike in the locality park here on Tuesday.

While the community members claimed that they had sought prior permission from departments concerned, police said that the city has a designated ‘dharna sthal’ and whoever wants to protest should sit at that spot and not at any random location.

On the lines of Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, hundreds of Muslim men, women and children, on the call of local ward corporator, Congress’s Itaat Khan, gathered at MDDA Park situated at city’s Nehru colony on Tuesday morning. Around 300 protesters also started raising anti-government slogans and demanded that the both Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) should be revoked immediately.

However, barely 30 minutes into the protest, police teams reached the park and asked them to call off the dharna immediately saying that they were not given permission to organise such a large gathering.

Speaking to TOI, Itaat Khan said that they had sought permission from various departments. “We had approached the district administration, the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority and even police but we were denied permission citing one reason or the either. I was also told that there is no space available at dharna sthal, following which, we decided to organise a peaceful protest at the park,” Khan said.

Khan added that they had informed the administration that they would be holding a peaceful protest from 10 am to 5 pm every day. He said, “The administration is not ready to give us place anywhere and I was even threatened by the people in power. This is nothing but misuse of power by the government. Also, we were protesting at one side of the park and there was enough space for children to play.”

Meanwhile, SP city Shweta Chaubey told TOI that the protesters who had gathered at Reetha Mandi were already informed that they were not supposed to protest at any random location.

She said, “If people start organising at any random location, it will be too difficult for us to maintain law and order. Also, we have dharna sthal for the purpose and the same organisation had protested there for two days. They can protest there again.”

Garbage dumped on one of the cycle tracks in the city

CHANDIGARH: The chronic garbage dumps along the cycle tracks in city beautiful have been re-occurring and residents believe that those dumping garbage at such spots with impunity must be penalised.

Marshals must be deployed at such spots to discourage people from dumping garbage there.

Such deliberations were made by a local environmentalist Budaniya L R in his letter to the UT administration demanding that strict action must be taken against those found littering cycle tracks and other places with garbage.

He said, “It has been observed that garbage re-occurs at such points making them chronic garbage dumping spots. We need to identify people littering garbage at such spots and penalise them or discourage them for doing so. For this, the UT must deploy marshals at such spots for some time and once those throwing garbage are discouraged, they can be withdrawn, and it is believed that garbage may not return thereafter.”

Another resident of Sector 21 and daily cycle rider Amarjit Singh said, “I have been using this cycle track till Sukhna Lake . On the 6km to 8 km stretch, we encounter three garbage dumps, building material and cut branches. They are dangerous for cycle riders. It has been observed that after the MC removes such dumps, they re-occur. The UT administration must find ways to stop people from throwing garbage at such spots.”

Garbage dumps, potholes and poor lighting of the ambitious cycle tracks project of the UT administration has made these tracks a filthy ride in the city. Ardent cycle riders find poor management on the part of the UT administration and have termed the concept a formality to complete paperwork than to promote the same.

Cycle tracks in many parts of the city have been neglected by the UT administration and are marred with garbage dumps, construction material waste, dug up earth and dark spots which not only discourages the cycle rider to use such tracks, but also poses major threat to environment as well as riders.

Chandigarh Cycle Riders Club member, Gurjasjit Singh, said, “The UT administration has done a formality to construct these cycle tracks as they have left them at the behest of the almighty to upkeep. We face garbage dumps, dumping of construction waste, dug up land, and dark spots on tracks which discourage the cycle riders. Once which was praised by the UT administrator as well as Chandigarh MP, the cycle tracks concept has become self-discouraging instead of motivating people to use cycle tracks.”

He said we believe that the UT administration must take pains to up-keep these cycle tracks for which public money has been spent.

KOCHI: The high court on Tuesday issued a stay on Kasaragod district panchayat ’s move to pass a resolution against Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ).

Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan V issued an interim order granting a stay for three weeks after considering a petition filed by K Shreekanth, ward member of Edaneer and BJP Kasaragod district president, through advocate V Sajith Kumar.

It was contended by the petitioner that the resolution proposed for the meeting to be held on January 23 is clearly in violation of Kerala Panchayat Raj (Procedure for Panchayat Meeting) Rules, 1995. The proposed resolution relates to a matter under adjudication before the Supreme Court and is therefore against Rule 13(4), the petitioner had argued.

In the order, the high court said, “Having considered the admissions advanced, I am of the view that the petitioner has made out a case for issuance of an interim order...” Scheduling a hearing after three weeks, the court has sought the views of the state government, Kasaragod district panchayat and its president, and Fareeda Sakir Ahamed, chairperson of the standing committee for public works of the district panchayat. The resolution, proposed by Fareeda, was to demand that the central government should repeal CAA and desist from implementing NRC or NPR.

Lucknow: After TOI reported about cases where vehicle owners with FASTag ended up paying toll tax twice, the government has taken steps to change the situation.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) Uttar Pradesh chapter has mooted a proposal which says that if a vehicle with FASTag faces a technical glitch at a toll plaza, it will not have to make cash payment.

Server error and failure to scan the tag are also conditions under which a car will be exempt from cash payment.

According to NHAI officials, the proposal is yet to be finalized by a committee of top officials. According to records from NHAI, more than 3,000 vehicles pass through a toll plaza daily in the city. Of this, only 50% of the vehicles have FASTags. The remaining take the cash lane. FASTag project manager AN Giri said, “The proposal has been mooted. If it is accepted by senior officials, we will let vehicles with FASTag pass through without a cash payment if they face technical problems from our end.”

Several motorists with FASTag had faced the issue at toll plazas. The operator would tell them that the toll amount had not been deducted from their prepaid FASTag wallet and would ask them to pay cash instead. However, after a few minutes, motorists would receive a message of toll deduction from their e-wallet.

Server-related complaints had also poured in with NHAI. Motorists said they were made to take the cash lane after a long wait in the FASTag lane.

TOI has been continuously highlighting problems faced by motorists using FASTag.

Chandigarh: The Police Complaint Authority (PCA) has written to the UT administrator against the police department for not providing them necessary documents in a case pertaining to dentist Mohit Dhawan fraud case, on Tuesday.

In its communication to the administrator, the PCA accused SSP UT that she was directed to make available certain documents to the PCA on December 12, 2019.

On behalf of the UT police department, inspector Dilbagh appeared before the PCA court.

Senior superintendent of police, UT Chandigarh, was directed to make available certain documents to the authority as the documents were necessary for reaching a just conclusion in the complaint.

However, the documents were produced and Inspector Dilbagh Singh on instructions from SSP, UT Chandigarh, stated that the authorities had not taken a decision on producing the said documents before the PCA.

In his letter to the administration, the PCA mentioned that similar situation raised in the complaint made by Yuvraj Singh against cop Jaspal Singh in December last year. The PCA had issued directions to the police department to produce some documents in the case and the police did not comply with the PCA orders.

Charanjit Singh Virk, DSP, PRO, UT said, “We are in process of examining orders. We will take appropriate decision keeping in view all facts.”

Mohit Dhawan, Sector 21-based dentist, had filed a complaint against Ashwani Atri, then SHO of Sector 19 police station, and inquiry officer Balwinder Singh, for implicating him in a false cheating case on the complaint of Gretrude D’Souza, US national.

Gretrude D’Souza had alleged that she was cheated of Rs 7 lakh by the dentist in 2018 on the pretext of a “dental tourism package”.

The dentist had alleged to the UT vigilance that the US national was close to former CBI’s special director Rakesh Asthana and due to his influence, former DGP T S Luthra and other cops harassed him.

During inspection, LDA officials found that building owners had either constructed the entire premises without approval of map from the development authority or were not following fire safety norms.

Officials also found that in some cases, commercial unit owners had given out the basement for commercial use, flouting fire safety norms. Under the rules, basement is only meant for parking.

According to LDA records, prominent areas where illegal buildings have come up over the past five years are Indiranagar (136 cases), Gomtinagar (75), Aashiana (68), Alambagh (56), Charbagh (73) and Nakhas (62).

The development authority has also faced losses of around Rs 70 crore because of the violators.

“The development authority has set a target of sealing or demolishing 100 illegal commercial units by the end of this month,” said an LDA official.

Any trip to the Hermit Kingdom warrants sensitivity trainings, vital to survive even for a short visit. Divergence from set rules can result in devastating consequences.

Armed with stamped paper visas, we landed at Pyongyang International Airport, from Beijing. Personal effects were checked for political, religious and pornographic content. We were then transported to a foreigners-only hotel, passports & visas taken away, with assurances that they would be returned when we exited. Inside the hotel, we could roam freely, but were barred from leaving the premises.

Each group had two ‘minders’ who hung around ubiquitously. There was a single channel TV, devoted to the greatness of their military, apart from extolling the virtues of Kim Jong-un. With no internet access or much global communication connectivity, one feels isolated. Interaction with locals was taboo, even when one got off the bus.

From every street corner or building, Kim II-sung, and Kim Jong-il, stared down at you. At Mansudae Grand Monument, enormous bronze statues of the two past presidents overlook the city. It’s a compulsion that one bows down in deep reverence and presents a bouquet of flowers to the leaders. Photography was subject to scrutiny by the ‘minders’.

The highlight of the trip was the visit to the most militarized space in the world — DMZ or Demilitarized Zone. A narrow road demarcated the two Koreas, and security was on premium on either side. We were taken to the roof of a building overlooking the border. The stone-faced North Korean guards suddenly started making merry. A senior security person walked in and remarked, “See, how happy we are in North Korea . The security personnel on the other side are so sad. They want to cross over, but the Americans have instructed the South Korean government that none should defect to the plentiful North.”

The state-managed show is most evident at Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where embalmed bodies of the father and grandfather of the present president are kept. As one enters the sanctum of the mausoleum, each group is mysteriously joined by wailing women, who appear out of nowhere.

With school children forced to do march pasts almost every other day in front of their great leaders, life is dark. A simple week-long visit opened our eyes to a possible world behind the screen. But at the end of the day, they were wonderful hosts.

Representative image

PANAJI: The Afghan student community in Goa no longer feels safe after a fellow Goa University (GU) student was stabbed by miscreants on Sunday night after an altercation. On Tuesday, they labeled the incident a “hate crime”.

President of the Association of International Students studying at GU, Abdul Basit, also an Afghan, said they have not received as much support from the university after the stabbing as they had expected. Basit said the case should be investigated as an ‘attempt to murder’ as the knife had missed rupturing the victim, Matiullah Aria’s, kidney by just an inch. He said the vice-chancellor should pressurise police into expediting an inquiry.

Goa University’s local students said that they too felt unsafe on campus now due to it not being an enclosed one.

The injured student is among 30 others from Afghanistan studying at Goa University under the government of India’s Indian Council of Cultural Relationship (ICCR) programme, Basit said.

“Until now, we had felt safe in Goa. But from now onwards, we do not know if it is safe or not. Better security of international students must be ensured. We were shocked to hear about the incident and do not feel secure. We feel what happened was a hate crime because Aria was asked by the accused where he is from, what he was doing there, how he could have a bike being an outsider and then he was stabbed,” said Basit. He added that though the crime did not take place on the GU campus, the incident occurred very close to the campus and the victim was verbally abused and assaulted as well before being stabbed.

The victim’s friend, Mohammad Rahim, said Aria had gone alone to a ‘view point’ in Dona Paula, very close to the GU campus, on his friend’s bike. When he was leaving the spot, Rahim’s bike slipped. Three men approached him and began bullying him. As the altercation heated up, Aria was stabbed.

He is still recuperating in the ICU at a private hospital close to campus. “Goa University registrar Y V Reddy and in-charge of foreign students Rahul Tripathi met him in the hospital,” Rahim said.

President of Goa University Postgraduate Students’ Union Sanmesh Shet said that initially only one accused was arrested by the police when four were involved. “Though we now believe that two more have been held, one is still to be arrested. If the inquiry is not expedited in the next two days, all university students will take a morcha to the police station. Goa University officials must pursue the case themselves with police. These students have come to Goa University from another country and we have to respect them and make them feel secure,” said Shet.

KOCHI: Tense situation prevailed on Tuesday at two churches — St Mary’s Church in Odakkali and Marthoma Cheriyapally at Kothamangalam — where believers, including women and children, had assembled in large numbers to prevent police from taking over of the churches as per court directives.

Police and district administration have court orders asking them to take over the churches. At St Mary’s Church, police could not implement the court directive till late night on Tuesday because of the presence of a large number of people belonging to the Jacobite faction. K Karthik, SP, Ernakulam Rural, said they are holding talks with church leaders to facilitate a smooth takeover.

The magistrate court in Perumbavoor had given them time till January 22 to implement the order, failing which the station house officer of Kuruppampady police station and SP have to appear in person at the court. “There are a lot of people here and the situation is not conducive for implementing the court order,” said a police official on the spot.

The order was issued after the SP sought more time to implement the order which the court declined, saying the reasons stated were unsatisfactory and police can make reasonable use of force to execute the decision.

RDO Muvattupuzha Anilkumar M T held discussions with leaders of Jacobite faction at Marthoma Cheriyapalli, where Matha Maitri Samrakshana Samiti has been holding a relay protest against the takeover for the last 48 days. On Tuesday, around 2,500 people assembled on the premises of the church anticipating police action. Officials of the district administration said they requested church leaders to vacate the premises but they refused. The district administration has to execute the order before January 23.

The Ernakulam district collector had directed the Jacobite faction to surrender the keys of Marthoma Cheriyapally and auxiliary institutions on its premises on December 31. The order was issued pursuant to a high court directive.

Solar-geothermal hybrid model

AHMEDABAD: After setting up a geothermal energy plant at Dholera last year, the Centre of Excellence for Geothermal Energy (CEGE) at PDPU will experiment with solar-geothermal hybrid model to improve energy output at the site. The plant is likely to be functional later this year.

Prof Anirbid Sircar, the head of the CEGE, said that a researcher at the centre is working on bimodal parabolic trough collector (PTC) design. “The PTC can collect solar energy for 7 to 8 hours a day whereas geothermal energy will be available round the clock,” he said. “Both the modes will be assimilated for amalgamated power generation. We believe that the capacity will increase from the current 20 kilowatts/hour (kWh) for geothermal to 50-60 kWh in the hybrid mode.” Sircar said that a conceptual model has been developed.

Sircar was speaking on the sidelines of 4th International Geothermal Conference at PDPU on Tuesday. The conference was organized on theme of ‘Harnessing and Hybridization’. National and international experts participated at the event.

“CEGE has identified Unai and Gandhar in the state along with Dholera for their potential to harness geothermal energy,” said Sircar. “Temperature conditions at Unai are found to be better with the possibility of getting 100 kWh from the site. Helium is also found at the site.” Other speakers at the event included Dr Kunezes Dolma from the United Nations University, Iceland, and Dr Hirok Choudhary from NIT Durgapur.

JD(U) patriarch HD Deve Gowda

BENGALURU: Battered by a series of electoral debacles and internal strife, the JD(S) is desperately aiming at a turnaround, with patriarch HD Deve Gowda convening a meeting of party workers on Thursday at Palace Grounds in Bengaluru to revive the party.

The meeting is being held ahead of gram panchayat elections — scheduled for April — and Gowda hopes to leverage grassroot level workers and prepare them for the polls. Although gram panchayat polls are not fought on party symbols, they are a platform for parties to organise cadres and strengthen their support base. The JD(S) has a good track record in these polls, especially in the Vokkaliga belt of South Karnataka .

“We want the gram panchayat elections to be a fresh beginning,” said JD(S) MLC TA Sharavana, who was appointed national executive member of the party on Tuesday. “The party workers conference will be a booster dose.”

JD(S) is still reeling from a series of reversals. In the Lok Sabha elections last year, it lost Mandya, its citadel, to political greenhorn Sumalatha Ambareesh and then failed to win even one assembly seat in the 15 that went to bypolls in November last year.

However, senior functionaries take heart from the party’s tally in the legislature —34 MLAs and 14 MLCs. “We are still not completely out. Rivals can write off JD(S) at their own peril,” said HK Kumaraswamy, JD(S) state president. “We are introspecting on the losses and the JD(S) will bounce back.”

JD(S) has been heavily criticized for being Gowda family-centric, five of whom are either MLAs or MPs. Seniors say Gowda is ready to rectify this error and has promised to decentralise power soon.

While the threat of a mass exodus of JD(S) MLAs to BJP and Congress looms large, a process initiated by JD(U) leader Mahima Patel to create an alternative platform by reviving the old Janata Parivar may have also prompted the corrective measures in the JD(S). Patel has called a meeting of “like-minded leaders” from across parties on January 30 and several JD(S) functionaries are expected to participate.

“We have taken note of the development. But, I don’t think efforts to revive the old Janata Parivar will ever be successful,” said former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy.

Although gram panchayat polls are not fought on party symbols, they are a platform for parties to organise cadres and strengthen their support base. The JD(S) has a good track record in these polls, especially in the Vokkaliga belt of South Karnataka .

“We want the gram panchayat elections to be a fresh beginning,” said JD(S) MLC TA Sharavana, who was appointed national executive member of the party on Tuesday. “The party workers conference will be a booster dose.”

JD(S) is still reeling from a series of reversals. In the Lok Sabha elections last year, it lost Mandya, its citadel, to political greenhorn Sumalatha Ambareesh and then failed to win even one assembly seat in the 15 that went to bypolls in November last year.

However, senior functionaries take heart from the party’s tally in the legislature —34 MLAs and 14 MLCs. “We are still not completely out. Rivals can write off JD(S) at their own peril,” said HK Kumaraswamy, JD(S) state president. “We are introspecting on the losses and the JD(S) will bounce back.”

JD(S) has been heavily criticized for being Gowda family-centric, five of whom are either MLAs or MPs. Seniors say Gowda is ready to rectify this error and has promised to decentralise power soon.

While the threat of a mass exodus of JD(S) MLAs to BJP and Congress looms large, a process initiated by JD(U) leader Mahima Patel to create an alternative platform by reviving the old Janata Parivar may have also prompted the corrective measures in the JD(S). Patel has called a meeting of “like-minded leaders” from across parties on January 30 and several JD(S) functionaries are expected to participate.

“We have taken note of the development. But, I don’t think efforts to revive the old Janata Parivar will ever be successful,” said former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy.

Ramesh Chennithala

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala wrote a third letter to governor Arif Mohammad Khan against the government’s plan to go ahead with the delimitation process in local bodies . In his letter, Chennithala said delimitation went against the census law and the recommendations of the fourth finance commission.

He pointed out the same to Khan, who refused to sign the ordinance of the government to reorganize local bodies, and asked him to consider these factors. With the government approving the draft of the bill for the delimitation of wards and since it likely to be presented before the assembly session beginning on January 30, Chennithala sought Khan’s intervention once again.

As per the directive issued by the high court on January 7, 2020 the reorganization of wards can be carried out only after census process is complete. Defying this directive, state government has decided to go ahead with the delimitation exercise, he said.

In a case related to the bifurcation of two grama panchayats that came up in high court on July 7, 2015, the government took a stand that the bifurcation cannot be done since the census process is beginning and a revision of the voters’ list had begun. Following this, the court had directed not to go ahead with the reorganization of these grama panchayats till the census process is complete. This directive is applicable to all wards in state, said Chennithala.

Similarly, the fourth finance commission had made it clear that the delimitation of wards should not be carried out if elections are due in one year. The state government has the responsibility to accept the recommendations, he said in the letter.

The imminent danger facing Ahmedabad’s status today is that a number of listed heritage buildings will be lost... Read More

AHMEDABAD: Two-and half years since Ahmedabad’s walled city was inscribed a World Heritage City by Unesco, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s heritage conservation committee (HCC) and the state urban development department are yet to decide on which portions of the heritage precincts are officially within the walled city.

On top of this, the state government has not acted on repeated pleas by the AMC to appoint new members to the HCC, the state appointed authority for implementing heritage regulations, since 2013.

The imminent danger facing Ahmedabad’s status today is that a number of listed heritage buildings will be lost if the precincts are not defined in time. This is crucial for regulation of construction and repairs on listed private properties designated as ‘world heritage’ in the walled city. A total of 56 precincts were identified, according to the dossier submitted before Unesco, but there is no clarity on whether heritage bylaws and regulations, which have existed since 2007, should be applied to closed clusters of heritage precincts or the entire walled city.

Besides, special precinct guidelines are yet to be formalised by the AMC. “Only 16 points in the guidelines have been agreed on, while a few more are in discussion and are yet to be approved,” said the AMC official.

“The National Institute of Urban Affairs will submit a report on whether heritage regulations be extended to the whole walled city or a few residential clusters. They will also prepare local area plan for the core and buffer zone of the world heritage zone,” says a senior AMC official. The problem for AMC does not end here. The ASI has been repeatedly warning the civic body to ensure that all permitted repair works that are within 100m of some 30 national monuments be stalled.

This is because there is no single window where citizens they can apply for permission for repairs before the AMC and a central authority like the ASI.

423,['22/01/2020'],Night vigil to send CAA message to SC,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Kolkata: A day before Supreme Court hears the petition that argues that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is unconstitutional, protesters started another sit-in in the heart of the city on SN Banerjee Road. Hundreds of women have already been sitting at Park Circus Maidan, which has now come to be known as Kolkata’s Shaheen Bag, since January 7. They have been demanding a total rollback of the CAA.

Protesters at both the venues said they will do an all-night vigil, sing patriotic songs and recite the preamble to the Constitution the whole night, hoping a for a favourable response. Several mass organisations under the Joint Forum Against NRC had issued a call to assemble at Ramlila Ground in Moulali and head to Esplanade for a sit-in to protest against CAA and proposed NRC and NPR. Almost everybody at the protests rally said it was important to hit the streets to send a message to the judiciary about the mood of the country.

“It is now or never. It is important to be out on the streets to send a message that the citizens have not accepted CAA, which the government has imposed on them. A law that may impact millions of people has been formulated and passed without consulting the citizens of the country,” said Bimal Ghosh, a member of the All Bengal Anti-NRC Citizens’ Committee.

Another protester said the uprising of the people against CAA and NRC is not only a warning to the central government but it also has a message for the opposition parties. “The opposition has failed to unite and defend the rights of the citizens. Things have come to such a pass that ordinary citizens decided to hit the streets,” said Mohammad Hasan, a businessman who has been joining protests since Parliament passed CAA last month.

At Park Circus Maidan, protesting women said the intervening night between Tuesday and Wednesday could be the longest for them and the most crucial. “A lot depends on what Supreme Court says on Wednesday. We are hoping the judiciary has been keeping an eye on protests across the country and brutalities on people who have been protesting peacefully in different parts of the country,” said Saira Jabeen, a homemaker from Rifle Range Road in Park Circus. She has been attending the protest at Park Circus Maidan for the past two weeks.

424,['22/01/2020'],MC gives Climategiri kids a taste of world hunger,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Chandigarh: The organizing partners of Monday’s Climategiri event at the Sector-17 plaza have complained to the municipal commissioner that his staff let the participating children go hungry and forgot to honour the actual heroes of this green war.

In Tuesday’s complaint, a copy of which is with TOI, Yuvsatta NGO’s founder-coordinator Pramod Sharma has stated that teachers from St Stephen’s School had given the MC an advance food estimate for 3,500 children. “Only 2003 sandwiches and 1,500 muffins came,” he said, “and even those sandwiches were prepared on site in an unhygienic way and distributed unevenly. The teachers on distribution duty kept screaming at the MC workers to give students their refreshment.”

Sharma claims that St Stephen’s was principal conductor of the Climategiri event and, when time came for the valedictory function, the teachers and students of another school were honoured. He said: “St Stephen’s had supplied the felicitation list of main event partners well in advance for them to receive encouragement from the governor, yet only a few names were announced and nobody even acknowledged the contributions of the others.”

The Yuvsatta coordinator said: “Despite advance notice, the contributors’ and sponsors’ names were missing from the stage backdrop, which had only select logos, of minor sponsors.” The complaint letter to the MC commissioner reads: “We can’t make Chandigarh smart, if we don’t put smart people and smart systems in place. We hope for action,”

I wasn’t the first time that the MC messed up during a big event for environmental conservation. Sharma said: “They did the same on September 11, 2019, when UT adviser Manoj Parida launched the ‘Plastic-Free Chandigarh’ campaign from Sector 17. “After calling hundreds of schoolchildren to a venue that had no seating arrangements and making them stand in the sun for 2 hours, they gave them a banana each. Having brought more than 100 students from a slum and a private school to the place, we felt embarrassed at their treatment.”

Recalling last Gandhi Jayanti, when the governor had flagged off a march from the Punjab and Haryana high court, he said: “At the venue, nobody knew where to go. We were told to walk our group of foreign Peacefest delegates to Bougainvillea Garden with 500 NSS volunteers. For whatever little refreshment was left by the time we got there, we were asked to bring authorization letters from the MC officials, who had run away in front of our eyes. Having harassed us again, these officers leave us no choice but to expose them.” MC’s medical officer of health Dr Amrit Pal said: “There was no issue of refreshment at the venue. Rather, packets were left out. Refreshment was prepared on the site for freshness. We had to stop food distribution for governor’s address. Students had carried tiffins, too.

SALIGAO: Despite the Mapusa municipality’s crackdown on violators found dumping garbage within its jurisdiction, the problem continues unabated after a huge pile of dry waste was spotted at the KTC bus stand .

The heap, comprising mainly plastic bags and bottles, was not collected by the authorities, while adequate dustbins were also missing at the spot.

Councillor Tushar Tople said the people should have civic sense and the garbage should be placed inside the bins that are placed at strategic locations.

“Municipal workers cannot go everywhere to collect garbage,” he said.

The municipality had recently commenced a drive to curb garbage dumping within its jurisdiction and collected fines amounting to Rs 19,200 after penalising over 40 offenders. The civic body had also instructed market inspectors to take strict action against garbage offenders.

Apheel Johnson

KOTTAYAM: The State Human Rights Commission ( SHRC ) has ordered the police to conduct an impartial probe into the death of Apheel Johnson , a student volunteer, who had suffered a fatal brain injury during the state junior sports meet in Pala in October last year.

In his order issued on Tuesday, SHRC chairman Justice Antony directed the police to complete the probe and initiate necessary legal action.

Pala DSP informed the commission that three of the four accused in the case were arrested. A higher secondary official informed the commission that the school officials had not permitted any student to volunteer in the meet.

A police report said neither the school officials nor the education department had any role in the accident. The report, however, clarified that Johnson was a volunteer for the javelin throw event, and he was killed after the hammer hurled by a participant with the permission of the organisers hit him on his forehead.

Mohammed Kasim (referee, throws), T D Martin (chief judge, hammer throw), K V Joseph (judge, hammer throw) and Narayanan Kutty (chief judge, javelin throw) have been arraigned as accused in the case. The police report said the first three were arrested and the investigation was progressing.

Johnson, 17, died on October 21 last while undergoing treatment for the injuries caused by the accident on October 4.

In a unique initiative, Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar answers queries on a range of issues from our readers

Q. Many paying guest accommodations for working women (and men) in the city are located within residential complexes. Is it allowed to run a PG in a residential complex where families are also staying? Also, is there any process wherein a family or bachelor, moving into a rented apartment, need to obtain police permission? — Urooj Kamal

A. As per GHMC norms, any residential area being converted into an area for commercial use, must take prior permission. Whether a particular PG accommodation has taken permission or not, can be checked with GHMC. There is no process or procedure for a family or bachelor, moving into a rented apartment/house, to obtain permission from police. They (tenants) can enter in to a rental agreement with the genuine owners of the house/flat. But, for their safety and security, owners of the house/flat must furnish tenants/paying guest’s information to the local police station.

Q. The growing incidence of crime against women in the city is worrisome. Women are increasingly feeling unsafe and unprotected, especially those working in shifts and hiring cabs late at night to return home. Also, right now, liquor and petrol are easily available and there is hardly any patrolling along deserted highways. I’d like to know what additional safety measures are being adopted by the police to control crime, apart from Dial 100 and Hawk Eye? – Parimala G Tadas

A. The city police have taken various initiatives to curb crime against women: Dial 100 and Hawk eye are being actively implemented. In case of Dial 100 the response time is less than 8 minutes. Also, various awareness programmes are being conducted for gender sensitisation. In case of serious offences involving repeat offenders, suspect sheets are opened and PD Act proposals are sent for stringent action against them. The city police have also established a wide CCTV network across the city. It not only curbs such crimes but the footage also helps in speedy detection of crimes. Other initiatives like, safety audit of public spaces is conducted and necessary action is being taken to make the public, women in particular, feel safe and secure. Apart from that, various teams are patrolling in the city in plain clothes to track miscreants and book cases accordingly.

Q. I am a veteran of the Indian Air Force (Sergeant) and understand that the police often do a thankless job and struggle to satisfy citizens. However, I would want to highlight the issue of overloaded autorickshaws, particularly seven-seaters, that ply on city roads. Not only do they put the lives of the passengers, most of them school children, at risk but are also create nuisance for other motorists. I urge stringent action against them. — AVN Mohan

A. Seven-seater autos are not permitted to enter Hyderabad city limits. They operate within Cyberabad and Rachakonda commissionerate limits. Whenever seven-seater autos enter Hyderabad limits, cases are booked against them. Also, Hyderabad Traffic Police regularly book cases against overloaded autos and organise special drives to stop autos from carrying extra school children. This apart, they send messages to parents asking them not to send their children in overloaded autos and check the antecedents of the auto driver. We have also conducted awareness programmes with school managements and parents on this. Auto drivers too have been sensitized about the MV Act rule and adverse effects of ferrying excess passengers.

Q. Your sincere efforts to maintain law and order are quite appreciable. However, the flow of drugs continues in the city, despite previous crackdowns. How are you going to address this issue and what are the steps being taken by you to control use and supply of drugs in city? In addition, frauds involving foreign nationals has become a menace with many of them playing an important role in supply of drugs too. How do you see this whole scenario and how are you going to make Hyderabad drug-free and fraud-free? — K Pradeep Kumar

A. The drug situation in Hyderabad is not very grave. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards drugs. Cases are immediately booked whenever any information is received about drug trade. During 2019 98 cases were booked and 188 persons arrested including, one foreign national. Our intelligence teams are on constant alert with regard to drug trade. We also maintain close liaison with the excise and drugs department, the narcotics control bureau and other concerned sister agencies. We keep watch on likely hotspots of this crime. A special team in the CCS is dedicated for prevention, investigation and detection of drug related offences. In 2019, all investigating officers in Hyderabad city were given special training for investigation cases under the Narcotics, Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. We also urge public to inform us of areas/persons where this problem occurs.

Q. Medians, on many roads, are posing a risk as they are not clearly visible during night. Only once you get very close, can you see them. The danger of vehicles running into them, therefore, cannot be ruled out. Pasting radium stickers will be the easier solution at no higher costs. — V S Krishnamurty

A. All SHOs of traffic police stations are already fixing radium stickers supplied by traffic stores. Hyderabad Traffic Police also took up this issue with GHMC to avert occurrence of accidents and have a clear view from far while driving. It is a good suggestion and we will have more frequent pasting of stickers.

Q. I am a resident of Methodist Colony. My grievance is with ‘Dial 100’. Over the last one year, whenever I have dialled 100 the operator has asked me which police station my area falls under. In today’s day and age, I am surprised the police does not have appropriate tracking systems. How will people, not aware of such details, register their complaints in that case? — Major Shiva Kiran

A. There has been an agreement with all service providers like Airtel, Reliance, BSNL, etc and the process of identifying the exact location based on Latitude-Longitude will be fully functional shortly. This will hold fine-tune, large response mechanism and by February 1, I expect the system to be replaced. Thereafter, citizens will be offered better services.

Q. I am a senior citizen living in Hyderabad since 2008. I have been observing for 12 years that RTC drivers are extremely erratic with their driving and park in the middle of the road to drop and pick up passengers. This causes lot of problems and could lead to accidents. – CP Pujari

A. The Hyderabad traffic police has informed officials of TSRTC about this. Police officers regularly visit all bus depots and conduct traffic awareness programmes to sensitize drivers about follow of traffic rules. The police also regularly enforce MV Act and rules if TSRTC drivers indulge in any traffic violation.

I suggest they counsel and educate drivers at first and then penalise them and lock them up if they continue to err. — Man Mohan Varma

A. Hyderabad traffic police is taking all measures to control wrong side driving and signal-jumping. They regularly conduct special drives against these violations.

Q. Hawkers and vendors have been springing up all over the city’s footpaths, along busy roads and junctions. I have often seen that policemen manning these areas collect bribe from them every day and let them flout the norms. I request you to look into this and set this right. — Challa Vijay Reddy

A. Hyderabad Traffic police is regularly conducting enforcement drives against the footpath and carriage way encroachments. The crane staff are deployed specially for removal of footpath encroachments and removal of illegally parked vehicles on carriage ways. Clear instructions are issued to all the Inspectors to keep a watch on the activities of crane staff in peak hours of traffic.

Q. My question is regarding the appropriateness of public announcements through loud speakers, at traffic signals and the role of senior traffic personnel in managing traffic. The announcements are mostly about paying of challans, how easily one can pay challans and verify his pending challans etc. But it is irritating. Why don't you make these announcements more purposeful like educating the public regarding traffic rules? — Venugopal

A. The public-address system has been installed at important junctions to educate the public about traffic rules and safety at traffic signals. The announcements are played randomly about traffic awareness and also for paying of pending challan and not to violate traffic rules for their safety and family. Hyderabad Traffic Police will take action to announce more road safety tips through public address system.

Q. The police have specified several traffic rules to improve traffic safety, but when it comes to implementation it is far from satisfactory. Whether it is triple driving, helmet-less riding, using mobile while driving, wrong side driving, using loud horns, improper parking etc the menace still continues. Though there is some enforcement it is not satisfactory. For example, all autos should as per law have a window on the rear, but I don 't find any auto following this rule. Are the police unaware of this rule? Though our state is better than many others as far as traffic control is concerned there should be no place for complacence. — S Raghavan

A. All measures are being taken by enforcement of MV Act and rules. Through educating the citizens, taking up re-engineering measures and strict enforcement, the count of fatal road accidents has reduced from 406 in 2016 to 271 in 2019. All officers of Hyderabad traffic police are working hard to ensure safety and security of citizens and ensure smooth flow of traffic in the city.

Q. While the police have been talking about controlling noise pollution, it continues to be a serious problem in our area, Talagadda.

Representative image

MARGAO: Several stations along the Goa stretch of South Western Railway (SWR) will be redeveloped to have more platforms and new station buildings, a top official said on Monday.

Rail Vijas Nigam Ltd (RVNL) general manager Shashibhushan Sahoo told TOI that while most stations along the Collem to Vasco route have just one platform, the expansion of the track will entail the addition of two or more platforms.

The Collem railway station, for instance, will have three platforms, and the construction of a new station building is already under way. An additional platform will be constructed at Kalay, which currently has a single platform. While the Sanvordem station will have three platforms, the redevelopment of the station building and construction of staff quarters is also in progress. The Sao Jose de Areal railway station, which is designated as a halt — it currently has minimal passenger amenities — will now have a passenger hall and two platforms.

The RVNL is also considering redeveloping the Chandor railway station taking into consideration the historic importance of the place, sources said. The single-platform railway station will also have an additional platform.

SWR has set March 2021 as the tentative target to make the Margao-Sanvordem double-tracked route operational. The trial run of the route will be conducted by March this year. Nearly 80% of the double tracking work on the Margao-Sanvordem stretch is complete, sources said. SWR planned to complete the Sanvordem-Kalay stretch by June-December 2021.

The ministry of railways has already notified the Hospet-Hubli-Tinaigat-Vasco doubling project in Goa as the “special railway project” to enable Indian Railways to acquire land under the Railways Act 1989 in areas where the state government has failed to do so as required for the project. The ministry of railways has also notified road overbridge projects at Xelvon, Nessai and Cansaulim as “special railway projects”.

KOLKATA: All religions will come forward under the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church to raise the anti-NRC/CNN pitch on Republic Day .The United Interfaith Foundation India, which has representatives of all faiths, met at the Archbishop House over the weekend and decided that this Republic Day is special because this is the first time that the Constitution has been “challenged” and it’s time to stand by the ideals that form its essence.At the meeting, which was chaired by Archbishop Thomas D’Souza, it was resolved that a human chain spanning the south and north of the city would be formed as a symbol of unity and solidarity against the Centre’s “divisive act”. A meeting has been convened by the archbishop on Wednesday to finalize the logistics.“Starting from Jadavpur University to the Netaji statue at Shyambazar, a human chain will be formed on one side of the road from noon for 15 minutes, according to initial plans. We are approaching all the organisations that have already walked or spoken against the NRC/CAA. The chain would be symbolic of the solidarity the citizens of the city have towards protection of the Constitution,” said Satnam Ahluwalia, general secretary of the Foundation. The police will be approached for help.Appeals will be made to everyone to come out to the streets and hold hands to form the chain, the organisers said. Though the route is yet to receive the approval from the city police, as things stands now, the route will start from JU and keep moving straight till Park Circus.

BHOPAL: A crime branch team raided a bungalow located in the posh Indra Vihar Colony on Airport Road in Koh-e-Fiza in wee hours of Tuesday and busted an organised sex racket that was being operated in the area. The racket is connected to Delhi-based handlers, which supplies high profile escorts, including foreign women, across India. The local handlers called the prostitutes from Delhi on demand from their clients.Police arrested four escort service girls, including an Uzbek and two Nepalese nationals, along with one girl from West Bengal and a pimp, who operated the racket. Police team also nabbed a 38-year-old bank manager, posted at a nationalised bank in Satna, in a compromising position with the sex workers from the spot.This is the second such racket busted in the city in recent times. In August 2019, crime branch busted a similar racket that was also operated in Koh-e-Fiza and nabbed three escort service girls, including two Uzbek and a Nepalese national, along with a pimp and two customers.ASP (crime branch) Nishchal Jharia said that acting on a tip-off about a sex racket being operated at C-106, Indra Vihar Colony, cops sent a constable, who posed as customer and finalised a deal with the racket operator. After getting his signal, a team raided the house and nabbed racket operator Sajid Hussain, (27), who hails from Chadhipura village in South 24 Parganas of West Bengal.Police also nabbed one Uzbek woman, two Nepalese women, and Sajid’s wife, who was also involved in prostitution along with bank manager Ram Kishore Meena, a resident of Nishant Vihar Colony in Satna.ASP Jharia said that the 31-year-old Uzbek woman had come to India on a tourist visa and was staying at Malviya Nagar in Delhi. A Delhi-based handler identified as Ajay was booking her clients. He had sent her to Bhopal on a package of Rs1.5 lakh on Sajid’s demand. She charges Rs10,000 per client and Rs 25,000 for the night. The rates of Nepalese women were less in comparison. The Delhi-based network is well entrenched and the women were provided with forged Indian identity cards so that they do not find any difficulties while checking into hotels.ASP Jharia said that Sajid had paid the flight tickets for the Uzbek woman from Delhi to Bhopal and had a contract to provide for her luxurious stay till the agreement period.ASP Jharia said that Sajid told police that two years back he worked in Mumbai, where he came in contact with a local youth and came to Bhopal and got involved in the sex trade. Around 10 days back, he had rented the bungalow on a rent of Rs11,000 from owner M S Khan through a middleman identified as Amit. There were separate fully-furnished rooms for all the women escorts in the bungalow with luxurious facilities.ASP Jharia said that Sajid’s wife was also into prostitution and he supplied her to clients.Police added that Sajid drives a luxury sedan on which he dropped the escorts to their client’s place. He revealed that he picked up the nabbed bank manager Meena from MP Nagar and brought him to the bungalow.ASP Jharia said that cops have seized the smartphones of the accused and were investigating details about the Delhi-based organised racket, which supplies foreign escorts across the country.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73509565,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-730286,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/another-sex-racket-busted-in-koh-e-fiza-delhi-link-suspected/articleshow/73499734.cms
431,['22/01/2020'],Convocation: CU treads with caution,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Kolkata: Calcutta University has sent out invites to the chancellor and the chief minister for the convocation on January 28, putting behind the recent past when empty chairs greeted the chancellor during his visit to the varsity. But the names of the chancellor and the CM aren’t there as guests in the invitation card as CU is yet to get confirmation either from Raj Bhavan or Nabanna.

CU teachers and students are hoping that the event will pass peacefully without a repeat of what had happened in Jadavpur University.

Sources said that formal invites to the chancellor and the CM had reached their offices and no one had declined receiving the invitation or had conveyed their inability to attend the convocation till Tuesday evening. Nabanna sources confirmed that the CM is likely to attend the convocation as the chief guest unless there are any last-minute changes to her schedule. “The invitation has been received. Over the past few years, the CM has attended the occasion and delivered a speech. Hence, she will attend the convocation this year as well,” the source said.

There has been no communication from Raj Bhavan as well. CU officials expect Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who is the CU chancellor, at the convocation despite the protests in JU that prevented him from reaching the podium even after arriving at the campus. Some CU Senate members are keeping their fingers crossed because Dhankhar didn’t attend the Senate meeting on December 24.

The uncertainty over the presence of the chancellor and the CM has prompted CU authorities to tread with caution. They have sent out invites to Nobel Laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee and other guests without making a mention of Dhankhar and Banerjee in the invitation card. “I have not received any confirmation from any quarter. Hence, the invitation didn’t mention the names of our esteemed guests,” said CU VC Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee.

“Also, the invite doesn’t mention the convocation schedule, which is a norm for other varsities. The event will begin from 1pm,” a source said. According to a higher education department official, the university doesn’t want to land in a controversy over the convocation.

Indrani Bhowmik in front of the DM’s office

KOLKATA: A dog lover who looks after 12 streetdogs in her Nawpara house in Barasat has submitted an appeal to the district magistrate, expressing her desire to take her life “in the face of torture by neighbours”.

Indrani Bhowmik (45) has alleged that her neighbours have been torturing by pouring water on her and her dogs. “Whenever I see water being poured on my dogs, I rush to rescue them. Neighbours then pour water on me as well,” alleged Indrani, an ICDS worker.

The situation took a turn for the worse on January 7 after one of the dogs bit a child in the neighbourhood. A group of 20-50 locals thronged her house and made sure she paid Rs 4,000 for the child’s treatment. “I even complained to police but they did not take any action. My neighbours gave me an ultimatum to drive the dogs out by January 31. They threatened that if I do not yield, they will drive me out of my house. I have submitted a written statement to the North 24 Parganas DM, expressing my desire to exercise my right to die,” said Bhowmik.

DM North 24 Parganas Chaitali Chakraborty told TOI: “I am yet to go through the appeal. It is better that she seeks police help once again. Why should she take her life?” Barasat Municipality vice-chairman Ashani Mukherjee condemned the alleged torture, saying: “We will provide legal assistance to her.”

A neighbour said, “Panic gripped locals after one of her dogs bit a child. Barking by the dogs also affects the health of elderly people.”

KOLKATA: The city airport registered the highest-ever growth in international traffic in 2019, riding a record addition in international flights from the city by Indian carriers keen to spread their wings. The growth in domestic traffic movement was, however, modest.A day after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) released statistics on nationwide air traffic that reflected the twin impacts of a subdued economy and Jet Airways’ grounding, Kolkata airport reported a 13% surge in international passengers during the year. While 27 lakh international passengers travelled through Kolkata airport in 2018, the count increased to nearly 31 lakh in 2019.The rate of growth of domestic passengers was, however, much lower at 4% with traffic up from from 1.9 crore to just shy of the 2-crore mark.According to airport officials, the growth in international passengers was driven primarily by addition of overseas flights in 2019. The number of international flights jumped from 22,423 to 24,579, a 10% rise. A bulk of the new fights was added by IndiGo that extended routes to Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Kathmandu and Yangon.Bankruptcy of Jet Airways in April 2019 that led to the grounding of its flights dealt a blow to the industry. But the impact on Kolkata was much less than that on other major airports as the airline did not operate any international flight and only a handful domestic ones from Kolkata, when it went out of business.In fact, the airport clocked 7,159 more domestic flight movements in 2019 than the year before, an increase of 4.5%. In all, domestic flight movements went up from 1.6 lakh to 1.7 lakh.Overall, Kolkata airporthandled 2.3 crore passengers in 2019, up from 2.2 crore flyers in 2018. Flight movements went up from 1.8 lakh to 1.9 lakh.“We have been experiencing double-digit growth for the past few years but the turbulence caused by multiple factors led to Kolkata airport recording 4% passenger growth against the projected 8%. However, 2020 should be a better year with growth back on track,” said Kolkata airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee.In the 2018-19 financial year, passenger traffic at the airport had grown by 10% to hit nearly 2.2 crore, 20 lakh more than that in 2017-18. But the growth slowed down from 26% in 2017-18 to 10% in 2018-19 as Jet Airways pulled out flights through the year, impacting numbers. This was the lowest growth in the last three years. When the figures for 2019-2020 emerge, growth is likely to be lower still. The airport had recorded a growth of 24% in 2016-17 and 14% in 2015-16.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73513088,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-232695,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-goes-global-airport-logs-13-rise-in-intl-flyers/articleshow/73499780.cms

Prakash Kapadia, president of Jagega Gujarat Sangharsh Samiti , said that the appeals are taking years for the taxpayers and thus they requested the I-T officials to consider provisions of Section 264 that empowers the assessment officers to revise an order. “We told the officials that the hounding by the officers is akin to harassment and ‘tax terrorism’ and if our demands are not met, we would be carrying out a rally of taxpayers in February,” he said.

The representation also attached annexture of 175 pages, outlining major cases seeking review from the department. Earlier this month, an association of jewellers had already raised concerns over alleged harassment by the I-T department in the city.

JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh along with other students. (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union ( JNUSU ) approached Delhi high court on Tuesday, challenging the administration’s decision to amend the hostel manual on the grounds that it is “arbitrary, illegal and adversely affects the student community.”

The petition, likely to come up for hearing on Wednesday, assails the Inter Hostel Administration’s move to amend the hostel manual (that allows for fee hike) and urges the court to restrain the JNU administration from imposing late fee on students for registration for the winter semester 2020.

Filed by JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh and other office bearers, the petition challenges minutes of the IHA meeting issued on October 28 last year and jurisdiction of the high level committee constituted on November 24 that made the subsequent recommendations.

It argues that “amendments to the hostel manual include an increase in hostel fee, affect rights of those in reserved categories vis-a-vis allocation of hostel rooms and also reduce the representation of the JNUSU in the IHA amongst several other changes.”

The petition wants the court to quash the amendments, pointing out “that the minutes of the IHA meeting also stated that mess services, sanitation services, room charges, amongst others category of charges will be increased by 10% every academic year, i.e., from the monsoon semester.”

The rent for all students, including those in the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category with junior research fellowship, senior research fellowship and other equivalent scholarships or fellowships, for single and double-seater rooms has been hiked to Rs 600 and Rs 300 per month, while for BPL students for double and single-seater rooms has been increased to Rs 150 and Rs 300 per month, the plea informs the court.

Earlier there was no utility and service charge but now the university will charge BPL students Rs 500 and other students Rs 1,000 for the same.

The petition in the high court has also challenged the minutes of IHA meeting, which states that mess services sanitation services, room charges, amongst others category of charges will be increased by 10% every academic year. Contending that hike in the hostel fees would direct impact the future of students, the plea sought directions restraining the varsity from taking any actions which would give effect to the draft hostel manual.

The executive council of JNU showed total “non-application of mind” while treating Below Poverty Line students, the plea said.

Keri/Valpoi: Little over two weeks after the carcass of a tiger was found inside the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary at Golauli village in Sattari’s Dongurli-Thane panchayat, the forest department on Tuesday recovered all 14 of the animal’s missing nails from the village’s Kelbai temple.

The investigation team of the wildlife division of the forest department was led by investigation officer Nandkumar Parab.

“We got information from reliable sources that the tiger claws were in Golauli and accordingly we came up with a strategy. This morning, the Sateri-Kelbai temple priest found the claws wrapped in a plastic bag in the sanctum sanctorum. We took possession of them after conducting the panchanama. We are investigating the matter in depth,” Parab told TOI.

On the request of the investigating team, Valpoi PI Shivram Vaingankar pressed a sniffer dog into service, which led the team to a freshly dug pit in a cashew plantation in the village. Officials are investigating whether the nails had been buried there before being shifted to the temple.

Parab said that an unidentified person placed the nails in the temple during the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday.

“I was in Golauli along with my team for the past two to three days. As part of the investigation we had summoned a few suspects from the village,” Parab said.

Tiger nails are highly priced in national and international markets, and given that they were found missing from the carcasses of the tiger found on January 5, it had raised speculation about possible poaching happening in the area and raised questions about the safety of the big cats.

438,['22/01/2020'],Congress state governments may not cooperate on NPR,"NEW DELHI: Congress is likely to opt for “non-cooperation” over the National Population Register ( NPR ) exercise in states where the party is in office, a stance which suggests that the party’s governments may not facilitate the surveys that need to be conducted.With Kerala having declared that it will not undertake NPR , which is to start in April, all eyes are on what other opposition parties will do. So far, Congress has opposed NPR on the ground that it sees it as a “precursor” to the National Register of Citizens. “We will pursue non-cooperation,” a senior Congress functionary said.Since the exercise is to be carried out by state officials, lack of cooperation can fulfil the political objective without the party or states having to veto NPR on record. This will take opposition to NPR beyond party statements and resolutions.However, when asked, Congress spokesman Kapil Sibal said, “The notification was issued for the NPR process to start on April 1, 2020. CAA can only be operationalised if you do a door-to-door enumeration under the NPR, which starts only on April 1. So, today it is not an issue.”He added, “When the Supreme Court decides the matter (CAA) one way or the other, that will be the law of the country, like Ram Janmabhoomi. So once the SC declares the law, that is binding on everybody.”The likely Congress stance on NPR comes after back-to-back red-flagging of the initiative by the opposition. On January 11, the Congress Working Committee brainstormed on CAA-NRC-NPR and demanded that “CAA should be withdrawn and the process of NPR be stopped forthwith”.

KOLKATA: A late-winter temperature fluctuation has activated a spate of viruses in Kolkata, leading to the spread of cough and cold infection, accompanied by fever Children and the elderly have been affected in large numbers. With the mercury unlikely to settle till at least the end of this week, the outbreak may not end soon. It might complicate matters if the dreaded coronavirus , now raging in China and had similar symptoms, reached the city, feared experts.The city’s maximum temperature swayed violently last week, jumping from 22 degrees Celsius to 29 degrees before sliding down to 22 degrees again. It could rise again, predicted the Met office. Such frequent temperature variations help viruses multiply, especially when the mercury slides up. “Most common viruses, like rhino, human meta-pneumo and the influenza virus die out in cold. They start multiplying when the ambient temperature and humidity rises, which is happening now. When the temperature remains low, our immune system and body temperature adapt to the change. If the mercury shoots up suddenly, it fails to adjust to the alteration, making us vulnerable to viral attacks,” said AMRI Hospital consultant Debashish Saha.A traffic sergeant with the Kolkata Police contracted a respiratory tract infection and had to be admitted to a private hospital off EM Bypass this week. According to doctors, he had shed his warm clothes during the afternoon heat last week and consumed chilled water. “But the temperature dropped immediately after that. His system was rendered vulnerable by the temperature change and this is a classic case of a viral attack. There are thousands like him across the city now,” said Fortis Hospital internal medicine consultant Joydeep Ghosh.While rhino virus, human meta-pneumo virus and influenza virus are likely to have struck, it is difficult to identify them unless a test is carried out. But the state doesn’t have the facility. It is the viral fever with severe cough that has doctors worried as it has been striking children more frequently. “A persistent cough has struck scores of children over the last one week. In some cases, it is accompanied by fever. Those with a history of respiratory illnesses, like asthma, have been suffering more than the rest. Children are more vulnerable due to their low immunity and the fact that they are more likely to catch an infection from their school or while travelling by public transport,” said paediatrician Shantanu Ray.The common viruses trigger similar symptoms, which recede in three-five days, according to consultant P K Nemani. “But a bacterial infection can lead to complications and delay recovery. The elderly and children are vulnerable,” said Nemani. Seasonal viruses were highly contagious, so an outbreak was difficult to prevent in winter, said Belle Vue Clinic critical care consultant Samarjit Naskar. “These viruses are transmitted through sneeze and cough droplets, which can travel six feet. So, public places and transport usually help spread them. The only option is to use handkerchiefs and not to touch objects with bare hands,” said Naskar.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73517819,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-88099,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-in-sick-bay-as-temp-swing-spreads-cold-fever/articleshow/73499834.cms

Hyderabad: After a resident from Kalyanpuri, Uppal , aired his complaint about drinking water leakage problem on the TOI Citizen Reporter app, Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) officials swung into action and fixed the leakage.

The complaint was published on January 14, and water board officials began fixing the damaged pipeline the same day. Soon after, residents of Kalyanpuri thanked TOI and the water board for prompt action.

“I did not report about the grievance to any authority. I am aware about the Citizen Reporter app, so I aired my grievance there. I thank TOI and the water board for the prompt response, but a lot of water was wasted,” said Madhu Sudhanan, who reported the grievance.

The leakage happened when new water pipelines were being laid under Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO) project.

Another resident, Rohan Patnaik, from Uppal said that apart from the water wastage, the streets were inundated, which caused a lot of problems for commuters. “The waterlogged road irked commuters and passers-by. Few irresponsible commuters even made their way through the waterlogged streets without even reducing the speed of their vehicles, splashing water on passers-by. Though the issue has been resolved, water got wasted for over 14 hours,” said Rohan Patnaik.

AHMEDABAD: City police on Monday registered a complaint of cheating against two persons for allegedly selling a parking slot at a residential building in Bodakdev to two different people.

In his FIR with Vastrapur police, Virendra Agrawal, a Bodakdev resident and a colour chemicals merchant, said he was given a power of attorney by his maternal aunt, who lives in Mumbai, to manage the affairs of her flat at Goyal Palace in Bodakdev.

Agrawal said that he bought a parking slot, Number 36, on behalf of his aunt from the two accused, Ajay Khemka and Sanjay Khemka, in November 4, 2011 for Rs 25,000 and this was sanctioned by the housing society.

Agrawal later received a legal notice from a woman named Sneha Bhalodia, through her advocate, for allegedly occupying her parking space.

The FIR filed at Vastrapur police states that Ajay and Sanjay had also sold parking slot Number 36 to Mrudula Bhalodia, who sold it to Sneha Bhalodia.

The FIR states that Ajay and Sanjay had cheated him and breached his trust as they sold the same parking slot to another person despite selling it to Agrawal.

Vastrapur police registered an FIR under charges of breach of trust, cheating and abetment against Ajay and Sanjay and began an investigation. Vastrapur police also started taking statements of the housing society residents and scrutiny of the documents to verify if they are genuine.

Panaji: Goa Tourism Development Corporation ( GTDC ) has decided not to allot additional space on the fifth floor of the Paryatan Bhavan at Patto-Panaji to the ministry of Ayush.

Ayush minister Shripad Naik who is also a minister of state for defence, had requested the tourism department to grant additional space on the fifth floor of the building which the department forwarded to GTDC. The minister was allotted a cabin on the ground floor at Paryatan Bhavan when he was made a minister in the central cabinet in 2014. On his re-election in May 2019, besides the Ayush ministry, he was also made minister of state for defence.

A few months ago, Naik requested the tourism department for additional space, since his staff had increased and the existing office was inadequate.

At it’s 164th board meeting, held in November 2019, GTDC decided to decline Naik’s request because it had committed the space on the fifth floor to the immigration bureau and Foreign Regional Registration office (FRRO). It has also planned to build a conference hall to accommodate two hundred people on the top floor, an official said.

The first floor of the building houses the tourism department while the second floor has the GTDC office. Along with the Ayush minister’s office on the first floor, there are offices of India tourism, a tourist center and exhibition halls.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant is also allotted a cabin in the bhavan on the third floor and the GTDC’s project cell is also on the third floor. Former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, during his stint in the defence ministry, was allotted an office at the Paryatan Bhavan where he met officials during his weekend visits to Goa.

444,['22/01/2020'],Justice Haq’s transfer an insult to Nagpur bar: Lawyers,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Nagpur: In a rare show of solidarity, the city’s lawyers on Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution to protest the sudden transfer of Justice Zaka Haq to Aurangabad by Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog without giving any concrete reason.

Terming it as an “insult” to the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) here, over 300 lawyers protested the CJ’s move in a voice vote and decided to send a delegation of top lawyers to Mumbai with a request to get the transfer order cancelled. The District Bar Association (DBA) led by president Kamal Satuja has already extended its support to the HCBA.

The HCBA’s general body meeting at Bar Room No. 1 saw an unprecedented turnout of lawyers who crowded the venue. Many noted lawyers, including senior counsels like Surendra Kumar Mishra, Anil Mardikar, Anand Jaiswal apart from Firdos Mirza, Shreerang Bhandarkar and others made it a point to attend the meeting.

HCBA vice president Purushottam Patil and secretary Prafulla Khubalkar said their executive body will soon take a decision on when to meet the CJ and who will be the members meeting him.

According to the lawyers, the CJ’s move has upset Justice Haq, who’s well known in legal circles as an upright, honest and a dedicated judge. He is reportedly planning to quit.

“We know him since last 35 years and he’s still continuing with his hard work, sincerity and devotion. The transfer order, however, has demoralized him and his zeal to work with the same spirit. He was even talking of putting in his papers. We believe that this is an onslaught on the judiciary’s independence which is directly affecting the justice administration system,” Mohan Sudame, who moved the resolution in the meeting, told TOI.

He was seconded by Uday Dastane, who explained how Justice Haq would be in an inferior position at the Aurangabad bench in comparison to Nagpur. “In the city, he’s currently at the fourth position, but after the retirement of Justice PN Deshmukh on February 11, he will come to the third spot and after November 5, he will occupy the second position after the retirement of senior administrative judge Ravi Deshpande. Here, he will retire as the second senior-most judge as only Justice Sunil Shukre would be ahead of him as an administrative judge,” he told TOI.

He added that in Aurangabad, he would be in the fifth position and retire in May 2021 in the same position. “In the Nagpur bench, he would at least sit on a division bench whereas in Aurangabad, he would be looking after a single bench only. This is a big disrespect to the city’s bar which has a rich tradition of producing legal luminaries, including the Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde, Supreme Court judge Bhushan Gavai and retired SC judge Vikas Sirpurkar.”

Mirza said nobody had the powers to disrespect the city’s bar by making such a move which would demotivate young lawyers, who dream of becoming judges. “The entire judicial system would suffer if good lawyers refuse to become judges due to the treatment meted out to seniors,” said Mirza.

Bhandarkar said the lawyers’ community is deeply hurt because of the manner in which a senior and respected judge from the bar was treated. “He (Haq) has sacrificed his entire life and good legal practice to take up the judge’s post,” said Bhandarkar.

Adil Mirza said Justice Haq was an inspiration for young lawyers as he used to guide them on drafting skills and pleading cases in courts. “He used to sit till 7pm for most of his working days and even on Saturdays,” he said.

The festival scheduled from January 23-26 is a people-supported, independent and volunteer-led initiative that will screen 34 films featuring a wide range of compelling stories from India and south Asia. The opening keynote address will be given by writer Arundhati Roy, who has been vocal about the abrogation of Article 370 and the Citizenship Act.A brainchild of Kasturi Basu and Dwaipayan Banerjee, PFC was formed in 2013 and it has about 40 members now. It doesn’t accept any funds from corporate organisations, NGOs or institutions and runs on donations from individuals, said a member.“While selecting the films, our screening committee had in mind that we are living in a time when the people of the Valley are caged into silence and the communities are being threatened to be stripped of their citizenship, as the two-nation theory rears its ugly head once again amid ghosts of the Partition. It is also a time when demonizing of migrants, crackdown of political dissent, violence against oppressed castes, genders and religious minorities, economic slowdown and capitalist assault on labour rights and public education have become a regular state of affairs in India,” said Banerjee, one of the founding members of PFC. According to him, the festival will also focus on the climate crisis, causing shifting patterns of seasons, affecting the ecology, agriculture and marginalised sections of people.Everyday from 10am to 9pm, several films will be screened at Uttam Mancha. Among the noteworthy films are, ‘Prison Diaries’ based on the imprisonment of women for their resistance to the Emergency of 1975-77, Bangladeshi film ‘Rising Silence’ on the relationships between women, Ashish Pandey’s ‘Nooreh’, set in Kashmir, a film ‘Janani's Juliet ’ by Pankaj Rishi Kumar, Anand Patwardhan’s ‘Reason’, and Laura Kansy and Oskar Zoche’s ‘Strangers’. Apart from the films there will be interactive sessions by Sanjay Kak, Anand Patwardhan and other directors. The festival will end with a poetry, music and conversation by Aamir Aziz and Moushumi Bhowmik titled ‘Singing your despair, and mine’.Both Basu and Banerjee believe that image can be a beautiful and effective medium for conversation.

Nagpur: There is a misconception that standardized Marathi language is used only in Mumbai and Pune. However, study of ancient literature shows Marathi language originated in Vidarbha and therefore it should be given the recognition it deserves, said noted researcher and saint littérateur Madhukar Joshi on Sunday.

He was speaking at the 97th foundation day ceremony of Vidarbha Sahitya Sangh (VSS) held at Sanskrutik Sankul. Seated on the dais were working president of VSS Waman Telang, vice-president Shripad Joshi, secretary Vilas Manekar and Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram.

Joshi said, “Sanskrit poets have praised ancient literature of Vidarbha which had stamped its authority. Poet Watsgulm alias Rajshekhar from Washim was effusive in praise of rich Marathi literature produced by poets in Vidarbha which is sweet like nectar. Even poet Waman of Kashmir had lauded compositions written in Vidarbha way back in the 18th century. His ‘Kamdhenu Tika’ said selection of precise words is real literature which is found in Vidarbha.”

However, time has come to give a serious thought whether literature in Vidarbha has lost its touch or is rare to find now, he added.

A list of 12,000 ancient poets of Vidarbha, who have made standard compositions in 398 forms, is available and there is no need to get those certified from Mumbai and Pune, Joshi said. He lamented that littérateurs from Vidarbha were not given the respect they deserved.

VSS handed over 18 awards to writers and institutions on the occasion.

‘Grace’ award was bagged by Ravindra Ingle. The other awardees included Madhavi Kunte (Shantaram Katha), Virag Pachpore (Deoras Parv), Bhandara branch (best branch) and Vishal Ingole (promising writer). Manjusha Joshi of Maharashtra Times was given Harikisan Agrawal journalism award.

Sunil Yavlikar, Satish Pawde, Vijay Publications, Arvind Vishwanath, Sanjay Arvikar, Bal Padwad, Minal Yeole, Rajendra Dolke, Aboli Vyas, Madan Deshpande, Divakar Mohni and Vidyadhar Bansod received awards for their respective works.

Dolke replied to the felicitation on behalf of the awardees.

The programme started with the lighting of a traditional lamp by the guests. Vice-president of VSS Waman Telang welcomed the guests and also proposed a vote of thanks.

Vrushali Deshpande conducted the proceedings.

Saligao: Local flower vendors in the Mapusa market claim to have received threats to their lives from migrant vendors doing business in the market. These vendors, with support from the Revolutionary Goans, have written to the police inspector of the Mapusa police station in this regard.

In the letter, they said that despite several complaints being filed with the Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC), no remedial action has been taken. They also highlighted the issue of migrant vendors encroaching the footpaths.

The local vendors have also accused one migrant vendor of indulging in constant fights with them and have requested the police to warn the vendor against this.

Meanwhile, Manoj Parab of Revolutionary Goans said that migrant vendors must restrict themselves to the wholesale side of the business. The group has also urged the MMC to resolve the issue within three days. Further, they threatened to protest and shut down the market if the civic body fails to do the needful.

“We demand that MMC initiates stern action against migrant vendors selling their wares outside the market which is effecting the business of the locals . We feel that the migrant vendors may attempt to attack local vendors, hence we have filed a complaint against them doing illegal business,” Parab said.

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday said the term “election” held by the Supreme Court encompasses all steps and stages of an and not just the polling day and declaration of results.

It thus held the requisition made by the Election Commission of India or the State Election Commission for teachers to be roped into poll duty is permissible legally under law.

A bench of Justices S C Dharmadhikari and Riyaz Chagla passed this order in two petitions filed by Maharashtra Rajya Prathamik Shikshask Samiti, an association of primary school teachers, and Shivaji Patil-Rode from Kolhapur. The petitions wanted a stay on requisition of teachers for election duty and argued they cannot be deployed for all duties, right from preparation of electoral rolls. Their counsel, S W Bandiwadekar, expressed apprehension the assistant returning officer “may ruin the careers of teachers” for any “disobedience” but added at best teachers can be deployed on poll day duty.

But, the HC agreed with Pradeep Rajgopal, counsel for the ECI and the state election officer, that the term “duties related to elections” under the law have a wide connotation and include all preparatory stages too.

“A narrow meaning would defeat the purpose of the Representation of Peoples Act.”

The HC said right since 1952 the SC has construed the word ‘election’ widely.

“The Articles of the Constitution and provisions of the Act have been interpreted to hold election means the process from first stage till the end,’’ said the court.

Keri/Valpoi: Incidents of big cats attacking cattle are on the rise in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in Sattari . On Tuesday, a subadult bull was found killed by a leopard in Satre and a subadult buffalo was found killed by a tiger in Surla.

Deputy conservator of forest Vikas Dessai said that panchanama and post mortem study has been carried out on both the carcasses and that while it is confirmed that in Surla it was a tiger that killed the buffalo, it is yet to be determined if was indeed a leopard that killed the bull at Satre. “The subadult buffalo was killed on Monday evening,” Desai told TOI.

Assistant conservator of forests Nandkumar Parab said, “It appears that the bull was killed by a leopard. I visited Satre where the Bamo Shelke families reside and assured them that they would receive compensation. Our officials have been given instructions to patrol and monitor movements of the leopard and tiger.”

THANE/MUMBAI: A group of youngsters and residents replicated the Shaheen Bagh protest in Mumbra , expressing solidarity with nationwide agitations against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and recent attacks on students.

Activist Teesta Setalwad and MLA Abu Azmi who joined the protestors on Tuesday evening said the adverse impact of the Act on backward classes has to be considered while another activist, Fahad Ahmed, criticized it, alleging it was a ploy to create divisions and unrest in the country.

Kapil Agarwal, a TISS student, spoke at the gathering to extend support to protests against attacks on students and the CAA. “Students are unified and we will always raise our voice if our brethren is being attacked or our voice muzzled. The governments should realise that their attempt to muzzle our voices has boomeranged as students from premier institutions like IIM and IITs are joining our movement,” he said.

Meanwhile, at TISS, Jamia students Ayesha Renna and Ladeeda Farzana, who have agitated against the CAA, met students to commemorate Rohith Vemula’s third death anniversary. Renna said, “Rohith is the one who gave me confidence to assert my identity. People are running a hate campaign as I take my identity.”

Addressing students, Farzana said, “Whatever is happening is the initiation of genocide. There is political exclusion and people are being asked to avoid their Muslim identity.” She added the Rohith Vemula movement gave them inspiration to express their identity.

Hebbal police arrested four men for allegedly cheating public with demonetised notes

Bengaluru: Four people who allegedly cheated a cabbie and his cousin by claiming they could get demonetised currency notes sold to people who would deposit them with Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) have been arrested. Banned notes with a face value of Rs 1 crore have been recovered from them.

Rajendra Prasad alias Rajendra, 49, of KR Puram, Suresh Kumar alias Suresh, 40, of Wilson Garden, Shanawas, 45, of Adugodi and Sathish K, 40, of Deepanjalinagar, were arrested after cab driver DM Nagaraju, 52, of Bagalur Cross near Yelahanka filed a complaint against the quartet and alleged they’d cheated him and his cousin.

Preliminary probe revealed Rajendra befriended Nagaraju at an Indira Canteen in Malleswaram in the first week of November 2019. He kept in touch with him and gained his confidence. He told Nagaraju he could help him make money by trading in demonetised currency.

According to Nagaraju, Rajendra told him he knew people in possession of demonetised currency who were ready to sell it at 10% the face value and also those who would buy it at a higher price and exchange it with RBI.

“Rajendra stage-managed a deal where an acquaintance sold Nagaraju banned notes with a face value of Rs 1 lakh for Rs 10,000 and arranged for another man to pick them up for Rs 15,000 the next day. Thinking he could make easy money in this business, Nagaraju came on board,” a police officer said.

Nagaraju contacted his cousin Rajanna SD and the duo decided to invest. They arranged for Rs 5 lakh each and purchased banned notes with Rs 1 crore face value (Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations) on January 16. Rajendra promised to get them sold in three days. The fraudsters met Nagaraju and Rajanna at Hebbal on Monday and collected the notes, saying they would contact them soon. But the quartet didn’t return and their mobiles remained switched off. Nagaraju realised they had been cheated and knocked on the doors of Hebbal police.

A team headed by inspector Ashwatha Gowda J and sub-inspector Rajesh VM swung into action and arrested the four men. “We seized the demonetised currency from the accused. They claim to have collected it from a man in Kerala. We are questioning them about others involved in the fraud,” a police officer said.

456,['22/01/2020'],BA question paper error misses all eyes; spotted by valuer,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Nagpur: A five-mark blunder in Bachelor of Arts (BA-I) exam of Nagpur University (NU) was missed by the moderator students, their teachers, as well as centre officials but spotted and reported to the Nagpur University (NU) by the valuer. Generally, question paper related issues are raised by students or their teachers soon after the exam.

In a role reversal, the valuer lodged a complaint with the director of examinations after she grew suspicious on reading answers for a particular question. This forced her to check the question paper again that revealed that the paper setter had made a mistake in author’s name, spelling it as ‘Rani Seth’ instead of ‘Raaji Seth’.

Yet, no substantial action has been taken by the university officials who said it didn’t receive any complaint from the students. Director Prafulla Sabale said the issue has been referred to an expert committee of dean and subject teacher. “The valuers have been asked to skip the particular question of Hindi Literature answerbooks until a decision is taken,” Sabale said.

Associate Professor Madhulata Vyas, who filed the complaint, said the students are entitled for three marks against the question as the NU had failed to print an error-free question paper.

Vyas got the first bundle of answerbooks for the BA first semester exam. “Many times students have to pay fee again, prepare again, and wait for results. A lot goes away in this,” she said.

Vyas said, “I feel some students got confused while others had no clue yet they attempted it. The confusion was with another story in section ‘Umaas’ where we have a character named Rani. Many developed their answer on this character. But some fictitious answers made me suspicious and I cross-checked the question to find the problem was there,” she said.

Vyas said whether it is printing, paper setter or moderator’s mistake, the ultimate sufferers were students. “This would have been mental harassment for students during exam. It also raises doubt if any proof-reading was done,” she said.

Vyas said already the language is suffering in Maharashtra and such mistakes by a University will hinder its development. “We teachers are trying to facilitate good and easy to understand writing but such mistakes undo our efforts,” she said. In her complaint, Vyas appealed that students shouldn’t be punished for errors of teachers. “University must give average marks to all students,” she said.

Deaf and abled children talking in sign language during a match

Nagpur: The very essence of football was amply and ably demonstrated during the novel DeafKidz Goal! Tournament organized by Slum Soccer recently at their Bokhara Academy in Nagpur.

In a bid to create an inclusive society, 50 deaf students of Deaf School, Shankar Nagar, and 30 (hearing) youngsters from Slum Soccer’s interventional community centres were brought together and divided into 8 teams, each having representation from deaf and hearing boys and girls.

It was a sight to behold as able players and deaf players of the 8 teams interacted with each other in a language that evolved from the yearning to excel as a team. The names decided by the teams for themselves were Barcelona, Real Madrid, Liverpool, Juventus, Dortmund, Inter Milan, Manchester City and Bayern Munich.

Adding to the uniqueness was the composition of the teams as each team consisted of 10 players (6 deaf and 4 hearing). The tournament, which was held in league format, was won by Team Juventus 1-0 by a solitary goal scored by Mandhan Khobe.

Uday Bhoyar, Deaf Association (Deaf Club India) and Meena Sangole, principal of Deaf School, Shankar Nagar, were the guests of honour and gave away the trophies to the winner and runners-up teams. The next deaf tournament for Saoner Deaf School children will commence on February 1 at Slum Soccer Bokhara, Nagpur.

Go and stage your protest at the President’s house,” she told protesters near Bab-e-Syed Gate.

The VC’s wife visited students at the protest site and tried to convince them to end their agitation claiming that her husband did not do anything wilfully and had best intentions in heart.

When contacted, Hameeda said that she went there to tell them that they should move forward. She said, “I told them categorically that the decision was taken with good intentions but the VC was not aware of the consequences. We don’t want them to spoil their future.”

Magsaysay award winner Sandeep Pandey

AGRA: A day after social activist and Magsaysay winner Sandeep Pandey delivered his speech on the AMU campus, Aligarh police booked him on Monday for allegedly using inappropriate language against Hindutva ideologue Veer Savarkar while he was addressing CAA protesters on Sunday.

“Pandey was booked under sections 153 (provocation with intent to cause riots) and 505 (1) (b) (inciting public or community to commit an offence) of IPC at Civil Lines police station on a complaint filed by Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha national vice-president Rajeev Kumar Ashish,” said Civil Lines circle officer Anil Samaniya. The investigation is on, he added.

In his speech on Sunday, Pandey likened BJP to the British, “as both believed in dividing the people and suppressing dissent”. According to the complainant, he used objectionable language against Savarkar, who was associated with Hindu Mahasabha.

Demanding Pandey’s immediate arrest, Rajeev Kumar Ashish threatened to launch a nationwide protest if police failed to discharge their duty.

Addressing students at a protest on AMU campus, Pandey had said that the government is misleading people by blaming students for the violence at Jamia, AMU and JNU whereas as the reality is that ‘masked’ RSS and BJP men are the real culprits behind the clashes.

Pandey said, “The students are protesting against the Act in a disciplined manner, both in Jamia and AMU. They can’t be blamed for the violence.” He added that the violence was sparked either by masked men sent by BJP and RSS or occurred as a fallout of the police atrocities.

The activist was placed under house arrest multiple times and stopped from taking part in peaceful protests but managed to arrive in AMU to address the students.

A Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, Pandey launched a people's group named Asha Parivar in 2008 that focuses on strengthening democracy at the grassroots in Hardoi district of Uttar Pradesh . He was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2002 for the emergent leadership category.

Former Congress vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana said that one after the other new instances of corruption were coming to the fore in Uttarakhand. “Be it NH-74, scholarship scam or other matters, the need of Lokayukta is being felt in the state,” he said, adding, “The name of the son of a senior BJP legislator has also cropped up in a matter and we fail to understand that when the situation is such, why is the BJP swaying from having a Lokayukta in the state. It looks like a deliberate move to safeguard few people.”

Meanwhile, BJP media in-charge Devendra Bhasin called it “frustration” of the Congress. “Be it on the national level or the state level, the name of Congress members is being linked with one matter or the other. Action was required on acts of corruption and the BJP government has been successful in doing so and as a result many people are behind the bars and action is being taken in each and every matter,” he added.

The BJP government has already tabled the Lokayukta Bill in the state assembly but it has been pending for past few years.

464,['22/01/2020'],MahaMetro’s another experiment to solve Sadar flyover landing mess,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Nagpur: With the Sadar flyover’s faulty landing, on the Kamptee Road side near Kasturchand Park, resulting in traffic chaos, MahaMetro has come up with a solution — make all roads surrounding Kasturchand Park one-way.

MahaMetro has submitted its plan to the deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Chinmay Pandit. “There will be no need to block traffic heading towards Kamptee. Even traffic signals need not be installed at the landing area of the flyover. Traffic around Kasturchand Park, if made one-way, can solve the problem,” an official from MahaMetro told Pandit on Tuesday morning.

The official said that the entire Kasturchand Park be treated as a traffic island and explained that vehicular traffic moving towards Kamptee or Sadar will be allowed to move from Samvidhan Square towards LIC Square or the Sadar flyover. “Both sides of the road from Samvidhan Square to LIC Square should be treated as one-way. But vehicular traffic coming towards Samvidhan Square will be diverted from Kingsway (by taking left and then right towards Samvidhan Square),” the official said.

Similarly, traffic towards Ram Jhula will pass via LIC Square. However, Kingsway will remain two-way up to Shrimohini Complex Square from Jaistambh Square.

The proposed detour will increase travel time for motorists, especially those using the new Sadar flyover and going toward Wardha Road. While giving the nod to the new proposal, the traffic cops should also consider that vehicles coming down the Sadar flyover and intending to go towards Wardha Road will be diverted towards Shrimohini Complex via LIC Square by keeping them on the left side of the road, while traffic coming from Samvidhan Square and going toward Gaddigodam and beyond will travel on the extreme right side. It may add to the chaos at LIC Square.

MahaMetro has already submitted a plan to construct a single-lay flyover from the point where Ramjhula ends, passes Jaistambh Square, takes a left turn at Shrimohini Complex Square and ends on the road near Samvidhan Square.

Meanwhile, with a view to overcome the faulty infrastructural development, Nagpur city traffic police on Tuesday diverted vehicular traffic proceeding towards Kamptee Road via Sadar’s Liberty Square and paved the way for vehicles coming from the Sadar flyover to merge directly with the road between LIC Square and Samvidhan Square.

As planned, on Tuesday morning, the Sadar zone traffic police restricted the vehicles coming towards LIC Square from Samvidhan Square to use the Kamptee-Wardha Road. The police barricaded the road to divert the vehicles from beneath the Sadar flyover. The vehicles use the Liberty Square road to move towards Gaddigodam and beyond. The move eased congestion for vehicles coming down the Sadar flyover as they got direct access to merging with Kamptee-Wardha road.

As a result, vehicular traffic beneath the Sadar flyover was found moving at snail’s pace. Even the narrow Mount Road remained jam the entire day as the diverted Kamptee Road traffic used this stretch. As traffic police closed Kamptee Road, many motorists, even four-wheeler drivers, were seen taking a U-turn from the flyover, risking the lives of fellow motorists.

DCP Pandit and senior PI of Sadar zone Atul Sabnis admitted that barricading Kamptee Road near the flyover landing and diverting Kamptee Road traffic from Liberty Square was not a permanent solution. The DCP, however, expected that the MahaMetro proposal can solve the problem. “The decision regarding MahaMetro’s proposal will be taken after discussions with higher-ups,” he said.

466,['22/01/2020'],HC stays order on RGIA tariff plan,"This story is from January 22, 2020

Hyderabad: In an order that is likely to further delay the new tariff plan on the user charges levied by GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited (GHIAL) for 2016-2021 period, the Telangana high court on Tuesday stayed an order of a single judge who referred the issue to an appellate tribunal.

Sources said the authorities were unable to determine the tariff plan even though the bloc period itself is hardly one year away. A tariff order by the central authorities may result in either increase or reduction in the current user charges. GHIAL operates the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport ( RGIA ) at Shamshabad.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy was hearing an appeal filed by GHIAL, which questioned the decision of the single judge. It contended that it filed a petition challenging the proposals to fix a tariff order by the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) for a five-year bloc period from 2016 to 2021. But since that was only a proposal shown on a consultation paper, it cannot be referred to the appellate authority established over and above AERA, GHIAL argued.

The bench observed that the single judge should have said the petition was premature instead of sending it to the appellate tribunal. “Or a writ court can decide the case on merit,” it said. The bench also sought counters from AERA, the civil aviation ministry and appellate tribunal within three weeks.

“If AERA finalises the tariff order, then it can be questioned. A plea questioning such a final order can be referred to the appellate tribunal. What the single judge referred to the tribunal was only a consultation paper which cannot be questioned at this stage,” the bench said.

The single judge committed an error by saying that alternative remedy was available to the petitioner, GHIAL said, contending that remedy could be availed only when a final order was passed. “What we are seeking now is that this court should restrain AERA from going further with its consultation paper to fix a final tariff order regarding fixing charges for aeronautical facilities made available by us,” the company said.

Referring to the contention of AERA counsel that it was empowered by the AERA Act to revise the tariff order every five years and that the appellate authority has powers to review the same, the bench said courts too should act within the mandate of the AERA Act and not beyond that. “The Act does not provide for a review by an appellate authority at the stage of a consultation paper and hence courts cannot act on it,” it added.

Haridwar: To protect some eco-sensitive landscapes of Uttarakhand such as Gangotri and Yamunotri, which are responsible for water security of the nation, the forest department has decided to use drones to navigate through these zones, and protect the entire higher Himalayan habitat.

These zones house some of the most precious and costliest flora and fauna found in anywhere in the world such as keeda jadi and snow leopards.

The state lacks skilled and trained manpower for high-altitude landscapes and the drones would fill the gap. RK Mishra, senior officer of state forest department, said, “We will be using drones in Govind Wildlife Sanctuary as a pilot project and then in Gangotri National Park. We would be running sorties mission at night time on the key pathways as poachers use those paths, when visibility is low.”

Drones would also help track movement of animals such as snow leopards, musk deer, blue sheep and brown and black bears. It will also be used in collecting in-depth data of conservation landscape of the forest department that has medicinal plants and unique plant species in abundance.

Chief Wildlife Warden Rajiv Bhartari said that conserving the flora and fauna from anti-social elements is directly linked to safeguarding the rich bio-diversity of the Himalayas. “It thereby also saves the water system of the Himalayas that nurture the entire country. We are also imparting skill training to the local residents so that they can become a source of information for us and also save their terrain.”

The project will be conducted under project SECURE by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) which aims to save the high-altitude landscape which is home to snow leopards. “For saving snow leopards, we have to save its habitat first and, hence, we cannot afford to let the snow melt,” Mishra added.

The drones would not enter a 25km boundary from international borders as for that it will have to take permission from ministry of defence. Presently, only the Wildlife Institute of India has permission to conduct drone sorties for monitoring flora and fauna near border areas. The hill state also has a Uttarakhand Forest Drone Force (UFDF) under Dr Parag Madhukar Dhakate.

A senior IFS officer, meanwhile, said that using drones in the plains of terai and using it in the high altitude are two extremely different scenarios. “Starting from wind velocity to battery drainage everything is different, and that’s where we are going to check our challenges as we forge to safeguard the Himalayan habitat.”

Nagpur: Soon, pets or domestic animals in the city will also get dignified farewell as humans do.

When pets or domestic animals die, people either wait for the civic authorities to take away the carcass or dump them by the roadside. But now, the city is all set to get its first incinerator to cremate animals.

The Nagpur forest division will set up an incinerator adjoining Transit Treatment Centre (TTC) at Seminary Hills. Financial bids for the Rs16 lakh project were opened on Tuesday.

The forest department will allow the cremation at a nominal cost which will vary for large and small animals. The money thus collected will be used on the treatment centre.

“While treating sick or injured wild animals at the centre, there are mortalities too. Till now, we used to bury the carcass or else their cremation will require wood which in turn will damage the environment,” said Prabhunath Shukla, deputy conservator of forests (DyCF), Nagpur.

Shukla added, “To dig pits for burial, we either engage JCB machines or labourers which proves to be a costly affair. The incinerator, which will be electrically operated, will not only be cost-effective but also prevent environment damage.”

The proposal for an incinerator was first mooted by district honorary wildlife warden Kundan Hate six months ago, but owing to the cost it was turned down. “However, after I convinced that the project can generate money from people who have no proper facility in the city to cremate their pets, the forest officials agreed,” says Hate.

“Secondly, the incinerator was much needed as the forest area in Seminary Hills is already packed with burial of carcasses. When a big animal like bison (Indian gaur) dies, there is space problem while digging a pit,” Hate said.

“The new facility will have a capacity to cremate animals weighing up to 1,000kg. We will also be landscaping the area so that visitors are comfortable,” said Shukla.

Animal rights activist Karishma Galani hailed the forest department move. She said, “Disposing of dead pets and animals is a cause of concern. In a city like Nagpur where number of pets is increasing and several of them die every day, there is no legal facility to cremate them.”

“While those living in independent houses may afford to bury the pets in their backyards, it is much more challenging for apartment dwellers. Quite often, the dead pets end up rotting in a dump yard, canal or in landfills,” said Galani.

“People are very attached to their pets and treat them as a family member. The NMC allows burial of dogs on its land in Bhandewadi but labourers there charge Rs500-1,000 for digging pits. In case of large animals, owners summon local tanners, who remove the skin and dispose of the animals where suitable,” said Galani.

Pits are often laid on nearby areas and forest department relocates them to the designated sites

PANAJI/POINGUINIM: Goa’s modest turtle conservation is picking up momentum despite a delayed start to the season, as a total of nine Olive Ridley turtles visited four nesting sites, opening up an identical number of pits – five in Canacona and four in Pernem.

Morjim and Mandrem in north Goa’s Pernem taluka and Agonda and Galgibaga in south Goa’s Canacona taluka have been designated as turtle nesting sites under coastal regulations zone (CRZ) 2011 notification.

Unlike the mass nesting in thousands on Odisha coast, flippered visitors lay about 50 to 60 nests, on an average at Goa’s four protected sites.

Often pits are laid on nearby beaches and forest department relocates them to the designated sites.

On Thursday, a female turtle arrived at the idyllic Ashvem beach in Mandrem and dug a pit to lay the eggs .

“We have not relocated the eggs and it is being protected in situ. Hence, the number of eggs is not known,” a source said.

On the same day at Morjim — southern end of Pernem coastline, another turtle surfaced and laid some eggs — taking the tally to three nests in Morjim and four at the north Goa sites.

In south Goa, five nests are being protected by forest department at Agonda and Galgibaga.

After a delayed start, Galgibaga played host to the first nesting on January 1.

The first nest in north Goa, at Morjim was reported on January 4.

The number of eggs in the nine pits at the four sites is around 1,000, while the hatchlings emerge after about 55 days of incubation.

During the 2018-19 season, 22 nests had been laid at Morjim and Mandrem, and 1,500-odd hatchlings had been released from about 2,500 eggs.

The Pathri gram sabha passed a resolution in support of the Saibaba temple's development on Tuesday

AURANGABAD: Residents of Pathri in Parbhani district are upset with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for withdrawing his earlier statement referring to their village as Saibaba’s birthplace. They have now sought time to meet the CM.

The CM agreed to drop the reference to Pathri as the saint’s place of birth after a meeting with the residents of Shirdi, who had launched an indefinite bandh over his comments.

The Shirdi residents had, however, called off their bandh after assurances from Thackeray.

The government has sanctioned Rs 100 crore for the development of the Saibaba temple in Pathri. While announcing the plan, Thackeray had referred to the village as the birthplace of Saibaba, triggering a row.

Thackeray, who held a review meeting in Aurangabad on January 9, had stated that an action plan was charted out for the ‘birthplace of Sai’ at Pathri. “I am especially glad to share that an action plan has been charted out during today’s review meeting for the development of Sai birthplace at Pathri and the foundation-laying ceremony of the same will be held shortly. The place will be developed on the line of other pilgrim places in the state,” the CM had said.

On Tuesday, the Pathri gram sabha passed a resolution in support of the Saibaba temple's development in the village.

“The CM has already met the Shirdi residents. He must now listen to our side. We have sought his time to present our side along with all proofs and pieces of evidence,” said Baba Jani Durani, NCP MLC from Pathri. Durani, who is heading the action committee for Pathri development, on Tuesday said the government must form a special committee to verify claims of Pathri being the birthplace of Saibaba. The action committee has also sought an impartial investigation to ascertain the claim that Saibaba was born in Pathri.

“It is known among Saibaba devotees that the saint was born at Pathri. The CM had admitted the same during his visit to Aurangabad, where he announced funds worth Rs 100 crore for development of the temple. Still, in the wake of the latest row, let a government committee establish the facts,” he said.

Sunil Pathrikar, a devotee from Parbhani, said Thackeray should have remained firm on his stand.

“It is unfortunate that the CM has retracted his statement. He should not have compromised on the matter of faith to resolve a deadlock that is purely political in nature,” he said.

Senior lawyer and president of advocacy group Marathwada Janta Vikas Parishad, Pradeep Deshmukh said it was unfortunate that the CM has taken an U-turn on his stand. “The CM is saying that Pathri will be developed on the lines of other pilgrimage places. If such plans are afoot, then he should first explain what religious significance Pathri holds,” he said.

The Sai Baba temple trust at Pathri said the row should not prevent the government from releasing the funds. “The CM has promised the development of the Saibaba temple here. We appeal to the government that the necessary work should not get stalled in the wake of the row,” temple trustee Sanjay Bhusari said.

Saibaba birthplace row uncalled for; CM can't be blamed: Saamna

The Shiv Sena on Tuesday said the chief minister should not be blamed for the “uncalled for” controversy over the Saibaba’s birthplace as nobody can tell whether the 19th-century saint was actually born in Shirdi. Noting that the Saibaba Sansthan’s assets are worth over Rs 2,600 crore, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said Shirdi became “rich” because of the saint, and nobody can snatch away the riches of the town where he died. It also said that Thackeray did not refer to Pathri in Parbhani district as Saibaba's birthplace “on his own”, but on the basis of some historians’ versions.

“The chief minister did not stoke any controversy. Pathri and Shirdikars too should not create one. This will lessen the glow of the saints,” the Shiv Sena said in ‘Saamana’. The “uncalled for” controversy was put to rest after the chief minister promptly paid attention to the matter and cleared the government’s stance on the issue, it said.

The importance of Pune’s Shivneri fort, where Chhatrapati Shivaji was born, did not lessen after the Maratha king died at Raigad Fort, which has now become a “tirth kshetra” (holy place), it added.

AGRA: Following lack of proper monitoring by the regional transport department and the traffic police, at least 10,000 unauthorized “‘jugaad” vehicles are plying on city roads. Jugaad vehicles are basically modified old two-wheelers, tempos or rickshaws fitted with motor engine. These are extensively used for ferrying goods. Besides being a threat to road safety, the jugaad vehicles are causing pollution in the eco-sensitive Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ).The fact that these vehicles continue to ply unhindered on city roads is a cause of concern as the regional transport officials of Agra had cancelled the registration of all the two, three and four wheelers purchased till 1989 on August 30, 2019. These included over 5,000 scooters, loading tempos and vans. However, many were modified as jugaad vehicles but so far, none has been seized by the regional transport department.Regional transport officer (administration) Ashok Kumar Singh said, “The purpose behind cancelling the registration of old vehicles was to ensure that they do not operate. It is illegal to modify old vehicles and use them for loading purposes. We will get these vehicles dismantled.”Superintendent of police (traffic) Prashant Kumar Prasad said, “Soon a campaign will be launched to take action against the unauthorized jugaad vehicles. All these vehicles will be seized. Besides, penalties will be imposed on owners for running these vehicles.”The jugaad is a low cost means of transportation. Therefore, a large number of old scooters-turned-jugaad vehicles are being used for ferrying iron girders, construction material and grocery items. Besides, the diesel-operated jugaad auto-rickshaws are widely used for delivering RO water bottles to households. Vegetable and grocery wholesalers also use these unauthorized vehicles for ferrying goods.According to sources, an old scooter can be turned into a jugaad by spending as little as Rs 10,000. A jugaad auto-rickshaw can be developed for Rs 20,000. With minimum requirement of maintenance, jugaad vehicles easily operate for three to five years.While the judaad vehicles may be cost effective for users, they are not roadworthy. They cause accidents and are known to have poor brake systems. As they move at a slow pace, traffic is held up, resulting in jams on busy roads. In January 2015, a biker had lost his life after his motorcycle had collided with a jugaad rickshaw carrying iron rods near St John’s crossing. While the iron rods had pierced the driver, killing him on the spot, pillion rider succumbed to injuries in hospital.The jugaad vehicles operate on city roads without a registration certificate.

Bijnor: All’s well that ends well – that is what one can say in the case of a couple who were married at the woman uplift centre at the superintendent of police office in Amroha on Tuesday.

The wedding took place after police took upon themselves the task of counselling the couple who seemed to be on the verge of splitting up. The 20-year-old woman in question had filed a police complaint against her 22-year-old beau for refusing to marry her after being in a relationship for two years. The angry woman wanted the man to be booked for alleged sexual assault.

Police counseled the couple and called their families. After hours of counselling, persuaded both to agree to get married. The marriage ceremony was conducted at the station in the presence of policemen and officers.

According to police, the woman approached the Hasanpur police station on January 8 and filed a complaint. The youth was summoned and he admitted that he had promised to marry her but was not yet ready for it.

Police summoned parents of the couple even as the duo was counselled. After a while, the youth agreed to marry the woman.

On being asked about the matter, Ajay Pratap Singh additional superintendent of police, confirmed that the wedding took place. He said, “The wedding took place on Tuesday in the presence of police and parents of the couple. The girl had filed a complaint that she was raped on the promise of marriage.

Panaji: Opposing the anticipatory bail plea of Wilson Godinho , brother of transport minister Mauvin Godinho, in connection with the alleged suicide case of former Merces sarpanch Prakash Naik, the prosecution argued that the deceased had named the accused in a WhatsApp message sent in a group before he shot himself dead. On the other hand, the defence argued that the FIR was filed due to family pressure.

The lawyer, on behalf of Wilson, told the sessions court on Tuesday that there is immense political pressure to have him arrested.

Counsel Rohit Bras De Sa said the FIR was registered only because of family pressure. The case has no connection to his minister brother, he said. The sessions court was hearing arguments in the case.De Sa argued that police couldn’t come to a conclusion if it was murder or suicide. He argued that an FIR shouldn’t have been filed before the inquest report, and added that the postmortem only mentions the medical opinion on injuries suffered.

“Without the inquest report under Section 176, the FIR couldn’t have been registered,” he said. The police jumped the gun because of political pressure, he added.

De Sa submitted Wilson’s call records of the past six months to the court, and added that there was no material to connect him to the victim. Within four hours of the messages circulated by Naik, Wilson went to Old Goa police station but was told by the investigating officer that no FIR was registered, and hence no statement would be required at this stage, De Sa said.

Public prosecutor Poonam Bharne told the court that the deceased clearly stated in his message that he held Wilson and another accused responsible for his death. She stated that mere suspicion at this stage was enough to book Wilson.

Countering De Sa’s contention that there is political pressure against Wilson, Bharne said if the police were acting under pressure as alleged by De Sa, they would have arrested Wilson immediately. She stated that Naik was under tremendous pressure which his family noticed. What transpired between Naik and Wilson and what the deal was needs to be probed, she said.

Traders hold a protest against Agra Municipal Corporation

AGRA: Traders of Sanjay Place market on Tuesday played flute in front of a buffalo to mark their protest against the Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) administration for charging a parking fee at 44 places in the market on Tuesday. Raising slogans against mayor Naveen Jain, traders took out a rally across the market.

Since January 14, traders in Sanjay Place are on an indefinite strike against the AMC. They claimed that it violates norms as they had already paid a fee for parking at the time of purchasing the property.

Vice-president of the Sanjay Place market association Bijendra Baghel said, “The AMC administration is ignoring genuine issues being raised by the traders. Charging parking fee in the market is exploitation of the traders and common people. We will continue our protest against it.”

The dispute over parking fee between traders of Sanjay Place and Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) is sub judice. The traders want AMC to cancel the parking contracts till the court delivers its final orders in the matter.

On Tuesday, leaders of Samajwadi Party, Aam Aadmi Party, Nation Chambers of Industries and Commerce and various other organizations participated in the protest and extended their support to the Sanjay Place market association. Besides, the Congress leaders are in regular touch with the traders.

Secretary of the market association Hiren Agarwal said, “We are not going to tolerate AMC administration’s dictatorship at any cost. Parking mafia will not be allowed to operate in Sanjay Place.”

Association’s treasurer Vinay Mittal alleged that despite the ongoing case at the sessions court, the AMC administration had issued parking contracts for three years to people associated with the BJP. “AMC officials also get a share of the parking fee illegally collected from the market. We will not withdraw our protest till the AMC rolls back its decision,” he said.

Meanwhile, traders alleged that AMC officials trouble them by blocking the sewer line near the dharna point. On Tuesday, traders staged a protest with the main stage in the parking space surrounded by sewer water.

NAGPUR: A fight over an unintentional push while dancing to the music of disc jockey (DJ) led to the murder at a wedding venue at Aman Lawn on Old Kamptee Road on Monday. The victim was of one of the wedding guests. Four people were injured in the fight. The incident triggered so much panic among guests that police are finding it tough to unearth the truth.

The victim, Nikhil Lokhande, 25, was initially dragged away from the venue by his wife Anju as a fight broke out with some persons from bride’s side. Then he got a call from someone at the wedding venue at his Panchasheel Nagar home to return. As Nikhil had not had food, he decided to return with a friend, identified as Ashish, to the venue. He is learnt to have told his wife that he needed to purchase tobacco and would return shortly.

Sources said as soon as he returned to the venue, some people pinned him down and attacked him with sharp weapons. “Nikhil had slapped a person from the bride’s side after there was a confrontation over being getting shoved while dancing. There was a fight but it did not escalate then as his wife and others had compelled him to leave the place,” said the friend. “It seems that the assailants were waiting with sharp weapons for Nikhil to return and zeroed in upon him as soon as he reached the place,” he said.

Nikhil, having sustained stab injuries, was declared dead at Mayo Hospital after being referred from a private hospital where he was first rushed by friends. Four persons — Sonu Shahu, Vicky Dongre, Akash Lokhande and Nikhil Kamble — were injured when they tried to stop the fight. Nikhil worked as a ward boy at a private hospital at Dhantoli. The victim had married around a year ago.

Guests at the wedding started running for shelter seeing armed assailants attacking Nikhil and his friends who tried to save him. Before police could reach, an injured Nikhil was taken away by his friends. It is learnt that medical assistance to Nikhil was delayed as the Kalamna railway crossing gate was closed for a goods train to pass.

Nikhil’s wife Anju and the bride Namrata Kuradkar were friends for which the victim had attended the wedding. Kalamna police have arrested Shubham Soni, his younger brother Manoj and another, identified as Rahul Bhati, for their alleged role in the murder. Sources said the assailants are likely to be closely associated with a gangster from Shanti Nagar.

Panaji: There is no study of the important properties in spice crops in India owing to the lack of analytical equipment , said S D Sawant, vice-chancellor at Dr Balasaheb Sawant Konkan Krishi Vidhyapeeth. He was speaking at the ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute (CCARI), Old Goa, on Tuesday.

“Most of the phenolic compounds, alkaloids, antioxidant properties and fats have not been studied even today. We don’t have such high level analytical machines and other equipment. Such facilities must be made available and we should be doing such research work so that we know better about our spices ,” he said.

Sawant cited the breakthrough finding by the Pune-based ICAR-National Research Centre for Grapes (NRCG) that has developed a variety of grapes which has phenolic compounds and anti-cancerous properties.

“While the grape’s juice has anti-oxidant properties, its seed contains one isomer of vitamin E which is used for cancer treatment. The vitamin E is high compared to other sources of the vitamin. The ICAR-NRCG has standardised how to extract it by isolating the active ingredients,” Sawant said.

Called medica, the grape hybrid can be commercially exploited besides showing great potential in the pharmaceutical industry, he said. “The medica variant of grape juice can be packaged and sold without any preservatives, the skin can be dried and powdered to add in foods, the seed’s oil can be used for its active ingredients,” he added.

Even spices will have many such properties which must be explored, he said. “If we have many varieties of a spice and would like to improve it with breeding, then we must do that on the basis of selection in active ingredients and not just its quantity,” he added.

KOCHI: Mosquito-borne diseases are posing a threat to residents in Ernakulam district and steps need to be taken to control the rising mosquito population. In the past five years, no deaths due to dengue were recorded in the district. But in 2019, the number of dengue cases spiked to 423 from 177 in 2018. While one person died in 2019, no deaths were recorded in 2018.Incidentally, though 494 dengue cases, the highest in nine years, were reported in 2017, no deaths were recorded. This year, so far, two cases of dengue have been confirmed.Chikungunya, another disease transmitted by mosquitoes, which was not reported in 2017 and 2018 in the district, resurfaced in 2019. One case of chikungunya was reported last year. Incidentally, malaria cases were comparatively lower and only 74 cases were reported in 2019. It once again reconfirms the health department’s concern that now there is high density of aedes aegypti, a genus of mosquito, that spreads diseases such as dengue and chikungunya in the district.Dengue fever, which surfaced in Kerala as early as 1998, has now become a serious concern. Till 2015, the disease was more prevalent in districts like Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, Kozhikode and Malappuram. These mosquitoes, which were earlier seen more in rural areas, have now spread to urban areas .“We are taking all possible precautions. But people are still very careless. We found that most of the mosquito-breeding sources are not outside the house but inside,” said Kochi corporation’s standing committee chairperson (health) Pratibha Ansari. She said inside the house, mosquitoes breed in flower pots as well as in water accumulated from AC and fridge.“The popular notion is that mosquitoes breed more in slums, but residential areas are breeding grounds,” said Ansari. On Monday, the corporation council decided to check the possibilities of handing over the job of controlling mosquito population to private agencies.The density of mosquitoes is high in Kochi corporation limits and areas in Thrikkakara, Angamaly and Perumbavoor. In 2019, outbreak of dengue was confirmed in 10 divisions of the corporation.“There has been an increase in mosquito density,” said district medical officer Dr NK Kuttapan.He said though steps have been taken time and again to spray chemicals to destroy the larvae of mosquitoes in areas facing waterlogging, it is the responsibility of the residents to keep their surroundings clean.“We are taking necessary steps to control mosquito density and create awareness among people by launching campaigns. “Next year, we should be able to bring vector-borne diseases under control,” said Dr Kuttapan.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73508581,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-115176,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dengue-cases-up-from-177-to-423-in-19/articleshow/73499926.cms

Times News Network

Mangaluru/Chikkamagaluru: Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy said the Mangaluru bomb incident was a farce and the entire episode of defusing the device seemed like a mock exercise .

He told reporters on Tuesday that it looked like police did a mock exercise usually presented during Independence Day and Republic Day events. He said the bag found at Mangaluru International Airport on Monday contained powder used for manufacture of crackers. “It was not a live bomb,” he said.

After meeting police commissioner PS Harsha at MLC BM Farooq’s house, he said, “He (Harsha) explained about the incident. However, I cannot disclose it all now. He brought to my notice some information. He said he has no role in it. Let’s see what facts come to light.” He lashed out at the government, saying the episode was created to appease some organisations. “There was no live bomb. It was a conspiracy to create a rift between two communities. I haven’t woven stories, but am quoting stories in the media. Reports of 10kg of explosives caused panic,” he said, adding an iron box contained cracker powder and wire pieces and there were no detonators to explode it.

Earlier, Kumaraswamy interacting with media in Sringeri, suspected police involvement in the scare and accused the government of using police to placate a community.

Reacting to the allegations, BJP accused him of doing “appeasement politics”. “He doubted surgical strikes, he released doctored CDs to show peaceful protestors didn't indulge in violence Now he is blaming police for the live bomb defused in Mangaluru. Is there no end to appeasement politics by former CM Kumaraswamy? Why cry for jihadis?’’ the state BJP unit tweeted. Dakshina Kannada BJP district president Sanjeeva Matandoor said Kumaraswamy should undergo narcoanalysis as he has been doubting Mangaluru police.

‘Serious investigation’

PS Harsha said: “I interacted with the ex-chief minister when he landed in Mangaluru... It’s nothing more than a security visit as the ex-CM is also a protectee. We had a brief interaction about the current scenario and I appealed for the cooperation of everyone in maintening law and order. Mangaluru police are investigating the recovered material which was subsequently disposed of and have made progress on leads... This is a very serious investigation and I appeal to all leaders of society to take a responsible stand.
