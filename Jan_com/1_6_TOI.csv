The only record he beats each year is his own. This year, however, is also about imparting knowledge as Pankaj has initiated a connect with schools in Bengaluru where students can learn the nuances of the sport with him.

A professional league, that is televised, will not only attract viewers, but will also provide more visibility to aspiring cueists. The other, is what I can do in my own capacity through my initiative, Cue Schools by Pankaj Advani. Through this, we hope to be able to take the game to schools.

All I can say that there was such a league in place back in 2017, and it was televised. I am not sure what happened to it.

You have to constantly remind yourself, that you are the player who won the last time around, and that you need to be better than that.

A sportsperson’s career goes through loads of ups and downs, it is never smooth. In that sense, I feel I am a constant work in progress. One cannot always be at one’s peak, because there are always other factors in life that change and, therefore, affect the way one performs at a match. It is not easy to maintain the same levels of energy and intensity. I talk to myself constantly, sometimes in front of the mirror and sometimes when I am alone. I remind myself that I have done it in the past, and reinforce the belief that I am still capable of doing it — yet again, any day and anytime. Before playing a major tournament, I tend to get into a shell, I don’t talk much to people. It is even more so when I am travelling. I limit myself to reading on my own during these competitions. My family and closest friends understand my need to be by myself before a tournament and let me be too.The dynamics of team sport is very different when compared to that of individual sport. In an individual sport, you’re completely in charge of your performance. If you win, you take all the credit. If you lose, you take all the blame for the loss. It is good in a way, because you do not have any external factor to blame or comment on. It is just you and your performance in the arena.

6,['6/01/2020'],Nivin Pauly: Being part of films such as Moothon add value to you as an actor,"Last year might not have started out with a bang for Nivin Pauly , but he made sure he ended 2019 on a high – raking in rave reviews for his performance as the tormented Akbar in Moothon and showing that he can still work his magic in the box office with his indolent youth avatar in Love Action Drama . The star talks about the work he put in for his terrific performance in Geetu Mohandas’ Moothon, what its reception means to him and what to look forward to in 2020.I am immensely satisfied with how Moothon has been received. It’s something that I have put in a lot of effort; but ultimately what matters is that audience has to like what I have done and in Moothon that happened. When you are part of commercial cinema, you rarely get such offers to be part of films that get a good run in the festival circuit too and importantly adds so much value to you as an actor. I am just lucky that I could do that in 2019 and I am even more glad that Moothon has been appreciated far and wide.I have never believed in taking pressure. I don’t think you can work well under stress. I pick movies based on my intuition and preference; some movies work, some don’t, and I am fine with that. What matters to me is that I stay happy and try to do good work. Last year, also had Love Action Drama that did well in the box office. People liked its humour and Moothon was entirely different. So, frankly, I consider it a good thing that I could be part of two films that were on two extreme ends of the spectrum.The lessons you learn also vary with the director you work with. Geetu is someone who demands performance from you; she’s not going to let you off the hook so easily. She knows specifically what she wants and gives enough reasoning to exact that out of you. And when a director pushes you, saying that you can do even better, it also spurs you on in a way and gives you that extra bit of confidence as a performer. I think only when you work with such directors, you get to take it up a notch. They make you explore layers that you have never done before. Actors don’t get to do that every time.Many said that there would be different kinds of response when the movie releases, and I had to be ready to face it. But all the feedback has been positive. Majority appreciated me for the brave attempt. Initially too, I had no qualms taking up the role. My only concern was if I could convincingly pull of the character. I think all actors have that fear, irrespective of what character they pick.We were comfortable with each other. He’s a friend too. Both of us were given separate briefings by the director, and these scenes were not rehearsed. We had the freedom to do what we thought made the scene better. Geetu’s only demand was that it had to be spontaneous and to the point. Between co-actors it’s always a process of act and react. Also, almost all the scenes in the movie required spontaneity. We had an acting workshop, but even though we had rehearsed some of the scenes, when it came to performing on the location, we had the freedom to improvise.Of course. It was totally fun and because the subject had a lot of humour, we didn’t have to get into a shell and internalise. We had to enjoy working in the film for it to work. And fortunately, the result was evident in theatres.Amid all the preparations for your characters, did you strike a balance between work and family last year?I like to think I could spend enough time with them. I could plan my breaks so that I could maintain that balance, which I think is important. Also, we spent Christmas and New Year together.I think it will be a mixed bag like 2019. My first release will be Rajeev Ravi’s Thuramukham; it’s a period film set in the 30s and 40s. I am currently shooting for Padavettu. I am also in discussions for a few interesting projects and will be working with a couple of debutant filmmakers.

NEW DELHI: The revenue department has asked the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to go for a more robust check of ""star exporters"" after an investigation found that nine top category trading houses were ""not traceable"" at addresses mentioned by them.Also, 40 out of 241 entities that were scanned declared turnover from of zero to less than Rs 1 crore during 2017-18 and 2018-19, although they were expected to have annual exports of at least $3 million (over Rs 20 crore) to be eligible for the status.""Star"" status entitles exporters to several facilities, including reduced customs inspections. Given the massive amount of frauds detected by GST authorities, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has now written to DGFT to continuously seek a compliance and verification reports from other regulators or mandate exporters to produce statutory records of compliance, including certifications from the banks that they have not been classified as non-performing assets (NPAs) for loan default .The investigation was undertaken after GST authorities initiated a drive to crack down on fraudulent claims of Integrated GST. Exporters have been one of the most vocal critics of the new indirect tax regime with lobby groups, including the Federation of Indian Export Organisations as well as export promotion councils, repeatedly flagging this as a major concern, arguing that a holdup of refunds had increased their operating costs.The issues are expected to be discussed by revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, when he meets officers from state and central GST as well as representatives from the Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Financial Intelligence Unit, later this week to look at new steps to check frauds. On January 2, TOI had reported that the government is looking at new ways to clamp down on GST frauds , including access to bank account details.Tax authorities said widespread irregularities have been noticed during the probe initiated by them. Of the nine ""star"" exporters that were ""not traceable"" at the addresses on record, in two cases the premises were also found sealed and seized by the banks as the exporters had been classified as NPAs.In another case, a garment exporter with over Rs 50 crore turnover took refund of Rs 3.9 crore when the total tax payment in cash was Rs 1,650. Similarly, tax payments in cash were to the tune of Rs 51,201, while the exporter obtained refunds of Rs 9.6 crore. While a part of the tax payment can be made in cash, tax paid on inputs, which are to be set off or refunded, can be used to meet the other tax obligations.Investigators, however, accuse these exporters of using fake invoices and fraudulent tax credits, which have been encashed through the facility of IGST refunds.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73118675,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-33656,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gst-wing-seeks-strict-vigil-on-exporters/articleshow/73113575.cms

10,['6/01/2020'],Patent office rejects Tatas' plea for Swach water purifier,"This story is from January 6, 2020

(File photo)

MUMBAI: Patent wars have intensified in the water purifier market, with biggies Tata Chemicals and Hindustan Unilever ( HUL ) slugging it out in courts.

The Delhi patent office has rejected an application by Tata Chemicals for its water purifier Swach on grounds of it being ""obvious"" and ""lacking in inventive step"". The plea was rejected on January 2, on a pre-grant opposition filed a decade ago by HUL, which owns the Pureit brand.

Over the years, the market has witnessed several such court battles between major players - HUL, Eureka Forbes and Tata Chemicals. In 2012, HUL lost its patent on Pureit, when the Intellectual Property Appellate Board ruled the technology used by it was not new, and was obvious.

Simply put, inventive step means a feature of the invention that involves technical advance over what is known, and not something obvious to a person skilled in that art (field), according to the Patent Act. Legal sources told TOI the Patent Office relied on a previous case where Tata Chemicals had succeeded in getting HUL's patent concerning Pureit, revoked in 2012.

Tata Chemicals and Tata Consultancy had filed the patent application in July 2008 through Obhan & Associates, while the HUL side was represented by Subhatosh Majumdar of S Majumdar & Co. According to the Tata group, ""The design of the claimed device is such that filtration medium doesn't get impacted because in villages it may be used in a different way, and uneven force and pressure may be applied to the filter so it is designed in such a manner that it is able to sustain for a long time.""

A Tata Chemicals spokesperson said: ""We are reviewing the order. Decision to appeal will be taken post review.""

11,['6/01/2020'],Coffee Day promoters' stake dives to 17% from 54%,"This story is from January 6, 2020

(File photo)

BENGALURU: The shareholding of Coffee Day Enterprises’ (CDEL) promoter group has come down sharply from 54% in July last year to 17% as lenders have invoked pledged shares, a filing with the BSE late last week shows.

IDBI has invoked and transferred pledged shares at regular intervals from July last year. Yes Bank has also invoked shares. The shares were invoked from the accounts of promoter V G Siddhartha, and the promoter group, including Siddhartha's wife Malavika Hegde, Coffee Day Consolidations, Devadarshini Info, Gonibenu Coffee Estates and Sivan Securities.

The filing with the BSE showed that an additional 12.6% of the shares are encumbered with lenders, leaving the promoter group with only 5.1% of shareholding that’s unencumbered.

Coffee Day Enterprises' share price has plummeted since Siddhartha's suicide in July. The price was around Rs 200 then. On Friday, it closed at Rs 39.4 on the BSE.

The company’s net debt as on March 31, 2019, stood at Rs 4,796 crore.

CDEL chairman Ranganath, at the recent AGM, said the company was making steady progress in reducing debt by monetising non-core assets and exploring the sale of some group companies.

The board and management also placed before the shareholders major plans to improve the financial fortunes of the company. CDEL has sold its technology park, Global Village, in Bengaluru. Blackstone and southern developer Salarpuria Sattva bought it for Rs 2,700 crore.

A major part of the sale proceeds would be used to bring down debt, the board told shareholders. Global Village is a 4 million sqft tenanted space located on a 120-acre campus.

After Siddhartha sold 21% stake in Mindtree to L&T for Rs 3,200 crore in May, the proceeds net of expenses and tax to the tune of Rs 2,100 crore has been utilised to pare debt.

TOI has reported previously that global private equity majors KKR, TPG Capital and Bain Capital are among investors who have signed a non-disclosure agreement to evaluate a potential share purchase in CDEL's flagship venture Cafe Coffee Day.

Goa have now moved to second in the table with 24 points. They defeated Sikkim, Meghalaya and Manipur, and drew against Bihar. Goa will travel to Puducherry to play the table toppers on January 11. Puducherry are on top with 27 points.

Four wickets down and trailing by 426 runs, Manipur failed to build any partnership. Verma opted for spin and it was the captain who took the first wicket, getting rid of Jayanta Sagatpam LBW on 6. Ajay Lamabam (4) returned to the pavilion after getting caught plumb in front of left-arm orthodox spinner Amulya Pandrekar.

Manipur were reduced to 6-30 and it got worse when they lost the seventh wicket of Karam Dharmendra (0) bowled off Verma.

It looked like the match won't even last an hour. However, allrounder Rex Rajkumar and Kangabam Singh put up some resistance. Rex (21) was harsh on spinners and Goa were happy to let him play attacking shots. He hit four boundaries before trying to cut left arm-orthodox Darshan Misal , edging to wicketkeeper Smit Patel.

Knowing newcomer Thomas Moirangthem would play defensive strokes, Darshan darted in a straight one. The umpire immediately raised his finger the moment the ball hit the pad to send him back to the pavilion.

Darshan took three wickets for 13 runs. Last-man Bishworjit Singh, known for his only-attack attitude, survived the hat-trick ball and another one.

Meanwhile, Kangabam lost his concentration and went for a wild swing off Verma, only top-edging to Vijesh Prabhudessai to mark the end of the match.

Brief scores: Manipur 106 & 88 in 42.4 overs (Amit Verma 6-57) lost to Goa 553-5 decl in 130.3 overs (Sumiran Amonkar 115, Smit Patel 100*, Amit 89, Vaibhav Govekar 88; Rex Rajkumar 2-78).",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-steamroll-manipur-earn-bonus-point/articleshow/73113479.cms
13,['6/01/2020'],Pakistan News: 'Won't allow Pak soil to be used against anyone': Pakistan Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Major General Asif Ghafoor, director of Pakistan's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Sunday told his counterparts from several Muslim countries, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, that Islamabad will not allow its soil to be used for any regional conflict, amidst raging tensions between Tehran and Washington after the killing of top Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in an American drone strike in Iraq.

Soleimani, 62, the head of Iran's elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed in a US drone strike in Baghdad on Friday, sparking fears of a new war in the Middle East.

The Pakistan Foreign Office said that Qureshi held telephonic conversations with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE and Turkey to discuss the regional situation unfolding in the region.

""The Foreign Minister reaffirmed that Pakistan would neither let its soil be used against any other State nor become part of any regional conflict,"" the Foreign Office (FO) said.

Highlighting Pakistan's deep concern over the recent developments, Qureshi underscored the imperative of avoiding conflict, exercise of maximum restraint, and de-escalation of tensions.

He called on all parties concerned to abide by the UN Charter and principles of international law to settle differences through peaceful means.

Sharing Pakistan's perspective, the foreign minister expressed hope that the progress made in the Afghan peace process would be preserved and advanced further.

He reiterated Pakistan's readiness to continue to play a role in preventing further escalation and maintaining regional peace and stability, the FO said.

Hundreds of protesters, including women and children, rallied in Karachi and Islamabad to protest the killing of Soleimani.

The rallies organised by Shiite groups - including Imamia Students Organisation (ISO), Jaafria Alliance, Majlis-Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM), Tanzeem Azadari and Shia Ulema Council - chanted anti-American slogans.

The protestor, carrying portraits of Soleimani and chanting slogans like ""Down with USA!"", were stopped by police from moving toward the US consulate.

The protest rally in Islamabad started from the National Press Club and ended at the D-Chowk in front of Parliament. It was led by Shiite leader Allama Syed Ali Rizvi and women and children took part in the protest.

Pakistan has the biggest Shiite population after Iran and may face turbulence in case of a war between the US and Iran.

The country, in the past, has tried to maintain a balance between Saudi Arabia and Iran which are regional rivals.

The US Embassy in Islamabad already on Friday issued a countrywide security alert, warning its employees and US citizens to restrict their movement.

""Given possible reactions to recent events in Iraq, the US Embassy has restricted travel by US government employees. US government personnel in Pakistan are required to postpone non-essential official movements and most personal movements. US citizens in Pakistan should monitor their surroundings for possible demonstrations and suspicious activity,"" the embassy said in a statement.

15,['6/01/2020'],"Om Raut: While making a historical, you have to maintain the sanctity of the characters","Director Om Raut , who made his directorial debut with the Marathi film Lokmanya: Ek Yugpurush (2015), is all set to step into Bollywood with Tanhaji : The Unsung Warrior. The filmmaker, who has produced films like City Of Gold (2010), Haunted 3D (2011), spoke to BT about working with Ajay Devgn in the magnum opus and making a film that’s mounted on a huge canvas. Excerpts:In 2007, when I was studying in the US, I saw Zack Snyder’s 300 (2007). I was completely mesmerised by it. Until that day, I didn’t know who Leonidas (King of Sparta, played by Gerard Butler) was. When I stepped out of the theatre, I wondered why we don’t make such films. We have so many interesting historical characters and their stories deserve to be told. The first personality that came to my mind was Subedar Tanhaji Malusare.I wanted to make Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior before my first directorial, but I couldn’t get Ajay Devgn at that point of time. I was sure that I wanted to make this film with him. So, after my first Marathi film, I began working on it. That year, Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) released and it gave me the confidence that we, too, can make films on such a huge scale.When I met him, I just had 30 minutes to narrate the idea. After hearing the first half of the story, he asked me, ‘How will you be able to make this film?’ I didn’t quite understand his question. He explained, ‘Who is going to pay for it?’ I was clueless. That’s when he said that he would produce it. That was great news for me. I offered to narrate the other half, but he didn’t even go through the second half that day, which showed his confidence in me. He was convinced on hearing just the first half of the script.Working with Ajay Devgn was very easy. I believe that our styles are very similar. I couldn’t have thought of Saif as Udaybhan Rathod. I approached every actor other than him. Interestingly, not a single actor said no to the role, but I would develop cold feet and then back out from finalising them. One day, Ajay called me and asked me where the villain was. We were fast approaching the time when we would have to start shooting for the film. It was during the meeting with him that we discussed Saif. Ajay contacted Saif, and two hours later, I was in Saif’s office, and soon enough, he was on board. As for Kajol, when I was thinking of casting for the role of Savitribai (Tanhaji’s wife), she did come to my mind. I asked Ajay about it, and he said, ‘Tu Kajol ko bolke dekh phir dekhte hai kya hota hai.’ It is a small role but has a lot of depth.I wrote the character much before I had seen Padmaavat. I believe that there could be parallels drawn, but I don’t think there are any similarities between the two. What Ranveer and Sanjay sir (Sanjay Leela Bhansali) had done in Padmaavat is different. In fact, Udaybhan is louder.The reference of a ghorpad came from a powada (ballad) written in 1839, by an unknown author. This incident happened in 1670, while 1830 is the backdrop of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. At that time, artistes were creating awareness about the freedom struggle. I think that Indians believe in animism. According to me, that is where the domesticated monitor lizard comes in. However, we did take some cinematic liberties in the film, in order to satisfy both the sides. This is a historical film, and someone or the other will react or oppose it. As far as the research is concerned, we read various books and referred to other material that was available to us. However, for inferences like these, you have to create, derive, get inspired and bend the narrative in other ways. While making a historical, you have to make sure that you do not tarnish or distort anything. You have to maintain the sanctity of the characters.I am done with the historical genre for now. No more shooting with swords and shields for me (laughs!). My next Hindi film is of a different genre. I will start working on it soon.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73109347,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-56803/73109347.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/om-raut-while-making-a-historical-you-have-to-maintain-the-sanctity-of-the-characters/articleshow/73109323.cms

The actress, who is currently busy doing theatre, was recently in the city to perform in her latest show, 'Tera Kya Hoga Walia', talks about why she would love to play a healthy naagin on TV, her relationship with her beau DJ Percy , and more.Delnaaz, who has been doing theatre for over a year, now wants to make a comeback on TV. “I am looking for a show worth my while. I feel as an actor, I have not got my due in the industry. I have done the biggest reality shows, quite a few films, and some good TV shows, but I feel I have not really got the positioning I need in the industry. I don’t know why people have typecast me as someone who is gori chitti, thodi si moti and someone who can only do comedy. I want to tell those people that I can do much more.”When asked about the kind of roles she would like to do in 2020, the actress says, “I would love to see myself in a completely different avatar. I would like to play a plus-size, healthy naagin in 2020.” So, is she okay to play a supernatural character? Delnaaz says, “If the show is getting the TRPs, then why not? As an artiste, I don’t want to blame the channel or the producer. People crib about shows like 'Bigg Boss' but it ends with the highest TRPs. The whole genre of naagins and bichchus will continue to rule the screen if the audience keeps consuming them. I feel if you give them feel-good shows or present historical shows in a different format, people will appreciate them.”Delnaaz, who is dating DJ Percy, says marriage is not on her mind right nowDelnaaz may have found her Mr Right in DJ Percy Karkaria but marriage is not on her mind. She says, “We are in a very happy space right now. We are in a live-in relationship, and we like it this way. Marriage is not my mind right now, but as they say, never say never. We are as good as a married couple. Percy had a bitter divorce and so did I, and I think we have had our share of marriage and then divorce, so we both come together as good friends, soulmates who are there for one another. It is a lovely bond that we share.” Percy, who is a professional DJ, has influenced Delnaaz’s music choices, and vice-versa, as she tells us, “His choice of music is very different from mine. I love ‘70s and ‘80s retro hits, especially Kishore Kumar , RD Burman’s. He has started loving all of them because of me. He is more into EDM and contemporary beats. Earlier whenever we would go out, we would have a tiff over the kind of music we would play, but now, we have started enjoying both peppy beats and retro numbers.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73107215,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-97981/73107215.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/delnaaz-irani-would-love-to-play-a-plus-size-naagin/articleshow/73107188.cms

As the years went by, they became the best of friends, fighting against many odds and supporting each other through thick and thin. And now, Ankit Siwach and Nupur Bhatia are all set for another milestone in their relationship.Ankit, who was last seen as the male lead in the TV show, Manmohini , will tie the knot with Nupur, senior marketing manager at a multinational company, on February 4. The actor tells BT, “The marriage and pre-wedding rituals will be a close-knit affair, and they will be held at a resort in Uttarakhand. I have to plan a reception for my friends in Mumbai and a party in my hometown, Meerut, too.”Talking about his ladylove, he says, “Nupur and I have been classmates since kindergarten and friends for almost 20 years now. In our case, the dialogue, ‘Pyaar dosti hai’ (from the 1998 Bollywood hit, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai) is true. We have already spent almost a lifetime together, witnessed the highs and lows with changing circumstances, and accepted each other the way we are. There were times when we were in different cities, even different countries for some time, but we stood by each other through everything.We have come a long way and I am happy that this beautiful relationship is culminating in marriage. I am both nervous and excited to take this step with Nupur.”Like any other relationship, theirs, too, has weathered the test of time and come out stronger. Ankit shares, “There was a time when, as individuals, we went through major changes because of our professions. The way we looked at life was totally different; our approaches were poles apart. I believe everyone hits that low phase in life, which gradually passes, and it all depends on how you emerge out of it. Looking back, I think that the turmoils we faced have helped our relationship become stronger.”Ask Ankit if the fact that he is in a profession full of uncertainties has ever caused any insecurity in their relationship, and he replies, “I have always got my space, even before I joined the industry. Having said that, lifestyle changes and entering a new, unknown space (industry) did affect me. Initially, my insecurities as an actor, and the battle to prove myself created a bubble around me. I could not feel anything except my desire to be an actor; I was very vulnerable. But thankfully, Nupur and I survived that phase, too, and we have both come to the conclusion that acceptance is the only solution. Accept life the way it is — good or bad. What matters is that it should be taken care of, together.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73109077,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-79130/73109077.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/ankit-siwach-to-tie-the-knot-with-girlfriend-nupur-bhatia-on-february-4/articleshow/73108009.cms
18,['6/01/2020'],"Conscious, ethical, vegan and chemical-free: Your guide to sustainable skincare products","When it comes to skincare or hair products, often it’s what’s inside it that counts. If you want to go the sustainable way and clean up your act, we have some handy tips for youClean beauty was probably the biggest celebrity trend of 2019. It refers to products that are mindfully created and don’t have toxic chemicals. They have ingredients ethically sourced and are made with keeping our bodily health and the environment in mind. With celebrities like Kourtney Kardashian and Gwyneth Paltrow regaling fans with benefits of clean beauty, it has also become synonymous with luxury and expensive products. However, that is not necessarily true. As people increasingly ask ‘what is it made up of?’ instead of ‘what will look good on me?’ many homegrown clean beauty brands are providing sustainable alternatives to chemical-laden skincare products from big brands. And if you don’t have access to them or don’t want to spend money on skincare products, ghar ke nuskhe using household ingredients is the best way to protect your skin and the environment.If you wish to switch to sustainable skincare products but have no idea what to look for in a product, here is a simple advice: “A product’s packaging is an indication of the company’s position vis-a-vis environment sustainability. But it may not be enough. The more natural the ingredients are, the more reliable it can be in terms of having a lower ecological impact. Hence, going through the list of ingredients is important if you want to be environmentally conscious,” suggests Shireen Saxena from Ghaziabad, co-founder of Vedic Tattva, a natural and organic personal care range.She adds, “One should also be wary of purchasing such products from large corporations that mass-produce everything as they leave behind a significant carbon footprint in the process. Instead, look for small businesses that offer handcrafted options and use fresher, superior and more natural ingredients.”There are also many DIY experts online who can help you make your own soaps, shampoos, face packs and creams if you have the time and dedication. “In India, people hardly read the ingredients, that is why we try to educate them through our stalls. Educating people about the products they are using is very important. Alternatively, you can also make your own products so that you know what you are putting on your skin,” says Kavita Surana, a resident of Mumbai and co-founder of Iktara, an eco-friendly products range.Shireen says that people are becoming more conscious and have started paying attention to what they are using and spending their money on. “People are becoming more conscious about not just what they eat, but also what they use on themselves. Health, wellness, personal care, sustainability are all interlinked and being conscientious in one would most likely propel you towards the rest,” she tells us.Industry experts say that the trend towards ethical consumerism grew almost 40% in the last year itself. Focussing on the rise of vegan skincare products in India, Madhavi Irani, Chief Officer, Content, Nykaa.com, shares, “In India, too, there is a growing trend towards vegan products by thoughtful consumers who go beyond ‘what’s good for me’ to ‘what’s gone into making the product’.” She adds, “While the Indian cosmetic market has an average growth rate of about 17% each year, the cruelty-free, vegan cosmetics market is set to grow by 6.1% from 2017 - 2023, with India being one of the top exporters of these cosmetics. Most vegan brands do not contain parabens, sulfates and other common cosmetic ingredients that have harmful effects on both the environment and the user.”Vegan products, as the name suggests, are made purely from plant extracts, mostly essential oils and have a healing and soothing impact on the mind and body. They are not tested on animals so vegan products are cruelty-free as well. “Most market-dominating skincare products are synthetic chemicals, during the production of which waste by-products are generated. These ultimately wash down into nature and impede in the sustainability of the environment. In addition, their packaging usually contains non-biodegradable material and their production is energy and water intensive,” says Vinai Saxena, Chairman, KVIC (Khadi and Village Industries Commission), adding, “Some products that can be used naturally like aloe vera, turmeric, cucumber, some oils etc, strangely come back to society in a packaged form in a mix of chemicals that could prove to be environmentally hazardous in the long run.Therefore, replacing synthetic products with natural produce is important.”Talking about khadi products, Vinai says, “The basic premise of khadi skin care products is that they are extracts of naturally occurring plant-based material like roots, leaves, fruits or nuts. Even the medium in which the extracts are preserved and presented are predominantly natural and no chemicals are added. Most importantly, khadi-based production process does not release environmentally harmful by-products, waste water, effluents or emissions.”Roshni Kapoor, a resident of Saket, says, “I survive on bare minimum in terms of buying skincare products from the market. I make my own face packs with besan at home. I look for organic and natural products which are delivered to me in packing material which can be recycled or reused.”Rohini Juneja, a resident of Bangalore who makes handmade soaps, shares some tips to make your own skincare productsEggs are great for hairTurmeric with green gram flour or besan can be used as a body cleanser, and exfoliator.Potatoes can be used if you have burnt your skin from sun’s exposure.Honey is an excellent addition for face and hair masks.You can also make great hair gel at home by just boiling flax seeds in water.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73107607,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-186483/73107607.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/beauty/conscious-ethical-vegan-and-chemical-free-your-guide-to-sustainable-skincare-products/articleshow/73107479.cms

He, however, said he would seek a seat on the board of Tata Sons for improving transparency at the holding company of the Tata Group .""To dispel the misinformation campaign...I intend to make it clear that despite the (December 18, 2019) NCLAT order in my favour, I will not be pursuing the executive chairmanship of Tata Sons, or directorship of TCS, Tata Teleservices or Tata Industries,"" he said in a statement.He said he took the decision as the ""interests of Tata Group are far more important than the interest of any individual"".The scion of the Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) family added that he will, however, ""vigorously pursue all options to protect his family's rights as a minority shareholder, including that of resuming the 30-year history of a board position in Tata Sons and the incorporation of the highest standards of corporate governance and transparency at the company"". The family, with an 18.4% stake in Tata Sons, has been a shareholder of the company since 1965 and was invited to its board in 1980.Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Sons, among others, last week moved the Supreme Court challenging the NCLAT order, stating that restoring Mistry to his original positions to complete his tenures that had expired, would go against the interest of shareholders and create confusion in the working of the companies.Mistry's statement puts to rest the speculation regarding the uncertainty over the future leadership at Tata Sons. Apart from reinstating Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons, a position he held for nearly four years until October 24, 2016, when he was hastily removed in a boardroom coup, the NCLAT held the appointment of his successor N Chandrasekaran as illegal.""This legal fight has never been about me.

""The question in these legal proceedings is whether the oppressive actions of a majority that stifles minority shareholders is beyond reproach and outside judicial oversight.""

NEW DELHI: In significant changes in income tax return filing forms, individual taxpayers owning house property in joint ownership and those who have paid Rs 1 lakh in electricity bills in a year or incurred Rs 2 lakh expense on foreign travel cannot file their annual income return using the simple ITR-1 form .

The government, which usually notifies forms for filing income tax returns by individuals in April every year, on January 3 notified tax return forms for assessment year 2020-21. Returns in ITR-1 Sahaj can be filed by a resident individual whose total income does not exceed Rs 50 lakh, while Form ITR-4 Sugam is meant for resident individuals, HUFs and firms (other than LLP) having a total income of up to Rs 50 lakh and having presumptive income from business and profession.

According to the notification, two major changes in the ITR forms have been effected. First, an individual taxpayer cannot file return either in ITR-1 or ITR-4 if he is a joint owner in house property. Secondly, ITR-1 form is not valid for those individuals who have deposited more than Rs 1 crore in bank account or have incurred Rs 2 lakh or Rs 1 lakh on foreign travel or electricity respectively, it said. Such taxpayers will have to use different forms, which will be notified in due course.

Those who ""own a house property in joint ownership with two or more persons"" are required to furnish a return of income, the notification said.

MUMBAI: A day after CM Uddhav Thackeray allotted portfolios to his ministers, discontent brewed among Congress members over ""the raw deal"" meted out to them. A section of NCP ministers too are unhappy at being ""sidelined"".""Congress has emerged as the biggest loser. It appears that Congress has surrendered before NCP. We never insisted on key portfolios, except for revenue. We accepted the departments offered by NCP and Shiv Sena,"" a senior Congress politician said. An NCP minister said portfolio allocation was decided after a series of meetings with Thackeray, Congress state president Balasaheb Thorat and NCP president Jayant Patil . ""The negotiations were transparent, the senior leaders of all three parties were directly involved. There is no point in crying over spilt milk now,"" the minister said.The Congress politician said NCP has secured all key portfolios, including home, finance and planning, among others. ""As per the original proposal, home was allocated to Sena. But during negotiations, NCP succeeded in securing it. It's the power of the NCP leadership,"" he said.""In the departments allotted to Congress, only revenue and public works are significant,"" he said, pointing out that senior Congress leaders, including Thorat, AICC general secretary Mallikarjun Kharge and former CM Ashok Chavan, failed to secure plum posts for Congress. ""The Congress high command was insisting on departments associated with rural areas,"" he said.""When we were negotiating for departments, it was proposed that either home or the dy CM post should be given to Congress. Both proposals were rejected, with our leaders being silent spectators,"" the Congress politican said.However, within NCP too, things don't seem hunky-dory.

25,['6/01/2020'],Govt expresses concern over tension in oil-producing region,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan (File photo)

VARANASI/ NEW DELHI: Amid rising tensions between the US and Iran, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday expressed concern over the turmoil in the crude-producing region and said efforts are under way to raise domestic production and wean the economy away from oil.

Oil provides 30% of India's primary energy and gas about 6%. Due to low prospects and domestic output, India meets 83% of its crude requirement through imports. As the world's third largest buyer of oil, India's vulnerability to West Asian flare-ups come as two-thirds of the oil and half the LNG (gas carried in ships) imported by India come through the narrow shipping lane between Iran and Oman. So any tension in West Asia pinches consumers in India as global oil price spike drives up domestic pump prices. This squeezes household budgets and dampens consumption as consumers turn cautious over non-essential spending. Higher oil prices limits government's ability to offer freebies or spend on social sector schemes.

Soaring oil pushes up inflation as government's subsidy outgo and industry's input cost rise. It hurts financial and currency markets as higher demand for dollar to pay for oil imports puts pressure on rupee and upsets current account deficit. All these depress market sentiments and consumer appetite, which suppress consumption.

A $10 increase in global crude oil prices shaves off India's GDP by up to 30 basis points (one basis point equals one hundredth of a percentage point). That is one reason why along with efforts to raise domestic production, government is chasing a renewable energy capacity of 175 GW (giga watt) by 2022 as a way to reduce dependence on oil.

NEW DELHI: India's basmati rice exports to Iran are likely to be affected because of rising tensions between the US and the Islamic republic, with domestic trade body AIREA asking exporters not to undertake any shipment till the situation improves.

Iran is an important export destination for India and if shipments get affected then it will impact domestic prices and in turn farmers' income, the All India Rice Exporters Association (AIREA) said. During the last fiscal, India exported basmati rice worth Rs 32,800 crore, of which nearly Rs 10,800 crore worth rice was shipped to Iran.

""In the current situation, it is not possible to export basmati rice to Iran. We have issued an advisory to our members to be cautious and not to execute further shipments till the situation gets clearer,"" said AIREA president Nathi Ram Gupta. The shipments placed by the Iran have also been kept on hold. ""Some quantity is lying at ports,"" Gupta said.

KOLKATA: Indian tea industry is keeping a close watch on the rising Iran-US conflict following the assassination of Iranian commander General Qassim Suleimani in a US drone strike on Friday, as the West Asian nation is the largest importer of the Indian leaf.

While the US sanctions on Iran has not yet hindered the export market of Indian tea in Iran , the current whiff of a new conflagration has left the Tea Inc worried over keeping the business and price realisation intact. The situation has arisen at a time when Iran, a permanent aficionado of Indian orthodox tea, imported a record 50.4 million kg leaves from India in the January-November period of 2019, at a unit price of $3.91 (Rs 280) a kg, against 27.41 million kg recorded in the same period in 2018 (for 11 months).

A Tea Board figure says, in value terms, the tea export to Iran has doubled from the year-ago period.

BUXAR/PATNA: The last Maharaja of Dumraon and the last surviving member of the first Lok Sabha, Kamal Singh, died after a prolonged illness at his Bhojpur Kothi residence at Dumraon, in Bihar's Buxar, on Sunday. He was 94.

He will be cremated with full state honours on the banks of the Ganga at Buxar on Monday. Elected to the first Lok Sabha in 1952 at the age of 25, Singh was the country's youngest MP. He represented Buxar parliamentary constituency in the Lower House as an Independent till 1962. He contested parliamentary polls again in 1989 and 1991 from Buxar on a BJP ticket but lost to CPI's Tej Narayan Yadav on both occasions.

Singh's demise has caused widespread grief in the old Shahabad region where he was regarded for his charity. He is credited with having opened a number of educational institutions and health facilities for the poor.

Expressing grief over his demise, chief minister Nitish Kumar announced that Singh would be cremated with full state honours. In his condolence message, he said Singh had played a key role in the education and health sectors.

PANAJI: An international team of astronomers linked to Nasa , led by an Indian-origin Goa-born scientist, Vithal Tilvi , has discovered a never-before-seen group of galaxies, now labelled EGS77, which is the farthest group of galaxies to have ever been sighted.In 2013, Tilvi was also part of a team that discovered the farthest single galaxy ever sighted by astronomers. The new group of galaxies, EGS77, is estimated to be over 13 billion light years away from the Earth. It took Tilvi and team over four years to make the findings.This group of galaxies can now help astronomers see the Universe directly in its infancy, and see what were the chemicals present when the Universe was just born.""As we look farther and farther, we are looking back in time. This is because, the starlight which carries information about the galaxy group, is reaching the Earth now, after traveling for 13 billion years,"" Tilvi told TOI.""Usually, it is difficult to see galaxies as far as EGS77 because of the presence of neutral hydrogen fog in the Universe, which blocks some of the galaxy light ,"" James Rhoads of Nasa, a team member, said.Fortunately, intense heat from these same galaxies clears the surrounding hydrogen fog, allowing galaxy light to travel freely to the Earth. Galaxies and galaxy group such as EGS77 must have cleared all the hydrogen fog, leading to the transition from opaque to a transparent universe that we see today.""This is a tremendous achievement and will advance our knowledge about how the Universe evolved,"" Tilvi said.The findings of the discovery of EGS77 are being presented for the first time on January 5, at the American Astronomical Society conference in Hawaii.""While this is the first galaxy group identified as being responsible for clearing hydrogen fog, future Nasa missions will tell us much more,"" said Sangeeta Malhotra at Nasa, co-author of the paper ""Onset of Cosmic Reionization: Evidence of An Ionized Bubble Merely 680 Myr (million years) after the Big Bang"".In 2013, Tilvi was part a team that discovered the farthest galaxy in the Universe and, in 2017, he led a team of astronomers that discovered the earliest black hole candidate in the Universe.Currently, he is the project leader for a Nasa-funded project to study this black hole using observations taken by the Hubble Space Telescope . Tilvi is also part of the Nasa's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) team, which is going to be launched in 2025.The distance of EGS77 from the Earth means it is at the very edge of what can be observed using the current best technology on a platform like the Hubble Space Telescope.""The current telescopes we have, like the Hubble Space Telescope, were not meant to discover galaxies this far. But we are pushing the limits. In another one and a half years, James Webb Telescope will be launched, which is much bigger than Hubble Space Telescope, and our plan is to use this new telescope to see groups like EGS77,"" Tilvi said.Tilvi is currently a visiting researcher at the School of Earth & Space Exploration, at the Arizona State University, USA, and is contributing to State Higher Education Council of the government of Goa as a professor of research, development, and innovation.In Video: Goa PIO leads Nasa team to find farthest group of galaxies",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73114328,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-536014,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/goa-pio-leads-nasa-team-to-find-farthest-group-of-galaxies/articleshow/73114330.cms

BJP on Sunday rolled out the heavy artillery for its door-to-door outreach on the new citizenship law , with Union home minister Amit Shah leading the charge by touring south Delhi's refugee colony Lajpat Nagar and holding a party rally where he accused Congress's Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, of ""misleading people"" and ""inciting violence"" during anti-CAA protests.Shah, who visited eight houses, a jhuggi and a temple in Lajpat Nagar, also spoke of how Friday's mob attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan ""was the answer to all those opposing CAA"".""Tell me, if the Sikhs who were attacked at Gurdwara Nankana Sahib will not come to India, then where they will go?"" he said.The home minister called Kejriwal and the Gandhis ""anti-Dalits"" for opposing the amended citizenship law. ""The Prime Minister came up with CAA. It was approved by the Cabinet and then Parliament passed it. Kejriwal misled people...I want to ask people if they want a government in Delhi that instigates riots for vote-bank politics,"" he said during a rally of BJP booth workers at IGI Stadium.On Congress, Shah said Priyanka, who heads the party's east UP unit, had signalled her endorsement of the anti-CAA riots by announcing she would visit the homes of those arrested for violence during the protests.At Lajpat Nagar, he asked people to give missed calls to a toll-free number meant to show support to CAA. He said Muslims had nothing to fear since the new law had no provision to take away anyone's citizenship. ""Your support to the law has now reached Modiji,"" he told a family that dialled the number in front of him.Shah's visit to the colony, where many houses belong to families that migrated from Pakistan after Partition, was not without a murmur of protest. A group of girls was heard shouting ""We reject CAA"" and holding up posters bearing messages like ""Shame NRC"" and ""Azaadi"".In UP, where 23 people died in violence during anti-CAA protests last month, BJP's outreach aimed at Muslims was led by the party's working president JP Nadda in Ghaziabad, defence minister Rajnath Singh in Lucknow and CM Yogi Adityanath in hiis constituency, Gorakhpur. BJP also sent Union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan to Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of PM Narendra Modi , while Union minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi helmed an outreach programme at Dhamaura village in Rampur.Rajnath wove his campaign around ""India's cultural ethos of sarvdharm sambhav (equal respect for all religions)"" and ""vasudhaiva kutumbakam (world is one family)"", telling people that BJP could never violate these values.BJP's ""jan jagran (public awareness)"" drive till January 15 aims to reach out to three crore families and counter the opposition's campaign, which it claims is based on lies.In Jaipur, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman took off from where the home minister left off, saying Congress was ""lying to the nation on CAA"" as part of its ""appeasement"" policy.""Congress has conveniently highlighted some portions of the act while ignoring others, thereby causing confusion.

PATNA: A day after Bihar deputy chief minister and BJP politician Sushil Kumar Modi said the National Population Register ( NPR ) would be updated in the state from May 15 to June 28 this year, ally JD(U)'s national general secretary Pavan K Varma on Sunday asked party chief and CM Nitish Kumar to categorically reject the 'divisive CAA-NPR-NRC scheme'.

In an open letter to the JD(U) chief, Varma expressed surprise at the ""unilateral"" announcement of Sushil Kumar Modi. Modi's office had released a state government's notification on December 18 last year that the process to update the NPR would take place from May 15 to June 28.

""Using the powers conferred under the Census Act-1948, the governor of Bihar hereby issues orders that the work of house listing, house census and updation of NPR be carried out from May 15 to June 28, 2020, in the state of Bihar as part of the first phase of Census of India-2021,"" read the notification signed by the state's additional chief secretary (revenue and land reforms) and state coordinator, census, Vivek Kumar Singh.

Varma has been critical of his party's decision to support the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament. "" ...in consonance with your own publicly stated views, and long established secular vision, may I request you now to take a principled stand against the CAA-NPR-NRC scheme, and reject its nefarious agenda to divide India and create a great deal of unnecessary social turbulence. A clear-cut public statement by you to this effect would be a major step towards preserving and strengthening the idea of India to which, I know, you yourself are committed.

The politics of principle cannot be sacrificed at the altar of short-term political gain,"" Varma, a former diplomat, wrote in his twopage letter.

Varma said the (Union) government had categorically stated that NPR was the first step to implementing NRC and since Kumar had said that Bihar would not have NRC, it followed that he must say no to the revised NPR as well.

KOLKATA: The spurt in infiltration arrests in Bangladesh over the past couple of months - around 450 since mid-November - is the tip of the iceberg. The actual number of Bangladeshis who have returned illegally to their homeland in the wake of the NRC scare could be in the thousands, indicate intelligence and other sources. A process of regular low-key pushbacks is also on, they said.

According to state intelligence sources, over the past few weeks around 200 people have infiltrated into Bangladesh every day through North 24 Parganas alone. People are crossing over in large numbers through the porous border in South 24 Parganas, too, and through Nadia, sources said. An official in Bangladesh said most of those arrested for illegally entering Bangladesh came from Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi. Many of them were carrying Indian ration cards and Aadhaar cards , and some even had Indian voter ID cards , he added.

A North 24 Parganas-based tout, who is part of a racket that sends people without passports to Bangladesh, told TOI that in the past two months they had sent around 5,000 people across the border, several times the usual number.

And the ""fee"" that ghatmaliks (touts) charge each dhur (client) has also risen. Till a couple of months ago, the charge for sending a person to Bangladesh was around Rs 4,000. ""Then people started pouring in from Bengaluru. The charge has now increased to Rs 5,000 and, if the border is 'bad' (if there's strict vigil), Rs 6,000. But these days, the border is rarely bad,"" he added.

Bangladesh administration has formed resistance committees involving border villagers to keep vigil and prevent infiltration. Alamgir Hossain, a member of one such committee in Bangladesh's Jhinaidaha district, said: ""We are on alert. We are trying our best to stop infiltration.""

The Border Security Force would not officially comment on the reverse migration. Sources, however, said Bangladeshis illegally staying in India are being pushed back. On December 29, at a joint press briefing by the BSF and Border Guards Bangladesh, the BGB DG, Shafeenul Islam, said: ""We regularly apprehend people who cross the border. These are Bangladeshis who came into India inadvertently or for work."" In all, 446 people were arrested by the BGB since November, Islam said.""But since they are originally from Bangladesh, the charges being made against them are very light so that they can easily get bail,"" a Bangladeshi official told TOI.

""They told us their horror stories - of being threatened and slapped, of midnight knocks on doors by members of a particular political party. They claimed they didn't get any help from the administration or police,"" said the official.

TOI tried to contact the Bangladeshi deputy high commissioner regarding the issue but there was no response.

GORAKHPUR: After launching a crackdown on anti-CAA rioters and slapping recovery notices on many others for allegedly damaging public property, UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Sunday embarked on an outreach programme in the Muslim-dominated Gorakhnath area to ""dispel doubts"" and drum up support for the new citizenship law .

Launching the campaign from his mutt, Yogi walked down to a shop owned by one Chowdhary Kaifulwara and stood facing a crowd. Handing out copies of a booklet that purportedly clears the air on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, he said the law had been amended to give citizenship rather than snatch it from any community.

""Read the booklet to remove your doubts,"" he said.

Appealing to the Muslim community not to pay heed to rumours, he said: ""It is our tradition to give shelter to persecuted people from other countries. PM Modi brought CAA to give citizenship to these people, but Congress, Samajwadi Party and its allies are trying to mislead people by spreading confusion and fomenting violence.""

On behalf of the community, Kaifulwara submitted three memorandums to the CM, one of which seeks the release of ""protesters without a criminal background"".

All of these people were arrested during the anti-CAA protests in Gorakhpur on December 20. Raja Ram Yadav, who teaches chemistry at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gorakhpur University, told TOI that the outreach should have been launched before the law was passed, triggering protests. Ashfaq, another resident, said: ""The CM has rightly said we should read about CAA before staging protests.""

Party circulated the letter written by the service provider, which said the number was allotted for BJP's 'missed call' campaign . The party's retaliation came after several memes and misleading posts emerged on social media about the number (8866288662), alleging it to be linked to Netflix.

Addressing a 'Booth Karyakarta Sammelan' in Delhi, Shah said the number was launched for people to give missed call and show their support to the law, and had nothing to do with Netflix. ""Since yesterday (Saturday), rumours are being spread that the number belongs to some channel called Netflix. I would like to clarify that the number never belonged to Netflix. Rather, it is BJP's toll-free number,"" Shah said. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged vulgar claims like people can speak to girls by dialling this number were being made.

File photo for representation

AHMEDABAD: Two government hospitals in Rajkot and Ahmedabad have together reported 199 infant deaths in December, constituting almost 25 per cent of the total number of admissions that month. Rajkot Civil Hospital accounted for 111 of these crib deaths , which works out to 28 per cent of the newborns admitted there in December.

According to figures released by the state health department on Sunday, Rajkot and Ahmedabad civil hospitals recorded 269 and 253 infant deaths respectively between October and December 2019.

Deputy CM Nitin Patel, who is also the health minister, said the high infant mortality rate was unfortunate ""but within limit"". He claimed that patients from outside the state being treated at these state-run hospitals was partially responsible for the spike in numbers.

State Congress president Amit Chavda said the high rate of infant deaths might not be restricted to Ahmedabad and Rajkot alone. ""This number may run into thousands if hospitals across the state are taken into account,"" he said.

The deputy CM accused Congress, under fire for a spate of crib deaths at JK Lon Hospital in Rajasthan's Kota, was trying to divert attention from its own failure elsewhere. ""I would like to ask the Congress governments in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh why patients from these neighbouring states come to Gujarat hospitals for treatment if they have good health care systems in place?"" he said.

At Rajkot Civil Hospital, there were 388 admissions to the newborn intensive care unit in December. Of these, 160 were cases referred from other health care facilities. At Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, which reported 88 deaths in December, 415 children had been admitted that month, of whom 243 were referred from other health facilities, the health department said.

While clearly drawing the line between cases from within the hospital and those referred from other health facilities within or outside the state, Patel said that from October to December, 1,296 cases were treated at the Rajkot hospital, of which 499 had been referred from elsewhere. In Ahmedabad, of the 1,357 infants treated during that period, 802 had been referred from other facilities.

Patel said underweight infants, unhealthy mothers, improper pregnancy practices and lack of awareness about mother-and-child health were some of the reasons that had contributed to crib deaths. ""We are creating awareness and also setting up more SNCUs and Bal Sakha units across the state. The health of pregnant women is tracked through an online system.""

Based on data shared by the health department, the mortality rates of patients admitted to the special newborn care unit of the Rajkot hospital were 19.3%, 15.5% and 28% of the total patients admitted in October, November and December respectively. Officials claimed that 35-40% of the children referred from other hospitals were already in a critical condition when they were brought in.

At Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, 91 infants died in October, 74 in November and 88 in December. The mortality rates were 18.4%, 16.4% and 21.2% respectively. Here, too, the ratio of patients referred from other hospitals and health care facilities was more than 55%, officials said.

""According to the recently-published Sample Registration Bulletin (SRB) by the central government for the year 2017, Gujarat had infant mortality rate (IMR) of 30 - which means, 30 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. We are better than states such as Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan,"" the deputy CM said. ""Our internal data collection mechanism indicates IMR of 25 or below.""

JAIPUR: Three more infants died at Kota's JK Lon Hospital , taking the death toll to 110 in the past 36 days.A day after deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot visited the facility - which falls under Kota government medical college (GMC) - and advocated to fix responsibility for the infant deaths, there were reports of replacing the paediatric department head Amritlal Bairwa.Dr Vijay Sardana, principal and controller of Kota GMC, however, denied the reports. ""We have not received any such information from the government about JK Lon's paediatrics HoD being replaced,"" he told TOI on Sunday.After the infant deaths came to light in the last week of December, the hospital hurriedly removed its medical superintendent, Dr HL Meena, from his post and appointed Dr Suresh Dulara in his place. Dr Dulara said, ""Dr Bairwa has not completed his two-year tenure as the paediatrics HoD yet."" The investigation report issued by the facility even gave a clean chit to its staff, citing that the children who had died were already critical.The infant deaths not only brought to light that at least 50% of the life-saving equipment at the hospital was lying defunct but also highlighted that the place was reeling under staff shortage.A letter issued by the hospital's paediatrics department to the Kota GMC mentioned that out of 33 sanctioned posts - professor, associate professor, assistant professor, senior resident, resident doctor and junior postgraduate - seven are lying vacant. Two out of three professor posts and all four associate professor posts are vacant, while two posts of senior resident and one resident doctor post are yet to be filled.With over 100 infant deaths leading to massive outrage, the GMC made arrangements to fill the vacant posts and deployed more doctors at the hospital's paediatric department to tackle the crisis. ""One professor and four assistant professors have been added to the existing healthcare staff,"" said Dr Sardana.The letter was issued on November 22, 2019, ahead of MCI's inspection for the first renewal of permission for increasing MBBS seats at the GMC from 150 to 250 in 2020-21.In Video: Infant death toll in Kota hospital rises",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73114368,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-292196,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-more-infants-die-at-kota-hospital-toll-at-110/articleshow/73114369.cms
37,['6/01/2020'],Surat processes 95% of the solid waste city generates in one day,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Representative image

SURAT: The Surat Municipal Corporation seems to have taken National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) bashing around 10 months ago for not disposing or reprocessing its solid waste quite seriously.

At least, the Swaccha Sarvekshan 2019 rankings speaks for itself with the Diamond City climbing up to the fourth position in the country from the dismal 14th, a year ago.

One of the major reasons it credits for this change is its quick reprocessing of solid waste generated by the city daily. Of the 1,800 tonne waste, it reprocess almost 95% (1,720 tonnes) every day, SMC claims.

Only about 80 tonne waste, which is being dumped at Khajod waste disposal site, gets accumulated. However, under NGT’s directives, this site too will be shifted within 18 months.

Surat spends more than Rs 25 crore to keep the city comprising more than 50 lakh population and nearly 14 lakh households clean.

Things started to change in the past two years when demand for low generation of waste and reprocessing of all types of generated waste began with earnestness. Dumping of city’s waste stopped at the Khajod landfill site and all types of wet waste, mostly organic waste, started getting converted in to compost at a number of places.

From big residential societies to vegetable markets and even at Khajod, plants were set up to process organic waste in to manure. Today, nearly 800 tonnes of wet waste is converted in to manure. Similarly, 750 to 800 tonnes of dry waste is recycled in to refuse derived fuel (RDF). In case, the fuel doesn’t get any buyers, it is dumped at Khajod site, which has not been barred by law.

Additional city engineer in-charge of SMC solid waste department, EAH Pathan said, “We have material recovery facility where all the recyclable elements of the waste are separated at all the sub-stations. Buyers are sent plastic waste, e-waste and construction and demolition waste separately from the site where a 300 tonnes plant segregates the wastes.”

Municipal Commissioner Bancchanidhi Pani said, “Surat probably is the only city that processes its own waste fully. It will help the city in the long run. It is also indirectly helping the city create its own wealth from Waste to Wonder, or Wow!”

Representative image

KOLKATA: With the temperature sliding sharply, examinees who appeared for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test ( NEET ) on Sunday from various centres in Bengal for admission to MD and MS courses were given certain relaxation at some centres. They were allowed to wear on full sleeved clothes, which were not in accordance to the new exam norms. However, all centres refused to allow belts, wrist watches and wallets.

To comply with the security rules for the exam, some candidates at a centre in New Town were seen leaving their winter wear with those who had accompanied them to the hall. Md Wasim Aktar said that at the centre he had to report to, many examinees were allowed inside with full-sleeved sweaters. However, he said that his wrist watch was not allowed due to chances of malpractice. Similarly, Debajyoti Kar another examinee, said that at his centre, candidates were allowed to wear full-sleeved sweaters and shoes. However, Andrevich Saha, another candidate, said he did not wear a full-sleeved sweater to the examination centre and those who did were asked to leave them outside. “I had to take off my buckled chappals and socks and even had to leave my handkerchief outside,” he said.

Worried about cheating, the National Board of Examination (NBE), which conducted NEET, enforced exceptional security measures.

The reporting time for the test was between 1.30pm and 3pm and the test went on from 3.30pm to 7pm. The NBE enforced a strict restriction on entering the exam centre with cellphones. The admit cards clearly mentioned that use of mobiles, pen drives, calculators, pagers, tablets, bluetooth devices or any electronic gadget would lead to legal action. Moreover, the verification of candidates before entry into the exam centres was stricter to weed out impersonators. The examinees had to provide their medical council registration certificate along with their Aadhaar or PAN card and ensure they matched with the NEET admit cards.

The admit cards also mentioned rings, earrings, bracelets, chains and necklaces with pendants were prohibited inside the halls and some of the examinees said they were frisked with hand-held metal detectors before being allowed inside the exam centre.

The test was held with CCTV cameras monitoring the examinees and the footage will be sent to NBE. An official said that to reduce chances of malpractice, all examinees had to write their answers on individual desktops and the monitors were guarded to discourage candidates from looking at their neighbours’ screens. Moreover, there were different sets of questions to ensure that examinees couldn’t help each other out.

Amravati: In a tragic incident, a 16-year-old Std IX student of Titamba residential tribal school, about 17km from Dharni in the district, was electrocuted after accidentally touching a high tension line running through a tree, on Sunday morning.

The deceased, Rakesh Ramkaran Jawarkar, had climbed the tree on the hostel premises to cut a branch for making ‘gilli’ and ‘danda’ from it to play with friends. The kids, Rakesh and his friends, Roshan Mavaskar (Std VIII) and Kartik Sutarkar (Std IX), had wanted to play volleyball but the school superintendent allegedly refused to give the ball claiming it was punctured.

Rakesh died on the spot after coming in contact with the 1,100KV high tension line of MSEDCL. Kartik, who too was on the tree, had a lucky escape.

The frightened friends informed the superintendent Ganesh Thombe, who alerted the police patil and village sarpanch. Relatives of Rakesh were also informed. School head master, identified as only Botke, is on a compulsory leave following suspension process going on against him by Mitali Sethi, project officer, Integrated Tribal Development Project, Dharni, said sources.

Sports teacher CG Borde too was not in the school when the incident took place. Sources also said no official from MSEDCL visited the spot after the incident.

According to the school administration, it has written to MSEDCL several times for removing the HT wire but to no avail. Sethi said inquiry will be conducted and action would be taken against those found at fault.

She said all care would be taken to avoid recurrence of such incident in future. She also said that demand will be made to shift HT wires running over the ashram schools or hostels. She also assured compassionate help to Rakesh’s family.

40,['6/01/2020'],Patent office rejects Tatas’ plea for Swach water purifier,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Rupali Mukherjee | TNN

Mumbai: Patent wars have intensified in the water purifier market, with biggies Tata Chemicals and Hindustan Unilever ( HUL ) slugging it out in courts.

The Delhi patent office has rejected an application by Tata Chemicals for its water purifier Swach on grounds of it being “obvious” and “lacking in inventive step”. The plea was rejected on January 2, on a pre-grant opposition filed a decade ago by HUL, which owns the Pureit brand.

Over the years, the market has witnessed several such court battles between major players — HUL, Eureka Forbes and Tata Chemicals. In 2012, HUL lost its patent on Pureit, when the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) ruled the technology used by it was not new, and was obvious.

Simply put, inventive step means a feature of the invention that involves technical advance over what is known, and not something obvious to a person skilled in that art (field), according to the Patent Act. Legal sources told TOI the Patent Office relied on a previous case where Tata Chemicals had succeeded in getting HUL’s patent concerning its Pureit brand, revoked in 2012.

Pratap Chandra Barad, assistant controller of patents & designs, said in the order, a copy of which is available with TOI, “the objection served regarding inventive step in the hearing notice is not met in view the reasoning made in the applicant Agent’s in his/her reply dated 10.09.2019. So, in view above, I found, alleged invention is novel but lacks inventive step, and obvious to a person skilled in the art. Therefore, I hereby refuse to grant the above patent application as per The Patents Act, 1970 (as amended)”. Mumbai-based Tata Chemicals and Tata Consultancy had filed the patent application in July 2008 through Obhan & Associates, while the HUL side was represented by Subhatosh Majumdar of S Majumdar & Co.

The order said, “Based on the argument of both applicant and opponent, all the patent documents and the present patent application relate to filtering of water through reverse-flow mechanism and essentially bears an inlet passage for flow of water to move downwards, reach bottom and flow upwards through reverse flow/U mechanism and moves out of the filter media. The main invention lies on provision of bottom chamber and the outlet through a centrally placed hollow passage and connected to the nozzle for controlled uniform flow of water through the filter cartridge. The provision of an outlet through a centrally placed hollow passage and connected to the nozzle is a matter of design which is but obvious to a skilled person and the petitioner (applicant herein) in IPAB order no.166 of 2012, as well as the IPAB had held that flow of water through outlet can be achieved in a desired manner and no inventive step can be attributed to such provision of outlet”.

According to the Tata group, “The design of the claimed device is such that filtration medium doesn’t get impacted because in villages it may be used in a different way, and uneven force and pressure may be applied to the filter so it is designed in such a manner that it is able to sustain for a long time. The applicant submitted that the design ensures the uniform flow of water into the filter and at the outlet end water flow is controlled using nozzle. The applicant further referred to the numerous awards received by the Tata Swach device including the ‘design of the decade’ award.”

While the opponent said, “In recent years, the anticipation law has undergone major changes and therefore while evaluating novelty effect of such additional components needs also needs to be taken into consideration. In this context reference was made to IPAB order no. 166 of 2012... In the instant case also, it is submitted that the provision for outlet passage /nozzle amounts to cosmetic changes over the cited prior art and hence cannot attribute any novelty to the water purification device allegedly claimed in the impugned application”.

A Tata Chemicals spokesperson said: “We are in the process of reviewing the order that was uploaded yesterday by the Patent Office. Decision to appeal will be taken post review.”

PATNA: The government rail police (GRP) on Saturday arrested two brothers for allegedly killing Dinanath Paswan (20) at Jethuli under River police station area in eastern Patna on December 2 night.

The arrested persons, Ashok Yadav (32) and Sindhu Yadav (22), along with their father and three more siblings are accused of killing Paswan after he was caught in an objectionable position with one of their brother’s wife inside his bedroom at Jethuli.

Paswan’s body in underwear was recovered from the railway tracks near Jethuli around 8am on December 3 after which an FIR was lodged with Banka Ghat GRP station. The deceased was a native of neighbouring Baikatpur village under Khusrupur police station area in the district.

Banka Ghat GRP SHO Chotelal Prasad said Vinod Rai (24) and his brothers Pintu Rai and Sonu Rai besides their father Chattri Rai (55) were evading arrest. He said the deceased as well as the accused were daily wagers.

“After preliminary investigation, it surfaced that Paswan had gone to married woman’s house on Thursday night. He along with the woman was caught inside the family’s residence in objectionable position when the five brothers and their father returned home,” the SHO said.

Quoting Ashok and Sindhu, Prasad said they killed Paswan in a fit of rage. “They used a sharp weapon kept for cutting grass and slit his throat. They also cut Paswan’s right arm at three places. Later, they carried the body for more than two kilometres after packing it in a sack and dumped it near the railway track. The motive was to give the murder a colour of train accident,” the SHO said.

He said forensic experts had found bloodstains on the walls of the bedroom where Paswan was killed though the accused had tried to wash it with water. He said the weapon used in the killing was also recovered from haystack on their premises and it also had bloodstains on it. Prasad said raids were on to nab the other accused persons in the case.

Sanjay Kumar Agarwal

PATNA: Nine public service centres (Jan Sewa Kendra) will be operational in the city in February and 19 more in April, according to Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal.

The 28 centres will cover all six circles of Azimabad, Bankipore , Kankarbagh, New Capital, Patliputra and Patna City of the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC).

The Jan Sewa Kendra is to provide services relating to utility bills and documents such as birth and death certificates, arms licences and verification of household documents among others.

Reviewing the Smart City projects under Patna Smart City Limited (PSCL) here on Saturday, Agarwal instructed the private firms to expedite the construction of Jan Sewa Kendras. “Finishing touches are to be given to the buildings of nine centres to be operational in February. These centres are in New Capital (ward numbers 3 and 14), Kankarbagh (ward numbers 21 and 22), Bankipore (ward numbers 38, 43 and 46) and Patna City circle (ward numbers 53 and 58). Only the finishing work is left on these nine buildings,” he said.

Earlier, the PMC had proposed 80 Jan Sewa Kendras, but the PSCL approved only 28 centres in the city.

Agarwal, who is also the chairman of PSCL, said the G+2 building will be the access points for delivery of essential public utility services like birth and death certificates, ration card, social welfare schemes, healthcare, financial, education and agriculture services among other services. “The remaining 19 buildings in ward numbers 4, 11, 22A, 24, 26, 28, 29, 33, 34, 39, 42, 49, 51, 56, 59, 61, 65, 67 and 72 will be ready by April,” he said.

He added: “The centres will make the civic body’s functioning transparent and easily accessible for people. Once the Jan Sewa Kendra is functional, people will not have to queue up at PMC office to get their work done.”

The estimated cost of each centre is around Rs45 lakh and all the buildings will be identical. Jan Seva Kendra building will house the office of ward councillor and counters to provide the civic services to residents.

According to sources at PSCL, the centres would be located ideally in areas having a high public gathering to have the maximum coverage in a particular ward. These centres will be linked through the proposed Integrated Command and Control Centre, which would come up on the premises of Patna police headquarters.

PATNA: A station diary has been lodged against jailed former RJD MP Md Shahabuddin for allegedly threatening special public prosecutor of Siwan Jai Prakash Singh during trial in a case on Friday. Shahabuddin is currently lodged in Delhi’s Tihar jail .

Siwan SP Abhinav Kumar said on Sunday that a sanha (station diary) has been registered with the Mufassil police station of the district on the statement of public prosecutor Singh, who apprehended threat to him, his family and assistants from the former Siwan MP.

In addition, the threat perception to the complainant is also being assessed by the police. “If required, the district administration will provide security to the PP. The process of assessment of his threat perception is already under way,” the SP told this newspaper over phone.

Abhinav, who was shifted to Siwan from City SP (west) in Patna on Thursday, said he has just assumed charge as SP and am personally looking into the complaint of the Spl PP. “The threat perception to the witness in the case is also being looked into,” the SP said.

According to the complaint, Shahabuddin threatened him with dire consequences during trial in a case related to murderous attack on a CPI-ML (Liberation) worker Subhash Baitha. The case is being heard in the special court headed by R S Pandey.

Shahabuddin had deposed in the case through videoconferencing. Siwan additional public prosecutor Ramraj Prasad said on Sunday that a petition pertaining to the misbehaviour and threat to the special public prosecutor by the accused had also been submitted to the court.

Shahabuddin was shifted to Tihar jail from Bhagalpur on the Supreme Court’s directive in 2017 after a sharp shooter, who was evading arrest in connection with the murder of Siwan journalist Rajdev Ranjan, was found missing after his release.

Rajdev was shot dead by armed criminals near the fruits market in Siwan in July 2016. The murder case trial is still in progress. Shahabuddin has been accused of hatching the conspiracy to kill the journalist for publishing a series of articles against him.

PATNA: Flight operations at Jayaprakash Narayan International (JPNI) Airport were affected as skies remained covered with clouds on Sunday as well. Around 12 flights were delayed due to poor visibility .

According to a weather scientist at Patna Meteorological Centre, the minimum 1,000m visibility was achieved at 5.30am. However, it slipped to 900m afterwards. “After 7.30am, the visibility again reached to 1,000m and gradually improved,” the weather scientist said.

Meanwhile, scattered light rain and thunderstorm activities were witnessed at isolated places in the state. According to weathermen, Patna would witness colder nights over the next few days. The day temperature, however, is likely to increase in the city.

In its bulletin issued on Sunday, Skymet Weather stated that minimum temperatures would start dropping by around 2-3 degrees Celsius while the maximums would increase by some degrees over the next 24 to 48 hours. “There are chances of moderate to dense fog in many parts of the state in the next 24 hours,” it said.

The weather conditions in the state would again become dry due to formation of cyclonic circulation in Gangetic West Bengal.

According to the Skymet Weather bulletin, another spell of rain and thundershower is expected in eastern parts of the country on January 8 and 9.

Patna Meteorological Centre stated in its weather bulletin on Sunday that light rainfall occurred at one or two places in south-east Bihar in the past 24 hours. Highest maximum and lowest minimum temperatures of 23.1 degrees Celsius and 10 degrees Celsius, respectively, were recorded at Sabour in Bhagalpur on Sunday.

A Patna Meteorological Centre official said a fresh western disturbance over Afghanistan and adjoining areas would bring scattered rain and thunderstorm at isolated places in Bihar on January 8 and 9. “Shallow to moderate fog would prevail at one or two places in the state in the morning hours during the next 24 hours,” the official added.

KOLKATA: The minimum temperature started dipping from Sunday. At 14.8°C, the figure was, however, one notch higher than the normal mark. The Met office said that it will drop further to hover around 12°C-13°C by Monday.

“The cloud mass — that had covered the city sky early on Sunday — is expected to disappear by Monday. This will facilitate the decline of the mercury by about 2°C-3°C further, pushing it below the normal mark,” said GK Das, director ( weather ) at Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Kolkata.

A week ago, the city experienced a chilly weather with the mercury plunging to 11.1°C — the lowest this season. Even as the temperature remained below 12°C constantly for a few days, moisture incursion from the bay stemmed its decline.

The residual moisture in the aftermath of Thursday’s rain had pushed up the mercury to 16.1°C on Saturday, which was three notches above normal.

“Since there is no major system to interfere with the winter chill at present, the weather should remain pleasantly constant for now,” Das added.

The cold and dry northwesterly wind has started blowing into the city, clearing the deck for the mercury to fall. But as northern India —the region from where this wind system originates — is not reeling under intense cold wave at present, the temperature in Kolkata is unlikely to go below 12°C this time.

Weathermen said although the sun is likely to emerge out of the cloud cover on Monday, the early mornings could be foggy. But they said that the fog will not be dense enough to raise visibility issues, specially for flights to and from the city.

Students protest outside JNU campus, after some masked miscreants attacked in the campus (PTI Photo)

NEW DELHI: The violence at JNU on Sunday night evoked a sharp reaction from leaders across the political spectrum.

While former Congress president Rahul Gandhi alleged that “fascist forces were controlling the country”, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said it was a shame on “democracy”. BJP, however, said that “forces of anarchy” with “shrinking political footprint” were using students to “create unrest”.

At least 18 people, including JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh, were injured in the violence and admitted to AIIMS.

While Union home minster Amit Shah spoke to Delhi Police commissioner to inquire about the situation, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted about urging lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to direct police to “restore order”.

Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra questioned the “silence” of police over the entire episode. “#JNU Why are police silent on hooliganism? Sir @CPDelhi, don’t you see hooliganism being practised publicly? Wow! There are no police to stop hooliganism at JNU, but have force to subject students with inhuman behaviour by forcibly entering Jamia hostel,” Chopra tweeted in Hindi.

Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee tweeted: “We strongly condemn brutality unleashed agst students/teachers in JNU. No words enough to describe such heinous acts. A shame on our democracy. Trinamool delegation led by Dinesh Trivedi (Sajda Ahmed, Manas Bhunia, Vivek Gupta) headed to DEL to show solidarity with #ShaheenBagh #JNU (sic).”

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury alleged that there was a connivance between the JNU administration and ABVP “goons”. “Reports coming from JNU point to a collusion between the administration and goons of ABVP to inflict violence on students and teachers. It is a planned attack by those in power, which is afraid of the resistance provided by JNU to its Hindutva agenda,” he tweeted.

During the meeting three names have surface to replace incumbent president Vinay Tendulkar.BJP national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Arun Singh held a one-on-one meeting with chief minister Pramod Sawant, core committee members and junior defence minister Shripad Naik to finalise the new BJP state president.The new president would be announced within a fortnight and the consultation process has been completed, Tendulkar told TOI.BJP sources said that the names which came up during the consultation process were of the three general secretaries — Sadanand Tanawade, Damodar Naik and Narendra Sawaikar. Sources said that all three are connected with the grassroot-level party workers and one of them would be chosen as the party president.Tanawade belongs to Maratha community, Naik is from Bhandari community and Sawaikar hails from Hindu priest community.The Bhandari community, which constitutes nearly 30% of the electorate and is classified under OBC, plays a decisive role in Goa’s electoral politics, followed by the Maratha samaj.Party sources said that as chief minister Pramod Sawant hails from the Maratha samaj, having a Bahujan leader at the helm of the party organisation would help balance the caste equation.Sources said that BJP has always elected its party president unanimously and no election is required.“When the name of the party president is announced all others accept the decision and work of the party,” BJP sources said.While BJP has always considered caste factor to keep each and everyone happy within the party, it would be interesting this time to see if the same formula is used to elect a new president or if the party adopts a different strategy in view the political situation in the state.In absence of former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, the party is looking at a candidate who can go around the state and expand its base in the state.Currently, BJP has 27 MLAs in the 40-member assembly.

Kolkata: The third edition of this season’s Happy Streets , organised by The Times Of India in association with Bidhannagar City Police and presented by Shyam Steel, started off the year’s first Sunday with a bang. Thousands took over the T-junction in front of Central Park at Salt Lake to participate in various fun events.

The 2km stretch was a hub of activities with something for everyone — from youngsters to the elderly — to enjoy with their friends and families. The morning started off with a zumba session by Dropbeats, which got the young crowd moving, warming up the atmosphere. This was followed by a dance performance by Sohinimoksha and her students from the shelter home Little Big Help. A gymnastics performance by Mridula Debnath came right after, which kept the crowd hooked.

There was a whole lot of other activities for the revellers to participate in and enjoy, including skating by Fun On Wheels for the kids and karate by Kolkata Gojukai Karate Do, which had people from the crowd throw a few punches and kicks. The children had a lot of other things to participate in, like an activity by BakeDiets, Little Gym and Active Aerobics. There was also a yoga and cross-fit session by SAS Fitness for fitness enthusiasts.

Apart from these, there were zones to play cricket, football, basketball, badminton, tug of war and several other outdoor games. Many turned up in large groups of friends and family just to spend some quality time together.

A group of friends came from Baguiati to soak in the atmosphere and enjoy the chilly morning. “I heard about Happy Streets and have come here for the first time. The atmosphere is electrifying,” said Susant Jha, a college student.

Nine-year-old Abheri Bhattacharya had been waiting to come to Happy Streets ever since she came to know that it was going to be organized close to her house. “I am excited to be here,” she said.

Anil Kumar Ghosh, a 73-year-old resident of Salt Lake came with his granddaughter Anwesha Sarkar. “I come to this event every year. It is such a nice initiative. These kinds of events also help spread awareness about, and reduce, pollution,” he said.

Muzaffarpur DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh and SSP Jayant Kant carried out massive search operations in every ward of the jail. Sources said several businessmen in Muzaffarpur get frequent extortion calls from the jail inmates and that was another reason for conducting the raids.

“We found that the tower locations of most of the cellphones through which extortion calls had been made were around the jail area.

The raids were also conduct to review the legitimacy and grounds on which inmates are admitted to the jail hospitals.

Incidentally, Manish was also in the jail hospital when he was shot dead by another inmate Raja Babu at the behest of Manish’s rival Anu Singh. Anu is also lodged in Hajipur jail.

Manish and Anu were involved in gold loot in different states and they had a dispute over sharing the booty, leading to the murder, according to police.

Mishra said FIRs were lodged for recovery of prohibited items from jails and action would be taken against erring officers for security lapses.

PATNA: Amid a chilly start to the new year, vendors selling different varieties of tea like ‘tandoori chai’ and ‘masala chai’ in the city are raking in the moolah. ‘Kulhad chai’ is also in demand among tea lovers.

To many, tea is a rejuvenating drink that is popular among people belonging to all age groups — from office-goers to students and elderly people.

According to some vendors, who sell ‘tandoori chai’, more than 250 customers visit their stalls daily. One of them, Rajesh, told this newspaper, “I have been selling ‘tandoori chai’ for the last three years. In summers, I usually prepare around 130 cups of tea every day, but the demand increases as the temperature goes down. These days, I am selling more than 300 cups.”

Another tea seller on Jagdeo Path claimed that his regular customers flocked to his shop more than four times a day. “My tea, which is available at a price of Rs 25 per cup, has a unique and subtle smoky flavour,” he said.

‘Kulhad chai’, ‘tapdi chai’ and ‘masala chai’ are the other most sought-after varieties in the city. “A lot of people tell me to make flavoured tea by adding ginger and cardamom to it. This not only enhances the taste, but also keeps the body warm,” said Upendra, a tea seller on Bailey Road.

Some ‘ chai wallahs ’ consider winter season the best time for selling tea. “Although my work has increased, I am making good money. While I earn around Rs 800 every day during summers, the amount doubles in the winter season,” said Kumar Shivam, another vendor on Bailey Road.

Meanwhile, teaholics, are learning to make different varieties of tea at home. Phulwarisharif resident Anzum Fatima said, “I am a huge fan of the ‘tandoori chai’ sold at roadside stalls. I, however, prefer home-made food and drinks and so, am learning to make it at home.”

Representative image

PATNA: A new division of postal department will be created in the district in the current financial year apart from the existing Patna division . The new division, to be known as Patna Sahib division, will cover areas like Bakhtiyarpur, Mokama, Barh and Punpun. These areas currently come under the Nalanda postal division.

A new head post office will be created for this division at Lohianagar in Kankarbagh which will act as its operating wing while a section of Patna Sahib post office will act as the administrative wing for the new division.

Elaborating on the blueprint of the Patna Sahib division, public relations officer of General Post Office Pawan Kumar said, “The existing post office at Lohianagar will be renovated and made bigger so that it could be developed as a head post office. The second floor of the Patna Sahib post office will be renovated and used as administrative wing,” he added.

Anil Kumar, chief post master general (east Bihar ) said it was necessary to form a new division as more areas could not be included under the Patna division which already covers many postal areas. “A new division will help the postal department deliver services effectively to people,” he added.

Kumar said, “The Patna Sahib division will have 22 sub-post offices and 180 branch offices under it. Apart from this, it will have three sub-divisions – Barh, eastern Patna and south-central Patna. The new division will cover areas like Barh, Mokama, Punpun and Bakhtiyarpur which currently come under the Nalanda division,” he added.

56,['6/01/2020'],"In an email &amp; WhatsApp age, postcard still holds its charm","This story is from January 6, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: Sounds incredible, but it is a fact that even in an age of emails, SMSs and WhatsApp messages, postcard continues to be a preferred mode of communication for millions of Indians. The number of postcards (costing 50 paisa each) used by people for sending messages every year in the country exceeds 100 crore.

It is true that there has been considerable decline in the use of postcards and inland letters, particularly in urban areas, where private courier services, email and SMS are preferred over the post. While email is convenient, private couriers are known to be quicker in delivering letters and packages. The use of these once common postal facilities has gone down even in towns and villages, with the availability of mobile telephone services that has changed the systems of communication quite dramatically.

According to the postal department data received by RTI activist Subhash Chandra Agrawal, the traffic of postcards dropped 76% from a little over 336 crore in 1999-2000 to about 78 crore in 2008-09. However, the use of postcards has increased again to 106 crore in 2017-18.

The postmaster of Patna University Post Office, Manoj Kumar, said on an average, one post card is sold every day from his post office. He admitted that there has been considerable rise in the use of Speed Posts in recent years and the post office witnesses huge rush of students and unemployed youths whenever some job vacancies are advertised. Application forms are sent through Speed Post, he said.

The sub-postmaster of S K Puri post office in Patna said he had requisitioned 300 postcards six months back, but hardly a dozen pieces have been sold since then. There are very few buyers of postcards or inland letters these days. Until a decade back, the post offices used to have huge piles of letters of all sorts and the postal staff had to face herculean task in sorting and delivering them at the correct addresses.

But, postcards are still in circulation in rural areas and the poor people can easily afford to buy them for sending messages. Postcards are cheaper than a phone call or even an SMS.

Even in urban areas, some people prefer using postcards as they feel it is hard to ignore the human element in such communications. “Every day, people receive any number of emails, SMSs and WhatsApp messages; they either ignore them or delete them. But handwritten postcards, having become a novelty thanks to their declining use, make people sit up and take note,” said a retired professor of Magadh University , Badri Narain Singh.

Retired telecom engineer G S Singh echoed the same sentiments. “The postcard commands a certain sense of timelessness. It requires a precise, direct, and honest form of writing, whether you are writing a personal or a political message. In fact, now postcard stories are becoming popular all over the world,” he said.

The humble postcard and inland letters are breathing their last and they may disappear soon in the same way as did the chavanni (25-paise coin), quipped Ajay Shankar Sharan of Nalanda Open University.

On 5th January, when the students who have registered in the winter semester wanted to enter these school buildings, they were physically prevented by the agitating students. Since the 5th January afternoon, the preventing campus has witnessed scuffles at the Schools as well as inside the hostel premises,” the statement said.It added that the violence on Sunday started around 4.30pm. “...A group of students, who are against the registration process moved aggressively from the front of the admin block and reached the hostels. The administration immediately contacted the Police to come quickly and maintain law and order on the campus. However, by the time police came, the students who are for the registration were beaten up by a group of agitating students opposing the registration,” said the statement, signed by JNU registrar Pramod Kumar.Terming the violence “unfortunate”, the administration said it strongly condemns any kind of clashes on the campus. “On January 3, a group of students opposing the registration process entered the Communication and Information Services premises, covering their faces with masks and forcibly evicted the technical staff...This led to the discontinuation of the registration process on January 3,” the statement said.In Video: Shocking!

58,['6/01/2020'],Kolkata: New auto route to link Sinthi and Bagbazar ahead of Tallah closure,"This story is from January 6, 2020

The new route that autos will take

KOLKATA: Nearly 100 autos plying between Sinthi More and Bagbazar Bata will use an alternative route ahead of traffic movement being completely restricted along Tallah Bridge . While the bridge demolition process is likely to be postponed by a few months, the bridge might be completely closed to traffic from the third week of January.

“We are looking forward to a new route to connect Sinthi and Shyambazar after the movement of autos is completely restricted on Tallah Bridge. The auto route was introduced to facilitate movement of the daily commuters from BT Road to Shyambazar,” said Khokon Shil, an office bearer of the auto union at Sinthi.

“At present, we drive along BT Road and cross Tallah Bridge to reach Bagbazar. When the traffic movement is stopped completely, we can take the smaller road by the side of Tallah Bridge to reach the Paikpara area,” said Shil.

The auto union is in talks with the traffic police to finalize the new route. According to sources, the auto services are likely to be stopped in the Paikpara area and commuters will have to take a bus or walk over the Belgachhia bridge to reach Shyambazar. Cops are also looking into the possibility of using smaller roads, like Tara Shankar Sarani, to end auto services near Indra Biswas Road.

The state decided to restrict traffic movement on Tallah Bridge last September and only allowed small vehicles, like autos, to ply on the bridge. Re-routing bus services have led to snarls on the roads leading to the Paikpara intersection and Belgachhia bridge. An auto service between Sinthi More and Shyambazar was started from October to ease the passenger pressure on the buses.

“We are trying to ensure that the autos don’t charge more than Rs 10 after the routes are changed. There is an auto service between Chitpur and BK Paul Avenue. So, the autos on the existing route have to be diverted towards the Paikpara-Belgachhia area,” said Tarun Saha, chairman of KMC borough I.

Meanwhile, bus operators’ unions have asked the transport department to consider the increased cost since the buses have been rerouted.

“We now have to travel at least eight kilometres more,” said Tapan Banerjee, general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicate.

59,['6/01/2020'],Surat: Top realtor booked for kidnapping builder to extort money,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Mahesh Savani

SURAT: Mahesh Savani , a top realtor and owner of many educational institutes in the city, was booked by police at Umra police station for alleged extortion and kidnapping of a builder on Saturday.

The accused, who has attained fame for organizing mass marriages of orphan girls for around a decade, allegedly kidnapped Gautam Patel , 65 , from his house and demanded Rs19 crore for his release.

Police booked Savani, his aide Gopal and four others for extortion and kidnapping under Indian Penal Code on Patel’s complaint. Patel alleged that he was in his house at Parl Point when Gopal and four persons came in a car and asked him to go with them.

Patel refused after which Savani arrived at the spot and forcibly took the complainant in his car to his office in Vesu and demanded Rs19 crore from him. The complainant was also slapped by the accused.

“Savani threatened me that he has contacts at high-level and can put me in trouble if the money was not paid to him. I don’t deny that I had not borrowed money from him but the way he tried to pressurize me is wrong,” said Patel, who recently returned from the US for his son’s marriage.

Patel and his partner Tarun Rawal, a builder who died a few years ago, had borrowed money from Savani in 2009-10. Of the total money borrowed, Patel is supposed to repay Rs3 crore to the accused. “Due to heavy loss in business I couldn’t repay the money in time. Hence I gave 60 per cent share in a plot of land to Savani. He couldn’t recover his money because there is a legal dispute over the land and thus the former is harassing me. I am not running away or denying the unpaid loan,” Patel said.

CCTV footages at the residence of Patel show Savani and other accused taking him along with them. Police will be recovering these footages as a part of their investigation in the case.

Police visited office of Savani where Patel was taken. “The staffers at Savani’s office claim that their recorder was not working properly. We will gather strong evidences before taking action against the accused,” said a police officer at Umra police station.

SURAT: A decision will be taken within this week by a high-powered committee regarding shifting of 40 polluting dyeing and processing units in the city to its outskirts. Owners need at least three lakh square metres of land to shift their units from the city. They want the state government to allot the land in proximity to the industrial clusters around Surat.

There are nearly 375 dyeing and printing units in areas within the limits of Surat Municipal Corporation and near the city. Forty of these units are within the municipal limits and create air pollution that directly affects people living in nearby residential localities like Khatodara and on Sumul Dairy Road.

People for the last two years have been demanding shifting of these units to the outskirts of the city. A plot of land was located for these units behind Sachin GIDC near Soneri village, but it was found unsuitable because of prawn lakes around it. The high-powered committee headed by energy minister Saurabh Patel is expected to find a suitable plot of land for these units within this week, sources said.

Southern Gujarat Textile Processors’ Association president Jitu Vakhriya said, “We are looking for a place where a cluster could be set up for all the units. It must also house a common effluent treatment plant, a community boiler and calibrated water monitoring system. New units in the cluster should be included in continuous emission monitoring system to keep the issue of pollution under check at the outset. We need three lakh square metres of land for housing a cluster of 50 units and creating green zones, building roads and other facilities. The land could be on way towards Umbharat or Bardoli .”

Gujarat governments proposes to dispose of waste directly into the sea through the pipelines. The new cluster should allow this, some unit owners said, adding that their local association will be holding a meeting with the government committee on the new site.

The cold weather makes us crave for mouth-watering junk food. We end up partying more and skip the gym. There’s no end to sampling yummy cakes, spicy pakoras and nolen gurer mishti. Not a single person can actually stick to their diet. Despite all the inner conflict, people end up eating more, which results in weight gain. Now that the festivities are more or less over and the primary concern is to shed those extra kilos, Tollywood celebs are back in the fitness and detox mode. CT spoke to a few actors to know what they are doing to get back in shape. Read on...Everyone knows how disciplined I am when it comes to fitness and health. However, in the festive season, I had several cheat days, missed my workouts and compromised on my diet. Now, I am back to my daily routine. I don’t follow a fixed fitness regimen, as everything depends on my work schedule. At present, I am doing cardio, weight training and freehand on a regular basis to shed those extra inches. Twenty minutes of pranayama is a must for me. I have seven to eight meals a day. I eat a lot of sprouts or almonds, fruits, dates, egg whites, 200 grams of chicken or fish, boiledor tossed in olive oil.After the festive season, you need enough motivation to get back to your regular fitness regime. I started working out from January 1. I am mainly focusing on cardio — especially kickboxing, high-intensity intermittent workouts (HIIT) and toning exercises. Plus, I do pranayama because it helps stretch your muscles. Rice, fried food, refined flour and sweets are completely off the menu. I’m only having homemade food in right measures at the right time.In the past one month, I attended several lunch and dinner parties for Christmas and New Year. I literally survived on biryani, bharta and desserts! Obviously, I put on weight. So now, I have joined aerobic classes. Hitting the gym is somethingI don’t like. I find it boring. There is a rhythm in aerobics and I enjoy that. I started having whole, unprocessed food and fruits. I am not even looking at fried food and sweets. I start my day with warm water with a hint of lime juice and apple cider vinegar. Drinking water before meals also helps control my appetite.The party season is finally over and it is time for some action. To recover what I have lost, or actually gained, I have begun the year with strict intermittent fasting of 14 hours. This definitely creates a shortage in all the excess calorie intake and burns whatever fat the body is already storing. Also, training wise, I have started running. It helps keep the face lean along with the rest of the body. Cycling in this weather is just perfect. I am going a little easy on weight training since I need to look lean for my next project. I am focusing more on HIIT to be faster, stronger and leaner. No outside food, carbs or sweets for me till I shed those extra kilos. I am having loads of vegetable with chicken stew, curd, salads and fruits. Drinking water adequately is also important to stay fit.I hate the word, diet, as I have developed a sensible eating habit with time. There are three phases in a year, where I eat everything. Christmas and New Year is one such phase. From plum cakes to nolen gurer rosogolla, pithey to biryani, I have it all. But I eat in moderation, as I know how much I can burn. Now, I am totally in a detox mode. I have started running for half an hour, followed by calisthenics and resistance training. Yoga is a must for any actor, as it makes one flexible. For breakfast, I have fruits, egg and milk. Lunch is 150 grams of rice, dal, fish curry and doi. Dinner is chicken stew and one roti. I am avoiding outside food, junk food or sweets till the Bengali New Year.I have stopped weighing myself for the time being. I will do that only after a month of working out. I have started hitting the gym and doing yoga religiously from January 1. I am doing cardio and weightlifting to shed those extra kilos and get toned.I am also doing yoga and meditation to concentrate better. That apart, I am on a no-carb diet, with just one tablespoon of rice at night. I am drinking loads of water and eating after regular intervals. Dinner is by 7.30-8 pm and it is mainly soup and boiled vegetables. I am also having a lot of seasonal fruits.Hydration is important to get back in shape. Drink as many glasses of water as possible as it helps you detox properlyEat at two-hour intervals. Cut down the proportion of food. Avoid junk food, beverages and sweetsNormalise your routine. Eat your dinner post sunset, preferably by 7 pm. Avoid carbs at night and stay away from phone before hitting the bed.

Cardio helps you lose weightStrength/ weight training is important for getting back in shapeCardio is important after a break. Floor, machine, circuit and cross fit cardios help you lose fat easilyWeight training is also a good way to get back in shape.For the chest, I suggest flat bench presses.

Varanasi: Kicking off BJP’s campaign to clear confusions regarding CAA in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency on Sunday, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan questioned Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to clear whether her party is with Pakistan or India.

Pradhan alleged frustrated by their defeats in Lok Sabha election, forces like Congress, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Aam Adami Party are fanning anarchy in the country in the name of anti-CAA protests. Talking to reporters before starting his door-to-door campaign, Pradhan reacted over Sonia Gandhi’s statement that India should increase pressure on Pakistan after Nankana Sahib incident and said: where was she till now? What did she do on the irresponsible attitude adopted by her party over CAA in past 15 days? First of all she should clear whether her party is with Pakistan.”

Regarding his Varanasi visit, he said that some mischievous elements and frustrated political parties like Congress, TMC, SP and AAP tried to fan anarchy in the country with false propaganda against CAA. In CAA, he said, the government has ensured provision to give citizenship to six minorities of three neighbouring countries only. The citizenship of any countryman is not going to be affected by it, he said adding, but the people were misled on the issue.

To counter the same bid of opposition parties BJP has launched a month-long countrywide awareness campaign, he said adding, to begin the same campaign he was in Kashi. He said that during the month-long campaign party will go door-to-door, hold seminars and discussion to make the people aware about truth of CAA.

Later, Pradhan started door-to-door campaign by visiting the houses of a lawyer Rajesh Kumar Mishra near police lines and later reached the home of international basketball player Vibhor Raghuvanshi and Pradeep Sonekar in Bhuvaneshwar Nagar and Gautam Vihar colonies. Following interaction with people gathered there he also distributed handbills containing details on CAA.

Pradhan held the attack on Nankana Sahib Gurudwara as a live example of injustice being committed to minorities in Pakistan and alleged that just for their vote bank politics the parties like Congress and SP were misleading some sections of society by propagating false facts regarding CAA.

63,['6/01/2020'],"In a first, dist’s Cong, NCP ministers get good portfolios","This story is from January 6, 2020

Nagpur: For the first time Congress and NCP ministers from the district, at least two of the three, have got good portfolios in the state government. Earlier, they used to get less important departments. Still, compared to the last BJP-Shiv Sena government, the district has got less importance.

Anil Deshmukh, NCP MLA from Katol, has got home. Nitin Raut, Congress MLA from Nagpur North, has got energy while Sunil Kedar, Congress MLA from Saoner, has got dairy development. During BJP rule, Devendra Fadnavis was the chief minister with urban development and home portfolios and Chandrashekhar Bawankule had got energy and excise. In the last five months of previous government’s tenure, MLC Parinay Fuke was minister of state, albeit from Bhandara quota.

Thus, though there are three cabinet ministers from the district, Nagpur has three portfolios instead of four in the previous government.

A senior Congress leader admitted that Congress and NCP ministers from the district had got good portfolios for the first time. “The two parties had to do a balancing act lest they be charged with anti-Vidarbha bias,” he said.

Deshmukh has always got good portfolios but the Congress cabinet ministers always got less important ones. Ranjit Deshmukh and Satish Chaturvedi were textile ministers while Anees Ahmed was dairy development minister in the last Congress governments. Many decades ago Sheshrao Wankhede was the finance minister.

Between 1995 and 1999, when BJP and Shiv Sena were in power, the district had two cabinet ministers and two ministers of state. Nitin Gadkari was public works minister, Anil Deshmukh was school education minister while Vinod Gudadhe and Sunil Kedar were MoSs.

City BJP president Pravin Datke said that the portfolios this time were better as compared to past but he was doubtful whether these ministers would be allowed to work independently. “I congratulate the three and urged them to work for development of the district and Vidarbha,” he said.

NCP district president Shivraj ‘Baba’ Gujar said that Anil Deshmukh getting is was very important. “I hope NCP spreads its wings in Vidarbha using this,” he added.

NCP city president Anil Ahirkar said that portfolios were not that important. “A minister with even a minor portfolios can work hard and do a good job. What the minister achieves during his tenure is important,” he said.

Nagpur city’s crime rate was high during Fadnavis’s tenure as home minister. Deshmukh would now have to reduce it unless he too wants to get the flak.

Bawankule had decided to install two new 660MW units at Koradi power plant. Citizens can only hope that Raut overrules the decision and gives respite to them from pollution.

PATNA: The poster war between RJD and JD(U) has intensified with Lalu Prasad-led party putting up fresh posters on Sunday. In one of the posters, the RJD described the CM Nitish Kumar as a “power hungry” politician.

The RJD also placed an image of Lalu on the left side of the poster describing him ‘janta ka sarthi (chariot of people)’. On the right side, there is an image of Nitish showing him ‘kursi ka lalchi (power hungry)’. The posters were put up in front of the Beerchand Patel Marg office of RJD.

The RJD also took a potshot at Nitish for his alleged failure to check crime in the state. In a fresh tweet, Lalu has described Nitish as ‘girgitia (chameleon)’ and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi as ‘khitpitia (quarrelsome)’. “Ek girgitia toh dusra jhitpitia, kul mila ke shasan ghatia,” Lalu tweeted.

Lalu’s wife and former CM Rabri Devi didn’t lag behind in attacking Nitish and his deputy. She tweeted on Sunday, “Wo nafrat failate hain, hum pyar. Wo alag karte hain, hum saath late hain (While they spread hatred, we spread love. They alienate, we bring people together).”

The poster war began on January 2 with the JD(U) releasing posters of the party displaying its performance during the 15-year regime of its government in the state since 2005. The posters also projected the “dark eras” of RJD government in the state from 1990 to 2005 while highlights the “good works” of Nitish government afterwards.

The contrast “success” story of the JD(U) government and “failure” of the RJD attracted sharp reactions from the main opposition party in the state. To counter the attack of the JD(U), the RJD also released its posters portraying Nitish and Sushil Kumar Modi carrying buckets of lies and hollow promises, just to mislead the people.

The posters released by the RJD were put up in front of the party office and other locations in the state capital. Political observers feel that the poster war would gain momentum in the days to come as assembly elections will be held in the state in October-November.

KOLKATA: Capsule water booster pumping stations have become Kolkata Municipal Corporation ’s answer to water scarcity and elimination of groundwater usage in large parts of the city. Unable to find appropriate land for construction of large booster pumping stations in areas where citizens have been facing acute water crisis, the KMC top brass decided to lap up small plots to construct miniscule pumping stations.

In 2018, the water supply department selected a small plot — three cottahs — near Behala Flying Club to build a small booster pumping station. This station, which started operations last year, turned out to be the first capsule booster pumping station in the city. Going by its success, the civic administration started a hunt for such small plots and succeeded in finding 15 of them which were used to set up capsule booster pumping stations to supply potable water from the Garden Reach, Wattgunge and Dhapa treatment plants.

These small plots, measuring between 2.5 cottahs and 4 cottahs, were mainly required for busy areas where citizens either faced acute water shortage or were forced to drink groundwater in absence of filtered water. With the passage of time, such capsule booster pumping stations became popular as they could solve the crisis without taking up huge plots of land.

According to a water supply department official, after construction of 15 capsule water booster pumping stations, the civic body has come to a position where potable water is being supplied to around one million people who would drink groundwater or had been suffering from acute water scarcity. Some of the areas where the capsule water pumping stations have come up in the past two years include Garden Reach, Kidderpore, Behala, Kalighat, Tollygunge, Jadavpur and areas located off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.

However, a KMC official pointed out that the job of supplying filtered water to citizens from treatment plants was yet to be complete. “We are on a mission of augmenting filtered water supply to cater to growing needs — especially in areas where housing complexes are coming up. In the second phase, we need to set up 13 capsule booster pumping stations by the next year to take care the increasing need for filtered water. We have identified small plots in the added areas and construction is going on for 10 such stations. We hope to wind up the construction by early 2021,” said a water supply department official.

After assuming office, mayor Firhad Hakim had asked the civic top brass to concentrate on setting up booster pumping stations as chief minister Mamata Banerjee had instructed him to ensure that citizens in large areas of Jadavpur, Behala, Tollygunge and EM Bypass could have access to safe drinking water.

KOCHI: Expensive fish varieties tend to remain stable in terms of value, while species at the lower end of the commercial scale tend to fluctuate more, according to a study of fish prices in the Ernakulam market.The study found very low fluctuation in the price behaviour of seer fish and prawn when compared with sardine, mackerel and anchovy. The study was carried out by the socio-economic evaluation and technology transfer division of the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) on the price stability of commercially traded fish in two major retail markets — Thevara and Broadway.“We found that the choice of fish available in Ernakulam is much better than in other cities of Kerala. The low-value species, which are more popular, show greater price instability in the retail markets,” said Shyam S Salim, principal scientist, CMFRI.There is a fixed stock of high-value fish hitting the markets that is bought by a confirmed clientele. Hence, their prices do not fluctuate much. However, in case of low-value fish like sardine and mackerel, the stock comes from different sellers and are brought by different customers. That’s why demand/supply comes into play and hence the price instability,” said Salim.The study, which was released recently, also revealed that prices are independent of landings. The Ernakulam market is flooded with stock from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and even further north. It found that average fish consumption in Ernakulam was 9.34kg per family per month — of which 68% was low-value and 32% high-value fish.One of the major findings was regarding the independence of retail prices from fish landings. The inter-district as well as inter-state import of fish was meant to iron up demand in a centre like Ernakulam and this is the major reason for the weak relationship between landings and retail centre price.Major species in the retail market include sardine, mackerel, threadfin bream, seer fish, prawn, crab, pomfret, tuna, cod, mullet, surgeon fish, barramundi, squid, anchovy, red snapper and rohu.Based on calculations over the 2014-16 period, researchers found the price of seer fish averaged Rs 335 per kg, with value ranging from Rs 270 to Rs 500, whereas the average price of prawn was pegged at Rs 386/kg, on a Rs 300 and Rs 500 range.Among the low-value fish, sardine averaged Rs 107, with price ranging from Rs 63 and Rs 150 while mackerel was Rs 141/kg, at Rs 90 to Rs 200. Anchovy had a mean price of Rs 141, and Rs 90 to Rs 200 range.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73120273,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-600920,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/in-terms-of-price-seer-fish-prawn-have-little-wiggle-room/articleshow/73113448.cms

Ticket checker Umesh Bedi who was attacked by miscreants at Gittikhadan on Saturday night

Nagpur: An Aapli Bus ticket checker was attacked by two-three masked miscreants shortly after he made a surprise check at a bus in Gittikhadan area on Saturday night. According to senior officials of Aapli Bus programme manager Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS), the goons might have acted on being informed by the bus conductor about the surprise check.

“Several conductors who are defrauding the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) have hired goons to prevent ticket checkers from keeping vigil. Around 15 ticket checkers have been attacked in the last 11 months,” said Hemant Kawle, operation manager of DIMTS.

In December last year, TOI had reported how corrupt conductors of Aapli buses, in connivance with sacked checkers and goons, were allegedly attacking ticket checkers.

Kawle said they will find out who was on the duty on the bus which was checked by our ticket checker. “The conductor must have tipped off the goons about the checking. Every time our checkers are on duty, some people follow them and stop them from taking action. The attacks have left the ticket terrified, thus causing revenue to the NMC,” said Kawle.

On Saturday night, ticket checker Umesh Bedi, 43, and his team intercepted an Aapli bus. After checking details of passengers and fare collected, Bedi came out of the bus and went to his car in which his two colleagues were sitting.

Bedi was in the car when two-to-three masked persons approached him and started thrashing him. When his colleagues tried to intervene, the accused fled the spot.

Bedi filed complaint at Gittikhadan police station. After Bedi under went a medical check-up, cops registered a non-cognizable offence against the attackers.

“Gittikhadan is one of those areas from where the Aapli bus revenue is very poor, so checking drive is going on there. Bedi has lost the note on which registration number of the bus was mentioned. Still, we will track down the bus as he remembers face of the conductor. Action will be taken if the conductor is at fault,” said Kawle.

Saligao: Bearing the brunt of garbage being dumped from neighbouring villages, Mapusa municipal council (MMC) has appealed to the panchayats in the vicinity of the town to begin waste collection in their localities.

The municipality recently commenced a drive to curb garbage dumping within its jurisdiction, and has collected Rs 19,200 in fines after penalising over 40 offenders. MMC also instructed market inspectors to be strict on garbage dumping.

Chief officer Clen Madeira told reporters that residents of neighbouring villages were found dumping their garbage within the municipality’s jurisdiction.

“As some of the neighbouring villages don’t have a proper mechanism for garbage, people dispose their waste in Mapusa,” said Madeira.

“We are collecting fees from Mapusa residents. We cannot tax our people for the garbage being dumped by those from other villages. The municipality would like to request neighbouring panchayats to start collecting garbage from their villages,” he added.

NAGPUR: Kidneys, liver and eyes of a 75-year-old city woman were donated to needy patients after she was declared brain-dead on January 5. Family members of Vimal Prashad Shrivas, a resident of Gulmohar Nagar, Bharatwada Road, said that it was her wish to save someone’s life by donating organs after her death.

This was the first organ donation activity of this year coordinated by the Zonal Transplant coordination centre (ZTCC), Nagpur. At 75, Shrivas, who saved three lives, was the oldest brainstem dead donor under ZTCC Nagpur so far.

“A homemaker and mother of seven, Shrivas was not well from December 18. She was admitted at New Era hospital on January 1. She was operated for massive intracerebral bleed. Despite all the treatment, her condition deteriorated and team of doctors declared her brain-dead,” said Dr Sanjay Kolatey, secretary of ZTCC Nagpur.

As other parameters of the patient were fine, the family was counselled by Dr Nilesh Agrawal for organ donation. Her son Onkar, who works in a local television channel, and daughter Maya Nimpure, a teacher, said their mother wished to donate organs. The entire family readily agreed to donate the deceased’s kidneys, liver and a pair of corneas to fulfil her last wish.

“Age old patients are considered as marginal donors. As the donar’s kidneys were old, nephrologists decided to implant both kidneys to one needy patient to ensure better results. Both the kidneys were transplanted on a 44-year-old male patient. Liver was donated to a 56-year-old male patient,” said zone coordinator of ZTCC Veena Vathore.

Kidney and liver transplant was carried out at the same hospital where the donor was declared brain-dead. Under the guidance of Dr Anand Sancheti and Dr Nidhish Mishra, a team of Dr Shivnarayan Acharya, Dr Ravi Deshmukh, Dr Rohit Gupta , Dr Amit Deshpande , Dr Amol Kokas and transplant coordinator Dr Ashwini Choudhri conducted the kidney transplant. Liver retrieval and transplant was conducted by Dr Rahul Saxena, Dr Sahil Bansal and Dr Sushant Gulhane. New Era staff created honour corridor to salute the donor. The hospital also provided the ambulance service free of cost to send the body to donor’s home. The pair of corneas was donated to Mahatme Eye Bank.

SECUNDERABAD: It was the ability to be brave in the face of danger that helped Brigadier Henry Bhasker contribute effectively to India’s victory over Pakistan in 1965. At the Chamb-Jaurian sector, the Indian Army came face to face with the Pakistan army. Bhasker noticed a Pakistan soldier advancing towards him. He aimed his gun straight at the man and pumped bullets into his body.

“I did not even look back to see what had happened to him. The situation demanded that we surge ahead and drive the Pakistani army away,” Bhasker recalled in a conversation with TOI at his home in Secunderabad . After having pushed back the Pakistan army, a group of Pakistani soldiers came waving a white flag to indicate that they came in peace and to retrieve the body of a Pakistan major who had been killed.

Bhasker who was freshly inducted into the Indian Army did not realise that he had felled a Pakistan Army major. The man shot dead was Major Rizvi, a decorated officer of the Pakistan army and a well-known relative of a Pakistan army general. “To me, he was an enemy and he had to be vanquished,” Bhasker recalled.

Bhasker had been commissioned into the Mahar regiment after his training at IMA had the unique distinction of raising a battalion when he was just 19. Speaking about his involvement in the Indo-Pak war in 1971, he recalled when three men from Pakistan army pounced on him. Bhasker overpowered them, and took cover in an old structure. The Pakistani soon began a search operation for him. “I did not want to give them any chance to take me captive,” Bhasker recalled. “I made up my mind to rush back to my battalion. But the danger was that I could be caught in the crossfire between both armies and be killed probably by the Indian army itself,” he said. It took tact and courage, and Bhasker made his way out of the situation.

At the time, there was also heavy action at Chittagong. East Pakistan was fighting to liberate itself to become Bangladesh and India was at war with Pakistan. The Indian Army surged ahead and Bhasker reached the Chittagong Port and held the fort. “Riots broke out and we had to protect the civilian population,” he recollected adding that the effort needed more sensitivity.

“If you join the Army, you will die,” his mother Lily had told him when he revealed his decision to join the armed forces when he was a teen. That did not scare him. They realised he was obstinate and had resolved to don the uniform for the country and thereafter encouraged him to pursue his ambition.

The 79-year-old is a content man, having served the Army for 32 years. His son followed in his footsteps and was also commissioned in the Mahar regiment of the Indian Army. Brig Henry Bhasker said that he was proud of his son Col Vinod Bhasker, who himself has proved to be as valorous as his father.

Kozhikode: Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama has suspended Nazar Faizy Koodathayi, state joint secretary of Sunni Yuvajana Sangham ( SYS ), from all posts he is holding in the feeder organizations under the Samastha.

Though the press release from Samastha has not cited any particular reason for the action, it is learnt that the organization is angry over Faizy posing for a photo with BJP leaders when they reached his house as part of campaign in favour of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on Sunday.

Samastha decided to take action against Faizy after the photo went viral on social media. Many people, including those within the organization, came down heavily on Faizy for posing for the photo “when large sections in the country were agitating against the Act”. Some asked Faizy to show at least the political wisdom displayed by the two girls in Delhi who shouted slogans against Union home minister Amit Shah.

In his Facebook post, Faizy apologized to “secular India” and to all his well-wishers for the “lack of alertness” on his part.

“Some BJP leaders and workers came to my house on Sunday to discuss CAA and NRC. I had clearly stated my position during the arguments. When the discussions were over, they gave me a pamphlet and took a photograph,” Faizy wrote in a Facebook post.

“I should have refused the photo session and I am not justifying the lack of alertness on my part. I realise that my act has caused embarrassment to my organization and my friends. I sincerely apologise for the mistake,” Faizy said, adding that he will remain at the forefront of the anti-CAA agitation.

Varanasi: Amid escalating tension between US and Iran, India is making all possible efforts to keep fuel prices under control. This was stated by Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan during a brief chat with reporters after offering prayers at Kashi Vishwanath temple here on Sunday.

Pradhan said turmoil in oil production zones impacts price of crude. He said: “India is already working on the lines of arranging crude oil from other parts of the world, including undisturbed Gulf countries and other oil producing zones.”

Besides, long, mid and short-term efforts were also being made to reduce dependence on petroleum and explore alternative energy sources. He said these efforts were being made because any disturbance in oil producing zones directly impacts Indian petroleum products and oil markets.

Pradhan said: “India has cleared its stand on the emerging situation in Gulf due to escalating tension between the US and Iran.”

He said India hopes for no further escalation of tension between two countries in the interest of world and country. Regarding safety of Indians and Indian-origin people in Gulf countries, he said there was no need to worry as in other parts of Gulf, including Saudi Arab and UAE the situation is peaceful.

Pillion riders had long batons/staffs in their hands

On Sunday evening, my sister, a student at Jawaharlal Nehru University, called me in panic over violence in the campus. When I reached near the university around 9pm, I found the turn from Munirka going towards the JNU main gate barricaded. However, the carriageway leading away from JNU was open.

When I reached the main gate, I saw a couple of two-wheelers pulling up at the traffic signal. The pillion riders had long batons/staffs in their hands. The road leading to JNU was in total darkness. The students who frequently use the road confirmed that it is usually lit up at night.

There were ambulances and police at the gates of a housing complex across the road. Police officers were telling people to stay inside. The gate had been blocked as there was sloganeering happening in front of it.

My sister, a first-year MPhil student who stays in Ganga hostel, called me to say that she was opposite the gate. I had just hung up the call and crossed the road when I saw some shoving and pushing at the door of an ambulance.

As I went to look, I also dialled my sister. At that moment, a man in his 30s snatched my phone to check the screen. He then let go of the phone and joined the group jostling at the ambulance door. When my sister answered, she said she had run in the direction of Vasant Kunj/Nelson Mandela Marg because some people with sticks had chased her.

When I finally located her, she said some men had snatched her phone too. One man, who was hitting the ground with his stick, and his companion asked whom she was talking to. When she told them she was talking to her mother, they told her, “Ghar jaakar maa se baat karo.” My sister ran from there and took shelter a distance away, where I found her.

77,['6/01/2020'],Nitin Gadkari spearheads BJP’s outreach mission to Muslims,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Nitin Gadkari

NAGPUR: Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday started BJP’s campaign to reach out to the Muslim community members and allay their concerns over Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Along with Rajya Sabha MP from Chhattisgarh Saroj Pandey and prominent local party leaders, Gadkari visited three Muslim families in Mohan Nagar and Byramji Town and tried to assure them that the Act in no way threatens their citizenship status.

At the residence of businessman Israel Seth Shaikh in Byramji Town, Gadkari met a gathering of prominent Muslim community members who sought answers on various aspects of CAA. Gadkari said, “Vested political interests have led to wrong information being spread about CAA. The opposition parties want you (Muslims) to be scared because it will benefit their vote bank. I can assure you that neither BJP nor RSS is anti-Muslim.”

Well-known lawyer Firdos Mirza told Gadkari that the possibility of millions of Muslims becoming “stateless” just because they are unable to prove their citizenship is a big concern. “In Assam, you have lakhs of Muslims who are struggling to prove their citizenship. They have become stateless,” said Mirza. He went on to add that in case of Muslim reservation, it was denied saying the Constitution does not allow for discrimination on the basis of religion. “If that’s the case, then how on the basis of religion a particular community is being excluded from the law’s ambit. This too goes against the Constitution,” he said. A letter highlighting their concerns was handed over to Gadkari at the meeting.

Senior academician Zafar Khan, who was present during Gadkari’s visit in Mohan Nagar area, said they are still awaiting clarity on documents required to prove citizenship. “There are talks about birth certificate being mandatory to establish citizenship, at least in Assam. But majority of people born in 1970s and before that don’t have birth certificates as not much awareness was there about it. Many were born at their homes with the delivery being facilitated by midwives,” said Khan.

Mohd Farooq, coordinator of Muslim Rashtriya Manch and one of the organizers of Gadkari’s visit to these families, feels presence of big leaders will make a difference. “We want to clear the air about CAA and NRC and put everyone’s mind at ease. When top leadership reaches out directly to people, it has a greater effect. I feel the CAA issue has been blown out of proportion by some people,” said Farooq.

MP Saroj Pande, who came specifically for this campaign from Chhattisgarh, said, “CAA gives citizenship and does not take it away. We want to assure every Indian Muslim that there is nothing to fear from this, and we are confident that our outreach campaign will achieve that purpose.”

Former mayor Pravin Datke said the community visits will continue every week. “In the first list itself, we have over 250 families (for visit), and our entire leadership will continue to participate in this. Right from Gadkari, to Devendra Fadnavis to the local leaders, we will go all out to convince every community member that CAA is not anti-Muslim,” said Datke.

“Such brutal attacks against students had not taken place even during British rule when campuses were the hotbed of anti-colonial agitations. The attack on JNU students show to what extent the fascist forces would go to tighten their grip over the country. Goons even entered the ladies hostel and attacked students. The campuses in the state should strongly protest against the attack in the streets. If we remain silent the attacks would spread to other institutions across the country and would spur further attacks,” Jaleel said on the sidelines of the chief minister’s student leaders conclave held at Farook College on Monday.TNN

79,['6/01/2020'],Paper assessment will be under CCTV surveillance: Bamu,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Aurangabad: Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu) has decided to conduct assessment of answer-sheets under camera surveillance.

The move, which is first-of-its-kind reform by any state university, aims to reduce the scope for any unethical practices during the assessment work.

Speaking with TOI, Bamu vice-chancellor Pramod Yeole stressed on the need for restoring the credibility of students and other stakeholders in the assessment of answer-sheets.

“Examination is one of the crucial aspects of the education system and its evaluation process must be utmost fair. Arrangements are being made to carry out the assessment work under the surveillance of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras. The measure will ensure accountability in the assessment process, which is missing to some extent in the existing procedure,” he said.

Elaborating further, the VC said a time-log of assessment carried out by the evaluators would be also maintained.

“A time-log of each evaluator teacher will be maintained using CCTV cameras. It will help in arriving at the average and particular time spent by every evaluator in the assessment work. Any marked deviation in the expected time-log will be subjected to investigation,” Yeole said.

Bamu, with jurisdiction over Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed and Osmanabad districts, is considered one of the oldest universities in Maharashtra having over 410 affiliated colleges. The university has student strength of over 4.5 lakh.

A senior Bamu official said the university in past had received serious complaints related to assessment work which prompted the university administration to increase vigil during evaluation of answer-sheets.

“We came across complaints such as evaluators not carrying out the assessment work at authorised centres and taking the answer-sheets home. Issues related to the alleged poor or arbitrary assessment were also rampant. Increasing surveillance could be the cure for such glaring issues,” he said.

K Abdullah

MADURAI/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: K Abdullah (born Subramani), 51, was in his early teens when he left Puliyankudi near Kadayanallur in Tenkasi district and arrived at Kadakkal in Kollam district in Kerala to earn a living. A Class I dropout, all he could do was help out in a snack shop. Through hard work and sheer perseverance over the years, Abdullah rose in life and went on set up a chain of wholesale grocery stores.

Thirty-five years on, Abdullah is paying back to the society that made him what he is now. He has purchased a 1-acre plot, which is now worth Rs 1 crore, where 87 houses will be built for homeless families in Kadakkal panchayat under the Kerala government’s Mission LIFE (Livelihood Inclusion and Financial Empowerment), which envisages a comprehensive housing scheme for all landless and homeless people in the state. Documents for the land parcel will be handed over to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan next week.

Abdullah spent his early years making and selling snacks. Later, he bought a push cart and started selling snacks on his own. The business slowly prospered and Abdullah bought five shops. A few years ago, he transferred four of his shops to people who worked for him, at a nominal price.

“Abdullah used to be in the forefront when it comes to charity. He used to help a home for the differently abled in a nearby village by providing them food and basic needs,” Biju, Kadakkal panchayat president, told TOI.

“It's not about having money, it's about how you spend it. If your money could be useful to those who really need it, then your assets become meaningful. I had spent countless nights under a leaking roof in my house. My circumstances did not let me study further and I had to start working at a very young age,” said Abdullah.

“One cannot help all the people around him, but certainly one can help at least a few people to alleviate their sufferings,” said Abdullah, whose family fully supports his philanthropic activities. Abdullah’s parents Karupaiah and Muthammal, who still live in his native place, had named him Subramani. He changed his name to Abdullah after he embraced Islam in 2001. He has two children – Sabija, who is married, and Mohammed, who is a pharmacy graduate. “I’ve had business transactions with some people in local villages for more than 20 years. They have helped me in many ways to come up in life,” he said.

Biju said there are 127 homeless people in the panchayat, of which 87 will get houses in multi-storeyed buildings to be constructed in the plot under Mission LIFE. Abdullah’s gesture has come at a time when the mission was finding it hard to find land and close a bargain for land deals due to soaring prices. “I never think I lose something when I spend money for others, I actually feel richer,”' says Abdullah.

Union home minister Amit Shah

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday ordered an inquiry into violence on JNU campus by a senior Delhi Police official and asked for the report to be submitted as soon as possible.

Shah spoke to Delhi police commissioner Amulya Patnaik to take stock of the violence that broke out on JNU campus on Sunday evening. He instructed Patnaik to take necessary action to bring the situation under control.

The home minister's office tweeted, “Union Home minister has spoken to Delhi police commissioner over JNU violence and instructed him to take necessary action. The noble minister has also ordered an inquiry to be carried out by a joint CP-level officer and asked for a report as soon as possible.”

BJP condemned the violence in JNU, seeking a probe into the role of the “tukde, tukde” gang. In a tweet, the party said: We strongly condemn the violence on JNU campus. This is a desperate attempt by forces of anarchy, who are determined to use students as cannon fodder, to create unrest to shore up their shrinking political footprint. Universities should remain places of learning and education.”

Senior BJP leader and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, a JNU alumnus, described the violence as “horrifying” and asserted that the Modi government wants universities to be safe spaces for all students. “Horrifying images from JNU - the place I know & remember was one for fierce debates & opinions but never violence. I unequivocally condemn the events of today. This govt, regardless of what has been said the past few weeks, wants universities to be safe spaces for all students,” she tweeted.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, also a JNU alumnus, tweeted, “Have seen pictures of what is happening in #JNU. Condemn the violence unequivocally. This is completely against the tradition and culture of the university.”

BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said violence in any form needs to be condemned but added that it is equally important to note that a certain group of people in JNU subscribe to a “mindset that calls for dismemberment of India and considers death sentence of a known terrorist by the Supreme Court to be an act of murder”.

These people are often called “tukde tukde” gang, he said, and added, “obviously their ideology can't be one of peace. It must be ascertained as to what is their specific role in this culture of violence, especially in this specific incident today.”

Villagers display a skeleton as a mark of protest against the three capital cities proposal at Velagapudi in G... Read More

VIJAYAWADA: The silence of the film industry on protests surrounding the three capital cities proposal in Amaravati has drawn criticism from farmers in the capital region.

The protesters, who have sought the support of various sections to retain the capital at Amaravati, have demanded that the film industry extend its support to the cause, failing which they will boycott films slated to release this Sankranti.

Locals have also condemned actor and former minister of state Chiranjeevi’s support for the proposal. The actor had said he supported the idea of three capitals for Andhra Pradesh but requested the state government to ensure justice for farmers of Amaravati.

The film industry, however, has cause for concern as Sankranti is the most important season for Telugu film releases.

The Amaravati joint action committee (JAC) also called on the film industry to support the protests. “It is time the Telugu film industry shows solidarity to farmers who have lost their livelihoods. Actors and filmmakers who show appreciation for farmers on screen should come out on the streets of Amaravati and support those deceived by the YSR Congress government in the name of decentralisation,” said Sunkara Padmasri, AP Congress vice-president at a programme held by the Amaravati JAC.

“The Telugu film industry should respond to our problems. Krishna and Guntur districts are prime markets for Telugu cinema but the industry has turned a blind eye to our problems. We will boycott new films if they continue to ignore the issue,” said M Aditya, a farmer in Mandadam.

The protests, which entered the 19th day on Sunday, have gathered steam from the participation of farmers in the 29 villages in the capital region.

Farmers who had given their land to the state government under the land pooling scheme have also been joined by trade associations, advocates and realtors, in protest against the government’s proposal.

NEW DELHI: Armed with chalks and pens, 100-odd men and women gathered at Connaught Place on Sunday afternoon. They were there to write ‘secular India’ on the pavements, as a part of their protest against Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens .However, along with them, assembled a bigger crowd of hecklers, who removed the chalk graffiti in real time with their feet and water. The peaceful protest was, quite literally, swept away by their sheer number. The latter group said they had a problem with ‘India’ being written on the ground. “This is unacceptable. ‘India’ ko hatao… mitao,” said one of them. Vikas Chaturvedi, 29, said: “(Prime Minister) Modi is doing these things (introduction of the new law) for the welfare of the country. People who are burning buses are wrong. These protests make no sense. India’s written here, you will step on it. How will you feel if you had your parents’ or family names written on the ground?”Filmmaker Saba Dewan, one of the organisers of the anti-CAA protest under the aegis of Collective Performative Action, earlier said their idea was to reclaim the idea of secular India. “We want to fill the pavements of Connaught Place with chalk writings that reassert the promises made to us by the Constitution. No slogans, no speeches. There is nothing to object. It is extremely peaceful and non-violent. Writing ‘secular India’ can hardly be termed offensive,” Dewan said.But within half an hour, a crowd gathered and the heckling started. “What kind of patriotism is this? Remove ‘India’,” said one among them. Others went ahead and rubbed the words off using their feet.A few of the agitators started working again on adding “India” with its secular prefix at one corner near Gate No. 1 of Palika Bazar. A paramilitary jawan came and mildly asked them not to write ‘India’.The to-and-fro continued through the afternoon. Police and security personnel kept a close vigil. According to police, two men and a woman were detained, but later released.After nearly 90 minutes of writing and rewriting, one NDMC safai karamchari came and swept the chalk graffiti. A bit later, came a man with a wet sweeper and made the cemented pavement clean and new. An elderly gentleman, who was overseeing the safai, made sure not a chalk stain remained on the dusty CP pavement.And the day ended with slogans of “inquilab zindabad” and “Jai Shri Ram”.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73115006,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-749331,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chalk-cheese-when-ideas-of-india-collide/articleshow/73114118.cms

Panaji: Digging work by various agencies on nine roads in the capital city has been completed, paving the way for these stretches to be hotmixed.

“PWD already issued the work order. We will hold a meeting with PWD engineers, and after inspecting the roads, the hotmixing work will begin,” Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) mayor Uday Madkaikar told TOI.

The roads were being dug up to lay power cables underground, water pipelines and natural gas pipes. CCP will not permit any digging of the roads once hotmixed, he added.

“We had requested the agencies to complete the digging work on these nine roads by December 31. After asking for extra time till January 2, they have now told us that the digging work has been completed. We have held multiple meetings with digging agencies and informed them that we will not permit any digging on the roads once hotmixed for a minimum of three years,” Madkaikar added.

The roads where digging work has been completed and which will be hotmixed are the stretch in front of the CCP office, part of A B road from Junta House to Wisdom book house (right side reinstated portion), part of D V road from Mahalaxmi temple to Menino residency, road leading to Mhal wado Altinho, road from Mario Fernandes to Wilma Dias’ house at Mala, National Theatre Road, road up to Cafe Real junction, road opposite Poshak from Thomas Cook up to diamond junction and the market road from Dempo House up to the underground parking.

Estimates are being prepared for hotmixing of other stretches in Panaji.

Chennai: School students have come up with some innovative solutions such as using rice stubble for laying roads, producing electricity from the heat generated by electronic devices and storing excess flood water in underground tanks at IIT Madras.

Totally, 19 teams made presentations suggesting solutions for air pollution, traffic management, sustainable use of water and agriculture and storage of grains at the finals of Shaastra’s Spark Junior Conference on Sunday.

Yash Sharma and Amritanshu Jha from Delhi won the first prize for developing Heat Management System (HMS) – Jugaad Approach which can generate electricity of up to 11 volts from the heat emitted by electronic devices such as refrigerator and microwave oven.

They also came up with an idea to purify smoke emitted by chimneys and vehicles through chemical separation. The device is called Smoke Controller And Recycler (SCAR).“If we develop the device and fit into vehicles, it would reduce the vehicle emission. By using low-cost devices like HMS, we can reduce our dependency on coal and petroleum for energy. Using alternative energy can prevent air pollution,” Sharma said.

Saishyam R and Gowri Krishnan M, both Class X students from Thiruvananthapuram, came up with a novel idea to convert rice stubble into pellets and using them to lay roads to avoid stubble burning in states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. They got the second prize.

“We are already using plastic pellets to lay roads. The rice straw has high silicon dioxide content and can be made into pellets through cooling and condensing process. It can also replace bitumen while laying roads. Using rice straw pellets can prevent excessive mining besides stopping the stubble burning in the northern states,” they said.

SVS Manohar, a class XI student from Visakhapatnam came up with an idea to use virtual reality to bring traffic discipline among motorists. “Currently, the process for getting a licence is too simple. Motorists are not following traffic rules. We can make passing virtual reality training mandatory for getting a licence. The training should simulate real-time traffic and assess the candidate how they respond to free roads or traffic roads,” he said. He along with two other teams won third prize jointly.

File photo of migratory birds at Sambhar Lake

JAIPUR: Normalcy is slowly returning to Sambhar , the largest inland salt lake in the country, as no bird death has been reported in past one week. According to the records, since December 28, 2019, the forest has not registered a single fresh death. Also, the migratory birds continue to flock the lake large numbers.

In November more than 20,000 migratory birds fell prey to avian botulism which was reported in India for the first time, it is usually common in USA and Russia. Following this, state administration swung into action and removed carcasses from the lake that marked reduction in conducive medium available for the spores to manifest. Moreover, the dip in temperature further created unfavourable situation for the bacterium to grow and spread.

Dr Asha Sharma, associate professor and ornithologist, said, “Clostridium botulinum, the toxin producing bacterium responsible for avian botulism spreads in areas with high biological oxygen demand and the carcasses also help in spore formation. The bacterium grows and spreads through spore formation in anaerobic conditions.”

The carcasses of birds who were the first victims of this outbreak, along with rich organic matter accumulated as a result of surplus monsoon and increased human activity, serving as the perfect medium for this bacterium. As the said carcasses were removed, there was a marked reduction in conducive medium available for the spores to grow in.

Sharma added, “The dip in temperature further created unfavourable situation for the bacterium to grow and spread. This dip also facilitated reduction in organic matter. These two factors subsequently led to a significant decrease in the biochemical oxygen demand in the lake water and hence increased levels of dissolved oxygen in the water. These conditions roughly translate to better oxygenation of water and creation of an aerobic ecosystem. Since anaerobic conditions are more conducive to the growth of clostridium botulinum , a more oxygenated, aerated and aerobic lake meant healthier conditions.”

According to the birdwatchers, migratory birds continue to flock the lake in large numbers. The concerned authorities too are not taking any chances and teams continue to monitor the situation at lake.

Om Prakash, president of Wildlife Creature Organisation said, “At present, there are over 1.5 lakh birds at the lake. Not only has mortality reduced, but the number of birds which need to be rescued has also come down. On Wednesday, we rescued one pond heron and released it after medication.”

88,['6/01/2020'],$5 trillion economy by 2025 not possible: Former RBI boss,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Chennai: India’s aim to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025 is not possible with the current economic growth rate, former Reserve Bank of India governor and former chairman of Prime Minister’s economic advisory council C Rangarajan said on Sunday.

Rangarajan interacted with students on “The $5 Trillion Goal” during a talk at Shaastra, the IIT Madras’ tech festival.

“People have been talking about India becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2025. It is an aspirational goal. Today, our GDP is close to $2.7 trillion. Therefore, reaching $5 trillion is almost close to doubling our GDP,” he said.

“If you have to move from $2.7 trillion to $5 trillion economy, it will take seven years if the economy grows at 9% per annum and eight or nine years if it grows at 8% per annum,” Rangarajan said.

“Reaching $5 trillion by 2025 is ruled out as we are not in that region at all. In fact, in the first quarter of the year, the GDP growth is 5% and in the second quarter, it was 4.5%. For 2019-20, the growth rate may not exceed 5%. For 2020-21, perhaps the economy may pick up and even then, the growth may not exceed 6%. Therefore, we are not anywhere near 8% or 9% of growth that is required to reach the $5 trillion economy,” he said.

Rangarajan said a sustained rate of growth of the economy between 8% and 9% was needed to achieve it and the per capita income also should be doubled from $1,800 to $3,600.

On the economic slowdown, Rangarajan said, “As of now, the economy is slowing down. The GDP, which is a measure of the overall performance of the economy, has slowed down considerably. The investment rate has fallen from 35.2% six years ago to around 27% now. There is a significant decline in the investment rate. Investment rate is important if the economy needs to grow. We need to address the issue.”

Rangarajan called the demonetisation as a “big management blunder”. “They took away 75% of currency in circulation, but the extent of new currency printed was so little. The demonetisation itself is not the cause of problem for people suffering. The demonetisation coupled with inability of the government to substitute old currency by new currency was the real problem. Any calculation would have showed them that they did not have enough currency. It is clearly one of the biggest management failures,” he said.

Crackdown: The joint team of Thrikkakara police and Dansaf arrested the accused person from an industrial area... Read More

KOCHI: District anti-narcotics special action force (Dansaf) of the city police foiled yet another bid to smuggle ganja into the city. During a special drive held as part of ‘Drug-Free Kochi ’ campaign, Dansaf and Thrikkakara police nabbed an Odisha native with 3kg of the contraband.

Identifying the arrested person as Tapan Kumar Genna (39) of Balasor, Odisha, officers said the arrest was based on intelligence received by Dansaf about the suppliers of the contraband to peddlers in various part of the city. Police said the accused landed in their net even as they were conducting intensified inspections at various parts of the city. The joint team of Thrikkakara police and Dansaf arrested the accused person from an industrial area at Thuthiyoor.

Police said the accused used to come to Kochi twice every month via train and that he was a major link in the smuggling network. He used to bring about 10kg of the contraband from his hometown and used to sell it in smaller quantities. The accused used to take orders for 2 to 3kg of the contraband and once done with the delivery he used to go back with fresh orders.

Police came to know about some of the customers of the accused and the investigation surrounding them led to the areas where the accused frequents. Police said they had kept these areas under surveillance for weeks.

Officers said the ‘Drug-Free Kochi’ drive has been envisaged by city police commissioner Vijay Sakhare. Action is initiated against those who abuse drugs as well, said police. Police said suburbs near West Kochi, Tripunithura, Kalamassery and Thrikkakara are being extensively monitored to prevent drug abuse.

The arrest was made by Dansaf SI Joseph Sajan and Thrikkakara SI Abdul Jamal under the supervision of ACP S T Suresh Kumar and DCP G Poonguzhali.

The case invoking relevant Sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was registered at Thrikkarkara police station and further probe is on. Police urged residents to cooperate with the drive and to tip them on 9497980430 if they come across instances of drug abuse or drug peddling. They said the details of the informants would be kept confidential.

KOLKATA: Officers of Kasba police station walked the extra mile on Saturday to help a young Bangladeshi woman and her mother, who had come to the police station to report a loss of Rs 30,000 from their room at a star-category hotel off EM Bypass . When the duo realised that they were getting late to catch a flight back home, the officers escorted them to the airport in additional OC’s car and also located the missing money from under the mattress of the hotel room on Saturday night.

“The money could be recovered from under the mattress of northern side bed of Room 106 where the duo had been staying. It seems that in haste and panic, they couldn’t recollect the place where they had kept the money,” said an officer of south suburban division.

An officer of Kasba PS said they have informed the woman that the money has been recovered. “The woman keeps visiting Kolkata and once she is here we can hand over the money to her or to anyone she authorises. We can even send a letter of intimation to her,” he said.

Mehreen Shimeen Hassan (28), a resident of Dhaka, had come to Kolkata with her mother on December 31 and put up at a five star hotel off Bypass. At the time of checking out on Saturday afternoon, Hassan realised Rs 8000 (four notes of Rs 2000 each) in Indian currency and Rs 22,000 in Bangladeshi currency was missing. They visited the PS around 3pm.

“The woman appeared tensed as they were in a hurry to catch a flight back home in evening. Considering the urgency of the situation, the officers took down the complaint and turned it into an FIR under Section 380 of IPC (theft) against unknown miscreants,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. By the time the procedure was over, it was already past 4pm and the duo was too late to catch the flight scheduled to leave Kolkata at 6.10pm. “I called the office of Novo Air, where the passengers were booked. They gave me the airline manager’s number at airport and I called him and requested him not to allow the aircraft to fly till they reached airport,” said Ashadur Rahman, additional OC of Kasba PS.

“At airport, we requested the CISF to treat it as a special case and give them preference in security check,” he said, adding he had left only after the woman called him from airline manager’s mobile informing him that she had boarded the flight.

HYDERABAD: Next time you shop online, beware of fraudsters luring you with discounts and gifts. Cyberabad cybercrime police on Friday arrested four fraudsters for cheating a city-based victim in the guise of online lottery. The accused pretended to be employees of online shopping portal SnapDeal.

Police found that there have been over 50 such lottery fraud cases, and many victims were lured by discounts and lotteries on shopping portals. Haritha (name changed), a 26-year-old private employee from Rajendranagar lost Rs 96,000 in an online racket run by fraudsters claiming to be employees of popular e-commerce site Amazon.

Haritha was offered OnePlus 7T Pro mobile phone for Rs 46,000 if she makes purchases totalling Rs 5,000 on Amazon Great Indian Sale. The offenders shared a fake invoice letter for the purchase made on WhatsApp . By asking her to pay for refundable charges and other charges, the offenders duped her into paying Rs 96,000.

In another case, 30-year-old Jagan (name changed), a businessman from Lingampally, lost Rs 1.3 lakh after fraudsters lured him with a fake gift voucher from Big Bazaar. Jagan received a message with a link he thought was from PayTM. On clicking the URL, he received a message stating he has won an LED TV. He was asked to make several payments through refunds. After Jagan paid Rs 1.3 lakh, the fraudsters switched off their phones and Jagan realised that he was cheated.

The cybercrime police recently shared concerns over the increasing lottery fraud cases and advised citizens to stay away from unrealistic offers. “The offenders now manage to obtain customer database on the darknet and use that to lure the victims. They also purchase toll-free numbers to look genuine. No one will ask for money in return for lottery or gift. If the offer seems too good, one should be suspicious,” said a police officer.

Madurai: The meeting of NGO ‘Nandri Maravel’ has called on the corporation to include shelters for street dogs smart city programme being implemented in Madurai. They have asked the civic body to not eradicate them as they are very much part of the community.

Nandri Maravel has been working for the welfare of dogs living on the streets in the city for the last one year. K P Marikumar, coordinator of the trust, said that dogs living on the streets should not be called street dogs, but instead termed community dogs. “Most of the dogs which are abandoned on the roads or born on the streets are native breeds which are being shunned by the local people who try to breed foreign breeds which are expensive,” he said. Before the corporation takes steps to check the population of community dogs it should also ban foreign breeds, he said.

“When a person complains to the corporation about street dog menace, it is the responsibility of the authorities to check their homes and see if they are having foreign dog breeds as pets,” he said. These people should be condemned for treating native dog breeds as a menace, he said.

The meeting of the NGO held on Saturday said that street dogs are protected under the Indian Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. As per the act, a municipal corporation cannot kill or dislocate community dogs. “They also cannot pick-up the dogs because some people or administrators do not like them. These dogs can only be sterlised and vaccinated by the civic body. A recent audio advertisement by the civic body says that people should not encourage or feed street dogs, this is a violation of a rule. It is the responsibility of the corporation to declare how they are going to treat the dogs under the Smart city program,” he said.

Members of the NGO, who come from various small organisations, spend about Rs 25,000 each on food, vaccination and sterilization of the dogs in their care every month. “There is lot of discrimination when it comes to female dogs, which are rarely taken up for sterlization because they need better care, but it should be done equally for female and male animals,” he added.

Allahabad: Five members of a family , including two children aged seven and two, were killed by unidentified intruders at their Yusufpur home under Soraon thana on Allahabad-Varanasi highway, around 30km from the city, in the small hours of Sunday.

The bodies of Somdutt Tiwari (32), who owned a small-scale transport business, his father Vijay Shankar Tiwari (60), wife Soni Tiwari (28) and the couple’s two sons Kanha (7) and Kunj (2) were found in puddles of blood in three separate rooms in the morning. The assailants had used home tools such as a kitchen knife and a grinding stone to stab, hack or batter the five to death.

Police suspect there were at least five intruders and three persons are being detained for questioning. Although preliminary investigation hasn’t been able to determine the motive behind the gruesome murders, cops are not ruling out property dispute, revenge killing or a burglary gone wrong since an almirah and two trunks have been rummaged through. Homicide investigators are quizzing neighbours and waiting for Tiwari’s extended family to arrive in Yusufpur.

Senior police officers, including IG (Allahabad range) KP Singh and Allahabad SSP Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj, who inspected the crime scene said forensic experts had been pressed into service.

SSP Pankaj said neighbours discovered the murders when no one from the Tiwari family came out of the house past 10.30am. “The main door was not locked from inside, which raised suspicions. On pushing the door open, villagers saw bloodstains. The bodies were in separate rooms. The woman and her youngest were in one, the man and the older son in another and the elderly man was in a third room. Household tools like a knife, an axe, a grinding stone and a chisel were used as weapons,” the SSP added.

IG Singh said three police teams had been formed to crack the murder. “The motive is yet to be ascertained. We are probing every possible angle such as property dispute and old enmity. Valuables may also have been stolen from the house,” he added.

The horrific news of five of a family being murdered spread like wildfire in Yusufpur and its adjoining areas. Scores of people gathered outside the Tiwari residence either out of curiosity or to voice their protest against the law and order situation. Police used barrier tape to protect the crime scene and evidence. Forces from three police stations have been deployed to defuse the tension.

Panaji: Over a year and half has gone by, but the state government is yet to start the process to appoint a new chairperson for the State Police Complaints Authority even as 83 complaints are pending before the body.

A senior government officer said that they are in the process of approaching the high court to seek names of retired judges to appoint as a new chairperson for SPCA. The officer said that once they get the names, they would be placed before the government to select the chairman.

SPCA sources said that the staff on contract basis at the authority has not been paid salaries for last two months.

The tenure of the last SPCA chairman Justice RMS Khandeparkar came to an end on April 15, 2018. The three-member SPCA comprises a chairman and two other members. Sources said the two other members are hearing cases, but are unable to pass orders without a chairman.

In 2014, the state government issued a memorandum restricting SPCA from taking suo motu cognisance of misconduct by the police personnel. The move had drawn wide criticism from activists and public as there is an increase in the number of cases filed against the law enforcers in the last five years.

The SPCA has recommended disciplinary proceedings against some of them. It has even directed some of the men in uniform to perform social service, requiring them to educate members of 10 village panchayats about the existence, functioning, purpose and utility as well as the procedure followed by SPCA to dispose complaints in case the police failed to file a first information report (FIR).

Most of the complaints filed with the SPCA relate to the police refusing to register FIRs. Other complaints refer to police personnel assaulting the complainant when an FIR was asked to be registered. In one such case, the complainant had stated he had been harassed by the police, while registering an FIR. Other complaints include abuse of power and arrest without valid reasons.

JAIPUR: Even as the FASTag coverage in Rajasthan reached 53.68% and toll collection crossed 66%, many truck drivers use innovative tricks to evade toll tax on national highways. The truck drivers have adopted two-tag tactic, i.e. carrying two stickers (valid and blacklisted), to evade tax at the toll plazas.

“NHAI has taken action against a few truck drivers by blacklisting both the stickers used by them,” said M K Jain, chief general manager, NHAI regional office (Rajasthan).

Earlier, the truck drivers also misused the ""enable and disable"" feature of PayTM wallets to evade toll tax. After NHAI took up the issue with PayTM, they deactivated the feature on their wallet.

“We have asked IHMCL (Indian Highways Management Company Limited) to identify these vehicles (carrying two tags). We have caught some truck drivers, who were using two tags in order to evade toll tax. These drivers usually paste the blacklisted tag on the windscreen. First, they would argue with the toll plaza officials for 5-10 minutes with the hope that they would be allowed to go after a long argument. Then, they put pressure on the officials to check with the hand-held machines. If they are not allowed to leave, they either take out the valid tag and get it scanned or make the payment through cash.”

“By using this ploy, if they are allowed to go by the toll plaza officials coming under pressure due to the increasing traffic, they can save Rs 1,000-1,500 each day. So, they use these tricks to evade toll tax. So, this is causing some problems, leading to traffic congestion at the toll plazas,” said Jain.

“When they lodge a complaint on the helpline number 1033, they give the number of the valid sticker, and not the blacklisted one, which is pasted on the windscreen. After calling, they would complain why were they not allowed to go. But when the numbers were tallied on the system, they didn't match,” he added, saying both the stickers of these truck drivers, who were caught, have been blacklisted.

KOLKATA: A picnic party turned tragic after three persons, including a seven-year-old boy, were electrocuted at Baneswarpur in Usti on the southern fringes of the city on Sunday. All the three victims were from Mograhat in South 24 Parganas.

Mofijul Molla (34) had come along with his seven-year-old son Rizuwan Molla and another 10 to 12 others to the picnic spot at Baneswarpur, 25 kilometres from Mograhat. Around 11am, Rizuwan, while playing, entered an abandoned house and went to its roof.

According to a relative, there was an electric wire on the roof which Rizuwan touched and tried to throw when he was electrocuted. It was noticed by his father Molla and another member of the group, Gaffar Laskar (32), who rushed to his rescue and were also electrocuted. Later, officers of Usti PS reached the spot and sent the trio to Baneswarpur hospital where Rizuwan and Laskar were declared brought dead. Molla was shifted to Diamond Harbour Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries around 5pm.

NEW DELHI: Demanding justice for the attack on students and teachers at JNU and calling for the registration of an FIR against those involved in the attacks, hundreds of students from Delhi University, Jamia Millia Islamia and other universities assembled outside Delhi Police headquarters at ITO on Sunday evening.Raising chants of “aar ho ya paar ho, aaj FIR ho”, the protest carried on till midnight, with students stating they would only move out until Delhi Police acts on the matter. The protest was led by SFI students and Jamia Coordination Committee.Pritesh Menon, a student at South Asian University and Delhi state secretary at SFI, said the attack on JNU students was a clear sign that police and government were trying to suppress any form of protest.“It’s clear that the government is threatened by students reacting to its policies. Students have been at the forefront of all protests and we’ve simply been doing what we can in a democracy. Once they see students not toeing their line, there have been attacks at universities,” said Menon.Around 100 students had gathered outside the police headquarters at 9pm. However, the numbers continued to swell and by 10.30pm had blocked the road, forcing police to divert traffic. Anil Kumar, a cab driver headed towards Noida, said it took him nearly 30 minutes to move out of ITO. “I’ll now have to find an alternate route. The entire road is blocked,” he added.Waqar Azam, a Jamia student outside the police headquarters, said the attacks on universities are an attempt to suppress the voices of students. “Our immediate demand is that an FIR be registered against all those found guilty in the attacks at JNU. We also want the government to take action and speak on this matter. Why is the home minister, under whom Delhi Police comes, not doing anything?” he asked.Aditi from SFI, a student at Ambedkar University, said, “We condemn the attack. The anger of students is increasing. Students, a lot of whom were ABVP members, entered the JNU campus with weapons. Where was the security? Police brutality and, in this case, their inaction has to stop. Students need to feel safe in their own campus.”Former AAP MLA Alka Lamba and CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat were among those who had reached ITO to show solidarity with the students. “I’ve visited the hospitals where students and professors have been taken. They have been brutally assaulted. Such attacks on universities need to stop.

101,['6/01/2020'],"To pave way for CWH, HC grants 3 months to settle FRA claims in Melghat","This story is from January 6, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: Justices SC Dharmadhikari and RI Chagla at the Bombay High Court have directed the authorities concerned to take a decision on pending claims under Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, in Melghat in three months.

Due to pendency of FRA claims, tribal rights NGOs and civil societies organizations have stalled process to notify critical wildlife habitats (CWH). CWH are defined under the FRA as “areas of national parks and sanctuaries where it has been specifically and clearly established, case by case, on the basis of scientific and objective criteria, that such areas are required to be kept as inviolate for the purposes of wildlife conservation.”

The HC order comes in a PIL filed by NGO Vanashakti in 2014, demanding identification of CWH as mandated in the FRA, directing respondent-state government to determine CWH in Maharashtra and take immediate steps to prevent further degradation of forests and critical wildlife areas.

Even as implementation of FRA is in full swing, not even one hectare of forest area in the country has been notified as CWH. The next date of hearing is slated for March 11, 2020.

In this PIL, on September 9, 2019, a division bench headed by chief justice Pradeep Nandrajog had directed the state-level committee to notify the scientific data and the objective criteria, which it proposes to adopt before CWH are notified in Maharashtra.

The petitioners contend that while court ensures effective and proper implementation of FRA, it should not ignore the concerns of environmentalists and public-spirited citizens regarding protection of ecology and environment, particularly forests.

The state government has approved expert committees for 54 protected areas (PAs) to identify CWHs. Out of these 54, 22 areas are in Western Maharashtra, 23 under the jurisdiction of APCCF (wildlife), Nagpur East, and nine under field director Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR).

There are over 300 villages in Melghat. MTR also has been identified and declared as a critical tiger habitat (CTH) under the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972.

The bone of contention is 21 villages inside Melghat sanctuary currently inhabited by tribal communities. Over 7 villages were voluntarily relocated. Pournima Upadhyay of NGO Khoj working in Melghat, who tried to intervene in the PIL, argues that if these tribals are shifted they are not used to the way of life outside forest and therefore, they are suffering.

Upadhyay’s contention was that CWH would be recognized for all times to come after which the right holders would be resettled from the CWH and will not be able to ever come back to the same areas. Hence, before such a decision is taken, she urged the court to make her intervention in the PIL.

Hearing all the parties, the court granted three months’ time to decided pending claims. “If these applications are received and they are found to be in order, the claims raised shall be dealt with and decided strictly in accordance with law. Similarly, all claims already received and pending at the initial stage shall also be decided within this period,” the court ruled.

“We also expect the appellate authority, which may have been approached by those whose claims have been rejected partially or fully, to deal with the appeals expeditiously and take a decision thereon within the above-mentioned duration,” it said.

The court also asked to involve tribal development department and forest department so that the claims are dealt with comprehensively and properly. Both departments have been asked to upgrade and update their websites.

The court also allowed claims to be raised within three months and said they also shall be dealt with in terms of the directions issued aforesaid.

Indore: After winning the first two quarters of Swachh Survekshan 2020, Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) is now eyeing 7-star garbage free rating to secure 1000 additional marks under the survey.

IMC officials are leaving no stone unturned to maintain the city’s cleanest image. They have intensified cleanliness and monitoring work to ensure everything on place during physical verification for 7-star garbage free rating. The civic body has already submitted initial self-declaration for 7-star garbage free rating and final submission of documents is also over.

A team from the Centre is likely to visit the city within a day or two to verify claims of IMC for necessary criteria under the star rating protocol. It would be an 8 to 10 days visit and separate teams would be conducting the survey, officials said. “The team will be visiting random locations including residential and commercial areas and public gardens to check for collection, disposal, composting of wet waste and bulk or community composting among others. The team will collect over 50 pictorial evidence from each ward of the city to verify our claims,” said an official.

The team would also check for potholes and damages on major roads and streets in wards since they are also important criteria under the survey.

On Sunday, cabinet minister Jitu Patwari and IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh along with other senior officials of IMC visited residential localities including, Parmanu Nagar, Sai Nath Colony, Rajshree Vatika and Classic Purnima to take stock of arrangements made for on spot disposal of solid waste.

IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh said, “We want people to join hands with us in our cleanliness campaigns. We are also running awareness drives to make citizens feel that they are also a part of the initiative and urge them to keep the city clean on their personal level”.

Road sweeping and cleaning activities even during night hours have also been increased. IMC expects to secure 500 marks under ODF++ and Water Plus certifications of which validation work recently got over.

Bareilly: Additional development officer (ADO) of Behjam panchayat allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in his house in Neemgaon area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Sunday and purportedly blamed the chief development officer (CDO) for his extreme step in the suicide note he left behind. The ADO’s family has given a written complaint to Neemgaon police in this connection.

The victim, Ramchandra Gautam, Behjam gram panchayat development officer, who also had an additional charge of ADO, in his suicide note — a copy of which is also with TOI — stated that he was under immense pressure as “the development works in my block remained incomplete because of my subordinates who never followed my instructions”.

The ADO requested that his family members shouldn’t be harassed for his decision to take the extreme step.

In a complaint lodged at Neemgaon police station, Gautam’s son Sandeep Kumar charged the CDO and the block development officer (BDO) with harassing his father, because he was a Dalit.

“My father was under extreme mental pressure for over past one month due to ill-treatment meted out to him by the CDO. He was even forced to work on holidays. On Saturday, after a meeting with the BDO, my father called me up over my mobile phone and said something disastrous had happened with him and he was very upset. My father committed suicide because he was harassed by his seniors. An FIR should be registered against them.”

District magistrate Shailendra Singh, meanwhile, ordered a probe into the matter, though no FIR was registered till the filing of this report.

When TOI contacted, the DM confirmed the suicide, saying, “Gautam committed suicide at his house on Sunday morning. He was given the additional charge of ADO nearly four months ago. We came to know that he was under tremendous pressure due to work-related issues. The autopsy will be conducted by a panel of doctors. Meanwhile, we have sought the details of his calls to investigate the complaint lodged by his family members.”

Asked whether the action would be taken against the CDO or the BDO, the DM said, “Action will be taken against all those officials who are found responsible for Gautam’s suicide. We will also take cognisance of the suicide note, where Gautam mentioned that his sub-ordinates used to ignore his instructions. We will look into all aspects and take necessary action.”

106,['6/01/2020'],Speeding vehicles a threat to wildlife on PTR roads,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Pilibhit: High-speed traffic on the roads passing through the core forest area of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) is posing a grave threat to wildlife. According to official records, more than a dozen wild animals, including some listed in schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, have been run over by speeding vehicles over the past two years on the jungle roads.

According to forest officials, acute staff crunch has restrained them from deploying pickets of field forest force on the roads to check vehicles from speeding. They also blamed the PWD for failing to build speed breakers on these roads despite sending them numerous letters.

The PTR which spans across 73,024 hectares comprises 60,279.80 hectares of core forest area. Four roads pass through the core area. Of these, a 7-km stretch of Pilibhit-Basti national highway 730 and 9-km on Pilibhit-Madhotanda road through Mala range of PTR witness heavy traffic every day.

A 13-km stretch of Madhotanda-Khatema road that connects Pilibhit with Uttarakhand passes through the core area of Mahof forest range while a 6-km stretch of Puranpur-Dhanara Ghat road, which has the least traffic, passes through the core forest area of Haripur forest range.

“All these roads divide the core forest area, increasing possibility of of fatal accidents of wildlife as wild animals are known to cross the roads to move from one part of the forest to another,” said H. Rajamohan, field director of PTR.

“The threat of speeding traffic peaks at dusk when tigers hunt for prey and move about their territory. At this time, they face the risk of being mowed down by speeding vehicles,” added Rajamohan.

Referring to a tigress with cubs which is hiding near the Pilibhit – Basti highway in Mala forest range, the field director said this big cat family is at risk of being run over. Wild herbivores were equally at risk, specially at night, he added.

“We have placed boards at various places displaying the maximum permitted speed at 30km an hour along with appeals to drive cautiously in jungle stretches due presence wildlife but motorists mostly drive at over 70-80km an hour especially on NH 730 and Pilibhit-Madhotanda road as they are quite smooth,” said Naveen Khandelwal, deputy director of PTR.

“We have written five letters to the executive engineer of PWD’s provincial division to construct rumble strips every one kilometer within the forest stretch on all four roads to cut speed of vehicles but they were never responded,” said Rajamohan.

On being asked about it, executive engineer Har Swaroop said, “We will start constructing the rumble strips as soon as the winter season is over as the coal tar needs warm weather to melt and mix properly with stone ballast,” he said.

Congress’ Priyanka Gandhi visits AIIMS trauma centre on Sunday night (ANI Photo)

NEW DELHI: Chaos reigned outside AIIMS trauma centre till late on Sunday as many ambulances carrying injured students kept arriving at the hospital. Heavy security, including half a dozen private guards and four policemen, was deployed at the entrance to prevent the entry of non-injured people.

More than 50 people, including students and a couple of professors, gathered at the spot to find out the nature of injuries sustained by the victims. Guards had to repeatedly step in to remove the crowd from gathering outside the gates. Even media personnel were not allowed to enter. Hospital staff said that while one student was severely injured, eight others had “mid-level” injuries.

Brinda Karat came out of the trauma centre around 9.40pm informing that 16 students and two professors were being treated there. She claimed that the professors had been hit with blunt objects and no student could have carried out such barbarity.

“ABVP, with the help of police, attacked the JNUSU president with an iron rod. She has serious injuries on her head. X-rays and CT scan are being currently carried out to know the extent of injuries,” Karat alleged. ABVP and Left students could be seen arguing about the attackers being from the opposite camp.

At least 20 students were admitted to the trauma centre. Senior doctors confirmed to TOI that JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh was one of them. “She has suffered a head injury. We are getting a CT scan done to assess the damage,” one of the doctors told TOI. He added there were at least eight other patients brought from JNU with injuries in the chest, leg and other body parts. Five others had been admitted with minor injuries.

“One of the girls complained of chest compression. We examined her and ruled out a life-threatening injury. She will be kept under observation. If her condition remains stable, she will be allowed to go home,” the doctor added.

One of the professors, aged around 40, was rushed to Safdarjung hospital’s emergency wing. A hospital spokesperson confirmed that the professor had blunt trauma for which X-ray had been done. “We have kept him under observation to rule out serious damage,” she added.

Late at night, political leaders visited the injured, which included Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi and BJP leader Vijay Goel. Due to the chaos, gates had been closed and Congress leaders Ajay Maken and Jai Prakash were not let inside.

110,['6/01/2020'],Hyderabad News - Times of India,"This story is from January 6, 2020

With Kapra lake looking at a complete revamp thanks to Central funds, TOI asked readers for suggestions for the restoration of lakes

What should authorities do to improve the condition of city lakes?

The first step in saving the lakes of the city is ensuring that politicians and authorities with vested interests are kept away from the water bodies as most encroachments happen with the knowledge of those in power. There must be clear demarcation or fencing around lakes to prevent people from constructing illegal structures on the lake bed. Also, when the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation can ban immersion and religious rituals around Sabarmati, the same yardstick should be applied here. Political parties must not be allowed to interfere in the decision and the lake must not be used to host religious rites. Strict policies should be imposed against misuse of lake in the name of any religion.

N Nagarajan

The shrinking area of lakes, the growing piles of filth and encroachment of lakes highlight the apathy of authorities, citizens and illegal inhabitants. A strict vigil, deployment of security personnel, and foolproof barricade must be put in place to conserve lakes and, this must be done on top priority. Water inlets that bring waste from sewers and drains into lakes should be diverted. Water hyacinth should be contained, so that overgrowth that affects the water organisms and animals can be avoided. A beautiful park for butterflies, ornamental plants and trees that are indigenous to the area and of medicinal importance should be planted and taken care of. Trees that are being cut for road widening purpose should be transplanted around lakes as part of an afforestation program. Water bodies should be protected as a natural asset.

Deepesh Surana

Preventing water pollution from point and non-point sources, eliminating nutrient-rich sedimentation are all important steps to be taken to protect lakes. Some of the lakes in Hyderabad are natural and many are man-made bodies. According to various sources, a few decades ago, a large number of water reservoirs, lakes, rivers and ponds were present in Hyderabad. Most lakes have been completely wiped out, and the majority of surviving lakes have shrunk to the surface and turned into small ponds and cesspools. Of the thousands of water bodies in and around Hyderabad in the 1970s, less than 500 of them survive today. Government agencies and private parties are equally responsible for this fall in number. The existing lakes have been used to dump garbage and drainage water. According to state laws, no construction is allowed on the lake bed. Authorities should look into the matter and ensure that the city's water reservoir is not crossed by government agencies or private parties.

Syed Shamsuddin

First and foremost, authorities must save all the existing lakes before thinking of creating new ones. I request them to consult experts, listen to them and implement their recommendations. On war footing, proper fencing must be done, and bunds must be constructed. Unauthorized entry by people for bathing and cleaning cattle must be prevented. Convert lakesides into tourist spots and keep them clean and tidy. Segregate the lakes into various categories such as tourism, boating etc. Create awareness about the importance of lakes, its benefits to humanity, and how we can all help preserve lakes.Prepare an action plan for proper water treatment, effective cleansing and tackling water hyacinth and weeds. A phased implementation should be taken up. A separate action plan needs to be in place for important lakes such as Himayatsagar, Gandipet lake, Tank bund. A systematic study has to be done on how so many lakes in the city have vanished.

Ramesh Vemuganti

Despite innumerable lakes in Hyderabad being encroached for years, authorities seem to exhibit a lackadaisical attitude. The few lakes that have not been encroached have turned into dumpyards. The lakes that have been ignored for years due to the laxity of civic officials badly needs undivided attention from the government. These lakes have potential to be turned into a recreation spot for residents and this has to be further worked on. A small, well-protected playground for kids around these lakes is a much-needed addition that will allow them to play and relax amidst the chaos of city life.

Panaji: Goa police have written to the Central Science Forensic Laboratory (CSFL), Hyderabad to expedite the chemical analysis of viscera of the three persons who died during the recently held electronic dance music (EDM) festival.

The three died outside the venue of the Sunburn Klassique EDM event which was held from December 27 to 29 at Vagator.

Although police are yet to confirm the cause of death of the three persons, an official said the deaths have one thing in common — cerebral and pulmonary edema. But what led to it, police said, will only be known with accuracy when the chemical analysis reports are received.

Speaking to TOI, north Goa superintendent of police, Utkrisht Prasoon confirmed that they have written to CSFL to speed up the viscera analysis. Doctors at Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital have reserved the cause of death and are awaiting CSFL’s report.

The three persons who died at the EDM festival venue were Sai Prasad, 32, of Hyderabad, who was an IT engineer, Venkat, 31, a Visakhapatnam-based businessman, and Phanideep Khota, an automobile engineer from Hyderabad who was working as a sales executive in Bengaluru.

Prasad and Venkat were in Goa to attend the EDM festival. They were among 150 people standing in queue on the first day of the festival to enter the venue. The gates hadn’t opened at the time the incident took place.

Police said that one of the two first began to shiver, and the other immediately held him to prevent him from falling. Two others also came forward to help, and they took the shivering youth to the police outpost.

At the police outpost, while the first man was being administered first aid, the other also began shivering. An ambulance was immediately summoned, and both were shifted to the Mapusa district hospital, where doctors declared them brought dead.

On December 29, Khota lost consciousness outside the festival locale at 9.30pm, and was soon rushed to the first aid centre at the venue. He was later shifted to a private hospital at Vagator where he was declared dead. Khota had arrived in Goa along with five other friends on December 28 to celebrate New Year and were staying at Calangute.

<p>Police take away protesters banners at Defence Colony park<br></p>

NEW DELHI: Attempts to organise gatherings against Citizenship Amendment Act and a possible NRC were met with resistance from local police as well as hecklers in south Delhi localities on Sunday.

For an afternoon gathering in Defence Colony’s Durga Puja park , a dozen policemen were deployed since morning to oversee the proceedings called to discuss the new law. Placards were snatched and the use of a mini-loudspeaker was prohibited citing that no permission had been granted for a protest.

Bhavreen Kandhari, one of the organisers, remarked that this was supposed to be an interaction to share details about CAA and NRC. “This is an awareness drive. Do we need permission for even sitting in a park and discussing things? Some of the policemen were carrying rifles and sticks,” Kandhari said. “It is heartening to see young students teach us compassion and secularism, and surprisingly adults fear even listening to them.”

After removal of all posters and the loudspeaker, the gathering of 60-70 people — including youngsters, working professionals and elderly — continued in the form of a discussion on the CAA provisions and the impact of the Act. Participants’ speeches were, however, videographed by security personnel.

Promila Chaturvedi, a 79-year-old participant, said she felt strongly about the issue. “I do not have a birth certificate and I refuse to show my papers even if they send me to a detention camp,” she added. Shahid Siddqui, a former Rajya Sabha member, argued that with the movement being led by youngsters, India cannot be compared to Germany. “We rejected the two-nation theory in 1947 and we reject any attempts to divide Hindus and Muslims,” he said.

Nandita Rao, a senior lawyer, explained the various provisions of the Act. “The Constitution mandates equal treatment for all. Now they are singling out one religion, and in future, a caste and gender may be singled out,” Rao said. Rajeev Suri, another resident, remarked that while a lot of conversation is focusing on the persecution of minorities, there is no mention of persecution in the Act. “It is a blatantly discriminatory Act and hopefully it will be stuck down by the courts,” he added. The gathering carried out a reading of the preamble of the Constitution.

Several attempts were made by hecklers to disrupt the discussion but policemen finally intervened to diffuse the tension. “Don’t close your eyes. The cat will come eat all of you pigeons. Where else will Hindus go,” the hecklers shouted.

A second neighbourhood protest in south Delhi was planned in Govindpuri, but that too was denied permission from police. A small number of protesters, nevertheless, gathered to mark their presence.

113,['6/01/2020'],Mackerel is Kochiites’ favourite fish,"This story is from January 6, 2020

KOCHI: In a pilot study done to assess demand drivers in augmenting fish consumption in Ernakulam city, CMFRI researchers found that mackerel remains the mo

st preferred fish with a high score of 0.577 followed by sardine 0.561 in the preference index analysis.

A preference assessment index is the composite index which takes into account numerous parameters which determine fish consumption like availability, accessibility, quality, nutrition, tradition, etc.

There exists a high uniformity between the respondents in buying mackerel as well as sardine. The major constraints in fish consumption were lack of fresh fish, high price and irregular supply. “Fresh fish was of popular demand and that was why consumers were even looking at online markets,” said Shyam S Salim, principal scientist, CMFRI.

The study points out that the average monthly income of the respondents has a very good role on the fish consumption as about 38% of the income is used for purchasing fish. Around 54.2% of the total respondents were purchasing fish on a daily basis and about 72% of the respondents depended on the retail centres for purchasing fish.

The nutritional values of mackerel (0.84%) as well as the tradition in eating sardine (0.85%) are the major reasons of the respondents preferring both. The taste and the tradition are marked as the important drivers in the consumption of anchovies whereas for tuna, availability is the major reason for preference. The taste of prawns and the accessibility of sole fish are the reasons for their preference. Also, the availability of threadfin breams, quality of seer fish and crab, taste and preference of pomfret, etc. are the major reasons for the consumption of these species by the respondents.

One of the major objectives of the study was to assess the trends and pattern of fish consumption and to analyse factors that drive people to consume fish and also to assess the major constraints faced by the consumers.

The fish production issues, middle-men problems, impacts of climate change are some reasons for lack of fresh fish. The respondents said that purchase and demand of the fish have not been reduced yet due to these reasons and their fish consumption has only increased fairly despite the high prices. But the irregular supply as well as the poor access and other reasons force them to depend on fish products and other sources.

ALLAHABAD: Pointing the finger of suspicion at nomadic tribes — locally called ‘Ghumantu’ — in the quintuple Soraon homicide case, police are collating data on the recent crimes pulled off by these migrating groups that are infamous for break-ins at homes along highways.

That the intruders at Somdutt Tiwari’s house on Allahabad-Varanasi highway showed no mercy and used crude weapons such as kitchen knife, grinding stone and chisel to kill him, his father, wife and their two children are factors that indicate possible involvement of the nomads, sources in the Crime Branch said. Committing crimes along highways and railway stations allowed nomads an easy escape route , the sleuths added.

Allahabad SSP Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said the killers targeted Tiwari and his family members in their sleep. “Stealth is a well-established modus operandi of nomadic groups. Although relatives have named a few suspects, we have not found their motives yet and hence, cannot rule out the involvement of a Ghumantu gang ,” the SSP maintained.

Areas such as Ghoorpur, Jhunsi, Dhoomanganj and Handia, besides Soraon, have been put under the scanner in connection with the case. “The targeted house is located 300 metre from the Allahabad-Varanasi highway. There seems to be a pattern in the killing that we are familiar with. Traditionally, nomadic tribes strike in semi-urban pockets on city outskirts. They are both brutal and meticulous in execution,” a Crime Branch officer said, adding that recce of a target was often done before a strike. “Nomads are masters of disguise.”

Representative image

INDORE: To regularize students’ attendance, which varies due to mid-day meal in most of the government schools , school education department has come up with an online Students Attendance System.

From this month onwards, the government schools teachers will take attendance of students with the help of a mobile application - mShikshaMitra. The application will help them in monitoring number of students in an efficient way.

The application has been designed in a way that it would be operational even without network since several rural areas across Madhya Pradesh don’t get proper network. The data on the application automatically gets updated once the user comes in network area.

“Until now, schools used to take attendance manually, on register. But, there have been times when the number of students was shown more than the actual number of students just for the mid-day meal,” assistant district project coordinator Narendra Jain told TOI.

Payment to an NGO or the mid-day meal provider is done on the basis of attendance register. So, the number of students keep fluctuating. The online system will address all such malpractice, he added.

The teachers will have to download mShikshaMitra application and with the help of Shala Darpan module, they will be able to mark attendance of students. Principal will verify the information.

With the help of the application, attendance will be monitored on a daily, weekly and monthly basis in every district. Also, required action will be taken for schools with less attendance.

Vijayawada: Nellore police busted a ganja and gutka smuggling racket and arrested six people and seized banned tobacco products and vehicles worth Rs 1.32 crore on Sunday. According to the police, the gutka racket, spread across Nellore, Prakasam and West Godavari districts, would procure banned tobacco products from Bengaluru and supply it to traders.

Nellore superintendent of police (SP) Bhaskar Bhushan told the media on Sunday that one Chekka Anji Babu, a native of Kattubadipalem in Nellore district but residing in Bengaluru, was the kingpin behind the racket. He was earlier part of a similar trade in Chennai but had been arrested by local police.

After his release, Anji Babu shifted base to Bengaluru and resumed trade with his old contacts. He built a network with traders and started procuring gutka products from Bengaluru. He set up two godowns at Nelaturu and Vengamambapuram in Nellore district.

On Sunday, Anji Babu along with five others, brought two truckloads of gutka products to the godown at Nelaturu. Upon receiving credible information, police conducted raids and nabbed all six while the gutka products were being offloaded. The SP said 20 others involved in the network have also been identified.

Apart from Anji Babu, police arrested Tanjavuru Mahendra, Suman, Chinnareddy Rajendra, G Srinivasulu Reddy and Cherukuri Vijaya Kumar.

118,['6/01/2020'],"Home drop facility may go beyond city, says CP","This story is from January 6, 2020

Nagpur: It’s been a month since Nagpur police launched the home drop facility for women, assuring them of safety during late night and early morning hours. The facility was introduced following the Hyderabad rape and murder case after which questions were raised regarding the safety and security of women.

Police commissioner BK Upadhyay, who took the initiative, spoke to TOI about the networking and controlling to facilitate a hastle-free service.

Given its success, the ‘Home drop’ facility is likely to spread its wings to rural places for which the CP is likely to take the SPs on board.

“I received a lot of complaints and grievances from women. Those working late into the night or doing night shifts didn’t feel safe while returning home. Hence, we decided to provide the drop facility,” said Upadhyay.

The top cop swung into action after the Hyderabad case sent shock waves across the country. “I wanted to implement this project soon. It was the need of the hour. We want to extend the facility to rural areas like Khaparkheda, Kuhi, Kanhan and Butibori,” he said.

“Though rural areas don’t come under our jurisdiction, we look forward to communicating with the SPs to extend our service,” he added.

The city police has a network of over fifty vehicles which were efficiently brought into use for the night drop facility. “This service does not require a lot of manpower. We already have enough. We just needed sensitivity for its implementation,” he added.

Generally, people have a negative image about the police. “The project has enhanced the image of the police and helped it to develop a healthy relationship with citizens,” said Upadhyay.

“We have trained our force to prioritize the safety of women. We pay special attention to this cause,” added Upadhyay.

The expenditure part of this project is taken care of by the Crime Prevention Fund. “We have a very strong control room system. Over 30 personnel are busy taking details about the drop location, phone number and address. Our communication lines are always open,” said Upadhyay.

The police department has assured women of a 24X7 helpline. The control room or a nearby PCR/SHO vehicle picks women from their location and drops them home.

“We get few calls from rural areas and also during the day. I think night time is extremely unsafe for women. If a women is stranded and needs help, we are always ready to help,” he said.

The personnel on duty must give all the details about the women availing the service to the nearest police station. “Police personnel must wear their buckles with numbers and name plate on their sweaters in winter,” he said.

On the overwhelming response, Upadhyay said, “This service will be strengthened further and will have wide connectivity.”

Jodhpur: The district magistrate on Sunday directed S N Medical College administration to share the report of infant mortality with the medical and health department every month.

The district administration swung into action after the deaths of 102 infants were reported from two Jodhpur hospitals in December.

District collector Prakash Rajpurohit reached Umaid Hospital on Sunday to take stock of the situation. CMHO and the ADM (City) visited the extended wing of the paediatric department at MDM Hospital.

The administration has instructed MDM Hospital to set up a neo-natal care unit.

Umaid Hospital superintendent Ranjana Desai said most of the infant casualties were cases of pre-term deliveries and handled cases, which were referred to the hospital in serious condition.

She said they had 30 beds in NICU and a proposal for 25 beds for the paediatric ICU had been asked for.

“As far as shortage of staff is concerned, we have been directed to submit details of requirements to the administration on Monday,” said Desai, adding that they have enough equipment and all in functioning condition.

CMHO Balwant Manda assured that 25 resident doctors would be appointed in the paediatric department of both the hospitals to deal with the mounting pressure on patients.

But inspite of mounting infant mortality in the state hospitals, the government does not seem to be serious about ensuring that doctors discharge their duties properly.

A recent report prepared by the Jodhpur divisional commissioner on the directions of the health minister has revealed that the three senior doctors including the present HoD (paediatrics) and his predecessor as well as a senior doctor have been offering their services in private hospitals such as Saroj Hospital, Ankur Nursing Home and Shivam Hospital.

The former HoD has even had his name and designation printed on the patient slips at his hospital.

The report pointed out categorically that their act violated Rajasthan Medical Officer and Nursing Staff Fees Rules 2018 and the report had been sent to the government, but no action had been taken.

Deputy CM Sachin Pilot

JAIPUR: Less than two years ago, deputy CM Sachin Pilot handed over his political seat of Ajmer Lok Sabha to his then close aide Raghu Sharma, who even touched his feet in the presence of the media thanking the former for reviving his political career. The deaths of infants in Kota has put the two at loggerheads with each other. Sharma, who is the health minister, has taken shots at Pilot after he asked for fixing accountability over the deaths of infants in Kota.

Reacting on Pilot’s barb that accountability must be fixed, Sharma fired back that accountability of PWD, which is headed by Pilot, should also be fixed for the delays in the construction work of hospitals across the state.

“Our health officials have been repeatedly writing to the PWD officials for repair of hospitals. The accountability of PWD in delaying the work has also got to be fixed,” said Sharma. He, however, also questioned the elected representatives for not participating in the committee meetings of civil hospitals leading to mismanagement in the hospitals.

Speaking to the media in Kota on January 4, Pilot had said that the government’s response should have been more compassionate and sensitive. He also rubbished the claim made by Sharma of holding previous government responsible for the deaths by stating that, “We cannot escape from taking the responsibility over the deaths.”

Pilot’s statement has sent the rumour mills spinning that Sharma may be dropped from the upcoming cabinet reshuffle. The deaths of infants in Kota has caused national outrage against the Rajasthan government. In the last 36 days, 110 infants died at JK Lon hospital in Kota. Pilot chose Sharma as a Congress candidate in Ajmer bypolls in 2018 and campaigned for him intensively, which contributed to his victory.

Poinguinim: The designated Olive Ridley turtle nesting sites at Galgibaga and Agonda have witnessed hectic activity since the turn of the new year.

In the wee hours of Sunday, a turtle quietly appeared on the Agonda beach and laid 118 eggs, thus giving the beach its second pit that has been preserved by the forest guards on duty.

On January 1, the first pit with 116 eggs at Galgibaga beach was protected after a turtle surfaced for nesting, bringing cheer to the forest department officials.

At Agonda, the first turtle had surfaced at around 4am on January 2, and laid its eggs close to the protected enclosure. Hence, the eggs were not shifted.

Although October to April is considered the nesting period, there has been a delayed arrival for the flippered visitors this season.

125,['6/01/2020'],Incidence of triple negative breast cancers high in state,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Hyderabad: The incidence of triple negative breast cancers has been found to be particularly high in the state as well as across the country (25-27%), when compared to other parts of the world (7-10%).

While this was pointed out in the latest publication of the Oxford Medicine by breast cancer specialist and president, Association of Surgeons of India, Dr P Raghuram, the treatment for the same remains challenging.

The article and his recommendations assume importance as there are only a few experts in the area of breast cancer.

Triple negative breast cancers are more serious in nature due to the fact that they are present in women younger than the average age group, the tumours are bigger in size, grow rapidly and also have higher chances of recurring after treatment.

“These are essentially considered to be more aggressive. Also, since these cancers are not caused due to hormones, they cannot be treated with hormone receptors, which is one of the four treatment options available for breast cancers. In the Indian scenario, overall, breast cancers are occurring at an earlier age (40-50 years), almost a decade ahead of that in the west,” said Dr Raghuram.

The expert pointed out that in such cases, ‘non-adjuvant treatment’ (chemotheraphy before surgery) is given and a multidisciplinary approach is to be followed. “Combining non adjuvant chemotherapy with immunotherapy and a tailor-made approach for each patient is required,” he added.

Dr Raghuram, meanwhile, is the only author from South Asia to have contributed to the Oxford University publication. He also highlighted the life-transforming initiatives championed to improve breast healthcare in India by Ushalakshmi Foundation for Breast Diseases.

KOCHI: A 35-year-old who was going to Malaysia for a job landed in trouble after airport security found about 5g of ganja in a cigarette packet he was carrying. The man was charged with relevant Sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and was let off on bail by the excise department.

The incident happened on Saturday night when Binil, hailing from Ernakulam, was at the Cochin International Airport Limited (Cial) to go to Kuala Lumpur.

Excise officers said that the airport security personnel, who were scanning the baggage, found ganja pieces in cigarettes kept in the baggage and alerted the excise range office, Aluva.

The officers later took the accused person in custody from the airport. The man has to pay a fine of up to Rs 10,000 now apart from the fact that he missed his flight to Malaysia.

Excises officers said it was illegal to possess ganja no matter how miniscule the quantity is. “The punishment varies based on the amount of ganja seized, however, it is illegal irrespective of the amount,” said a senior officer with the excise range office.

He said the fine amount will be issued by the magistrate and it can go up to Rs 10,000. “Usually for the first offence, an amount of Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 is levied, however, there are instances where magistrates slammed up to Rs 10,000 for repeat offenders,” said an officer.

The passenger, who was taken to the excise office on Saturday night, was let off in the morning,” said an officer.

Nagpur: A day after Nagpur witnessed its first youth-led protest of a modest gathering of 80, over 4,000 people came out in support of students. The protesters led a march from Indora Maidan to Samvidhan Square holding the Tricolour and raising slogans against the Citizenship Amendment Act, NRC and NPR on Sunday afternoon.

Muslims community leaders took a back seat and stood among the crowd as students from different disciplines delivered short speeches on the issue. The students expressed solidarity to their counterparts across the country especially at IITs, JNU, BHU, Shaheenbagh, Hyderbad, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh.

Monks from Buddhist community too called for removal of the Act and assured Muslims of “their complete support” till the end.

Students said they have lost faith in the government and demanded a discussion. “We don’t believe them (netas). The PM says something while the home minister contradicts him. Enough of lip service. Let the government discuss these issues in the Parliament and rollback the move,” they said.

The protesters took around an hour to cover the 3.5km stretch during the peaceful march under heavy police deployment with armed cops covering the protesters from all sides to prevent any mischief. The protesters hailed the cops by raising slogans like ‘Maharashtra Police Zindabad’. Slogans like ‘Hindustan ka Samvidhan Zindabad’, ‘Jamia teri himmat ko salaam’ and ‘Hume chahiye Azadi’ were also heard. The voices grew louder all along the way except when it took a pause to pay obeisance in front of Gurdwara on Kamptee Road.

Accusing the BJP-RSS and its students wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) of playing mischief, a student held the mic and said, “Lies are being spread that only the illiterate and unemployed people are opposing the CAA, NRC and NPR. Let me clear their doubts. The youth you heard before me is a law student. One day, he will be a good lawyer and has the potential to be a Supreme Court judge if the country’s secular fabric remains intact.”

A burqa-clad woman doctor said she was a proud mother of four and had come to protect their future. “I want to send the message that if CAA, NRC and NPR are implemented our kids have no future,” she said.

Two Buddhist monks without naming the BJP said, “They want to dent our patriotism. They are danger to democracy.”

MADURAI: Tamil Nadu minister for milk and dairy development K T Rajendra Bhalaji on Sunday denied the argument that the ruling AIADMK had lost some seats in the recently concluded rural local body elections because the party had supported the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). He said the party had lost some seats because of “overconfidence.”

“Former MP Anwar Raja said the party had faced losses because it supported the CAA. That may have been the situation in Ramanathapuram, but not in other districts. We have overwhelming support of minorities throughout the state,’’ the minister said.

Speaking to reporters after inaugurating the Pongal gift hamper distribution in Virudhunagar district , the minister said the ruling AIADMK had bagged many district councillor and panchayat union councillor posts in rural local body elections.

“We consider this election to be a testing ground. AIADMK members were confident that we would win. This overconfidence resulted in losses in some places,’’ he said.

He said each political party should face elections individually to prove who the real hero was.

NEW DELHI: In what it claimed to be a world record, the Aam Aadmi Party government inaugurated 152 mohalla clinics on Sunday. With the inauguration of these clinics by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal , there are a total 450 clinics in the city.

“For the first time healthcare facilities have been expanded at such a large scale in the country and probably in the world. These spectacular development initiatives were possible because Delhiites elected a good and responsible government”, Kejriwal said at the event held at West Enclave, Pitampura, in the presence of health minister Satyendar Jain.

“We targeted to open 1,000 mohalla clinics in Delhi. Due to administrative reasons, work in this regard could resume just three-four months ago at an accelerated speed. Within the next few months, the remaining mohalla clinics will be inaugurated,” he said.

Kejriwal said that though there is no lack of big hospitals in Delhi, common people found it difficult to access these hospitals for treatment of small illnesses like cold, cough, fever etc. “So, we realised that if we start smaller clinics in nearby locations, people can access treatment and medicine without traveling a lot. Also, it will reduce the rush in the bigger hospitals,” he said.

“We are also constructing world-class hospitals in the capital. In the last 70 years, different governments in Delhi built 10,000 beds in government hospitals. Now in the last five years, 15,000 new beds are being added to the government hospitals as the expansion plan is underway and the foundation stone for many big hospitals has been laid,” he said.

JAIPUR: Kota ’s JK Lon Hospital needs more beds to cater to the growing number of patients where three children are cramped on a single bed currently.

In the past six years, more than 1 lakh children were brought to the hospital which has 157 paediatric and neonatal beds. According to a report of the hospital’s paediatric department, a copy of which is with TOI, the facility needs 300 more beds to cater to the paediatric population in Kota, Baran, Bundi and Jhalawar. The hospital has 63 beds in its NICU and PICU. The government has announced to set up a nine-bed neonatal ICU, but that is far from enough. The hospital, constructed on a 40,000 square-metre area, has a large portion of land available where new construction is possible. However, currently the hospital authorities are taking steps to set things in order with existing resources and infrastructure. “The public works department has conducted a survey of the hospital and they have prepared a report mentioning that it requires Rs1.35 crore to repair the existing building and other works,” medical superintendent Dr Suresh Dulara said.

The hospital is planning to increase the number of beds for neonates in the existing building. “We have started work for setting up a nine-bed NICU,” Dulara said.

According to the report issued by department of paediatrics, Government Medical College, Kota, there is a population of 20 lakh pediatric population below the age of 15 in Hadoti region, which requires 528 beds.

Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan

KOCHI: For the past few months, government authorities had been searching for land to set up a cultural complex in the city but in vain.

The centre, to be named after Sohadaran Ayyappan, is one of the 14 complexes to be set up in districts across the state. According to sources, while suitable land has been identified in 10 districts and construction work has begun in three, land could not be identified in four districts — Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta and Wayanad.

“Ideally we want to set up the centre at Tripunithura . We inspected seven to eight sites but none of them were suitable,” said department of culture director Sadasivan Nair.

The department requires 3.5 to 5 acres to set up the centres, named after renaissance leaders and social reformers.

M Swaraj, MLA, said it is quite difficult to get revenue land in Tripunithura municipality. “While one plot that we considered at Tripunithura was found unsuitable because the soil there was not good for construction, another site had to be abandoned because of CRZ issues. We are now exploring the possibility of buying private land at a fair price to set up the complex,” said Swaraj.

These cultural complexes will consist of opera house, cinema theatre, music hall, theatre stages, art gallery, book shops, seminar halls, stalls to sell art and craft and short-term residential facilities for artists and writers. “The project cannot be realized unless we get at least four acres. We hope to find the land soon at Tripunithura or Udayamperoor,” said Swaraj. The estimated cost of each cultural complex is around Rs 50 crore. The total expenditure would be Rs 700 crore.

The detailed project report (DPR) for these centres is being prepared by the agency PricewaterhouseCoopers. “The work on the buildings have started in Palakkad and Kollam, and in Kasaragod we signed an agreement with the contractor last week,” said Nair. DPR for Malappuram is complete and the funds are likely to be sanctioned during the next KIIFB meet,” said a source.

DPR is being prepared for Thrissur, Kottayam, Idukki and Alappuzha. Land acquisition for Kozhikode and Kannur is complete and construction would begin once the DPRs are complete.

150,['6/01/2020'],"After 30 yrs, BDA plans to take up renovation of Kargaina Awasya Yojana","This story is from January 6, 2020

Bareilly: Bareilly Development Authority (BDA) is planning to take up renovation and developmental works at the 30-year-old Kargaina Awasya Yojana, located on the city’s outskirts. The scheme was launched in 1990 with an aim to house around 700 families from economically weaker sections of society. However, it failed to take off earlier.

According to BDA officials, the scheme attracted few takers as a dispute arose over rates of the residential flats and people did not approve of it. Moreover, those who were allotted the flats failed to pay the installments which resulted in stalling developmental works. Now, people have come forward and requested that BDA to take up renovation work to ensure occupation of the flats. A drive has been initiated to take up civic works, including cleaning and declogging of drains in the area, said the officials.

Speaking with TOI, Bareilly Development Authority vice-chairperson Divya Mittal said, “The housing scheme was initiated in 1990 with an aim to house as many as 732 families from economically weaker section. At that time, cost of one flat under the yojana was around Rs 35,000. Later, the housing scheme could not take off properly as people did not approve of the rates and disputes arose. As public response to the BDA scheme was poor, it ultimately affected development works, which were later stalled. As the developmental works were hampered, the place slowly degenerated into a slum area. Now, people, including allottees, are approaching the development authority, demanding that renovation works should be taken up in the yojana. Since locals have begun to show an interest, we are planning to resume the housing scheme and initiate its beautification/renovation to ensure settlement there.”

Asked about its present condition, Mittal said, “At present, only a few families have occupied the flats. Some work related to land acquisition from farmers is also pending. Once it is completed, it will be finalised how much area of the Awasya Yojana will be redeveloped. New rates will be decided and a detailed project report (DPR) will be forwarded for sanction. As of now, we have commenced surveys of the area. Initially, a cleanliness exercise and unclogging of drains will be taken up. Eviction drives will also be launched and people who have illegally occupied the place will be removed.”

The BDA has taken up developmental works in the city in full swing and has been taking up measures to ensure successful settlement of its projects. Recently, development of a “science park” and “forest cover” has also been proposed in Ramganga Nagar Awasya Yojana by BDA to attract home buyers to the housing yojana. The projects, having budget of Rs 3.70 crore and 20 crore, respectively, are set to be completed by 2020- end.

Panaji: Most households in the state have at least two to three vehicles which could be potentially increasing the carbon footprint. While round the clock transport services and affordable taxis are a far cry, the Goa consumer action network (Goacan) is urging people to minimise the use of personal vehicles and opt for carpooling as part of the national road safety week.

“This year’s campaign will also focus on the fuel conservation programme, wherein the concept of pool cars will be popularised. If there are less vehicles on the road, traffic management and road safety will be better. It’s a two-way process wherein you also save fuel besides having lesser traffic. This is also a larger message which will help in conservation and safety,” said Goacan convenor, Roland Martins.

“People can therefore pool their cars to save on fuel. This concept is already there in other parts of the country and needs to be popularised here,” he added.

The national road safety week is scheduled to be held from January 11 to 17. The focus is also on women and senior citizens, this year.

“If they are mobilised and aware, then they can play their respective roles at the road safety committees set up in the panchayats and municipalities,” Martins said.

Consumer clubs in schools and higher secondary schools will also be encouraged to take up road safety activities. Efforts will also be made to reach out to pedestrians to be conscious of the various signages on the road and avoid jaywalking.

“The road safety week is an opportune time to highlight these aspects,” Martins said.

Alwar: Suspected cow smugglers fired at people at Kho village in Bharatpur on Sunday morning when they tried to stop them by surrounding the three vehicles which were being used for transporting cattle. The villagers alleged that when firing started, they alerted local cops but they did not come on time which helped the smugglers to escape.

Villagers said on seeing the crowd, the cow smugglers started firing at the locals. The cops were informed but the villagers claimed that no one turned up and they had to take cover to avoid being shot.

“After the smugglers started firing at us, we took cover because no cops reached the spot despite being informed. We had to run away to save our lives which allowed the smugglers to flee,” a villager said.

Following this, the crowd reached the police station and started pelting stones at the building. Cops had to resort to lathicharge to control the situation.

Bharatpur ASP Buglal Meena said, “After the locals informed us about the presence of cattle smugglers and the firing incident, our team reached the spot and even chased the accused. We have registered a case and have assured the villagers that the accused will be arrested and action taken against them.”

While there have been incidents of firing by suspected cow smugglers, it has usually been at police personnel. In October last year, suspected cow smugglers broke past police barricades and fired at them in Nadbai (Bharatpur). In September, there was an exchange of fire between Alwar police and cow smugglers after a pickup truck transporting cattle broke past police barricades. Although cops rescued 15 bovine animals, none of the suspected smugglers was caught.

People said they were agitated as the company hadbeen leaving debris (from road widening work) unattended. They alleged that the debris had already damaged drains and roads in the region.

Shailendra Bhandari, president of Bhramkhal Trade Union told TOI, “The construction company, undertaking all-weather road project at Yamunotri national highway, is leaving debris from road widening works and demolishing of buildings, unattended. This debris is choking our drains and damaging our roads. Despite several complaints, officials aren’t taking any action.” He added that recent rain spells have aggravated the issue in the region.

Narrating similar inconveniences, another local resident Rajesh Ramola added, “The construction company must repair drains and roads at the earliest. Besides, they should also identify proper places to dump the debris. We will be forced to intensify the protest, if the company doesn’t resolve this issue soon.”

Meanwhile, the construction company officials claimed that the issue will be resolved at the earliest. GS Reddy, project manager of the construction company in question, met agitating locals on Sunday and assured them of resolving the issue at the earliest.

“We will start constructing drains from January 8. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has passed the design of drains. Besides, we will also repair the roads at the earliest,” Reddy said.

Listing the achievements of the Centre, Shah accused AAP of ‘obstructing’ its various schemes in Delhi

NEW DELHI: Sounding the poll bugle for the assembly elections , BJP national president Amit Shah on Sunday said the party will form the next government in Delhi under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Though sources had earlier said that Shah may announce BJP’s chief ministerial candidate, his statement put an end to the speculation as to who would be the CM face in the capital.

Addressing the party’s booth-level convention in a packed Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium , Shah said, “Looking at the enthusiasm of party workers from 13,750 polling booths, I can assure that BJP will form the next government in Delhi under the leadership of Narendra Modi.” He added that he himself would be addressing small mohalla meetings.

The ruling Aam Aadmi Party had been challenging BJP to declare its CM candidate. It had also put up hoardings across the city naming several senior party functionaries as BJP’s probable candidates for the coveted post.

Referring to the AAP government’s record victory in the 2015 polls, Shah said people could only be deceived once. “(CM Arvind) Kejriwal deceived people once. In the next municipal elections, AAP was wiped out. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, BJP got a majority on 12,000 booths, which is a record in Delhi,” he added.

Shah accused Kejriwal of siding with JNU students who had raised the “tukde tukde” slogan by not granting prosecution sanction in a sedition case. He accused Congress of failing to provide relief to the victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and opposing the Ram temple at Ayodhya. He added that it was the BJP government that had provided Rs 5 lakh compensation to the families of riot victims in 1984-85 and sent the accused to Tihar.

Listing the achievements of the central government , Shah accused AAP of “obstructing” various schemes of the Centre in Delhi. Shah said the Modi government constructed the eastern and western peripheral expressways to reduce pollution, expanded the Delhi Metro network, started conferring ownership rights in unauthorised colonies and began redevelopment of slums, but Kejriwal’s party “failed” to fulfil the promises made before the last assembly polls.

“Where are the colleges he promised. I cannot see them even with binoculars. He promised 5,000 schools, but they cannot be seen even with spectacles,” Shah said.

He exhorted the booth-level workers to go to every household with a “photo of PM Modi”, BJP’s election symbol and the achievements of the central government to “expose” Kejriwal’s “lies and betrayal” and Rahul Gandhi’s “anti-national” polices. “The election should not be fought through rallies, hoardings and posters, but by contacting every voter individually,” Shah added.

“As your president, I will visit each mohalla and household and hold small meetings of 100-150 people,” Shah said, asking party workers to ensure that BJP stages a comeback in Delhi after a gap of 20 years.

Speaking immediately before Shah, West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma dubbed Modi as “Bharat ka Laal” (son of India) and introduced Shah as the man under whose leadership BJP won the 2019 Lok Sabha poll. BJP working president JP Nadda accused Kejriwal of “stopping” the launch of Ayushman Bharat scheme, which promises treatment of up to Rs 5 lakh to the poor, so that Modi doesn’t get “credit” for it.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said people will get the benefits of all schemes of the Centre as Kejriwal was going to be CM for just “30 more days”. He accused the AAP government of “destroying” Delhi’s water and air and challenged Kejriwal to stop registration of houses in unauthorised colonies and giving pucca houses to slum dwellers.

HYDERABAD: The red, yellow, and blue push pins — denoting unsafe roads, dark stretches, and bad roads — are growing by the day on the over 20 maps put up across the city. The maps were put up as part of a campaign — Let there be light — where citizens can highlight security issues in their areas by placing the colour-coded pins on the maps.

The campaign by Times of India and Radio Mirchi was launched after citizens raised concerns following Disha rape and murder case, over unsafe roads, and dimly-lit areas, besides pothole-ridden roads in the city.

Suchitra, 25, who works at a Diagnostic centre, said the road near Dhobighat in Lower Tank Bund area which takes her home is dimly lit and that is why she prefers leaving office before sundown.

“The streets get a little dark on this stretch, so I prefer to reach home early,” she said. “I have been staying here for the past year. ...there are only a few street lights on this stretch. I feel a little anxious walking by the relatively empty and dark street.”

On the maps put up as part of the campaign, there are several yellow and red push pins put up by citizens on Lower Tank Bund and surrounding areas. While some raised concerns over lack of enough street lights, a few worried over the safety of women and children on these streets.

“While the area near Indira Park is well lit, there are stretches at Lower Tank Bund, which lack enough street lights,” said S Srinath, who owns a kirana shop in the area. “The stretch near Goshala and Dhobighat is relatively dark and empty after 8pm. There have been attempts of robbery and snatching in the past.”

Locals told TOI that because of lack of street lights, driving at night also becomes is a headache. “There are potholes, which are not visible at night,” said a local. Another resident said, “Roads becomes unsafe for women and children at night. One cannot wait for a big crime to occur to raise these issues.”

JAIPUR: Swachhta Survekshan 2020 is going on and right under the nose of the administration, the ban on plastic bags is being violated.

Strict orders, blanket ban and many notifications have been issued but the use of plastic bags is still rampant. Plastic bags have been banned since 2010 by the Rajasthan government and many times, drives have been organised by the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) and State Pollution Control Board (SPCB), but they do not seem to be having any effect.

Rajasthan High Court in May 2018, observed that the government is not serious about the implementation of plastic ban law in the state and asked them to file an affidavit about the steps taken so far within 10 days.

Most of the street vendors and shopkeepers can be seen selling products in the polythene bags. The only difference these frequent drives have made is that the vendors keep the plastic bags hidden. Vijay Sharma, a shopkeeper at Raja Park said, “We do not keep the plastic bags fearing raids by the authorities but these street vendors do. These street vendors keep on moving or have temporary structures and at the time of raid, throw the plastics away. For us, it is a problem and we have already paid thousands of rupees of fine.”

Vendors in Lal Kothi vegetable market said that customers also demand the plastic bags. “There should be a proper alternative to plastic bags. People come from far away places and prefer to take plastic bags. Cloth bags are very expensive for us,” said a vendor at the vegetable market.

JMC commissioner VP Singh did not answer the repeated calls made by TOI for comment on the story.

A senior official of State Pollution Control Board said that though they have shut down all the plastic manufacturing units in Rajasthan, people are finding ways to smuggle them from neighbouring states. He says, “Our hands are tied because we can only prosecute the culprit, not fine them for selling plastic bags under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, which takes time. There were reports given to the state department to amend laws and give us more power but that was not implemented. We have established cloth bag vending machines in many places of the state and more are in process, but for complete ban on plastic in the state, there has to be a nationwide ban as well.”

161,['6/01/2020'],"Internship must to be a pharmacist, but where?","This story is from January 6, 2020

Nagpur: More than 12,000 pharmacy diploma-holders, coming out of the colleges this year from Maharashtra, may face tough time finding a medical shop (pharmacy) for their internship. This three-month internship is a must for DPharm students to get themselves registered as pharmacists.

As per a recent circular issued by PCI (Pharmacy Council of India), DPharm students must complete the internship only from medical shop/establishment registered with the central council and having its approval for conducting the internship. However, the circular has no mention how the shops will approach the PCI and get themselves registered as internship providers. Even Maharashtra State Pharmacy Council (MSPC) is clueless about how and when the PCI will provide approvals to the medical shops.

“It’s clear that students have to complete their internship from approved shops only. Being a state authority, the MSPC, on its own, has created a database of about 250 medical establishments in the state where these students may complete their internship. But, this list is yet to get approval from the PCI,” said Sayali Masal, registrar of MSPC. According to her, the DPharm students will complete their academic session by May 2020 and then start searching for the internship centres.

Even if the PCI approves all 250 medical shops shortlisted by the MSPC, it’s difficult to accommodate 12,000-plus students as the Education Regulation 1991 bars pharmacies from admitting more than two students against one registered pharmacist engaged in the work.

Abhay Pande of All India Food and Drug Licence Holders (AIFDLH) Association said pharmacies are yet to reply to the PCI circular. “PCI has asked for details such as registration number, qualification certificates, working strength along with willingness to provide internship services. We came to know about the PCI mandate on January 3. Those shops interested in academics will apply for it subsequently,” he said.

Students are already worried as they may face dearth of internship medical stores. “Earlier, students used to approach medical shops attached to government hospitals for internship. Looking at the limited number of such shops, they were permitted to complete internship from any registered private pharmacy. Now, they must approach only PCI-approved private pharmacy,” said Dr Pravin Kamble, professor in a private pharmacy college. “PCI should at least publish the names and numbers of the pharmacies which have approached it for internship services for the benefit of the students,” he said.

A senior PCI official said pharmacies interested in academics should apply for the approval soon. “Hopefully, list of approved medical shops will come out by April 2020,” the official said.

Tweak In The Rules

Diploma in pharmacy students need to complete 500-hour practical training in medical shop/pharmacy

Earlier, they were free to approach any registered pharmacy to complete their internship

Now, PCI wants pharmacies to apply along with their credentials and get approval before providing internship services

In Maharashtra, the MSPC has list of 250 pharmacies interested in providing internship services

But, they cannot accommodate 12,000-plus DPharm students expected to come out from colleges in state this year

Aurangabad: Though the Union road transport and highway minister had ordered the completion of the pending road work of Aurangabad -Sillod- Jalgaon highway “within a week"", during early November, the road remains incomplete.

While the work of the road, that covers the world heritage site of Ajanta caves, has been lingering for around one and a half years now, it is projected that only one side of the road may be completed by end of March.

There have been several fatal accidents on the road. Apart from that, the tourists have to face problems while commuting.

The condition of the road was much worse during the rainy season as the dug-up areas were waterlogged.

Stakeholders from the tourism industry blame the poor condition of the road for the decrease in the number of tourists in the World Heritage Site.

In tweets made on November 2 last year, Gadkari had warned authorities of “stern action” if the road work was not expedited.

“The poor condition of highway connecting Aurangabad -Sillod- Jalgaon has come to my notice. I have instructed chief engineer NH (National Highway) division, PWD (Public Works Department of) Maharashtra & RO (Regional officer), MORTH (Ministry of Road Transport and Highways) Mumbai to take immediate action and make sure that road is in good condition within 8 days,” he had tweeted.

In another tweet, Gadkari wrote. “This is not acceptable. Officer or contractor nobody shall be spared for negligence.”

The Tourism Promoters Guild along with other different stakeholders had already raised the demand for expediting the road work of the highway before the issue caught the attention of Gadkari.

A tour operator, preferring anonymity, said that Gadkari must review the road work and make the progress public through social media. .

When contacted, a senior official from the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) said that around three-fourth of the total road work on one side was already over.

“We hope that one side of the road is completed before the end of the current fiscal year. As of now there are three contractors are working on different segments of the road,” he said, on the condition of anonymity.

The length of the road is around 100km.

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Reacting to BJP national president Amit Shah’s address to booth-level workers at IGI Stadium on Sunday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Union home minister’s speech was a “long list of personal attacks and abuses”.

“I heard the entire speech of the home minister, Amit Shah ji. I thought he would point out the shortcomings of our work and talk about the development of Delhi. But he did not say anything except abuse me. If he has suggestions for Delhi, then tell me. We will implement good suggestions in the next five years,” Kejriwal tweeted minutes after Shah concluded his speech.

AAP’s national spokesperson Atishi called Shah’s speech “evidence” that BJP was floundering in its election campaign with no agenda for Delhi or a capable functionary to lead its campaign. “The people of Delhi will respond to the work done by the AAP government in a befitting manner,” she said.

Atishi said Shah will hear the stories of how people’s lives have changed with the improvement brought about by the AAP government is all spheres, especially in education, health, power and water.

“When he conducts his mohalla sabhas, he should ask people about the AAP government’s performance. The people of Delhi will share the story of transformation in their lives and the benefits that have accrued to them in the last five years in education, health, power, water and other aspects of their life. People will convince Amit Shah of how well this government has served its voters,” Atishi said.

Taking a jibe at Shah’s statement that BJP will form the next government in Delhi under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, Atishi said people were disappointed at the party’s inability to announce a chief ministerial candidate.

“This is a clear indication of sheer confusion and internal strife within the Delhi unit of BJP because different names keep popping up, but the party cannot zero in on one clear face to lead the party. This is an absolutely clear pointer to the fact that BJP neither has a credible face that can stand up to the capability, integrity and vision of Arvind Kejriwal, nor does it have clarity on its vision for the development of Delhi,” AAP’s national spokesperson said.

Atishi also urged BJP to “cultivate and practice positive politics”, instead of spreading “negativity”.

172,['6/01/2020'],Owners still don’t have place to bury their dead pets in Jaipur,"This story is from January 6, 2020

There are more than 35,000 pets in the city, but there is no proper place for their burial or cremation

JAIPUR: There are more than 35,000 pets in the city, but there is no proper place for their burial or cremation . Currently, residents bury their beloved pets in random grounds or throw the carcasses in drains.

According to animal activists in the city, carcasses have been found in Kartarpura Nullah many a times. Swapnil Gaud, a resident of Raja Park, said that they usually bury their dogs in an open land. “We are a dog-loving family and keep our pets like family members. But whenever our pets die, we have to search for a place on the outskirts to bury them. We had even tried to talk to the local crematorium, but they refused to cremate animals there. Our pets deserve a decent burial after living for 10 years in our house,” said Swapnil.

The Rajasthan Municipality Act, under Section 45(h), mentions that city municipality will be responsible for acquiring, maintaining and regulating the place of burial for animals. Officials in Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) said that there have been proposals many times to start this service for animals in the city. Harendra Singh, veterinary officer at JMC said, “There has been a growing demand among the residents to start such facility in the city as the numbers of pets have increased in the last two years. We are thinking of starting this facility in Jaipur. However, it is just in the planning stage and nothing has been decided.” However, there has been a small initiative taken on a personal level by Nipun Biyani, an animal nutritionist from Jaipur. He has started a mobile crematorium — ‘Mloyal Mobile Crematorium’ which is stationed in Durgapura. It was started in September 2016 by Nipun to give the pet owners an option of decent burial of their pets. They charge between Rs 2,500 to Rs 5,500 as per the weight of the animal. Nipun said, “This has given people an option of a decent farewell to their beloved pets. We even provide the owners with ashes after the cremation. Due to some technical problem, we have stopped it but will start it very soon. There should be some step taken by the government to make a permanent facility in the city, which is the need of the hour.”

173,['6/01/2020'],Maharashtra: MPSC online poll to remain open till January 10,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Representative image

PUNE: The online poll to submit the demands of civil service exam aspirants started on Sunday and was initiated by the MPSC Students Rights group. It will remain open till January 10.

Around 13,000 students had given their votes till Sunday evening. The poll includes the three main demands of students — inclusion or exclusion of the Civil Services Aptitude Test (CSAT) paper, separate part 1 and 2 papers and permanent cancellation of the Mahaportal. The results will be shared with the state government to incorporate their demands.

Mahesh Bade, the head of the MPSC Students Rights, said in order to raise demands of students it was not necessary to protest on roads. “With technology and social media it is now possible to reach a larger audience and raise our demands. The poll results will be presented to the MPSC commissioner and chief minister,” he said.

One of the issues the students were fighting for was about the qualification of CSAT and the students had separate opinions about it on a central and state-level.

Bade said, in 2013, the UPSC introduced CSAT and it was followed by many states. “When the students opposed this, a committee was appointed at a central-level and its report revealed that the rural students were at a disadvantage due to the CSAT. Some states continued with the paper, while some removed the subject. In Maharashtra , for the last two years, many students have been fighting for CSAT paper qualification to be granted,” he said.

The MPSC Students Rights surveyed some students who were preparing for the UPSC exam. The candidates said some students did not even qualify the UPSC prelims due to the CSAT at the national-level. So, if the CSAT qualification was removed from state-level exams, there would be a major loss of students.

Kiran Nimbhore, another member of MPSC Students Rights, said they had been writing to the state government from November 2019 regarding the combined examination and cancellation of Mahaportal. The combined exam was conducted for police sub-inspector (PSI), assistant section officer (ASO) and state tax inspector (STI) posts. Nimbhore said, “Many students who are preparing for the MPSC also appear for this combined test and as a result, the candidates who are particularly aiming for these three posts lose out due to competition from MPSC students. Whereas, the MPSC students attempt this test only for practice and are qualified for all three posts. As a result, the MPSC aspirant blocks two seats at a time as he/she is likely to join any of these three posts.” So, a section of the students were demanding separate examinations for all three posts.

NEW DELHI: Rubbishing Amit Shah ’s allegations that Congress “misled” people on the issue of Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and “incited” violence, Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra said as home minister, the BJP national president should know who started the riots during the protests in various parts of the country.

Chopra said if elected to power, the Congress government will not implement CAA, National Population Register and National Register of Citizens in the present form. He added that Congress has always been in support of “peaceful” protests against CAA and condemns violence.

“Our position is very clear from day one. We reject CAA, support peaceful protests and condemn those who diluted the issue by indulging in violence,” Chopra said.

He added that the home minister should also answer why police entered the Jamia campus and beat up students and is now waiting outside JNU where ABVP allegedly assaulted some students. “Why this pick and choose policy? Do you call this democracy? Delhi will never tolerate this,” Chopra said.

Earlier, addressing the press, Delhi Congress functionaries said CAA, NPR and NRC would not be implemented by them. Former Union minister and head of party’s manifesto committee, Ajay Maken, said it would be one of the party’s main promises in the election document, which would be released soon.

“There is a vast difference in the NPR of 2010 and 2020. The Modi government has added six illegal clauses, which have nothing to do with NPR and contravene Article 14 of the Constitution. The new questions included in NPR are linked to NRC. The amended Act has been introduced to divert the attention from pressing issues such as economic distress, price rise and unemployment,” Maken said.

Chopra demanded that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal call a special session of Delhi assembly to make his stand clear on CAA.

Haridwar: A door-to-door campaign to sensitise people about provisions of the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) was launched in the state on Sunday by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Formally launching the campaign from Haridwar, BJP national vice-president Avinash Rai Khanna said, “This campaign was necessitated due to the rumours the Opposition is spreading that the Act will take away citizenship of Muslims in the country.

They are deliberately creating confusion about the Act, which has been made to give citizenship and not take it away from citizens,” he charged. He condemned the attack on Nankana Sahib gurudwara by Muslims in Pakistan. “The act of vandalism exposed Pakistan’s anti-minority mindset,” Khanna said.

Workers from booth-level across the state will be involved in the campaign, which is part of the party’s national programme. “Party workers down to the lowest level, are geared for the door-to-door campaign in all districts. They will fight rumors and clear confusion created about CAA by false propaganda,” Khanna said, adding, “Its sole purpose is to give much-needed relief to minority communities in three neighbouring countries, who have been victims of discrimination and persecution on religious grounds.

Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians have been waiting for an end to their suffering for years. The Act promises Indian citizenship to these people,” he clarified.

In addition to reaching out to each family with their clarification, BJP workers will motivate people to write letters to the PM, pledging their support for the Act.

Khanna added that the Centre has received a report against People’s Front of India (PFI) along with proof. “The report is being studied. Appropriate action will be taken in the matter.”

Kanpur: A major accident was averted when fire , that caught a generator coach of a running train, was doused timely.

The blaze broke out in the generator coach of the Vaishali express train near Etawah railway station on Sunday morning. Luckily, the train staff noticed the fire when the train was about to reach the Etawah railway station. They reported it to the railway authorities after which the station staff doused the fire with fire safety measures. The railway authorities are probing the cause of the blaze in the compartment.

""Vaishali express was heading towards Kanpur from New Delhi when at around 5.37 am on Sunday, the staff travelling on the train, noticed fire emanating from the generator coach"", said Etawah railway station superintendent PM Meena.

The train was halted at the downline of Etawah railway station and the railway staff doused the fire, he said. The fire had majorly destroyed the entrance door of the generator coach, he added.

Later, senior railway officials visited the Etawah railway station to probe the matter.

179,['6/01/2020'],Maharashtra: Footwear trader found dead with bullet wound at Satara,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Police suspect Shewani was pulled out of his sedan and taken to Satara in another four-wheeler

PUNE: The body of the 48-year-old owner of a footwear shop on Laxmi Road was found with a bullet wound in the chest and other injuries caused by sharp weapons at Padegaon village, about 80km from here in Khandala taluka of Satara district, around 10am on Sunday — 12 hours after he is suspected to have been kidnapped from the city by unknown persons.

Chandan Krupadas Shewani’s body was spotted in an open plot in the village by local residents who alerted the Lonand police. An empty cartridge and a note, purportedly written by the assailant(s) in Hindi, were found near the body. The note stated, ‘2 cr nahin diya iske liye bhai ke order pe thokana pada’ (He did not give us Rs2 crore, hence we had to eliminate him on bhai’s orders).

Officials from the Satara and Pune police told TOI that the note may have been deliberately placed near the body to mislead the investigators. They believe there could be some other reason for the murder than ransom.

Shewani, a bachelor residing with his parents and sister at Sadhu Vaswani chowk, had left his shop, Shiv Kailas Shoes, in his black sedan around 10pm on Saturday but did not reach home. His family members called him repeatedly but his cell phone was switched off.

After a futile search late on Saturday night, his sister, Sangeeta, lodged a complaint with the Bund Garden police in the early hours of Sunday.

Deputy commissioner of police (zone II) Shirish Sardeshpande told TOI, “Shewani’s car was found abandoned near Maldhakka chowk. Prima facie, we suspect that the assailant(s) may have dragged him out of his car and used another four-wheeler to take him away. The reason behind the kidnap-murder is not known, but we are probing all angles.”

Senior inspector Shrikant Shinde of the Bund Garden police said, “We have started collecting CCTV footage along the route from Shewani’s shop till Maldhakka chowk to see if we can get some clue about who may have kidnapped him.”

Satara superintendent of police Tejaswi Satpute told TOI, “We clicked photos of the body and circulated them on the WhatsApp groups of different police units across the state. Within an hour, the Pune city police contacted us. We have registered a case of kidnapping and murder besides applying provisions of the Indian Arms Act. The case has been transferred to the Bund Garden police for further investigations.”

TOI visited Shewani’s residence where a relative said his parents were not in a position to speak about the incident. This reporter repeatedly called Shewani’s sister on her cell phone but it was out of coverage area.

The work is being carried out in a phased manner

MADURAI: The city corporation has completed around 60% of the patchworks taken up on damaged roads by the civic body a month ago. While all the bus route roads have been covered, work is going on in interior roads currently, corporation officials said.

The rains that lashed the city during the 2019 monsoons left most of the city roads damaged. While irked commuters aired their grievances, the political party Communist Party of India (Marxist) took it forward by staging a protest.

The corporation collected details of damaged roads, which required patchworks a couple of months ago from all the zones, which revealed that 53 km of road required patchworks. Out of the 53 km, about 30.02 km road was in zone one alone, 9.40 km in zone two, 5.23 km in zone three and 8.06 km in zone four. The works, which started a month ago, are taking place in phased manner. All the key roads have already been covered, giving some relief to the aggrieved commuters. Rest of the works will be completed in a couple of weeks, said officials. Madurai city engineer S Arasu said, “With around 60% of the work being completed, we have covered all the bus route roads. We are now taking up interior roads. The roads pointed out by residents through means of complaints and suggestions are also being considered,” he said.

Residents have also demanded the corporation to lay new roads in the highly affected areas, which include the interior areas. “Many roads in ward 30 and 31 are in a bad shape. It has been several months since the roads got damaged and we have taken the issue to the corporation a few times, but action is yet to be seen. Most of the roads in the wards were laid many years ago,” said P S Laxminarayanan from Sourashtrapuram. Officials said that laying fresh roads will take time as they have to get funding from government.

182,['6/01/2020'],"Wind beneath his wings, city paraglider rules the skies","This story is from January 6, 2020

Colourful canopies float around the hills just off the first tunnel of the Pune-Mumbai expressway at Kamshet. The area is the domain of paragliding enthusiasts appropriating a sense of entitlement as they emulate birds in flight. It’s a series of lows and highs for the adventure-seekers as they ride out volatile winds bent on making them directionless and then latch on to thermal updrafts and currents from puffy cumulus clouds to get a literal lift skywards.

The flyers are attached to the few paragliding training schools operating in the area for the past few years. City-based Vijay Soni (47), a seasoned paraglider with 23 years of experience, runs one of the schools. He has many firsts to his name, notable among them being that he’s the top crosscountry paragliding pilot in the nation and the only Indian to participate eight times in the cream-of-the-crop Category 1 competition.

A specialist at crosscountry, Soni in the year 2000 undertook the longest flight in India in those days from Bapdeo ghat to Baramati, all of 76km, without a break. His present personal crosscountry record stands at 185km done in Spain but other Indians have gone further. The world record is 580km as the crow flies. Improved designs have indeed made paragliding equipment more responsive, enabling the pilot to traverse great distances.

It’s a far cry from the mid-90s when Soni’s decision to plunge into the relatively unknown world of paragliding was triggered only by what he had read in newspaper articles and a few books. He joined flying courses conducted by the UK-trained Rajan Juvekar, also from Pune. When he ran out of money to pay for the courses, Soni took up an instructor post with Juvekar so that he could benefit from the latter’s equipment and also log in flying miles.

In those days, Soni would fly around the hills of Baner where Pancard Club stands today. The area was then untouched by urbanization and he recalls landing and taking off from all sides of the hills, even on what is now an extremely busy road. It wasn’t uncommon to see deer and foxes strolling in the area and a villager ran a lone stall serving idli and tea.

Places like Baner and even Bapdeo ghat are today out of bounds for paragliders due to construction activity. This has pushed them to places like Kamshet and other mountains in the Sahyadri range. At Kamshet too, air traffic control regulations have barred flying beyond a 15km radius and at heights more than 5,000 feet. Before the rules kicked in, Soni had often ascended even up to 12,000 feet.

Every year, Soni takes off to the hills in Himachal Pradesh for a month each in March and November, and for competitions to Europe in the summer. Closer home, he is a regular crosscountry flyer in the hills around Panchgani, which he rates as technically tough and highly challenging due to drifting thermals and strong winds. These hills are far unlike the ones in Himachal, which have thermals aplenty and no strong winds, making crosscountry a breeze for a reasonably good paraglider. Fly in the Sahyadris and one can fly anywhere in the world, he believes.

Soni is now focused on organizing paragliding competitions in India to give our pilots better exposure. He has already conducted four Category 2 events but his big plan is to bring to India the Category 1 crosscountry competition. He knows that will be a challenge because the government is yet to support the sport. In fact, the country’s paragliders were confident of bagging five golds at last year’s Asian Games in Indonesia but the Indian Olympic Association did not care to send a team. Ironically, the Nepalese team, which finished second to Japan at the Games, was trained by an Indian paraglider. Soni says the Japanese too were no match for the Indians.

Soni recommends the sport for learning body balance, calming aggression and building positivity. Interestingly, much like the weatherman, an experienced paraglider will know if it will rain after an hour and end his flight before that, he says. Asked about risk factors, he believes there are virtually none unless one tempts fate by crossing limits. “Otherwise, paragliding is safer than crossing the road,” he says.

187,['6/01/2020'],NITI Ayog proposes linking govt hospitals with private med colleges,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Nagpur: If a recent model of NITI Ayog comes to reality, many government district hospitals in the country will get upgraded into Medical colleges with public private partnership (PPP).

To deal with shortage of doctors in country, NITI Aayog has come up with a plan under which private players will design, build, finance, operate and maintain the medical college with a minimum annual student intake of 150 MBBS seats and also upgrade, operate and maintain the associated district hospital.

This 250-page document on “Scheme to link new and/or existing private medical colleges with functional district hospitals through PPP” was released for feedback from stakeholders recently. A meeting of stakeholders in this regard has been called on January 21 in New Delhi. Meanwhile, experts from medical education and health services gave mixed reactions on the plan.

As per the plan, the district hospital should have at least 750 beds. Of these, at least 300 beds plus 20% of the remaining beds will be reserved for free patients and termed Regulated Beds. Treatment will be provided free of cost on these beds. The private player will be allowed to charge for the remaining beds. For example, if the total number of beds in district hospital are 900, then 300 beds plus 20% of the remaining 600 beds will be regulated. This number comes to 420. Other 480 beds will be considered as market beds. The private player operating hospital and medical college will get revenue from market beds.

Health activists are sceptical of the plan. “This is leading towards privatization of healthcare services. Government hospitals are still only ray of hope for poor patients coming from peripheries to district hospitals. Giving 40% of seats to private operators at market rates will promote discrimination,” said health activist Mohan Karemore from Nagpur.

Dr Pradeep Chaudari, a retired medical officer from district hospital in Amravati, said government should pump more money into healthcare instead of promoting privatization. “In Jalgaon, district hospital was developed as a medical college and it’s running successfully with all government funds. Involvement of private players in government health set up is dangerous,” he said.

Academicians, however, welcomed the proposal initially. “India needs more doctors and for that we need medical colleges. In fact, similar PPP arrangements are operative in Gujarat and Karnataka successfully. If Maharashtra wants more medical colleges, this plan should get approval at national level,” said a senior member of academic council of Maharashtra University of Health Sciences.

NITI Ayog says

* India has a dire shortage of qualified doctors

* It is not possible for Governments to bridge the gap with their limited resources

* This necessitates formulating a public-private partnership (“PPP”) model

* Linking private medical colleges with district hospitals will augment medical seats and rationalize cost of medical education

* Stakeholders are requested to provide comments before January 10, 2020

188,['6/01/2020'],Rule violators enrich railway’s coffers,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The Thiruvananthapuram railway division has earned a revenue of Rs 11.5 crore from penalty between April 2019 and December 2019. A total of 2.55 lakh people were imposed fine for violating rules. During the corresponding period in 2018, a total of Rs 7.3 crore was collected as fine from 1.45 lakh passengers.

The lion’s share of penalty was levied for ticketless travel , travelling without proper ticket, transfer of ticket, excess luggage, misuse of authority, among others.

The penalties are imposed by five squads of around 40 officials functioning under the division. “The increase in revenue indicates the efficiency of the squad. This year, a wider area was covered by the squad. Checking was conducted during peak hours, holidays, festivals and working days after a series of holidays, when it is likely that people travel without ticket or improper ticket. Around 20 to 30 employees at information counters were also engaged for ticket checking when there is less rush at the counters,” said Balamurali M, divisional commercial manager.

The penalty from nine months has also surpassed the revenue collected through the entire financial year of April 2018 to March 2019, which was only Rs 11 crore.

According to a railway official, around 50% of the penalty cases are related to travelling without proper tickets and 40% would be ticketless travel.

“People tend to board reserved compartments with unreserved tickets or travel in higher class with lower-class tickets and get the tickets converted from TTE. The trend is observed in trains towards north eastern region. To stop the practice, we imposed penalty. We also conduct regular fortress checks during which the entry points at the station are closed and passenger movement is permitted through one entry and exit, where the squad checks the tickets,” said the railway official from commercial wing of Thiruvananthapuram division.

BHOPAL: A two-member team on Sunday began randomised assessment of Bhopal’s cleanliness and sanitation status, as part of the Swachh survey 2020. This is the first part of the annual ‘Swachh’ survey, which began on January 4. An elaborate audit of the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) for the same is expected in the next four weeks.

“As per protocol, the team has informed BMC of its presence in the state capital. Simultaneous assessment is taking place in a handful of other cities,” said BMC commissioner, B Vijay Datta.

On December 31, 2019, the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) had announced results of Swachh Survekshan League (quarter 1 and quarter 2). In it, Bhopal was ranked second and fifth, respectively. It is an indicative improvement from the last survey where Bhopal had slipped to the 19th position in the list of India’s cleanest cities.

The locations visited by the survey team were not disclosed.

Anticipating the annual assessment teams’ arrival, like other cities vying for the top spot in the Swachh rankings, Bhopal mayor Alok Sharma has been riding home the message of Swachh Bharat mission. Sharma campaigned on a two-wheeler in Kolar area, braving the winter chill, asking people to stop using plastic. “In the last survey, Bhopal slipped 18 positions owing to incorrect assessment of documentation by the central team. This year, we have been thorough with the process. Indications are that Bhopal will drastically improve from the last Swachh findings,” said Sharma.

191,['6/01/2020'],Dumping of waste affects NHAI work at Akkulam,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: No sooner had National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and contractor KNR Constructions started work on the underpass and service road at Akkulam , as part of the widening of Kazhakoottam-Mukkola national highway, an old menace is back to haunt them. Unidentified persons have started dumping poultry waste in the area, and work has ground to a halt, again.

Last year, too, NHAI had to stop the work owing to recurrent dumping of waste. Though the contractor had several sacks of garbage removed, the foul smell that persisted affected resumption of work. Incessant waterlogging due to the area’s proximity to Akkulam lake also played its part in disrupting work.

NHAI sources said the fresh waste was discovered after work on the service road resumed the other day. “Removing the waste is a tedious process. And the fetid smell is bound to affect the workers,” they said.

The service road and underpass to the Akkulam bridge was planned to facilitate vehicular movement.

After the issue of dumping was raised several times, the corporation launched night patrols to identify the miscreants. However, this was to no avail. In several parts on the stretch, waste dumped into open drains was itself contributing to waterlogging.

With NHAI planning to wind up construction of the underpass, work on the stretch leading to the Chackai flyover, which is nearing completion, could be called into question.

Questions have also been raised about the the location of the underpass, which is prone to waterlogging. Even if NHAI goes ahead with work on the underpass, it will have to take additional efforts to prevent waterlogging.

192,['6/01/2020'],Our healthcare schemes better than Centre’s: CM Arvind Kejriwal,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Chief minister Kejriwal was addressing his sixth town hall at Delhi Technological University

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that the AAP government’s healthcare schemes were better than the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat .

Addressing his sixth town hall at Delhi Technological University in northwest Delhi, a part of his election campaign, Kejriwal said healthcare in Delhi was “free for all” irrespective of their economic background, while Ayushman Bharat excluded those who own a scooter, fridge and cellphones and have a monthly income of more than Rs 10,000.

“Ayushman Bharat can be implemented today itself. But it doesn’t simply work in Delhi. If its criteria are applied, no one will be eligible for treatment. Even the expense of tests, treatment, surgeries and medicines at private hospitals are borne by Delhi government,” the CM said.

BJP has been accusing the AAP government of depriving people of the benefits of the Centre’s healthcare scheme . While addressing booth workers on Sunday, BJP working president JP Nadda alleged that Kejriwal didn’t implement it to stop PM Modi from getting the credit for it.

Kejriwal claimed that the infrastructure at Delhi government hospitals had improved significantly and people could avail of treatment, surgery and various tests free of cost. “Delhi government gives support up to Rs 15 lakh to get treatment for severe illnesses at private hospitals,” he added.

The CM said nearly 1,000 lives had been saved due to “Farishte Dilli Ke” scheme launched by the AAP government in 2018.

He also stressed that there was a need for better Centre-state coordination for effective delivery of government services and schemes to people. “There should be competition as well as coordination between the governments. If we are providing free electricity, the Centre and other state governments should competitively implement such a path-breaking scheme in the entire country,” Kejriwal said, adding that he acknowledges that eastern and western peripheral expressways built by the central government prevent 30,000-40,000 trucks from entering Delhi, reducing pollution significantly.

The AAP government’s agenda for the next five years includes cleaning the Yamuna, improving sanitation, redesigning roads, reducing air pollution, resolving traffic congestion and parking issues and ensuring 24-hour tap water to every household, Kejriwal replied to a question.

On another question, the CM said that free water and electricity will continue for the next five years if his party is re-elected. He accused the Centre of giving “fake” registration papers to 20 property owners in unauthorised colonies. “You have to change the land use first and declare agricultural land as residential. Proper mapping needs to be done for this purpose,” he added.

Members of Sikh community in Hyderabad shout slogans during a protest to condemn vandalism at Nankana Sahib Gu... Read More

NEW DELHI: India on Sunday condemned the ""targeted killing"" of a Sikh in Peshawar, days after the attack on Nankana Sahib Gurdwara , the birth place of Guru Nanak , in Pakistan.

In a statement, ministry of external affairs said Pakistan should stop ""prevaricating"" and take immediate action to apprehend and give exemplary punishment to the perpetrators of the crime.

""India strongly condemns the targeted killing of minority Sikh community member in Peshawar that follows the recent despicable vandalism and desecration of the holy Gurdwara, Sri Janam Asthan, at Nankana Sahib and the unresolved case of abduction, forced conversion and marriage of a Sikh girl Jagjit Kaur,"" it said.

It said the government of Pakistan should act in defence of their own minorities instead of ""preaching sermons"" about it to other countries. The statement came after Pakistan PM Imran Khan tweeted on what he said was the ""difference"" between his government and the Modi government on the issue of minorities.

Repeated targeting of Sikh minorities in Pakistan is seen as the darker face of the Imran-Bajwa establishment's dealing with the community.

The apparently magnanimous act of opening Kartarpur corridor for Sikh pilgrims , is juxtaposed with the Pakistani sponsorship and support of Khalistani group SFJ's Referendum 2020 project, a blatantly anti-India enterprise. India has banned SFJ, a US-based pro-Khalistan outfit.

In July 2019, India handed over a dossier to Pakistan about individuals and organisations based there, who could disrupt the Kartarpur pilgrimage, including by inciting Sikhs towards Khalistan. This occurred after Khalistan activist Gopal Singh Chawla was found to be a member of Pakistan's Kartarpur committee.

Alarm bells rang in India when former Pakistan army chief General Aslam Beg was quoted as saying that ""Pakistan army and the government should create trouble for India through Khalistan movement"".

Thiruvananthapuram: A calendar is a valve that connects one’s life with time. Every New Year introduces us to a variety of calendars that vie with each other to find the most prominent slot on a wall or on the table.

This year too, a host of institutions came up with brilliant calendar ideas. From a tribute to village life by Raviz Hotels table calendar to the story of the city narrated by student clicks in Trivandrum International School table calendar, there are lovely calendars out in the souvenir shops this year.

The table calendar brought out by Raviz Hotels and Resorts celebrates the everyday people of Kerala. The calendar tells the story of people through the eyes of a European traveller Rachel. The stories narrated through paintings include the visuals she captured during her visit to the paddy field in a village, Kappukadu forest, coastal areas, temple rituals, SM Street at Kozhikode, boat race at Ashtamudi, Munroe island, foundry and cashew workers of Kollam.

Ajit Nair, general manager, business excellence, Raviz Hotels and Resorts, said all the paintings used for the Raviz 2020 calendar were recreated after original photoshoots at actual locations with real people.

“Our 2020 calendar is a standing ovation to all the unsung heroes whose untiring kindness and kinship has transformed a tiny patch on earth to be worthy of being God’s Own Country. By projecting a single woman traveller, we reiterate that God’s own country is safe and secure. The calendar is an internal work in line with responsible tourism and we had communicated the theme and idea to Design Team, a Kerala based startup who made the calendar,” said Ajit.

Trivandrum International School chose its students over professionals for their calendar this year. The school had conducted a photography competition for its students studying in Class VII to XII based on the theme Thiruvananthapuram, and the best pictures were selected for the calendar.

The calendar showcases excellent frames that captured scenic beauty of the city and monuments and pictures of daily life of people such as a street hawker, tea seller and a KSRTC bus on schedule.

“We had asked our students to focus on the theme, and the photos should not be edited,” said Sapnu George, executive director, Trivandrum International School.

The Center for Autism and other Disabilities Rehabilitation Research and Education, Sasthamangalam, has dedicated its calendar for featuring organizations that empower persons with disability. Each month introduces one such organization through a picture and brief narration.

The calendar brought out by Leaders and Ladders Group, a management consultant firm, has pictures of 12 world leaders and a brief bio about them. A leader born in the month is profiled on the page of that month.

iClean volunteers celebrate after cleaning 300th spot in Bhopal on Sunday

BHOPAL: Terracotta-coloured walls by the volunteer group, ‘iClean Bhopal’, is something that almost every city resident has noticed. On Sunday, they cleaned and painted walls and beautified their 300th site. On this occasion, Bhopal mayor Alok Sharma , BMC commissioner B Vijay Datta joined the group of youngsters at MP Nagar.

Once the group identifies an area, they clean the place, spray terracotta on the walls, stones or anything that can be coloured and then a tree is painted at the spot. The last motif is an impression of five fingers, symbolising completion of the task, said iClean member Kalpana Kekre. The grouping started as six members and has now grown to a strength of 150. “We began cleaning the street and painting the walls six months ahead of the Union government announcing its Swachh Bharat mission,” said Kekre, who runs a home food catering service.

Others in the volunteer group are youngsters. Tanya Guiung, a class IV student, is one of the youngest of the lot, who dedicates four to five hours every Sunday to clean and paint an identified location. “Cleanliness is important. It also makes the city safe,” she said.

Physically challenged, Biswajeet Mistry is barely 4 feet tall. On a normal day, he works on search engine optimisation, the keywords that search engine algorithms track on web. On holidays, he volunteers to keep the city clean. “I like making Warli art design using white paint on these walls,” he said.

The team members claimed they are self-funded and generate some funds by selling donated scrap. They have spruced up walls along Bittan Market, Polytechnic, Subash Nagar crossing and dozens of other locations.

Officials said that water supply was normalised in most parts of the city by Sunday evening. “It will be back to normal in the higher reaches of the city by Monday. With the additional 10 mld, change will be visible in areas which experienced water shortage,” officials said.

With the replacement of pumps sets and installation of new software, KWA hopes to improve efficiency of the pumps and reduce power consumption. “The 86 mld treatment plant used to pump an additional 10 mld using an additional pump for the past few months. Now, with the replacement of old pumps, the plant will improve its efficiency to 96 mld,” officials said.

In addition, with the use of variable frequency drive, a first in the state, the authority will be able to automatically reduce or increase pumping, according to requirements. “Water from the clear water pump house is pumped to a break-even tank, which overflows if the requirement is low. In such cases, pumping has to be reduced. Also in the morning, when demand is high, pumping should be increased and vice versa at night when requirement is less. Earlier, this was operated manually. KWA will conduct review meetings in the coming days to analyse the impact of new changes,” sources said.

The authority will wind up maintenance work at the Aruvikkara plant over two more shutdowns. The third stage has been planned for January 11, when the functioning of the plant will be haled for six hours. In the fourth and final phase on February 1, the plant will be shut down for 16 hours. In the upcoming shutdowns, KWA will fix standby pumps at the plant.

Representative image

JHANSI: A 32-year-old man was arrested on Saturday night for allegedly murdering his wife in May 2018 and keeping her body buried inside the couple’s home for more than a year in Jalaun district’s Orai .

According to police, the accused Pramod Kumar married Vineeta in 2011. Both of them were native to Orai. The couple started living with Pramod’s parents in New Delhi and had three daughters together — aged 5, 3 and 2 years — over the year. The accused used to earn a livelihood through odd jobs and was driving an e-rickshaw before his arrest.

A few years later, the couple started shuttling between Orai and Delhi, while their children stayed back with their grandparents. They used to live in a house in Ramnagar area near Ajneri Road, under Kotwali police station of the district.

Police said the couple used to fight often and on one such occasion Vineeta had even filed a complaint at a police station in Orai. In her complaint, Vineeta (28) had accused her husband of domestic violence. However, the couple decided to re-conciliate, after they went for counselling at the local Mahila Thana.

From 2018 till this week, their families claimed that whenever they contacted the couple only Pramod could be reached. When Vineeta’s parents used to called him, he used to tell them that she was busy with household chores. Meanwhile, Pramod had stopped talking to his own parents. The victim didn’t have a phone of her own.

After not being able to talk to Vineeta for almost a year, her father Khemraj lodged a police complaint around two weeks back. Police had started investigation, but were yet to lodge an FIR.

The police in turn got in touch with Pramod’s father to find out about his whereabouts. When Pramod’s father was finally able to get in touch with his son on Saturday, the two went to meet SP Jalaun Satish Kumar.

During interrogation, the accused told the police that he killed his wife on May 18, 2018, buried her inside the house and plastered the place with cement. “Since then, he had been changing locations to avoid any contact with his in-laws,” police said.

A police reached Pramod’s home in Orai and dug up the victim’s skeleton in front of the city magistrate Harishankar Shukla. “We have lodged a case against the accused under sections 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code on Saturday and arrested him. We have also sent the remains of the body for a postmortem examination,” said the SP.

206,['6/01/2020'],Litter-free streets turn free to litter streets in Trichy,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Trichy: The novel attempts by Trichy City Corporation to project Trichy as a pioneer in solid waste management (SWM) and to fan behavioural change among residents are gradually losing their sheen. Among them is the litter-free street (Kuppai Ilaa Theru) initiative, in which clean and litter-free streets in the city are tagged with a signboard ‘clean street’ to promote a competitive spirit among residents to keep streets in their area clean. Ironically, the ‘litter-free streets’ have become the most littered streets of late due to poor follow-ups and enforcement.

In September 2018, when the corporation was taking the Swachh Survekshan seriously, it identified 25-30 streets in the city as litter-free streets and had erected retro-reflective blue boards at the entrance of the streets. Plogging drives were promoted in the localities to keep the streets clean. However, 15 months down the lane, the litter-free streets have become the most littered streets in the city making the initiative a mockery. Srinivasa Nagar on Vayalur Road, one of the litter-free streets, has garbage mounds not too far from the ‘litter-free street’ signboard. The situation is no different on Benewells Road, another litter-free street at Cantonment, where at least one tonne of waste is dumped and unattended on the road.

“Waste is being dumped on vacant plots and empty space near the streets. Instead of launching eye-pleasing ceremonial initiatives, the civic body should strengthen the SWM mechanism,” T Santhanakrishnan, resident, Srirangam, said. Out of the 30-odd litter-free streets identified by the civic body, at least 10 streets sport garbage mounds round-the-clock while the remaining streets are littered occasionally, but certainly, the streets were not really litter-free as claimed. Owing to the lapses in the door-to-door waste collection, residents said that they are forced to dump waste on the roads.

“Some of the litter-free streets are maintained properly. We will look into the complaints about the unhygienic condition in litter-free streets,” an official source with the civic body said.

Number of litter-free streets identified: 30

Cost of the project: Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 (approx.)

Nagpur: The authenticity of our city has reached new shores, offering a glimpse of the culture, communities, festivals and people of Nagpur. There are a few who are portraying the beauty of the city and the achievements of its citizens on their social media handles through pictures, stories and videos.

Giriraj Panpaliya and Kartik Saboo have uploaded a page which has pictures and stories of ordinary people. Their aim is to offer a sneak-peak into the lives of not only the elite class but also children playing on the streets, a portrait of young folks and beautiful pictures of senior citizens with wrinkled faces telling stories and sharing their life experiences.

The duo has multiples stories on their Instagram page filled with smiling and happy pictures. “We wanted to make a page where ordinary people can talk about their life. We have stories of a tailor, a hawker, a fruit vendor and even someone from the slum. We have kept our page vibrant so people can relate to it,” said Saboo.

“Our page reflects various personalities residing in our city. Not all of them are high profile, but are heroes in their own way. We randomly meet people, get to know their stories and click their pictures,” said Panpaliya.

A photo page offers a glimpse about a lady selling utensils on the roadside and another frame tells a story about an old man selling fruits. Tarun Kumar runs a photography page where photographers from all over Nagpur contribute. The page is brimming with captivating pictures of temples, citizens, ganesha idols, ram jhula, metro and much much more.

“Each picture on my page reflects how beautiful and vibrant our city is. All the pictures are edited to enhance the beauty of locations and people,” said Kumar.

Apart from the emotional value, there are some social media handles which celebrate the typical Nagpuri lingo in a humorous way. Pages by Aditya Tarale and Rahul Taksande are dedicated to wit and humour which bring out the beauty of the city in a special way. “We run a page on which we post pictures that catch the attention of people. Recently, we posted a humorous picture about the current political situation that tickled many a bone,” said Tarale.

“We want to tell people that our city is different and unique. We get a good response when people tag their friends. Once, we posted a message about making roads garbage-free by not littering them. We make it a point to educate people and make them laugh as well,” said Taksande.

Sharmishta Hardas, who runs a foundation which promotes women welfare, is doing innovate work. On social media, Hardas is highlighting women who are making a contribution in different sectors and helping each other grow in terms of emotion and profession. “Social media has helped me to connect with many women from the city. We organize workshops where women in the age group of 18-21 years and 22-25 years come on a common platform to help each other heal and grow in their profession. Ideas are shared and the aim is to help each other grow mentally and emotionally,” said Hardas.

“I have a page which highlights social issues. Once, I posted a picture of a pillar near a hotel which was ruined by graffiti. The response was encouraging. After that, I started posting pictures of issues to make people more aware,” said a social media user.

One of the best-known landmarks of Bhopal at Iqbal Maidan, is now dumped with scrap

BHOPAL: One of the last remaining signages in both Urdu and Hindi in the state capital was mysteriously cut off and dumped in a dumping yard of the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC). The address is none other than that of Bhopal’s best-known landmark, Iqbal Maidan.

Over the last week, social media messages of the missing sign in the heritage core of the state capital created a buzz. In the midst of conspiracy theories about the reason for the board's removal, Bhopal mayor Alok Sharma said, “If the photograph of the missing board is provided, a new signage would be installed.”

BMC authorities were not aware of the situation, Sharma said. However, by Sunday evening, the board was found at the BMC dumpyard near Jinsi.

The board had been installed by the civic body around 1990 on the pedestrian walkway opposite Sheesh Mahal and Moti Masjid.

Congress corporator and BMC leader of opposition, Mohammed Sagheer, has demanded an investigation into the matter.

Iqbal Maidan, the venue of choice to host large public events, is currently hosting a religious congregation and ‘ satyagraha ’ protests against the Union government’s NRC and CAA Bill.

Some allege that the board was removed late in the night sometime in the past week. Some local residents claimed that the board was cut from the base in the garb of a government drive to clear the city of illegal advertisement hoardings.

MYSURU: Cleanliness is not a one-day process and we should keep doing it, said former international cricketer Javagal Srinath , the brand ambassador for Mysuru City Corporation.

Speaking on the occasion of a Plogathon event organized by MCC along with various other organsiations for the first time at Kote Anjaneya Swamy temple, Srinath, who is the brand ambassador for Swachh Mysuru, said: “Cleanliness is not a one-day process. We should keep doing it. We should develop this habit by speaking to each other on topics which include waste segregation and harmful effects of plastic. If we speak to people for 10 minutes, it is more than enough and for others it will be an inspiration. Apart from our work, we should also give importance to cleanliness in city. It should come from children who are future seniors and take more responsibility. Cleanliness should be a way of life. If this happens automatically, we will be number one in the country.”

He also mentioned that schools and colleges are right places to create awareness .

More than 400 kg of waste was collected by participants who took part in the inaugural Plogathon event.

Humorist Krishnegowda, the brand ambassador for Swachh Mysuru, who also spoke on the occasion, said: “The pourakarmikas who play an important role in keeping city neat and clean are the real ambassadors. We should help them by proper segregation of waste. This cleanliness should start from home and once it is started, naturally we start keeping clean our premises which in turn help us to keep city clean.”

The initiative, which was taken out to promote Swachh survey and increase Mysuru ranking in the national cleanliness ranking, saw a good response.

Health officer Dr Nagaraj said: “During the plogathon event, the participants enthusiastically managed to collect more than 400 kg of waste. Most of the waste was banned plastics which were found on prominent thoroughfares of the road including Sayaji Rao road, Devaraja Urs road, Dhanvanthri Road, Gandhi Square and KR Circle. At the outset, it was very good programme.”

Plogathon is an activity to clean trash along the way as one goes jogging. More than 1,100 people participated in the drive. Residents, members of various NGOs, students from various schools and colleges were also part of the campaign.

Most of the complaints are about stop-skipping and overcharging for tickets

PUNE: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited has decided to increase the number of bus checkers and controllers in the face in a rising number of complaints against drivers and conductors.

Most of the complaints are about stop-skipping and overcharging for tickets. “The complaints take many forms — drivers not halting at some bus stops, passengers being overcharged and missing conductors. There have also been complaints of drivers/conductors misbehaving with passengers,” a PMPML official said.

The bus checkers and controllers are meant to ensure such incidents don’t occur. “Earlier there were just 125 controllers and checkers, which was inadequate considering that around 1,400 PMPML buses are on the road on any given day,” the official said, adding, “Their number has now increased by 341.”

Some drivers and conductors were promoted to the rank of checker and controller.

The checkers and controllers will be deployed at different bus stations and depots. “They will even pose as passengers to check the drivers’ or conductors’ behaviour, the manner in which the bus is being driven and if the conductors are doing their jobs properly,” the official said.

214,['6/01/2020'],Survey for key rail project completed,"This story is from January 6, 2020

The aerial survey was conducted by Hyderabad-based GeoKno India Pvt Ltd

Thiruvananthapuram: The aerial survey to identify the alignment of Thiruvananthapuram-Kasaragod Semi High-Speed Railway ( SHSR ) project was completed on Sunday.

The aerial survey, which began on December 31, was conducted for the entire 532km stretch up to Thiruvananthapuram, as the first step before commencing the work of the project, named Silver Line. The project is expected to reduce the end-to-end travel time across the state to four hours.

The first day of the survey was from Kannur to Kasaragod.

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) aerial remote sensing method was used for the survey, conducted using a Partenavia P68 series aircraft that took off from Kannur International Airport ( KIAL ). The survey is being carried out by Hyderabad-based GeoKno India Pvt Ltd, which had also conducted LiDAR survey for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project.

A joint venture of the state government and the ministry of railways, the project had obtained the in-principle approval of the Centre on December 17. The civil aviation director general, and the ministry of defence had given clearance for the one-week-long survey, followed by the approval from the railway ministry.

“The special permission of the ministry of defence was required since the aircraft had to fly over highly-sensitive security zones, and it is also mandatory that Indian pilots should be assigned for duty,” said a statement issued by KRDCL.

According to V Ajith Kumar, managing director, Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd, the implementing agency of the project, since the survey has been completed, this will enable K-Rail to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) and launch the final location survey soon.

From Kasaragod to Tirur, the Silver Line will run parallel to the existing railway track. From Tirur to Thiruvananthapuram, the line will pass separately from the existing railway line since that stretch has a large number of curves that hamper the speed.

The SHSR corridor is expected to reduce congestion and pollution on the roads, improve safety and considerably save the huge cost resulting from the dependence on imported oil.

The airports at Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi will be connected with the SHSR. It will have 10 stations and a proposal to build short-distance feeder links to connect to other stations too is also being considered. Trains will have a maximum speed of 200 km/h.

Preliminary studies had revealed that the project would be feasible. The state government has been in talks with multiple agencies, including Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), for financing the approximately Rs 56,000-crore project.

BJP's Andhra Pradesh unit's president Kanna Lakshminarayana

VIJAYAWADA: BJP state president Kanna Lakshminarayana on Sunday said the party has taken a clear stand on the three capital cities proposal and will oppose the shifting of the capital from Amaravati .

Addressing the media here, Lakshminarayana said chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy is following in the footsteps of former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu.

He added that the chief minister has no right to take a unilateral decision on shifting the capital city out of Amaravati without the approval of other political parties.

“The state government has taken a foolish decision and the Centre will not intervene in these decisions. We will fight to oppose these decisions as our party is committed to one capital for the state,” Lakshminarayana said.

He added that the report of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) on the proposal replicates the ideology of the chief minister.

Responding to the statement made by BJP MP Sujana Chowdary that the Centre is against the proposal and BJP national spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao that the Centre would not intervene in the capital issue, Lakshminarayana said they have expressed their personal opinions.

BHOPAL: Despite the Supreme Court monitoring committee’s directive that provision of cashless treatment for gas victims should be put in place, particularly when they are being referred to private hospitals in large numbers because of lack of manpower and machines in gas relief hospitals of the state government and Bhopal Memorial Hospital & Research Centre (BMHRC), more often than not the committee has to intervene even to get the expenses incurred by gas victim patient on his/her treatment reimbursed by the gas relief and rehabilitation department.

In its 15th quarterly report presented before MP high court on December 18, the committee referring to its meeting on May 4, 2019, said: “It is submitted that several complaints and grievances are received from patients suffering from kidney ailment or their relatives about non-availability and /or delay in receiving proper treatment including dialysis . After due consideration, we have pointed out that the state government is obliged as per direction of the Supreme Court to provide free treatment for all disease to all gas victim patients and thus to fully reimburse the expenses, if incurred in treatment of gas victim patients”.

Referring to two gas victims who had to get kidney transplanted, the committee said, “Accordingly, it was directed that gas victim patients-- Sabra Bee and Saliha Fatima-- should be provided treatment of kidney transplant and as the same is not available at gas relief hospitals, and the expenses of kidney transplant as well as follow-up treatment thereof incurred by the patient, should be reimbursed.

Accordingly a letter of the chairman of the monitoring committee dated October 6, 2018 addressed to director of gas relief and rehabilitation department in the above context was approved as per agenda item no. 1 of the meeting.”

The committee then went on to direct the director of BMHRC and gas relief & rehabilitation department to make arrangements for treatment of kidney patients who are required to undergo dialysis for the same, necessary steps for providing additional dialysis units should be considered and implemented. “Additional dialysis units have been recommended to be increased at BMHRC as per agenda no. 8 of the meeting on May 4, 2019”, the report said.

In the same meeting, agenda item no. 6 dealt with arrangement of funds for treatment of Mohd. Mukim Quereshi. “As per agenda item no. 6 of the meeting dated May 4, 2019, a letter dated April 10 was addressed to director of BMHRC for arrangement of requisite funds for treatment of patient Mohd Mukim Quereshi. It was further resolved that the director of gas relief and rehabilitation should also be intimated that for such contingencies arising from non-availability of required treatment in the hospitals necessitating referral of gas victim patients to other hospital, contingency funds should be made available for their treatment, so as to provide and make available free treatment without delay and hassles to the patient”.

BHOPAL: Former chief minister Digvijaya Singh emphasised on the need of developing an integrated sports complex comprising a cricket stadium in the state capital. He was addressing the opening ceremony of inter-press cricket tournament held at the Old Campion ground on Sunday.

Digvijaya said that the Madhya Pradesh government has already allotted 50 acres of land in Barkheda Nathu on the outskirts of the city for developing a sports complex, which will have a cricket and a football stadium, alongside facilities for training, hostels and a hotel. It would be a milestone towards establishing Bhopal as a sports hub, he said.

The Congress veteran said, “I have suggested to chief minister Kamal Nath to start the sports complex work on public-private partnership (PPP) model. The sports arena will be a big gift for Bhopal.” He said that he would keep his promise and still work for the constituency and its people in spite of losing the Lok Sabha polls. He also said that he has already started working on his vision document for the state capital.

Digvijaya inaugurated the 25th edition of IES inter-press T20 cricket tournament. MPCA president Abhilash Khandekar, Dilip Buildcon CMD Dilip Suryavanshi, SPG chairman AS Singhdev, IES University chancellor B S Yadav, JLU director Faisal Mir and others were present on the occasion.

Tanker leak caused high tension

Vadodara: Panic spread on national highway-48 near Karjan toll plaza late on Sunday evening after petrochemical started leaking from a tanker going to Surat.

The leakage was caused when another heavy vehicle brushed against the tanker damaging the chemical tank at the toll plaza. Firemen from Vadodara city had to rush 30km to contain the damage.

“We sprayed foam liquid and contained the leak from the tanker but a lot of petrochemical had already spilled onto the drain. We are therefore working on it so that it does not lead to fire,” said fire officer Nikunj Azad of Makarpura GIDC fire station. He added that the chemical is highly inflammable and a small spark could blow up the entire stock of liquid. The tanker contained 30,000 litre of petrochemical.

Firemen had a difficult time during the operation as the National Highways Authority of India refused to stop traffic on Vadodara-Surat lane.

“We requested NHAI officials to divert the traffic to the other lane but they refused,” Azad added.

As the damaged truck remained parked in the middle of the road, traffic going towards south Gujarat was moving at a snail’s pace. Firemen continued salvaging activities till the time of going to press.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: An event within the Indian Institute of Management (IIM-A) campus, ‘IIM-A Stands Up for Democracy’, was allegedly interrupted by police in plainclothes on Sunday evening. IIM-A faculty members have alleged that cops from the Satellite police station had approached them and tried to stop the event citing Section 144. The city police have, however, denied entering the IIM-A campus.

DCP Zone-7, K N Damor, under whose jurisdiction the Satellite police station falls, said: “No policeman including the police inspector entered the IIM-A campus. We did not deploy any cops on the campus as it was their (IIM-A’s) internal event.”

Sources aware of the development said that students of public policy had organized an event only for the course scholars. They were to hold a candlelight vigil, read the preamble to the Constitution, recite poetry of Faiz Ahmed Faiz, and discuss recent incidents of violence in India. The event was to be held at 6pm.

Prof Navdeep Mathur, a faculty member of IIM-A, told TOI: “We told the officials that it was an internal event and went ahead with it,” he said.

Sources, however, confirmed a verbal exchange between the institute officials and police near the institute’s Louis Kahn Plaza (LKP) over a protest event without police permission. The event was attended by the IIM-A community including faculty members. Earlier reports had suggested the presence of students from other educational institutes of Ahmedabad; that could not be confirmed.

The premier B-school had shown solidarity with the student community across the country who faced police action last month while protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Prof Mathur was among those detained during the protest outside IIM-A campus. The incident had triggered widespread support for him, with teachers and students turning up outside the Gujarat University police station.

221,['6/01/2020'],Gujarat: ‘Mama-bhanja’ ATM card thief duo caught,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Nasiruddin Ansari with his maternal nephew Salman Ansari from Juhapura

AHMEDABAD: In a breakthrough operation that might help crack scores of illegal withdrawals from ATM centres, Narol police on Saturday arrested Nasiruddin Ansari, 36, and his maternal nephew Salman Ansari, 22, from Juhapura.

Police said the trickster duo deceived people at ATM centres and stole their ATM cards by swapping them with defunct or fake cards. They used to frequent ATM centres and offered help to people who were withdrawing money. During the process, they noted down the victim’s PIN and then by sleight of hand used to swap and steal the victim’s ATM card. Once the victim left the ATM centre, they withdrew money from the victim’s account, before the person realized the fraud and blocked the debit card.

Inspector of Narol police station, S A Gohil, said they have recovered 56 such debit cards belonging to others from the duo. “We are interrogating them to learn about each case of card theft, including circumstances of the crimes and their modus operandi,” Gohil said.

Police sources said both the accused presented themselves as well-dressed and well-mannered gentlemen whenever they were at ATM centres. Both the accused are residents of Juhapura.

“Once they marked someone as vulnerable, they used to stop him halfway through money withdrawal by saying there is an error in the machine. While the victim became agitated by their intervention, they used to steal his ATM card by swapping it with a fake,” said a police official.

Gohil said the recovery of 56 ATM cards of different persons points at a minimum of 56 such offences. But it is highly probable that they might have committed many more offences and disposed of cards later blocked by their victims.

“We have aired messages to police stations across the state asking them to report cases against unknown persons using similar modus operandi,” Gohil added.

The Tangedco junction box from which flames engulfed Leema

CHENNAI: A 38-year-old woman was charred to death after her polyester nightie caught fire while she was walking past a Tangedco junction box at Choolaimedu on Saturday night.

Witnesses told police that the woman J Leema Rose was engulfed in flames in seconds. They said they heard a small explosion and flames burst from the ground near the junction box as Leema Rose was walking by from her house on New West Street to a grocer’s store nearby while speaking on her phone around 8pm. Onlookers panicked as the woman cried for help, and several minutes passed before someone brought a blanket and wrapped her in it to put out the flames.

Vimala, who was at the scene, said “She just stood raising her arms and crying for help.” Finally people from the grocery store 50 metres away fished out a blanket from their house nearby and covered the woman in it. “But by then she was completely burnt,” said Vimala.

Witnesses said Leema Rose managed to walk to the grocery store and sat in front of it waiting for an ambulance. She climbed into it on her own and was taken to the Government Kilpauk Medical College (KMCH), where she was admitted to the ICU with 79% burns. Leema Rose died on Sunday morning.

A native of Tirunelveli district, Leema Rose was working as housekeeping staff at a private college in Arumbakkam. She has lived in the locality for more than a decade. After her husband passed away, she had been taking care of her 16-year-old son, who had dropped out of high school and was working in eateries.

A few months ago, Leema Rose sent her son to Tirunelveli where her sisters were living. Her relatives who were informed about her death were bringing her son to Chennai.

The area where the fire accident took place has many such electricity junction boxes and residents alleged that they were left open posing a risk to passersby, especially during the rains. “The officials who come after repeated calls, set right the problem temporarily and leave without rectifiying the problems permanently,” said Karthikeyan, a resident of the area.

Tangedco officials who came to inspect the spot said that they were confused about the whole incident and had asked the police for CCTV footage. “There is no possibility of a leak from the underground wire. When we dug into the ground, we found that there was a short circuit in the wire,” said an official.

The Choolaimedu police registered a case of unnatural death.

Jayesh Shah

AHMEDABAD: What started as a small retail business from a 250 square feet shop in Mumbai has now transformed into the second largest wall-clock making venture in the country. Sonam Clock Ltd, now headquartered in Morbi — India’s clock town — is diversifying into manufacture of wristwatches and calculators.

At the same time, the company is continuing with its expansion in the wall clock business to garner a larger pie of the Indian wall clock market worth Rs 600 to Rs 800 crore. The man who stood the test of time is Sonam Clock’s founder Jayesh Shah, who dabbled in wall clock retailing at the age of 20.

“We plan to pump in around Rs 55 crore for diversification and expansion projects over the next few years,” said Shah, CMD and CEO of Sonam Clock.

Talking about his journey, the 52-year-old entrepreneur said, “I started making clocks in 1996 and sold 10 clocks a day. With demand increasing, the production was shifted from a shop in Mumbai to a rented place in Morbi. The very next year, we started making clocks from our own facility spread across 7,500 sq ft.”

Today, Sonam Clock’s production capacity stands at 12,000 to 15,000 pieces a day and Shah wants to increase it to 25,000/day at the company plant spread across 1.50 lakh sq ft in Morbi. The facility employs around 600 workers, of which 90-95% are women.

The company is also a leader in making clock movements (known as the heart of a clock). “We supply 30,000 to 50,000 clock movements. This product’s demand in India is estimated to be 1.5 lakh pieces. We are raising our capacity to cater to 50-70% of India’s requirement,” he added.

The company ended the fiscal 2018-19 with revenues of Rs 65 crore and aims to build its revenue to Rs 150 crore by 2022. It raised Rs 10 crore from the market and is listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE)’s SME exchange. The company, however, is now eyeing to migrate to main-boards of the NSE and BSE.

Till 2014, exports accounted for 70% of the company’s wall clock business and 30% sales were in the domestic market. Demand slowdown in the global market prompted Sonam Clocks to shift greater focus on the domestic market. The India market now contributes 70% of the company’s wall clock sales, and exports contribute to 30% of sales.

224,['6/01/2020'],Chennai: New rule triggers spurt in small apartments,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Greater Chennai Corporation

CHENNAI: Many residents across the city are making use of a change in floor space index rule to demolish their stand-alone houses and construct apartments, making better use of the space and earning more rent.

Data with Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) shows that in the past three months, around 270 applications have been received for house re-development. This follows a rule change allowing increased floor space index for buildings in the city.

GCC brought in the rule change after it was given powers to sanction permissions for construction of buildings for stilt plus three floors. Zonal offices can sanction building permits up to eight kitchens, while at the headquarters, permission can be given for buildings with up to 16 kitchens.

“Earlier, GCC could give permissions only for six kitchens,” said a senior official. This delegation of powers from Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) to GCC has happened in the last two-three months, say officials. This is for areas above 5,000sqft. Permissions for number of floors are given based on the width of the road abutting the buildings, an official said.

GCC officials say this indicates how residents who were living for many decades in stand-alone houses are willing to redevelop and rent it out for residential or commercial purposes. “Senior citizens and families feel the pinch when it comes to maintenance of big houses. Many applications are coming in for houses in residential localities, who have had single houses for many years,” said an official.

S Ramaprabhu, chairman of Builders Association of India, southern centre, said this would give a fillip to the affordable housing segment in the city. “This was a long-pending demand. Though the combined building rules were issued in February, the delegation of powers was given only a few months ago,” he said.

Some corporation officials and residents, however, say this would bring a strain on the groundwater, sewage and garbage collection systems. In a redeveloped building, at least four or five families would be consuming the resources. This poses a risk of groundwater running dry, as most Chennaiites depend on borewells to meet the shortfall in Metrowater’s supply.

Ramaprabhu said the government should ensure to topup facilities, especially in sewage and water supply, as required in areas that saw such increased redevelopment .

A demand to make it free of cost for corporation staff has also been made. The monthly maintenance bill of the project, built at a cost of Rs 5.64 crore, is expected to come in at Rs 3 lakh. Power, labour and other expenses have also been factored in for which budgeting has yet to be done.

The detailed project report has projected four times occupancy on a daily basis, ie, 400 cars at the facility that can accommodate 102 cars at a time. Corporation officials point out that even if the facility can be perceived as a kind of service, cost-based sustainability will be a key factor in the long run.

“Going by present estimates, expenses will outstrip returns. One point being raised is that the civic body has set it up as a kind of social service, but again facilities have to be economically viable in the future or else the service cannot be rendered forever,’’ said an official associated with the project.

Deputy mayor Rakhi Ravikumar said a final NOC from fire and safety is pending and that a final decision on revenue model will be taken at a meeting expected to be convened by mayor K Sreekumar. Officials have also pitched a third-party lease model, with the entire financial responsibility and maintenance being taken up by the party that wins the lease. “If we could work out a lease model which will generate 10% more returns than the actual expense, it would be well enough for the facility to be economically feasible. We may not look at huge profits but at the same time the MLCP should not drain away corporation’s resources,’’ an official said.

A high-powered steering committee had approved the tender bids for MLCPs at the corporation office and Putharikandam at a tender excess of Rs 75 lakh. The project involves a semi-automated multi level car parking system using puzzle parking technology, internal and external electrical installations, fire alarm, fire-fighting system with sump and landscaping and allied works at corporation main office and facility with similar specifications at Putharikandam. The corporation deals with the same challenge at Putharikandam, where the project is being implemented at a cost of Rs 12 crore.

CHENNAI: About 10,000 visitors enjoyed the augmented reality show in the Children ’s Park , Guindy , over the Christmas and New Year holidays.

The park saw a footfall of nearly 60,000 visitors during the holidays, of which one sixth of the visitors enjoyed the show, park authorities said.

The 15-minute augmented reality show, launched three months ago, was thrown open for public viewing only ten days back. “Though the show was officially launched in October last year during the Wildlife Week celebrations, it was not continued. The park authorities sent a proposal to the government about fixing entry fee for the show. The government gave its nod only on December 24, after which it was opened to visitors,” a wildlife official said.

Ticket fare for adults and children more than 15 years old is Rs 50. For those below 15, it is Rs 15. The planned show timings are 11am, 12 noon, 1pm, 3pm, 4pm, and 5pm. However, with the park seeing heavy rush during the holidays, the shows could not be run as scheduled and were instead run back-to-back. “Due to an increased number of visitors, more shows were held than the ones actually planned,” said a wildlife official.

An official said the main reason for the show to be such a hit as soon as it was launched was that it has a variety of wildlife, from reptiles such as anaconda, penguins from the south pole to dolphins from the deep sea, that the children can see, touch and enjoy.

Pune: The newly formed government should not put the brakes on projects like Smart City and Metro Rail started by the previous government.

These projects are important for Pune and any delay for political mileage will hamper the development of the city, Pravin Darekar, leader of the opposition in the state legislative council, said on Sunday.

He was speaking at a ‘Meet The Press’ programme organised by the Pune Union of Working Journalists on Sunday. “If any changes or corrections are needed in these projects, the new government should do it. But just because these projects have been started by the BJP government, they should not be stopped,” Darekar said.

Such steps are going to inflate the project cost and ultimately hamper the state’s development, he added.

Darekar said the newly formed government is ditching citizens as well as farmers. They have not kept their promises pertaining to loan waivers.

“Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray while visiting farmers in drought-affected farmers had given many promises which have not been fulfilled as yet,” he said.

He added that farmers have not become debt free. An overall loan waiver was promised, but only those who have loans worth Rs 2 lakh will be processed. Even that has not been carried out properly, he added.

He condemned the act of arresting a farmer on Sunday when they tried to enter Matoshree, the chief minister’s private residence.

On being allotted a bungalow away from Mantralay, Darekar said it was unceremonious. “ It appears to have been done to keep the leader of the Opposition away from citizens and is likely to create obstacles in the public relations of the leader,” he said.

The Shiv Sena joining hands with the Congress and the NCP was forcing the Sena to make ideological compromises on Hindutva.

Darkear said he will raise the issue of higher and technical education minister Uday Samant’s educational qualifications. There were allegations that Samant had a degree from Dnyaneshwar University, which is unrecognised. “I will seek more information about it,” he said.

Ahmedabad: Does your television receive poor signals during rain or the connection suffers temporary breaks in direct to home (DTH) service? You are entitled to compensation for deficiency in service from the DTH service provider.

The Ahmedabad district consumer dispute redressal forum has ordered a DTH service provider to pay compensation of Rs 1,500 and litigation expenditure of Rs 1,000 to a Vasna resident, Ajay Khandelia. He had complained that he could not enjoy television programmes during rains because of poor reception of signals and the company could not redress his problem.

In this case, Khandelia had been subscribing to TATA Sky package Dhamal Mix since 2013. In September 2017, he sued the service provider at the consumer court after a technician sent by the company could not fix it in July 2017. Khandelia sought refund of Rs 3,290, the annual fee charged for the package, from the company for the disturbances that he faced in watching television programmes during monsoon.

Before the court, the company claimed that a technician was sent and a sincere effort was made to fix the problem. But on rainy days, the signal reception gets poor, and there was no deficiency in service.

However, the consumer court held that Khandelia suffered mental agony, and he is entitled to compensation.

PUNE: There has been a steady decline in the number of cases in which public servants were trapped by the state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) over the past five years, as per an annual report published by the ACB.The bureau had registered 1,234 cases in 2015, while last year, just 867 cases were registered.A senior ACB officer attributed the downward trend to a lessened emphasis on fieldwork.“In 2015-16, the then director-general of police (ACB) Praveen Dixit had taken many proactive steps, including an enhanced focus on fieldwork at various government departments. This involved actively tapping people affected by bribery demands and acting on their complaints,” the officer said, explaining the high number of cases then.Over the past two years, the officer conceded, the emphasis on fieldwork had reduced. “ACB officials take cognisance of only those cases wherein the complainants walk into their office with a specific grievance. This may have resulted in the dip,” the officer said.The police (194 arrests) and revenue departments (190 arrests) accounted for most of the 867 cases in 2019, followed by local-government entities, such as panchayat samitis (90 arrests). A total of 1,177 public servants were arrested for demanding bribes ranging from a few hundred to lakhs of rupees. Municipal corporations and MSEDCL accounted for 47 arrests each. Two jail guards also numbered among those arrested in the year gone by, the report found.Former DGB Dixit stressed on the need to create a sense of trust among the public. “People feel threatened by government officers and hesitate to file complaints against them. In such a situation, if the ACB can win their trust, they will approach them. If there is trust, there will be more cases — that’s what we did in 2015-16,” Dixit told TOI.The ACB’s Pune unit executed the highest number of trap cases (184) in 2019 — arresting 258 government servants — followed by Aurangabad (124) and Nashik (123). Mumbai had the lowest number of cases, at 41.“We took cognisance of each and every complainant who visited our office in 2019 and made an earnest effort to execute the trap cases after verifying the details,” Rajesh Bansode, superintendent of police (ACB, Pune) told said.In many cases, However, in many cases the bribe was accepted by private persons who collected cash on behalf of the government servants, the ACB stated.

BHOPAL: The state BJP awareness drive to support Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) continued in all the district headquarters on Sunday. Party in association with public forums organised a rally in the state capital and launched signature campaign to garner public support in favour of the law.

BJP charged the Congress and other opposition parties with spreading confusion among the public by opposing the Act.

“Minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are victims of religious persecution. Their sisters and daughters are being raped and men killed. The citizenship law is to give protection to all such minorities. Mahatma Gandhi and many Congress leaders had advocated support to those who are tortured on religion basis,"" said BJP state president Rakesh Singh while launching a door-to-door campaign here.

Singh said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah have assured protection to the affected people under the CAA. ""It was Congress, along with opposition parties, who are involved appeasement politics by opposing the law and creating a rift among Muslims and Hindus,"" he said.

The BJP and Jagruk Nagrikta Manch held a rally in the capital in favour of the citizenship law. The rally was addressed by Rajya Sabha member Rakesh Sinha and senior ophthalmologist Dr PS Bindra.

Pune: Eknath Shinde, the newly appointed urban development minister, on Sunday said the government will speed up work on expanding the Metro network in the city.

Shinde, who flagged off the second tunnel-boring machine (TBM) for the underground Metro stretch in the city on Sunday, also said Metro rail projects will be launched in cities like Nashik and Thane, after Pune and Nagpur.

“The government is working on the expansion of the Metro rail corridors in Pune. A study regarding it will be carried out and the work on the expansion will be sped up,” said Shinde.

Shinde also exhorted officials of the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) — which is developing two corridors of the Pune Metro rail project in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad — to complete the project on time and reduce the burden on the city road network. He said those suffering from the traffic congestion caused by a large number of private vehicles will get a respite.

“States that have good transport services develop at a faster pace. The government will carry out traffic planning across the state for the five decades. Promotion and strengthening of public transport will be the key agenda,” he said.

MahaMetro officials said the second TBM had arrived in the city in December, whereupon it was assembled. After testing and examination, the machine was pressed into service on Sunday. Another machine has already started excavating a parallel tunnel, on the stretch between the College of Agriculture and Civil Court.

The machines, which were custom-made for the Pune Metro rail project by a Hong Kong-based company, are of the ‘Earth Pressure Balance’ variety, and excavate up to 10 metres per day.

Work is on full swing on the other, elevated portions of the two corridors. Testing has already started on the Sant Tukaramnagar-Phugewadi stretch.

CHENNAI: This year, 2020, marks the centenary of Great Bombay Circus , but its performers are filled with melancholy. The end of the year could also mark the end of the circus.

India’s circuses were long ago crippled by the ban on exhibition of wild animals and competition from multi-fold options for entertainment at home. Great Bombay Circus is on its last legs. Its ongoing performances at SIAA grounds near Central railway station are the opening sequence of its last tour.

“This will be our last act. It has become very difficult to run the show because of lack of availability of grounds and of government patronage,” said K M Sanjeev, proprietor of Great Bombay Circus. The 56-year-old was thrusted into the business against his wishes by his late father, but has never missed travelling with the troupe since then.

“When I was a child, I remember playing with some of the performers. I was literally raised by them. Some are still with the troupe. It is them I will miss the most,” Sanjeev said.

The oldest member of the circus , Tulsidas Choudary, 74, of Chapra in Bihar, is a little over three feet tall. His zest for life belies his size. “He is a survivor of kidney and prostrate cancer and has been with us for more than 60 years,” says Sanjeev. A decade ago, the circus sent him home after treatment. “But, he came back within a year saying he wants to spend his last days in the circus and die here. He is a true performer, one of a kind,” says Sanjeev.

Sanjeev says the evolution in entertainment has led to a drop in footfalls, but every once in a while they register good numbers in cities, like they did in Pune and Mumbai last year. “In rural areas though, the patronage has become less as people are disappointed since there are no animals.”

Some like Ezhumalai, 52, have known nothing but the circus. “I did not join the circus. I was born into it,” Ezhumalai said. His parents were cooks at the Great Bombay Circus and Ezhumalai was born during one of the shows. His wife Janaki became a circus performer after marriage to support their children.

“Our children stay with my mother in Tiruvannamalai. We miss being around them, like normal parents- taking them to school and seeing them grow up. But, they understand,” Janaki said. As a parent, Janaki’s wish might come true. But, it will come at a cost.

AHMEDABAD: A former film actress and model Janki Patel, 40, presently running an event management business in Bodakdev, lodged a cheating complaint against her husband and two other persons at Vastrapur police station on Saturday.

Patel, a resident of Aurovilla in Thaltej, has alleged that her husband, Paritosh Patel, and property developers, Dhanesh Jain and his father Bhadarmal Jain, cheated her of Rs 1,51,80,000 by not making property documents of the shop which she had booked in her name. But the documents of the shop were made in the name of her husband Paritosh. The shop is located near Judges Bungalow Road in a complex. Janki in her FIR has alleged that Dhanesh Jain and his father used to work as film distributors and for the last 10 years they are into property development. “According to the FIR, Jains asked Janki to purchase a shop in their complex. Janki then with her husband went and selected a shop of 1,265 square feet worth Rs 1,51,80,000 on the ground floor of the complex. Dhanesh took Rs 1 lakh by cheque from Janki and prepared a sale agreement in her name at a notary’s office,” said a police official.

After that, Janki paid the remaining amount in instalments to Dhanesh Jain and asked him to make property documents in her name. However, he kept delaying the work. “Later, Janki came to know that Dhanesh and her husband both are in financial crisis. Janki’s husband also demanded some money from her, which she denied. This led to quarrel between the two,” said a police source. After some time, Janki herself checked at the registrar’s office in Memnagar that the property documents of the shop she paid for have already been prepared in the name of her husband.

Vastrapur police are probing the matter.

(By: Aarthi N)

CHENNAI: The city police and traffic police have had social media pages for almost a decade but are reclusive in its usage. While counterparts in other metros such as Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi post often, updating citizens with traffic alerts, one of the city police’s pages tweeted last in 2017.

With social media serving as a great tool to reach out in bulk, social media penetration of the men in khaki in city is almost nil. With 25k followers, Chennai City Traffic’s last tweet was on July 6, 2017 and the other traffic page, Channai Traffic Alert with 12.8k followers, is updated thrice a week. Though there were tweets about traffic on New Year’s eve, such tweets are not regular for a city that sees traffic congestion regularly during peak hours, say netizens.

Vaishnavi S, a college student said, “These social media platforms are meant for connecting with people. They should respond to a post or tweet immediately. Only then, we will have an interest to post a complaint or an alert.” And this lack of connect is evident in the fewer number of people who follow the pages.

In Bengaluru, Kochi, and Mumbai, the city police and traffic police keep posting useful updates about traffic and crime frequently every day. They share memes and engage with netizens in a friendly manner, making them more approachable. In Bengaluru and Mumbai, the department has separate Twitter and Facebook handles to monitor complaints and to provide live updates. They also retweet and share if they find citizens’ posts useful. Department officers also go live to convey rules and regulations to the public during festivals or protests.

Shivamurthi J, a bank employee said, “Almost everyone has a smartphone . It will be easy for people to know about traffic and what’s happening in the city with live updates on social media pages.”

Ashwin S, an IT employee, said, “I check the traffic on Google Maps and choose routes to reach home. If these city traffic pages are active and update traffic frequently, it will be easier for motorists. They can even introduce WhatsApp groups.”

A senior traffic police officer said, “There is no dedicated technical team to handle and update details on social media, even once in a while. Earlier, cops who were interested and who had technical qualifications were a part of the team.” The department is planning to have a dedicated team to post updates, he added.

Visiting birds extend their stay in the sanctuary depending on feed availability

CHENNAI: To help the birds that have flocked to Vedanthangal and Karikili, wildlife managers are releasing fingerlings (finger-size fish) into the lakes so that breeding mothers don’t have to fly far in search of food.

A senior wildlife official told TOI that the first batch of tilapia and carp fingerlings was released in the water bodies on Saturday.

Range officer G Subbiah said the fingerlings were bought from the fisheries department, private hatcheries and from other sources. They are transported in oxygenated bags to the bird sanctuaries and then released in the lakes.

This is as part of diet enrichment for breeding birds. When mother birds are hatching their eggs, they prefer to feed on fish and insects found in nearby water bodies and farm lands. The natural stocks of prey species gets depleted in breeding season when thousands of birds inhabit a small area.

At present Vedanthangal sanctuary has nearly 9,000 birds, of which about 2,000 are chicks. The mother birds feed on the fish and regurgitate what they eat in pulp form to feed the young ones. It will be a couple more months before the young ones will be ready to fly off to their summer homes.

Vedanthangal’s latest visitors are the painted storks, Subbiah said. These colourful birds are mating now and within the next 10 days, the females will build nests to lay eggs. These birds will stay in the sanctuary at least till April. This again depends on water availability. If the water levels are good and feed is available in plenty, the birds extend their stay in the sanctuary, Subbiah added.

The 74-acre Vedanthangal sanctuary plays host to thousands of birds that migrate from Europe to escape the winter cold. The nearby Karikili sanctuary is spread over more than 150 acres.

MYSURU: The prices of onion, which have touched a historic high of Rs 160 per kg in December, have come down to Rs 80 in the city’s wholesale market. This has come as a big relief to the customers who were forced to do away with onion in their kitchens.

According to wholesale dealers, the prices of onion is between Rs 60 and Rs 80 per kg in the wholesale market. “Onion supply from Egypt has brought down the prices. Supply from Maharashtra has also increased. In the next one month, the price is expected to come down further,” said Mahesh, owner of Vinayaka Marketing, Devaraja Mohalla.

According to retail sellers, an increased demand and a dip in consumption resulted in the drop in prices. “Now we are selling one kilogram of medium-size onion for Rs 80 per kilogram. Small size onion rates start at Rs 60 per kilogram. Earlier, both were sold for above Rs 150 per kilogram. A single onion is sold for Rs 3,” said Nanjaiah, an onion seller from Nanjumalige.

“When the rate was high, no one was coming to buy at all. Even at this rate, customers are bargaining. The price is expected to come down further in a day or two as huge quantity of onion is available with wholesale traders,” he said.

It is not onion alone. The prices of other popular vegetables like tomato, potato, brinjal are also witnessing a downward trend. “As this is the harvesting season, price fluctuation is a common thing,” said Jaya, another vegetable vendor.

Meanwhile, consumers are happy with the reverse trend.

“Onion has almost disappeared from the kitchen. I hope the price will ease below Rs 50 per kilogram,” said Sunita T, a teacher and a resident of Ashokapuram.

According to CK Ganesh, president of Mysuru Merchant Association, who is also the director of Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI), moderate quality onion rate has dipped to Rs 40 per kilogram in the wholesale market. “Only good onion rate is Rs 60 and above.

PUNE: The crime branch on Saturday arrested a 42-year-old man from Hadapsar on the charge of duping a Warje Malwadi resident of Rs15,000 by posing as an Army man.

Rahul Aurn Siddhu (42) had on November 22 last year contacted Hrishikesh Somase after noticing an advertisement of a sale of smartphone posted by the latter on an online marketplace. Siddhu had identified himself as an Army man and and told Somase that he wanted to buy the cellphone.

The police said Siddhu told Somase to come to Ghorpadigaon to deliver the phone and take the money. When Somase went there, Siddhu said he was in a hurry and requested Somase to accept a cheque of Rs15,000.

“Somase took the cheque and gave the phone to him. But the cheque bunced after Somase deposited it in bank,” a crime branch officer said.

Somase tried to contact Siddhu, but his phone was not reachable. “He had Siddhu’s photograph. He went to the Army unit and showed the photographs to the officers there. He then realized that Siddhu was an imposter and lodged a complaint against him,” the officer said.

During the probe, crime branch constable Amol Pawar received a tip-off that Siddhu was involved in a cheating case at Sasanenagar. The crime branch laid a trap and took him into custody. Probe probe revealed that Siddhu had seven such cases registered against him with various police stations in Ahmednagar district .

The police have found the stolen cellphone on Siddhu. A local court has sent him to police custody till January 7.

PUNE: China will deploy its aircraft carrier in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) in the coming years, said Flag Officer Commanding in Chief of Southern Naval Command Vice Admiral AK Chawla on Sunday.

He was giving a talk on ‘China’s maritime strategy’, which was organized by the Indian Maritime Foundation to mark its 26th anniversary.

“The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy has made occasional forays in the IOR from 1985. It had first entered in force in 2008 under the pretext of anti-piracy patrol. Later, it deployed a nuclear submarine for the same purpose. In 2012, it had started deploying its intelligence collection ships to collect signals, electronic intelligence and map the ocean floor. It has been deploying conventional and nuclear submarines in the region from 2013. It had also roped in its surface action group to demonstrate its operational capabilities in the IOR. Considering all these moves, China would deploy its aircraft carrier in the region in the coming years,” Chawla said.

China has been hugely investing in major maritime and non-maritime projects, especially in countries such as Sri Lanka and Pakistan, to build its “strategic bases”, he said.

“This move is a major concern for India as these countries would have to repay the Chinese huge debts and eventually they would hand over their projects to China. Sri Lanka handed over the strategic port of Hambantota to China on a 99-year lease in 2017,” said Chawla, who has commanded the aircraft carrier Virat in the past.

The Southern Naval Commander said “Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)” was a death trap for “small countries” such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and others where Chinese companies had made significant investments in the past few years. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would prove to be a death trap for Pakistan in the coming years, he said.

“Chinese companies have constructed many hydro projects under the CPEC. But, these were constructed at a high cost, almost double or triple the cost of the usual price. Pakistan would have to repay huge debts to China because of this. In fact, it would have to pay China at least 7 to 8 billion dollars every year for a few decades. It would be difficult for Pakistan, considering the present status of its economy,” he said.

The officer also emphasized that the ongoing infrastructure at the Gwadar port in Pakistan’s Baluchistan province would give the Chinese Navy access to the Arabian Sea and it could also use Pakistan as a “cat’s paw” against India.

“But, it would be difficult for the PLA Navy to carry out active operation with full force in the IOR, considering its geographical location and foreign bases at present,” Chawla said.

The officer also reiterated that the PLA Navy had made an ‘unprecedented’ expansion in naval capabilities in the last few decades. “But, it would soon reach a moderate state as it would be difficult for China to incur huge investment on maintenance of its naval fleets and keep building new ships with the current speed,” he said.

Kamal Nath addresses a meeting in Satna on Sunday

BHOPAL: Amid BJP's nation-wide drive in support of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath on Sunday hit out at the saffron party stating the it was diverting public attention through political jugglery. He asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi , before preaching nationalism to Congress, please name freedom fighters from BJP.

""Modi ji are you trying to teach Rashtravad (nationalism) to Congress through citizenship law. I am asking you and the BJP, to name a single freedom fighter from your party,"" said Nath addressing a public meeting in Satna .

The chief minister's remarks came after BJP announced awareness campaigns to support citizenship law.

Nath said that Prime Minister Modi is publicising his agenda but remains unmoved towards the problems in the country. Nath’s attack on BJP came ahead of civic polls in the state which are likely to be held in March this year.

The chief minister also slammed the BJP's intention behind the CAA. ""They are bringing different laws like citizenship Act. A law through which they will demand proof of citizenship. They will ask you to prove that you are a Hindu. Vivek ji (Rajya Sabha member), Nilanshu (Congress MLA from Chirakoot) you (both) are Hindu. What evidence you have to prove that you are a Hindu. You wouldn't be able to provide evidence that you are a Hindu and they will cancel your citizenship,"" Nath raised a query.

Taking a jibe at the BJP pro-CAA campaign, the chief minister said BJP leaders are hopping cities to garner public support. But, they are not concerned about the situation the country is facing.

""What is the condition of the economy of our country? Our country is not getting investment. Youth is wandering (for jobs) all over the country, the farmers are disappointed but, Modi ji does not talk about them. Tell us what are schemes for our youth in MP. Instead, they are busy in organising campaigns to talk about citizenship and to bring several laws so as to divert the public attention,"" said the chief minister.

The chief minister also laid foundation of welfare schemes worth Rs 129 crores and announced that farmers who have been left will be covered under the second phase of farm loan waiver scheme. He said government will provide benefit to all farmers and fulfil all promises made in the Congress Vachan Patra (poll manifesto).

PUNE: Members of the Indian Medical Association ’s state branch have condemned the recent assault on a resident doctor and paramedic staffers of a hospital in Aurangabad and demanded the culprits’ arrested.

A resident doctor on duty at the Dhoot hospital was assaulted by relatives of a patient at the facility on January 1.

“People attacking doctors and ground staffers and ransacking or damaging hospital property is a serious issue. This is culminating in fear among the medical professionals and they are turning towards adopting safe practices. This approach may, in turn, affect the entire healthcare,” said Avinash Bhondwe, a senior family physician and president of the IMA’s Maharashtra branch.

Elaborating the incident, Bhondwe said, “A woman, who met with a road accident, was brought to Dhoot hospital in Aurangabad by some passersby. By the time the woman was brought to the hospital, she was dead. When her relatives reached the hospital, they beat up the resident doctor and roughed up some hospital staffers for negligence.”

He added, “They had blamed the hospital representatives for letting the passersby go without inquiry. It is the Supreme Court order that passerbye bringing accident victims to hospitals should not be held up for inquiry or questioned by the hospital staffers.”

Bhondwe said, “We at Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Hospital Board of India (the IMA’s hospital wing) condemn the attack on the on-duty doctor and staffers in the Aurangabad hospital and demand immediate action against the culprits under Maharashtra State Medicare Act 2010.”

BHOPAL: In a major crackdown on sand mafia involved in illegal mining, the administration set afire a submarine (pandoobi) worth about Rs 25 lakh, boat equipped with powerful suction pumps and pipes. Almost 1000 truck-load of sand is illegally mined in the area daily.

A joint team of revenue and police force raided the sand mafia at Padam Ghata village of Ashoknagar where illegal sand mining was taking place in Sindh river . Atleast a dozen people were involved in illegal mining at the spot. “ They escaped as soon as they saw the police arriving at the spot”, a cop said.

Unlike in the past practice, the team set afire and destroyed the submarine instead of confiscating it. Pandoobi is a jugaad machine fabricated by the sand mafia for deep water mining. The raiding team brought the machine on the river bank and set it afire.

ITBP personnel remove snow from a road in Mussoorie

MUSSOORIE: Saturday’s snowfall brought much cheer for the tourists who enjoyed playing and posing in the snow and also a smile to the faces of shopkeepers and hoteliers who were able to do brisk business.

However, the snowfall also threw life out of gear on Sunday for residents who faced several difficulties. The residents of Mussoorie on Saturday woke up to a white morning but discovered that due to overnight frost over the snow, roads had become slippery. Especially in areas such as Mullingar, it had become very difficult to walk on the steep roads. “The roads were very slippery and many people fell down in the morning. A woman, who was apparently a tourist, fell down so hard that she had to be taken to the hospital,” said Raghav Bijalwal, a resident of Landour. Similar conditions were reported from other parts of the town.

Bijalwan said that residents had to clear the snow and make a passage to walk safely. Residents also reported that in several houses, the water in the pipelines had frozen and they had to wait for quite some time till the tap water resumed. Moreover, supply of essential items such as vegetables and milk was also affected. However, for hoteliers and traders, the tourist rush helped to dispel the winter blues. “A large number of tourists arrived in the town on Saturday as well as on Sunday resulting in spurt in hotel occupancy and brisk business for shopkeepers,” said Jagjit Kukreja, secretary of Mussoorie traders’ association.

Meanwhile, a number of tourist vehicles were stuck overnight on the road between Kincraig and Picture Palace and the local administration faced difficulty in clearing the road and ensuring normal movement of traffic. The difficulties became more obvious as a snow-clearing vehicle of the Mussoorie Municipal Council was out of order.

“We worked overnight to ensure regular traffic movement between Dehradun to Mussoorie. Moreover, the roads near Bata Ghat were also cleared to ensure normalcy in traffic while a JCB was deployed to clear the Mall Road,” said sub-divisional magistrate Varun Choudhury.

However, despite efforts, normal traffic between Mullingar to Picture Palace could not be restored till late on Sunday. Another problem faced by the tourists was that roadways bus service could not be resumed on Sunday. In fact, the roadways office was closed while the tourists found themselves stranded.

Members of the Sikh community shout slogans during a protest in Hyderabad (AP)

HYDERABAD: Thousands from the Sikh community took to the streets in Hyderabad and elsewhere in state on Sunday to protest the attack on Nankana Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan.

Protesting against Friday’s vandalism at the holy shrine, where Guru Nanak, the first Sikh guru was born, people burned Pakistan’s effigy and demanded harsh punishment for those who were involved in the attack near Lahore.

Similar protests were held in other districts as well, including Karimnagar, Warangal and Nizamabad, where there is a sizeable Sikh population.

In Hyderabad, protesters held banners, black flags and had black ribbons on their arms as they shouted slogans against Pakistan.One placard held by a little girl read, “Jago Imran Khan, Jago,” while another said, “Gundagardi Nahi Chalegi”, as the Sunday traffic came to a standstill with men, women and children marching from four different places in the city.

The protesters, including Hindus and Muslims, denounced the attack and demanded that Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan ensure safety and security of the Sikh community living there.

The protest was organized by Central Gurdwara Saheb Gowliguda, Hyderabad, in association with All Gurdwara Parabandhak Committee Sadh Sangat.

“We want to give a clear message to anti-social elements that such act against the Sikh community will not be tolerated at all, otherwise they (Pakistani) will have to face dire consequences,’’ said Joginder Singh Dua, state secretary, Central Gurdwara Sahib Gowliguda.

Expressing solidarity with Sikh fraternity, many Muslim groups took part in the protest to deplore the attack on the holy shrine. “Muslims in India stand by Sikh brothers as they always reach out to us in our troubles. Not only Pakistan should tender an apology to the Sikh community, but also strong action must be initiated against the perpetrators there,’’ said Nizamuddin, a high court advocate, who joined the protest along with others.

“The attack on Nankana Sahib is a cowardly and shameful incident. It is the centre of faith for crores of Sikhs. Atrocities on Sikhs living there cannot be tolerated,” said Harban Singh, chairman of Sikh Gurdwara Barambala, Attapur.

Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: Defending the administration’s action against BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayavargiya for ‘Indore mein Aag’ remark, chief minister Kamal Nath said that Vijayavargiya should decide who to support — mafia or public.

Speaking to media at Satna airport on Sunday, the CM said, ""Kailash Vijayavargiya should decide whether he wants to remain with the BJP or mafia. It is necessary for the youth to follow the ideology of Mahatma Gandhi whose 150th birth anniversary we are celebrating"" .

After Vijayavargiya's video went viral on social media, the Indore police registered cases against 350 BJP leaders, including Vijayavargiya, under sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 188 (disobedience of an order duly promulgated by public servant) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code .

The police action against BJP leaders has enraged the BJP, which alleged political vendetta. The party also organised a protest in Indore and Bhopal against the action. ""The government is deliberately targeting BJP leaders and filing cases against them in the name of action against mafia. The party will oppose every such action and would not succumb to such tactics,"" said BJP state president Rakesh Singh.

Vadodara: MSU seems to be certainly bucking its appointment requirements. In what appears to be this year’s first shocker, the Faculty of Commerce has appointed six engineers as commerce teachers!

Needless to mention, this has also caused some severe heartburn in academic circles in and outside the campus.

Sources said that in the ongoing recruitment drive, six candidates with engineering degrees and essentially non-commerce background were selected and later appointed as teachers in the same department – department of commerce and business management.

The appointments have been made for permanent teaching posts for which the university has been conducting interview process since last couple of months.

Although speculations are rife on the new appointments, MSU vice-chancellor Prof Parimal Vyas said that the the recruitment has been done following due process and in accordance per norms.

According to Vyas, the current norms state that those candidates who have done their post-graduation and PhD programme in the subject concerned and also cleared National Eligibility Test, are eligible to apply for the teaching position in that subject.

The university officials said that the candidates were selected after all the forms were scrutinised properly and based on the recommendations of the selection committee which considered all the educational background of the selected candidates.

Sources in the department said that this has become a common practice at the department which has even earlier appointed candidates with background of other stream as its teachers.

257,['6/01/2020'],Edu board endorses Google Classroom for Goa schools,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Panaji: The Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has asked schools to explore the possibility of using ‘Google classroom for teachers’ to interact with students and for teachers to plan their lessons better.

Goa Board chairman Ramkrishna Samant said that the board was still discussing ways for schools to better integrate such freely-available technology to improve classroom teaching. Google Classroom is a free web service developed by Google for schools, that aims to simplify creating, distributing, and grading assignments in a paperless way. It allows teachers to check all information relating to a student in one place.

The board, in a circular issued on December 27 to higher secondary schools, said that it has “resolved that higher secondary school teachers could try Google classroom for teachers and interact with students by properly planning classroom exercises on the free educational platform.”

With Classroom, teachers and students can sign in from any computer or mobile device to access class assignments, course materials and feedback.

“Goa Board strongly feels that the use of such digital platforms and cutting-edge teaching technology would put Goa state ahead in India. The affiliated schools can showcase this as one of the good practices in its endeavour of effective teaching learning process,” the circular states.

Though the recommendation to use Google classroom for teachers has been made for higher secondary schools, the board has issued the circular to secondary schools as well to expose them to the idea.

The platform allows educators to track student progress to know where and when to give extra feedback. It is believed that such simplified workflows can help teachers focus on giving students personalised recommendations.

VADODARA: A woman living in Atladara will have to spend six months in jail for causing an accident with her car in Akota in January 2018.

The court of additional sessions judge S P Dave also fined Poonam Chothani of Rs 1,500 for rash driving and causing grievous hurt by knocking down an elderly man.

According to the case details, Chothani had knocked down Ashok Mali, a resident of Akota, at the Akota end of Dandiya Bazaar bridge on January 6, 2018. Mali was going to a local office of Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Ltd on his new bike when Chothani hit him from the backside with her car.

Mali had suffered grievous injuries on his right leg and had to be treated at a private hospital, where doctors said he broke his leg. Mali’s son Mehul then lodged a complaint with Gotri police. Chothani was arrested and later released on bail. However, during the trial it was proven that she was involved in the accident in which Mali got injured.

259,['6/01/2020'],Railway can save 9 lakh litre water daily: MSU study,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Team of civil engineering students of MSU which presented the project

VADODARA: Indian Railways (IR) can save as much as nearly nine lakh litres of water every day. This is what a team of civil engineering students of M S University have showcased through their project which was displayed at ‘Techfest’ – Asia’s largest techno fest held at IIT Bombay from January 3-5.

Under their project ‘Self sustaining railways’, the students have shown a way on how the railways can save 8,730 litres of water by setting up sewage treatment plants (STPs) at the stations, installing vacuum bio-toilets in rail bogies and utilising rainwater harvesting systems.

The MSU project was presented at Techfest as part of competition titled ‘Earth Matters: Water for All’.

“With one time investment of Rs 5,406 crore, Railways can save this huge amount of water. The project cost will be recovered in two and a half years.

The profit is immense considering that there will be reduction in usage of water that is brought from the municipal corporation or drawn from the ground,” said Animesh Joshi, part of the team including Mahavirsinh Mahida, Manthan Chudasama and Rajesh Suthar, who prepared the project.

Guided by associate professor Dr Sanskriti Majumdar, the students took Vadodara railway station as its model. “Around 36.6 lakh litres water is used every day at the railway station, a majority of which is drained out,” said Joshi, adding that if the STP is set up at the railway station, around 12 lakh litres, which otherwise gets drained, can be treated and re-used.

Conventional toilets use 10-15 litres per flush. “If we replace them with vacuum bio-toilets, water usage can be reduced to 0.5 to 1.5 litres per flush,” he said.

Joshi dded that the deficit amount can be drawn through water harvesting system as Vadodara’s average rainfall is 95 cm while the station area is spread across 10,000 square metre area.

260,['6/01/2020'],"Denied rental houses, sanitary workers sweat it out for a roof over their head","This story is from January 6, 2020

Coimbatore: At 75 , Kirumi , a retired sanitary worker with the city corporation, is forced to become a ragpicker to help her family members set up a temporary accommodation facility. She has been staying in the housing unit of Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) at CMC Colony in the city for the past 30 years or so. Now that TNSCB has decided to reconstruct the housing unit, there is no other option for her but to move out. However, had other residents in the city not refused to rent their houses to the likes of her just because they were sanitary workers, she wouldn’t have been pushed into this job at this age.

Kirumi’s isn’t an isolated case. More than 200 families at the housing unit have tales of similar sufferings to tell. As they haven’t been able to find rental houses, they are now putting up makeshift shelters on the corporation land adjacent to the housing unit by shelling out Rs 50,000 each.

If Kirumi has turned to rag picking to contribute her bit to lessen the financial burden of her family members, there are others who have pledged their gold ornaments or borrowed money at a high interest to raise the amount to set up the temporary accommodation facility.

“Who would be willing to rent their house to sanitary workers? We are tired of searching for one. Even after decades, social stigma is still attached to the job. Hence, we decided to construct a metal shed on our own. Having a shelter without basic amenities is better than not having a roof over your head,” Kirumi said.

The families of the housing unit have started to construct metal sheds, which are compartmentalized with a thin wall. Each compartment is approximately 16x11sqft big and comes with a kitchen and a bathroom. Its occupants will hardly have enough space to stretch their legs.

Another resident, 65-year-old Palaniammal, said, “We have borrowed from money lenders at an interest rate of Rs 7 per Rs 100. We have already spent Rs30,000 on the makeshift shelter and we need to raise another Rs 20,000 now.”

She said her family was in a predicament. “If we borrow another Rs 20,000, we won’t be in a position to pay the interest every month with the meagre wage that we earn. If we don’t borrow, we would not be able to finish the work on shelter.”

Palaniammal said had they been able to find a house at a low rent or had TNSCB arranged an alternative accommodation for them till the reconstruction work was over, they wouldn’t have been financially burdened like this.

Dhandapani, another resident, said, “More than 90% of the houseowners in the city is reluctant to rent out their houses to sanitary workers because of the social stigma attached to the job. It’s a matter of prestige issue for them – they are ashamed to tell their friends and relatives that a sanitary worker is residing in their house.”

Pointing out that some people’s attitude towards sanitary workers had undergone a perceptible change over a period of time and they were willing to rent out their houses, Dhandapani said they were, however, demanding a high rent.

When contacted, a TNSCB official said each family would be provided Rs 8,000 as shifting charges as and when they vacate the housing unit. “We have decided to start the construction work as soon as they vacate. The plan is to complete the work in 1.5 years.”

It was some 30 years ago that TNSCB moved 448 families of sanitary workers to the CMC Colony housing unit. Without proper maintenance, the housing unit is in a dilapidated condition today.

The Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has asked schools to hold activities that can teach children how plant health protection can help reduce hunger and poverty.

“This is a unique opportunity to raise global awareness on how protecting plant health can help end hunger, reduce poverty, protect the environment and boost economic development,” Goa Board secretary Bhagirath Shetye has told schools in a circular.

Schools have been asked to collaborate with the directorate of agriculture, ICAR, Old Goa, Goa state biodiversity board, Goa state horticulture corporation, Goa Bagayatdar Sangh, farmers’ organisations and NGOs working in the field to carry out the activities.

For nearly half the global population, plants are a primary source of income, on which humans rely on for clothes, medicines, and shelter among other things, the UN has said.

262,['6/01/2020'],Agri dept suggests integrated pest management for coconut,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Coimbatore: The agriculture department wants coconut farmers in the district to implement integrated pest management methods to control rhinoceros beetle and red palm weevil.

The pests are posing a threat to coconut trees cultivated on 92,500 hectares, a communication from the department said.

Red palm weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus) causes reduction in yield and can even cause the death of trees. “Both the larval stage and the adult beetle affect the trees. They bore holes in the tree trunk and eat fibres. If the trees are affected badly, it’s best to cut them down,” the communication said.

The beetles can be caught using a pheromone trap. “An aluminium phosphide pill should be placed in the hole made by the insect in the trunk and it should be cemented using mud,” the communication said. It also prescribed insecticides to kill the pest.

Rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) eats the young unopened shoots from inside and then proceed to eat mature shoots. “This would cause the shoots to become weak and fall off. To control them, manure pits and degradable waste near farms should be checked and ensured that the insect’s larvae are not present. Mature insects can be killed by poking with iron spikes,” the communication said.

“As a biological control mechanism, baculovirus can be used to kill the insects. Tens of these insects should be dipped in the viral solution and released in the field, which would infect other insects and destroy them. Pheromone traps and insecticides are also effective,” it added.

The department had earlier implemented integrated pest management methods to control the spread of rugose whiteflies in coconut trees.

Biodiversity flyover (File Photo)

HYDERABAD: A day after the Biodiversity flyover in Gachibowli was reopened — since being shut for over a month after a car doing over 120kmph fell on the road below — the traffic police on Sunday announced that it would remain shut from 10:30 pm to 7:30 am. The move was temporary, police said.

GHMC officials said that the flyover would be barricaded at night and workers supervising the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) work in the area would ensure that the barricades are placed and removed on time.

Cops said that they were forced to take the decision as despite warnings people were found to be taking snaps at the accident site as well as using it as a place to pass time.

“Traffic is less at night and many people are taking selfies on the flyover,” said Madhapur traffic division ACP A Chandrasekhar.

The decision brought fresh flak for officials. “Instead of accepting the fault in design, the government is warning commuters and has now closed the flyover at night,” said Chekutty Harsha, who frequently travels to Gachibowli.

Mayor Bonthu Rammohan, meanwhile, said that police would monitor speed during non-peak hours too. “Fines would be levied on commuters who cross the speed limit,” he said.

The traffic police also tweeted the guidelines to be followed by commuters while taking the Biodiversity flyover. Maintaining speed limit, not parking or stopping on the flyover and avoiding wrong-way driving were some of the rules to be followed by commuters. It is also out of bounds for heavy vehicles.

Public has also been told to contact Cyberabad Traffic Police on 040-23002424 or dial 100 in case of a vehicle breakdown.

VADODARA: It was a freezing cold Sunday morning. But that didn’t deter over one lakh Barodians from converging at the Navlakhi Grounds to participate in the ninth edition of MG Vadodara International Marathon (VIM) – the city’s biggest annual sporting event. Marathoners of all age groups gathered at the venue by as early as 5 am and waited keenly for their turn to take off in the race.

The ninth edition of Vadodara Marathon was flagged off by state sports minister Ishwar Patel at 5.20 am as the participants for 42-kilometre marathon and within few minutes the 21-km and 10-km race also took off. The event began with peppy songs and soon the atmosphere turned electric as DJs began dishing out the latest Bollywood numbers. A group of women also performed Zumba near the stage to up the energy quotient in the crowd.

Chief minister, Vijay Rupani , who turned up to flag off the five-kilometre run after 7.30 am, was all praises for VIM. “The Vadodara Marathon has inspired other cities to organize such marathon races. This marathon is a true symbol of unity as even the divyang participants too turned up in good numbers,” said Rupani amid a cheerful crowd. He also read out a message sent by PM Narendra Modi and said that VIM’s initiative of taking up social awareness campaigns like girls education and save water is appreciated.

Para athlete and Arjuna awardee Deepa Malik, who has been roped as its brand ambassador by VIM, too flagged-off the race from the dais. Her presence was a motivation for the physically challenged citizens who participated in the race.

From religious leaders and sportspersons to BJP leaders, senior police officials and bureaucrats, many turned up at the marathon to encourage the runners. “I am thankful to Barodians who participated in VIM in such large numbers and made the event a big success. Apart from our volunteers, the police department and civic body ensured that the participants ran smoothly on the city streets,” said Tejal Amin, chairperson, VIM.

From the crack of the dawn, the city roads on the marathon route were blocked by the police so that the participants could have a smooth run. While the VIM volunteers ensured that the runners don’t face any hassles, many onlookers also stopped by and cheered for the participants. People offered water and other energy drinks to the runners who also got a dose of entertainment on the route, thanks to the DJ music and dance.

VADODARA: The managing director of Vadodara Gas Ltd (VGL), who is also the chief general manager of Gail India Ltd, has sought anticipatory bail in connection with the PNG blast in a house in Ellora Park that had claimed four lives in July 2018.

The managing director Ashok Kumar Das has applied for bail claiming that he has nothing to do with the operations of the PNG, yet the police have summoned him for reinvestigation in the case. He has claimed that he handles the CNG division while the PNG operations are handled by the commercial director, who is also the representative of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) in the joint venture.

Pleading innocence in the case, Das has informed the court he fears that the police will wrongly book him in the case. He said he therefore wants the court to give him bail and assured of obeying all the conditions it sets. The sessions court will take up Das’s plea for hearing on Monday.

“""We will be opposing the bail plea not only because the police have issued summons but also because he has not been made an accused yet,"" said the complainant's advocate Viraj Thakkar. The investigating officer is also likely to file an affidavit opposing Das’s bail application.

Das, along with the commercial directors and directors of the joint venture company of Gail India Ltd and VMC have been summoned by the investigating officer for their statements related to the case.

None of them have been named as accused in the case yet, police said.

The case pertains to the death of four employees of a pizza restaurant at a rented house in Ellora Park in July 2018. The four had died in the blast triggered by lighting of a mosquito repellent coil. Apparently, VGL had not snapped the gas connection even as the owner had initiated process of disconnection in 2010.

The owner of the pizza restaurant had lodged complaint of culpable homicide not amounting to murder following which lower executives of the company were held and chargesheeted. However, last month the restaurant owner appealed to the court for reinvestigation as the police had not taken into consideration the role of senior officials.

JAIPUR: Three more infants died at Kota ’s J K Lon hospital, taking the death toll to 110 in the past 36 days.

A day after deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot visited the facility — which falls under Kota government medical college (GMC) — and advocated to fix responsibility for the infant deaths, there were reports of replacing the paediatric department head Amritlal Bairwa.

Dr Vijay Sardana, principal and controller of Kota GMC, however, denied the reports. “We have not received any such information from the government about J K Lon’s paediatrics HoD being replaced,” he told TOI on Sunday.

After the infant deaths came to light in the last week of December, the hospital hurriedly removed its medical superintendent, Dr H L Meena, from his post and appointed Dr Suresh Dulara in his place. Dr Dulara said, “Dr Bairwa has not completed his two-year tenure as the paediatrics HoD yet.” The investigation report issued by the facility even gave a clean chit to its staff, citing that the children who had died were already critical.

The infant deaths not only brought to light that at least 50% of the life-saving equipment at the hospital was lying defunct but also highlighted that the place was reeling under staff shortage.

A letter issued by the hospital’s paediatrics department to the Kota GMC mentioned that out of 33 sanctioned posts — professor, associate professor, assistant professor, senior resident, resident doctor and junior postgraduate — nine are lying vacant. Two out of three professor posts and all four associate professor posts are vacant, while two posts of senior resident and one resident doctor post are yet to be filled.

With over 100 infant deaths leading to massive outrage, the GMC made arrangements to fill the vacant posts and deployed more doctors at the hospital’s paediatric department to tackle the crisis. “One professor and four assistant professors have been added to the existing healthcare staff,” said Dr Sardana.

The letter was issued on November 22, 2019, ahead of MCI’s inspection for the first renewal of permission for increasing MBBS seats at the GMC from 150 to 250 in 2020-21.

Coimbatore: While it’s the duty of block education officers to send textbooks directly to schools, a group of government schoolteachers said that they were made to collect third term textbooks for classes up to eighth that were distributed recently.

Though the State government gives fund to the school education department to send the books to schools, officials asked them to collect the books in person, the teachers said. It caused inconvenience as teachers from rural areas had to travel long distances to collect them.

A teacher from the Pollachi education district said block education officers have been asking them to collect the textbooks in person. “Teachers shouldn’t be asked to do his job. While some teachers from a panchayat union in Pollachi questioned the move, the official sent the books only to that region. But in other areas, teachers had to go and collect the books themselves. While the State gives fund to the department to distribute books to schools directly, we are being made to collect them in person,” she told TOI.

An official of the school education department said they had asked some teachers or any other authority from schools to come and collect the books to ensure accountability. “If we send the books in trucks, we don’t know whether they would reach the schools safe. There were instances when the truck drivers reached some school to find no one there to collect the books. We wanted to avoid such hassles. We pay for the logistics,” said the official.

Meanwhile, the teachers said the distribution system is full of hassles. “The books and notebooks don’t arrive at one go. Several times, we have to travel at least 10 times to get the books that arrive late. This causes severe inconvenience,” said a government schoolteacher, who is a member of the Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers Association (TNHHSSGTA).

HYDERABAD: Over 2,000 candidates, who had contested urban local body (ULB) polls in 2014 and GHMC elections in 2016 but failed to submit their election expenditure, have been debarred from contest for three years by the Telangana State Election Commission (SEC). A majority of them cannot contest the ensuing municipal polls on January 22.

“This is the highest number of candidates to be disqualified from contesting any elections for three years after the formation of Telangana,” SEC secretary Ashok Kumar told TOI on Sunday. A majority of these candidates had contested as independent aspirants.

Incidentally, the disqualification period of a majority of these candidates ends between March 14, 2020, and December 26, 2020. Also, the three-year disqualification period of nearly 150 candidates concluded on December 30, 2019, and now they could contest the ensuing polls to 120 municipalities and 10 municipal corporations.

Several debarred candidates, whose three-year moratorium is scheduled to expire between March and December, have gone to the high court and got stay order. “Those who got stay orders are eligible to contest the ensuing municipal polls. However, if the court order does not come in their favour, they would be disqualified even if they are elected,” said an SEC official.

The disqualified candidates have been debarred from contesting any municipal election in Telangana for three years from their date of disqualification. Though the results of ULB elections in Telangana region were declared in May 2014 and that of GHMC in February 2016, the process to disqualifying them took time.

“There is a procedure to be followed. It took time for submission of report on candidates from respective district election officers. This was followed by issuing notices to the candidates and waiting for their responses. As per rules, the candidates are supposed to submit their election expenditure within 45 days from the date of declaration of results,” a senior SEC official said.

Earlier, over 400 candidates were debarred from contesting polls ahead of GHMC elections in 2016. Though a large number of candidates were debarred from contesting elections in the undivided Andhra Pradesh, the number was never so high from Telangana region.

269,['6/01/2020'],DMK and AIADMK now fight it out for top panchayat posts,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Tirupur: The DMK might have won the first round of battle in the rural civic polls, but the party is still facing a challenge - in several panchayat unions it will have to depend on independent candidates, who decide the fate of panchayat union chairman and vice-chairman posts. In some cases, like that of Palladam panchayat union, the situation is even worse.

In Palladam, despite winning seven of the 13 panchayat councillor seats, the party is facing a challenge in getting its member elected to the post of panchayat union chairman. Here, the chairman post is reserved for a scheduled caste (SC) woman. while the DMK does not have an SC woman councillor, who could be elevated to the chairman post, the AIADMK, which won only six seats, has an SC woman councillor.

Besides hectic behind the scene parleys, the DMK is also gearing up for a legal battle to claim the chairperson’s post. The party said its member D Thenmozhi was a scheduled tribe candidate, who could be posted in the place of a scheduled caste.

“There is a provision to elect a scheduled tribe (ST) candidate in the place of a scheduled caste candidate. If the ruling party opposes, we will approach the court,’’ said a DMK functionary, requesting anonymity.

However, the AIADMK is determined to stop the DMK. While Palladam MLA A Natarajan agreed that an ST candidate could contest the post, he said there were other discrepancies. “There is a charge that Thenmozhi has two votes. We will verify that and object her election itself,” the AIADMK MLA said.

In Kundadam panchayat union, of the15 councillor posts the AIADMK and the DMK have won 7 seats each. The remaining seat was won by DMDK member independent C Kuppusamy. Both the parties are now trying to woo him as he is the deciding factor.

AIADMK sources said Kuppusamy was in talks with them and that he was demanding the chairman post. The DMK, meanwhile, said it was hopeful of roping him in.

In Kangeyam, though the DMK won one seat less than the AIADMK, the party has obtained the support of an independent candidate and is in an equal position to stake claim for the chairman’s post. Not willing to let go of the chairman’s post, the DMK has opened negotiations with another independent candidate to gain majority.

270,['6/01/2020'],Were sailors lured by woman from B’luru?,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Most of the sailors arrested recently on charges of espionage were allegedly trapped by a woman from Bengaluru. She is believed to have made video calls to the navy employees and lured them with her beauty. Police, however, suspect that the woman was making calls from Dubai though her caller ID location showed Bengaluru.

On December 20, seven sailors — three each from Eastern Naval Command (ENC) and Western Naval Command (WNC), and one from Karwar — were taken into custody by AP intelligence police, after being tipped off by the NIA and Intelligence Bureau officials. Most of the arrested sailors hail from Rajasthan and were ‘honey-trapped’ by the same woman, sources said.

The woman, who called herself Divya, is aged between 22 to 25 years. She allegedly contacted the sailors through social media and was also friends of the accused on Facebook. She had come into contact with the sailors six months prior to their arrests. “The woman asked them to download an unknown application on their mobiles for better audio and video phone connection through WhatsApp,” said a cop.

He said Divya initially sent some photographs and later started video chat with the accused. One of the accused reportedly told the investigating agencies he confirmed her friend request after finding that several other sailors were in her friends’ list on Facebook. She started asking about location of warships, movement of submarines and other sensitive and classified information from the sailors after gaining their confidence.

LUCKNOW: A police constable facing charges of fraud and forgery was booked for disobeying court’s order on Sunday.

A non-bailable warrant was issued by the court when he failed to appear for several hearings.

The case was lodged at Mahanagar police station when the accused constable did not appear before the court even after the non-bailable warrant issued against him.

As per the FIR lodged by Mahanagar police sub-inspector Abhay Pratap Singh, constable Dayaram Yadav, a native of Jaunpur, had duped one Shailesh Yadav in 2018 of Rs 12 lakh by promising him a government job and had signed an agreement on a stamp paper to return the money if he was not able to fulfil his promise.

When he did not return the money, Shailesh lodged the FIR against him. Now, another FIR has been lodged for not honouring the court order.

Visakhapatnam: The Aadhaar number is no longer mandatory submission for people applying for tatkal passports at the Visakhapatnam regional office. The decision was taken after the ministry of external affairs amended the procedure of obtaining tatkal passports.

The process of application was amended following a Supreme Court verdict.

“Aadhaar is no longer mandatory to obtain passports under the tatkal scheme. Applicants can submit any three of the 14 prescribed documents,” a senior official informed.

Earlier, it was mandatory for people to submit their Aadhaar number and two other documents to provide evidence of their residential address as per section 218 of the Passport Act.

People who did not have the Aadhar were required to apply and provide their application number to apply for tatkal passports.

Officials of the regional passport office said that subject to all other checks, the tatkal passport is issued within three days.

While a regular application for a passport costs the applicant Rs 1,500, an applicant has to pay an additional Rs 2,000 taking the total amount to Rs 3,500.

P Velu, an autorickshaw driver from Gandhi Nagar, said, “More than 10 bicycles from as many houses in Gandhi Nagar and EB Colony have been stolen in the past couple of months. People have lodged complaints with the 15 Velampalayam police but they haven’t even registered any first information report (FIR) on the same so far.”

He said some thefts were committed by the same person. “With the help of CCTV footages collected from the area, we could understand that at least two thefts were committed by the same person. We have informed police about it.”

On December 30, Velu said, a police team on patrol had caught a man while he was riding a bicycle on TTP Mill Road in Periyar Colony. “He matched that of the man who was seen in the CCTV footage. But we heard that he was let off later.”

A police officer said, “We usually do not register FIR immediately for bicycle thefts. We, however, provide the complainants a community service register. We have been investigating the theft complaints and we hope to solve them soon.”

The seven friends work for a software company in the city and are passionate about cricket

BENGALURU: Several homeless people, sleeping on the pavements of KR Market area on Friday night, woke up to a warm surprise. They had been covered in blankets, thanks to a group of youngsters, who were going around the area gifting them to the needy.

Arun Samanta Singhar, Pranshu Yadav, Ramesh Joshi, Srikant Ghosal, Jitendra Rajawat, Ankur Bindra and Debabrata Behera, who call themselves ‘On the Rocks’ after their cricket team, distributed 50 blankets to the poor, who were braving the cold night on footpaths. Arun, 26, from Odisha told TOI: “We have shelter to protect us from the elements. But there are many who do not even have proper blankets to beat the winter.”

The seven-member group began bonding in the software company, where they have been working for the past two years. On realising their shared interest went beyond cricket, they decided to come together and do their bit for common good. After working to spread awareness about breast cancer last year, the youngsters came up with the blanket idea this New Year. They raised Rs 15,000 through crowdfunding and purchased blankets from a private store. “Our friends helped us raise money, our colleagues too contributed,” added Arun.

The youngsters, all residents of Marathahalli, reached KR Market at 10:25pm. They connected with a local person there and began distributing blankets.

Last year, the group worked towards spreading awareness about breast cancer.

Representative image

BENGALURU: Consumers may see a hike in their monthly electric bills this year as Bescom has proposed a 9-12.8 % hike in retail supply tariff for low-tension, domestic consumers in areas falling under BBMP, other municipal corporations and urban local bodies.

The utility on Saturday submitted its proposal to the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission . Bescom plans to recover Rs 5,872-crore revenue deficit from the proposed tariff revision. KERC is expected to take a call after a public hearing.

While last year, KERC announced an average hike of 4.8% across four slabs for domestic consumers within Bescom limits, this year, the utility has sought for an increase in two slabs — 101 to 200 units and above 200. For both these consumption slabs, Bescom proposed a hike of Re 1 each — Rs 6.75 to Rs 7.75 and Rs 7.8 to Rs 8.8. The fixed charges payable per month have also been proposed to go up from Rs 60 to Rs 85 for 1KW and Rs 70 to Rs 95 for those using beyond that.

This would essentially mean that a consumer who uses 400 units of electricity in a month under the existing tariff and pays a bill of Rs 2,912, will have to cough up Rs 3,287 under the proposed rates. Similarly, a consumer who uses 300 units of electricity in a month under the existing tariff and pays Rs 2,132 will have to shell out Rs 2,407.

“The hike differs based on consumption patterns,” explained a Bescom official, adding, “Last year, six slabs were broken into four. This year, the hike has been proposed only for the last two slabs.”

As per the tariff order announced by KERC last year, the average increase, including a hike in fixed charges, was 33 paise per unit for domestic consumers in BBMP and other urban local body limits.

Lucknow University

LUCKNOW: To commemorate its centenary year, Lucknow University plans to launch a community radio to air anything and everything it wants — from public lectures and debates to interviews of visiting international faculty.

If all goes well, the LU radio will be up and running on its foundation day on November 25. “A detailed plan is being chalked out. Students and teachers will produce and broadcast the programmes that will include music, quiz, debate, storytelling and health talks, among others,” said LU spokesperson Sanjay Medhavi.

Medhavi said the radio was meant to boost student confidence and also prepare them for careers like production and jockeying. “At present, the university is making a list of logistics and equipment required, including a recording studio. Soon, a purchase committee meeting will be held. The responsibility of the community radio has been given to the varsity’s cultural board Sanskritiki,” he added.

It was way back in 2007 that LU had first decided to launch its own radio and had even procured a licence for the same from the Union ministry of information and broadcasting. The varsity had planned three-hour programmes thrice a week. However, the project didn’t begin on time and the delay cost LU its radio licence. Currently, City Montessori School and a private engineering varsity here boast community radios. If it does, LU will be the first government university to go on air.

On reaching the spot, Sachin handed over the pizzas to four persons sitting on the road. He gave them a bill of Rs 903 and asked for the money.

But the quartet refused to pay and assaulted him with an iron rod apart from breaking the head light and tail lamp of Sachin’s two-wheeler. The boy managed to escape and alerted his manager.

Police said Sachin attends MBA classes during the day and works as a pizza-delivery boy in the evening.

BENGALURU: With Sumanahalli flyover — where the carriageway developed a hole recently — declared distressed, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is set to conduct a safety audit of 25 flyovers and underpasses to find if they are fit for use. These include some of the oldest structures in places like Anand Rao Circle, Richmond Circle, Sirsi Circle, Central Silk Board and Lingarajpuram.

The civic body is the custodian of 59 flyovers, underpasses and pedestrian subways across the city and the 25 structures which have been shortlisted for the safety audit have been in use for more than seven years.

“We do not want to take any risk and it’s high time a safety audit of these flyovers and underpasses is done. Work is under way to restore Sumanahalli flyover. Similarly, all kind of safety measures will be adopted for the other structures. We have shortlisted an agency to check all aspects, including bearings, structural joints, RCC and other components. It will have to suggest remedies too,” said BBMP commissoner BH Anil Kumar.

Though the Palike had earmarked Rs 5 crore to conduct safety audit for these 25 flyovers/underpasses, the consultant — Infra Support Engineering Consultants — offered to do it for Rs 4.1 crore and landed the contract. The Bureau Veritas India Private Limited, which had declared Summanahalli flyover distressed, failed to qualify in the technical evaluations.

Under its 2019-20 budget, the civic agency had reserved Rs 50 crore towards maintenance of flyover and underpasses and deposited the same in an escrow account. On September 17 last year, the then major roads infrastructure standing committee gave its nod to use the funds, yet the engineers allegedly sat on the file and woke up only after the Sumanahalli flyover developed a hole on November 1.

“Things have been fast-tracked now. We invited tenders and finalised everything. The standing committee too has cleared it. Now we are waiting for a nod from the council. If all goes as per plan, safety audit will be initiated shortly,” explained an engineer.

“The consultant will also have to inspect and prepare the records of each flyover/underpasses separately, including photographs and videography from various angles, traffic surveys, load rating, mapping of any distress signs like cracks and spalling, core testing and crack monitoring. Further, crack patterns will also have to be studied,” the engineer added.

According to the proposal cleared by the standing committee, the Rs 50 crore budgetary allocation will be used for maintenance of these 25 underpasses/flyovers and some other pedestrian subways. The committee has recommended taking up all works through Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Limited to avoid tendering process, he added.

LUCKNOW: A 34-year-old mother of two fought off two snatchers despite sustaining head injuries in Jankipuram on Saturday evening, the incident a shining example of the degree of courage one must show when law and order in the state capital takes a back seat.

Police are scanning surveillance camera footage to identify the two men on a scooter who targeted Sandhya Singh, but failed to take her bag containing a wad of cash and two expensive mobile phones.

According to Sandhya’s complaint, the men attacked her not far from her Sector G residence around 7pm while she was on her way home from the market. They had been following her scooter for sometime and initially, Sandhya thought they were eve-teasers. “The men were constantly honking. So, I slowed down and allowed them to pass. But, the pillion-rider lunged at me and took my purse off my shoulder,” the woman said.

Despite falling off her scooter and bleeding from the head, Sandhya held on to her bag. She scraped her shoulders, arms and legs as the snatchers tried to flee with her belongings, but she didn’t let go. “I had my bank cards, Aadhaar card, two phones worth around Rs 80,000 and Rs 11,000 in cash in my bag. I couldn’t let them take all that away,” she said.

The snatchers hadn’t expected such grit and resistance. They were stumped. Besides, Sandhya’s screams had alerted a group of people huddled around a bonfire. The men had no choice, but to flee. A young man took Sandhya’s scooter and chased the snatchers, but they sped towards Tedhipulia and disappeared. Others took the injured woman home. She later received first aid at a nearby private hospital.

Sandhya claimed she was the third victim of snatch gangs in her area in the past four months. “Worse, I was unable to connect with police on Dial 112 despite four attempts between 8.17pm and 8.41pm. A case was lodged and police became active only after media got to know whathappened,” she said.

Gudamba SHO Ritendra Pratap Singh said they were investigating the case. “We are looking at CCTV camera footage in the area. Once the culprits are identified, they will be nabbed.”

Isro chairman K Sivan (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: The lift-off of geostationary communication satellite Gsat-30 on January 17 from European spaceport in French Guiana will be Indian Space Research Organisation 's ( Isro 's) first satellite launch this year, space agency chairman K Sivan told TOI. Gsat-30 weighing 3,450 kg will be a replacement for Insat-4A satellite .

The space agency is also scheduled to launch high-throughput communication satellite Gsat-20 this year. Three other high-throughput satellites of similar band Ku and Ka frequencies like Gsat-19 (June 5, 2017 launch), Gsat-29 (14 November 2018 launch) and Gsat-11 (Isro's heaviest satellite launched on December 5, 2018)) had already been launched.

The four together will boost internet revolution in India, especially in rural areas, as it will provide high bandwidth connectivity of over 100 Gbps, including in-flight and maritime connectivity. Together, all these satellites will help bridge the digital divide.

Gsat-11-like satellites are meant to provide multi-spot beam coverage over India's mainland and nearby islands. The satellites are special as they use multiple spot beams (a special kind of transponder that operates on a high frequency) that will increase internet speed and connectivity.

286,['6/01/2020'],Nagpur records highest ever sex ratio at birth in 2019,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: In a major achievement for Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), the city has registered highest-ever sex ratio at birth (SRB) of 951 girls for every 1000 boys in 2019. City is probably on top among all cities in the state and SRB of 2019 is better compared with overall SRB of state and as well as country.

NMC recorded 53,907 births in 2019 of which 27,630 were male children and 26,277 females, or 951 girls for every 1,000 boys. Figures show, previous best SRB of 944 was recorded in 2015. It saw a huge surge in 2019. In 2018, there were 30,106 male births to 28,297 female for a ratio of 939. City’s SRB was always below 940 except in 2015 and had even declined upto 900 in 2007.

President (elect) of Nagpur Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society Dr Vaidehi Marathe told TOI city’s SRB of 2019 is surely highest in the state and might be one of the top in the nation. As per data presented by Ministry of Women and Child Development in Parliament in June 2019, state’s overall SRB was 930 in 2018-19 and nation’s 931.

Though still a long way from the central government’s target of 994, city’s SRB of 2019 is considered healthy in government’s books. For the first time, it has matched with overall sex ratio of the district which was 951 as per population census of 2011.

The team of NMC including municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar, additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi, deputy municipal commissioner Ranjana Lade and deputy director of health Dr Bhavna Sonkusare have something to pat themselves.

Joshi attributed it to effective implementation of Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994, support from Indian Medical Association (IMA), NOGS, radiology centres and people. “NMC is taking the issue very seriously since 2013. Surprise visits and raids are conducted across the city. Monitoring of data is being done regularly at radiology centres and hospitals. People also became aware of ill-effects of sex discrimination. Various schemes launched by the Central, state governments and NMC related to women welfare and development are also proving beneficial,” he said.

Marathe and radiologist Raju Khandelwal said, “City’s SRB will go on increasing in coming years. Doctors, radiologists and all associations have played a very major role in this. Zero tolerance towards prenatal sex discrimination is being observed by doctors and radiologists. Government has implemented PCPDNT Act stringently and also launched various projects to educate people. Tremendous change can be seen in mentality of people,” they said.

Marathe added people had almost stopped requesting testing for discerning sex of fetus. “I have been practising for last 22 years in the city. I am blessed with two daughters and prenatal sex discrimination after first girl child never crossed my mind. In my initial practice days, some people used to request and I always used to give my own example. All doctors have started this practice but it was possible only due to mass awareness in public. Now trend is changing and educated families are happy to have only girl child,” she said.

Lucknow: A day after a 34-year-old man fell to his death from the sixth floor of a residential building in Gosainganj, his father lodged an FIR here on Sunday accusing a Pratapgarh resident of kidnap and murder over monetary dispute. After Allahabad native Ravindra Kumar was found dead on Saturday morning, police had spotted a noose made out of a drawstring in the balcony of an apartment that belonged to one Dinesh Yadav. However, father Rajendra Kumar’s FIR says one Om Prakash brought his son Ravindra to Yadav’s flat and killed him.

According to the complaint, Ravindra had called his wife on Thursday and asked her to arrange Rs 2 lakh and come to Pratapgarh, where he said he was being held hostage by STF personnel. However, the victim’s phone remained switched off since Friday.

“We came to know that my son had called a friend and told her that he had actually been kidnapped by Om Prakash and was being held in an apartment in Lucknow. He also said that Om Prakash would be responsible if something happened to him,” Rajendra said in the FIR.

Gosainganj station house officer D K Upadhyay said flat owner Yadav had stated that he had allowed Ravindra to hold a meeting with an unidentified man in his flat on the request of a common friend. “The meeting was over money matter. After dinner on Friday, the three slept in separate rooms. Yadav says he woke up in the morning and found Ravindra dead and the other man missing.”

Hardeep Singh Puri

NEW DELHI: The central government will provide flats even to the tenants in slum clusters under the Jahan Jhuggi Wahan Makaan (in-situ slum redevelopment ), Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Monday. This was perhaps the last announcement by the central government before the poll code of conduct kicked in.

Puri said New Delhi MP, Meenakshi Lekhi, had shared the concern of many who were staying on rent in slum clusters. “Let me make the announcement that not just shack owners, we will also give flats to those staying in these colonies on rent. (Kirayedaar ko bhi makan milega),” the minister said.

The Union housing ministry recently announced that the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) will soon float bids for in-situ slum redevelopment, which will benefit at least 10 lakh people. DDA has planned redevelopment of nearly two lakh slum dwelling unit to provide them pucca flats.

Puri also claimed that there has been huge response to the PM UDAY scheme, which aims at giving property ownership rights to people living in unauthorised colonies. He said till Monday nearly 80,000 people had registered themselves with DDA to get land titles. “Recently we handed over 20 conveyance deeds and ownership rights. Soon another 3,600 will get them. DDA has done all this in only three months which you could not do in 11 years,” the minister said.

Union home minister and BJP president Amit Shah also blamed the AAP government for delaying the entire process. “You have done maximum damage to the poor and people living in rural areas...our government has decided to implement the Jahan Jhuggi Wahan Makaan scheme to the poor,” Shah said.

Earlier, both Puri and Shah had slammed Kejriwal-led AAP government for not implementing the Ayushman Bharat scheme, which is aimed at providing free medical care to the poor. They said the scheme was incomparable with the mohalla clinics opened by the AAP government.

290,['6/01/2020'],"15 migratory species, over 900 birds spotted in bird counting","This story is from January 6, 2020

Kolhapur: Over 900 birds of around 15 different species were sighted during the bird counting event organised at the Rankala lake on Sunday.

The event organised by the ‘Birds of Kolhapur ’ group also saw the participation of photographers and bird lovers in the city. According to them, the city hosts three wetlands — Rankala, Kalamba, and the Rajaram lake — where a number of migratory bird species flock between October and March every year.

“On Sunday, we found migratory bird species of Northern shoveller, Marsh harrier, Marsh sandpiper, Green shank, Wood sandpiper, Common sandpiper, Little swift, Dusky crag martin, Barn swallow, Red-rumped swallow, Brown Shrike, Clamerous reed warbler, Yellow wagtail, and White wagtail,” said Pranav Desai, founder of Birds of Kolhapur.

Desai added that they spotted around 74 bird species, of which, 15 were migratory, four were local migratory and rest were local birds. The local migratory bird species included the Red munia and tricolored munia.

“The other migratory bird species which are regular visitors of the city’s wetlands are Ruddy Shellduck, Graganey, Lesser whistling duck, Brown headed gull, Common poachard, Common teal, Spot-billed Duck, Northern shoveler, Common stork, Common coot, Tern, Eurasian spoonbill, Heron and Woolly-necked Stork,” he said.

According to Desai, the species prefers shallow waters and picks up its food from sand or water. They often nest in small groups. The breeding habitat of these birds is marshes, shallow lakes and ponds. Birds from colder regions often migrate to lakes in the city every year during winters.

This was the group’s third outing this season, and, according to Desai, the migration period this year seems to have delayed by at least a month due to delayed monsoon and unseasonal rain.

“This is the impact of climate change. There are many bird species which are yet to arrive in the city,” he said.

Swapnil Pawar, a member of environmental organization Green Force and part of the Sunday’s activity, said, “These kinds of activities are the need of the hour. Being part of bird-watching trip helps amateurs know the bird, its name, colour, habitat and unique characters. Many citizens and students are expressing interest in the initiative via social media, which is heartening to see.”

292,['6/01/2020'],KMC to start another dog sterilisation centre,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is going to start a second centre for sterilisation of stray dogs.

Currently, sterilisation of stray dogs is being carried out at the centre in Shendapark. However, the facility is inadequate to keep the dogs there for a long time.

According to a civic official, 15 dogs are sterilised every day, but around 30 to 35 dogs are being caught on a daily basis. “The site for setting up of another centre is not fixed yet, however officials claim that the centre may come up in the E ward from where the large number of stray dogs are caught every day,” he said.

A senior health official of KMC said, “We are unable to keep the dogs in large number at the facility in Shendapark. We have to empty the area every week and many dogs are let go without sterilisation. Now, we have decided to start another facility somewhere in the E ward. We are looking for abandoned buildings where the facility can be started. Adequate staff will be assigned and an additional dog van will be procured.”

Last year, dog bite cases had gone above 300 as recorded with Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Civil Hospital. As per Animal Birth Control Regulation of 2001, only sterilisation is prescribed to bring the population of stray dogs under control.

“Since the start of the facility at Shendapark, we have sterilised over 700 dogs. On the other hand the actual number of stray dogs is more than 4,000 in the city and the number has been increasing. We are going to assign the task of sterilisation to an NGO,” said the official.

Officials claim that waste dumped on the road side and in open spaces are reason behind growth of stray dogs and their menace. Also, many people abandon their pets due to some disease or age-related issues.

“In such cases we are going to act against the owners for abandoning their dogs. In some areas the dog menace has come down owing to improved collection of the waste. Localities near slum areas where sanitation issues are not addressed regularly have large number of stray dogs,” a civic official said.

The KMC, last year, had asked citizens not to poison the dogs as it is against the law. Instead, citizens can report to the local sanitation official about the presence of the stray dogs in their localities.

LUCKNOW: A hi-tech control room will be set up in state capital this year to put a check on copying in UP Board class X and XII exams scheduled from February 9. The modern control room is being set up at Jubilee Inter College and will be completed by January 10.

The control room will get live feeds from CCTV cameras installed in examination centres. Officials will randomly check the feed to ensure no unfair means are used during exams.

There are total 112 examination centres including one in Lucknow district jail. CCTVs have been installed in examination halls of all centres. The facility will help officials to check each examination centre. Action will be taken against the centre incharge if CCTV cameras are found to be dysfunctional.The live feed will have both video and audio as microphones have been attached with CCTV cameras.

“The user ID and password of the digital video recorders of CCTVs installed examination centre will be made available to UP Board officials in the city so that they can monitor examinations from the control room,” said district inspectors of all schools Mukesh Kumar Singh.

Earlier, several anti-copying flying squads were formed to visit examination centres to check use of unfair means. Manual inspection not only used to take time, but many centres were not covered because of limited hands, said officials. Often, they added, examination centre incharge used to take excuse that their CCTVs cameras and recording systems are dysfunctional when asked by flying squad to scan the proceedings. However, now, they said, online monitoring will make anti-copying measures more effective and less time consuming.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP ’s mass contact programme to create awareness on Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) began on a sour note in the state. Writer George Onakkoor flayed the decision to avoid Muslims from the list for citizenship when he was called on by Union sports minister Kiren Rijiju .

Rijiju had reached the house of the writer at Nalanchira in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday morning as part of the party’s door-to-door campaign in support of CAA.

The writer said it was most unfortunate that only six religions have been included in the list for providing citizenships and India being a secular country it raises concern that Muslims have been avoided from the list. “We have so many castes and religions. We also have several ideologies. But, we respect each other. We are secular. Hence, this list has created concern among the people,” Onakkoor told Rijiju.

However, the Union minister said the government has not avoided any particular religion from providing citizenship. “We have given citizenship to several good Muslims like singer Adnan Sami in the past. We have only said that illegal immigrants will not be given citizenship. It is not against Muslims,’’ he said.

Onakkoor made it clear to the minister that he does not believe in any particular religion and for him “India is the religion”.

When asked about the criticism made by the writer against CAA, Rijiju said: “It is the beauty of the democracy that everyone has the freedom to criticise.”

On the comment that the Centre has given citizenship to good Muslims, he clarified: “What I meant was Muslims with no criminal backgrounds. There are no good or bad Muslims. What I wanted to say was Muslims with no criminal track record.’’

The Union minister flayed the resolution passed by the state assembly against the CAA. “It was just a political gimmick. Citizenship is not a state subject. Hence, the state assembly has no role in it. The resolution will not have any impact,” he said.

Rijiju, as part of the mass contact campaign, also met several personalities, including Latin Archbishop Soosa Pakiam, in the state capital. The bishop also raised concern over the amendment brought in the Act.

In Gujarat around 43.1% children born in 2017 died before their first birthday

AHMEDABAD: The state government on Sunday relied on the Sample Registration System (SRS) 2017 report and claimed that Gujarat ’s Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) was below the national average. But the same report also claims that among the total deaths in the state, nearly 10.4% of the deaths are of children belonging to the age of 0-4 years. This was the third highest among all age groups in the state. While death rate is 10. 9 % for the age group of 70-74 years and 10.8 % in age group of 65-69.

The SRS figures show that in 2014, the death rates in the 0-4 years group was 14.1% of all age groups, while in 2015 the death rate was 13.4% and in 2016 it was 12.4%.

Moreover, the SRS-2017 data revealed that in 100 deaths across all ages an average of 21.2% children were there who died before their tenth birthday. The data reveals that the death of children in the age group of 0-9 years was high in rural areas where every fourth death reported in the state was that of the children in the 0-9 age group. However, in urban areas the death rate was 14.8% for the same age group.

The male-female death ratio was also on the higher side in the age group of 0-9 years. Around 23.5% deaths among females was in this age group in the state. This was 3.8% more than the death rate of male children (19.6%) However, the same when it comes to rural areas was 28.5% which was 5.2% more as compared to the death rate of male children.

Also in the state, around 43.1% children born in 2017 died before their first birthday. The death percentage of 43.1% was the highest in the past four years. In 2014 around 41.7% children died before they turned one year old, while the same were 40.8% in 2015 and 38.1% in 2016.

According to the data the death rate in the age group of 0-1 year was 5% higher than in 2016. The death rate in the 0-1 year age group was high because of lack of medical facilities. A senior officer said that it was evident from the SRS report which stated that around 6.1% of the live births involved mothers who had not received any medical attention at time of delivery at hospitals. However this was nearly 10% (9.5%) in rural areas and only 0.5% in urban areas. The officer said that this gap of 9% was an indication that still many areas in Gujarat do not have medical facilities. Experts also feel that when it comes to giving medical attention to girls it was not a priority in rural areas. The gap of 5% in the deaths of female and male children was an indication that not much attention was given to girls once they fall sick.

300,['6/01/2020'],"MIM to dissolve all bodies across Maharashtra, except Mumbai","This story is from January 6, 2020

AURANGABAD: The Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (MIM) has decided to dissolve all its district-level, taluka-level and city-level bodies along with its student and women wings in the state, except Mumbai , in order to give opportunity to new faces.

Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, MIM’s newly-appointed state working president Gaffar Quadri said in the backdrop of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) general elections likely to be held in March or April, new life will be injected into the party.

“The party will field candidates on around 75 seats in the 115-member civic body,” he said.

Quadri, who finished second in the state assembly elections for the second consecutive time from Aurangabad East constituency in October 2019, said there were mistakes made by the party in the past but they will work on them and start afresh.

“As the party is expanding, the qualities and capability of party workers is emerging more clearly. We are aiming to work towards party organisation by giving chance to new faces as well as retaining some old faces to achieve maximum reach,” Quadri said.

“MIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, MIM MP in Aurangabad Imtiyaz Jaleel and party’s senior member and Telangana MLA Syed Ahmed Pasha Quadri have decided that apart from Muslims party would focus on SC, ST, VJNT and the OBC communities,” he added.

Being asked about suspension of party corporators in AMC, Quadri said corporators are not the party. “Irrespective of whether their vote would make a difference or not, the corporators should have followed party’s directive of participating in the deputy mayor elections and voting for party candidate. It is a matter of discipline. If suspended corporators offer an apology letter, a meeting may be held to reconsider them,” Quadri said.

Responding to a question on what went wrong in the alliance with Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) in 2019 assembly elections, Quadri said the MIM’s doors are still open for VBA.

“We are still unable to understand what led to the end of alliance,” he added.

The task force on national infrastructure pipeline (FY 2019-20 to FY 2024-25 ) report, which was declared by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently, listed infrastructure projects worth around $1.4 trillion (Rs 102 lakh crore). However, this projected investment did not have any inputs from Gujarat as the state government had failed to submit its list of projects to the task force in time.According to the new infrastructure investment estimates prepared by the state government, the urban development department has the highest share of Rs 50,465 crore proposed investments.The energy and petrochemicals department has the second largest proposed investment share of Rs 40,269 crore.

Aurangabad: The Left and democratic party activists on Sunday said that the Citizens Amendment Act ( CAA ) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) were meant to divert the attention of the people from the central government’s failure on all fronts.

Led by the CPI, different outfits on Sunday organised a token hunger strike in front of the statue of Dr B R Ambedkar near Bhadkal Gate here.

Abhay Taksal, the CPI secretary, said that the party has launched a drive across the country since January 1 to draw the attention of the people toward the real motive behind the CAA and NRC. The government has failed on the economic front, there is a decline in GDP.

The CPI and other parties cannot allow the government to divert the attention from issues like worsening of the economy, increasing unemployment, rising prices of essential commodities, and others.

Senior CPI leaders including Majohar Taksal, Ram Baheti, Ashfaq Salami and social activists including S G Shuttari were among those who addressed the gathering at the token hunger strike, said Taksal. “We will not allow the government to divide the nation”, he added.

303,['6/01/2020'],Parking spots for transport vehicles identified: KMC,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) and traffic police department have finished their joint survey to identify spots for parking transport vehicles.

Officials from both the departments have fixed separate locations for passenger and goods transport vehicles. The spots have been identified considering the access to the transporters and on open spaces owned by the KMC.

The survey was started in December after directions from mayor Surmanjiri Latkar. The work to draft the comprehensive mobility plan (CMP) is underway and fixing the spots for private transport vehicles is one of the several components of the task.

Netradip Sarnobat, chief city engineer of KMC, said, “Private transport vehicles are parked haphazardly and cause severe traffic congestion in most parts of the city. There was a demand from private transporters to fix spots which we took into consideration. For instance, we have fixed parking spots at Kawala Naka, near Tararani Market and Venus Corner — located near transit places such as Central Bus Stand (CBS) and railway station.”

He added, “These spots are also located along the route towards Mahalaxmi temple and other tourist places. We have fixed another spot at Sasane Ground which was nearest to the CBS. However, the locals opposed it stating that the ground should be used only by the locals and not for parking. We have also identified spots near Shiroli Jakat Naka and Tawade Hotel for goods transport.”

After several restrictions by the police administration, transporters have started parking their vehicles outside of the city. “But at night they park their vehicles near to the CBS and the railway station. Other sites for private passenger vehicles have been fixed at Venus Corner and KMT’s reserved land plot near Mauli Putala in Rajarampuri,” Sarnobat said

“We are going to develop these parking sites and its implementation will begin soon. Inputs from estate and town planning departments were used to fix these spots,” he added.

Aurangabad: Concluding that the civic body failed to follow the procedure while demolishing a tarpaulin shade at a prime plot, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has disposed a petition filed against the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC).

Tenant of a plot situated in Delhi Gate area with CTS number 11583 had moved HC stating that he received a notice from the civic body on July 11, 2019, asking to produce all the documents pertaining to the plot.

The notice, while asking him to remain present on July 12, cited about the Salim Ali Lake related suo motu PIL pending before the HC. The tenant moved the HC stating that the notice was received on July 15, but the civic body demolished the tarpaulin shade a day later i.e. on July 16.

Citing documents placed on record, the HC observed that the tenant had filed a civil suit against the civic body as well as another person in the year 2010. On July 7, 2013 while delivering the judgment, the civil court restrained the civic body from perpetually causing obstruction or evacuating him from the said property without following due course of law.

The division bench of the HC, comprising justices SV Gangapurwala and Mangesh Patil, observed that: “Corporation is the instrumentality of the state. It has to act as a model litigant. It was expected of the corporation to follow the procedure before resorting to demolition of the construction.”

Citing that the civic body failed to follow the due process while removing the shade, lawyers Ashutosh S Kulkarni and Khan Aamer Anwar pointed out the written intimations they had sent to the authorities concerned.

Taking cognizance of the same, the HC observed: “The municipal corporation has the authority to demolish illegal construction and evacuate the person, but only by following the due procedure of law.”

The HC even reiterated the laid down the principles in a reported judgement, describing the procedure for removing an illegal structure.

“If the respondent (civic body) has come to the conclusion that the construction of the petition is unauthorised, then certainly the corporation was required to give a notice to the petitioner. In the present case, the same is not given,” the bench said.

The HC even asked the petitioner to not to carry out further construction without permission of the corporation and or the civil court where the suit will be filed.

“We observe that the corporation failed to follow the procedure while demolishing the construction of the petitioner over the writ land. As the writ land is an open piece of land, the petitioner shall be deemed to be in possession,” the court said.

AHMEDABAD: Even as Congress-ruled Rajasthan is under fire following the deaths of 107 infants in December at Kota’s state government-run J K Lon Hospital, Congress’s Gujarat unit trained its guns on the state government here on Sunday. Congress’s criticism followed the state government’s admission that in December alone, 111 infants in Rajkot and 88 in Ahmedabad had died in civil hospitals.State Congress president Amit Chavda said, “The infant deaths may not be just restricted to Ahmedabad or Rajkot alone. The number may be in thousands if hospitals across the state are taken into account,” said Chavda.The figures released by the state health department on Sunday claimed that over past three months — from October to December 2019 — the two civil hospitals in Rajkot and Ahmedabad had recorded deaths of 269 and 253 infants respectively.Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, who is also the health minister, said on Sunday said that the infant deaths were unfortunate “but within limit.” He claimed that patients from outside the state are being treated at state-run hospitals and are partially responsible for the spike in the infant death numbers.Patel said that Congress is attempting to divert attention from Rajasthan. “I would like to ask the Congress governments in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh why patients from these neighbouring states come to Gujarat hospitals for treatment, if they have good healthcare systems in place?” he asked.At Rajkot civil hospital which registered 111 infant deaths in December, there were 388 admissions in the NICU. Of these, 160 admissions were of cases referred from other health facilities. In Ahmedabad, which registered 88 deaths in December, of the total 415 children admitted to NICU, 243 were referred from other health facilities.While clearly drawing the line between cases from within the hospital and those referred from other health facilities within or outside the state, Patel said that from October to December 1,296 cases were treated in Rajkot hospital of which 499 cases were referred from outside. Similarly, in Ahmedabad for the same months 1,357 infants were treated at the NICU of Civil Hospital, Asarwa, of which 802 cases were referred from other facilities.Patel said that an underweight child, unhealthy mother, improper pregnancy practices and lack of awareness about mother and child health are some of the reasons that contributed to infant deaths. “We are already creating awareness and are also setting up more SNCU and Bal Sakha units across the state. The health of pregnant women is also checked through online tracking system,” said Patel.Gujarat Congress’s senior leader and current Bihar in-charge, Shaktisinh Gohil, said that two ministers of Congress government in Rajasthan are camping in Kota (after the deaths). “But in the CM’s Rajkot constituency, 143 children have already died and he did not care to answer the questions raised by media,” he said. “Those who are doing politics over children’s deaths in Rajasthan, why are they silent here?”The data shared by the health department shows that the government hospital in Rajkot had 87 deaths in October, 71 deaths in November and 111 deaths in December last year. The figures were 19.3%, 15.5% and 28% of the total patients admitted in the Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) at the hospital. The authorities claimed that 35-40% of the children were referred from other hospitals and were already critical when they arrived.At Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad – considered to be the biggest civil hospital in Asia – 91 infants died in October, 74 in November and 88 in December last year, where the death rate was 18.4%, 16.4% and 21.2% respectively.

AHMEDABAD: With the clamour on child deaths across the state in tertiary healthcare facilities in December, the experts have pointed at malnutrition as a major cause for the phenomenon.The Food and Nutrition Security Analysis for 2019 had put Gujarat along with Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh for the highest stunting and underweight categories. The state government had also mentioned in the assembly in June 2019 that 1.42 lakh children in Gujarat were underweight and out of the total, 24,101 were severely underweight.On Sunday, the state deputy chief minister and health minister Nitin Patel listed lack of awareness about issues related to pregnancy health and nutrition as one of the reasons for the deaths of infants in Ahmedabad and Rajkot hospitals.The Lancet report titled ‘The burden of child and maternal malnutrition and trends in its indicators in the states of India: the Global Burden of Disease Study 1990–2017’ published in December 2019 put Gujarat at the top in child wasting (low height to weight ratio) with 19.3% of total children and sixth in child stunting with prevalence of 39.6%. The report mentioned that 20.7% of the total children had reported low birth weight.A senior health department official on condition of anonymity told TOI that a significant number of children born in the state have 2.5kg or less birth weight. “The premature babies and those having mothers struggling with anaemia are obviously more prone to after-birth complications. More often than not, the tertiary care centres receive children having multiple complications and thus death rate is high,” said the official.Dr Kranti Vora, additional professor, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar (IIPH-G), said that need of the hour is to strengthen community-level and facility-level care for reduction in infant mortality.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73114654,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-611964,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/malnutrition-contributing-to-child-deaths-in-state/articleshow/73113834.cms

Aurangabad: Five people have been booked by Cidco police for stealing electricity after a complaint was filed against them by a state power utility official on Saturday.

During a recent drive against power theft, carried out by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), the officials found a total of three establishments and households stealing electricity for the past two years.

“A team led by MSEDCL deputy executive engineer Pravin Patil detected power thefts at three places under our jurisdiction. Patil, in one of his complaints, alleged that a father-son duo in Jaibhavaninagar Mukundwadi was stealing electricity for the past 24 months — a total of 4,862 units worth Rs 30,023,” an officer from Cidco police station said.

In the second case, a man and his relative in Jaibhavaninagar were caught stealing electricity since November 27, 2019. The MSEDCL team unearthed the theft and subsequently lodged a complaint against the duo for causing loss to the company to the tune of Rs 54,332 by stealing 6,380 units of electricity.

In the last case, the team found one person to have stolen 3,604 units of electricity in Laxmi Colony area. The man is accused of causing losses to the tune of Rs 27,080.

Aurangabad: Around 10 months after an official announcement, the new South Coast Railway Zone is yet to be carved out of the South Central Railway (SCR).

The ministry of railways, during March last year, had announced formation of new South Coast Railway Zone by clubbing Guntakal, Guntur and Vijaywada divisions — currently part of the SCR.

The new zone would have limited the jurisdiction of SCR to Nanded, Hyderabad and Secundarabad divisions only. Railway activist Omprakash Varma said stakeholders were expecting more attention to Marathwada if the size of SCR would have shrunk.

“Every time we observe that Nanded division often gets step-motherly treatment when it comes to improving train connectivity, infrastructure or facilities. Nanded division could have witnessed more attention with the SCR having only three zones,” he said.

Another railway activist Raj Somani said the railway ministry must either create new zone without wasting time or attach Nanded division to the Central Railway.

“We strongly believe that the SCR pays more attention to Andhra Pradesh and other southern regions. The reasons are best known to the authorities concerned, but Marathwada having a strong tourism potential is badly ignored,” he said.

When contacted, a senior SCR official from Nanded division said no fresh communication was received regarding creation of the new zone.

“The new zone was proposed to ensure administrative convenience. In the existing structuring, the proposed restructuring aims at welfare of all zones, including Nanded,” a senior SCR official said.

The new South Coast Railway Zone, which will take the total number of railway divisions in the country to 17, will have headquarters at Visakhapatnam.

Special trains to Panvel

Aurangabad: In order to clear extra rush of passengers, South Central Railway (SCR) has announced weekly special trains between Nanded and Panvel.

Nanded-Panvel weekly special train (No. 07617), will depart from Nanded at 5.30pm on all Saturdays of January and is expected to reach Panvel at 9am on the next day.

In the return direction, Panvel-Nanded weekly special train (No. 07618) will depart from Panvel at 10am on all Sundays of January and is scheduled to arrive at Nanded by 5am on the next day.

Panchal was caught with 53 bottles of liquor worth Rs 1 lakh

AHMEDABAD: After obtaining a health permit to buy liquor for himself, a man from Satellite area, D K Panchal, 67, allegedly entered the world of bootlegging , police said. Besides buying premium brands of liquor from local permit shops, he also used to bring liquor from foreign trips and store the liquor for illegal sale. He allegedly supplied the liquor to residents of posh neighbourhoods like Satellite, Anandnagar and Vastrapur .

Panchal, a resident of B-501 in Panchdhara Plaza on Satellite Road near Nehrunagar Circle, was caught with 53 bottles of premium brand liquor worth Rs 1 lakh in his possession. Following up on a tip-off, Satellite police raided his flat on Saturday night, seized the bottles and booked him for possessing liquor exceeding his permit limit. Panchal faces a jail term which may extend to three years.

According to the FIR registered with Satellite police, the cops had received a tip-off from a citizen that someone has stored liquor bottles at Panchdhara Plaza near Venus Ground. When police reached there, Panchal was walking around a damaged car, which did not have wheels and was supported on bricks. The police team found a liquor bottle in the car. On being questioned, Panchal told police that he keeps a liquor bottle in the car, when some potential customer for the car comes to see it. Unconvinced by Panchal’s story, cops went into his flat and conducted a search. They found 52 more liquor bottles in a cupboard. While the police officials were in the act of seizing the bottles, Panchal produced his liquor permit, but the cops ignored it as he had far exceeded his health permit quota of five units a month. “Panchal, who worked in the business of door and window fabrication in UAE, had settled in the Satellite area 11 years ago. Apart from his own consumption, he began selling premium brand liquor bottles ,” said a police official.

314,['6/01/2020'],German scholar offers a different perspective on PFI,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Kozhikode: At a time when the Union government is mulling a ban on Popular Front of India ( PFI ) citing the violence during anti-CAA protests, a study by a research scholar with Oxford Department of International Development offers a different perspective that contradicts the version of the security agencies.

While the government and intelligence agencies brand PFI as an ‘extremist organization’ and a threat to internal security, German scholar Arndt Emmerich finds the organization as the agency that empowers Muslims through legal education and by making them aware of their constitutional rights.

In his paper ‘Political education and legal pragmatism of Muslim organizations in India: A study of the changing nature of Muslim minority politics’, Emmerich says the emergence of PFI signals ‘a fundamental shift’ in Muslim politics in India.

The researcher says the shift is from an identity-based and inward-looking politics to an “inclusive and confident debate centred on minority empowerment through political education and legal activism”.

Many PFI cadres told the researcher that the political and legal education imparted by the organization reduced their insecurity and “raised their confidence in a context of regular intimidation by Hindu-nationalist groups, police harassment, and racial profiling of the Muslim community”.

Emmerich did three rounds of field work in India for the study and had visited cities such Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and New Delhi to interact with many PFI leaders and cadres.

He notes that “since the emergence of al-Qaida and the September 11, 2001 attacks, Islamic movements and Muslim organizations around the world have been disparaged as unwilling to integrate into democratic regimes and reluctant to accept the separation of religion and politics”.

Emmerich believes that unlike the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), which sometimes took “unconstitutional and exclusive approach to social change by promoting an Islamic state in India”, PFI has “included specifically non-Islamic signifiers in its programmes, such as yoga exercise, ayurveda, Hindi and Sanskrit slogans, (and) the national flag”.

Citing the example of PFI’s exploration of legal avenues to fight the ‘police discrimination’ during the violence in Mysore in 2009, Emmerich says the PFI has succeeded in convincing the community that “spreading constitution-related education fosters confidence among Muslims”.

The researcher believes that “PFI’s activists try to provide political education to its support base to enhance their constitutional awareness and nurture a positive attitude to India’s political and legal institutions”. He believes that this position is important in a society, “which is loaded against the marginalized”.

Meerut: A video of men in plain clothes wielding baton and getting down from private vehicles at a protest spot in Meerut on December 20 is doing rounds on the social media. This comes amid mounting criticism of ""excesses"" by the state police in handling violent clashes on December 20.

Reacting to the viral video, additional director general (Meerut) Prashant Kumar said, “Prima facie, it does not appear the outsiders were with the police team. It could be an act of self-defence in those circumstances. The matter is being probed.”

One of the videos was tweeted by Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) vice-president Jayant Chaudhary where a local BJP functionary and his supporters can be seen getting out of a car that was parked close to a police team trying to control a huge gathering of protesters.

One of the men in the video was identified as Maninder Vihan, a local BJP functionary.

“Is this Meerut BJP office-bearer a police aide? Does the vehicle parked behind police formation belong to the department? Do these batons control crowd or instigate it? Is any organisation left which is not sympathising with the ruling party and embroiled in politics?” Chaudhary said in a tweet that was shared over 3,000 times.

According to sources, the video made at a protest site shows several men getting down from private vehicles wielding batons normally available only with the police and law-enforcing agencies.

Local BJP unit admitted that Vihan is an active party worker but distanced itself from his presence at the protest site.

“I have seen the video. Vihan is present at the spot but it has nothing to do with the party. He is supervisor of security at Siwaya toll plaza in Daurala area. He is a party worker but has no responsibility,” Mukesh Singhal, BJP’s Meerut Mahanagar president, said.

316,['6/01/2020'],2nd marathon on Mukundra tiger turf in two months,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Jaipur: The forest department has allowed another commercial marathon in the core area of the Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR) in alleged violation of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

While green crusaders slammed the department for setting a wrong precedent, officials justified the marathon saying it was being done for the promotion of eco-tourism and conservation of forest and wildlife. In all, 332 runners took part in the marathon which passed through the core area including Garadia Mahadev, Jawahar Sagar Dam and Borwas with portion of Rawatbhata on Sunday. The participants — 160 adults and the rest children — kicked off the marathon from Kota which ended at the reserve after covering a distance of over 80 km.

After the first marathon on November 3, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had asked the state to submit a factual report on a complaint alleging violation of wildlife rules by the organisers.

Chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Kota, Anand Mohan said, “We sent a reply to the NTCA in December. In 2015, the state government had issued an order quoting Section 64 (The state government may, by notification, make rules for carrying out the provisions of this Act) of WPA, 1972 that allowed tourism in the tiger core area. Marathon comes under promotion of tourism and approvals for both the events were given at the same time last year.” Wildlife activists, however, alleged that the forest department had misinterpreted the order.

MHTR’s local advisory committee member Tapeshwar Singh Bhati said, “Allowing residents to run inside the reserve is blatant violation of the wildlife Act. Moreover, Section 64 of WPA 1972 , which the government has mentioned, only grants powers to decide fees for tourists going inside the park in vehicles. Organising a commercial event, even in association with the forest department inside the reserve, is nowhere mentioned in the Act.”

Experts claimed that under Section 38-O of WPA 1972, only NTCA can lay down rules for tourism activities and guidelines for project tiger from time to time in the buffer as well as core areas of reserves along with ensuring their due compliance.

A notification dated October 15, 2012 issued by NTCA stated that no such commercial activities should be allowed in the tiger reserve in the name of promoting tourism.

Also, the state government does not have any powers to allow such activities. Bhopal-based green activist Ajay Dubey, who had complained about the previous marathon following which NTCA issued the notice told TOI, “The Rajasthan government has set a shameful trend in the country as tiger reserves are mainly set up for conservation and not for tourism. It a sheer violation of the Act as any tourism activities should also be approved by the NTCA under tiger conservation plan of the reserve.”

317,['6/01/2020'],Widening of Harsul road also pending,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Aurangabad: The proposed widening of Harsul Road heading towards Ajanta caves, which has been lingering since 2013, is pending despite assurances from the local political leaders.

The narrow stretch of the road causes vehicular traffic at Harsul, especially on holidays when there are more tourists.

In a letter addressed to the former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, during May last year, then Aurangabad deputy mayor Vijay Autade had sought financial assistance from the government for the compensation to affected property owners from Harsul.

While Autade was following up on the issue with the state authorities, his recent resignation has faded the remaining hopes of quick steps for the road-widening.

Long queues of vehicles on either side of Harsul have become a common sight with tourists visiting the World Heritage Site of Ajanta caves.

Local Shiv Sena corporator Raju Vaidya said the new government in Maharashtra will take steps to resolve the issue of vehicular traffic at Harsul. “The issue will be taken up with the respective ministers shortly,” he said.

The stretch of the road is around one and a half km. Around 123 residential properties will be affected due to the proposed widening.

The local civic body was considering to give an alternative piece of land to the displaced property owners at Harsul instead of compensation.

While it was proposed that nearly 3.5 acre land of the Frozen Semen Laboratory in Harsul could be utilised for rehabilitating the property owners, it did not work out due to lack of funds.

Though ,the initially proposed width of the road was 100m, it may come down to around 80 feet to 90 feet after opposition from the locals.

Situated at a distance of nearly 100 km from Aurangabad, Ajanta caves are visited by a large number of tourists from across the world every year.

AHMEDABAD: For those who are tired of the frequent traffic snarls around Vastrapur lake , here is some good news. In the next fortnight the civic body will have completed the widening of the 18 metre wide road which opens just at the landing of the IIM-A bridge towards Vastrapur lake.

The road is 960 metre long and will run behind Alpha-One mall will go past the Karnavati hostel access road joining the ‘Sarkari Vasahat’ road and towards another lane running behind GMDC ground to join Drive-In road. “This will ease the frequent traffic jams at Manav Mandir junction,” said a senior AMC official.

Over the past four years the civic body learned that during VIP visits, like that of Chinese president Xi Jinping and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, another access route was required for smooth traffic flow. “Since most VIP stays are arranged in a hotel near Vastrapur lake, traffic movement is badly hit. This could be an alternative access route during security drills,” added the AMC official.

320,['6/01/2020'],Govt set to cap trade margins on drug sale to check profiteering,"This story is from January 6, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Centre is set to cap trade margins on medicines , allowing retailers to earn 20% on the MRP and wholesalers a 10% margin at which they supply. It is proposed that the total margin from the first point of sale should not exceed 42.8%, sources said.

In case of medicines, the first point of sale is usually at the level of wholesalers. While the government has already applied the same formula on cancer medicines, it is likely to take up in the first phase cardiac, diabetes and other medicines where the unit price is more than Rs 10, sources said.

Drugs priced at less than Rs 5 a unit may be exempted from the trade margin cap. Drug price regulator- National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA)- has asked the industry to give its final inputs by January 10, after which the government is expected to take a final call.

As of now, in case of essential medicines that are under government price cap, trade margins are capped at 16% and 8% for retailers and wholesalers, respectively. Rationalisation of margins will be implemented in phases on medicines which are presently outside the government's price control mechanism. Though the proposal has been opposed by chemists and retailers who feel their margins will be squeezed, the industry has largely agreed on the proposed cap. At present, companies are free to price such drugs and increase it by up to 10% annually. Sources suggested if the formula proves to be success, the government might even consider applying the same to all drugs.

Ashok Bhagat, senior inspector of Panchavati police station , said the vehicles have piled up over the years with some being on the premises since the year 2003.

“Some vehicles were abandoned on the city streets most probably by thieves, while in some cases accident victims left their damaged vehicles on the road and never bothered to take them back,” he said.

Bhagat said it was an uphill task the trace owners of the vehicles. In many cases, wrong registration number plates were put on the vehicle. Thus, after coordinating with the Regional Transport Office (RTO) for over two weeks, police managed to identify the owners of 111 vehicles.

“Some of the vehicle owners were not residing on the address registered with the RTO. The list of the vehicle owners has been put up at the police station. People should visit the police station to check if their name is on the list,” he said.

“If the vehicle is not taken back within the next week, we would be free to auction them. The impounded vehicles include bikes, scooters, auto-rickshaws and cars,” he added.

City police and Pune-based Gangamata organisation, which is into finding owners of abandoned vehicles, have taken up the activity of tracing the owners of the vehicles. Eventually, all police stations across the city will be cleared of unwanted vehicles on their premises.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Union minister Kiren Rijiju called the resolution passed by the state assembly against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) “a political gimmick”. He was attending a talk ‘India Supports CAA ’ organized at Press Club on Sunday.

Rijiju said that both Congress and Left parties are two sides of the same coin.

“They started making false claims not pertaining to the Act. They passed some kind of resolution in the assembly against CAA, which is not under their purview. Only Parliament can make any amendment in the Act. The political gimmick will have a deep adverse effect on the growth of Kerala ,” said Rijiju.

Speaking about his visit to religious leaders in the city, he said that they have communicated their apprehensions regarding the Act. “We will convince them. As a government in a democracy, we will ensure that we take along every section of the society,” he said.

Speaking about the violent protest against CAA, he alleged that there were no protests when the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was being discussed and the violent protests started only after it became an Act.

He reiterated that former finance minister Chidambaram, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and even Jawaharlal Nehru had started the initial steps, which was improvised by the BJP government.

He also hoped that BJP will form a government in Kerala soon.

Kolhapur: Cabinet minister Hasan Mushriff and minister of state Satej Patil assured the delegation of lawyers that they will discuss the issue of setting up of circuit bench of Bombay High Court at Kolhapur with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.

Under the leadership of president of Kolhapur District Bar Association (KDBA), the delegation of lawyers met the ministers at their residences on Sunday.

“We met Mushriff at his residence in Kagal and Patil at his residence in the city on Sunday. We have put forth all the details regarding our agitation since last 34 years and the developments in last few years. Both the ministers are well aware of the issue. They have assured us that they will take up the issue with the chief minister and do their best to get a circuit bench in Kolhapur ,” KDBA president Ranjit Gawade said.

“We are fighting for the circuit bench from the last 34 years. Lawyers have launched several agitations in the past and had also boycotted the court proceedings for quite some time. The issue of circuit bench comes in the jurisdiction of the high court. However, it needs assurance from state government for providing infrastructural set up for the same. We have always felt that the state government has not shown any interest in the matter and have not taken any steps that will help in setting up the circuit bench in Kolhapur,” said a senior member of the KDBA on the condition of anonymity.

327,['6/01/2020'],He likened surfing to meditation,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Jack Hebner aka Surfing Swami

As Hebner, Swami was one of the early members of North Florida’s first surf club, Oceanside, in 1963 and was among the pioneers of surfing on the East Coast. He established Sri Narasingha Chaitanya Ashram in Govindaji Gardens in Srirangapatna in 1994.

Kishore Kumar, who is president of the Surfing Federation of India, met Swami in 1999.

“I was at the ashram in Mysuru along with my younger brother, Kiran. We were drawn to his lessons on yoga and spirituality. I was 12 and decided to quit schooling to be with Swami. The next year, he started taking us on road trips. We visited South Indian temples and beaches. Swami introduced us to surfing,” he said.

“We had been to Mahabalipuram in 2002 and explored the Kerala coast in 2004. Since we had set up a spiritual base in Karnataka, Surfing Swami was keen on developing a surfing destination for the state. We visited several beaches, but Swami was not happy. When we reached Mulki, he loved the place and decided to buy land and build an ashram that gradually became Mantra Surf Club. Initially, only his disciples would come to the ashram and surf but soon we started teaching surfing to children of the local fisherfolk,” said Kishore.

Swami likened surfing to a form of meditation, and a way of connecting with the divinity in nature.

His club drew many visitors and students and led to a mushrooming of surfing clubs along the coast.

One such student, Murthy Megavan of Covelong, a fishing village in Chennai, is now a champion surfboarder and runs a surfing school.

“We will take his teachings and vision forward,” said Kishore.

“He helped build India’s surfing community. I feel empty, but will fulfil his desire of seeing surfing flourish in India,” he added.

“We remained silent and maintained the law and order of this country when anti-Muslim reforms such as triple talaq, Babri Masjid verdict, etc, were implemented.

Bijnor: Senior Congress leader Rashid Alvi launched a broadside against PMs Narendra Modi of India and Imran Khan of Pakistan at a media briefing in Amroha on Sunday, after meeting local party functionaries.

“PMs Narendra Modi and Imran Khan are hand-in-glove with each other. Khan claims to be concerned about Muslims in India, but I think he wants to start a Hindu-Muslim clash. Both of them make comments which benefit each other,” said the former party spokesperson.

Alvi added the country will be fragmented if CAA is imposed by the Centre despite opposition of many states, saying, “The atmosphere around the county at present is deplorable. BJP is taking the nation in the wrong direction. Over 50% of states are opposing CAA. But the Centre insists it will enforce the controversial Act using its powers. This will lead to confrontation between Centre and states, which can tear the country apart.”

He slammed Imran Khan, saying, “Modi and Khan are colluding, by delivering statements that benefit each other. They want to divide people, but we’ll not allow that to happen. India’s Muslims don’t need Imran Khan. We’re leading a better life than in Pakistan, and can resolve our difficulties ourselves.”

Another Congress leader, Acharya Pramod Krishnam, said, “BJP has fizzled out after Priyanka Gandhi became active. She will be India’s next PM.”

AGRA: Delhi bullion trader’s son, Shaurya , who was allegedly shot along with his mother and sister by his father, Neeraj Agarwal , inside their SUV on January 1, succumbed to his injuries at Delhi’s Apollo hospital on Sunday - five days after the ill-fated incident. Neeraj after shooting at his family had killed himself.

Ten-year-old Shaurya was the only person who was found alive when the police broke open the car’s glass window. The car was parked near Vrindavan exit point on Yamuna Expressway . Police had found three bodies, that of Neeraj, his wife Neha and his daughter, Dhanya , 6, in the car.

According to police, Shaurya was the only eye witness to the incident and with his death, investigators and forensic experts will now have to rely on scientific evidence to recreate the crime and found out the truth. Though, prima facie, police believe that it was murders-cum-suicide by the trader, an FIR of murder was registered against five persons, including four erstwhile business associates of Neeraj, on the basis of a complaint filed by deceased’s family members.

Talking to TOI, Mathura SP (city) AK Meena said that they wrote to Agra Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to recreate the crime scene to corroborate the available scientific evidence. “Ballistic experts will connect the dots after they assess the distance of the firing of bullets and the directions they were fired from,” he said, adding that police are investigating all angles as family members have lodged a case of murder.

Neeraj’s brother-in-law, Amit Agarwal told TOI that his nephew, who sustained bullet injuries on his head, died at 1:30 am on Sunday. He said that they were hopeful for his survival after doctors conducted a second surgery on him on January 3, but his condition started deteriorating after that.

He added that Shaurya’s mortal remains will probably be received by his family members on Monday evening after a postmortem. He also said that autopsy could not be conducted by a panel of doctors, recommended by Mathura police today, being a Sunday. After hearing the news of her grand child’s death, Shaurya’s maternal grandmother Meera’s condition was stated to be “bad” too.

Neeraj hailed from Mathura’s Govind Nagar and ran a bullion trading firm RS Bullion and Jewellers, which was blacklisted after the Income Tax (I-T) department and other enforcement agencies launched an investigation into the company allegedly for “some shady transactions” of around Rs 123 crore, conducted post demonetization.

According to Neeraj’s father, Dinesh Chandra Agarwal, the Delhi trader along with his wife and children had shifted to the national capital almost a year ago and they were staying in Mayur Vihar. On January 1, they came to Mathura and after having a dinner with his in-laws, they headed towards Delhi. “We received the information of his and his wife and daughter’s death the next morning,” said Dinesh Chandra, adding that now his grand child has also gone.

Forget roads in localities, even prominent roads which are directly connected to highways, are not in good shape. What makes the situation worse is that despite repeated pleas by residents, agencies responsible for upkeep and maintenance of infrastructure like the Public Works Department (PWD) are either not responsive or simply pass the buck.TOI did a spot survey of almost a dozen roads in various areas and found either potholes or shoddily-done patch work on most roads. On Rajpur Road, the capital’s most prominent thoroughfare, there are many stretches — like the area near Dilaram Bazaar — where poor maintenance of the road is evident.“Rajpur Road has several shopping complexes, government offices, schools and other establishments. When even this road is riddled with potholes, what can one say of other ancillary roads? Also, digging work goes on here at random spots almost throughout the year adding to the mess on the road,” said Suman Karanwal, a resident.If one looks at roads inside colonies, almost all roads are in poor shape in localities like Jakhan, Dilaram Bazaar, EC Road and Karanpur, to name a few.In some areas, the condition of the road is quite precarious like the stretch of Raipur road, starting from Survey Chowk, where the road resembles a dust track in many parts.Asad Rehman, a resident of Raipur road, told TOI that he hadn’t seen PWD staffers repairing this road in years.“Workers come and fill up potholes with mud after the monsoons or in case of some VIP visit but it is only a temporary solution as the mud drains away after a couple of days,” he said.The situation is no different at Saharanpur Road, which connects with ISBT, Shri Mahant Indiresh Hospital, Wildlife Institute of India and many other places of prominence. Nitesh Singh, a transporter, said, “Most of my vehicles have been damaged due to the constant jerks that they have to undergo while passing over the potholes on Saharanpur road. The potholes also contribute to the frequent accidents taking place on this road. The PWD people do occasional repairing work but it is more of an eyewash — a temporary solution rather than a permanent one.”Incidentally, a walkability study titled “How Walkable is Dehradun?” conducted in 2018 by city-based think tank Social Development for Communities (SDC) Foundation, formerly known as Gati Foundation, had found that around 60% of people in the city rated the pedestrian infrastructure as ‘bad’ or ‘very bad’ and thought there was urgent need for improvement.“The survey found that only 35% of the trips in the city are covered by foot which is very low compared to other cities in the country which have an average of around 53%,” said Anoop Nautiyal, founder chairperson of the foundation, adding that with a beautiful topography and pleasant climate, Doon could have been an ideal walker-friendly city if its traffic was controlled and roads well-maintained.Meanwhile, officials of PWD when queried about the issue, had a stock response to offer. Hari Om Sharma, engineer-in-chief of PWD Uttarakhand, said, “We are filling up patches and constructing new roads at frequent intervals. Still, if some areas are left, we will conduct a survey and get the roads repaired soon.”Shouldn’t there be more pro-activeness in ensuring that roads in Doon don’t look like craters on the moon?

AGRA: After repeated complaints of malpractices, Mayor Naveen Jain has ordered a probe into the city’s “substandard road repairing work”.

Mayor Naveen Jain said on Sunday, “We have received complaints of recently repaired roads getting damaged. The AMC administration has been asked to investigate the quality of the work done and provide a report. The contractors tasked for the road repairing work have responsibility to take care of the roads for a period of one year. They will be made to carry out the maintenance work.”

Around 50 per cent of the roads repaired in the past two months need to be repaired again. The top layer of the roads has withered away in majority of the city wards. According to councillors, the roads’ poor condition is causing a lot of inconvenience to two wheelers as well.

Agra city is divided into 100 municipal wards - with 1,720 km of road network. The Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) using Rs 2 crore, two months ago, had repaired 40 km of the city’s main roads.

The work took place at Awas Vikas locality, in vicinity of Pachkuiyan crossing, Kothi Meena bazaar and a few other areas. Within two months, a majority of these roads repaired have started to wear off.

Civic body officials claimed that some of the roads have damaged due to unauthorized road cutting by different agencies. Penalties are being imposed on them now.

Ashok Nagar councillor Rajesh Kumar said, “Following poor quality repairing work, the road at Pachkuiyan crossing has started getting damaged within two months. The concrete of the upper layer of road has worn off causing accidents of two wheelers on a daily basis.”

Ratanpura councillor Dharamveer Singh said, “Substandard quality work has taken place under the pothole-free campaign. Funds have not been properly utilized. The issue of malpractices in the road repairing work will be raised at the board meeting.”

Even after state government’s orders, AMC was unable to complete the city’s road repairing work by the December 31 deadline. Officials had claimed that all the city roads will be made pothole-free by the end of January.

Around half of the city roads maintained by AMC are “not in good condition”. Roads at Madia Katra, Boghipura, Kailashpuri, Shahganj locality, Paschimpuri, Sikandra road, Maruti estate, interior roads of Pratapura locality, Lohamandi Belanganj, Peepal Mandi, Daresi, Heerabagh, Devri road, Nunihai, are among those in dire need of repair. Roads in Trans-Yamuna locality, Kamla Nagar, Jaipur house, Tajganj also need urgent attention.

342,['6/01/2020'],UP ministers go door to door to explain CAA to public,"This story is from January 6, 2020

AGRA: UP's deputy chief minister and other ministers on Sunday started a door-to-door campaign across the state including in Agra , Mathura , and Aligarh, the hot bed of anti-CAA agitations, to “educate” people about the Act.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday had announced that as part of the programme, senior leaders, including party chief and ministers, will reach out to the people and counter the “misleading campaign by the opposition” over the new Citizenship Amendment Act .

Addressing people in Agra, state’s deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said the purpose of this public awareness campaign is to eradicate doubts over CAA . Referring to the recent mob attack at Nankana Sahib in Pakistan, he said, this is an eye-opener for people about that how badly the minorities are being treated in the neighbouring country. “Who will provide shelter to such people, if we don’t do anything for them,” Sharma said, adding that religious structures have been vandalized there (in Pakistan) and women are disrespected.

Speaking to mediapersons after interacting with people by going door to door in Aligarh, cabinet minister Suresh Rana appealed to students to read this Act and understand it in depth as it is not aimed at taking away citizenship of anyone but to provide to those who are facing religious persecution. “This is for those minorities who have been harassed, mistreated or face religion conversions,” said Rana, adding that the opposition parties should not indulge in politics over it as this Act is beneficial for those who have been facing ill treatment for several years due to their minority status.

In Mathura, jal shakti minister Mahendra Singh said all doubts over CAA will be cleared during meetings and public awareness campaign. “CAA is wrongly projected and opposition is spreading lies about the Act. We are here to clarify it,” he said.

BJP workers in every district of the state have distributed pamphlets among people explaining what is CAA. Will it be implemented in the northeast states? Who are illegal migrants according to Citizenship Law,1955 and why protests are being held against CAA.

The party expects to reach out to three crore people with its door-to-door campaign, hold around one lakh small meetings across different states and a signature campaign. According to BJP leaders, the public awareness camp will continue till January 13.

345,['6/01/2020'],Delay in notification of Amaravati as capital works to Jagan’s advantage,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Amaravati: The dilemma over exiting the joint capital city, Hyderabad, before the stipulated 10 years might have made the TDP government delay issuing the gazette notification declaring Amaravati as state’s capital.

The delay in getting Parliament’s nod for Amaravati as capital has now become a boon for chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy to formulate plans for three capital cities on the pretext of decentralization of administration.

Experts said the YSRC government could not have considered relocating the capital city had the Centre notified Amaravati as the capital city in the last five years. Experts said now the Centre’s role has been minimized to only advisory from that of decision-making due to the delay in notifying Amaravati as the capital city.

According to legal experts who are well versed with the AP Reorganisation Act, the Centre’s role in interfering in all controversial issues was limited to three years from the date of appointment. Since President declared June, 2, 2014 as the appointed day for formation of the two states, AP and Telangana, the Centre’s veto powers in settling any dispute in the implementation of the Act ended in 2017.

The AP assembly had unanimously passed a resolution declaring Amaravati as capital city on September 9, 2014. This was within three months of Chandrababu Naidu taking over the reins of the residuary state of Andhra Pradesh.

The state government had declared the Land Pooling Scheme (LPS) and brought in a new legislation to constitute Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) in another three months--by December, 2014.

Surprisingly, the Naidu government which readied grand plans for the capital city area, did not take enough care to get Parliament’s approval and issuance of gazette by the Centre. “The AP government had forwarded the assembly resolution to the Centre seeking issuance of notification. It seems that it had not actively followed it up with the Centre apparently with a view not to lose the rights over the joint capital city Hyderabad till the resolution of disputes with Telangana,” said advocate Mallela Seshagiri Rao.

As per the Act, Hyderabad shall act as joint capital city till 2024. Many issues including sharing of assets listed in the Schedule IX and X of Reorganization Act were not settled as both the states were adamant in coming to a consensus. While the Telangana government continues to claim that all government assets located in Hyderabad belongs to it, AP says it has a rightful share in the PSUs located in the capital city and needed to be distributed between the two states.

Although Naidu started administration from Vijayawada and declared Amaravati as the new capital within six months of coming into power , experts advised him against losing rights over the joint capital city, Hyderabad, at least till the resolution of contentious issues.

“Declaring Amaravati as official capital city means complete exit of Hyderabad and also forfeiting rights on the joint capital city,” said a former MP.

KANPUR: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday attacked the Yogi Adityanath government for not giving attention to issues like education.

Citing the example of an incident reported from Kanpur on Saturday wherein an 18-year-old girl Mahima, a resident of Barra-8, committed suicide as she could not continue her education due to poor financial background.

“Arthik tangi se joojh rahi Mahima padhai nahi kar paayi to usne apni jaan de di. Uttar Pradesh mein BJP sarkar ka dhyan aise kisi mudde par nahi jata.

UP government does not focus on these issues. We all should pledge to protect the rights of education and security of girls like Mahima,” Priyanka tweeted.

“Politics means giving priority to issues concerning the common man, helping farmers in distress, providing education and jobs. But the BJP government is busy in creating divide,” she alleged.

Mahima, daughter of a rickshaw-puller Bansal Saxena, was found hanging from the ceiling fan on Saturday.

As per preliminary findings, Mahima was dejected as she had to give up her studies due of her poor financial background. She wanted to pursue intermediate.

Her two elder sisters, Soni and Shivani, are married and stay in other parts of the city.

AHMEDABAD: At 1.15 on Sunday morning, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, born in 1938, wielded his flute like a wand. But it was the Saptak audience that set up the magic. It was unwilling to leave. Time, age, and the chill were made to vanish. Rasikas’ exhalations set up a polyphony of raga requests, appreciation for the maestro, and the joy of sensing a classic concert moment.“I have been playing for 40 years and I’ve never seen an audience like this,” Pandit Chaurasia told TOI. Sound engineers had to step in. They seemed to wait for a second’s break to grab the mikes. Fortunately for them, the amiable exchange between panditji and the rasikas soon ended in a farewell presented with a standing ovation.“I saw schoolchildren in the audience!” panditji told TOI. “They were asking for this and that raga. I said, okay, let me write them down and I will play.” He said he was delighted by the earnestness shown by young people. “They want to talk to me directly and that pleases me,” he said. “It was very late in the night and they were awake. They may have been thirsty and hungry. So I wanted to make them feel happy with my music.”The musical spread was vast. Panditji began with Jaijaiwanti. Durga and Yaman followed in response to requests crisscrossing through the full house. Panditji also heeded the demand for a folk tune and closed the concert with “Om Jai Jagdish Hare”. As for the requests, panditji said: “I thought, wow, they at least know the names of some ragas, so let me play a little bit.”Panditji suggested that the classical tradition will thrive because of the millennial generation of Inquisitive Indians. “Young people come up to me and ask questions,” he said. “They want to know about the flute or the background of the presentation. When I was young, we could not talk to artists without permission. At Saptak, young people stayed back for me. I felt honoured.”People attending panditji’s programme had actually arrived the previous day, Saturday, Day 4 of Saptak.

Thiruvananthapuram: With most of the application forms for various government services still remaining complicated to the extent that a layman will have to avail an expert help to fill it in, the government has decided to simplify them and also not to insist for copies of supporting documents signed by a gazetted officer.

The personnel and administrative reforms department has issued a circular to all the secretaries, heads of departments, district collectors and heads of field offices not to insist for copies of supporting documents, including identity proofs, certified by gazetted officers along with any government application. Instead, the order says that self-certification of the applicant in such documents would suffice.

The order issued last month says that strict instruction is being given as an earlier order in this regard was not being followed in most of the application forms. The order says that even though most of the government schemes have been linked to Aadhaar, many of the application forms still insist on multiple supporting documents. “On most occasions, the general public is forced to take the help of intermediaries to fill the forms because of the complex nature of the forms,” the order says.

The circular also says that it has also been noticed that in several application forms, against the column for marking gender, there are options only for marking ‘male’ or ‘female’ and a third column for the transgenders is not available. The state was the first to frame a transgender policy in 2015 to uphold the rights of transgender community members, and since then the government had opened up various fronts exclusively for transgenders, including issuing driving licences exclusively marking TG against the sex of licence holders, engaging the community members in election duty in the last general elections, etc. As per a survey conducted by the department of social justice in 2015, there are more than 25,000 transgenders in the state, but majority of them are yet to enrol and reveal their identity.

Subsequent governments have been introducing multiple projects to improve the speed of governance including an e-tapal system for electronic communication between the departments.

349,['6/01/2020'],‘People should raise voice against corruption’,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Nashik: With the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) organising several programmes for spreading awareness about the ill-effects of corruption in the society, superintendent of police (ACB, Nashik Range) Sunil Kadasane said people should break their habit of paying bribe to get their work done . In an interview with TOI’s Santosh Sonawane, Kadasane said people should raise their voice against corruption. Excerpts

Why bribery demand cases are less in Nashik?

It is not, in fact, in 2019 we got more complaints than what we did in the year 2018. Having said that, we expect more people to come forward and lodge complaints if they are being harassed by public servants for bribe.

What is stopping people from approaching the ACB?

There is tendency among large section of the society to give money for getting their work done in government offices. While this also amounts to corruption and people are also well aware about this, they fear that if they raise their voice and approach the ACB, their pending work in the government office concerned would get stuck and they would be further harassed by the officials. People should bear in mind that the ACB helps the complainants in getting their done from the office concerned.

The conviction rate in corruption cases has always been low. What is the reason?

There are many reasons. On many occasions, the complainants turn hostile or the accused get the benefit of doubt in the court due to some lacunae in the evidence provided. However, now we have started scrutinizing the documents of the complainant strictly. We also meet the witnesses to check if they are being threatened by the accused. The Pairavi, liasoning officer of the ACB in the court, constantly co-ordinates with the complainants, witnesses, public prosecutor and the investigating officer to ensure a positive outcome of the case. Again, the conviction rate for Nashik ACB increased in 2019 as compared to the figures in 2018.

How do you tackle cases of corruption where both the giver and receiver benefit mutually?

There is little we can do in such cases. Nonetheless, we have the power to conduct inquiries to check for disproportionate assets of government officials. If we find that a government officials or employee has amassed more wealth than his legal source of income, we do conduct discreet inquiries and subsequently register cases against them.

What more is the ACB doing to spread awareness among people?

In the past few months, ACB Nashik has taken strong action against very senior officials when they were found accepting bribes. This has inspired confidence among people that no matter how senior or influential an official is, action will be taken against them. We are confident that now more and more people would come forward to lodge complaints.

MANGALURU: Karnataka Cultural Foundation (KCF), an organisation of Kannadigas in foreign countries, has succeeded in tracing a man in Saudi Arabia . The man had gone incommunicado with his family for several days.

Veerappa Gowda, 52, from Poorlappady in Dakshina Kannada district, was working in a private company in Dammam for several years. Though he was in touch with his family members regularly, all of a sudden there were no calls from him for the past one month.

In fact Gowda was suffering from an ailment and he was not in a position to make calls while undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit of Central Hospital in Dammam. His family members, who got anxious about not being able to contact him, sent a message on WhatsApp to KCF worker Sulaiman Machar from Al Jubail , when they stopped receiving phone calls from Gowda.

Soon after receiving a message from Gowda’s family, the KCF Al Jubail sector alerted its zonal relief wing. Following this, a team of KCF workers led by Basha Gangavali started searching for Gowda at various places in Dammam, including hospitals. Finally, the team found Gowda admitted in Central Hospital in Dammam.

Mohammed Ashraf, KCF Relief Wing convener, told TOI that the KCF team found him at the hospital on November 29. “Our members took care of Gowda in the hospital. Later, our members informed the family of Gowda and also made arrangements to send him back to India, after his recovery, through the Indian Embassy. All necessary official clearances were done through the embassy, and he was sent to Mangaluru on January 3,” he said.

Gowda, who reached Mangaluru on Friday, said, “KCF members helped me in the hospital even though they did not have any previous acquaintance with me. I was not able to walk due to my ill-health. I am really thankful to those KCF members who helped me by taking care of my health in the hospital, and making arrangements so that I could come home.”

Abdul Hamee Bajpe, editor of KCF’s ‘Ishara’, and KCF membres Shafeeq Katipalla and Ashraf Navunda received Gowda at the airport.

Bhubaneswar: ArcelorMittal, Vedanta and Tata Steel are among the companies who have bid for 20 working mines in the state, the existing lease of which expires on March 31. A total of 283 bids have been received till Friday, the last day of submitting bids for these mining blocks.

“Adani, JSW, Essel mining and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd are also among the big companies who have bid for these blocks,” a source in the state steel and mines department said.

“We have received 283 bids for these 20 blocks. The technical evaluation of these bids will be completed by January-end following which the final round of bidding will take place. The entire process would be over by February-end,” state mines director Deepak Mohanty said.

The existing lease period ran for more than 50 years and will expire at the end of March. Successful bidders can operate these blocks from April 1 after obtaining necessary clearances. The lease period will stay valid for another 50 years.

Of the 20 blocks, 12 are iron ore, two manganese and the remaining six are composite blocks of iron ore and manganese. “Auction process of Badampahar iron ore block is likely to be deferred because of legal issues,” said another official.

Gorumahisani iron ore block has received the highest number of bids — 22 — followed by 20 bids for the Nadidih iron ore and manganese composite block. Among others, Jaribahal, Roida II, Jururi, Jilling-Langalota and Nadidih (all iron ore blocks) have received more than 15 bids each, a source said.

After the technical evaluation process, half of the bidders are likely to make it to the next level of bidding, the source added.

The state steel and mines department had earlier issued notification for auction of these 20 blocks in two phases (October 4 and 14), but the process was annulled on December 2 due to some procedural error. Some of the companies had reportedly participated in the bidding process directly as well as through some of their subsidiaries to eliminate competition. This was objected to by other participants, resulting in the bidding process getting annulled.

On December 6, the government added new conditions while coming out with fresh bidding notification. This time a bidder could submit only one bid for a block, either directly or through subsidiaries.

“As all these blocks are working mines. So the bidders won’t have to work very hard in terms of land acquisition and developing logistical support. Successful bidders can start mining operation after obtaining the necessary clearances. This is the reason the auction process has received tremendous response,” said a mining industry source.

354,['6/01/2020'],JDA can tweak land use for civic amenities,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Jaipur: Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) can now change land use in it’s region for several prescribed activities mentioned in the newly formulated development promotion and control regulation of the master plan 2025.

The land use change will be possible for many activities including guesthouses, health centres, schools and others.

Permission for land use change on agricultural land can be given by the JDA. However, land use of non-agricultural can only be carried out after taking permission from the state government’s committee. Land conversion in the state capital were stalled since 2017 following Rajasthan High Court orders prohibiting land use change against the master plan.

An official said, “The JDA, after conducting a legal examination of the court’s orders, sought opinion on whether land use changes could be made for prescribed activities under the Development Promotion and Control Regulations of the Master Plan. The fresh orders were issued only after getting a positive legal opinion.”

It was informed that under the Development Promotion and Control Regulation of Master Plan 2025 in residential areas, land use can be changed for many activities including auditoriums, banks, ATMs, community centres, rest houses, gyms, hostels, libraries, local shopping centres, nursing homes, primary-level schools and offices. There are a total of 40 activities which also includes cinema halls, restaurants and petrol pumps. From now, if any proposal for land use change is received that is prescribed under the regulation, it can be approved by the town planning wing at the JDA. An official said, “This would not only help JDA to fill it coffers, but will also benefit the public to carry out construction in a systematic manner after taking permission.”

After the high court imposed the ban, the civic body sought an advise on various points including the abolition of compounding provisions for violation of building bylaws, restoration of ecological zones, and restoring land use change of the facility areas as per the master plan.

LUCKNOW: Dog parents who haven’t got their pets registered or registration renewed with Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) must do so by January 15, failing which the civic authorities will take the animals into custody and release them only after penalty is paid.That the LMC means business is evident from the fact that in the past two days, it rounded up 12 pooches whose owners didn’t comply with a similar order issued to them earlier.The pets were freed after the owners registered them for an annual fee and also coughed up a fine of Rs 500 each.The registration fee varies for every breed. While the charge for medium-large domestic dogs such as the Dobermann and Labrador is Rs 500 each, lap dogs like Pomeranian and Spitz can be registered for Rs 300. The annual registration fee for an Indie is the lowest at Rs 200. Thus, the total amount recovered from defaulters in two days was around Rs 15,000.In 2019, the LMC began its crackdown on unregistered pets since July and was able to register 3,400 dogs. The figure is though less than 50% of estimated 7,000 pet canines in the city. So, in 2020, drive will begin in January.Teams have been formed for each of eight zones to will survey homes and take into custody all unregistered dogs.Chief veterinary officer of LMC Arvind Rao said they were targeting 100% pet dog registration in 2020. “Guidelines have been issued to our crackdown teams. We are starting early to ensure every pet pooch is registered,” he added.In 2019, the civic body had collected around Rs 6 lakh in registration fees. If it achieves its pet dog target for 2020, the LMC cash box should jingle with more than Rs10 lakh.Dog owners can register their pets at the LMC head office in Lalbagh or any zonal office. Once the fee is paid, a registration certificate is issued, which must be renewed every year.

357,['6/01/2020'],Foreigners issue: Strange are causes and magnitude of protests in India,"This story is from January 6, 2020

On January 26, 1950, India commenced its journey as a 'Sovereign Democratic Republic'. On January 3, 1977, Indira Gandhi government redefined India as ""Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic"". Just 26 days after engrafting ""socialist' and 'secular' in the Constitution's Preamble, it superseded Justice HR Khanna by appointing M Hameedullah Beg as Chief Justice of India.

The Preamble, which promised to secure to all its citizens ""fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual"" also added another important aspect- ""unity and integrity of the nation"". Sadly, these terms - ""secular"" and ""unity and integrity of the nation"" - have become intellectual political tools.

Politically influenced protests since 1977 had always been only on secularism issue and never on unity and integrity of the nation. Today, it has manifested into protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

Since the 1970s, unity and integrity of India faces serious threat from continuous illegal migration from Bangladesh to north-eastern states, especially Assam, gravely threatening their culture, demography and landownership.

Students agitation and popular support to it came to a boil in 1983 through Nellie massacre of illegal Bangladeshi migrants, who had swelled the electoral rolls.

Rajiv Gandhi government finalised Assam Accord in 1985, promising identification of foreigners who came in after March 24, 1971 and deport them after deleting their names from electoral rolls.

Nothing changed on ground. Illegal migration continued with political patronage. Process for their identification was deliberately made complicated and lethargic. On November 8, 1998, then Assam governor Lt Gen SK Sinha (former deputy chief of Army Staff) sent a hair-raising report to AB Vajpayee government apprising it about grave consequences of unabated illegal migration to Assam.

Sinha's report, as quoted by the Supreme Court in Sarbananda Sonowal-I judgement [2005 (5) SCC 665], said, ""The silent and invidious demographic invasion of Assam may result in the loss of geo-strategically vital districts of lower Assam. Influx of these illegal migrants is turning these districts into a Muslim majority region. It will then only be a matter of time when a demand for their merger with Bangladesh may be made. The rapid growth of international Islamic fundamentalism may provide for driving force for this demand.

In this context, it is pertinent that Bangladesh has long discarded secularism and has chosen to become an Islamic State. Loss of Assam will severe the entire land mass of north-east, from the rest of India and the rich natural resources of that region will be lost to the nation.""

The Vajpayee government did little to address the grave situation. Sinha's predictions have come true. Nine border districts in Assam have become Muslim majority. Intellectuals remained silent. Rights activists did not bother. Craving for vote bank, politicians did not protest against government's lethargy.

Sinha had said, ""Some political parties have been encouraging and even helping illegal migration with a view to building vote banks"". There were enough funds available to bribe corrupt officials to forge residence papers of these foreigners. Alarmingly, Sinha's finding that illegal immigrants were ""primary contributing factor behind outbreak of insurgency in the state"" did not stir anyone.

SC in Sonowal-I said, ""there can be no manner of doubt that the state of Assam is facing 'external aggression and internal disturbances' on account of large scale illegal migration of Bangladeshi nationals "" and that Centre is duty bound to take all measures to protect Assam.

It struck down Illegal Migrants Determination through Tribunal (IMDT) Act and ordered identification of foreigners through Tribunals under Foreigners Act. Congress-led UPA government, duty-bound under Assam Accord and directed by the SC, did just the opposite. It exempted Assam from the purview of Foreigners Act to allow Bangladeshis a free run in Assam. SC in Sonowal-II [2007 (1) SCC 174] struck down the decision and forced Centre to set up Foreigners Tribunal.

No protest was organized since 2005 for immediate identification of foreigners in Assam. Activists spent a lot of ink and lung power to find ways and means to protect these foreigners. One example was Harsh Mandher, who petitioned the SC for release of foreigners lodged in detention centres of Assam on two grounds - they have already undergone sentence and condition of detention homes was appalling.

SC asked about living condition in detention centres, Assam said it was constructing a huge one with modern amenities. Departing from script, the SC asked the government on steps to locate nearly one lakh Bangladeshis who have mingled with population after tribunals declared them foreigners.

Finding that his petition to give succor to foreigners was having opposite effect, Mandher accused SC of bias and sought recusal of then CJI, who said, ""if the court agrees with you, then it is ok. If it does not, then it is biased?"" Some activist lawyers scathingly criticized present CJI-led bench for asking anti-CAA protesters not to take law into their hands. CJI did not stop protests. He merely asked protesters to remain non-violent to enable court to hear petitions challenging CAA in a congenial atmosphere.

Activist lawyers passionately talk about independence of judiciary. They don't waste a breath in accusing the SC of bowing to pressures when they do not get relief in any of their petitions against select governments or tycoons.

We saw how Gorakhapur children's deaths became a hot political issue, but not the Kota deaths. Why no protests to force governments equip hospitals better? Activist lawyers advocate purity of judiciary. But, when faced with criminal cases, we know of some of the prominent ones rushing to privately meet Judges to seek relief on judicial side. This double-talk must stop. Protest is a fundamental right and must be against both government action and inaction.

Around 2,000 people participated in the marathon

PUNE: Athletes of the Bombay Engineering Group and Centre (BEG) popularly known as ‘ Bombay Sappers ’ made a clean sweep by winning all nine medals in the three categories of the marathon organized on Sunday at Dighi hills.

Naib Subedar Rahul Bal, Naik Dadaso Bhatt and recruit Ravi Dahiya won gold medals in the 42km, 21km and 10km events, respectively. All these soldiers are from BEG Centre.

BHUBANESWAR: The transport department has expressed displeasure over poor utilisation of road safety funds by police .

The department has found that police are yet to submit utilisation certificate (UC) for Rs 1.07 crore released in 2015-16. The transport department had released the funds to police to purchase road safety equipment and conduct awareness drives.

“In spite of repeated reminders, neither the UCs have been submitted nor the money has been refunded. The DGP will be informed and requested to refund the money within 15 days. No further money will be released to police from the state road safety fund unless they submit the UC or refund the money,” read minutes of a recent meeting. The transport department has also found non-submission of UC of Rs 56.99 lakh by the commissionerate police. Till non-receipt of the UC, no further funds will be released in favour of the commissionerate police, the meeting proceedings said.

Police headquarters said they would find out the exact reasons of the delay in utilisation of funds and submission of UC. “We are aware of the transport department’s observations. We will comply with the department’s decision,” a senior police officer said.

In a related development, the transport department has decided to launch a scheme, namely citizen reporting on road safety. “We plan to launch a mobile application and enable people to click photos/videos of traffic violations across the state. National Informatics Centre (NIC) and Odisha Computer Application Centre (OCAC) are giving finishing touches to the app,” said state transport commissioner Sanjeeb Panda.

The transport commissioner said nearly Rs 15 crore will be spent on maiden CCTV-led intelligent highway traffic management system between Sanabaruan and Rameswar for taking action against traffic violators. The CCTV surveillance project has been christened as Deesha (driving electronic enforcement to save human lives). Panda said there is a proposal to set up a call centre for addressing issues relating to road safety and analysis of cause of accidents.

Bengaluru: Delivering the inaugural address at the Women Science Congress, as part of the 107th Indian Science Congress here, Indian Council of Agricultural Research director Trilochan Mohapatra said India is waking up late to the power of women in science and technology.

“Women have for long been ignored by societies around the world. Even the Royal Society, London wasn’t giving scholarships to women until very late; it only happened in the 19th century. Our country is waking up very late to this too. Although now we have a lot of schemes to encourage women, core areas (STEM) don’t see a lot of women,” he said.

Pointing out how more than 45 women have been awarded the Nobel prize since Madam Curie became the first woman to do so, he said: “There is a lot of talent, but it is not being harnessed.”

He said women are discriminated against even in modern times, which must stop if we want more women to take up science. “Even as teachers, when our teachings don’t get reflected in our own behaviour, values become barren. If we speak of high-class science we have to inculcate it from school and women must be encouraged from there. But if you look at the number of women in science compared to their total population in India, it is not a healthy number,” he said.

Stating that men have a huge role to play in how society inculcates aspirations among women, he said: “There is a Ravan in each one of us and we need to discipline him. Unless we do that, we cannot facilitate women; we won’t be able to provide good workplaces for them.”

Jaipur: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday assured that the Centre had taken steps to boost the economy without waiting for the Budget.

Addressing a news meet here, the minister said GST collection, which crossed the Rs 1 lakh-crore per month mark in the last two months, will remain ‘good’ in the coming days.

“The government has been regularly taking steps to help sectors which are facing challenges. Without waiting for the Budget, we are taking the steps,” she said.

Sitharaman was here as part of the BJP’s nationwide campaign to create awareness on Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019. She said the Act was not against Muslims and the Modi government had offered citizenship to several Muslims asylum seekers in the last six years. Stating that the Centre does not differentiate between BJP ruled states and non-BJP ruled states, she said dues of states were not being held back by the Centre and funds were being given as per the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission.

“The revenue share of states has been cleared up to October 2019. The delay of November and December has been communicated to the states in the GST council meeting held on December 18,” said Sitharaman.

Lashing out at the Congress for misleading and lying to the nation over the CAA as part of its appeasement policy, she said, “The Congress leaders are conveniently highlighting some portions of the Act to create the confusion. I would like to clear that the Act is not against any community. Our government has given citizenship to several Muslims since 2014. Over 2,000 people from Pakistan, including Muslims, have been granted asylum since 2014. Another 900 people were given citizenship from Afghanistan which included 600 Muslims. Over 200 Bangladeshis were also given citizenship, mostly Muslims. Modi government has not excluded Muslims from granting citizenship,” said Sitharaman.

Taking a dig at AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi, Sitharaman said those who had never hoisted the national flag have announced to hoist it on the intervening night of January 25-26. Earlier in the day, the minister visited few Muslim dominated areas in Sanganer and told them about the merits of the CAA.

JAIPUR: City police are close to solving the murder case of a 10-year-old boy, whose body was found in haystack in Muhana police station area on Saturday morning. Although no one has been formally arrested, sources claimed that cops have narrowed down the list of suspects . The murder victim had gone missing on Friday morning.

Arpit Choudhary, a Class IV student, had left his house at Keshyawala village around 7am on Friday to feed grains to pigeons near a temple. When he did not return even after an hour, his family started a search and registered a missing person’s report the same evening. Yogesh Dhadhich, DCP, Jaipur South said, “We have rounded up a couple of suspects and are interrogating them to find the culprit. Questioning will reveal the motive behind the murder but no one has been formally arrested yet. We are working on solving this case at the earliest.”

Sources also claimed that a mentally unstable youth had also been detained, though officials did not confirm or deny this claim. The family also had no idea who could have possibly murdered the child who routinely went to feed pigeons near his house.

One of the theories that cops are following up on is that the child was killed by a known person who attempted to sexually assault him and when the boy resisted, the accused murdered him. According to sources, there were injury marks on the child’s body and it is possible that his throat was slit, though it did not appear that the boy was sexually assaulted.

Rohith, the accused, was working on the college premises as a construction worker . In November last year, at around 5pm, when the girl left the college to go home, he followed her. He allegedly pulled her to the side and tried to sexually assault her. The incident took place at the campus. The girl managed to escape from the accused and ran home.

Representational Image

BIJNOR: To counter widespread protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), BJP has now launched a campaign to drum up support for the controversial Act.

The party has already issued a toll free number, requesting people to give a missed call as a mark of symbolic support. Local leaders in each district have also embarked on a drive to garner support among people. It is in this backdrop that UP minister Kapil Dev addressed a gathering in Bijnor on Sunday while party’s Amroha in charge Vijay Kashyao led a door-to-door campaign in favour of the Act besides making residents aware about the toll free number.

A programme in favour of the CAA was held at Ghasiwala colony, 8km from district headquarters, on Sunday evening. Addressing a gathering, minister in charge of Bijnor Kapil Dev said, “Citizen Amendment Act will not take away citizenship of any Indian. It has been enacted to give citizenship to Hindus and Sikhs and others (non-Muslims) who are being persecuted in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The latest attack on Nankana Sahib Gurdwara, the birthplace of Guru Nanak, in Pakistan by a Muslim mob and abduction and forced conversion of a Sikh girl proves that Hindus and Sikhs are being persecuted in that country. The newly enacted CAA will give relief and support to such types of people.”

Dev added, “The opposition is inciting people to resort to violent protest. We are here to make people aware about CAA on the instructions of PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. We are going door to door to allay fears about CAA among people.”

The minister further claimed that more than 2,000 Bengalis displaced from Bangladesh in 1959 and 1971 and now living in Bijnor will be granted citizenship under CAA.

However, villagers claimed that the Bengalis settled in 1959 were already Indian citizens with voting rights and they were availing the benefits of state and central government schemes. Five colonies were set up in Bijnor to settle them. The CAA, however, will be boon to those who came later. they added.

A revenue officer also confirmed that the Bengalis living in Bijnor were citizens of India.

Besides Bijnor, those displaced from Bangladesh were settled in 11 districts of UP, including Lakhimpur Kheri, Bareilly, Pilibhit, Sambhal, Meerut, Rampur, Lucknow, Bahraich and Kanpur.

Meanwhile, party’s Amroha in charge Vijay Kashyap went door to door to garner support for CAA in Amroha city. He lashed out at SP leaders for promising pension to anti-CAA protesters and termed the statement as anti-national.

368,['6/01/2020'],Ariyamangalam biomining: City needs temporary waste centre,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Trichy: The 47.5-acre dump yard in Ariyamangalam, in a week or two, will undergo the biomining scientific reclamation process sanctioned at an estimated cost of Rs 49 crore under the Smart City mission. As the quality of biomining will be affected in retrieving the land due to the continuance of waste dumping at the worksite, solid waste management (SWM) experts suggested that the civic body should come up with a temporary waste processing site to avoid the new batch of waste from reaching Ariyamangalam dump yard.

The Trichy Corporation sources acknowledged that around 65 MT (metric tonnes) to 165 MT of waste per day was heading to the dump yard in the past few months. As the fresh batch of waste being dumped at Ariyamangalam will dilute the quality of land reclamation, SWM experts involved in the biomining activity in other cities across India suggested the local body to identify a temporary waste processing centre.

“Biomining will yield a desirable result only when the dump yard is handed over in an abandoned state. If waste dumping is happening simultaneously while biomining process is underway, the net result will be futile,” a SWM expert in biomining said.

The existing 31 micro compost centres (MCC) collecting and recycling the waste locally covers only about 80% of the city corporation’s wards. Around 25 MT of waste from the Gandhi Market has no other option than being dumped at the Ariyamangalam. As a solution, experts studying the biomining project at Pammal and Poonamalee localities said that a temporary site to accommodate and process city’s waste that was not covered by the MCCs should be arranged.

“Fresh waste is still heading to Ariyamangalam dump yard as we have no other options. We do not have immediate plans for alternative temporary waste processing site,” an official source said. Trichy Corporation maintained that a fresh batch of waste will be dumped in the space away from the biomining work area.

Trichy: A woman candidate who lost the election to the panchayat president of Neikuppai in Perambalur district by three votes has alleged that the election for her panchayat was not conducted in a fair manner. T S Vijayalakshmi petitioned the Perambalur district administration claiming that the candidate who won the panchayat president post by defeating her had promised to bribe the voters if elected, on Sunday. Vijayalakshmi, contesting in autorickshaw symbol, had lost to P Pachaiammal by a slim margin of three votes. She alleged suspected malpractice on voting day by Pachaiammal’s relative P Maharani employed at Veppanthattai panchayat union office. She said that he had managed to appoint favourable persons as election officials and appeased them to act in favour of the candidate Pachaiammal. “Votes (ballot papers) polled in favour of me were not properly handled by the officials. Hence, they became invalid votes. I lost the election by a small margin of three votes due to such unfair practice,” Vijayalakshmi alleged.

Submitting a petition to the officials at the district collector’s camp office, the woman sought to recount the votes polled. The petitioner alleged that the Pachaiammal’s camp had promised the villagers of Neikuppai and issued tokens to provide 1g gold coin if successfully elected. Stating that details of the vote-counting process were not divulged by the revenue department officials on election duty, the petitioner reiterated the demand to probe the vote-counting process.tnn

JAISALMER: BJP state president Satish Poonia said that the Congress is conspiring to break the country and wants to get into power, and that Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s statement that the country will break into pieces, is the symbol of mental insolvency.

Poonia said this during the ‘public awareness campaign’ on CAA at Pokhran in Jaisalmer district on Saturday evening, while addressing the gathering there. He condemned the statement of CM Gehlot that if CAA is not withdrawn the country will break into pieces, and said that this statement is an open support to terrorists and separatists. Poonia said that the ‘gangs’ shouting slogans of ‘tukde tukde’ at universities such as JNU, AMU etc., are led by Rahul Gandhi and that Gehlot is supporting this in the state. Poonia said that in 1947, the Congress divided the country based on religion to get into power and now, to get back into power, the party is moving in the same direction. He added that CM’s statement is like treason and it is playing with the spirit of Constitution, law and democracy. Gehlot is flattering the Gandhi family, he said, adding that sitting on a constitutional post and giving such statements shows his mental insolvency.

Meanwhile, Poonia visited the canal area that is affected by locusts and assured the farmers of a compensation for the damages caused. BJP district president Jugal Kishore Vyas and other BJP leaders accompanied Poonia. While visiting the locust-affected areas, he discussed about the damage caused to the crops due to the pests with the farmers along the international border and took their suggestions. He also took stock of the measures taken by the state and Central governments for locust control.

Farmers told Poonia that they could not avail the PM insurance scheme because they were busy controlling locusts, and that they did not get fertilisers, seeds and small-term loans and did not get any compensation from the state government or the Centre. Poonia, sitting with the farmers in Sada area at Sultana border, assured the farmers that BJP will provide all help possible to the farmers. Poonia said that the BJP and Modi-led government are with them. He said that he has spoken to Union home minister Amit Shah, Barmer-Jaisalmer MP Kailash Choudhary and Pokhran Jodhpur MP Gajendra Singh Shekhawat about the matter.

Thiruvananthapuram: A 58-year-old Sabarimala pilgrim from Tamil Nadu was killed by a wild tusker along the Erumeli–Pampa Kanana Patha (forest route) during the early hours of Sunday. Bhadrappan of Subrahmaniapalayam near Coimbatore has been identified as the deceased.

His body was recovered a few hours later and was shifted to Kanjirampally Taluk Hospital for postmortem.

The herd of wild elephants, including the tusker which killed him, were camping nearby and had initially hindered recovery of the body. Bhadrappan’s body will be handed over to his relatives after the postmortem.

According to an officer attached with Peruvanthanam police station, it was the chaos and confusion created by the oncoming charging elephants which led to Bhadrappan running onto the path of the wild tusker near Pookutty Thavalam of Vallithode.

“Bhadrappan along with a group of pilgrims were resting near Pookutty Thavalam, located between Mukkuzhi and Karimala, when the elephants came. Then, the group split and ran in all directions, but Bhadrappan could not escape. He was mauled by the tusker and succumbed to injuries at the spot itself. Nobody else was injured in the incident. The group members soon alerted forest officers nearby, but by the time they reached the spot, Bhadrappan had already died,” the officer said.

372,['6/01/2020'],Replace refrigerator or pay consumer entire amt: Forum,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Nashik: The district consumer disputes redressal forum has ordered an electronics company to either replace the refrigerator that was delivered to a consumer with manufacturing defect or return the entire amount with 10% rate of interest from the day the complaint was raised by the consumer.

“The fact that the refrigerator developed a technical snag on the second day and the technicians visited the customer’s house but were unable to fix the problem proves that the company had delivered a product with a manufacturing defect. Since it cannot be repaired, the company should repay the entire amount to the consumer,” said the three-member panel in its judgment on December 31, 2019.

On March 16, 2019, Harshadrai Doshi bought a Samsung refrigerator worth Rs 35,124 from Reliance Retail Zone. The product was delivered and installed on March 17.

However, on the very next day, Doshi observed that the door of the refrigerator would not close and even the compressor was making noises.

Since the company failed to take cognisance of the complaint over phone, Doshi raised a complaint via email. Thereafter, technicians from Samsung visited his house to fix the problem. About three technicians came one after another but could not fix the problem.

Finally, Doshi went to the Samsung office on April 4 seeking repairs for the manufacturing defect of the refrigerator. There he was told that the fault could not be repaired. Doshi then registered a complaint with the consumer forum on May 8.

Replying to the notices slapped by the forum, Samsung technicians said that the product was verified and tested before delivery and refuted the allegations of the refrigerator having a manufacturing defect.

On the issue of problems with the refrigerator, the company said that the refrigerator was working sound and claimed that Doshi had not produce any evidence to show that the instrument was malfunctioning. However, the forum ruled out in Doshi’s favour stating that the onus of providing certificates was with the company and that by not mentioning the report of the technicians who visited the spot, the company had failed to substantiate its claim.

“Given these conditions, we believe the company had delivered the product with manufacturing defect... hence pay the consumer the entire amount of Rs 35,124 along with 10% interest from the date the complaint was raised with the company and an additional Rs 7,000 for mental harassment and Rs 3,000 for other costs incurred,” said the forum.

They had also left pamphlets asking the state government to evict north Indians by asking them to vacate their shops. They claimed that the increasing presence of north Indians has been affecting employment opportunities of locals. The pamphlet also said that the party workers would not hesitate to resort to violence if people from northern India did not shut shops and go back.

378,['6/01/2020'],Forest dept to set up speed barricades,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Kozhikode: The forest department is moving ahead with plans to install speed control barricades on the Sultan Bathery-Pulpally road which is one of the wildlife rich corridors in the state cutting through the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS).

Big cats and other wild animals often cross the road on the 5km stretch which witnessed a tiger chasing a bike last year in a viral video. A leopard was killed in November after being hit by a lorry on the stretch near Chethalayam. In another incident, a KSRTC bus was attacked by a wild elephant in the same stretch in July, last year.

Stiff opposition by people was coming in the way of the department to enforce speed restrictions on any of the roads cutting through the WWS despite it being a prime tiger habitat in the state. Once realized, this will be the first initiative to curb speeding of vehicles on roads cutting through WWS.

WWS warden P K Asif said that the department took up the matter with the district collector and sought permission for installing barricades in the stretch to control vehicle speed. “We wrote a letter to the district collector seeking permission to install barricades and are hopeful of receiving permission,” he said. Forest department officials said that they have identified four spots along the stretch from the forest checkpost to Pukalamalam where barricades with reflectors will be installed.

“Having a speed control mechanism on the road cutting though the wildlife rich forest is a must. While the law restricts vehicle speed limit to 30km/h on forest roads, there have been instances of vehicles speeding over 90km/h on the stretch,” said a forest department official at Kurichiad forest range.

Conservationists said that having a speed control mechanism on the stretch will benefit both motorists as well as wildlife. “Having speed control barricades would come as a benefit to motorists as well as wildlife. A motorcyclist lost his life after hitting a post when he tried to avoid hitting a gaur which was crossing the road some years ago,” said wildlife conservation society senior conservation officer Arul Badusha.

Meanwhile in another development, WWS authorities installed boards along the sides of NH-766 at Muthanga asking people not to park vehicles along the highway stretch or feed animals.

BHUBANESWAR: The Capital Region Urban Transport (Crut), which runs the ‘ Mo Cycle ’ service here, has decided to install web cameras at cycle docks to prevent vandalism.

Over the past year, around 25 cycles had been found damaged in the docks, as well as lying on the road or even in drains, Crut officials said.

They added that the miscreants were breaking the automatic locks of the cycles and taking them out for rides.

“We fear drug addicts and miscreants lift the cycles by breaking the locks. Only if you are booking the cycle with an app can you unlock it properly,” said an official.

“Web cameras will help us identify the vandals. Once they are identified, we hope the vandalism will stop. The miscreants will also be on their guard if they know they are under surveillance,” said the Crut official.

There are about 350 cycle docks in the city, and they accommodate around 2,000 cycles provided by three service providers. Most of the docks are located close to bus shelters, but there are also several standalone docks.

Crut sources said while bicycle ridership was on the rise, problems such as vandalism and citizens’ confusion about how to book cycles on the app were yet to be addressed. “We are now seeing around 1,200 rides a day. Ridership went up after the amended motor vehicle act came into force in September. This is encouraging,” the officer added.

Following the rise in ridership, two cycle service providers have offered free rides a day every week under their ‘go green’ scheme. With this, people can avail themselves of free bicycle rides on Wednesdays and Thursdays.

The Crut has also decided to integrate the apps of the three cycle service providers to avoid any confusion. “At present, riders have to separately download three different apps of the three companies. This is a cumbersome process. We want the three to be integrated into one Mo Cycle app,” an officer said.

The state government has placed a lot of stress on making the Mo Cycle scheme popular as non-motorised transport is one of the components of the smart city project.

380,['6/01/2020'],42cr to be disbursed among 18k farmers in divn for micro-irrigation,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Nashik: The state government has released a grant of Rs 41.63 crore for Nashik division for micro-irrigation projects that willl be taken up in Nashik, Ahmednagar, Nandurbar, Dhule and Jalgaon districts.

The sanctioning of the funds has paved the way for 18,570 farmers across the five districts to take up mico-irrigation works under the Pradhan Mantri Sukhshma Sinchan Yojana.

According to officials from the agriculture department, around 19,942 farmers had enrolled for the micro-irrigation scheme in the ficsal 2019-20. The scheme aims at enhancing efficient use of water in agriculture by promoting technological interventions like drip and sprinkler irrigation systems among other technologies.

In the fiscal 2018-19, 31,171 farmers from the division had enrolled for the scheme of which 21,131 farmers were selected. The government had sanctioned Rs 11.7 crore for the micro-irrigation project— far below the actual target of Rs 31.37 crore.

Farmers had been demanding government aid for the micro-irrigation project to tackle drought and and water scarcity which plagues the region too often.

“Since there were no government funds, it was an uphill task for us to convince the farmers to wait for the aid as well as take up measures to conserve water. Our department officials maintained the momentum by assuring the farmers of all the help required for the mico-irrigation activity,” said a senior officer from the agriculture department.

The funds sanctioned by the state will be distributed among the farmers who have been waiting for the aid from the last fiscal and also a few among those who have been selected for the programme for the current fiscal. Once the grant is disbursed among some of the farmers selected this fiscal, they will be able to start their works early and complete the activity on time.

The officer added that more funds would be required to meet the target and that they were confident of receiving the remaining corpus by end of February. The division requires another Rs 23 crore to ensure all the dues are settled.

381,['6/01/2020'],Casteist remarks: YSRC demands Naidu’s apology,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Amaravati: YSRC stepped up offence against TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu for allegedly using derogatory language against municipal administration commissioner and IAS officer Vijayakumar.

Ministers Narayana Swamy, Viswaroop, Anitha, Sucharitha have demanded unconditional apology from Naidu. Speaking to media here on Sunday, the ministers criticized Naidu’s attitude in abusing the Dalit officer. They said that Naidu abused the IAS officer because he was a Dalit. Narayana Swamy said that Naidu had always been against the Dalits and continues to work against them.

In a separate media conference, MLA Meruga Nagarjuna flayed Naidu for his comments against Vijay Kumar. He said that Naidu was a Dalit traitor and he should apologize to Vijay Kumar. He said they would lodge a police complaint against Naidu under SC/ST Act if he failed to tender apology.

He said Naidu’s comments were intolerable and Dalits would never forget this discrimination. He said Naidu was the only leader who mocked BR Ambedkar’s contribution towards the Constitution.

Recalling Naidu’s previous comments that no one would like to be born as a Dalit, Nagarjuna said that Naidu had lost his cool against the IAS officer as he belonged to the SC community. He said Naidu had opposed English medium in government schools as he did not want Dalit children to become champions.

Santhanuthalapadu legislator TJR Sudhakar Babu said that Naidu was unfit to be the opposition leader as he was working against the weaker sections and Dalits. He said that Naidu had used derogatory comments against G N Rao and DGP Gautam Sawang as well who also belong to weaker sections.

He said Naidu had been targeting IAS and IPS officers as he was unable to digest that they got prime posts under the YSRC government. Sudhakar Babu asked Naidu how he had constituted the Narayana committee on capital city after the Srikrishna Committee and Sivaramakrishna Committee submitted their reports.

Although Jagan was using the same powers, he is using the GN Rao and BCG reports for the overall development of the state, said Babu. He alleged that Naidu was instigating farmers to hit the streets to cover up his failure to build the capital city in the last five years.

382,['6/01/2020'],Biometric registration planned for autos operating with permit,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Kozhikode: The city traffic police are planning biometric registration of all autorickshaw drivers who are operating autorickshaws with Calicut city permit . The move is to ensure the safety of passengers depending on rickshaws, especially during night hours.

The plan is to complete the biometric registration of autorickshaw drivers by the first week of February. If more than one driver is operating an auto with Calicut city permit, both the drivers will have to register their biometric details under the scheme.

At present, there is no database of the autorickshaw drivers working in CC permit autos, said P Bijuraj, assistant commissioner of police (city traffic-south). On the completion of biometric registration, the police will be able to access the details of the drivers and get the details of vehicles carrying out service during night hours, said the official.

The autorickshaw drivers carrying out service during night hours are doing so after signing the register kept at the local police station or city traffic station. The system would be eased with the completion of biometric registration.

The auto drivers will be able to carry out biometric punching at the punching stations. The city traffic police are planning to set up biometric punching stations at selected locations on the completion of biometric registration.

As per the figures available 4,337 autorickshaws in the city have Calicut city permit. However, the officials are not sure of the actual number of auto rickshaws which now possess CC permit as many vehicles have stopped service.

Trading of the city permit is also a concern for the law enforcers, said the assistant commissioner of police. Some agents are operating to collect huge sums for handing over the permit, said Bijuraj.

According to police, many ‘amateur’ autorickshaw drivers, including government employees and others, carry out unauthorized service in the city limit during night hours. The drivers of CC permit autorickshaws are considering the presence of amateur drivers a concern for the safety of passengers.

The city traffic unit is also planning to introduce QR code for auto rickshaws with CC permit. The QR code will help the passengers get the details of the vehicle including the details of the driver.

The QR code will also help the passengers to easily trace the vehicle in case they forget their bags or other valuables in the vehicle during their journey, said Bijuraj. The police will also be able to trace the vehicle, he added.

BENGALURU: In a startling set of events, an 18-year-old girl from Kasaragod, part of neighbouring Kerala, approached chief minister BS Yediyurappa saying she was repeatedly raped over a year by three persons — two from Bengaluru and the other from Kannur, Kerala — and sought “justice”.

The case took another twist as Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP Shobha Karandlaje, who accompanied the girl to meet Yediyurappa, alleged the perpetrators were forcing the survivor and her family to convert to Islam.

Yediyurappa is learnt to have told the girl to meet Bengaluru police commissioner Bhaskar Rao and register a case. When contacted, Rao said, “I have directed joint commissioner of police (crime), Sandeep Patil, to look into the matter.”

Following the meeting with Yediyurappa, Karandlaje told reporters: “The 18-year-old says she was raped by three, who recorded the criminal acts on camera. She came to me seeking justice. She is one of three children of a Hindu family.

“She has a brother and a sister. The entire family [except the father] is being coerced by these men to convert to Islam. They have threatened to upload the rape video on social media if they didn’t.”

Karandlaje said the girl was raped for over a year in Mangaluru and Bengaluru. She alleged incidents of forced conversion by way of rape were “happening regularly” in border districts of Kerala and Karnataka.

“She, perhaps, is one of many girls who are facing persecution in border areas with Kerala,” Karandlaje said. “We need a thorough investigation into the incident to identify the modus operandi of these criminals.”

Karandlaje said she was told by the Kannur range inspector general (IG) that the perpetrator from Kerala has been arrested.

Meanwhile, in Bengaluru, deputy commissioner of police (DCP, southeast) Isha Pant confirmed a case has been registered in Parapanna Agrahara station limits.

Police said the complaint primarily related to forced conversion to Islam, while a case of rape has been registered in Kerala.

“The survivor and her family were threatened in Bengaluru and asked to convert. She says one of the perpetrators had raped her at a house near Electronics City,” a police officer said.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

TRICHY: As the standing samba paddy crops raised on around 2 lakh acres in Karur and Trichy districts are in the flowering stage, farmers have appealed the state government to enhance the quantum of water release from Mettur reservoir into the Cauvery river and 19 canals including Uyyakondan and Kattalai.

“Farmers from Karur and Trichy district are cultivating samba paddy, banana, flowers, vegetables on around 2.5 lakh acres. As it is in the flowering stage for samba paddy crop, watering should be done on alternative days. However, farmers are struggling to irrigate their paddy crops as there is no flow in the Cauvery as well as 19 tributary canals including Uyyakondan and Kattalai high level canal,” Tamil Manila Congress farmers’ wing state organizer Puliyur A Nagarajan said.

They have taken the issue to the chief minister requesting him to instruct PWD authorities to enhance water release from Mettur reservoir from 1,000 to 5,000 cusecs till the customary closing date of Mettur reservoir on January 28.

“The state has witnessed incessant rain until last week of December. However, sun has started to scorch like summer during the first week of January itself. Moreover, there is no flow in the Cauvery river as the inflow from the Mettur reservoir has decreased drastically,” he said.

P Murugesan, a farmer from Kumara Vayalur, has raised samba paddy on three acres.

“The crop would be ready for harvest during the third week of January. As this is the flowering stage, water is a necessary to bear quality grains. However, at this stage there is no water in the irrigation canals,” he said.

“As per the regular practice, the government should release water in Cauvery till January 28 for irrigation. Moreover, the water level of the reservoir is standing 116.5 feet on January 5. So, the government can very well release water till the customary date,” he added.

When contacted, PWD executive engineer (RC Division) R Baskar told TOI that he has taken steps to enhance the release of water into Uyyakondan and Kattalai canals. “So, there would not be any scarcity for water to the farmers till the harvest,” he added.

PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has set aside the life imprisonment awarded by a trial court to a man who caused his father’s death in 2011, and sentenced him to ten years’ rigorous imprisonment instead.The accused was charged for murdering his father at his home in Aldona, by assaulting him on the head, with a soda bottle and wooden chair.During the hearing of the case, the lawyer of the accused argued that the appellant was suffering from schizophrenia and was not fit to stand trial in the matter. He said that both the deceased and the accused had the blood type O. Therefore, the traces of blood having blood group 'O' being found on the clothes of the appellant was not at all any incriminating circumstance.He also submitted that that in this case, no DNA profiling was undertaken by the prosecution. The lawyer argued that the accused may have assaulted his father due to provocation and so, it was not a case of murder.Public prosecutor S R Rivankar stated that the appellant did not take up the insanity defence in the course of the trial. and submitted that it was a case where the appellant must be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of ten years.The high court rejected the argument that the accused was not fit to stand for trial. The high court held that the evidence on record clearly brings about the circumstances in which the appellant and his deceased father were living in the same house where the incident took place on February 16, 2011.Almost all witnesses, most of them close relatives of both the parties, had deposed to the fights between the appellant and his deceased father, the court said.A division bench comprising justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar observed, “From the nature of injuries brought on record by the prosecution, it does appear that the injuries were caused on account of the appellant hitting the bottle to the face of his deceased father. There is absolutely no evidence that there was any motive or pre-meditation. The material on record suggests that the assault took place in the course of a sudden fight in the heat of passion. Accordingly, the appellant, ought not to have been convicted under Section 302 of IPC but rather, conviction was called for under part (ii) of Section 304.”“The material on record as proved by the prosecution shows that in all human probabilities, the act has been committed by the appellant in the present case. Accordingly, this is a fit case where the appellant deserves to be convicted for the offence of culpable homicide”.While modifying the sentence imposed by trial court, the high court ordered that the appellant shall undergo rigorous imprisonment of ten years, and pay a fine of Rs10,000.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73116158,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-346588,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-sentences-aldona-man-to-10-years-ri-for-killing-father/articleshow/73113255.cms

Thiruvananthapuram/Madurai: A snack shop owner purchased 10 acres of land worth around Rs 40 lakh to construct apartment units for homeless people under Kerala government’s LIFE housing mission at Kadakkal village panchayat, located 50km away from the state capital.

K Abdullah, the 51-year-old shop owner, mustered the money for the land using his chit funds. Land documents will be handed over to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan next week.

Abdullah was in his early teens when he left Puliyankudi near Kadayanallur in Tenkasi district, Tamil Nadu and arrived at Kadakkal in Kollam district in Kerala in search of a job at the age of 8. Abdullah’s parents Karupaiah and Muthammal, who still live in his native place, had named him Subramani. He changed his name to Abdullah after he embraced Islam in 2001.

Through hard work and sheer perseverance over the years, Abdullah rose in life and went on set up a chain of wholesale grocery stores.

It was gram panchayat president R S Biju who suggested to purchase land for LIFE housing mission.

“Abdullah has always been active in charity work, he wanted to do something bigger and I told him about the need for land for the state government’s housing project,” said Biju adding that there are 127 homeless people in the panchayat, of which 87 will get houses in multi-storeyed buildings to be constructed in the plot under LIFE Mission.

LIFE housing mission in the state encountered a dearth of land with officials finding it hard to close a bargain for land deals due to soaring prices.

Abdullah owns a two-storied house and ten cents of land at Kadakkal and spent his childhood making and selling snacks at a small shop.

Later, he bought a push cart and started selling snacks on his own. The business slowly prospered and Abdullah owned around five shops in the town. A few years ago, he transferred four of his shops to his staff at a nominal price.

“It’s not about having money, it’s about how you spend it. If your money could be useful to those who really need it, then your assets become meaningful. I had spent countless nights under a leaking roof in my house. My circumstances did not let me study and I had to start working at a very young age,” said Abdullah who had to drop out of school after Class I.

Abdullah gets all support from his wife Shameena, his son Mohammad and daughter Sabija in his philanthropic activities. In 2001, he sponsored the marriage of a girl who came from humble circumstances.

389,['6/01/2020'],‘HT cotton seeds were stolen during trials’,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Hiwri (Yavatmal): Eight months after farmers’ organization Shetkari Sangathana began its campaign by openly sowing the unapproved and controversial herbicide tolerant (HT) cotton seeds in Akoli Jahangir village of Akola district, it once again made a pitch for making the genetically modified (GM) variety legal.

A small group gathered at Hiwri village in Yavatmal district, infamous for farmers’ suicides on Sunday, where the crop grown out of the HT seeds was showcased. It was a gesture that cotton growers prefer HT over the other seeds. The seeds were sown throughout the region, starting from Akoli Jahangir in June 2019, from where the Shetkari Sangathana, founded by Sharad Joshi, an activist and also former MP, began the agitation. Unlike when it began in June, there was no official of the agriculture department present to take note. After that, 12 persons have been booked for illegal sowing.

At Hiwri, the Sangathana had led a major agitation in December 1994 against the state’s policy barring sale of cotton produce out of Maharashtra, in which three farmers were injured in police firing. This gave the village the name Hiwri Golibar (firing).

The event on Sunday lacked the intensity of 1994. Activists addressed a group of over 100 cotton farmers who had gathered from different parts of Vidarbha. The speakers, including former director of Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) C D Mayee, raised the demand for legalizing HT. CICR is a premier research agency of the central government coming under Indian council for agricultural research (ICAR).

At present, cultivation of HT seeds is an offence punishable with prison term. HT seeds were originally developed by American biotech giant Monsanto, now taken over by Bayer. Calls were also made that the government should approach Bayer to start the process of approval again.

The erstwhile Monsanto had applied before the government’s genetically engineering approval committee (GEAC), seeking an approval to HT seeds in 2011. It later withdrew following a disagreement with the government over licensing fee. Now the ball lies in Bayer’s court to reintroduce the technology by applying again.

Meanwhile, the seeds were pilfered during trials and an entire illegal industry making the seeds has emerged in Gujarat and Telangana.

Mayee said even as the approach by Shetkari Sangathan a was not right, he also supported farmers’ demand on access to latest technology. He said, “the seeds were stolen during the trial and later multiplied. The industries are thriving in Gujarat and Telangana and businessmen have strong political backing. The trials were carried out on the CICR’s premises in Nagpur.”

Now it is up to the government to approach Bayer and offer them better terms so that they once again introduce the technology and farmers will get HTs through the legal channel. As against 40 lakh hectares of cotton farms in Vidarbha, nearly 10 lakh hectares are under HT seeds, he said.

Vijay Niwal on whose land the event was organized said that he has been growing seeds since last six years. “Around six years ago, agents of seed companies from Gujarat had come down to Saikheda, a nearby village where they clandestinely grew the crop in demonstration plots. The farmers were convinced and since then almost every farmer here uses the HT seed, it may be illegal though,” he said. Niwal has 35-acre holding and also runs a cotton ginning mill.

Niwal claims that as against an average expenditure of Rs22000 an acre, going for HT seeds brings it down to Rs16,000. Since the weeds are cleared, the output also increases to at least 10 quintal an acre as against 7 quintals for others.

Vijay Bahalle at whose farm in Akoli Jahangir the seeds were first sown as a part of the agitation, has now been booked for violating the law. “We plan to set up a lab and begin developing the seed on our own,” he told TOI.

Other farmers also admitted to having tried growing HT seeds in part of their fields claiming that it had helped as some also inquired about sources of buying the variety.

Linked to cancer

In February 2017, the state government had constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to probe smuggling of HT seeds. The SIT was directed to finish its job in a month but has not submitted its report even three years down the line.

HT seeds are also being linked to cancer by a section of experts. Cotton plants grown from HT seeds are resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides. This makes weed control easier for the farmer. Doses of glyphosate can be easily sprayed on cotton fields without harming the crop and yet getting rid of the over growth. It leads to major saving on labour costs.

This means HT will also lead to use of glyphosate which is being claimed to be cancerous. Two years ago, Monsanto was charged a heavy fine by a US court when a ground-keeper claimed of having got cancer due to exposure to glyphosate for clearing weeds. There is a group of scientists that opposes the theory too.

Trichy: A district supply and consumer protection officer was insulted by Gandharvakottai AIADMK MLA B Arumugam and his supporters on the stage during a government function in Pudukottai district on Sunday evening.

A video clip of the MLA and AIADMK town secretary Baskar accusing the officer of getting Rs 5 lakh and declaring DMK candidate winner for district panchayat councilor post has gone viral on social media.

The incident took place in Kamarajapuram in Pudukottai on Sunday when health minister was giving away Pongal gift to public. The duo ensured ouster of Akbar Ali from the stage by verbally abusing him.

According to sources, the duo was agitated for Akbar having declared DMK candidate winner for the district panchayat councilor post in ward number three. While counting took place in 14 centres across the district for 13 panchayat unions, Akbar was the election officer for the counting centre for Kundrandarkoil panchayat union, which was held on Thursday and Friday.

DMK candidate Selvam was declared winner for district panchayat councilor post from ward number 3. He had secured 1,780 votes more that the AIADMK candidate Muthu Subramaniam, who had also contested for the post.

“Earlier in the day, counting was over at around 10 pm but supporters of AIADMK MLA from Gandharvakottai B Arumugam had entered the counting centre and asked officials not to announce the results,” said an official source.

While knowing the ruling party members carrying talks with the election officials, members of the DMK staged a protest in front of counting centre seeking to declare the victorious candidate. Following this, Akbar Ali declared Selvam as winner and issued certificate on Friday, January 3.

On Sunday, the MLA objected to the presence of Akbar Ali on the stage by saying that he had brought bad name to the government. When TOI contacted Arumugam for his comments, he refused to comment on the matter. Health minister C Vijaya Baskar, district collector P Uma Maheswari and Akbar Ali were unavailable for comments.

The new initiative will focus on three major areas — protection of environment, blood donation and helping distressed Odias who migrate outside the state for jobs. The chief minister met the leaders associated with the programme at Naveen Nivas on Sunday.

“It is a non-political initiative of the party. The chief minister advised us to serve people by rising above politics. In today’s meeting, he briefed us about the activities to be taken up,” said Arup Patnaik, convener of the programme.

Naveen assigned leaders like Puri MP Pinaki Mishra, Kandhmal MP Achyuta Samanta, senior leader Nalinikanta Pradhan and party worker Sandhya Kumari Nayak the job of handling the environment part of the programme. As part of the environment protection initiative, the party workers would take up massive plantation activities and create awareness on green activities among people.

Leaders Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak , Latika Pradhan, Manohar Randhari, Susanta Kumar Rout and Ananta Jena would look after the blood donation activities.

The Jiban Bindu, voluntary blood donation drive launched in March 2015, would also be part of the new government initiative.

Similarly, leaders like Chandrasekhar Sahu, Sanjib Mallick and Sudhir Samal would take care of the distressed Odias, migrating to other states for jobs.

“The 4.5 crore people of Odisha are my family and I have always been working for their welfare. The new programme will further help serve people in a better way,” Naveen had said while announcing the Odisha — Mo Paribar initiative on October 25 last year.

Thiruvananthapuram: A central government empanelled agency authorised to collect Permanent Retirement Account Number ( PRAN ) details has said documents of more than 3,600 employees of Kerala State Electricity Board Limited had gone missing .

The board had adopted a centralised method for operationalising the National Pension System (NPS). To complete the registration process, hard copies of subscriber registration forms along with KYC documents were to be submitted to the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) e-Governance Infrastructure Ltd, an agency appointed by Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority (PFRDA) which functions as the central record keeping agency (CRA) under NPS .

The state government, vide an order in 2014, had authorised a few facilitation centres in Kerala for the easy submission of subscriber registration forms, one among them being Karvy Data Management Services Ltd.

In accordance with the government direction, 4,311 hard copies of subscriber registration forms along with the KYC documents were forwarded to Karvy Data Management Services in three batches for onward transmission to NSDL-CRA.

However, Karvy said 3,639 applications sent in two batches in transit were missing and requested to provide duplicate copies to complete the registration, an order pertaining to KSEBL decision to charge the agency Rs 3.5 lakh for reprinting the PRAN applications said.

“The details lost have no significant secrecy value. The problem is that we need to reconstruct the service history of the employees whose details have been lost. It’s a laborious process. A team of experts has been deputed to carry out the payment work.” N S Pillai, chairman and managing director of KSEB, said.

The board had initially calculated the cost for reprinting the PRAN applications from KSEBL database as Rs.4.5 lakh. However, following a request from the company, the amount to be paid by the agency was reduced by Rs.1 lakh. The decision in this regard was taken during the board meeting of KSEBL in December.

395,['6/01/2020'],Revised jail manual likely in March,"This story is from January 6, 2020

BHUBANESWAR: The state government is likely to come up with a revised jail manual in March. The existing manual was compiled in 1942 and never updated afterwards.

Work on the proposed new version of the jail manual started in 2016-17 in conformity to ministry of home affairs’ Model Prison Manual. The revised state jail manual is aimed at ensuring smooth management of prisons administration and inmates.

“We hope that the new jail manual will be notified in March. A number of administrative changes, innovations and reforms for prisoners were undertaken over the years. All those changes would be incorporated in the new manual,” newly-posted director general police (prisons and correctional services) Santosh Upadhyay said.

The new manual will have revised classification of prisoners, transfer of inmates to other jails, their diets, health and recreation facilities, power of jail authorities, access to free legal services, provisions for women prisoners and children of inmates, rights of prisoners sentenced to death, modernisation and prison computerisation and inspection of prisons, among others, an official said.

Upadhyay said efforts are being made for expeditious completion of e-prisons system in the state. “We are on the job of database linkage between courts and jails under the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS). It will show details of undertrial prisoners, convicts and their criminal antecedents,” Upadhyay said.

In tune with the government’s 5T model of governance, the prisons DGP said steps are being taken to introduce technological innovation in jails through installation of CCTV cameras in more jails and procurement of mobile phone trackers to prevent use of cellphones in prisons by inmates. “I have asked jail superintendents to maintain utmost transparency in procurement and quality monitoring of food materials. Surprise joints raids will be conducted by police, jail personnel and magistrates,” Upadhyay said.

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) has joined hands with the Nashik-based Nashik Cyclists Foundation (NCF) to promote the public cycle sharing project.

Both NMSCDCL and NCF will encourage citizens to ride bicycle through various programmes. In addition, ‘no-vehicle day,’ will be implemented once a month as part of the promotional activities.

To promote public cycle sharing, a cycle ride is scheduled to be taken on January 26 on select routes in the city. The initiative will encourage people to use bicycles as much as possible.

The promotion of the public cycle sharing project will be done on the theme of sports, health and environment.

The initiatives by NMSCDCL come after the private company looking after the rent-a-cycle project in the city decided to withdraw as it has become financially unviable. The company had also given exit notice to the NMSCDCL.

According to official sources, the company had invested about Rs 3.5 crore to introduce the scheme last year. While the operating cost of the scheme is Rs 3.5 lakh per month, the company is only able to collect up to Rs 1 lakh. They are incurring losses over Rs 2 lakh per month due to poor response from to the project.

After the notice, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had told the company that it cannot withdraw from the project. Moreover, the NMC had also sent a default notice to the company to whicb they have not yet received a response. The issue is to be discussed during the upcoming meeting of directorial board of the smart city.

Meanwhile, the NMSCDCL has undertaken initiatives to encourage the project. They recently conducted a meeting with the office-bearers of the NCF.

During the meeting, both NMSCDCL and NCF officials determined to make the city cycle capital of the country.

398,['6/01/2020'],"History-sheeters keep record, ‘no good behaviour’ say cops","This story is from January 6, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Not a single history-sheeter ’s name has been removed from the dossier of history-sheeters in Vizag city in the past decade. Though the police said that they would pursue the closure of history-sheeters’ cases based on their good behaviour, nothing has happened so far.

The involvement of some history-sheeters—including Rajana Kanna Babu of Vizag—in recently hatching a plot to murder the YSRC leader M Chiranjeevi of Srikakulam district has exposed that some history-sheeters are still active in spite of counselling from the police.

Police said that there were over 380 history-sheeters in Vizag city and added the majority of the history-sheeters live under Arilova, Gajuwaka, Kancharapalem and One Town police station limits in the city.

“We have listed out the active history-sheeters (which are over 80 in number) in the city and have been counselling on every Sunday and warning them of stringent action if they indulge in any illegal activity, such as settlements, land grabbing, breach of peace and public tranquillity,” said assistant commissioner of police (Task Force) A Trinad Rao. “The illegal activities of the history-sheeters in the city has declined and we are chalking out plans to further reduce their activities,” he added.

The removal of names from the dossier of history-sheeters is a cumbersome procedure. The police would delete the names if the history-sheeters haven’t been involved in any illegal activity for a few years and shown good behaviour. “We haven’t considered removing the name of any history-sheeters from the dossier, instead, we have suggested history-sheeters to apply for the removal of their names, keeping their age in mind,” said Trinad Rao.

Police said that they hadn’t noticed any history-sheeters display good behaviour enough for them to recommend their name for removal from the dossier. Some history-sheeters have been involved in extortion from traders, running illegal gambling dens and some have been posing as friends of political leaders.

“Our top priority is to safeguard Vizag’s image, which has been known as a city of peace and tranquillity. We have been keeping a vigil on some active history-sheeters in the city to prevent illegal activities. We recently nabbed a gang, who were trying to eliminate a YSRC leader, with key inputs,” said city police chief RK Meena.

A few years ago there were two major gangs headed by history-sheeters in the city. One gang was led by Telugu Anil Kumar and Kasim while the another gang was led by B Murali, Chittimamu, Podugu Kiran and Latchu. Due to this gang rivalry, Latchu and Anil were eliminated by the rival gangs and Podugu Kiran committed suicide in the central prison. Kasim was murdered by his rival gang. We are taking all the steps to prevent possible gang rivalry incidents,” said a senior police officer.

Hyderabad: The Telangana government’s free parking GO is facing legal hurdles as it applies only to Greater Hyderabad and urban areas. Taking advantage of the GO, theatres moved the Telangana high court and obtained stay orders in Nalgonda and Sircilla districts.

The municipal administration and urban development department had issued a GO (MS No. 63) on March 20, 2018, rationlising and regulating parking fee at commercial establishments/malls/multiplexes in Hyderabad and other urban areas of Telangana. The GO was issued in compliance with the then AP high court order of 2003.

Forum Against Corruption president and activist Vijay Gopal said, “The GO was rushed and it is flawed. There is no clarity on the term ‘Urban’. There are no penal provisions in it. It is limited only to cities and urban areas, where corporations, municipalities and nagar panchayats exist.”

“The high court, in the order, said commercial establishments, which are required to provide parking space as a pre-condition for construction permission (property owners have to leave 44% space for parking), cannot turn around and collect money from visitors. The HC, in Ch Madan Mohan versus Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad, had said parking must be free in all commercial establishments,” he added.

Theatres in Nalgonda and Sircilla challenged the GO in court and secured stay in 2019. Activists are now demanding the state government amend the GO to avoid exploitation.

“The GO should say free parking policy for all commercial establishments of Telangana instead of using the word urban and address the issue permanently. They should also add penal provisions as per the GHMC Act,” the activists added.

Amaravati: GN Rao, convener of the experts committee on capital city, dismissed allegations by TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu that the committee had readied the report based on the advice of Ajeya Kallam, advisor to chief minister.

In a statement on Sunday, Rao said none of the committee members discussed anything with government officials during the preparation of the report. He said the committee members were experts in their fields.

He said that demeaning the experience of the committee members was not correct. “Professor K T Ravindran is a globally acclaimed architect and was vice-chairman of environmental impact assessment committee at the national level for the past five years. Ravindran has been nominated as member of the advisory board of United Nations. Mahavir is a reputed urban planner and heading the committees on GIS based Amrut cities. Anjali Karol Mohan has two decades of experience as urban planner and associated with IIT, Bangalore. How could anyone expect that such people will write whatever the government wants on the subjects on which they are an authority?” asked GN Rao.

He said KB Arunachalam, another member of the committee worked as chief planner in Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority for nearly three decades under different governments and played a key role in designing infrastructure projects in the city.

Similarly, AV Subbarao is a professor of environment at JNTU and responsible for preparing wetland atlas for AP government. As retired IAS officers Vijayamohan and he himself have served the state government in different capacities with impeachable integrity, said GN Rao. He said while Vijayamohan was the man behind the launch of mee-seva centres, he executed Silparamam project of Hyderabad.

Rao said the committee held meetings in districts with officials and public representatives before interacting with top state government officials. He said they also sought people’s feedback on issues related to development via mail. “We examined reports of Sivaramakrishnan committee before writing the final report,” said Rao.

He said the committee had maintained confidentiality in the preparation of the report till it was submitted to the government. “None of us has interacted with any official after the meetings and not shared the content with any official during the preparation of the report,” said Rao.

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Sunday floated a tender for hiring a private agency to survey unauthorised mobile towers in the city.

Various private mobile phone operators have erected mobile towers across the city. Some of them do not adhere to the rules and regulations laid down by the Development Control & Promotion Regulation (DCPR) of the NMC.

“Earlier in September, we had floated a tender to rope in a private agency for conducting a survey of mobile towers, but we received poor response. After the directive of the municipal commissioner last week, we have now against floated the tender for the second time,” an NMC official said.

“We have already removed some illegal mobile towers in the last few months. However, there are still some mobile towers that have not obtained permissions from the civic body. As a result, NMC lost its revenue through permission fees and property tax,” said NMC sources.

The agency will survey unauthorised mobile towers in the city and will also collect fees or other charges from these mobile towers on behalf of the municipal corporation.

Besides, the agency will be accountable for collecting property tax from these mobile tower companies.

Malappuram: A traffic awareness animation video which was created by Malappuram police has evoked warm response in social media platforms.

The video, which was released through the official Facebook page of Kerala Police on Friday morning, got around over 3 lakh views by Sunday evening, and police authorities said that the total viewers of the video through different social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, etc is more than 1.6 million.

The video titled ‘Narmathiloode Marmathilekk’ was scripted and directed by Philip Mambad, assistant sub-inspector of traffic enforcement, Malappuram, and Hari Narayanan, senior civil police officer of Edavanna police station. District police chief U Abdul Kareem was the creative adviser of the video.

The focus of the video, shared by district collectors, celebrities and political leaders, is the need to follow traffic rules, especially wearing helmets and seat belts. A voice-over in local Malappuram slang by Panali Junais is a major attraction of the around 5-minute long video.

The video details the present traffic situation in the state through animated videos and pictures. The video mocks those who ride motor bikes without following traffic rules in a satirical manner.

Mambad said that the video was produced at Kareem’s behest at a cost of Rs 2,000, and it has been widely shared by Malayalis across the world. “We are expecting a major impact with the video. We are hopeful that the local slang of the voice-over will make a wave,” he said.

Besides awareness on wearing helmets and seat belts, the video also tells about the need of insurance protection for vehicles and rules regarding transfer of ownership certificates of the vehicles.

Kareem said that the idea for the video was first introduced when the district police office decided to organize a traffic awareness class.

“The presentation of facts in a satirical way has made the video a hit on social media. It has a very positive impact among youngsters who are reluctant to follow traffic rules,” he said.

The civic body had identified these new properties during a survey conducted around a year ago

NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to bring as many as 59,000 new properties under the tax ambit from financial year 2020-21.

The civic body had identified these new properties during a survey conducted around a year ago. The NMC has already conducted hearing on objections by 10,000 properties, while hearing on the remaining properties will begin from next week.

Addition of these new properties is expected to increase the civic body’s revenue through property tax by around Rs 30 crore. The NMC had conducted a survey of new properties through a New Delhi-based private agency and had found a total of 4.88 lakh properties in the year 2018. The survey revealed the presence of around 59,000 new structures across the six divisions.

The civic later sent notices to owners of these new properties, asking them to pay the property tax. However, around 25,000 people took objections and filed written complaints with the civic body alleging that they were served inflated and faulty bills, while others complained that they bought the house in 2016, but got the property tax bills since 2012.

The issue was discussed for long during the general body meeting held in December 2018. Some corporators even claimed that the private agency had conducted the survey with the help of city students.

Following this, city mayor directed the civic administration to cancel all the notices of property tax sent to owners of new properties and conduct a new survey.

Accordingly, municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game had announced that property tax collection from these new properties would be started only after a hearing and proper verification is done. Of the 59,000 new properties, 21,000 properties have completion certificates and there were no issues with such properties.

“We have plans to bring these new properties under property tax net from the next financial year,” an NMC official said.

The NMC collected Rs 112 crore through property tax in the last financial year and is eyeing revenue of Rs 218 crore in the current fiscal. So far, the civic body has collected Rs 109 crore as property tax.

Kakinada: A home guard died after he was allegedly pushed out of a running train by a man suspected to be mentally deranged, near Tuni in East Godavari district on Sunday.

The incident took place in Bokaro Express and the Home Guard, identified as R Surya Venkata Siva, was proceeding to Visakhapatnam when some passengers sought his intervention over a tussle on seat sharing.

Siva, who was attached to Kotananduru police station, went to Samalkota on official work. He was returning to Visakhapatnam when the incident took place.

According to passengers, a man from Bihar created ruckus in the compartment over sharing of seat. A few passengers approached the home guard for help. The man entered into a heated argument with Siva and allegedly pushed him out of the running train. Siva died on the spot.

When contacted, East Godavari SP Adnan Nayeem Asmi said the police had received information that Siva fell down from the compartment while trying to protect some passengers from the maniac. He said the police are investigating if the home guard’s death was accidental or he was thrown out of the train by someone.

However, government railway police (GRP) circle inspector, Kakinada division, K Madhusudan Reddy told TOI that Siva accidentally slipped out of the running train when it was nearing Tuni railway station . Asked if Siva fell down during a scuffle, he said the Home Guard was in a separate compartment while trouble broke out in another compartment.

Reddy said the police registered a case of death under suspicious circumstances.

Vehicles navigate barricades placed to slow down vehicle movement on busy roads and junctions, in Visakhapatna... Read More

Visakhapatnam: Although there are traffic signals installed at important crossings on NH-16, the city’s residents are now demanding that such signals be installed at the busiest crossings within the main city areas.

Residents claim that traffic inside the city has increased so much in the past few years that it has become very difficult for pedestrians to cross the road in some areas.

“A few crossings in MVP Colony and Siripuram localities are a nightmare for pedestrians. During peak hours, and sometimes even in the evening on weekends, it takes at least 10 to 15 minutes to cross a road that is barely 12-feet wide,” said K Arun Kumar, a resident.

Residents claim that such signals are the need of the hour, especially at crossings which have schools and hospitals in the vicinity. They say that students, guardians, patients and their relatives are putting their lives at risk while crossing these roads.

“With no signals at road crossings, motorists don’t stop their vehicles and often don’t even slow down their vehicles. Close shaves are quite regular. Imagine, we have to cross these roads regularly by braving such traffic with young kids,” said P Sukanaya, whose nine-year-old daughter studies at a reputed school in the city.

Vizagites claim that even if cops man these crossings, they mostly don’t bother to stop vehicles manually by raising their hands to give way for the pedestrians. The cops simply stand at the crossing to stop bikers without helmets and register cases against errant motorists.

“It seems police in Visakhapatnam don’t have proper traffic management training. They don’t know that stopping moving vehicles at important crossings (where there is no signal ) to give a safe passage to pedestrians is a part of their duty. If Visakhapatnam becomes the capital, then the number of vehicles will increase considerably and such a traffic management system will not suffice,” said Sohan Hatangadi, a resident who has been living in the beach city for decades.

Officials of the traffic department claimed that they had taken up the issues with the civic office, the state government, and even with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) several times in the past. There have been proposals for a pedestrian underpass or a foot-over-bridge at a few crossings on the highways, and for traffic signals at a few crossings within the main city, but none of these proposals have gotten the final nod, a senior traffic official said.

“Looking at the way traffic is increasing in the beach city, it is important to increase the number of crossings with traffic signals. We have selected a few important crossings to install the signals and it is expected that soon the budget would be sanctioned. Till then, we are placing barricades to slow down vehicles movement at these crossings,” the traffic official added.

407,['6/01/2020'],Young doctors to get global professional training in Nagpur,"This story is from January 6, 2020

President Dr Ramesh Mehta addressing the inaugural function of GAPIO summit 2020

Nagpur: Fresh MBBS graduates in Central India will soon have an option to get themselves trained under ‘2+2 training module’ instituted by the Global Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (GAPIO) in Nagpur.

This unique education module serves MBBS graduates with an opportunity to get trained by international faculties for first two years followed by on-job training in UK/USA for next two years. On Saturday, GAPIO and Kingsway Hospital in Nagpur entered a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in this regard.

“India produces more than 70,000 doctors annually. Less than half of these students get admission to Post Graduation (PG) courses. Moreover, medical students in India receive excellent clinical training but they lack soft skills like communication, leadership and management. Also, some students do not get exposure to cutting edge clinical developments. GAPIO’s mission is to end this crisis and to empower our doctors with highest professional standards,” said Dr Ramesh Mehta, chairman of GAPIO. Center at Kingsway Hospital will be the first and only in Central India.

Earlier, similar centres have been established in Pune and New Delhi. Doctors who join this course will be trained for MRCP (UK) examination of skills, knowledge and behaviour of doctors which is must for working in UK. “The activity will stop brain drain and start brain gain for India. After training in UK for two years, these doctors will come back and work in India,” he said.

Dr Rajkumar Khandelwal of Kingsway hospital claimed that Nagpur centre will get highest response. “Nagpur is emerging as medical education and health service hub of India. Even the GAPIO conference that is under way in city has received highest 3,000 registrations and 120 scientific papers this year. This is the indicator of Nagpur being a preferable centre medical fraternity from all states of India,” he said.

Dr Anupam Sibal, president-elect of GAPIO said that the strength of Indian doctors working abroad will be used effectively to groom Indian doctors. “Indian doctors occupy highest positions in majority of global hospitals. There are 31 million of Indians settled abroad with 1.2 million physicians and doctors of Indian origin. They are keen to work for the local students,” he claimed.

The MoU signing also marked the inauguration of tenth GAPIO international conference which is being held for the first time in any non-metro of India. More than 3,000 delegates from different countries are in Nagpur for this conference. Veteran physician of Nagpur Dr B J Subhedar inaugurated this three-day summit. Padmashri Dr Prakash Amtey was guest of honour. They praised the education initiatives taken by doctors of Indian origin settled abroad.

MANGALURU: The basement in the head office of Mangalore Electricity Supply Company at Bejai here comes alive with children’s activities during working days. This thanks to an employee centric move that Snehal Rayamane , managing director of the company, has taken to start a day care centre for children of the company’s women employees working in the head office. The centre was inaugurated in November.

Managed by Blue Umbrella , the day care centre provides a place for lactating women to take care of their young ones and leave the slightly older ones in the care of experts qualified to handle youngsters. The centre is also a hub for learning for children and gives them scope to brush up on studies picked up in their pre-school or day school. With toys to play around, the centre offers lots of opportunities for young ones to spend their time productively.

Snehal, who has a three-year-old says the main reason for starting this centre is to help women employees strike better work to home balance. “As the MD, I have the leeway to go home, attend to my son when needed and come back,” Snehal told TOI. For most working women, it is a difficult choice to make – either to take care of their children or focus on their work – and this day care centre makes their work a lot easier, Snehal averred.

For women employees at Mescom Bhavan , the centre is god send as they know their children are safe, while they go about their work. Managed by Asha Shetty of Blue Umbrella, the centre sees more children come in the post-lunch session, Snehal observed. Incidentally, the office of deputy commissioner in Udupi too has a similar day care centre and such initiatives are needed, Snehal adds.

Secunderabad: With the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) elections round the corner, members of civilian wards in SCB have been taking up various pending developmental works in their respective wards.

Civic works such as construction of community halls, laying of roads, provision of water supply and,repair and upgrade of sewerage have been proposed by ward members. They have also requested that pending proposals be cleared and adequate funds be allocated from the MLAs’ constituency development programme (CDP) and from the Cantonment Board fund.

The pace of work in the Cantonment area appears to have gained momentum following the reservation process in the eight Cantonment wards.

For instance, on Sunday, J Maheswara Reddy, member of ward 1, laid foundation stones for three community halls and a graveyard located in his ward. He also obtained clearance from the Office of District Collectorate to avail the CDP fund.

“The election code of conduct comes into force once the election notification is issued by the Ministry of Defence. I have laid foundation stones for proposed infrastructure work amounting to nearly Rs 80 lakh. A total of 12 community halls have been proposed and of them, seven community halls have been complete and are ready for inauguration,” J Maheshwara Reddy told TOI.

Ward 1 has been announced as General Category ward and Maheshwara Reddy is keen to contest again from the same ward in the upcoming polls. “I have confident that TRS party will give me a chance to contest again,” Reddy said.

Meanwhile, Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) has provided an administrative sanction of Rs 2.5 crore for the beautification of Ramannakunta lake in ward 6. However, work is yet to begin.

Sources said that various proposals involving laying of water and sewerage lines, new infrastructure and roads are pending with the SCB due to financial crunch. “It is a long wait to get any sort of clearance from SCB. Various developmental works have been halted due to financial problem,” according a ward member.

Metro rail patronage may have touched around 1 lakh daily, but the swanky underground stations built as per international standards do not have functioning air conditioning systems

CHENNAI: Metro rail patronage may have touched around 1 lakh daily, but the swanky underground stations built as per international standards do not have functioning air conditioning systems. Instead, noisy wall-mounted fans are installed at platforms with the air conditioning switched off to save water and money.Commuters complain that the stations are stuffy. Many are forced to huddle under the four fans. Since the huge stations have two levels - a concourse to buy tickets and a platform to board trains - people have to spend at least 10 minutes before boarding a train. The stations have been built in such a way that there should be centralised air conditioning throughout the day. But metro authorities switch off air conditioning during non-peak hours, probably when it is needed the most because the weather is hot.Gladys Jayakumar, a frequent commuter from Anna Nagar to LIC, said it took five minutes to walk down long passageways to reach the concourse. “It is suffocating to be in a station. They have not switched on the air conditioning. Fans are not placed at convenient points.”Metro rail had cited water crisis in summer to switch off the air conditioning. The water situation has eased but the water-guzzling AC systems continue to be in sleep mode in the concourse of all underground stations and switched off in the platform levels of smaller stations.Metro rail began switching off air conditioning at stations during May last year when the city was reeling under acute water crisis. Authorities said metro rail would save up to 30% of water by switching off the AC units during non-peak hours. But nine months down the line, the situation has not changed, even after a good monsoon.For metro rail, it seems to be a matter of economics. A metro rail official said the AC units are designed for heavier station load or footfall and hence they switch them off in stations where there is thin crowd in the afternoons. The official said metro rail has been operating air-conditioning in the platforms levels of busy stations such as Central and Thirumangalam for 18 hours a day, while the units are switched off in LIC, Nandanam , Saidapet and a few others. AC units are turned off in the concourse levels of all underground stations as officials said ticketing levels only see moving crowd while crowd gathering is on the platform.“The AC units in the stations are designed for a load of 300 to 400 passengers at a time. But some stations barely have 1,000 passengers a day and the platforms are empty in the afternoons when we switch off the AC units for a couple of hours. It’s turned on by 3pm for the cool air to spread before the peak hours,” an official said. “But the blowers and ventilation systems are kept on throughout the operational hours for air circulation,” he added.Sources said that this could be because of a mismatch in planning the facilities and the constraints of operating them. “When the stations were planned, it was done as per a common template followed by metro systems world over. They did not think that the stations and their air conditioning are being made for a city which faces water scarcity . Patronage has not increased as expected when the facility was planned more than 10 years ago. This is the reason metro is struggling to cut corners to balance operations and loss,” said an official.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73114521,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-253758,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/acs-off-at-stations-commuters-break-sweat-on-metro-rail-travel/articleshow/73113996.cms

Koraput: Much to the delight of students and authorities concerned, the tribal folk dance performed by students of Bhakurguda ashram of Rayagada district has found a place of pride in a music video titled ‘Wake Up’. It has been prepared by Unicef for children to mark the world body’s 70th anniversary in the country.

Bhakurguda ashram is a residential school meant for students belonging to the scheduled caste (SC) and schedule dtribe (ST) category.

“It is a proud moment for both students and staff as the performance of our children is a part of the Unicef’s music video focussing on providing a better world for children as they are the future of the country,” said Gagan Chandra Sahu, headmaster of the school.

The 3.19-minute video with the song — a mix of Hindi and English lyrics — is prepared by Grammy winner Rickey Kej and was launched on January 1. The music video showcases the performances by children from across the country.

“Through a crowd-sourcing activity, the Unicef had collected videos on children’s performance from across the country and at least 40 entries were accessed by the composer to create the song with the lyrics,” said Dwiti Chandra Sahu, senior teacher of the school.

Apart from stressing on child rights and empowering children, the video showcases the Unicef’s contribution to the white revolution and immunisation since its journey started in the country in 1949.

Situated at a distance of 7 km from the district headquarters town of Rayagada, the school with 372 students, including 140 girls, have classes from I to VIII. It is being run by the state’s ST and SC development department.

414,['6/01/2020'],PM Narendra Modi invokes Swamiji to hail West Bengal’s intellect,"This story is from January 6, 2020

The revamped Old Currency Building

KOLKATA: Prime Minister Narendra on Saturday evening said that intellectual and spiritual leadership of Bengal will be crucial in turning Vivekananda ’s prediction — that 21st Century will be India’s — into reality. The PM was referring to Vivekananda’s speech at the Parliament of the World’s Religions in Chicago on September 11, 1893. Modi was attending a function at the Currency Building in Kolkata’s Dalhousie Square.

Dedicating the restored Old Currency Building, Belvedere House, galleries of Victoria Memorial Hall, and Metcalfe Hall as new cultural spaces, Modi the Centre had decided to transform five iconic museums in the country into international standard, beginning with Indian Museum, Kolkata, one of the oldest in the world.

He also said the government was keen to convert Belvedere House into a world-class museum and the old mint on Strand Bank Road into a museum of currency and coins.

Addressing the gathering, Modi said Bengal had given birth to many of India’s bravest sons who had tirelessly fought for the country’s freedom. “Subhas Chandra Bose is the brightest, but there are so many — such as Aurobindo Ghose, Rash Bihari Bose, Khudiram Bose, Deshbandhu, Bagha Jatin and Binoy, Badal, Dinesh — who should have their pride of place at the new gallery at Victoria Memorial Hall called ‘Biplobi Bharat’.

India, Modi said, did not conquer any land with force and weapons, but has won the world’s heart with its profound philosophy, music, culture and spiritual guidance over the centuries. Bengal led in all these spheres with its creative spirit, he said. “This is why I think it is time to look at India’s history again,” Modi said.

Quoting Rabindranath Tagore, he said, “India’s history is not about invasions. How the people faced those tempests is absent in history. History is not tales of royalty. Those untold stories must rea’ch our future generations.” “India’s real strength is its culture, heritage and wisdom from the days gone by. Bengal’s greatest sons — from Ram Mohan Roy to Satyajit Ray — carried those values through their works. We must take them forward to the new India we dream of. We are celebrating the 200th birth anniversary of Vidyasagar this year and will 250th birth anniversary of Raja Rammohan Roy in 2022.

Palakkad: After the long wait of five years, the construction of the demolished KSRTC Palakkad bus stand will start on January 14, 2020.

An agreement was signed for the construction between the district panchayat executive engineer K C Subramaniyan and the contracting company Oralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society Limited chairman P Rameshan.

As per the agreement the construction must be completed within 15 months. In the first stage, construction of entrance plaza will be completed and the bus yard will be constructed in the second stage.

An amount of Rs 5 crore was sanctioned from the local area asset development fund of Palakkad MLA Shafi Parambil.

Another amount of Rs 2.1 crore will be allotted from the MLAs fund for the second stage construction of bus yard.

Palakkad KSRTC depot not only operates buses to different parts of the district and the state but also inter-state buses to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The reconstruction of the bus stand was inaugurated in 2016.

But there was delay in the preparations of plan by the engineers of the local self-government department.

The KSRTC bus stand construction was given administrative sanction by the state government and the KSRTC had also prepared a master plan.

But the engineering wing of KSRTC directed to revise the plan submitted by the contracting company.

After certain changes the KSRTC engineering wing submitted the new plan to the engineering wing of the LSG.

But the chief engineer of KSRTC engineering wing returned the plan submitted by the LSG engineering wing suggesting some more changes resulting in the undue delay now.

Thus, the construction of the new bus stand was delayed by five years.

But before getting all these sanctions the old KSRTC bus stand was demolished and no temporary alterative facilities were made.

This has put the commuters through great hardship as there is no waiting shed or other amenities in the bus stand.

The lack of parking facility for the buses including the inter-state buses is a major problem.

During the heavy rain the problem becomes acute due to waterlogging of the demolished stand.

AMRITSAR: Pakistan government's claims on not allowing anti-India elements to operate from its soil were exposed on Sunday when Pakistan's pro-Khalistan face, Gopal Singh Chawla, was given free access to meet Indian pilgrims at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartapur Sahib complex on Sunday during the celebrations organised by Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) to mark the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.

According to sources, Pakistan's Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), which - as per intelligence sources - is under the direct command of ISI, allowed Chawla to lead the functions, address the gathering and meet Indian pilgrims.

""Chawla has close ties with terror mastermind Hafiz Saeed and many other militants for his anti-India rantings, so he is indispensable for ISI that uses him as an anti-India Sikh face of Pakistan, and he has been accordingly awarded with various benefits,"" a source said.

India had strongly objected to Chawla's inclusion in the 10-member PSGPC announced on March 27, 2019, by Pakistan's former federal minister for information and broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain.

However, buckling under Indian pressure Pakistan government dissolved the committee and removed Chawla from PSGPC, but later ""promoted"" him by including him as a non-official member of ETPB on April 19, prompting India to give a verbal demarche to Pakistan through diplomatic channels. This led to Pakistan government issuing a statement that the membership of Chawla had been de-notified.

According to sources, Chawla delivered a venomous speech against India during the function.

Chawla was also present at Gurdwara Nankana Sahib on Saturday during the visit of Islamic scholars and religious leaders, aimed at restoring the confidence among Pakistan Sikhs following the frenzied protest and stoning of the gurdwara.

Meanwhile, ETPB spokesperson Amir Hashmi said a religious procession was taken out in the Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara complex, which was attended by Indian pilgrims.

417,['6/01/2020'],Tamil Nadu: No proper signage to locate stations,"This story is from January 6, 2020

A signboard points towards Vadapalani station

CHENNAI: It has been six months since the entire two-corridor 45km metro network started functioning, but CMRL is yet to install signage to guide commuters to stations. Except for the elevated viaducts that could indicate a first time commuter that there is a metro station somewhere close by, commuters struggle to locate underground stations on Anna Salai, Poonmallee High Road and parts of Anna Nagar .

Due to space constraint, entry/exits of underground stations were built at locations that are difficult for people to spot. For instance, Central Metro, which has five access points, lacks signage around the station or inside Chennai Central Railway Station to guide first-time users to the facility.

Metro rail networks world over have maypole-like installations 500m around a station to guide people about the distance and direction to the stations. The idea is to tell people that there is a metro station at walking distance. But, CMRL is yet to install signage in the city.

A case in point is the St Thomas Mount station, one of the biggest in the city, which has no signage leading to its east entrance that is almost a kilometre from MKN Road. The access road has on its sides rotting garbage.

Following commuter complaints, CMRL installed a few signboards between Vadapalani and Arumbakkam stations on the 100 Feet Road and one near DMS station on Anna Salai on trial basis. But these boards do not say how far the stations are.

418,['6/01/2020'],Proposal for semi-high speed corridor from Secunderabad to Nagpur gathers steam,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Repersentational Image

SECUNDERABAD: Implementation of semi-high speed rail services in the Secunderabad-Nagpur corridor has gained momentum after South Central Railway (SCR) sent a detailed project report (DPR) to the railway board for detailed review and further approval.

In the report, SCR has suggested that the structural renewal of the 577-km long Secunderabad–Nagpur corridor, which would be done in three phases, will help increase speed of trains.

According to SCR officials, presently the travel time is around nine hours and by upgrading the section to a semi-high speed corridor, trains that run at 120 kmph can run at 200 kmph, reducing travel time to five hours.

The railway board has sent the DPR to Research Designs and Standardisation Organisation (RDSO), Lucknow. Based on the recommendations received from RDSO, further decisions will be made regarding the implementation of the project.

“With the increased speed and reduced running time, we will get a chance to introduce and operate more trains along the stretch,” an SCR official told TOI.

“A proportionate increase in the speed of train will help in running a higher number of freight trains, as the section between Kazipet – Balharshah is a hub for freight traffic. The line is surrounded by coal mines, cement factories and NTPC,"" he added. Preliminary discussions were held in 2016 on feasibility and implementation of the project.

“We have carried out technical and execution study for upgrading the speed of passenger trains on the proposed semi-high speed rail corridor. A detailed analysis was carried out at the Secunderabad–Ballarshah section to understand the technicalities of the section in terms of its engineering, geography, traffic forecast, and existing infrastructure,” the public relations officer of SCR said.

Meanwhile, owing to a rise in occupancy from 76% to 110% of the tri-weekly Nagpur-Secunderabad-Nagpur Express in the past six years, Indian Railways has also decided to extend the train up to Raipur. The train will now be known as Raipur-Secunderabad Superfast Express.

419,['6/01/2020'],Mayor all ears for your grievances every Saturday,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Nashik: Taking cue from his predecessors and with an aim to know and solve the grievances of the citizens from close quarters, mayor Satish Kulkarni has announced the ‘ visit to ward ’ project that will commence from Saturday.

The mayor will visit one ward in each of the six divisions of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) every Saturday and interact with the residents living in a particular ward to know their grievances. All major issues plaguing residents like water supply, garbage collection, roads, drainage, etc will be addressed during the mayor’s visit and sorted out as much as possible. Officials from the civic administration will also accompany the mayor during his weekly visit to the wards.

Former mayor Ranjana Bhansi had started the project initially, but it faltered in a matter of months. Former municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe had also approached citizens in select areas of the city to know their grievances.

“There has been a rise in the number of dengue positive cases in the city in the last few months. Efforts are being taken to curb the outbreak of such diseases. Hence, cleanliness is at the top of my priority list and I will be focussing on this aspect during my ward visit,” said Kulkarni.

“Initiatives are also being taken to make the city free from black spots,” said the mayor. During a recent meeting of the civic adminsitration, Kulkarni had issued instructions to concerned officials to take stock of the black spots in the city and remove them on priority basis.

“Although there is a manpower crunch, keeping the city clean is NMC’s priority. Sanitary officials from respective divisions should identify the black spots and take measures to clear such spots,” said Kulkarni. He also warned that stern action would be taken against those officials found guilty of dereliction of duty.

During his term as the deputy mayor between 2012 and 2014, Kulkarni had deployed a Mumbai-based NGO to maintain cleanliness in the city and fine those found littering on the open. The initiative had received an overwhelming response from citizens.

Nagpur: Three coveted artistes — Bharatanatyam dancer Arupa Lahiri, classical vocalists Sukirti Uikey and Mahesh Kale — kicked off the most awaited 3-day Kalidas Mahotsav on a resounding note at Bhat Hall in Reshimbagh on Sunday evening, offering a rich experience to the music and classical dance lovers of city.

Popular vocalist Mahesh Kale began with a tarana in raag ‘Malkaunsa’. Later he sang ‘Shabdawachun kalale shabdanchya palikadale’ written by Mangesh Padgaonkar. He presented another song ‘Guru ek jagi dnyata’ composed by Sudhir Fadke and a bhajan ‘Muralidhar shayam’. His last presentation ‘Kaivalyavyachya chandanyala bhukela chakor’ floored one an all.

Earlier, the programme began with classical vocalist Sukirti Uikey mesmerizing the audience with her melodious voice. She chose classic ragas which perfectly went along with the theme of the festival. She began with Ganesh Vandana and chose a bandish ‘Payalia jhankar’ from raag Puryaadhanashree and later performed a tarana in the same raag. She then presented a very popular thumri ‘Yaad piya ki aai’ in raag Mand. She was accompanied by her father Ramesh Uike on tabla, Shrikant Pise on harmonium and Sharvari Naik on tanpura.

The second event was an enchanting Bharatanatyam performance by Arupa Lahiri. She began her performance by presenting ‘anjali’. Her performance embraced the femininity of apsara Urvashi dancing at the court of Indradev. She later showcased precise mudras on a poem by Kavi Dinkar. It was followed by a ‘navras’ depiction from Kalidas’s play ‘Vikramorvasiyam’ which incidentally is the theme of the mahotsav.

She ended the performance with a composition of Aadi Shankaracharya ‘Ardhanarishwara Ashtakam’ in raag Megh. She was accompanied by Shankar Narayan Swami on mridangam, Devika Rajraman on natwangam, Vasudha Balakrishna (vocal) and Raghunandan Ramakrishna on flute.

421,['6/01/2020'],No info on Muslim minorities being persecuted: RK Singh,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Union minister of power and energy, R K Singh, on Sunday said the Citizenship Amendment Act was all about providing people with citizenship and not taking it away. During a meet with the media, at the BJP party office in the city, the Union minister blamed a few political parties for claiming that CAA would threaten the rights of citizens.

“The CAA is all about providing citizenship to those people who have been persecuted on religious grounds in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. These are Islamic states, where religious minorities have been persecuted and we are trying to empower these people, not just by providing shelter but also citizenship,” the minister said. He added that it was the responsibility of the government of India to provide citizenship to all the people persecuted on religious grounds as all those from modern day Pakistan and Bangladesh, were once citizens of undivided India, pre-Partition.

Regarding the right of the Centre to amend the Citizenship Act, the minister stated, “The subject is on the Union list; it is the constitutional right of the Union government to provide citizenship.”

On being asked about the stand taken by some of the non-BJP governments such in Kerala and West Bengal, the minister said, “ They cannot take such a stand as it would be unconstitutional. The states cannot act unilaterally. This would tantamount to challenging the Constitution of India.”

When asked if persecuted Muslim minorities were also included in the list of the minorities persecuted on religious grounds, the minister observed that they have no information regarding Muslim minorities being persecuted.

After the press meet, he released pamphlets on CAA, stating that they would be distributed to the public across the country starting from Sunday and announced the toll-free number- 88662-88662, to which people can give missed call to vote for CAA.

Visakhapatnam: Ex-BJP floor leader and former MLA from Vizag-North, Penmetsa Vishnu Kumar Raju, on Sunday, came out in support of the proposal to set up the executive capital in Visakhapatnam. He, however, quickly pointed out that it was his personal opinion. Talking to the media here, Raju said that Visakhapatnam was ideal for the executive capital and added that the previous regime had merely built castles in the air.

“There is nothing in Amaravati. Moreover, the cost of building a world-class capital there is astounding. The previous regime sold the local farmers a dream that would not take shape. In comparison, there is enough government land available in Visakhapatnam and the cost of construction is less than half. All that we require is Rs 1,000 crore for a total built-up space of two million square feet to establish the office another Rs 1,000 crore for the remaining infrastructure,” P V K Raju said.

Adding further that one should make constructive criticism of the decisions of the regime, Raju said, “ I blame the present regime for the demolition of the Praja Vedika. That should not have been done. However, this is a welcome move, personally I welcome it, although my party’s stand might differ.” tnn

Visakhapatnam: City police, on Sunday, urged the residents of Visakhapatnam to utilise the police’s app Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS)—the e-surveillance system to prevent the possible burglaries in locked houses—during the upcoming Sankranti vacation.

The police said that if the people utilised LHMS in their houses, when property offender entered a locked house, the police would get a buzz and pictures from the CCTV cameras installed inside the house. The control center immediately informs the police station close to the house to prevent the burglary and nab the offenders.

ADCP (Crimes) V Suresh Babu said that burglars struck mostly during Sankranti festival as most people visit their hometowns during this time. “By giving few details, people can register in the app. And, just a day or two before going out of the station, they can put a request in the app giving the journey and return date. The police will install CCTV cameras at the house free of cost and the cameras are linked to the police control room. We have enough CCTV cameras and are ready to acquire more cameras for LHMS, if demand is there,” Suresh Babu added.

Tirupati: Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams trust board has decided to stick to traditions and observe Vaikunta Ekadasi for two days.

Speaking to reporters after an emergency trust board meeting held at Tirumala on Sunday, TTD chairman YV Subba Reddy said the TTD trust board had to convene an emergency meeting following the Andhra Pradesh high court’s direction to arrive at a conclusive decision over extending Vaikunta Ekadasi festivities for a period of 10 days.

“A PIL was filed in the high court seeking the court’s direction to the TTD to organise Vaikunta Ekadasi for a period of 10 days. The court had directed the TTD to convene a meeting and announce its decision. Today we have met following the high court order and have unanimously decided not to deviate from the set traditional practices. The Vaikunta Ekadasi festivities would be organised as they used to be during the previous years’‘, declared YV Subba Reddy.

Visakhapatnam: Advocates in the city are planning to take up the issue of grama nyayalaya (village court) with the state government. Despite orders of the AP high court to the state government last year regarding immediate establishment of village courts throughout the state, no initiative has been taken so far in this regard.

Grama nyayalayas are essential for speedier and easier delivery of justice and reducing the burden on the district judiciary. A public interest litigation (PIL) has also been filed by an advocate in the apex court and high court as states have not taken up the central subject seriously. Currently, grama nyayalayas are functional in 11 states.

Senior advocate Abdul Raqueeb said, “Non-establishment of grama nyayalayas frustrates the statutory rights provided to citizens under the Grama Nyayalaya Act and constitutional rights of rural citizens to access to justice under Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution. The AP government had also assented to set up 84 grama nyayalayas across 13 districts but not a single one has been set up. We the advocates from Vizag are asking the state government to allocate budget for earliest establishment of village courts in our district. A meeting by advocates and NGOs will also be held on Monday on this issue.”

“Grama nyayalayas have showed positive results in states where they are functioning, by providing easier access to justice, reducing arrears in the district judiciary, reducing workload on higher tiers of judiciary,” the advocate added.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

KOLKATA: BJP leader and former Bolpur MP Anupam Hazra has been accused of molestation, theft, assault and criminal intimidation after his alleged involvement in a bar brawl at a central Kolkata pub on Saturday night where he was partying with his friends. Hazra has denied all allegations, saying it was the complainant, who had actually misbehaved, and levelled the allegations as politically motivated. He even questioned the “police motive” to lodge the case without even “verifying the facts”.According to the complaint lodged by Kasba resident Suresh Roy, he saw Hazra partying with some women at the Hochi Minh Sarani pub and wanted to take his pictures. Hazra found him clicking the photographs and stopped him before an altercation began.“I didn’t know him before. A friend introduced me to him and while he was with a group of women, I took a few photographs on my cellphone from a distance. I had no bad intention and it was a rather general reaction on my part as Hazra is a celebrity. But that angered him. First, his security guard threatened me and forced me to delete the photos and then Hazra himself abused me before punching me on my face. When a friend accompanying me protested, he even pushed and abused her,” said Roy, a senior official at an e-commerce payment app company. He claimed that his gold chain was also lost.Roy said the assault continued even after he came out of the pub. “His men chased me threatening to kill me. As I was leaving the pub, his men kicked and damaged my car. I was hurt and shocked and went to the police station to lodge a complaint. By the time I was back with the cops, Hazra and his associates were gone,” Roy told TOI outside his Rajdanga Main Road home on Sunday.Cops said Roy and his friend had come to the pub and were introduced to Hazra by a common friend. Murlidhar Sharma, joint CP (crime), said the FIR was based on the complaint filed by Roy and that they were checking the sequence of events. “A probe is on and every aspect will be included in it. The FIR contains IPC sections pertaining to wrongful restraint, hurt, theft, molestation, criminal intimidation and mischief (341/323/379/354/506/427 of IPC),” said Sharma.The FIR, accessed by TOI, claims Hazra wrongfully restrained Roy, assaulted him with fists, blows and kick, snatched his gold chain weighing about 50 grams before physically assaulting his girlfriend. Hazra also allegedly threatened him with dire consequences and broke his mobile.Hazra, on his way to Katwa with BJP state president Dilip Ghosh for a CAA awareness campaign, made a Facebook video of 7 minutes 14 seconds, claiming the complaint was politically motivated and said he would file a counter-complaint.“I will take action against him for lying through his teeth and I will teach him a lesson through legal route. I was there at a friend’s birthday party when he came to me and said though he was a Trinamool supporter, he personally liked me. He asked for a selfie and I obliged. After some time, my security guards told me that he was clicking my pictures and recording videos from different angles. They told me he was sending them to someone through WhatsApp. When my guard challenged him, Roy abused him. He seemed drunk and was asked to leave. In the morning, I came to know that he has lodged an FIR against me. I fail to understand how the police here, which take time to even lodge murder cases in Bengal, acted so swiftly on the words of a man, who himself was creating a nuisance, and lodged an FIR without even a primary probe,” claimed Hazra.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73114708,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-140906,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/molest-charge-against-bjp-leader-after-brawl-at-city-pub/articleshow/73114031.cms

CM Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Anshil Goel, an MBA graduate from the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, is involved in the Aam Aadmi Party’s assembly election campaign. Many professionals like Goel have taken a sabbatical from work or are contributing part-time to make Arvind Kejriwal Delhi’s chief minister again. These faceless supporters are powering the party’s electioneering machinery.

Goel conducts campaign training sessions for the volunteers engaged in the ‘Kejriwal Fir Se’ campaign, prepares PowerPoint presentations, helps supervise the party’s WhatsApp campaigns and takes up other chores. “We have been countering the negative campaign spiels of our rival parties on social media,” says Goel.

One of the volunteers is Vihang Jumle, a computer engineer. “Political conditions in the country will impact my future, so I want to be a part of making a change,” says the 22-year-old. “I believe that society’s involvement in politics is necessary to create a progressive state.” Jumle works for AAP in the time he has off from work.

Another volunteer is Ghaziabad resident Rishabh Mishra. The postgraduate in management from Annamalai University is preparing for admission to a US university. “I compared education, health and government facilities in Ghaziabad with those in Delhi and decided I needed to help the government that has done good work,” says Mishra. He has been engaged in training volunteers and has completed over 20 meeting with such groups in various assembly constituencies.

The Kejriwal Fir Se campaign, launched in November, has attracted over 60,000 people from different parts of Delhi-NCR. AAP’s backend team has been reaching out to volunteers, briefing them at the party headquarters or at offices of MLAs. They will be involved in social media and phone campaigns and in other outreach exercises.

Yatharth, a Laxmi Nagar resident, who recently wrote his final chartered accountancy exam, was drawn to AAP after being admitted to Dr Hedgewar Arogya Sansthan in Shahdara, east Delhi, after an accident. “During my treatment at the hospital, I realised how much the facility had transformed, so I thought that while waiting for my CA results, I should volunteer for AAP,” says Yatharth, who has been assigned the task of training new volunteers.

AAP wants make development its main plank in the assembly polls, likely in the first week of February. The volunteers have been asked to publicise the report card prepared by the party on its five-year rule among the people. The report lists, among others, achievements in education and health, provision of free electricity, connecting 97% of the city colonies with piped water, installation of 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras and infrastructure development in unauthorised colonies.

Pratik Bhatia had phoned over 1,500 Delhiites in the past month to seek their feedback on the Kejriwal government’s performance. “I have submitted the data to the party,” says Bhatia, who too is awaiting his CA final results.

Some volunteers are sending out text messages. Others are carrying out the ‘Buzz Campaign’, spreading word about the AAP government’s accomplishments

He said that the current government of Andhra Pradesh had made some announcements on the capital, and they have to come clear on that. “There could be lot of differences between the political parties on the capital, but they should be resolved though meaningful discussions,” he said. He said there is need to give confidence to the farmers. “The situation of confusion and tension is not good for any state,” he said.

HYDERABAD: The state government is constructing child-friendly rooms in all jails for conducting test identification parade (TIP) in the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences ( Pocso ) Act cases.

The HC had issued guidelines to the government following a case of severe trauma of a child witness in a Posco case during a TIP in the jail. After Tihar jail, Telangana is the first state to have such a facility.

Inspector-general of police (law and order) and in-charge of SHE Teams and Bharosa had written to the registrar of administration of the HC. In the letter, the officer requested the HC to issue guidelines like the Delhi HC in the case of Rakesh Kumar versus State to establish child-friendly rooms for TIP proceedings.

The Juvenile Justice Committee held a meeting on August 26, 2019, and passed an order and directed the DG (prisons and correctional services) to set up child-friendly rooms in all jails. The accused would be identified by the child victims, below 12 years, through a semi-reflective screen.

Dr Mamata Raghuveer of Taruni told TOI, “As per guidelines, in every case, where the witness is below 12 years, TIP proceedings shall be held in one of the rooms attached with the main jail so that the child does not enter the jail complex to reach the Test Identification parade room.”

HYDERABAD: BJP Telangana president K Laxman on Sunday asked Hyderabad member of Parliament and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi to not instigate people.

Interacting with the media, he said: “AIMIM is limited to the city. If they don’t explain things properly to people, they will be taught a lesson.” He also said that BJP would fight the ensuing municipal elections alone.

He alleged that AIMIM was giving communal colour to issues. “The party is trying to instigate people. When a Muslim woman (writer Taslima Nasreen) came from Bangladesh, they tried to attack her,” he said.

“When Pakistan is an Islamic country and has a relevant constitution, why not so in India,” he questioned. He lambasted TRS for working for the interests of AIMIM. “In the municipal polls, AIMIM is trying to take control of the state in guise of TRS. There is no difference between Congress, TRS and AIMIM. We will fight all wards and corporations alone,” he said.

There are only two statues of Bajirao Peshwa – one at Pune and the other at Dubere. The troop visited Barve Palace and saw Ahilyabai’s well with stairs, a collection of weapons, structure of the kitchen, wooden doors, Bajirao’s room where he was born, their family tree, etc. The ninth descendant of Bajirao Peshwa, Chandrashekhar Barve, showed them around and told the anecdotes of the ancestry. A small forest of 120 tamarind trees fascinated the crowd the most.

They also visited the gram panchayat of the village and spoke to the sarpanch . “It was an exposure to the villagers and the panchayat members were happy to see a crowd visit their existence. It was also a great experience for the visitors to see that their villages are historically prosperous.

NEW DELHI: A gang from Nuh in Mewat that would give a lift in their car to commuters on the Mahipalpur-Gurugram route and robbed them mid-way has been busted.

The case was cracked by using cellphone analysis during which police studied around 25,000 numbers active around the scene of crime. After a month-long investigation, police arrested two of the prime accused.

“The accused — Alim Khan (27) and Faizel (25) — are residents of Nuh. Faizel’s father is the pradhan of the village. Three of their associates have been identified and will be nabbed soon. The accused would carry multiple numberplates and change them to avoid the vehicle from being identified,” said additional DCP (Southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh.

On December 5 last year, the gang had targeted Krishan Kumar, a supervisor working at IGI Airport. He took a lift in an Ertiga around 8.15pm from Mahipalpur Chowk road for Shankar Chowk in Gurugram. Kumar told police that 3-4 people were already in the car. As the car crossed the border, they snatched his mobile phone, Rs 8,000 cash and left him near Shankar Chowk. They also took his debit card and forced him to reveal the PIN.

A case was registered at Vasant Kunj (South) police station.

441,['6/01/2020'],JD(U) general secretary urges CM Nitish Kumar to reject NPR,"This story is from January 6, 2020

CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: A day after Bihar deputy CM and BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said the National Population Register ( NPR ) would be updated in the state from May 15 to June 28 this year, ally JD(U)’s national general secretary Pavan K Varma on Sunday asked party chief and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to categorically reject the ‘divisive CAA-NPR-NRC scheme’.

In an open letter to JD(U) chief, Varma expressed surprise at the “unilateral” announcement of SuMo. However, the controversy over NPR in the state took a new turn on Sunday after the SuMo’s office released the state government’s notification on December 18 last year to carry out the updation process of the NPR from May 15 to June 28. “Using the powers conferred under the Census Act-1948, the governor of Bihar hereby issues orders that the work of house listing, house census and updation of the NPR will be carried out from May 15 to June 28, 2020 in state of Bihar as part of first phase of Census of India-2021,” the notification signed by the state’s additional chief secretary (revenue and land reforms) and state coordinator, census, Vivek Kumar Singh, reads.

Varma has been critical of his party’s decision to support the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament. “ ... in consonance with your own publicly stated views, and long established secular vision, may I request you now to take a principled stand against the CAA-NPR-NRC scheme, and reject its nefarious agenda to divide India and create a great deal of unnecessary social turbulence. A clear-cut public statement by you to this effect would be a major step towards preserving and strengthening the idea of India to which, I know, you yourself are committed. The politics of principle cannot be sacrificed at the altar of short-term political gain,” Varma, a former diplomat, wrote in his two-page letter.

Varma said the government has categorically stated that the NPR is the first step to implementing the NRC and since Kumar has said that Bihar will not have the NRC, it follows that he must say no to the revised NPR as well. “The central government needs to focus on the real priorities of governance, such as the disastrous state of the economy, the absence of jobs, and agrarian distress, rather than such schemes whose only aim is to destroy the unity and social cohesion of our great country,” Varma said.

Reacting over Varma’s letter, Bihar BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said, “Why you are misinterpreting that our Dy CM Sushil Modi has unilaterally announced the start of NPR exercise in Bihar. Everyone knows and you also know the fact that #Census and #NPR is a nationwide exercise which is going to start at the same time in all given states. This is to inform you that Bihar government has already notified the updation of NPR with reference to Census 2021 which will be done between May 15 and June 28, 2020. As Bihar government has already notified on above issue, you can take back the letter accusing our deputy CM,” Nikhil urged Varma.

Members of the Rohingya community in Balapur, Old City are wary of what future has in store for them

HYDERABAD: More than 6,000 Rohingya Muslims living in the state are wary of the repercussions that the much-debated Citizenship Amendment Act( CAA ) will have with regard to them.

Telangana government had recently reported the number of refugees in the state to the Centre. G Kishan Reddy, Union minister of state for home, had raised questions on how members of the community who had to flee Burma to escape ethnic violence had reached as far as Hyderabad. Most members of the community reside in the Balapur area of Old City.

When TOI visited one of the Rohingya colonies in the city, few members who were aware of the Act said that they were hopeful that the cards from United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) would protect them. “We are not aware of the implications of the new Act. Most of us have the UNHCR card and these cards are our only hope,” said Abdullah ( name changed) .

Each refugee colony has more than 300 people, with an average of five people living in one room. “We do not have any certificates to go looking for better work. We do not have any other identity card expect the UNCHR car. Our children study in local schools but are not even allowed to write exams sometimes” said a colony member on condition of anonymity.

Another worry is that most students who have completed their education or written an exam are not being given certificates by schools.

However, Rohingya Muslims are thankful to the local people who have been extending support to them. “ We have to pay a rent of Rs 800 even for a tiny room. Giving us these small sheds for rent is a big help to us,” they said. As members of the community are not eligible for loans, locals help them by taking loans on their name and providing the money to the refugees.

“We do not have any choice to stay back here unless the conditions in our country improve. We have no choice. Who wants to live like this in another country?” they said.

Rohingya Muslims, who according to locals moved to the city in 2014 ,earn their livelihood in the city by taking up manual labour. While most men go for construction work in adjoining areas, women do household work or take up menial jobs at local stores.

HYDERABAD: A tip-off from a local resident about villagers taking out a procession of buffaloes in Mutpoor village of Kondurg mandal in Rangareddy district before sacrificing them helped save the animals. City-based animal activists immediately responded to the alert and took help from the district collector and local police to stop the ritual.

The incident came to light on Saturday night after a villager shared a video of the procession with the activists.

Locals said every five years villagers conduct a ritual where five buffaloes are left on the streets for two years before capturing and torturing them until they are unable to stand. Later, the animals are sacrificed. Animal Welfare Board of India has issued an advisory to all governments and animal husbandry departments last year to stop animal sacrifices.

“We had to take the help of the police and collector to stop the sacrifice. However, the police could recover only two buffaloes while the other three are still suspected to be with the villagers. If not for the video which was circulated on WhatsApp, the entire village would have come together to beat these buffaloes the night after the procession and then kill them in the name of God, believing it will ward off evil,” said Compassionate Society for Animals founder NS Pravalika.

Kozhikode: A total of 1,760 student volunteers of 88 government and aided schools in the district will commence door-to-door survey next week to identify people with the habit of smoking .

The survey under the ‘ Quit to Care-Anti Smoking Campaign ’ is being carried out to encourage people to quit smoking to lead a healthy and disease-free life.

Considered to be first of its kind of project in the state initiated on an experimental basis jointly by the district health department, national health mission, education department and excise department, it aims to create awareness among public about the ill effects of smoking, tobacco usage and drug abuse and to help them to get rid of the habit to lead a healthy life.

Under the project, experts have already imparted training to 176 selected student volunteers and teachers of the 88 schools in the initial phase to carry out anti-smoking campaign.

The teachers from each school have been selected as nodal officer of the project for the effective execution. The trained volunteers then imparted training classes to 20 members in each school.

The health department has already set up clinics at the 16 health blocks to help the persons who wish to quit smoking. It has already deployed more than 100 trained counsellors and 40 doctors at the health clinics to help the smokers quit smoking.

According to the health department officials, each student volunteers will adopt five persons each. They can adopt their family members, friends or relatives to help them to quit smoking.

In Kozhikode, a total of 1,760 student volunteers will adopt 8,800 persons to encourage them to quit smoking.

Detailing the project, Dr A Naveen, district programme manager of NHM said that the student volunteers will conduct survey in the second week of January to identify causes for smoking, ill effects of smoking to their health and ill effects of passive smoking to the family members.

“The major highlight of the project is that it will not force people to quit smoking. Instead, the student volunteers with the help of counsellors and doctors will lend a helping hand to people who come forward voluntarily expressing keenness to get rid of their smoking habits by diverting their attention towards various activities and through counselling.

The schools which showcases outstanding performance in the project execution will be rewarded in June.

A series of public campaigns will be conducted to garner public support for the cause. Apart from this, the scheme also targets parents and tips will be given to them for the early detection of usage of tobacco and drug abuse among their children.

“We have also included IT companies and other organizations to take part in the quite to care challenge and received positive response from cyber park and business schools,” he said.

He was speaking at the Ekjoot’ initiative of Vidarbha Sahitya Sangh (VSS). The environment-themed programme was inaugurated by Sahitya Akademi Award winner Prof Madhusudan Penna of Kavikulguru Kalidas Sanskrit University, Ramtek.

On the occasion, journalists Vijay Pinjarkar of ‘The Times of India’ and Ramesh Marulkar of ‘The Hitavada’ were honoured with the ‘Ekjoot Paryavaran Puraskar’ for their outstanding work in the field of environment. Environmental activists Sampada and Sanjay Karkare and veteran bird expert Gopal Thosar were also felicitated.

Arya said, “Now, Chennai is the first city in the country to completely run out of underground water. All of it is used up by man. Hence, we need to bring a change in our personal, professional and public lives.”

He said, “The world’s largest garbage pile is in Delhi. It is spread over 70km and has over 140 crore tonne of garbage. It is perhaps taller than the Qutub Minar. It is a matter of shame for us.”

Arya suggested that to curb the raging environmental problems, one needs to create awareness, start a public movement and garner mass support for it.

Delivering the inaugural address, Penna said, “The problem with today’s generation is that there is a ‘give and take’ attitude among all. No one wants to be selfless and because of that the nature is being disturbed. Ancient ‘Vedas’ also had a vision as regards to the environment but unfortunately today that has been lost.”

Penna pointed out how man only considers what is important to him and how he can exploit it for his own happiness. “Our selfish and narrow vision is causing irreparable damage to the environment. We need to realize that ultimately it will be our mental and physical state that will be affected by a deteriorating environment.”

He further said that a man who calls himself a ‘spiritual master’ or a ‘bhakt’ but exploits nature then he is ‘absolutely nothing’. “Environment is not just a word, it’s the truth. And if we don’t understand it and restore its balance, we will have to pay a hefty price for the same,” he said.

Broken stone slabs have been lying on the broken footpath for a long while

GURUGRAM: For residents and commuters in Sector 57 , an extra 20 to 30 minutes is one they have to factor in every day.

First, there is the 1.7-km stretch between Tigra and Samaspur . Broken stone slabs have been lying on the broken footpath for a long while. So have exposed power lines.

“Last week, my nephew’s bike rammed into a stone slab along the footpath. He lost balance and almost fell into a ditch. They talk of green cover for footpaths . What we see are the few paths for pedestrians dug up for laying power lines, construction and demolition waste lying around,” said Ramesh Chauhan, a B1 block resident of Sector 57.

The state of these paths means people avoid walking. That means more vehicles on the road , and more pollution.

“The hospital where I work is just 2km from my house. I should be able to walk to work every day. But the pavements are broken, so I take my scooty,” said Neeta (name changed), who works as a medical assistant at a hospital nearby.

A few kilometres ahead, another problem comes up. If the state of pavements is bad, that of roads is nothing to write home about either. The roundabout on Golf Course Road, for instance, is broken in several patches.

“For the most part, the road is great. But the moment you enter the roundabout, the road is broken and has not been maintained for what seems like ages. I get stuck for a good 20 minutes every day while dropping my kids off to school,” said Nina Ganpathy, a resident of Sector 58.

Because of the condition of the road, it has turned into a chokepoint. It has been this way for two years now but nothing has been done to fix this. “The authority should build an underpass if it can’t fix the road,” Ganpathy said.

The authority, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, could not be reached for comment.

HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had laid the foundation stone for a new Secretariat complex June 27, 2019, after all ministers and state departments were shifted out of the spacious Secretariat building to a temporary mini-Secretariat in BRKR Bhavan and other officers across the city. However, no work has begun to either demolish the old buildings or construct the new one.Roads and buildings minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy and the department officials have refused to speak on the project as it is being directly looked into by CM K Chandrasekhar Rao. However, sources said even tenders have not been called to either demolish the existing buildings or construct a new Secretariat complex.People coming from various districts particularly Adilabad and Bhadradri-Kothagudem, are finding it difficult to meet the officials and ministers as their offices are scattered across the city. For example, people coming to meet the animal husbandry department officials have to go to their office in Shantinagar at Masab Tank. Same is the case with people wanting to meet officials in the welfare department as minister Koppula Eshwar now has his office in Sankshema Bhavan at Masab Tank.The CM carries out his duties from Pragathi Bhavan or his farmhouse in Erravelli. However, the chief minister’s office (CMO) is located in HMR Bhavan at Rasoopura. Finance minister T Harish Rao has his office in Aranya Bhavan.“The problem is that the officials are not available even in BRKR Bhavan, the complex which accommodates most of the government departments at present.

CHENNAI: If commuting in metro trains make travel faster and comfortable, purchasing a ticket for the ride at the stations is quite the opposite.

Commuters complain that ticket vending machines (TVM) are slow, reject notes introduced after demonitisation or do not work at all. “The machines reject some old currency notes also,” said M Bhaskar, a resident of Anna Nagar .

TVMs were installed at stations to encourage passengers to purchase tickets or top up smartcards on their own and avoid queues. But with currency notes being rejected and the machines becoming slower, the process has become time-consuming.

The frustration does not end there. When commuters turn to ticket counters after finding TVMs faulty, the counter staff insists on digital payment. “What if I do not carry card and the ticket machines don’t work? Will they deny me a ticket,” asked S Vidya Sagar, a regular commuter from T Nagar.

A metro rail official said the problem with TVMs is in its software, and they have contacted the Japanese company that manufactured the machines to rectify them.

Initially, the TVMs were upgraded to accept new currency notes. “The software update was done to accept the dimensions of the new notes. But later when another new set of notes were introduced, there were difference in the size of the notes. So the machines reject them. We have contacted the manufacturer to resolve the problem soon,” the official said.

KOLKATA: The state has started assessing the impact on the public transport and goods movement in the city if the scrapping age of commercial vehicles comes down to 10 years from the existing 15. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked the state why it was not lowering the scrapping age to 10 to reduce the noxious fumes in the city’s ambient air.The scrapping age for commercial vehicles in National Capital region (NCR) is 10. Since Kolkata is close to Delhi in pollution, the city needs to get rid of its old diesel vehicles to avoid further damage to theambient air. However, preliminary assessment showed that public transport and goods vehicles movement in the city would be hit hard, if the state government scrapped such diesel vehicles.The initial findings by a state panel revealed that an enormous number of diesel vehicles would be disallowed to ply, if the scrapping age is reduced to ten years, a transport department officer said.“The assessment revealed that 2,22, 881 commercial vehicles will attain 10 years by April 1, 2020. The number of goods vehicles attaining 10 years by that time will be 1,26,807. Number of buses that will be 10 years old is 22,277. So, the impact on public transport and goods vehicles movement will be quite telling. But keeping in mind the city’s degrading air quality, we have to reduce the city’s diesel fleet,” a Nabanna source said.“A massive number of metered cabs, too, will have to be scrapped. Almost 94% of the metered cab fleet is plying for over 10 years.Nearly 99% of commercial vehicles are diesel-run. A large number of private vehicles are also diesel-run, thanks to the subsidy that diesel still enjoys,” said Subhas Datta, the anti-pollution campaigner.The only option left for the state to evade lowering the scrapping age for commercial vehicles is to shift to cleaner fuels like CNG.

Police barricade near Kalindi Kunj metro (File Photo)

NEW DELHI: As rumours about police evicting the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters from Shaheen Bagh flew thick and fast on Sunday, widespread confusion prevailed.

There were heated arguments between protesters and the cops, after which the former allegedly broke the grilles of the central verge and set up further blockades on Kalindi Kunj road in the evening. Police said that the rumours started after they started removing the barricades to redeploy them elsewhere.

A minor argument that ensued fuelled the fire on social media. Many took to Twitter and alleged “increased police presence and uneasiness at Shaheen Bagh”. There were also allegations of “use of force to clear the road”.

Delhi Police maintained that they had been requesting the protesters to call off their agitation for past several days. A series of tweets about CRPF being called in and cops trying to instill fear were doing rounds on social media. The police sought to quell these rumours.

Some protesters at Shaheen Bagh claimed that police presence had been increased on Sunday. Police, however, denied this.

PANAJI: In a mark of solidarity towards staffers and students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi, who were brutally attacked by masked individuals on Sunday, a gathering of Goans held a protest against the attack at Azad Maidan, Panaji, on Monday.

The small group soon swelled to nearly 300 participants as people from various walks of life started singing ‘Hum honge kamyaab’ and shouting slogans like ‘Azaadi’ in the peaceful protest.

The protesters also demanded the sacking of JNU’s vice-chancellor and the resignation of Union home minister Amit Shah.

Citing his disgust at the ongoing violence, former JNU alumni and visiting professor at the Goa University Peter D’Souza said that there was no such violence on the university’s campus during his student days.

“Foreign minister S Jayshankar, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Niti Ayog CEO Amitabh Kant are my JNU batchmates. They should speak up against what has happened or their affiliation to JNU should be withdrawn,” D’Souza said.

Calling the attack on students as an attack on the future of India, former JNU alumni and professor of sociology at the State University of New York, Ravi Palat, said, “Yogendra Yadav and teachers were beaten up in front of the police. The JNU we went to was a place of fierce debate, not violence.”

Condemning the violence, Goa University Teachers’ Association (GUTA) urged JNU’s teaching community to mediate and find ways of ensuring that the administrative and academic ambience of the university is not disrupted. GUTA also requested JNU authorities to identify the perpetrators of violence, irrespective of their political orientation, and take disciplinary action against those out to destroy the very idea of the university.

The protest also saw the participation of various activists and representatives of political parties.

MADURAI: Setting aside the conviction and sentence awarded by a lower court in a rape case, the Madras high court acquitted a man citing that the woman admitted to filing a false complaint.

The prosecution had alleged that Subramanian and the woman, who is the complainant, are relatives and that he had raped her before they got married. He also stated that the appellant’s parents abused the woman demanding dowry, following which she lodged a police complaint. The Thiruppathur All Women Police had registered a case against him under IPC sections 417, 376, 498 (A), 294(b) and 506(ii), while case was registered against three of his family members under IPC section 498(A).

The Sivaganga sessions cum mahalir neethi mandran had convicted and sentenced the appellant to 10 years imprisonment under IPC section 376 (punishment for rape) and acquitted the rest. The appellant filed an appeal before the high court in 2014.

Justice M Nirmal Kumar observed that the woman had admitted that she had lodged a false complaint in order to unite with her husband, who is the appellant. The judge cited that the appellant had also obtained divorce through the Sivaganga sub-court as the two had entered in a joint compromise. The judge further noted that the woman expressed her willingness to settle this issue.

The judge further observed that as per the report of the radiologist, the woman was between 18 and 19 years of age at the time of the incident and hence the offence of rape would attract as per IPC section 376(i) as they had physical relationship with the woman with her consent.

HYDERABAD: Increased liquor sales in view of the municipal elections this month is expected to help the state government recover from the fund crunch that resulted due to dip in revenue from various departments.

The state government had earned Rs 1,800 crore from liquor sales during the general elections in April last year and is likely to net another Rs 500 crore this election season thanks to the price hike recently. Officials said there has been a slight drop in beer sales due to price hike, but it is likely to pick up soon.

Along with liquor shops belt shops are also hoping for good business with local leaders stocking up on liquor in bulk, sources said, adding that the buyers are mainly aspirants who are likely to get tickets for the municipal polls .

According to a report prepared by the Comptroller Auditor General (CAG) for the fiscal year upto October 2019, there has been a significant drop in revenue but income from the excise department helped the state government float.

NAGPUR: The couple, Puja Nagdeve and Mithun Sarode, held from an alleged flesh trade den near Trimurti Nagar, walked free a day after the action as Rana Pratap Nagar police could not take them in remand custody for questioning. The Social service branch (SSB) of crime branch had busted the den last week rescuing three women from the spot.

Nagdeve and Sarode had been operating the flesh trade den behind the garb of a salon and spa for a long time before it was busted. Two mobile phones were seized from the couple. It was reliably learnt the mobile phones had several contact details and social networking contents in them which remain to be probed. Police had tried to conduct a raid on this couple in the past too but could not find success. Unconfirmed sources claimed that the couple also had some close contacts in police too.

According to a senior official, crime branch has now stopped investigating cases after raids and have started handing them over to the concerned police stations. “The raid had to be conducted by the crime branch as local police did not take action on the same racketeers. Many times the racketeers enjoy protection of the local police. It’s natural that the local police would not do justice with the case if crime branch hands it over to them and on the contrary they would protect them,” said a reliable source.

In the past, SSB unit had taken remand custody of the racketeers in after raids on many occasions. In a latest case of red-light area of Ganga Jamuna, SSB had tried to probe deeper after taking remand custody of the accused arrested during the raids. The accused women were sent to jail after spending couple of days in police remand during which custodial interrogation had been done.

Rana Pratap Nagar polices’ role is under scanner not only for allowing an easy bail for the racketeer couple in the latest case but also for their apathy to come down heavily on a thriving flesh trade den at Khamla chowk being run by two women. Two notorious women partners are operating the den. They used to earlier operate from another apartment at Khamla but had to shift near a lawn as local residents had started raising protests.

The women are learnt to be offering their customers with models from Delhi and soon expected to receive some girls from Mumbai. The Mumbai-based girls are offered to the customers as film or television actors and are known to fetch high rates.

Senior PI Kishor Parvate of SSB said he would initiate action if there is any concrete information about the den and their operators.

Madurai: Setting aside the Thanjavur collector’s order which rejected an arbitration application on the ground that it was filed outside the prescribed period, the Madras high court held that there is no time limit specified for applying before the arbitrator under the National Highways Act , 1956.

Justice S S Sundar observed that even otherwise if the Limitation Act, 1963, was applied in the case, the period prescribed under section 137, which is applicable in the present case, the appeal was filed well before time.

“From the facts of the case in hand, this court is satisfied that the appeal had been filed within the prescribed time. Hence, this court has no hesitation to hold that the order passed by the collector dismissing the appeal on the ground of limitation is not only illegal on accounts of the judgements of the earlier division bench of this court, but also by accepting the case of the collector regarding application of Limitation Act,” observed the judge.

The petitioner, J Krishnappa, owns a land measuring 2,450 square metre at Ukkarai Vattam at Thathuvachary village in Thanjavur district. The special district revenue officer (land acquisition) acquired the said extent of land from the petitioner for the purpose of laying road for national highways (NH 45C) from Vikkiravandi to Thanjavur via Kumbakonam in 2016.

Since the compensation determined by the special district revenue officer was far below market value, the petitioner had submitted a representation for referring the dispute to the arbitrator, who is the district collector. The petitioner also filed an appeal as contemplated under section 3(G)(5) of National Highways Act and the same was rejected by the collector on ground that the petition filed by the petitioner is beyond the period of limitation prescribed.

The petitioner moved the court challenging the rejection order passed by the collector dated November 2, 2019.

The judge observed that this court in earlier judgments had taken a view that the National Highways Act does not prescribe a period of limitation for appeal and that when an order of the land acquisition officer fixing compensation is challenged before the arbitrator under the National Highways Act, the application cannot be dismissed on the ground that the reference is barred by limitation.

The judge set aside the rejection order and directed the collector to entertain the petitioner’s appeal and pass final orders after hearing the petitioner and considering all the documents within six weeks.

Congress MPs Uttam Kumar Reddy , A Revanth Reddy and Komatireddy Venkat Reddy hit the campaign trail in the municipal areas of their respective parliamentary constituencies. Finance minister T Harish Rao and other TRS ministers, too, campaigned at various places in the state.

Making sensational claims on Saturday, TPCC working president and Malkajgiri MP, A Revanth Reddy, said: “There could be danger to the life of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.

HYDERABAD: A software professional was arrested by Madhapur police on Sunday for misbehaving with a 28-year-old pregnant professional. Police said the accused, Chandrasekhar (32), from Ayyappa Society in Madhapur, earlier worked in the United States and is currently unemployed.

The incident took place at around 11pm on January 2, when the victim was returning to her office in Madhapur after having dinner with her husband. “When the victim’s husband left and she was walking back to her office, the accused started walking towards her and touched her inappropriately,” Madhapur sub-inspector K Harika said.

The victim, who works as an employee relationship manager, said: “When I confronted him, he said he didn’t do anything. I was angry and started hitting him. He started hitting me back and I screamed for help. Some men standing nearby intervened and stopped him.”

The victim immediately dialled 100 and also informed her colleagues and her husband about the incident. “In the police station, his family members requested me not to file a case. I did not pay heed to their request as he needs to be punished for his misbehaviour,” the victim added.

Police registered a case against the accused under Sections 354-a (sexual harassment) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The accused was produced before a court on Saturday and was sent to judicial remand.

466,['6/01/2020'],Facelift for CVR flyover soon to ease bumpy commute,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Vijayawada: The dilapidated state of the Chanumolu Venkat Rao (CVR) flyover has turned commuting on the stretch a hazardous experience. Delay by the roads and buildings department in conducting repair works has left the flyover pothole-ridden and with iron grills protruding from the surface at many places.

Commuting on the road at night has also become dangerous in view of the low illumination on the flyover.

Repair works on the flyover were taken up in October 2018 and traffic diverted. However, potholes soon developed on the road.

Delay in taking up repair works by the roads and buildings department has prompted the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) to take up the work with funds under the 14th Finance Commission. Speaking to TOI, VMC chief engineer Damavarapu Marianna said an estimate of Rs 70 lakh has been prepared to take up repair works and the tendering process is underway. “This time, we are taking up the complete overhaul of the flyover with rust-proof treatment and additional black-top layers. We will also install solar studs and road markings. Repair works will commence within the next 15 days,” said Marianna.

The 1,396m-long flyover has four approach roads and handles heavy vehicular movement on the Vijayawada-Hyderabad route.

Traffic on the flyover increased after traffic diversions were imposed across the city to facilitate Kanaka Durga flyover construction work. Though the curbs were partially eased recently, all heavy vehicles from Vijayawada towards Gollapudi have to use the CVR flyover .

Within the city as well, the flyover handles heavy traffic with approaches to Railway Wagon Workshop, One Town area and Vissannapet and connects Milk Factory and Nainavaram.

The flyover has also suffered further damage with increased vehicular movement and plying of heavy vehicles after traffic towards Hyderabad was diverted from the flyover.

NEW DELHI: Four people, including a historysheeter, have been arrested for running an organised inter-state network of sale and purchase of illicit liquor. The accused were arrested after a brief shootout in Dwarka on Saturday. Two police officers sustained injuries in the scuffle while one of the accused sustained a gunshot wound. Meanwhile, three other gang members managed to escape.

The four accused have been identified as Amit (28) — a known criminal of Palam Village and involved in eleven criminal cases previously; Anil (26), involved in five criminal cases; Karan, also involved in five criminal cases and Pradeep.

Police said that a patrolling team of constable Jai Kishan and constable Subash in Sitapuri Part-II noticed a man was removing some cartons from a red Swift Dzire. On questioning, the man identified as Karan told the police that he works for Amit and had come to supply liquor to Vishnu.

The cops reloaded the illicit liquor back to the car and directed Karan to come to the police station with them. Kishan sat in the Swift car along with Karan, who was driving the car. In the meantime, a Scorpio car with six persons came from towards Chankya Place and stopped the other car. Kishan was pulled out from the car by the accused and assaulted.

During the scuffle, constable Kishan kept his grip over his pistol and he fired a round in the air and another towards the ground to save himself. The round fired on the ground hit Amit’s ankle. On seeing this, three accused managed to flee with the liquor.

470,['6/01/2020'],Fraudsters target payment app users; cops take to Twitter to alert citizens,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Representative image

KOLKATA: Police have issued an alert, asking users of e-commerce payment apps to be aware of the fraudsters who are posing as customer service operators of various companies and duping people. They indulge people to install a screen sharing app, by which they get access to mobile screens and steal money from their accounts as they get to know the details of debit and credit cards and OTPs received by people while making transactions.

Over the last two months, the cyber crime department of Kolkata Police has been flooded with such complaints that made Murli Dhar Sharma, the joint commissioner (crime), to take to Twitter , alerting people about the fraud.

“Dear Netizens, in last few days we received a number of complaints related to PaytmKYC fraud. Here is how fraudsters trap customers. Please stay alert. Use our helpline 8585063104 for any help,” Sharma posted at 12.52pm on Sunday. Along with the post, he also attached a pinned tweet by Paytm Payment Bank’s official twitter handle where they explained about the fraudsters’ modus operandi.

“It seems that an organised gang from neighbouring states is behind the fraud and we are trying to nab them,” said a senior police officer.

The fake text messages sent to Paytm users read, “Dear customer, your PAYTM Wallet has been suspended. Please Complete Your PAYTM KYC. Contact Customer Care XXXXXXXXXX (mobile number of the fraudsters) or your account will be blocked after 24 hours. PAYTM Team”

As panicked customers called the numbers, the caller would ask them to install apps like TeamViewer, AnyDesk, QuickSupport etc and allow them certain permissions. Once the app is installed, a digital code is generated . When the code is shared, fraudsters can have access to the devices and use the mobile banking apps. They can make transactions from the UPI and wallets of people.

“Screen sharing apps like AnyDesk, Teamviewer or Quicksupport are legal and not malwares. These are tools for IT professionals to work on remote devices without being close to it,” said a senior cyber crime officer.

Classical singer Shantanu Bhattacharyya was duped of Rs 64,000 on January 2. “I didn’t know about the apps and didn’t realise the caller had access to my device. The caller made me add Rs 5 and Rs 10 to my Paytm account, using my debit and credit cards. I did accordingly and even put my CVV and OTPs to finalise the transaction. Within moments, Rs 64,000 was deducted from my account in multiple transactions,” said Bhattacharyya who lodged complaints with Anandapur police and Kolkata Police’s cyber crime division.

“I knew about frauds where criminals posed as bank managers seeking bank details. But this is absolutely a new way to dupe people,” he added. Another resident of Pailan, Sudipto Ghosh, had lost Rs 1.7 lakh on December 31. “The caller said if I don’t install the app and update it, Rs 10,000 kept in my Paytm account will be gone,” said Ghosh, who has also lodged a complaint with the cyber cell.

471,['6/01/2020'],A gift from the birthday boy,"This story is from January 6, 2020

When Dempo Sports Club walked inside the Cooperage, Mumbai's iconic football stadium in the heart of the city, they were surprised to see hundreds of fans, huddled in the stands, and cheering their favourite team, Orkay Mills.

Dempo had their own set of fans in this part of the world, but Orkay Mills were the new flavour in town. They had made it to the final of the Rovers Cup for the first time in 1979, and having made everyone sit up and take notice with a 5-3 demolition of mighty Mohun Bagan earlier in the competition, their stature locally had risen manifold.

As Dempo took the field to train on the eve of the final, Orkay Mills had already occupied the other half. There were fans all round and Dempo players could no longer ignore taunts that they would meet the same fate as Bagan.

""We tried our best to ignore everything and just focus on our job. We knew we had a great team and if we played to our potential, nobody could have stopped us,"" says Francis D'Souza, Dempo's star striker.

Dempo had already won the Rovers Cup in 1975, the first Goan team to inscribe their name on the famous trophy. But that triumph was soured by an abandonment on the first day due to crowd trouble and a last-minute penalty in the replayed final which Dempo won against Tatas.

""We had a point to prove after many said we were favoured by match officials who gifted us a last-minute penalty against Tatas,"" says defender Nicholas Pereira.

Dempo had little going for them. They had to travel home after securing a place in the semifinal because the organisers didn't have enough to pay for their lodging and boarding. When they returned to Mumbai for the final leg, they had little energy left as the 15-hour journey in a semi-luxury bus was physically draining.

In the semifinal against Premier Tyres from Kerala, they rarely got anything right in the first 45 minutes. They were sluggish, almost disjointed, and got their act together only after the change of ends with Joseph Machado scoring the only goal of the match.

In sharp contrast, Orkay Mills were on fire. Having knocked out Mohun Bagan, their confidence was sky-high, and they proved they were the best team in the competition when they got the better of local league champions Mafatlal SC 2-1 with Goa's very own, Bernard Pereira, scoring both goals.

Dempo and Orkay Mills had met a few months earlier in the Bandodkar Gold Trophy final in Goa with two matches played across two days failing to separate them. While the first day battle ended 1-1, the teams were tied goalless on the second day, prompting the organisers to declare them as joint winners.

Dempo had players with big-match experience. They had won the Stafford Challenge Cup in Bengaluru and Nizam Gold Cup in Hyderabad, so when the final kicked off inside a jam-packed stadium - almost 25,000 spectators with the gates being closed an hour before kickoff - they maintained their composure.

Nicholas Pereira and Daniel were excellent at the back, cutting off a wave of attack at the start with minimal fuss. Machado and Herbert San were doing all the good work in midfield, but it was Francis D'Souza who caught the eye.

The Dempo striker had international experience under his belt and a big reputation too. He was the best player at the Federation Cup in 1977, attracting the attention of Mohun Bagan, and finished as the leading goal-scorer at the National Football Championship for the Santosh Trophy in 1978. In the final, Francis -celebrating his 24th birthday - scored the opening goal inside 18 minutes, capitalising on a defensive lapse to slot the ball past India goalkeeper Shekhar Bangera.

When ends were changed, Orkay Mills clawed their way back in the 49th minute through the boots of Bernard. Orkay were now flying-high, but were brought back to earth by Francis who gave finishing touches to a through ball from Machado, six minutes later, as Dempo completed misra famous win.

DHAKA: An arrest warrant was issued against Bangladesh 's first Hindu chief justice Surendra Kumar Sinha on charges of embezzling 40 million taka, court officials said on Sunday. Sinha, 68, who lives in the US, has been described as a ""fugitive"" by the Anti-Corruption Commission in its charge-sheet.

Judge KM Emrul Kayesh of Senior Special Judges' Court took cognisance of the graft charges brought against Sinha and 10 othersby the ACC.

""The judge ordered his (Sinha's) arrest along with 10 others as the ACC accused him of misappropriating and laundering about 4 crore taka (approx Rs 3,38,70,732) in 2016,"" public prosecutor Taposh Kumar Pal said.

The development came three months after the ACC said it found evidence of fraud involving transactions of 40 million taka borrowed with fake documents by two businessmen from the Farmers Bank while the amount was deposited in Sinha's account. Sinha was chief justice of Bangladesh from January 2015 to November 2017.

473,['6/01/2020'],Stalled work on Nehru Stadium leaves Hubballi athletes worried,"This story is from January 6, 2020

HUBBALLI: Athletes were pleased, and were vocal in their appreciation of the Hubballi-Dharwad Smart Cities Ltd (HDSCL) when the officials proposed, and subsequently submitted their plan to give the Nehru Stadium in the city a much-needed facelift. However, the plan, submitted to the government for approval in September, is no closer to implementation than it was when it was conceived. Owing to a bureaucratic delay on the part of both the government and HDSCL, work on the stadium, in the centre of Hubballi city, is yet to start.

In the proposal submitted to the government, HDSCL had estimated the cost of refurbishing the stadium at Rs 28 crore. The stadium, completed in 1962, is the only competitive sports facility for the residents of Hubballi, where several local athletes have honed their skills in the nascent stages of their careers.

HDSCL special officer SH Naregal attributed the delay to a revision of the whole plan. He pointed out that the technical committee of the government had rejected an earlier proposal, wherein the cost of the project had been pegged at Rs 13 crore. “We had to scrap all our previous plans, when the whole proposal was revised. We are awaiting government’s approval for this new plan. We are hopeful of work beginning in 15 to 20 days. Verification of documents furnished by the private companies is a time-consuming process, and we will need at least 10 to 12 days to do this,” Naregal said.

The revised plan, which includes development of facilities for several other games, has received the nod of the technical committee, HDSCL officials said.

The ground, spread across 6.4 acres, has a pavilion for spectators spread across 3,945sqm of its area, while the playground itself sprawls across 21,304.7sqm. Apart from the pavilion and the playground, the ground houses a VIP building, a badminton court and adjunct structures, which cumulatively occupy 1,497sqm. After a thorough assessment of the Nehru Stadium’s capacity to accommodate facilities for other sports, HDSCL decided to embark on the venture.

Accordingly, as part of the renovation project, facilities are being developed for basketball , kabaddi, carom, chess , football and mat wrestling among other sports. The racing track will also being resurfaced as part of the plan, sources added.

Hubballi football player Muralidhar Rao said that athletes in the city were waiting for the renovation of the stadium to be completed with baited breath. “Once the stadium is renovated, it will surely help train budding athletes in Hubballi. The lack of adequate facilities is one of the reasons why many athletes cannot prepare fully for key tournaments and championships,” he said.

474,['6/01/2020'],Proposal for dedicated police station for BRTS lane being considered by govt,"This story is from January 6, 2020

HUBBALLI: The unveiling of the Hubballi-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System (HDBRTS) was greeted with as much gusto and delight by the residents of the twin cities as the completion of the first phase of ‘ Namma Metro ’ had been in Bengaluru. The wonders it has worked in easing commute between the two cities has also been accompanied by demands from regular travellers and officials of HDBRTS for improved policing on the 23-km long road. Now, in the wake of persistent demands from both the public and the officials, the government is mulling over setting up a police station for the dedicated bus lane.

The proposal to set up a separate station for the BRTS track was first submitted to the state government when MN Nagaraj was the commissioner of police for the twin cities. However, the government returned the proposal seeking clarification on a few aspects, following which, police commissioner R Dileep, along with Rajendra Cholan, managing director for BRTS, drafted a fresh proposal, which was submitted a few days ago. The officials concerned have given this proposal due consideration, and have reportedly reacted positively towards the proposal.

Dileep confirmed to TOI that a fresh proposal had been sent to the government. Stating that the idea was to have a full-fledged station with an inspector in-charge of running it, he added, “We have learnt that the government is inclined to approve the station. We will be able to disclose functional details such as the total number of personnel to be assigned to the station once we get the official sanction.”

Deputy general manager for HDBRTS Basavaraj Keri said that reports of accidents on the dedicated road, mostly owing to the illegal entry of other vehicles on to the lane, had raised concerns over the safety of passengers. “We have deployed security personnel at all the bus terminals along the road, and cops have been stationed at key intersections to prevent other vehicles from straying into the lane. But since the lane runs beside a road where there is no segregation of traffic, it is near impossible to prevent other vehicles from sliding into the dedicated road,” Keri said.

Another HDBRTS official said that most of the accidents on the dedicated lane had been reported on the outskirts of Hubballi and Dharwad. “With our limited resources, it is not possible to ensure adherence to traffic rules, which necessitates an exclusive police station for the BRTS lane,” he added.

Police, meanwhile, are of the opinion that an exclusive station for the corridor will reduce the pressure on the many cops deployed at various locations along the road. “Presently, they are burdened with twin responsibilities, of having to discharge duties assigned by their respective police stations and supervise traffic along the corridor,” a cop said.

MUMBAI: About a week after the headless body of a woman was found in Ghatkopar, the severed head of a woman was found in Kurla on Sunday evening. The police said that is quite likely that the head is of the same woman whose corpse was found last week.The severed head was found along the railway tracks below the Santacruz-Chembur Link Road. The police said that constable S Singhote from the crime branch stumbled upon a plastic bag with adhesive brown tape slapped over it. “The constable opened the bag and found the severed head inside,” said a senior official. “It was in a highly decomposed state.”On December 30 the woman’s body without the head and the legs up to the limbs had been found near the Naval gate. The portion below the knees was mutilated. Two days later, a pair of limbs, knee downwards, was found.The severed head bears long strands of hair, said a senior police official. “It is quite possible that it is of the same woman’s head. We have reason to believe that,” said the officer, refusing to specify the reasons.The police have sent the head to the civic-run Sion hospital where tests, including a DNA, will be done to check if all the severed parts — head, limbs below the knees and the rest of the body — are of the same woman, said the officer.“Now it should make matters easier to identify the woman,” said the senior official who is part a special probe team that has been formed to solve the case.A police official said that the body bears injuries all over. “It appears that the woman had a struggle with the killer or killers.

NEW DELHI: The new integrated battle groups (IBGs), which have now been tested on the western and eastern fronts for their capability to mobilise fast and hit hard, ""will fit well"" into the proposed creation of unified theatre commands in the country, says Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane .The creation of the agile and self-contained IBGs, each with around 5,000 soldiers and a varying mix of infantry, tanks, artillery, air defence, signals, engineers and other support units, is part of the ongoing restructuring of the 13-lakh strong Army's entire war-fighting machinery to ensure a better offensive punch.""The smaller battle groups will automatically be better for the theatre commands. We can allot IBGs, which will bring in more operational efficiency, to various theatres. But the conversion of Corps-sized formations (Army has 14 Corps, each with 40,000 to 60,000 troops) will take time,"" said Gen Naravane.But the Army chief is confident that the IBGs, after requisite government clearances, will take final concrete shape in ""a year or a year-anda-half"" from now after being war-gamed in exercises last year. The Army first tested the IBGs meant for Pakistan under the 9 Corps in the Chandimandir-based Western Command, in April-May.Then, the ""Him Vijay"" exercise was held in October to test the IBGs for mountain warfare in Arunachal Pradesh under the 17 Corps in the Kolkata-based Eastern Command. ""The reports are very encouraging. Those who participated in the exercise are all for IBGs now. The 'IBGization' of certain select Corps have now been practised on the ground with exercises,"" said Gen Naravane. For starters, the Army plans to carve out eight to 10 IBGs from the 9 Corps (headquarters at Yol, Himachal Pradesh), 17 Corps (Panagarh, West Bengal) and 33 Corps (Sukna, West Bengal). ""The entire Army will not rush headlong into the IBGs. We will first validate them on the ground and test their efficacy over three to four years in these three Corps,"" said a senior officer.The concept of composite and permanent IBGs, each commanded by a Major General, changes the existing operational structure of infantry, armoured, artillery and other combat support units coming together only during actual combat or exercises. Each IBG will also be specifically tailored to meet the nature of threat envisaged, the type of terrain involved and the task to be executed. So, for instance, the IBGs meant for Pakistan will be focused more on tanks and heavy artillery, while the ones for China will revolve more around infantry and light artillery due to the differing terrains, as was reported by TOI earlier.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73114423,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-229038,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/small-battle-groups-will-fit-well-in-theatre-commands-says-army-chief/articleshow/73114428.cms

CHENNAI: Monsoon may have ended but the city is likely to get light rain in the coming days.

A Met department forecast said, “The sky condition is likely to be generally cloudy. Light rain is likely to occur in some areas.” On Sunday, the city received a short but intense shower in some parts of the city around 9pm. The rain created puddles and made it difficult for pedestrians.

A Met official said conditions continue to be conducive for rain. “This is because the monsoon is getting extended. This may delay proper onset of winter.” However, the city already saw two days of fog.

Private weather blogger Pradeep John in a post said chances of rain exist for the next two days for Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Chennai. “It will be warmer than normal too till January 8, after which we can see some drop in temperature.” The maximum temperature is hovering around 30°C to 31°C.

Rise in green numbers as saplings now open forests

NEW DELHI: Thanks to a mix of compensatory plantation, afforestation and annual drives, Delhi’s green cover has more than doubled since 2001, up from 151sq km in 2001 to 324.4sq km in 2019. While Delhi’s green cover currently stands at 21.9% of the total area, forest officials say they are targeting 25% coverage by 2025.The latest India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2019, submitted by Delhi forest and wildlife department to the high court, said the city’s green cover was just 10.2% of the total area (at 151sq km) in 2001.The ISFR, carried out every two years, showed a substantial rise in 2003, with the cover increasing to 268sq km (18.1% of total area).Since then, the increase has been incremental, with a drop seen only in 2011, when green cover fell to 296.2sq km from 299.6sq km in 2009.Forest officials TOI spoke to said the data collated from ISFR reports was submitted to Delhi high court as an official document. “The initial sudden spike could be due to a change in methodology, but the general trend has been of a gradual rise. Through annual greening drives and compensatory plantation, saplings can take 4-6 years to mature completely and some of these are also reflected in 2-3 years through satellite imagery. We carry out vacancy filling to replace dead trees and saplings too,” Ishwar Singh, principal chief conservator of forests, Delhi forest department , said.Singh said the increase over the last two years was primarily due to a large number of saplings shifting from “scrub” to “open forest” category. “Plantations that have matured over the last two years are reflected in this year’s report and, since 2016, we have also recovered areas from encroachments, which have undergone fresh plantation.”In 2013, Delhi’s overall green cover was 20.1% of the total area, increasing to 20.2% in 2015 and 20.6% in 2017 (305.41sq km). In the next two years, a jump of around 6% was recorded, with the coverage increasing to 324.4sq km. In percentage terms, Delhi now has 21.9% of its geographical area under “green cover” — well above the standard of 20% for any city in the plains. “We have achieved the national target of a city that falls in the plains, but our internal target is to now reach 25% by 2025,” an official said.According to the submission made to the high court, another 6,500 hectares will need to be brought under green cover to reach that target. The focus areas are likely to be Yamuna floodplain and new city forests on gram sabha land. “Land recovered from encroachments will be used to carry out plantations,” another forest official said, adding that if the current pace was maintained, Delhi could actually reach the target by 2023.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73114487,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-806236,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/forest-department-delhis-green-cover-doubled-since-2001/articleshow/73114436.cms

Security personnel outside Matoshree in Mumbai (ANI photo)

MUMBAI: A farmer and his teenaged daughter were detained by police outside chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s residence, Matoshree, at Bandra (E), where they had come to air their grievances on Sunday morning.

Mahendra Deshmukh wanted to complain against a nationalised bank. Police said the bank claimed Deshmukh had defaulted on a Rs 8-lakh loan. However, Deshmukh said that he never received the amount.

Thackeray did not meet him but instructed police to find out Deshmukh’s grievance and let him off. Deshmukh, his wife and four daughters reside at Savane village in Panvel taluka, where he tills a five-acre plot and grows vegetables. Deshmukh sought an audience with Thackeray at Mantralaya. On Saturday, someone there told him he should try meeting Thackeray at Varsha, the official residence of CMs. Deshmukh said he spotted Thackeray at Sahyadri guest house at Malabar Hill but could not meet him, so he decided to go to Matoshree.

At 10.40am, Deshmukh and his 13-year-old daughter reached Matoshree and told security staff they had a letter for Thackeray. The staff told Deshmukh that it was the CM’s private residence and he did not meet aggrieved citizens there. But Deshmukh sat down by the gate with his daughter. Security staff informed Kherwadi police and at 11.15am, a mobile van arrived and hauled him to the police station with his daughter.

He said police made copies of his letter when he refused to give any statement or sign any paper. “My daughter was scared watching police yell and threaten us. They told her to let go of my hand and said they would throw me behind bars,” said Deshmukh. Police denied the use of force and said he was a businessman. “I used to operate two trucks to ferry bricks and soil, but the vehicles were seized by an auto finance company,” said Deshmukh.

He claimed he had fixed deposits of Rs 9.6 lakh with the bank in 2006-07. He planned a dairy business and inquired about loans. The bank said he could avail of a Rs 40-lakh loan if he mortgaged his assets. “I decided to mortgage my house. We had good relations with the bank but after demonitization, the bank said I was defaulting on the loan and my FDs were being liquidated. I was shocked as the loan was never disbursed finally. I got threats from the bank for recovery and my daughters had to drop out of school out of fear. I wrote to the governor six months back and finally decided to meet the CM,” Deshmukh said.

Meanwhile, a clash broke out between police and mediapersons at Kherwadi police station.TV reporters claimed police misbehaved with them. Zonal DCP Manjunath Shinge said he was looking into the issue.

483,['6/01/2020'],Tea Inc fears exports loss over US-Iran row,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Kolkata: Indian tea industry is keeping a close watch on the rising Iran-US conflict following the assassination of Iranian commander Maj Gen Qassim Suleimani in a US drone strike on Friday, as the West Asian nation is the largest importer of the Indian brew. Although, the ongoing decade-long US sanction on Iran has not yet hindered the exports market for Indian tea in Iran, the current whiff of a new war has left the Tea Inc worried with respect to keeping the business and price realisation intact.

The situation has arisen at a time when Iran, a permanent aficionado of Indian orthodox tea, imported a record 50.4 mkg leaves from India during January-November, 2019, at a high unit price of $3.91 (Rs 280) a kilo, against 27.41 mkg recorded in the same period in 2018. A Tea Board figure says, in value terms, the tea export to Iran has doubled from the year-ago period, at $197.4 million (Rs 1,415 crore), making it the top importer of Indian tea beating the CIS countries (led by Russian Federation) for the first time.

Indian Tea Association (ITA), the largest and oldest tea producers’ body, is keeping its fingers crossed. Arijit Raha, the secretary-general of ITA , told TOI: “Iran is an important destination for Indian tea exports and any disruption would have adverse economic consequences for the industry.”

Notably, Indian tea industry has already been jeopardised sagging government subsidy, apart from multiple other factors like erratic weather, migration of workforce, low price realisation, small domestic per capita intake and high cost of production.

ITA secretary Sujit Patra, however, reminded that India seldom lost its momentum in the Middle East despite continuous sanctions and unrest in the last 10 to 15 years. “Present sanction would present some difficulties, but tea exports will go on. From 14mkg in 2013, Iran’s intake has increased to 31mkg in 2018,” he said.

Experts believe, tea will always find its way into Iran as it is the only beverage consumed heavily in the country.

“India has Rupee-Rial mechanism (USD converted to Rial to INR) through which certain exports like tea, rice, etc are covered for repatriation. A portion of US dollar is kept for barter trading of tea. This system will continue till equivalent oil money is there,” explained Patra.

The orthodox tea exporters has been setting their sights on Iran in a big way owing to its high value realisation.

Anshuman Kanoria, chairman, Indian Tea Exporters’ Association (ITEA), feels that the escalation in tension in Iran is a cause of serious worry. “Iran is now the No. 1 importer of Indian tea and a trusted partner. At this stage, we can only watch the situation unfold and hope there is no further trouble.”

Recently Iranian Ambassador in India came to Kolkata and had intensive discussion with the Indian tea producers and exporters. ITA had signed an MoU with Iran for 30 mkg exports, which it touched in 2018.

According to Goodricke MD CEO Atul Asthana as most of the 2019 contracts have almost been shipped and as the season has now closed, there is not much to lose even if there are fresh sanctions imposed. “To see the developments as to what happens after April 2020 as the new contracts for the fresh season are done then. We will have to wait and watch.”

Tea exporters now believe that trading in Iran will continue till the two governments allow them to.

Locals say there has been a black discharge and a foul stench for a fortnight

MUMBAI: Residents living in the plush high-rise buildings of Cuffe Parade are once again waking up to a view of a blackened sea and a foul stench. While the problem has been persisting since the past fortnight, on Sunday, residents complained the black discharge had increased.

TOI had, on April 21, 2019, reported on the same issue, following which BMC had found that a civic contractor, hired to augment sewerage lines, had “incorrectly” ended up diverting these into the storm water drain (SWD), which released a blackened slick along the shore. Following the report, it was decided to levy a Rs 1 lakh penalty on the contractor.

Residents said that the discharge was not visible over the next few months as monsoon set in. However, come December, the ‘black sea view’ has reappeared.

Shirish Poonglia, vice-president of Jolly Maker 3, said, “It is scary to see the sea being polluted with this jet black discharge. On Sunday, the discharge increased. The pollution is especially unfortunate for the marine species.”

Hansu Pardiwala, who lives in Maker Towers, said they are worried the discharge is toxic and could be harmful not only to the residents, but also to the marine life.

Local corporator, Harshita Narwekar, said she got several pictures from residents, stating they saw massive discharge into the sea around 12.30 pm on Sunday.

“While there is a need to augment old sewerage lines in the area, it is unacceptable the BMC is allowing the contractor to connect the same line to the SWD network due to which sewage is being released into the sea.”

When TOI contacted BMC assistant municipal commissioner of A ward, Chanda Jadhav, she said, “When my staff inspected the site, they did not witness any discharge. However, in view of complaints from the corporator and residents, we have decided to test the water samples.”

CHENNAI: Tambaram and Pallavaram Municipalities will have to forfeit Rs 50,00,000 of funds if they don’t clear waste dumped for years at Vengadamangalam in Chennai’s southern suburbs within six months.

Hearing a case regarding unscientific disposal of waste at this site, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed chief secretary K Shanmugham to submit a report on the present status and action taken against these urban local bodies.

Environmental clearance for operating an integrated municipal solid waste management facility at Vengadamangalam was given in 2015. Accordingly, waste collected from nearby municipalities were brought to this site for segregation and processing.

A portion of the processed product — refuse derive fuel — of combustible nature triggered fire accidents within the site, thereby affecting air quality in the neighbourhood, said inspection reports by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. Besides this, government spent another ₹15 lakh for setting up compost yards, but this too was ineffective, the report said. It confirmed complaints by locals that waste was dumped in a haphazard manner, affecting groundwater and public health. TNPCB also stated that the unit was in operation without valid authorisation under SWM Rules, 2016.

In response, counsels appearing for the municipalities said that no fresh dumping was done and efforts were under way to dispose of legacy waste. NGT members Justices K Ramakrishnan and Saibal Dasgupta pulled up the local bodies for not adopting the Kumbakonam model or Indore model to handle such situations. TNPCB has been told to inspect the site to assess the damage caused by collecting water samples from neighbouring areas. NGT wanted the report within two months.

486,['6/01/2020'],No Re payment woes for Iran exports: Uco bank,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Kolkata: Despite increasing tension between the US and Iran , Indian exporters doing business with the Middle East country may not face any problem in receiving their payments in the Indian currency till this fiscal-end. The city-based Uco Bank currently has enough “availability of funds” in its rupee accounts, which had been opened to facilitate Indo-Iran bilateral trade settlements, to make payments “at least for sometime” to the exporters for shipping products to the West Asian nation, according to a senior bank official.

When asked whether Indian exporters will have any problem in getting their payments in the rupee under the “Rupee Payment Mechanism”, the Uco Bank official said: “It depends on the availability of funds. But, at least I don’t think there is any immediate problem for making payments.”

India and Iran had signed a deal in the last year for oil import payments in rupees. The MoU was signed as the US had allowed India and seven other nations to keep buying Iranian oil despite sanctions were reimposed on the Islamic state in November, 2018. According to the agreement, Indian oil companies made rupee payments in Uco Bank accounts, and 50% of those funds were earmarked for making the payments for the exports from India to Iran.

Uco Bank has been facilitating the bi-lateral banking trade transactions with Iran under the ""Rupee Payment Mechanism"" since February, 2012, as mandated by the government and RBI.

Last week, tensions between Iran and the US increased after an American drone strike killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani.

""The funds (in Uco Bank's rupee accounts) are basically freezed, whatever has come has come. Because, the rupee inflow was on account of imports from Iran. Imports from Iran were mainly in terms of crude oil. That is gone now. So, the inflow has already stopped...almost nil. It is only the outflow for the exports which are being made to Iran,"" the Uco Bank official informed.

Iran is a key trading partner of India. It imports basmati rice, cereals, tea, coffee, spices and organic chemicals, among others. ""The only problem is once this money, whatever is there in the rupee accounts, exhausts, then again we would have to think what payment mechanism has to be put in place,"" the official said, adding Indian exporters to Iran would not face any problem in getting their payments in the rupee at least till this fiscal-end.

The bank apprised the government about the situation. ""A lot of meetings are going on,"" the official said. On a possible timeline by when the government might come out with some new clarifications on the payment mechanism, he said following the latest escalation in tensions it was difficult to predict ""what turn it will take"".

BJP flag

KOLKATA: Legal action against anyone, who had to leave Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan owing to religious persecution and enter India illegally, will not come in the way of his application for citizenship under the new Citizenship Amendment Act, BJP claimed in a booklet published on Sunday. The booklet also claimed that if NRC is implemented, no member of six communities Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Parsi, Jain and Buddhists will have their names in the ‘D’ (doubtful) Voter List.

The 15-page booklet, aimed at dispelling “myths” about the new law, claimed that the six religious communities, who have been subject to religious persecution, were left with no choice other than seeking refuge in India. The booklet was distributed as BJP on Sunday began a door-to-door campaign in various parts of the state.

Union minister Babul Supriyo, while unveiling the booklet at Press Club, stressed that CAA was not a legislation which can drive out a single person from India. “Rather, it is a law to grant citizenship,” he said.

It also mentions that none of the applicants will have to produce any document related to their being persecuted in any of the three countries. “An applicant will have to file an affidavit declaring that he had been subject to religious persecution. No related document is necessary,” it read.

Supriyo added that “the provisions for seeking citizenship or asylum in India remains unchanged. The new act does not take away any right of the citizens”.

“The campaign will continue apart from our regular programmes and rallies in support of the CAA,” said Sayantan Basu, general secretary of Bengal BJP.

The pugmarks in Lakshmanpur village

JHARGRAM: Fresh pugmarks have been spotted in Binpur’s Lakshmanpur village, more than 30km from Lalgarh’s Jhitka forest where a tiger was sighted a little less than two years ago and subsequently poached.

Residents informed the forest department after spotting the pugmarks in wheat and mustard fields on Sunday morning. Foresters confirmed that they would send camera traps from the Sunderbans on Monday to decode the mystery.

The Lalgarh tiger, caught on camera traps on March 2, 2018, was poached on April 13 in West Midnapore’s Dherua area. Both Lalgarh and Binpur are in Jhargram district.

On Sunday, villager Sunil Murmu first saw the pugmarks in a mustard field 6km from Malabati forest. “I informed panchayat member Rajeeb Murmu, following which foresters and cops visited the spot, clicked pictures and collected footprints using Plaster of Paris,” he said.

Chief conservator of forests Rajeev Sharma said: “We will procure camera traps from Sunderbans and place these in the area to find out more details about the animal. There has been no report of cattle kill.”

Chief wildlife warden Ravi Kant Sinha said two pairs of camera traps would be sent to Binpur. “We expect to fix the cameras in the area by Monday late afternoon. Pictures suggest two sets of pugmarks.”

Representative image

BURDWAN/KOLKATA: One of the two persons injured in Saturday evening’s collapse of a portico at Burdwan railway station died at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital early on Sunday. His identity is yet to be ascertained.

The other injured person, Hopna Tudu (45), who was at the station to see off his daughter, was released from hospital after treatment, an Eastern Railway spokesperson said. A three-member Junior Administrative Grade inquiry committee is probing the accident.

According to ER officials, the portion that collapsed was part of a structure that is nearly 150 years old. The accident occurred even when work was on to strengthen the structure and renovate the whole station by adding murals and other decorative items. On Sunday, ER general manager Suneet Sharma visited Burdwan station to take stock of the situation and assured a thorough probe into the accident.

The debris has been cleared from the spot and the portions nearby have been strengthened using beams. Sharma said, “We have ordered a detailed inquiry. We are in consultation with IIT Kharagpur to check the structure and health status of the building. The entire damaged area will be demolished and reconstructed. This building was built in 1905.”

“The three members of the inquiry committee are from the engineering, commercial and safety departments. It will be an impartial probe and the guilty, if any, will be identified and punished,” said Nikhil Kumar Chakraborty, CPRO, ER. According to him, the inquiry committee members will be present at the chamber of the station manager of Burdwan between 4 pm and 6 pm on Monday. Those who witnessed the accident and wish to depose before the committee can do so during that period.

Hopna’s wife Rani Hansda said, “It was a close shave for all of us. We had come to see off my daughter who is an English first-year student in a Bhopal college. We were waiting in the station with other passengers. Suddenly, a concrete slab fell. I pulled my husband and the slab fell on his feet. My daughter was merely a metre away from the spot. We are still in shock.” Rani later lodged a complaint with Burdwan GRP. The FIR was lodged under several penal sections, including causing death due to negligence.

From Sunday, train speeds have been restricted to 10 km/hour so that vibrations do not impact the building.

The accident has also sparked off a political slugfest between Trinamool Congress and BJP. On Sunday, Trinamool leader and minister Swapan Debnath visited Tudu in hospital and blamed the railways squarely for the accident.

Union minister of state and BJP leader Babul Supriyo did not deny that the railways will have to take responsibility for the accident. “There shall be no passing of the buck in this case. The railways will take full responsibility for what happened. I have spoken to railway minister Piyush Goyal,” he said.

494,['6/01/2020'],The other side: Reverse flow to Bangladesh peaks,"This story is from January 6, 2020

KOLKATA: The spurt in infiltration arrests in Bangladesh over the past couple of months — around 450 since mid-November — is just the tip of the iceberg. The actual number of Bangladeshis who have illegally gone back to their homeland in the wake of the NRC scare could be several thousands, indicate intelligence and other sources. A process of regular low-key pushbacks is also on.

According to state intelligence sources, for the past few weeks, around 200 people have been infiltrating Bangladesh every day through North 24 Parganas alone. People are crossing over in large numbers through the porous riverine border in South 24 Parganas, too, and through Nadia, according to sources.

A senior official in Bangladesh said most of those arrested for illegally entering Bangladesh came from Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi and they crossed over through the borders in Maheshpur, Jhinaidaha and Jessore (from North 24 Parganas and Nadia in Bengal). Many of them were carrying Indian ration cards, Aadhaar cards and even voter ID cards, he added.

A North 24 Parganas-based tout, who is part of a racket that sends people without passports to Bangladesh, told TOI that in the past two months, they had sent around 5,000 people across the border, several times the usual number. And the “fee” that ghat-maliks (touts) charge from each dhur (client) has also risen by 25% to 50%. Till a couple of months ago, the charge for sending a person to Bangladesh was around Rs 4,000. “Then people started pouring in from Bengaluru. Now, the charge has increased to Rs 5,000 and, if the border is ‘bad’ (if there’s strict vigil), Rs 6,000. But these days, the border is rarely ‘bad’,” he added.

The situation has reached such a pass that the Bangladesh administration has formed pratirodh (resistance) committees involving border villagers to keep vigil and prevent infiltration. Alamgir Hossain, a member of one such defence committee in Jhinaidaha district, said: “We are on alert. We are trying our best to stop infiltration.” Habibur Rahman, another border villager from Maheshpur sub-district’s Samanta, said: “Bangladesh is already under pressure from lakhs of Rohingya refugees. We cannot afford to accept more people.”

Bangladesh had also suspended mobile network coverage for a one-kilometre-wide band along the border for three days “for the sake of the country’s security in the current circumstances”.

Officially, Border Security Force (BSF) would not comment on the reverse migration. Sources, however, said Bangladeshis illegally staying in India are regularly being pushed back.

Majority of Bangladesh returnees are from Bengaluru

On December 29, at a joint press briefing of BSF and Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB), the BGB DG, Shafeenul Islam, said: “We regularly apprehend persons who cross the border. These are Bangladeshis who came into India inadvertently or for work.” In all, 446 people were arrested by the BGB since November, Islam said. The BSF DG, Vivek Johri, was present at the press briefing.

From senior citizens to one-and-a-half-month-old babies — people are going in hordes. And they are being caught and handed over to police. “But since they are originally from Bangladesh, charges being given against them are very light, so that they can easily get bail and go wherever they want to,” a Bangladeshi official told TOI. According to the infiltrators, they were from Bagerhat, or Khulna, or Chapai Nababganj in Bangladesh, he said.

A majority of those are coming back from Bengaluru, the official added. They used to do menial jobs there — as domestic helps, porters, drivers, peons or garbage cleaners. “They told us their horror stories — of being threatened and slapped, of midnight knocks on doors by members of a particular political party. They claimed they didn’t get any help from the administration or police,” said the official.

The journey back to their homeland, too, is fraught with danger. Being arrested in the hands of the BGB is safe, said the official. “But many of the border touts and criminals are taking advantage of the situation. They loot whatever money these poor people have, they molest and even rape some of the women.”

Has there been any law-and-order problem in the bordering villages and towns because of the sudden influx of so many people? “No. But we have asked the villagers to be on alert,” said Sujan Sarkar, acting executive officer of Maheshpur sub-district. “There are sub-district-level law-and-order committees. We have formed special committees with village ward members as secretaries. BGB has also been roped in,” Sarkar added.

Saroj Kumar Nath, deputy commissioner, Jhinaidaha, flatly refused to talk to this correspondent. But, to Bangladeshi media, he said he had talked to several people detained by BGB. “Recently, some people (in India) started making enquiries about them, while they were evicted from their shelters. Under the circumstances, they fled to Bangladesh with the help of local traffickers and were detained by BGB,” Nath was quoted by Dhaka Tribune.

TOI tried to contact the Bangladeshi deputy high commissioner regarding the issue, but there was no response.

496,['6/01/2020'],Kolkata: 31 Jadavpur University students resign from university SFI unit,"This story is from January 6, 2020

Jadavpur University

KOLKATA: In a major setback for Jadavpur University ’s SFI unit, 31 members from the arts department have submitted their resignation to the unit president and district secretary of SFI on Saturday.

The six-page letter mentioned inaction against molestation and sexual harassment, inherent patriarchy within the leadership, resorting to unethical ways to provide admission to students, discrimination on the basis of gender, caste and taunting for smoking cigarettes and wearing short dresses as some of the major reasons for quitting the organization. The letter has been widely spread on social media.

Jaydeep Das, a student of mass communication, said there is extreme bureaucracy within the organization. “Moreover, the issues for which SFI used to mobilize masses have lost their larger perspective. It is only limited to vote politics.” Das is among the 31 members who quit the organisation.

The allegations which have come up against SFI are often used by them to target TMCP and BJP. And the mass resignation has even put the CPM in a spot. The party has sought answer from the SFI regarding the allegations, sources claimed.

On Friday, it was announced that students’ election in Jadavpur University would be held on February 19. The Arts Faculty Students Union (AFSU) is now controlled by the SFI. Somashree Choudhury, chairperson of AFSU, said: “To submit the resignations was not an unanimous decision. It became very difficult for us to work. We tried to get into a dialogue, but nothing was done to solve the problems.” She added that leaving the organisation doesn’t mean that they don’t believe in Left ideology any more. They would continue their struggle for the society.

General secretary Debraj Debnath said the matter will be dealt with democratically within the organisation. He felt that these things are being done to harm the reputation of the organization and would not have any impact on the election.

Srijan Bhattacharya, SFI state secretary, said: “We don’t claim that our organization is perfect. Like our society, the organisation also has several problems, but there is space within the organisation to try and solve these problems through dialogue. In this case, they did not wait for the investigation to come to an end. This shows that it was a pre-decided move and they did not want to resolve the issues.”

General secretary of All India Students Federation of India, Mayukh Biswas, felt that though it was sad to lose so many comrades, the organization didn’t need anyone who has developed ideological differences.

497,['6/01/2020'],"Mumbai: BEST ridership touches 34 lakh, back to its 2014 tally","This story is from January 6, 2020

A new lot first new mini AC BEST bus is first on run with passengers from Wadala depot in Mumbai on Thursday

MUMBAI: The BEST’s daily ridership has gone up by a lakh after a fleet of wet-leased buses was introduced lately. The total ridership has now touched 34 lakh which is back to the daily commuter strength of 2014-15, sources said on Sunday. The BEST also wants to expand its fleet in areas dominated by the “autorickshaw mafia” and break the backs of such cartels, said an official.

As many as 166 AC mini buses, procured on wet lease over the last two months, have been ferrying passengers short distances while there are new electric and midi buses on long-distance routes.

BEST general manager Surendrakumar Bagde said that every bus is running packed and there is more demand for red buses in many areas. “I can assure commuters will get more buses and the frequency will also improve in the coming weeks,” he said, adding that AC buses were in demand.

The 63 AC mini buses deployed on nearly a dozen routes in Andheri west are packed with standees during peak hour.

In the last two days, 21 more AC mini buses were introduced from Colaba depot to stations like Churchgate and CSMT while 25 AC mini buses were also introduced in Wadala, Bagde said. Sources said that the fleet which had reduced to less than 3,200 six months back is now gradually increasing and would soon cross the 4,000-mark.

However, commuters told TOI there is need for more buses. “We do not want to wait for long at stops. Like railway platforms, these days bus stops get crowded if the wait is 10 minutes,” said commuter Vikas Agarwal. “Everyone wants to travel with a minimum ticket of Rs 5 in ordinary buses and Rs 6 for AC. It saves money.”

A few days ago, BEST had entered into an area dominated by autorickshaws and taken away 400 daily trips in Jogeshwari (west) where it launched two new routes from the station to Oshivara depot and to Millat Nagar on weekends. It is determined to break into this and similar autorickskshaw bastions — the next focus being Bandra (east) which is known for its autorickshaw cartels. “We also want to introduce the fleet of AC mini buses in Kurla (west) which will go past Bandra-Kurla Complex and connect to Bandra station,” said the official.

A taxi driver who stays in Bandra (east) said that autorickshaw drivers here charge “abnormally high” fares. The minimum share auto fare within Bandra-Kurla Complex, to commute even a short distance is Rs 20. This means that the driver gets Rs 60 for three commuters and the driver may charge up to Rs 40 per passenger. Those who are new to the city get fleeced and end up paying higher share fares.
